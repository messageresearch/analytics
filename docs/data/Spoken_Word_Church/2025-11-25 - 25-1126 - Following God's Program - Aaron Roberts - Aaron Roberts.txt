Y'all just y'all just eat and enjoy yourself. Have fellowship. Looking forward to a wonderful time. Thank God for all of his blessings, all of his provisions and everything he's done for us this year. And sometimes you begin to think it's hard to believe the year's almost over with. Today's the 25th. So, we got a month a month from today be Christmas, man. Things just flying by, but uh we know the Lord's got bigger and better things for us. &gt;&gt; We know we got a lot lot to look forward to. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're looking forward to that. And uh I know we got some uh brother Chris Long will be coming and brother uh Scott Smith and looking forward to brother Scott coming. Really, really wonderful brother. And uh had an opportunity to minister for him a few times and just really look really just a precious brother and we look forward to him being here for watch night service and always have a good time at watch night service. I've always enjoyed it and just thank God for all these blessings. If you have your Bibles tonight we're going to go to the book of Hosea chapter 6 and begin at verse one. familiar scripture tonight and uh entitled this uh following God's program and uh you know last last time we preached on the path of life and uh David said thou will show me the path of life. Well, if the Lord's going to show you the path to walk now you got to follow the path that God lays before you and just walk the way the path that he has for us. And So before we read the scripture tonight, let's just all pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day, Lord. All your blessings on us. And Lord, we just pray that you just come speak to us tonight. Lord, help us. Lord, just say something that be edifying to the body. And Lord, just minister to each one that's here. Lord, those that are not here, whatever the needs are, Lord, we just commit them to you in the name of Jesus. We just pray that everything is said for your honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Hosea 6 verse one it says come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us. He hath smitten and he will bind us up. After two days he will revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former reign unto the earth. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. And we know this is a this is a prophecy to Israel. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we realize that this prophecy was given unto them that the Lord that he says let us return to the Lord. And he said after two days he will revive us and the third day he will raise us up. We know that's a prophecy to them but it's also a prophecy to us in the end time that that because we are a spiritual type of Israel. So we understand that the word comes and there's going to be a restoration to us. And then he says, "And we shall know if we follow on to know the Lord &gt;&gt; if we follow what the Lord has for us." And you know, as as we were saying last time, you know, if if you know the path that he's going to show you, the path that he wants you to walk, the path of life, the path of eternal life for us to go down, then if we follow that, then if we walk in the path that God has for us, if we just continue on into that, then God will bless us and we'll be blessed in everything that we have. &gt;&gt; And this is uh I want to start out with this. This is a this is a quote from the message God hath a provided way and and and brother Brandham here he's he's speaking of children raising children and you know talking about uh you know God provided a a way for babies to get what they need and ask for them to cry you know he was talking about you know uh you know we're a modern family and you know just ring the bell junior and well you know what babies ain't going to ring no bell you know there's one thing they going they're going to exercise their lungs to full capacity to get what they need. And that's God's provided way for them. &gt;&gt; And you know, he was talking about raising children and he was talking about Joseph and he was talking about, you know, he said Joseph was really spoiled because, you know, everybody the way everybody had treated him. And he says, he said, "But I would rather have him that way. I believe it'll make him a better man out of him if God lets him live than to let him scream and cry and upset his little self. He said a few years ago, some mo normal, listen, normal modern witch doctor said, "Let that baby cry. Don't pick it up." He said, "All things like that, don't let grandma touch it." And you know what they hatched out? You see what it is? A juvenile delinquency. a bunch of neurotics. God made a baby to be loved. That's why he made a mother to love a baby. That's why we are supposed to be this way. &gt;&gt; God made it that way. &gt;&gt; And anytime that you upset God's program, you must remember you're wrong and will be wrong as long as you're upsetting God's program. &gt;&gt; Follow God's program. &gt;&gt; Do it the way God said to do it. And so, you know, whatever God's program is, whatever whatever God has us for us to do, then we're to follow that &gt;&gt; because there's only one way that God provided for anything, and that's by the word. &gt;&gt; And you know, many times, you know, we we have a a way of trying to come up with our own ideas or, you know, what whatever the whatever the doctors have said, the psychologist, the psychiatrist, you know, the modern day world says. But you know what? It's if whatever we have need of in this life, whatever God has for us, he's given to us in the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's all right here for whatever we have need of for us in this journey has been given to us in the word. &gt;&gt; And so we have everything. And so if we'll just follow what God has for us, then we we'll be successful. And you know, there's many things that that God has for us that he wants us to go, but we've got to follow that path. There's a path that he and brother brother Emanuel read my scripture Sunday in in Sunday school and after church I didn't say nothing to him but uh Jeremiah 6:16 you know he was reading this he said thus sayith the Lord he said stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls and they said we will not walk therein' That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know, everything that they had need of was right there. &gt;&gt; When the prophet Jeremiah was speaking to the children of Israel and telling them this is what God, he said, "Stand in the ways in the ways that you know." And he said, "And ask for the old paths &gt;&gt; because to carry you right back to the place that God started you on &gt;&gt; to the to the place that your fathers and your forefathers were to go right back to that." And it was to you &gt;&gt; because it's the exact same thing that when the when Peter and the 11 stood up on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came upon them, it was the exact same message that they came out and said this is these men are not drunk as you suppose. But he said this is that what the prophet had spoken unto them. &gt;&gt; And he said to carry you right back. He said, "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and it's unto you and to your children, and to them that's a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." So, it's unto everybody. And so, it's just like to them, the children of Israel, Jeremiah is calling out to them that God has a place for you, a plan for you, and a path for you to walk in. And they said, "We won't do it." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it didn't fit their plan. It they didn't like it. But you know what? It was a perfect way for them because they knew exactly the path that their fathers had walked. They knew exactly the path that their forefathers had walked. They knew every victory they had, but they knew every defeat. &gt;&gt; They knew every stumbling that they had. They knew every bondage that they had went through. They they had seen all of all of the turmoil and everything that they had been through. And Jeremiah is crying out saying, "Guess what? You got a path to walk. You've got a victory to overcome. You've got all these blessings of God. But you will not do that. &gt;&gt; But it was laid out before him. &gt;&gt; So whatever we have, you know, everything that we have need of is given to us in this earthly journey. The word is given to us &gt;&gt; and all you got to do is follow it. But you know many times you know we we for different reasons whatever whatever the reasons may be you know we have different things that that we face from our from our lifetime. You know you know every brother called it the the human grab bag. You know we all we all suffer from different things. We all carry baggage and you know our our personalities are different and all these different things that we carry you and you know we all battle different different things and you know some people they don't they don't have to battle depression other people know what what depression is and you know you know if for some people you know it's almost debilitating and you know um I I've told this story before but I I was everybody knows my birthday is February 12th. I was born on Abraham Lincoln's birthday. And you know, I'm not saying that I'm a lot like that, but but there's traits that I have that I see in Abraham Lincoln. And what was when I was younger, I was reading all these books because anything had Abraham Lincoln, it was I was reading it. I I just So that was that was I was my hero. That was my idol. And you know, I just like, you know, I just I just loved everything about him. Brother Ram said, you know, greatest president we had and all that. You know what a great Christian, godly man we had. Well, you know, I got to reading about things that he had battled in his life and everything like that. And you know, there's certain things that I saw in his life in the writings and stories. And it's like, you know, it began for it was through that I began to understand my my personality. There were things about me that I understood because I I see these things and they talk about you know he went through periods of being melancholy and all these different things and you know uh different types different things in your personality you know the way being very studious and and just different things that he had went through in his life and the way approached things and it was like you know that that meant something to me because I I you know I was like I I connect to that I see that and you know sometime you know it's just because of the the sign that you're born under and all those type things, but you know, you you go through all of those things and you you have to overcome those and you deal with these things and everybody deals with different things, but you know, God get put you in in a certain place. You know, he brought you into this place. You you have all of the characteristics that God wanted you to have. And you know, sometimes I I I look in the mirror and I'm thinking, why did God want me to have this? You know, and it's like, I don't see a benefit to that. But you know somewhere down the line it will be a benefit to you because you know you are made uniquely. You are made in God's image and everything about you is exactly the way God wanted you to be. &gt;&gt; You you think about I think it's I think it's 10 generations if you count back all your direct in descendants and y'all may y'all can check my math on this because but I think there like 4,000 if you count back your generations. every generation. I think that if you count 10 generations backs like 4,000. You got to think that's four over 4,000 people that had to go through famines and fires and wars and everything imaginable for that person. And they had to travel distances and all those things for those people to come together &gt;&gt; for the for for your great great great great great great grandmother to meet her husband. And you know, then you start thinking about, you know, way back on the other side of the ocean in England and Ireland and all these things and all the things that they had to go through for them to meet and then have children and all the things that they had to go through. Then they had to travel across the ocean. And then you think of all the journeys that your families had had to go through. You think about all of the things that they you know and you it's like I always think about my grandfather you know being in World War II and you know he was standing there you know he landed in I believe it was France Richard may remember it more than me but when he landed in France there was 50s something men hit that beach and there's only two of them that survived him and the man next to him when he was standing there and my great-grandmother was praying when he was when he was in combat and he said he said he heard the he said I heard the bullets going all around me. There's nothing between him and the enemy. But he said, I could hear the the machine guns, the bullets going to the left and to the right. And him standing there and saying, I don't know about y'all, but he said, "The angel of the Lord was standing in front of me to see the bullets go to the left and to the right." And all of the things that that that he had went through, he got left. He got they they were in snow and it might have been France. I'm not exactly sure where they they were in Europe. But uh they all hunched down in a ditch and went to sleep and the snow fell on him. And when he woke up, he was by himself. He was still covered up. When they woke up all the rest of the soldiers and left in the middle of the night, they left him in the ditch in the snow. and he got up and started trying to sneak around and thank God he was able to get back to the allies to figure out where his unit was. But all the things that he come through and you you look at your family, all of those that came through all of those things to bring you to the place where and you know you think one person, one person out of cater and you're and you're not the person, but you know, you think that was what God had in his mind in the beginning. He saw you in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are today exactly the picture of God in his mind. &gt;&gt; And it came all the way through to get to you right today. &gt;&gt; And if and if and if he remembers if he saw that and you're here today, then you know what? If he brought you to this place, then how much more when you think of the astronomical amount of work that it took? Then how much more is he going to carry you all the way? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there was one day that he knew that you were going to receive eternal life, that you were going to receive the word &gt;&gt; and that he brought you the way that he wanted you to look. &gt;&gt; Whether whether we like it or not, all our faults and failures, our blemishes, but that's the way God wanted us to be. &gt;&gt; And now we have come to the place that God wants us to be. Then if God has done all that to bring us to this place, then how much more is he going to carry you all the way? &gt;&gt; That you've got that you've got a place to go. You've got a role to do. &gt;&gt; You've got a you've got a part to play in this. &gt;&gt; God's not God's not complete without you. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes sometimes we think, well, you know, we're not all that important. Well, you may you may try to find a piece of paper and try to write down, you know, what what what's great about me or, you know, whatever. But, you know, you're important to God. &gt;&gt; You're great to God &gt;&gt; because you know what? If if if you and I if it was just one, if there was just one lost, then he would have went to Calvary just for that one. Amen. &gt;&gt; The plan of salvation would have just been for one &gt;&gt; that he would have he would have done that for you and I. &gt;&gt; That if he would have done that for you that he thought of you when he was on the cross I was on his mind. &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross he done this just for me. when he when he went down through all that and knew what he would suffer, knew what was going to take place, knew they would spit in his face and pull his beard out, knew that his friends would turn their backs on him. &gt;&gt; And you know what? He didn't reject them. All the things that he knew that was going to take place, all the stripes he was going to take on his back for your healing. would stand there and be ash put put to an open shame for you and I. &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Why? Because he stood for me when I when I was when I was nothing. When I was lost and undone and had no hope, he was my hope. He was the one that came to find me, &gt;&gt; to bring me back into fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; What a thanksgiving we got. &gt;&gt; We can give God thanks for what he's done for us. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what? All you all he has to have is a willing vessel. &gt;&gt; That's all he needs is somebody to be willing. You don't have to you don't have to be great because you know we cannot do the plan of God by ourselves. But he said greater is he that sent us than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; You know what he's he's got he gives you the strength to do it. &gt;&gt; I don't know about y'all. I might run around for a little bit or jump up and down or something, [snorts] &gt;&gt; you know, because when you realize what God's done for you, you can try to talk to the world about it and the world don't understand it, but that's all right. They call us crazy if they want to, but &gt;&gt; that's all right. I'm I'm having a good time. You know, I was I was I was listening to a man just recently, and you know, when you see the things what God has done for you and and God's called you to do something, you're important in God's plan and and there's a purpose and everything for you. And you know, we we we try to sometimes we think that we're not well, I'm not as good as somebody else or I don't. But you know what? Find your place. Whatever your place is, that's what God wants you to be. I want to be I want to be the best Aaron Roberts that I can be &gt;&gt; because you know I can't be anybody else. &gt;&gt; I'd ra I'd rather I'd rather be a poor original than a good impostor &gt;&gt; or a good counterfeit &gt;&gt; or a good reproduction. &gt;&gt; Because God don't use reproductions. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be him made manifest. And so if you understand that who you are and what God wants us to do, you know, we understand what God has called us to do. But I was listening to this man. He was talking about he was uh his church has what they what they call coffee. They call it the coffee ministry. On Sunday mornings, they have coffee and donuts and pastries and all this kind of stuff. He said they were looking for they were looking for volunteers. [snorts] Well, he's an evangelist and he said, "I'm gone three day." He said, "I'm gone three Sundays a month." And he's like, but you know, he said, the Lord kept telling me, he said, "You need to do this. You need to do this." And he was like, "Um, well, that would only be the one Sunday that I'm home a month would be the only Sunday." And he's just like, well, it was really impressive. He said, "The Lord," he said, he told his wife, said, "Hey, we're going to go we're going to go work in the coffee and donut ministry. We've done all kinds of other ministries. We're going to do this one." And he's like, you know, you know, he felt kind of funny getting started doing this. But, you know, he started doing it and you know what he said? He began to be blessed by it. And he said you he began to fellowship with these people and he said God began to minister to people and God began to touch lives and you know you get to know people and all these things that were taking place through this ministry. And he said well you know people think it was just coffee and donuts but he said you begin to have real fellowship and God began to move and was able to minister to people one- on-one. And you know I was thinking about brother Brown I think it was in the in the seals. You know brother Brown was talking about the people he said you know brother Neville and all of them would be at the church there. uh one of the services they were having and you know he was like if you've never been personally ministered to he said just come up to the church we'll be here and you know I was I was thinking about that you know it's it was such a simple thing but you know sometimes that's that's a one way that somebody can reach out that you can reach out to somebody and touch their lives and it it's like it's not very hard and he said he said I I got to the point he said that was a that I just enjoyed that was the favorite part of my day you know was just going to church he said I got up in the morning he said listen I'm going you know I enjoy enjoyed it so much. He said, "Because you think you're blessing people?" He said, "They're blessing me." And he said, "I got excited about going to church just just to help people and have fellowship." And he said, "Man, it was so good." And I I was talking to brother Jason Watkins while we were down there the other week and, you know, talking about having fellowship, you know, and you know, after church, you know, getting together and having fellowship. And he said that's that's such a faith booster. You know, it's such a wonderful thing to have fellowship. And you know, some people they come to church and as soon as the doors are out, you know, they're running to their car, jumping in and heading out the door. It's like, you know what? You're really missing a blessing if you don't get to spend time with your brothers and sisters and have fellowship with one another and gather around and, you know, and and have that fellowship. And it's just a wonderful thing. And he, you know, he said after a while, the the Lord began to deal with him. He's like, "Well, now it's time for you to finish this." And he's like, "Well," he's like, "I've done it for three years." and he's like, "I don't want to stop." And the Lord kept telling him, he said, "Well, you got other things to do, you know, you know, and it's like you go through these these uh periods in your life, you know, these seasons of life." And and he's like, you know, it's time to finish one and do something else. And he said, it's like, you know, you know, the the Lord has to push you into getting something started. And then when you get started, when the Lord wants you to do something else, it's like, you know, you're you're digging your heels and it's like and it's like, you know, you had that same you had that same attitude back here when you started. &gt;&gt; You remember that same attitude where you didn't want to get started and then you get started, now it's time to change to do something else and you want to dig your heels in. It's like, well, now sometimes it's time to change &gt;&gt; because people don't want to change. they they get they get set in their ways and you know it's like well I just want to get be comfortable this way you know but you know you go through seasons of growth in your life and time to times to change and and go through these things. It's like listen you know you think well I I don't want to go through this or whatever but you know you don't realize how much of a blessing you can be by by changing and doing other things because God's called you to do other things. And it's like, well, you know, I I you know, it's my mentality. You know, I have just these certain thoughts. And it's like, no, they whatever God wants you to do, then to be open to that, Lord, I want to do whatever you want me to do. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, we we go through that and it's like, well, I, you know, well, I'm not I'm not the best singer. Well, you know, if you're not the best singer, then you know what? make a joyful noise and and be the be the most joyful noise in the building. &gt;&gt; You know what? And if you if you can't sing, then you know, be at least be encouragement to somebody. &gt;&gt; You know, always have a smile on your face or whatever. You know, whatever you can do, make sure that you're because if something's on the inside and it's got if it's burning, as brother Wes always says, then let it out. You know, if there's something on the inside, then let it out. You know be you know sometimes uh when when this man was was telling about these you know about working and and serving is you know these simple acts we look at as simple acts but he said you know God does great things in simple acts &gt;&gt; and you we think of it just as a simple act but you know what if we don't if we look to see what God's doing we see great things taking place and we miss those things those great things that take place You know, when when we come to church in in in the mornings and you know, I I was listening to him. I was thinking about, you know, when we when we come to church and everybody's like, "Well, you know, I got to wait till the church or or or something." You know, don't miss out on God. I know the devil's going to ride with you on Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; He rides with me. I don't know about about y'all, but he rides with me in the car. And it's and and and it's it's not Sarah. So, I'm I'm I'm gonna put that out there right now. &gt;&gt; And it ain't Levi and it ain't Adam. &gt;&gt; But you know what? The devil likes to ride in the car with you. And sometimes as soon as the alarm clock goes off on Sunday morning, the devil's right there. And he'll fight you all the way. But you know what? And everybody's like, "Well, just we get aggravated about things and upset, but you know what? We also realize God's right there with us, too." &gt;&gt; And he was talking about, you know, if we if we looked at the things correctly, the devil's trying to hinder you, but you know what? You don't have to come to church, even though hearing the hearing the word preached, you know, you can receive your healing while the while the word's being preached. &gt;&gt; But you know what? You can get healed in the car on the way to church in the morning &gt;&gt; when the devil's out there trying to stop you on Sunday morning and the Lord's right there with you. If you realize the that God's right there and he's trying to talk to you, that's the reason that the devil's trying to hinder you. &gt;&gt; You wake up in the morning say, "Oh, I got such a headache. My knees bothering me." Everything like that. You know what? The angel of the Lord's right there to touch you. &gt;&gt; He's right there to minister to your need. And you don't have to come to church, stand in the church building. You don't have to come up and have hands laid on you or anything like that. You know what? Because he can touch you in the car. &gt;&gt; But where what's the first thing you do? You get in the car. You start going down the road. And then you start thinking on the good things of God. You start thinking of you thank God. I thank God I got up this morning. As brother Wade was talking about them the list of devils that ride with you. You know, the coffee wasn't good this morning. and you know this didn't work out and that didn't work out and whatever else you know I couldn't find my shoes they can't find the boys can't find their shoes or or whatever else is not going on you know we ain't got no gas in the car whatever the devil puts in your way but you know what say well you know what I've seen people they didn't have gas in their car get in their car and crank the car and they didn't have a way but you know what they got in their car cranked it and drove all the way to church with no gas I've seen people's car break down &gt;&gt; and God fix their car. &gt;&gt; I've seen supernatural things happen. &gt;&gt; But you know what? It's like we get we get Well, you know what? Well, we're just going to go to church. Brother Wade's going to get up here and he's just going to say pretty much what he said Wednesday night. or he's going to get up and he's just going to get on my he gonna get on my step on my toes or whatever else and not realizing that when you come to church Sunday morning, the creator of heaven and earth is coming to meet with you &gt;&gt; and SPEAK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IT'S NOT HIM JUST coming and taking a scripture and reading it, but he's coming to speak into your life &gt;&gt; what you have need of &gt;&gt; for you to receive it. &gt;&gt; And he's reading the wheel that tells you who you are &gt;&gt; and what you're what your inheritance is. &gt;&gt; And the devil don't want you to hear that. and he wants you to come in and carry this big boulder on your shoulder as you walk around. But you know what? If because you know people don't have chips on their shoulder anymore, &gt;&gt; chips are too small. &gt;&gt; They got boulders on their shoulders. &gt;&gt; But it's time to GET THAT OFF. BUT YOU COME IN THE IN THE HOUSE of God and realize, you know what? I've come in the presence of God and he's here to meet with me. And not really because you know a lot of people say, "Well, I wonder if I'm going to hear from God today. &gt;&gt; You know who's tell who you know who's talking to you? &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; The liar. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you going to hear?" Absolutely. You're going to hear from God. &gt;&gt; The question is, are you gonna receive anything from it? &gt;&gt; Are you gonna get under the spout where the glory comes out? Are you gonna sit around with a long face and pout? &gt;&gt; Because you know what? It's up to you whether you gonna receive it or not. &gt;&gt; But you can receive whatever you have need of. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is get there. &gt;&gt; Well, thank God I'm I'm going. And if and if nobody else goes, I'm going to go and I'm gonna get my portion. I'm g I'm gonna soak it all up and I'm I'm I'm just because you know if you think about it you come to church you know you go to a ball game and you know you don't see all these long faces &gt;&gt; and you know what they come they come they come for a ball game. &gt;&gt; Me and Adam went to a ball game the other day. I ain't never I ain't never seen so many people dressed like that before. But you know what? They were excited to be there. And you know what? Everybody, well, we're here to watch a ball game. Well, you know, if people get excited about that, then you know what? If you come, if you knew that the God of heaven and earth &gt;&gt; was coming to speak to you this morning, you know, because if you everybody say, "Oh, boy." You know, if Jesus was here this morning, I'd be here with bells on. Be ready to hear from him. There's people said, "You know what? If if if I could if I could get an interview with Brother Brandham, if Brother Brandham was here and I could and I could and I could have a personal interview with Brother Brandham, you know what? I'd go anywhere in the world. I I'd do whatever I could to get there. Do you know that the God of heaven and earth will meet you wherever you are &gt;&gt; in your house?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And lots of times he speaks to us and we miss him &gt;&gt; and we don't listen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we fail to realize that God's trying to speak to us. &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's because we don't like the vessel that is coming through &gt;&gt; because we're not listening to the word. We're looking at personalities. And we wonder why we have problems and why we're hindered. &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, I don't care who if you speak through the donkey, through the wind, whoever it is, Lord, if you're speaking to me, I want you to hear. I want I want to be conscious enough. &gt;&gt; I want to be spiritual enough to realize that you're speaking to me. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to miss out. &gt;&gt; I want to receive what you have for me. See, if you if you receive, think about that. You come in the house of God, well, you know, if you get on fire, somebody else will get on fire. &gt;&gt; You know, like they always say, if there's fire in the pull pit, there's smoke in the pews. Not any fire extinguishers or wet blankets. &gt;&gt; But you know what? If you come in the house of God, if you get on fire, you know what? Somebody else going to get on fire, too. It starts with one person. You know, every every great revival started with one person. &gt;&gt; You know, it ain't never, as far as I know, unless somebody can tell me different, I've never se I've never seen a revival start anywhere by committee. It takes one person to get out of their comfort zone, to get over themselves, to get to the place where they get in the spirit. And when they get in the spirit and they get on fire, then you know what? Everybody else will get on fire, too. &gt;&gt; If we get in one If we get in one mind and one accord, then you know what? It It's not It's not hard to preach, Brother Wade. When when everybody's pulling in the same direction, &gt;&gt; if we realize that God's come to speak to us today, then you know what it we we all get excited. &gt;&gt; If we was passing out $100 bills, people get excited. You know, it was so funny. I was I was thinking of Mercy. I was How's she doing? I know she had oral surgery today. Well, good. Mercy's listening in. But, you know, I was when I preached on phobias, you know, being fearless in a world of fear. You know, we we live in a world of fear. So many people out there in the in the world and they got and they they write great big books on all the phobias and everything you can think of people's afraid of. And if and if you can think of it, somebody's afraid of it. You know, and you begin to look at some of these things and it's like, you know, what is a phobia? It's a rational fear. is something that can't hurt you. You know, one one of the one of the most fascinating ones that that I I found was that there there's people that's a that that's that's has a phobia that's afraid of the cotton bowl that's in medicine bottles. No joke. I've been I' I've been afraid of a lot of things. I ain't never I ain't never been afraid of a cotton bowl, but I mean there was a there was a lady that that she went she she wanted to be a school teacher, elementary school teacher, and she couldn't she couldn't touch a cotton ball and they tried to get her touch cotton ball. She started sweating almost hyperventilating over a cotton ball and she went she went to go have treatment so she could be a school teacher. I was like, you know, I would I you know, my my you know, I have a health I have a healthy fear of being in the woods and uh something bigger than me coming at me, you know, great big long snakes. Little snakes don't bother me, you know, bears or anything like that. You know, something that may eat me, I have a problem with that. But, you know, I mean, there's a lot of things that that I that I'm not afraid of, you know, but you know, you you but you go through there's people that are afraid of colors and butterflies and all these little things and it's like, you know what, I've had I've had all kinds of bugs on me. You know, I've had ticks and everything else like that and I ain't never I ain't never had have go hyperventilating over over something on me. But you but you see all these people that they live in they live in this world and and it's and it's so so unbelievable. But you know to them that's that's real. I mean hey they wouldn't touch it certain colors or whatever they they they'd die first. But I was talking about mercy you know and you know you know she hated she hates a crowd. you know, years ago, she had to get in front of people. And I called her up here that time, you know, I wanted her to stand up here in the front. I was like, "You don't like being up here, do you?" She want to be up here. No. But, you know, I was I was talking about her being up here. I was like, you know, being fearless in a world of fear. And I said, "The reason she came up here was because I asked her to. I I asked her and she came up here because of me." And she stood right here and I told her, I said, 'If you look at all these people, and I said, 'If you realize how much these people love you and these people are in your corner &gt;&gt; and these people are all for you. And I said, these people pray for you. I said, if you begin to look at that, you'll see things differently. And I and I I I brought up here for that for that reason. And what I had was I had money. I give it to her because I said, "You done something for me because I asked you, but you didn't realize that there's something greater beyond this because of what you done. There's a greater blessing in it that she didn't see, but she answered the call." And she went and done what I asked her to do because of her because of what because of her love for me, because what she thinks of me, she would do that. And I was like, "Here you go." Well, as soon as I give her that money, there's certain people in this building. Namely, Brother Louise. Brother Luis. He was ready to jump up. Brother, I'll come help you. That's right. I say I say I sing that. He said, "Hey," he's like, he said, "Yes, President President Jackson changed his mind." He s He saw that and he's like, "Hey, you know, I I feel the call now." But you know what? If you do that, then you know what? God will use you. And then all of a sudden, other people will begin to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; It's like, "Well, well, I don't know about doing this." Or you know what? If you step out on faith, how many people are in the scripture today that we read in the scripture that we that they there's no scripture that says that if you touch the hem of Jesus' garment that you'll be made whole. &gt;&gt; As far as I know, there ain't no scripture. But you know what she said inside of herself? She said, "All I got to touch, I don't even have to touch him. But if I just touch the hem of his garment, &gt;&gt; the virtue that's inside of him is is flowing from him. All I gota do is touch the hem of his garment and I'll be made whole. &gt;&gt; The scripture says that they laid in the shadow of Peter and the apostles and were made whole. &gt;&gt; Because they saw Jesus Christ in them. There was a sister that was one time there in the tabernacle, I believe it was, and you know, she was walking and she said, "Just let just show me where brother Brandham has walked." And she said, "Just let me walk on the ground." Same ground he's walked on. Just show me where he's walked. I'll be made whole. Man, what kind of faith to have. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? If he's if he's honored th those people's faith and they've gotten healed, then you know what? He'll do the same thing for you. &gt;&gt; And if you if you show up the things that God has delivered you from, then you know what? If he's delivered one person from that, you know what? You don't have to suffer from that. &gt;&gt; There's lots of people that's had all kinds of of addictions and all kinds of hurts that they've carried from their childhood, all kinds of things that they've been through. I I enjoyed brother Marcus Becker when he was here was here and he was talking about all the things that people have had to battle and all the scars that people You know what God is here to deliver you and to heal you and free you from those things. &gt;&gt; It's like well you just you just believe God and you know watch him come on the scene. If you just if you just take him at his word, see if God don't come on the scene and do what he says he'll do. &gt;&gt; He's He's He's here. He's real. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Well, I've I I don't I don't know." Take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Who's who tells you he can't do it? The scripture don't. &gt;&gt; Tell me who says he won't. The prophet don't tell you that he won't do it. The five-fold ministry won't tell you that he won't do it. Who's telling you that? The devil. The enemy is going to try to stop you. He going to try to hinder you. But you know what? He's still real and he'll do exactly what he says he'll do. All you got to do is take him at his word. See whatever we have need of there's a brother said there's always a way of escape. If you want to overcome something there's always a way made if you follow God's program. He said that's the way you can do it. See all you got to do is get in the word and walk in the word and walk the way God has for you. Just take it and walk. Whether you stumble or fall, whatever it is, you just keep walking in it. &gt;&gt; He g He's gonna lead you in a path and you just follow the path that God puts in front of you and see if God don't minister. Just just like Abraham, God called him out of his out of his house, his kindred, his father's house, and put him on a journey. And you know, all he had to do was keep walking. Every place he put his foot was a possession. &gt;&gt; Whether whether he stumbled, he fell, he lied, whatever it was, you know what? It didn't change the promise. &gt;&gt; God brought kept him in fellowship. &gt;&gt; You know, all you got to do is you fall. Praise God. You know, we don't we don't have to go and and gravel and do penance or anything like that. &gt;&gt; All he wants is an honest and contrite heart. And what does the scripture say? He's faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Hey, you fall and fail. That's all right. You just keep walking. I'm walking I'm walking in this way because this way God called me. And guess what? When I fall, the Bible says that I can I can ask for forgiveness and repent. And you know what? He's going he's going to forgive me. &gt;&gt; And you know what? God's not God's not holding you back. He's trying to bring you back into fellowship with him &gt;&gt; to keep on walking &gt;&gt; because you know what? Your children, you didn't turn your children out and throw them out of the house because of the things they done. Thank God our parents didn't do that to us. You know, sometimes sometimes, you know, I always I always told everybody, my dad, you know, my dad, he he spoke the truth and you know, when he when he said that he was going to knock you in the middle of next week, he done his dead level best to do that. If he said, you know, I'm going to knock the fire out of you. Well, you know what? He worked on it. You had to give him A for an effort. But you know what? He, you know, but you know what? It set us on the right path. Yeah, we got corrected and we didn't like it. But you know what? It we benefited from it. &gt;&gt; We're better off for it. &gt;&gt; But you know what? So is our heavenly father does the same thing for us. &gt;&gt; If you if you fall and fail, guess what? He didn't he ain't stopped loving you. &gt;&gt; And he's encouraging you to keep on going. &gt;&gt; Keep on pressing. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, you just keep doing it. You know, you you you fall and make mistakes. That's all right. There's a blood that covers our sins. There's there's one there's an advocate for us. You know, I I was thinking about where Brother Brown, you know, when Sister Hope was getting ready to pass and, you know, she went in there and she was laying there dying and she was telling Brother Brandham, you know, you know where we made our mistake. She stood there and you know, she wanted Brother sit down and like, Bill, you know where we made our mistake? We didn't answer the call when God called us the first time. We didn't go to the Pentecostal people. But you know what? She stood there and was dying and I got you got two babies to take care of. But she said, "Go to those people. Do what God wants you to do." She's like, you know, my life is over with, but you know, she is so encouraging to him. Listen, you get up and go what God wants you to do. You follow what God has for you. You know, you fall, then you know what? Be an encouragement to somebody. You keep you keep fighting the battle. You keep pressing the battle. You keep doing what God wants you to do. You know, you you fall and fail. That's all right. God's made a way. He's m he's made a way. When it don't look like there's a way, he makes a way. &gt;&gt; He's made a way for all of us. Thank God we have a God that's rich in mercy that'll carry us all the way through. He's made a way for all of us. And you say, "Well, I don't I don't see it." That's all right. Just be like Peter stepping out of that boat. I don't know what I'm going to step out on, but you know, I got faith to believe what God said that I can step out on it and I'm going to walk on the water. Because you know what he said? He I asked him, he said, "Lord, if if it be you, bid me to come. Come." And you know what? He He got to do something nobody else got to do. Tell you what, I ain't never had a chance to walk on water. But God calls us. He wants us to do this. Then, well, see, everything that God has for us, he lays out here for us. But God wants us to do what he's called us to do. Brother Ram said, he said, this is from the message, my new ministry. And he said, he was speaking about, you know, we know that people are not, not everybody's going to receive it. Not everybody's going. It's not for everybody. He said, "But you know, but you know," he said, "But so why why are you calling to people and why are you why are you proclaiming this?" He said, 'Because that's part of God's plan to preach the gospel because you know, we don't know who it's going to come to, but it's coming to somebody and somebody's going to receive it. &gt;&gt; So, we're not we're not going to be quiet about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says he said, "But he said so, listen to this." He said, "God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I." And as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do, we're paralyzing his program. &gt;&gt; But when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost, then we're in God's will doing his program. &gt;&gt; If we follow what God has, then you know what? We wonder why things are not moving. It's like, "Well, I don't see God moving. Wonder what's going on." Well, look at ourselves. &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, am am I the hindrance? Am I not doing what what I need to be doing? Am I shining the light to other people that other people can see what needs to be done? Am I living the right kind of life &gt;&gt; to show other people? You know that that I that's what I want to do that everybody else can see the the plan of God that I want I want to be a example that people can see. But don't don't let these things hinder you. Don't let things hold you back. You know, you take these things that God shows and you you look at them and and make sure that's that's the will of God. You know, because sometimes we get we get in our minds, well, I don't know about this or I don't know about that. I was thinking about brother Brandon when he was talking about he said they were in in the church one day and he said they they got in there and they had a singing and he said all of a sudden that young girl jumps up and she starts dancing in the aisle and all he could think of is what are what are the people in the church thinking about me looking at this girl dancing in my church? Well, because you know what? He had too much of his Baptist doctrine and he was like I well I just I just can't imagine this and he was like you know what he stopped and he began to think hey why would she do that and then all of a sudden he began to think well you know what people dancing in the spirit is because they got victory. He said, "Miriam and the and the children of Israel with the and the daughters when they crossed over the Red Sea, they got up and danced and had a good time. They didn't care who who saw them &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? They had victory." &gt;&gt; And David got up and danced when the ark of the covenant came back into the camp. And he didn't care who saw him. And he said, "If you think I acted a fool today," he said, "Come back tomorrow." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not ashamed. Because you know what? If you got victory, you don't mind showing what you got. &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't holding you back. It ain't hindering you. And he was standing there and he was thinking, "Well, you know what? She's got more victory than I got." And he said, "Well, you know what? If I got victory, I could do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Why don't I get up and dance also?" He said, "Well, they got to singing." He said, "Well, next thing you know," he said, "I got to patting my foot and enjoying myself and realizing, you know what? I could I could do the same thing. If I had the victory, you know what? I wouldn't be hindered by that either." And then all of a sudden, next thing you know, he said, "I was up there dancing in the aisle with her. We was both dancing in the aisle. Both had her because you know what? I got to the place where I was I had the victory." &gt;&gt; Well, if it if it's the same thing, then you know what? Don't be hindered by it. If you see somebody else enjoying what God has done for them, then you know what? Don't hold back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the devil's going to try to hold you back. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. I wouldn't do that. Well, who's talking to you? Well, some, you know, you come to church and because you know what? If you if you was at a ball game, talking about the ball game again, but you know what? If you was at a ball game, you wouldn't sit there and just look No, you know why people get up and they show their emotions. &gt;&gt; You know, they got their hands in the air. They're having a good time. &gt;&gt; And you know what? And they don't care what the next person is doing or anybody else doing because you know what? They come to have a good time. And you know what? They're going they're going to express what they believe and what what they're enjoying because you know what? They're in this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? If you got in the atmosphere, too, you know, then, you know, &gt;&gt; you know, because, you know, I I just I just hate and I and I'm sorry, it's just just part of my personality. Just that human grab bag I got. But, you know, it's sad when you have to come to church and you got to tell everybody, "Clap your hands, raise your hands, do this, do that." you know, if you come to worship God, you know, um, well, you know, I have a hard time seeing people worship the Lord and it's look like look like they're mimicking a totem pole. I mean, I don't I I honestly I honestly I I I've been to I've been to churches and honestly I've been to churches and you know I mean I mean they have you know and it's like people people worship for 30 minutes and they never clap their hands. They never raise their hands. They never snap their fingers. They never tap their foot. It's like, well, you know what that I mean? I don't know. The Psalmist David said, "Clap your hands. We're going to raise our hands. Lift up holy hands. We're going to sing. Praise the Lord in the dance." That's all right. I don't mind. But you know it's it's it's I think it's pray you know to praise God however you but you know if if if some because life life moves &gt;&gt; you know when brother saw that lady out there dancing that young girl and he said God he said he said before I know it he said I was out there on the floor dancing around with that girl and then I said God take me out of the seat of the scornful. Let me look at anything sensibly before I ever pass judgment anymore. &gt;&gt; Let me let me look at it sensibly. And you know what? If if God give us the victory, then you know what? We don't mind sharing the victory. Brother Wade, when you when you played football or baseball and everything, when y'all when y'all won games, really tough game, went down in extra innings or whatever, and y'all had to really really press the battle. I mean, you really had to work for that victory. When y'all got done, y'all just walked back to the locker room. We'd had fun when you go. No, no. I mean I mean [clears throat] I I'll tell I'll I'll tell this story on me and Richard. We went to a Christian school years ago. We played basketball. He had two left feet. I had two right feet. They called me the They called me the round mounter rebound. And my other nickname was freight train. Freight train. We we were the dynamic duo. Uh I played offense and he played defense. He couldn't sometimes he couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. But let me tell you what, that boy would stick to stick to you like white on rice. He would pester you to no end. I mean, he he really stopped people from scoring, passing the ball. And I mean, he was he was right there on you. Y'all wouldn't believe it, but back when he was slim. Hey, listen. I ain't talk about him. He's my brother. I That boy right there could run like the wind. Don't ask him to do that today, but back then he could run like the wind. He get out of wind. That's right. But anyway, that boy could that boy he could play defense. But I tell you what, they give me the ball. I was I was Larry Bird, Cream Abdul Jabar, Michael Jordan. You give me the ball, I'm going. I And I listen, I I learned I learned one thing real fast. It's like if you leave your feet, you leave your feet trying to block me, I'm putting you in the wall because if you jump and you make contact with me, it's against you. And I would and I would plow people. I would I just speed up and I know I'm g and I'd make shots. I make layups and I'd hit people so hard they they just hit the wall, hit the mat behind the basketball. Boom. After you do that two or three times, you know what? They just give you room. And you know what? I was just like, "Hey, we play this game all night long. I just keep hitting you." After a while, they just they just quit. We just make points. But you know when you get done, you go through all that and you get up there. No, but you know when when you get done, you go through all that right there. You know, you're jumping up and down and you get out there and Yeah. You're happy. Say what now? Woo. Well, you know what? If you got the victory tonight, then you know what? If you know what God's done for you and God's delivered you and God's healed you and he's done all these things for you, when you've seen God do something, you know what? Then you can stand up and and stand up and praise God &gt;&gt; and not be ashamed of it &gt;&gt; to see what God's done for you. When you've been through hard battles and you've seen God deliver you, &gt;&gt; when when God when there was no way when when every report was negative &gt;&gt; and there how are you going to make it? Well, you know what? God came on the scene. God specializes in things thought impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you come up there and you know what? If nobody else gets up, well then you know what? If you get happy, then I ought to get happy, too. Because you know what? If God blesses you, then you know what? I ought to be blessed because God blessed you. &gt;&gt; Well, God, if God healed you, then you know what? Then I ought to be able to raise my hands and say, "Thank God that he's that he's healed my brothers and he's healed my sisters. He's delivered them." &gt;&gt; Whatever whatever that you have need of, God's done for you. Then you know what? I'm praise God. I enjoy that. Thank God to see what God's done for people &gt;&gt; because you know what? That gives other people encouragement to realize, you know, God's God's amongst us. What? Pay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you come if you come here tonight and you're and you're sick and you're afflicted, then you know what? The Holy Spirit is here tonight and you don't have to leave here the same way you come in the door &gt;&gt; because you're either going to leave worse or better than the way you came in. &gt;&gt; But if he came here tonight, then you know what? All you got to do is follow God's plan. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's program is here &gt;&gt; and all you got to do is walk in it. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? I'm a victor because he said I was a victor. Well, you know what? I'm g I'm gonna act like I'm I got the victory &gt;&gt; because he said I had it. &gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna stand up and I'm I'm gonna thank God because you know what? I have the victory. &gt;&gt; When you think, well, I don't know how things are going to work out. You know what? We got we got the problem solver. Whatever whatever you have a whatever question you got, Jesus is the answer. He's the answer. We've got the answer. &gt;&gt; And all we got to do is put him on the case and just like, Lord, I'm going to hand it over to you. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we get we get aggravated, we get worried, we get frustrated with stuff. We're trying to carry our own burdens. &gt;&gt; We're trying to figure out our own things. What a friend we have in Jesus. All our sins and griefs to bear. What a privilege it is to carry everything to God in prayer. Yes. You know what? I'm I'm walk in freedom. I'm gonna walk in the blessing that I can turn it over to you. Lord, I just give it to you. And Lord, just just help me get out of your way that you can work. and see if God don't do a blessing in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Let's all stand. Have the musicians come.
