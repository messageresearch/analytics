because in honor of the Resurrection I'm not one that preaches messages related to say a Easter message or or this message or that message you know I I just preach whatever the Lord gives me but I'd like for us to read there in Luke about the resurrection this morning because it is the the time that we take and consider to be the Easter the time of the resurrection and all like that and we

hope that it'll it'll do all right remember all of those that are away today if you know if you looked around you can see uh not as many empty seats as you would think but there's a whole lot of church over in Alabama having Services there with them and and all and we you know we appreciate that they got Wade called this morning said they were doing fine they got together yesterday and then they're having like a morning service and and they've just different things that are going on during that period because a lot of them just were taking vacations and then others are just going over to be there in the services so we pray that the Lord would give them a safe journey driving back home and taking care of everything all right remember that anybody any other announcements that I'm missing so remember these announcements all right let's just pray and we'll go right into the service father we thank you for your grace your love your understanding thank you for you and we thank you for this Easter morning time that we have that Lord we can come together in honor of the Resurrection res rection because father we do that every time we come to church it doesn't matter if it's Wednesdays or Fridays or Saturdays or Sundays or whatever day of the week it is we gather together in honor of your Resurrection because that's the main thing in our hearts and lives to think about that in you raising then we can raise because it's a great time and a great honor to celebrate this Resurrection time we love you and we thank you you and just have your way as I said bless those that will be traveling back today and all this next week from vacation and things and just be with each one and help each and every one of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen let's just read these six verses and we'll read it responsive okay so we'll read it responsive now to where you know I read the first you read the next down to the verse six okay now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came un the suppl bring the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus came two men stood by them in shin and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead together he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee and you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have we're still speaking from the point of of the uh Revelations 1 we'll bypass that this morning but we'll go to uh Matthew 16 I remember Brother Anderson today because he's in the back room running everything by himself he's the whole computer end is based on his shoulder this morning on that to get everything to go and thank God Josh is here to run the sound system and things through here so then that makes it all work out but you know we thank God for these that can do these things to where others can be able to view so let's go for our thought today let's go to Matthew 16 and just read our scripture from Matthew 16 and uh then we'll go to uh John and excuse excuse me go to Luke we go to Matthew 1 16 and then we'll go to Luke when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou John the Baptist see because he had signs like John and the different things you know some say Elias because he was a prophet form some say Jeremiah you know and all are one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am amen and Simon Peter said unto him Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God we'll just stop on verse 16 now we'll go to Luke because I want you to notice now this is the same writing all right but I want you to notice the thought because the Matthew says you know showing his part that Peter is saying that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God all right now meaning you are God Almighty in human flesh not two Gods to another God or anything like that you are the Christ we've been back in Genesis going for quite a while and coming down through the the creation and bringing out the Christ and the form now look what it says in verse uh 20 of the n9th chapter of Luke and he saith unto them because that's what he asked you know John the Baptist and Elias or others he said unto them but whom say ye that I am Peter answering said the Christ of God now that's not different that's two different men describing to the point of what this you know the thought was because it's the same writing it's the same point you know the same uh but one of them says that you're the Christ the son of the Living God the other says you're the Christ of God uh now we know the word Christ means the anointed one and you know we will not be getting into as much as you think on that this morning but I want you to think with me because we have kind of finished up the uh point that we were trying to bring uh never to end anything but trying to bring the point of the creation of mankind and bringing it down to even that uh we understand the things now of God coming into being because he's condescending offending see if you covered him and and dealt with the word Elohim you would deal with Elohim as being the only word back there they could use and that would be self-existing so there was a time God was self-existing see nobody dwelt with him he existed alone because that's the point of what it would be and see that's where your Trinity comes in well one created the other one and the other one that you know so you're getting into things that are not even sensible because how could one God create another God or how would he be a God if he is created well you say well that was just a great mystery of the Trinity it would be a great mystery you know how that they could be co- uh equal and co-eternal now that's your statement from your your nan Creeds and things co-equal and co-eternal how can you be co-eternal there's only one Eternal there there's no way to be anything co-eternal the only way we can have eternal life is to have his own life not the point of trying to say we are Eternal can't be it's his own life all right then showing that we believe in the one true and living God but we believe in the many manifestations of that God father son Holy Ghost his manifestations are not just changing his form from what was be in the time see then there was back in the Old Testament you would call him Jehovah the father see then when he was on Earth the Bible says God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself so it would come down to where that that same God would be dwelling in Flesh on the earth called a son now the same God is in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right that makes it sensible that but you can't can't do with do away with any of those things that's my point I've been trying to make about it that as God has revealing himself to mankind so as he starts descending toward us condescending is a better word to where that is coming down to where he can reveal hisself to you and I to mankind all right then in that we find that in in the creation he reveals himself uh you know if I had time I could go back we can go through all of the the first chapter of Genesis and take all of those things and show that those things are showing his glory his person and that's what we're talking about we still haven't got over in the Book of Revelations to that but showing what he is doing this is the revealing God of God it's not the revealing of me and you see we need to get that out of the way way it's revealing of God in you and I all right the new birth in you and I is the same God it created the world well you say but how can that be well if you can explain God you can you won't have no question about how could it be because do you believe he's capable of giving everybody in the world the baptism of the Holy Ghost if they'd accept it well how could he be divided among 7 billion people you can't expl explain those things it's unexplainable but to know and to realize each one of those persons has eternal life because that is what the new birth is all right now then seeing it back there we've seen the creation shows the Creator you remember that we've dwelt on that for quite a while that looking at the creation we can see the Creator I'm going to try to stay behind here today because Brother Anderson running both poles and he's got to run over if I run over and go back so I'll try to hold on to here okay all right I gener walk right there anyway but we won't try to do that today as much all right now we've seen the creation of man brings forth the understanding of the great Eternal God because even back before the foundation of the world according to Genesis 1 126 and 27 when he said he made man in his own image see then he made that man there in His image which was not another person but was himself made manifest in another form all right and that man that was created was God himself not the image of God like a person over here and this over here looks like it that's not the word in the Bible terminologies the word image in the the Bible terminologies means the exact same person or likeness or the being all right just to give a quick run through to come on to where I point for the day all right he took that man that he had created because he created the world he created the animals you know the the the world and all of the trees and the thing then he created the animals and brought them all into being but then the last thing that was created or part that was created was man in a physical form fleshly man and we read there in Genesis that he formed him out of the Dust of the earth he breathed into his nostrils he became a living Soul he placed him in read Genesis account placed him in the garden to rule over the animals as number one part because he had that part in him he even named the animals what a great person Adam was but yet then in that he was still a human being made right and then God took a rib from that man because he he saw him lonely he took a rib from that man and he made a body and he placed within that the you know the soul the spirit and made Eve all right making Adam and Eve as to be the the point in the garden that you know that they were together as one all right and in doing that he made her to be with him to where the the Bible didn't call her Eve it called her woman all right because Eve was the name that was given later when it says she become the mother of all living that's what the word eve come up for she didn't have that name to start with she she was a woman cuz she was taken from man all right beautiful situation wonderful part as to be in the garden as they could fellowship and do and and be with the animals and God would come down in the cool of the day as we'd say it and he would fellowship with them and at night the prophet said he would even put them to sleep and lay them down and and and would let them rest and and things not that they had to do but the point that they were mortal in flesh all right the tree of life was in the garden to remind them their youth was being renewed but their their bodies were not Eternal because they were a creation and you don't create something Eternal that that won't work all right but see then taking that Adam and letting him be there and putting Eve with him to where that Adam and Eve would both be there in the garden and they would be together and have a wonderful time in the soul of Adam and Eve we've covered this is taken from Blasphemous names where he talks about uh the prophet speaks of breathing into the nostrils of Adam and he became especially into Adam an eternal person with God gave him eternal life in his soul all right then Eve brother Bron speaking on why some people can't keep the victory he says that the blushing part of Eve you know the very blushing of eternal life made her beautiful see then Adam and Eve in their soul had eternal life right all right but now their body their Spirit was brought into being it was not Eternal all right then then we went through that uh Eve then as she began to listen to the the Beast that the Bible speaks of in Genesis about three there where it says the the serpent was the most subtle of all Beast well uh a beast and a serpent is two different things he was a beast was an upright creature even scofi in your Bible says that that don't relate it to a snake he said it was made that by the curse upon the Beast because that way the Beast would have been the link between man and the monkey that Darwin could not find he could find a a connecting link on all the animals and you can't argue with him about it because they were connections because we believe not in evolution we believe in Creative Evolution God created one animal and then he created a higher form right then he created a higher form within the life form that in his creation was mankind all right then placing that as we said that it was the part of his own being placing that into Adam and giving him eternal life placing it into Eve giving her eternal life but yet their body and their Spirit was not Eternal all right then we covered how that that Eve and her reasoning and as Paul says in the Corinthians that lest Satan tempt you you know and do as he did to Eve through the subtility the smartness the shrewdness of that Beast because the Beast was an upright creature remember the story Serpent and beast that's two different species of animals all right but he was a beast he was upright he could talk all right then the curse made him crawl up on the ground as a SN as a snake as we call it a serpent all right and then see you see no more from Genesis as we were talking about last night a little bit in the Bible study you don't see no more of that Beast because it's cursed and put into the snake form all right because it said upon the the dust thou shall eat the things and crawl upon your belly all right but isn't it odd that when you get to the Book of Revelations which I don't think it's odd I think it's a wonderful point that you started out with this Beast that Satan was using to do his things whatever you want to talk about and whatever you want to talk about what the the sin was if you want to talk about it an apple just remember the Beast was there to hand out the apples all right so if you want to be that part about it well I believe it was an apple that there eaten well if you want to be that way go ahead but just remember the Beast was there to give out the apples okay so you got the Beast formed there so just leave him what he is but isn't it odd over in the Book of Revelations that it returns back to the Beast read the book of Revelations it returns back to the Beast all right then we're not dealing with down through time as anything in the form of the Beast seed you're dealing with what the Bible says in Genesis 3:15 speaking to the serpent speaking to the snake that was made to the Earth I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman all right what is the seed of the serpent unbelief no matter what religious form you are and what you believe it happened in the garden you still have to contend with the point that it was unbelief that caused all of the problems because that's the the problem today is still unbelief all right now just getting a little background part to where we come up through and Wednesday I don't know whether you enjoyed it but I did I I love to read the Bible and just look at it Page by page I I'm thoroughly enjoying the uh Bible study because we just started in Romans uh back I don't know nearly a year ago I guess and we're over to the eth chapter in Romans so it took us quite a while to to get over that far at least 6 months that we've been been doing that and just take a scripture and read it and you see what that scripture says read it for yourself don't don't say well we believe this because they taught us it read it till we was in Romans 81 you know where there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and then you stop and if Paul hadn't to put the next words to it see you'd have said okay then they're in Christ Jesus it don't matter what I do I'm all right Paul put it in and it's called interpolating as the big words they use for it but it simply means he was making sure things were not going to get misunderstood so Paul was saying there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus what who walk after the flesh you know after the spirit and not after the flesh see he put his understanding there to where that it would would help us and that's the way that I like to read it and that's what we done Wednesday we just went through from one verse to the next verse of Genesis reading it see once you see what you're talking about once you get away from what you've been taught to the point of reading it then you read it and there's no problem with reading where it says the serpent was a the most subal of all beasts then you're not in Mass confusion of say a beast is one thing the Serpent's another thing one's a snake the other's upright what is they talking about see now you understand he was made a snake right that's why they can't find it don't you think now come on let's be human sensible don't you think that that mankind knows there's a connecting link between all the animals and don't you tell me they ain't tried to implant seeds of the monkey into the woman and the and the man into the monkey now don't tell me you're dumb science is a way ahead of you on those things they've been doing that a long time trying to get something to make sure that they they can make a connection because they can make a connection with everything else but that specie in the middle was totally destroyed it was so put till it was it didn't just go back to the monkey looked like it would have went from you know the Beast back to the monkey stage cuz that was the closest no it was placed so far back into the to the chain of creation until science cannot follow it but don't you tell me they ain't tried to mix a snake and a woman together I'm too old I'm 74 I'll be 75 pretty quick just don't tell me them stories I'm I'm beyond childhood I I know what they do in science they've done everything in the book that's how they wound up with a mule right a mule is not in the chain of cre ation right a m is a mixture between a an ass and a female horse all right a Marica brought it about and you got all kind of doings in that line that they've done God made the mule as brother B said I mean made the horse and the ass and man put them together and got a mule but they can't go no further that's right because it won't reprod produce itself all right but now are you following me but see because of that unbelief that was in Eve through her being what we call the the spirit form of her which is your body your C taste feel smelling here that's your contact to world with that all right your next real is Spirit real which is memory reason conscience affection go get your book and just read the biology I guess is that right is the biology about human body and that thing you know I'm done out of school a long time ago I didn't go very much anyway but and you can tell that but but see in that Spirit realm of memory reason conscious affection that's where Satan begin to deal with her and caused the wrong whatever you want to call it the eating of the apple or whatever you want to talk about it was caused by that being of that part of Eve well that's where Satan is still working today is through our men memory reason conscious affections and things he's working in that realm all right but then inside of man is the soul which is either born again or not born again right so it's either Faith or it's doubt is one or the other that controls us through the soul part of us and the soul is the real you right that's right because remember it doesn't say the spirit that sth or the body that sinth it says the soul that sth shall die so the soul is more real than the body and the spirit but Satan could not enter into Eve's soul but he could enter through her spirit being and showing her hey you have the motherly Instinct look at the animals they're reproducing as we were talking last night they're reproducing because you tell me they wouldn't reproducing in the garden I want to ask you one question I like to put it this way where you don't have anything to argue about out okay if you don't think they was reproducing in the garden what about the two animals that God took there the animal that God took the skin you lost your species right and God didn't create but one male and one female animal he didn't create a flock of chickens and and one old rooster that we want to look at he created one male and one female all right but see they were reproducing in the garden because there's nothing wrong with the reproduction of the animal form you say well I don't like that idea well that's all right you tell me some other way but you tell me something sensible because I just told you because we know the Bible says God took the Skins right well either he created some animals to take the skins off of which would be contrary to him because he'd already made them or he took the animals that were reproducing in the garden that's right all right so then the the serpent was smart The Devil Is What You signify with the word serpent is Satan the Bible says that old serpent me all right and he was telling Eve about the things of life through her memory reason cons and as he did he be coming into possession of the body as I keep saying cuz that's up to you you if you say it was an apple it had eaten well then it still got through the reasoning memory conscience and affections but I never did know of apples causing any problem except a belly ache you can do all you want to but that's true but anybody 20 years old got some sense and like I told you before my daddy told my mother way back he didn't know anything about the Bible he couldn't even read but she read him in Genesis one day and he told her what happened because he's 45 years old before he got married you understand what I mean he was already well knowing and he told her what happened in the garden that didn't make him a prophet that made him with plain sense once you can get away from reading now if you read in the newspaper that there was a man and a woman and a something else over here and this got all messed up over here and you was reading in the newspaper you'd say we know what happened we know what happened but you read it in the Bible you try to be so spiritual oh yeah okay get off your spiritual get out of Common Sense sometime and just read it the Bible say he said that he begal me defiled me all right but see then when it was brought forth that brought death upon the human race right whatever you want to call it and it brought death upon the human race all right then there was Adam and Eve and what are you going to do with them there was Adam and Eve with eternal life in their soul and the prophet gets into the to the the breach in the which is paragraph 91-93 I didn't give them these to do they're on the computer where other people can read them all right that man lost the claims of life eternal life and fell to death now in that falling to death did Adam fall from eternal life to death how can you do that so the prophet's not saying what we're thinking he's saying even though we got the words because he says you can't follow from eternal life he said if you ever have eternal life you can't lose it well right now he's meaning something different right right that's what we tried so much to get to you to think about so in the garden it throwed mankind into death and Adam and Eve died right right they were not supposed to die before then because the tree of life was there to reminded that their youth was being renewed but because of the Fall they died all right it doesn't mean they died and went to hell go remember if you take eternal life back away from a person you got an ending Giver out of God and that doesn't work I know I discussed this with people and and a person told me he said well that was back di before the New Birth come and they was capable of falling I said don't be an Indian giver God's not an inding Giver if he gave adam an eve eternal life he didn't take it back right it was just to point to the prophet explaining that they died where they was not going to die but they didn't die to the point they're lost all right see if they died to the point they're lost then you got trouble let's see what I wrote down see if I can find my own notes you know they could not fall to hell because the death they died of took about 3 or 400 years right the physical death upon Adam and Eve and I didn't look up to see how many years they live but they lived way on over you know good many hundred years but it was the death on the point of not Eternal separation but it was a physical death that was put upon Mankind and everything after then would be born dead right CU that's what the Bible says about it says you're born dead see Adam and Eve lived a long time now here's what you're going to have to listen we think they went to or you could say they went to an eternal separation well I would like for you to explain that to me well they were put out of the garden oh okay they were put out the garden but I thought God dwelt with Adam and Eve on down through life that's right I thought he was with them from then on because the sacrifices were made the atonement was there and by the atonement being there he could fellowship with Adam and Eve so they never fell to an eternal separation they fell to Natural death and that brought all mankind then that would be born into the world would be born in Satan's domain and would be the point that it would be we're dead right you and I are born dead I don't care how much you think you're alive I'm 74 but I ain't 74 I'm only what God has given me of eternal life cuz that's 74 years don't Mount to nothing are you following what I'm saying see their soul was eternal Adam and Eve Soul was eternal but their body and their Spirit was not Eternal so when death came on man it fell upon his body Spirit form in Adam and Eve but then the next person that was born God didn't give them eternal life right CU you better be careful about about that cuz remember there was a Cain and an Abel you might think about your lineage of Abel but you don't want to think about your lineage of Cain right at least you know that much about the Bible see I like to talk that way because that way you can go home and sensibly think something over all right because if if mankind after then received eternal life then you'd have Cain with eternal life no the next person that came in which was Cain and Abel both of them was lost right Abel needed a sacrifice this as well as oh wait a minute no we got this lineage this lineage come down to Abel and it come down to here and it uhoh we got a problem because Abel never had any lineage right right able didn't have no children so you just ended your Doctrine and don't realize it he said brother Dale you're just this that no well be what you want to you tell me cuz you're going to have to jump over able and at least hit to Seth if you're going to start a lineage cuz nothing was carried on in able all right oh it's spiritual okay do what you want to but listen the Covenant was already made with Adam and Eve before the foundation of the world because the Bible says Jesus Christ stood as a lamb before the foundation of the world that's why Adam and Eve that's why Eve was not destroyed immediately when she done something wrong that's right amen for one second in the point of sin and Eve would have been annihilated but the atonement have already been made all right so Adam and Eve wasn't cast out of the garden to a to a separation even in Cain that the Bible says went out from the presence of the Lord but remember before he went out and done what he done God told Cain said you would have been received had you done like Abel now go offer like Abel and it'll be all right and he says I ain't going to do it quoting brother randam he said Cain said I've done what I've done and I do and I'm not going to do anything else cuz remember Eve thought she was right you know what Cain thought he was right it was revealed unto Abel because on the rest of the reading in the in the the Matthew reading on Tru what does it say th AR the Christ the son of the Living God he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church this Revelation and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it all right see because it can't stop it because it's Eternal all right now but the point for the day of what we want to get at well let me bring these parts because it do it see in the Bible there in Genesis 3:15 he said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman all right if the seed of the serpent was Satan in his seed of unbelief then it was the promise of the coming of the Messiah because that's what happened at Calvary because if you read it says he'll bruise your head this will bruise your heel so at Calvary that's what took place this Resurrection we talk about of this day come to pass because of the the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ who died for our sins not his own all right and see putting him into the to the point that actually went to hell for you and I because he descended to the to be a witness right is that the scripture right all right then when it does see the promise of the Messiah was there in the garden and I love the way the prophet brought it because you read it and you don't place things in the correct order he said as they were going out of the garden with the Skins flopping upon them of the animals that he had killed for them to make the atoma said he saw them and he realized that the love in his heart could not let the mankind leave how great wonderful would it is it the statements the man would make he said he wasn't going to let him go out said he stopped him and said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman right he said promising that one day the Messiah would come and look where the Messiah would have to come from if you think it was eating apples why didn't he fall off an apple tree right if you think he was eating fruit why didn't he fall off some fruit where did he come from it was necessary that the Messiah come through the wound of a woman that's right right because remember the curse that was put on Eve because of what she done since you he'll multiply your childbearing he'll multiply your sorrows and your desire shall be to your husband and he shall rule over thee but to Adam it didn't put that part it put to Adam that cursed is the earth cuz you're going to make your living you're going to work for a living right all right now so then as following that point think about it the promise of the coming Messiah all right the Christ you remember when we had to drawing up and I told you to make sure you use the word Christ as we were talking about what was over here before and then what came into being or has come into being now in our lives as a manifestation of God all right watching that then if you and I will think about it we can look down through the Bible and see a marvelous situation taking place and I love it the way the prophet said it on Christ the Myster of God reveal he said if you read the Bible you can pull that up brother Anderson if you want to he said if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse now I love that he said go back and read it again see he said c you missed something see the Christ all right in every verse he's the principal thing roll it on up watch what he's a principal theme of the entire Bible if you read the Bible now how wonderful we don't praise the man we praise God who brought the message to the man the man was a man just like you and I if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every reverse go back and read it again now he didn't say because it would be impossible to read the Bible to see Jesus in every verse so he didn't say that he said you see the Christ in every verse CU Jesus the human flesh was not in the Old Testament you can't use it even in the mzd right because that was just a body spoken into existence and out of existence but see the Christ can you think about the Bible and see the Christ as he would come down can you think about Christ as being the angel of the Covenant the Christ the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel was the Christ you agree the Christ and see that Christ down through the Bible as it will unfold and see him as he the great things that takes place in the Bible of that Christ do you think it was David that killed Goliath uh he told the rock but it had to be the Christ right look back in those and read Christ Myster of God revealed if you will and look at the way the prophet describes it that Christ can be seen in every verse of the Bible if you read it you can see how that those prophets they were the Christ to the people you think about it we'll get more in this afternoon into something to help us a little more understand but look at David look at David and as I said the Christ that would appear there but look at David there's more to the story than just the anointing because David had URI killed and took his wife but remember the story when the Prophet Nathan came to him and said gave him the story about this and one sheep over here and a whole bunch over here he went over and took the one sheep and and David brought his own condemnation he said bring the man here in other words I'll kill him he said let that man die I'll kill him in other words Nathan looked at him and said David Thou Art the man but what did he go on and say he said but David you won't die that's right you won't die he was due to he was supposed to in all righteousness and every form he had brought his own condemnation down upon himself and David knew that don't you think the rest of that man's life he could remember how that he stood in one Split Second he could have been totally annihilated for what he done and would have to call his own judgment as to be righteous of God who was it in all of those Prophets The Christ that's right all right remember what it said was we read dark the Christ the son of the Living God you realize that Peter was saying you are the god of the word because that's what Christ is and all of those Prophets phets spoke of Christ all of those prophets in their actions and their reactions and things look at Moses standing at a burning bush and talking to the one that said I am that I am now Moses you go on down and tell them and said when they want to know who's going to lead them out said tell them I am well that got pretty personal with Moses did it sir come on that King down in in Egypt had a little sense too he knowed better to think that Moses could do any of those things but he knew that he was bringing something that he couldn't deal with he found out real quick right you had never thought about why didn't that King just take out there and say go kill him my goodness Moses walk up there you know let my people go he said go kill him well who's going to keep from he got no Army he got nobody to fight with but that King was afraid because the man he had run into the Wilderness and gave him enough water to be able to survive a day or two had made it and lived through it and 40 years later he's walking back standing in front of him and remember Moses that at one time was the head of the army that King was afraid of him but he was really afraid of the fact that something did happen to bring the man back do you see Christ in ever verse of the Bible can you see it in the prophets as they were the way they were doing can you see Joshua as he would take the people across and divide out the land to the people and the things that he was doing can you see Samson in the bases that there he was yeah scrandle of dirty rascal mhm but yet the Christ was there in Samson that he wasn't afraid of nothing that's right because that Christ being there look at all those Old Testament people as they live their lives out and you see Christ Christ leading them look at Abraham and the Covenant that was made and the things that were told of Abraham Abraham met God many different times spoke to him as the form that he was called MDC see he could see the Christ David as we say had already because of the Prophet Nathan had come to him and said you'll be King David when wasn't afraid of no Goliath he wasn't afraid of nothing till he become king he might thought that over in his life and said I don't know what I'll do when I get on the throne but until I get there ain't nothing going to hurt me right cuz I'm under the Christ right Christ is the Angel of the Covenant it says in the book of Acts that he spoke to Moses from the burning bush he led the children of Israel as the pillar of fire and the cloud he was the Christ the son of the Living God then here's a man to introduce him you can see that it had to be a revelation to Peter because he couldn't get it straight to start with and even after seeing the revelation of who Christ was he still denied him yes cuz he was a human being right but when that anointing struck him he said you are the Christ the son of the Living God pull it on over into Luke which Luke is more uh specific look more uh bringing it into a wonderful I love the Book of Luke not that the others are not right they're all right this is the same story but Luke is something because uh you know he even says in his start off when he's reading and Luke was not with the Lord Jesus when he was walking on Earth all right but Luke said having perfect understanding and none of the others said that Matthew Mark John they didn't say it that way Luke is more specific in a detail so when he brought his point out there in Luke he said Thou Art the Christ of God that's the title of the message going into what we using the Christ of God in other words you I don't understand understand it I can't figure it out but something revealed to me is that what Peter was saying that you are the Christ of God all right now the Christ then would be the Creator and that's why you find in John one that declares him to be the Creator who the Christ not the man Jesus the flesh you find it in Hebrews you find it in Colossians all in the first chapter read it and then you find him especially in J is it Ephesians 3:9 where it said all things were created by Jesus Christ and without him there was not anything created Jesus the flesh wasn't back there as a Creator that's right come on Jesus the Christ had to be a a part of the creation he had to be created or brought into being right right cuz the Bible said Hebrews 105 a body thou Hast prepared me all right yes so we can see the Christ then as it's all the way through the scripture we can see him all the way through and seem coming into the Flesh in that body that was dwelling on Earth that we call Jesus we can see the Christ that's right they didn't dare fool with Jesus until God allowed it to happen right that's right not making trinitarianism out of it no they just couldn't take him before his time and you know the fact that we read the resurrection you know the Bible was saved really the resurrection he was barred out of Resurrection until the scripture was fulfilled even though he was the god of the word right come on even though he was the creator himself he could not come forth in the resurrection until the scriptures were fulfilled that's what the Bible says right so he was barred out as we used he was kept from coming forth until the three days was completed then he could raise and who was he then the Christ who is this one that raised on the Easter morning let me quote the scripture if the spirit that was in him be in you right if the spirit that was in him be in you it'll Quicken your mortal body because it was the spirit inside of him that raised him up right right and that's where it's got to be in you and I but are you following me see God had a plan and a purpose according to Christ of mystory of what we were reading a while ago a plan and a purpose to let him be known or seen and and to follow it through the word we can see the Christ from the beginning we can see him make itself manifest in many forms throughout the Bible the Old Testament coming forth then we can see that Christ as in a man that was walking on the shores of Galilee then we can see that Christ as the anointing right because that's what Christ means the anointed or anointed one and we can see the day of Pentecost when the baptism of the Holy Ghost come into Mankind and you know what you and I become little Christ little Messiah right offspring of God as Paul was talking in the book of Acts and to see that Christ as it could come down and to see that it was promised in the end time to come upon a bride to bring her to a position to change these vile bodies the Christ that's right the son of the Living God now how did we talk about it in Genesis that God began to reveal himself and use great words of theophany logos but see we look at it to try to figure out the Son of God and remember the Son of God was the creator the Christ that's right the son of the Living God was a creator thank you Jesus all right see then why do we have trouble with trying to understand we just simply go back and listen we just read the word so if you have any problem trying to figure out who the Creator is let's go back and read your Bible John 1 plainly says Jesus was a Creator Hebrews 1 plainly says it Colossians 1 about 14 15 right on do a little bit brings it in James clarifies it by saying Jesus Christ the son of the Living God the Christ the Christ Thou Art the Christ see then you can follow Christ Through the Bible and you can see him as he appears in many ways you can see him in the fiery furnace with Shadrach mesach and in bigo we throwed three in didn't we wasn't that what the king said and he said there's four down there now and he said that fourth man is like unto the who Son of God there was the Christ that could come down and dwell with him he could be with Samson Solomon David Joshua remember Joshua he's he's there one day walking around he looks over and there understands a man well Joshua was a fighter he grabs his sword and he heads ice cream because he want to know he said are you for us or for the enemy if you're for us it's okay but if you're for the enemy we're going to have a fight he said I am not neither one paraphrasing in simple language he said I'm the God of all things and I've come down to take over Joshua fall on his knees in front of him cuz he knows who that is the Christ who did all of those prophets see and and try to follow after the Christ right the Christ he came down in human flesh because here was John John 1:29 I believe it is where John the Baptist introduced him he said the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world Peter sees him in a higher form Matthew writes of that because Matthew wrote 16 we read you know talking about Peter the AR the Christ the son of the Living God Luke just sees it in a little higher form in his understanding and sees the same thing but he calls him the Christ the son of the Living God the Christ of God that's right that anointing has been all the way down to there you can follow it all the way through see it's Christ being revealed in the Bible right as we read it you say well what was in those people back there that made them do this that and the other the Christ the Christ he was the one who led the children of Israel he was in Ezekiel where it speaks of a wheel in the middle of the wheel and we realize that wheel in the middle of the wheel is Jesus Christ coming forth into mankind you know that's right and we see the children of Israel as that that's them as they travel because remember the wheels went and the the fire chariots and the things cared that was Israel in their Journey but who was it taking care of them he said don't you worry about it who was it there at the mber tree go ahead don't worry about it who did he say over to burning bush go ahead don't worry about it cuz my angel is going to go before you and he'll take care of everything you know the safest place to be in in the days when the three children were cast in the fiery furnace was in the fiery furnace right even though it killed everybody that throw them in right read your Bible right that was the safest place in the world to be Daniel in the lines Den safest place that Daniel could be you think anybody's going to bother him when did a whole bunch of lines down in there he ain't nobody going to come down there and harm him right but the Christ was there who was it that opened the doors as Peter was in prison and all at once he's outside the prison and he looks back and he says oh I must be dreaming but if I am still how did I get out here and if I'm out here I might as well just go on home he walks home he knocks on the door you remember the girl opened the door she slammed it back probably in his face went running through the house you know said Peter spirit is out there you know cuz she didn't believe it right you know if she didn't believe it he'd got out of prison she said it's his Spirit she's scared to death but you see how would you like to be the governor or the ruler of a prison and you got outer Court outer guards inner guards all kind of guards that's going through there and each one of those guards if a prisoner got out he lost his life right that was the law he lost his life how would you like to be when you see a man standing outside over there that you was guarding over him you remember if you don't believe the story is right who was it which one was it Peter or Paul or one that was in in there you know and he said don't don't harm yourself the guy was fixing to kill himself cuz that's the best thing to do cuz it was a horrible death for them to kill him he was fixing to kill himself he said don't don't do that he said we're all still here well no wonder the guy wanted converted no wonder he wanted to go on with him because of all the things that had happened you see what I'm talking about what is it is leading the church today the Christ the son of the Living God who are we if we are The Offspring of God we are the Christ of God why because the anointing is what makes us to Christ the anointing the Christ what do you think about it you said well brother Dale you know we we need to know a little bit about the Easter of the Resurrection that's what I'm talking about because after the resurrection you remember he raised you remember what he said when he was are in the the writing and Mary comes up to him and he says all right you go tell Peter then that I risen from the dead and said I'll go before you but right before then he told her a secret thing that was great that'll tie of this afternoon's message he said I go to your God watch it and my God that's right that's not trinitarianism he said I go to your father and my father you get over in the Book of Romans where we just got through a reading and it talks about how that the children of God are co-equal with God I can you be coequal with God you can't be but if he makes us that then why do we argue back what he's made us that's right who is it today supposed to be doing all of the things who is it supposed to be speaking to you today but do you take it that way as to be the Christ the son of the Living God if you don't take it that way you then you need to go home and stay at home this afternoon CU you you don't believe you're going to get anything anyway unless you can believe that Christ can come down through somebody and speak well then it's not the person anyway it's the Christ can I read you want me to where brother R said that same Christ is here today do you need them they're here in the notes the same Christ is here today now brother brandham is gone well that's your Christ no oh my thank you Father the Christ he's still here amen amen who's going to raise the dead in the last days the Christ right and then we give all honor and glory to the Christ but now I'm going to make one statement and I'm not going to clarify it I'm just going to make that statement you can have the Christ on you every day of your life and die and go to hell hell do you need those quotes do you realize it was the cfus that was said it he said it was necessary that one should die for the sins of the people you know what he was doing by being high priest he was under the anointing of the Christ that went with the high priest and he prophesied of the death of Jesus Christ turned around and killed him but by being the anointing part it was there all right see then there must be something else to the story if you can out the Christ the genuine baptism with the Holy Spirit on your spirit that's right every day of your life and die and go to hell I believe that right so there must be more to the story amen there is than just the Christ okay as Paul Harvey says that's page one we'll get to page two this afternoon and talk about is he says the rest of the story right you remember that when he was on but think about it what do you think about the Christ what do you think about the Christ come on Brothers what do you think about the Christ if you were asked to introduce Jesus what would you introduce him as you would have to first introduce him as the Christ because you can't introduce him as the Jesus of back that's a Oneness Doctrine you can't introduce him as the Jesus of the Old Testament because it's not the Jesus of the Old Testament but you can introduce him as the Christ the son of the Living God what do you think about him let's stand together what do we got brother 482 482 in the spirro book anybody have a need the altar is open come and let's see if that Christ still lives come and let's see if he still lives I'm learning to lean on Jes come let's see if he live that I'm learning to Jes learning to Le yes I'm learning to Le I'm learning to lean on Jesus mighty more power i' Dre I to on Jes sad broken hearted at an altar in pray I found peace that is so and all his eyesight's giving him problems over many years now Lord and failing away constantly Satan is pounded upon this body in all forms and old cods and sinuses and drainages and all kind of things trying to beat him down the Lord we just TI not today in the end of the Rope we come down as far as we can go because there's nothing we can do we go to the doctors we thank God for them we do what they say thank you Lord for giving them to us but we just tie that knot in thy word that says by your stripes we are healed and may we go forth confessing that word and no matter how worse it gets We Believe believe that we're healed in Jesus name thank you Lord anybody else see when you get to the end of your rope here the right place the old saying said you get to the end of your road to TI not hold on that's a good saying you ever been down so low and so beat down until you just didn't couldn't be able to see further on but just hang on and just keep saying by his stripes I'm Healed her little sister's come for her mommy she's got some hurting in her body and these things that they've done and all we just ask you Lord to reach down and touch her and let everything be all right because we believe you father in Jesus name anybody else just have a need remember that Christ that's the one we're talking about that one that's leading us and guiding us the Christ what is our Revelation Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God who is he to you today and he says who is this son of man that's what was there in the scripture we read you know he said they aren't the Christ he might not have caught the whole story when you talking about son of man but he caught enough of it to hang on and build a church Church wasn't built on the day of Pentecost on son of man it was built on Christ amen the son of the Living God but in the end time it's going to finish upon the son of man and who will that son of man be now quote brother Brandon who is the son of man he said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God that's only it's riseing the son I think the Christ what do you think about him see why we honor the resurrection because look what all of the Resurrection has brought to pass into our hearts and our lives Lord Jesus we thank you thank you for raising thank you for dying first for me and then raising for my justification and to lead us on into Thy word that we may walk in the light of Your Love thank you for the Christ the anointing that truly we love and we cherish but we know there's more to the story than just to be anointed because we could just we could be a false anointed we could be ones that would be even trying but be anointed just upon our spirit but we want more than that Lord L have your way with us as we go to eat a natural meal and then be with all and be with those traveling back and oh away thems coming back lord this afternoon as said I know for them and some of the others maybe and we pray that you would just bless as they travel and Lord just let your love and grace be with each one keep us in Jesus name amen you dismiss never me again my I'll see you in the I see you I see my let me
