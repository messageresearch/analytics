[13:39] you follow what we're talking about and
[13:41] everything and you know and then we'll
[13:43] try to move on with the thought all
[13:45] right so it was good I see
[13:47] remember the Valentine banquet and
[13:50] February keep that in mind remember I
[13:54] was thinking it was this week but I
[13:55] think it's week from Monday or something

[14:26] right into the word father we thank you
[14:28] for your grace in your love and to us
[14:30] Lord we thank you for you and we ask you
[14:33] to just bless each one of us Father in
[14:36] understanding because that's what we
[14:38] desire more than anything open our eyes
[14:40] to that word Lord we sing it unto the
[14:43] ever service and Lord we believe that
[14:46] the the fact that in the times of the
[14:48] Bible that they sent two singers first
[14:51] so Lord we've sung about you of open her
[14:54] eyes she'll now come on the scene and
[14:57] fill our hearts with your loving grace

[15:08] that are sick we pray that you would
[15:10] just got each one we love you and we
[15:13] thank you in Jesus name Amen
[15:19] 1st Peter 1 we'll start reading let's
[15:27] just go ahead in verse about 13 to save
[15:31] reading you know so much time we read
[15:32] this over and over and over and how it's
[15:34] coming down to to how that everything
[15:37] spoke of this day all the prophets and
[15:41] their lives the things they've done
[15:42] spoke of this day alright and then when
[15:46] it is this word for gird up the loins of
[15:48] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[15:51] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[15:54] you at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:59] okay now let's go over to revelations 1
[16:08] verse 12 verse 11 John is told 11 and
[16:13] I'll told to write what he sees and send
[16:16] it to the churches and all name in each
[16:18] one and then after this voice had told
[16:22] him all of these things see
[16:24] then we start our point and I turned to
[16:27] see the voice that spake with me and
[16:29] being turned I saw seven golden
[16:31] candlesticks and the midst of the seven
[16:34] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[16:36] Man clothed with a garment down to the
[16:38] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[16:40] golden girdle and he's hid in his hair
[16:42] was white like wool as white as snow and
[16:45] his eyes were as a flame of fire and his
[16:48] feet like unto fine brass as if they
[16:51] burned in a furnace and his voice is the
[16:53] sound of many waters and he had in his
[16:56] right hand seven stars and out of his
[16:58] mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and
[17:00] his countenance was as the Sun Shine
[17:04] ahthe in his strength
[17:05] now he's describing this one that's
[17:09] being seen then look what happens and
[17:12] when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[17:14] dead he laid his right hand on me saying
[17:17] unto me fear not I am the first and the
[17:20] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[17:24] and behold I am Alive for evermore amen
[17:26] and have the keys of hell and death the
[17:30] prophets said this is not even a prophet
[17:34] this is Almighty God speaking here in
[17:38] the scripture so you may be seated the
[17:40] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[17:42] the word no I've spent quite a time on
[17:51] trying to get us to see the background
[17:58] or the layout you know laying things
[18:02] down getting it in order to understand
[18:05] the writing of the Bible number one and
[18:08] how that that Bible is still being
[18:13] manifested because it's unveiling its
[18:17] opening up and really it's being written
[18:22] you know it's already been paying I
[18:24] don't misunderstand my statements that's
[18:27] why I review a lot and recap like what I
[18:30] say because I don't want you to
[18:32] misunderstand my point you know God's
[18:36] not riding down the Bible was written
[18:38] the world alright that's in God come
[18:42] down to mankind and then it was started
[18:46] to be pinned and coming down and John he
[18:50] pins the life's part to bring it to us
[18:54] of the book of Revelation alright so
[18:57] then in doing that as I've tried to
[19:00] cover it because I want to point in your
[19:02] mind definite to think on that the Bible
[19:06] is a wonderful book because it shows the
[19:07] past the present and the future right
[19:13] now but listen to what I'm saying God
[19:18] doesn't live in the past he does not
[19:24] live in the future he lives in the
[19:28] present tense because that's what he
[19:30] told Moses at the bush when he said who
[19:32] do I tell him sent me he said tell him I
[19:35] am that I am I am means ever-present
[19:41] right for eternity ever-present there is
[19:47] no future in God now he knows the future
[19:50] his omniscience and all of the
[19:53] understanding knows those things but
[19:56] he's not there that's the one thing that
[19:59] really thrilled my soul to read when the
[20:02] Prophet I begin to read this message and
[20:04] then one day said it like this he said
[20:06] even though man sinned and there in the
[20:10] garden he said God just come right down
[20:13] to live with man and there's never been
[20:17] a time since he descended there in the
[20:21] garden that he was never here present
[20:24] with the believers all right
[20:28] he's never left us he says he's asking
[20:32] so why don't we believe it but do we
[20:35] think about it as that I've got a little
[20:38] cult now that I'm telling you this is a
[20:40] more or less a few minutes to kind of
[20:42] make sure you understand then I got a
[20:45] little thought I want to express to you
[20:48] that I believe will help us about an
[20:51] ever prayer
[20:52] God and see that's the way I believe it
[20:55] I don't believe he's in the future I
[20:58] don't believe he's in the past I believe
[21:01] he's in the present tense right now
[21:03] now if he moved over ten million years
[21:06] if you could click a switch and ten
[21:08] million years would appear you know he'd
[21:11] still be present right
[21:15] come on or you right in with me if he
[21:18] stepped over ten million years and it
[21:20] clicked and that pice was gone he'd
[21:22] still be ever present that's the point
[21:25] I'm trying to get you to see about the
[21:27] Bible and you'll see that it was written
[21:31] about what happened like Moses and
[21:35] almost three thousand years from the
[21:38] time that Moses comes on the scene to
[21:42] peein Genesis right because you got to
[21:47] thousands of flood then you got maybe
[21:49] have however long it takes to get over
[21:52] to Moses and his riding no to me that's
[21:57] wonderful and he could sit back there
[21:59] and write all the way to the future
[22:02] everything to an end of all things all
[22:06] right but yet still he's never present a
[22:13] God of the future is no good and you
[22:16] don't misunderstand my terms I don't
[22:18] have enough of Education to express
[22:20] myself I just use plain old Georgia
[22:23] language there's no Pais there's no
[22:26] present with God everything I mean no
[22:28] future no past and no future everything
[22:31] is present tense well when are we gonna
[22:35] start believing it that way when we're
[22:41] gonna start believing it that way you
[22:43] know if we ever do believe that he's
[22:45] ever present it'll take away the one
[22:48] little word that is the most horrible
[22:51] thing to all mankind and even affects
[22:55] Christians is the word called fear
[23:04] it'll take away that why let me ask you
[23:08] to cuz this is what I want to get to in
[23:09] a minute over here but I'm gonna bring
[23:11] the baguette why should a Christian fear
[23:15] what is there to fear
[23:20] well I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of
[23:23] that what we'll get to that in a minute
[23:29] but I want to cover the point make sure
[23:30] you understand when John writes the Book
[23:34] of Revelations is coming into view and
[23:36] we went through showing that brother
[23:39] Branham who said that God told John I
[23:43] want you to know who I am before we go
[23:47] into anything all right so he revealed a
[23:52] Godhead we went through that covered the
[23:54] point okay then he says now all right
[23:58] said that's not all the story
[24:01] John write the things that you see and
[24:05] send it to the seven churches that is to
[24:08] come all right now when he comes to that
[24:15] he says John write what you see and he
[24:23] turned to see the voice and being turned
[24:27] he saw seven golden candlesticks that
[24:32] was where God m-more feed or changed his
[24:35] form and on the day of Pentecost he came
[24:40] in to the bride of Jesus Christ
[24:44] at Pentecost that's where he changed his
[24:48] form now he's showing you a reflection
[24:51] of himself in the believers all right
[24:58] and he's he does he said there's one
[25:00] lakh under the son of man he said gird
[25:06] about the powder
[25:07] all right can't veal can't be a woman I
[25:10] mean it you know can't be a man got to
[25:12] be a woman because it's showing where
[25:14] it's going since the bride
[25:16] so I said okay now I want you to know
[25:19] who I am now I want you to know where I
[25:23] went or where he goes to in stage 2 or
[25:27] whatever you want to call it so he goes
[25:29] to the born-again believer on the day of
[25:32] Pentecost all right then you got the
[25:36] book of Acts all right then you start
[25:39] the church ages and the time coming down
[25:42] but he says John before you go any
[25:45] further now you see Who I am
[25:49] that should be settled right in our
[25:51] thoughts and month he showed who he was
[25:53] I'm the Alpha and Omega the beginning
[25:56] and the end all right
[25:58] that's why I said to brother I said this
[26:00] is not even a prophet he said this is
[26:04] the Lord Himself so then he turns and he
[26:09] says all right now John I want you to
[26:13] write what you see and send it to the
[26:17] seven churches all right now I hope you
[26:22] was listening and been listening and
[26:24] we'll listen he goes immediately to
[26:27] describe the position that he moves over
[26:31] into whatever you want to call it he
[26:33] amorphous he changed his form and he's
[26:36] talking to 12 when he turned to see the
[26:39] voice and brother and said I gave you
[26:41] those quotes over and over he said it's
[26:43] not a not a man he said cause of the
[26:47] paps all right and he said he shows here
[26:51] himself revealed in his bride all right
[26:55] and said that shows where he went - in
[26:59] other words all right now was he
[27:04] following that point then and listening
[27:06] see he shows a wonderful situation I
[27:12] want to make sure you don't miss this
[27:14] one on it he shows where he's at
[27:20] he showed who he was he said now you got
[27:25] that right now John now won't you right
[27:27] now
[27:29] and sin to the church ages what you see
[27:32] he didn't start back over on the Godhead
[27:38] come on are you listening verse 1 2 & 3
[27:41] he says I want you to see who I am
[27:45] verse 4 crew 9 and 10
[27:49] he's showing who he is alright he
[27:54] doesn't stop because that's where you
[27:56] won that's messed up see your oneness
[27:59] will come up to that one but they won't
[28:02] move on in - oh yeah they talk about it
[28:06] now listen they talk about the new birth
[28:10] they talk about God in his doings but
[28:13] they stop short I watched that in the
[28:15] Philippines not the Philippines in
[28:18] Jamaica when I preached in that oneness
[28:20] convention
[28:21] I saw where our problem is we can follow
[28:27] up to a certain spot within when we do
[28:30] it just stops me I told you the only
[28:35] thing they followed me I went step by
[28:37] step because I asked the pastor what you
[28:40] want me to do he said my people in the
[28:44] daytime preach your heart out he said at
[28:47] nighttime he said remember you're
[28:49] preaching to people that know nothing
[28:51] about the message nothing like that he
[28:54] said so kind of take it easy at night
[28:55] well that kind of easing along you know
[28:58] but I got to getting a little stronger
[29:00] at night and those people followed me
[29:03] you're to talk to oneness people and
[29:06] they know those scriptures and you look
[29:10] at your songs one of them now yeah you
[29:13] got all kind of songs it was written by
[29:15] a lot of those people that were oneness
[29:17] we see that oneness he stops with Jesus
[29:21] being the life form of God now listen it
[29:27] didn't mean they stopped talking about
[29:30] Jesus or anything like that or talk to
[29:33] you about the Holy Ghost or or what it
[29:35] does or whatever the book of Acts now it
[29:39] just means their their advancement of
[29:41] understand
[29:42] the revelation ended at that point and
[29:47] the only thing they backed off I mean I
[29:49] went through the Scriptures called you
[29:51] know you've heard me tell the story
[29:53] some people had been there and kind of
[29:55] put a bad taste in the mouth about the
[29:57] believers of the message so brother Reed
[30:00] wanted me to kind of just you know go in
[30:03] and and that was so hard to take an old
[30:06] guy like me you know this film I didn't
[30:08] come through Pentecost but I saw what
[30:12] they were the thing they backed up is
[30:15] when I hit Melchizedek I mean they never
[30:19] backed up a stitch on anything about one
[30:22] God Almighty God Jesus being God you can
[30:26] just preach your heart out to the
[30:28] oneness and they lay a menu and go right
[30:32] along with you but then when I hit
[30:34] melchester dick it was just kind of yeah
[30:38] you know I mean you got to know me to
[30:42] know I'm doing me
[30:44] I can tell whether or not you're
[30:46] following what I'm talking about
[30:49] right you know why cause you go to and
[30:52] you won't talk about it you'll just stop
[30:55] and you won't advance so then I know you
[31:00] don't know so I'll back up and I'll come
[31:04] back through okay and then back up and I
[31:08] come back through but to get to point
[31:13] how many in this building is still
[31:15] oneness see now get get me listen you
[31:24] could preach all you want to about the
[31:26] Holy Ghost being in in the church and
[31:29] the Holy Ghost doing this and the
[31:31] healings and the signs and the wonders
[31:33] they would shout their heels off that's
[31:35] you about it but they never saw that
[31:40] that was worth goddamn or feed in to the
[31:44] believers they still want to hold it
[31:46] Jesus only but are you listening
[31:49] you don't mean they don't read the Bible
[31:51] you get me it don't mean that they don't
[31:55] talk about the
[31:58] you go down to the Baptist's today talk
[32:01] to them about the baptism of the Holy
[32:02] Ghost they'll talk we like everything
[32:04] until you strike that one guard just a
[32:07] little bit too close or you hit the
[32:09] water baptism or something and then they
[32:11] just back up on you because the Baptist
[32:16] doctrine is one God I come from there
[32:19] it's one God but it's explained by the
[32:24] Baptist is God in three persons Blessed
[32:26] Trinity but they'll holler you like Amen
[32:29] on one God but then when you say it's
[32:32] not three persons then they just they'll
[32:35] go seeing you know that they're not
[32:38] getting what you're talking about
[32:40] it stops well see then you have to
[32:45] divert around and come back another way
[32:47] go further on said hold that point until
[32:49] people get he said didn't move on he
[32:53] said brother Daly are you calling me a
[32:54] oneness if you don't see the necessity
[33:00] are the importance are the greatest
[33:05] thing that could ever happen in the
[33:06] world to think about that Almighty God
[33:11] never just come to stand down here with
[33:14] us and walk with us and talk with us and
[33:18] guide us and take care of us and protect
[33:20] us he come to live in his people and it
[33:25] took all of those that's why we kept
[33:27] reading in Peter it took all of what
[33:30] those prophets done we're brother
[33:32] Branham would say they built the body
[33:34] the prophets then the body would step
[33:38] out and I would be would be Jesus Christ
[33:40] and he say a body that has retired me
[33:44] see then you know we get hooked on
[33:48] something we we do that one this point
[33:52] we stop and we don't see the future
[33:55] point all right now so one truth like
[33:59] eight or nine ten God is showing who he
[34:02] is all right
[34:05] twelve first way of you know
[34:09] turns to show what he has done all right
[34:13] and John turns to seeing them ever I
[34:16] emphasize it so much John knew who was
[34:18] talking to him he didn't have to turn
[34:20] around he could have said Jesus
[34:22] that's wonderful where you're out cuz he
[34:25] knew who that was but the amazing thing
[34:29] was when he turned what he saw remember
[34:38] what he saw was the bride of Jesus
[34:42] Christ what God in another form they
[34:49] were in no way trying to make the bride
[34:51] greater than the bridegroom right but
[34:57] the bridegroom without the bride is
[34:59] nothing than the bride without the groom
[35:02] is nothing so alright but see the point
[35:06] now he goes I'll show you who I am
[35:08] alright then he turns and he says
[35:11] alright here's where I want you to see
[35:14] my in more fee by changing form and I've
[35:19] made myself known
[35:20] and then he's ever-present there's not a
[35:26] place anywhere if he was ever present
[35:29] with Moses to tell him I am how much
[35:36] more is he ever present with his bride
[35:39] see you're not preaching about when I'm
[35:42] preaching about this chapter I mean you
[35:45] know showing the bride in morphe I'm
[35:47] talking about him in morphe I'm not
[35:52] talking about me and you and Moorthy
[35:55] know we're were here more fees Adam we
[35:59] are the part where he changes from being
[36:04] the one true and living God dwelling as
[36:06] we'd call it won't alone now he's in a
[36:09] mini membered broad not to just the
[36:13] first church age now here's the whole
[36:16] point so get it and then we'll get on to
[36:18] her thought he shows all of the seven
[36:22] churches
[36:24] all right he shows John that and then
[36:29] John sees so much he falls down at his
[36:32] feet you realize that John to the point
[36:37] had got to work
[36:38] he couldn't separate between what he saw
[36:43] and who he was talking about because he
[36:52] seemed goddamn more feet to another
[36:54] stage of the journey and to come forth
[36:56] in bride form alright
[37:01] are you following that C and not back up
[37:04] to wait a minute now I seem in Jesus I
[37:06] just can't see and here's where we are
[37:09] here's the message with I can see them
[37:11] in Jesus I'd see them brother branham oh
[37:15] yeah I tell y'all about right around
[37:17] them and all the healings and signs and
[37:19] wonders and the greater praise God you
[37:22] realize that don't save nobody now you
[37:26] show me where it does tell me worth
[37:32] knowing about wrote around saves you
[37:35] knowing about the Lord Jesus don't save
[37:38] you knowing what I'm talking about and
[37:43] I'm finally telling you five sermons to
[37:46] get you to go from the point of seeing
[37:48] God and were he who is over to the basis
[37:53] of seeing where he and more fit into his
[37:56] bride under their Pentecost and told
[37:59] John to write this and so how perfect
[38:03] the church is before he ever pinned one
[38:08] word in the church ages before he ever
[38:16] pin one word in the church ages he's
[38:19] already told a bride how perfect she is
[38:21] before she ever done one time will get
[38:26] over into the church ages and will see
[38:27] it so if you will read them and just
[38:29] keep reading them cuz you see there will
[38:30] be things in there you know this is good
[38:32] and that's a bad and then I hate this
[38:34] and I hate that you hate
[38:35] to me within the license always ones
[38:37] that what what is the last thing that
[38:40] ever to change
[38:41] to him that overcometh now how do we
[38:45] overcome not in ourselves we have to be
[38:51] in Jesus Christ to be an overcomer
[38:54] we're not an overcomer by ourselves I
[38:56] don't care what we think we are we're
[38:59] not we're that grouping that said that
[39:02] setting her seeing another stage we
[39:05] can't get to it
[39:07] we know that it's talking about
[39:09] something we Baptist talked about a god
[39:12] of glory that was eternal and lived upon
[39:16] earth within when somebody comes along
[39:21] and says hey what about this no we don't
[39:25] quite see that
[39:26] well we Baptist we'd take pastors and we
[39:32] take evangelists and everyone's why we
[39:35] kind of deal with the teachers now but
[39:38] that apostles the Prophet never was
[39:39] mentioned and I was there 10 15 years
[39:43] and the Baptist Deacon so I happen to
[39:46] know a little bit about their doctrine
[39:48] and you see it goes so far and then stop
[39:53] all right kind of like it more said one
[40:01] day he said Java witness or no not
[40:05] Jehovah Witness Mormon he said if you
[40:08] just understood about prophets meaning
[40:09] you could talk let's break down I said
[40:14] let's just do a little talking I think I
[40:16] understand a little bit about prophets
[40:18] what I meant was I think I understand a
[40:20] little more than you do you know that
[40:22] was really what I was telling him but I
[40:24] didn't want to blast him with you so I
[40:26] said okay now we talk about prophets you
[40:28] know all right but listen do you
[40:31] following me God shows who is then he
[40:36] shows where he and more fees to his
[40:37] second stage and when he had more feed
[40:40] into that second stage now here's the
[40:43] points or listen get it he showed the
[40:47] church
[40:48] how perfect she was before she ever
[40:51] started so you're getting into
[40:56] pre-existence I'm getting into pre
[40:59] existence of God I've always believed in
[41:01] the pre existence of God don't you and
[41:04] that's who I'm talking about in morphing
[41:06] Jesus Christ and morphing into his
[41:08] church it is not you and me the church
[41:12] ages is not in you its Christ in me in
[41:15] you right
[41:18] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[41:20] uh-huh so you get what I'm talking about
[41:23] then then as he shows him one standing
[41:27] in the midst of seven golden Kenneth a
[41:29] lock under the Son of man see not the
[41:32] son of man because that physical part
[41:33] don't show up now you got to remember
[41:35] this is the church age this is the
[41:37] writing of John and Shawn you got to
[41:40] remember what we've been trying to bring
[41:41] when Jesus said who the man say i the
[41:43] son of man am Peter couldn't answer his
[41:46] question but he answered what God
[41:48] revealed thou art the Christ the Son of
[41:50] the Living God Jesus in other words said
[41:54] I didn't ask you that I asked you who
[41:56] was the son of man but I know you can't
[41:59] follow it he's seen him stop right he
[42:03] knew he couldn't progress so he said all
[42:06] right we take this about the baptism of
[42:09] the Holy Ghost and then I'll describe to
[42:12] you what you look like because you are
[42:16] Animorph II of God on the earth that's
[42:20] the Bride of Christ and said you'll be
[42:23] like what Son of Man :
[42:25] look come on listen what is it page 12
[42:27] it's a rise in the Sunna I know it's in
[42:29] the Reiser's huh but Ron said who is
[42:31] this son of man he said in the beginning
[42:34] was the word and the Word was with God
[42:38] who is this if you're seeing here God in
[42:42] another form called the bride uh-huh now
[42:49] he shows her then how perfect now come
[42:57] on we're gonna we're gonna top some
[42:58] scriptures in a minute that I hope
[42:59] follows is because I've waited and
[43:01] waited
[43:02] till I get a thought in honor I thought
[43:06] your Bible said that those who he had
[43:10] justified want
[43:14] he has already what glorified now we're
[43:20] we're glorified by this glorified
[43:24] nothing you see in 90% of my actions has
[43:28] nothing to do with glorification but
[43:32] what was the thing we gave the quote
[43:34] they were on the internet so you don't
[43:36] have to tell them but you know what
[43:37] would it little Ron said that talking
[43:39] about the bride he said that was him
[43:41] standing there glorified where is God
[43:46] glorified in his church
[43:50] you realize before what I'm trying to
[43:53] say before he ever started anything he
[43:58] tells him how perfect they are we never
[44:05] brother Dale I'm not perfect I'll agree
[44:06] we ain't no it's perfect we'd like to
[44:09] worry about it all right but it's what
[44:12] he says he says those he justified he's
[44:19] already glorified we see we won't
[44:23] student was standing and truthful right
[44:25] cuz we're human we're standing here boy
[44:27] I'll be glad when he days when this body
[44:29] is glorified in God it's already done
[44:32] he's done Satan it that's what I'm
[44:34] trying to get you the same he's done
[44:37] showing you how perfect you are
[44:40] that's the spaces of five sermons this
[44:43] is number is to hit the point of showing
[44:46] that in the bride God is glorified
[44:50] already as far as he's concerned
[44:54] we're already changed we're already
[44:56] eternal we're already that as far as God
[44:59] is concerned sure we've gotta wait but
[45:03] what does that got to do with it now I'm
[45:07] going to say something that I hope goes
[45:10] over the right everybody's looking for
[45:13] this to happen that to have this out
[45:14] brother dad what are you looking for
[45:18] the thing that I've always looked for
[45:21] when I first started in the message is
[45:24] to find a group of people that would
[45:28] believe what a prophet said Oh
[45:34] the Prophet said yes like I said about
[45:39] the madness we would talk you can talk
[45:41] to the believers oh yes the message is
[45:44] here we've got the message and
[45:46] everything we need is here three months
[45:48] later they're gone and and destroying
[45:50] the message and everything could ever be
[45:52] thought of right one because they got so
[45:57] far and they couldn't see no further if
[46:01] you can't see no further you're in
[46:02] dangerous
[46:03] I warn you any time you come to a block
[46:08] state be careful because you can jump on
[46:14] the other side and get on the wrong time
[46:16] are you gonna back up to saying well I
[46:18] don't believe nothing's going on I don't
[46:20] see nothing I know just remember if you
[46:24] say you don't believe there's anything
[46:26] going on then you're denying God's Word
[46:36] because God said he never would leave us
[46:41] but run said there's never been an age
[46:43] that's looking at that this morning
[46:46] never been an age that God didn't live
[46:50] and abide in that age and have a
[46:53] believer for that period of time but
[47:01] listen do you get it then that maybe we
[47:03] can hit the point he shows and he says
[47:09] the sound of many waters you can go into
[47:11] explaining all the whole thing coming
[47:15] down which is the ministers bringing the
[47:17] message and the things you can go
[47:19] through all of that but I'm trying to
[47:20] just save time to get you to a thought
[47:24] chapter one is showing Almighty God
[47:30] and showing the church ages before they
[47:36] ever transpire all right
[47:39] showing how perfect the church is but do
[47:47] we believe it they were really building
[47:52] it no off a rope won't self a note and
[47:54] then don't read my notes Mary and Micah
[47:57] and the baby landed in the Philippines
[48:00] safely so we thank God for that
[48:02] everywhere they have Japan Japan all
[48:06] right there's our they don't matter what
[48:09] country I call it they're there all
[48:12] right
[48:12] I wrote that hand work and then don't
[48:14] even read my own notes okay but now
[48:17] listen why would brother branham make
[48:21] statements like this he said when Titus
[48:28] come into Jerusalem weight quoted to
[48:30] tell the day when Titus come into
[48:34] Jerusalem all those Jews run back into
[48:40] the temple right because they believed
[48:43] that God would fight for brother Branham
[48:46] said not one and I can't find a wording
[48:50] so you can help me with
[48:51] he's either Christian or believer he
[48:54] said not one Christian was in the walls
[48:58] of Jerusalem somebody's shaking your
[49:01] head so you know it's right okay
[49:02] I believe it don't you then why because
[49:05] God had told them when you see these
[49:09] things Jesus speaking of taking place
[49:11] and this happens and you see the mosque
[49:13] of Omar you see that every time yeah but
[49:15] that's got me no no when you see this
[49:17] happening this way said get out and
[49:21] birthday left but around said not one
[49:24] true believer was left in the walls of
[49:27] Jerusalem
[49:34] and not a wonderful thing to think about
[49:42] God thinking so much of the people till
[49:45] he wouldn't even leave them there not
[49:50] one true believer was left in Jerusalem
[49:53] they all left
[49:58] listen Church showing that that Roman
[50:01] bug coming home down no matter why they
[50:02] ain't gonna be no true believers left in
[50:04] the wrong place
[50:06] okay now here we're gonna try to get a
[50:09] thought then I'll quit cuz do you
[50:12] understand that do you understand
[50:14] John is seeing future everything and
[50:20] what he's - right - and who is to do one
[50:22] and when it is if showing Jesus Christ
[50:25] as he lives the church ages is not going
[50:27] to show because now listen do you have a
[50:30] red-letter additional Bible then chapter
[50:35] one
[50:35] I mean chapter one is basically red
[50:38] letter code is talking about who that is
[50:39] chapter 2 and chapter 3 is totally
[50:42] there's like two words in chapter 2 or 3
[50:45] that is not read letter meaning that's
[50:49] what Jesus said
[50:50] right is that the point we're supposed
[50:53] to be getting when that words the ad
[50:56] he's in his bride so in the book here
[51:00] that we read and we see that it comes
[51:01] down John says and he looks and
[51:04] front-run said this ain't a prophet
[51:05] listen he said this is god john falls
[51:08] down here to worship cuz this is
[51:16] almighty god so you can't put and say
[51:19] well brother branham was in chapter 1 no
[51:21] he wasn't
[51:22] no now you get over to when we get over
[51:26] to 17 18 19 we're gonna start picking up
[51:28] something alright and we'll see some
[51:31] times but don't do it with chapter 1
[51:35] because chapter 1 totally reveals who
[51:38] this is
[51:39] it's Almighty God him morphing into his
[51:43] church and showing her how perfect she
[51:47] is
[51:48] now listen get this and earn this Inc
[51:50] Ankara didn't be showing her before
[51:53] anything ever starts how perfect God
[51:56] sees her right yeah I was thinking about
[52:09] something the other day just meditating
[52:12] on the scriptures and things and I got
[52:21] to thinking about o people you know and
[52:27] life and you know we're wonderfully
[52:31] blessed people I mean even the worst
[52:34] that we have were wonderfully blessed it
[52:38] don't even pictures don't even show some
[52:40] of these situations in these foreign
[52:43] countries and things like that their
[52:45] living conditions and their things and I
[52:48] was thinking about that and I was
[52:51] praying I said Lord them the poor little
[52:58] kids demo dog some people living in
[53:03] those shacks look at under conditioners
[53:09] you know almost inhuman conditions to
[53:13] look at no running water no bathroom no
[53:18] nothing's and you know I'll you've never
[53:22] raised in the point to where when it
[53:24] rained we had to move the pots now
[53:26] you're the one knows what I mean because
[53:29] the roof leaks so much you had to put
[53:30] apart underneath that spot you had to
[53:32] move the bed over in the middle of the
[53:34] night because he didn't he was gonna get
[53:35] wet we lived under some of those things
[53:38] but they were still not doing but I was
[53:45] taking about Lord
[53:53] how great it is to be here you know we
[53:58] have our problems but those poor people
[54:01] especially that they don't have nothing
[54:06] hardly indictor mercy they're at the
[54:10] mercy of the elements living in
[54:14] conditions that are beyond any thought
[54:18] and you know subject to to the weather
[54:24] subject to animals and all kind of
[54:28] things I said Lord could you just help
[54:34] them you know could you just help them a
[54:41] little bit and all at once the answer
[54:51] came
[54:58] the answer was very simple and he said I
[55:10] said I'm with them they don't look like
[55:18] it but you can't argue a him and I
[55:24] thought about them little kids and even
[55:28] the teenagers and things you know and
[55:30] just living off of what they could grab
[55:32] a heat and steal in Jamaica we've set in
[55:35] aeterna you could see a light up in a
[55:38] tree and and I said what did that
[55:40] brother read he said that's a candle and
[55:45] he says there they're getting the apples
[55:46] off that apple tree
[55:48] well they had a stick and the candles
[55:50] sticking out on that thing
[55:51] and I had a knife blade fixed and had a
[55:54] little bag that ingeniously forever I
[55:58] you say the word they had figured out
[56:00] this thing they had a little bucket and
[56:02] they just run that up and that candle
[56:04] they could see the awful and they just -
[56:06] then it would fall in that little thing
[56:08] and they'd take him out the next day on
[56:10] side of the road and sell him I've seen
[56:13] things like that but the main thing I
[56:16] was thinking about was like animals and
[56:18] times at the mercy you know snakes and
[56:22] all like that it you know and it just
[56:27] come to me said I'm tired
[56:31] yeah okay I got to thinking then about
[56:40] the the way the prophet described things
[56:43] and the way the Bible talked about it
[56:47] and you know in the book of Job Satan
[56:53] asked to try to get to job and what a
[56:55] God release and now you can do this -
[56:59] that you don't touch him but anyhow what
[57:01] do you say to start with what if Satan
[57:03] say now this is not a born-again
[57:06] believer okay job's not a born-again
[57:09] believer but what did he say to him
[57:12] Satan says you got a hage build around
[57:16] him and said there's no way I can get to
[57:22] him we here brother branham talk about
[57:27] sickness cannot come upon us without God
[57:31] permitting it but yet we run our human
[57:35] brains runs hog wild and our thinking
[57:44] see God wasn't there protecting job from
[57:48] bad cold
[57:50] sinus problems now come on I'm trying to
[57:55] be honest and straight with you to get
[57:57] it right through all the way through the
[57:59] Bible where we can say what we need to
[58:01] say did brother Branham was he sick oh
[58:07] yeah yeah well now was the Lord Jesus
[58:11] sick they've run around city grown with
[58:17] a headache after raising it was he
[58:20] subject to sicknesses so when it says
[58:24] that you know he had a hedge around job
[58:28] did that hedge mean that there was no
[58:31] way for him to stop his tow and tire the
[58:35] end off of it and it be hurt him
[58:37] no was it any kind of a small little
[58:42] effect of something of life that he ate
[58:44] the wrong thing and wound up with
[58:46] diarrhea and or something you know see
[58:51] we get it all in the wrong direction
[58:52] that's what he was trying to show me we
[58:57] think what we're Christians we're not
[58:58] supposed to have any time no problems to
[59:02] a Christian well what do you mean
[59:03] brother Dale you got sinus problems yeah
[59:11] come on I face them in with these
[59:13] questions years ago you know that a lot
[59:16] of your Pentecostal didn't agree with
[59:17] brother Branham you know why be
[59:23] Cosi went to the doctor right we had one
[59:31] brother you sit up here
[59:32] he said if you see me and I get cut - -
[59:36] he said you leave me alone he said don't
[59:42] you take me to the doctor I said brother
[59:44] you're dumb I'm just as clear as clear
[59:47] as I could make him trying to explain to
[59:49] him I said that's wrong and this other
[59:53] brother used to come here I mean I face
[59:55] these and talk to him okay
[59:57] this brother he said I ain't gonna take
[59:58] no medicine for nothing well after a
[1:00:03] while I asked him I said you're taking
[1:00:06] me Ashley
[1:00:07] well yeah oh I thought you didn't
[1:00:11] believe in taking medicine but that's
[1:00:14] not medicine that's that's I said a dog
[1:00:20] goes out in the yard and gets sick he
[1:00:22] goes out in the yard and he's grass he
[1:00:25] vomits he gets better I said what'd he
[1:00:27] do he took medicine right I said you're
[1:00:32] trying to say take no medicine you're
[1:00:35] not in the Bible with it that's what the
[1:00:37] Lord Jesus was sick I said brother
[1:00:42] Brandon went to the doctors and I said
[1:00:45] that's where your Pentecostals a lot of
[1:00:47] them didn't agree I've talked with two
[1:00:49] brothers are used to sit here that it's
[1:00:51] wired to the fact that they that was why
[1:00:54] I hurt them about brother Branham that
[1:00:56] he went to the doctor see there was so
[1:01:01] spiritual today they'd believe in taking
[1:01:05] no medication but you know what it's
[1:01:09] life when I own little with those people
[1:01:11] I kind of watched them you know and they
[1:01:13] take him aspirin
[1:01:14] next thing they take of this next thing
[1:01:16] you take their night a while they his
[1:01:17] own medicine it's like all the rest of
[1:01:19] us I didn't make no light of them
[1:01:21] I'm not making light of them now they
[1:01:23] were sincere people honest and great but
[1:01:27] that brother when I'm told us it if you
[1:01:29] see me laying I cut having to don't take
[1:01:31] me to no doctor they'd leave me alone
[1:01:36] because they were so spiritual but we
[1:01:39] laugh at him but don't laugh at him
[1:01:41] because they were sincere in their
[1:01:43] thinking is it wrong to go to the
[1:01:49] doctors can I quote you the Prophet what
[1:01:54] he said one day he said your first duty
[1:01:57] is to go to the doctor no no I'm sure
[1:02:03] I'm to pray he said your first time he
[1:02:06] said in other words I'm paraphrasing it
[1:02:10] but it's close enough he said in other
[1:02:13] words I shouldn't even pray for you
[1:02:15] until you go to the doctor
[1:02:17] that's perforated but it's close enough
[1:02:22] you said you wouldn't but you're trying
[1:02:24] to make it no I'm trying to make him
[1:02:26] what he was and I'm trying to make it
[1:02:29] like it is we wind up with sinus problem
[1:02:33] you realize that if you base it upon
[1:02:35] what we think as to the basis of our
[1:02:38] Christianity would be based upon the
[1:02:40] point of whether we went to the doctors
[1:02:42] or not you realize that everybody in
[1:02:44] this building including me would be lost
[1:02:50] because if you take herbs if you take
[1:02:53] any medication and take anything that's
[1:02:54] medicine so you try to justify no that's
[1:02:59] not medicine that's that's natural thing
[1:03:03] well I get a headache and naturally
[1:03:08] reach for a bottle take a pill take a
[1:03:09] aspirin that's natural to me what do you
[1:03:12] do I go on with a headache no you don't
[1:03:16] come on we're not against anything we're
[1:03:20] trying to tell the truth but tell it
[1:03:22] like it is because you have a headache
[1:03:24] doesn't mean you're lost it doesn't mean
[1:03:28] the wrath of God has been poured out on
[1:03:30] you it doesn't mean that's got that
[1:03:33] Satan had talked God into allowing him
[1:03:36] to give you a headache because those are
[1:03:40] natural life now we're gonna place it
[1:03:45] over into something else in a minute so
[1:03:46] watch what you're agreeing with are
[1:03:48] different with it
[1:03:49] you think about what I'm saying because
[1:03:53] it mean it's a very serious matter it's
[1:03:58] not wrong to be sick if it is then what
[1:04:04] are you gonna do with one of these
[1:04:06] attributes I am the lord that healeth
[1:04:09] all of our diseases take it away you
[1:04:14] take it away if you don't agree with it
[1:04:17] well brother tell you I'm just telling
[1:04:20] the truth the best that I can
[1:04:24] it's not wrong to go to the doctor it's
[1:04:27] wrong to take the doctors word against
[1:04:30] God's Word now are we right now
[1:04:33] come on you follow me it's wrong to take
[1:04:35] the doctors word against God's Word but
[1:04:42] I see most of you and I've been down
[1:04:43] myself and most everybody out dwelt with
[1:04:45] they like you know they can come up you
[1:04:48] take somebody that'll wind up with
[1:04:49] cancer or some disease and and they'll
[1:04:52] come and they'll say by stripes I'm
[1:04:54] healed I'm healed
[1:04:57] let's God you can't tell me I heal I'm
[1:04:59] healed about a year later
[1:05:03] would you mind praying for me I'm having
[1:05:06] problems with this you see them start
[1:05:09] breaking down two or three years later
[1:05:12] they're dying with cancer we get all of
[1:05:16] that time they screamed and hollered
[1:05:17] that by His stripes we were healed who
[1:05:21] lied what went wrong could it be that
[1:05:27] most of our confessions is confessions
[1:05:31] without a possession about it yeah I've
[1:05:37] seen those things I saw a man one time
[1:05:39] that he had I guess you call the
[1:05:41] gangrene there what it was in his foot
[1:05:43] oh brother mark he's passed on now and
[1:05:47] he wouldn't take no medication but he
[1:05:50] was a diabetic man he ate sugar like
[1:05:52] going out of style I always told him and
[1:05:54] trouble but anyhow he was laying up in
[1:05:57] the hospital
[1:06:01] they're begging him to take his leg off
[1:06:03] at least his foot because it had already
[1:06:06] started turning colors and gangrene was
[1:06:09] sitting I was there and saw him I looked
[1:06:13] down at his foot and went sick because
[1:06:19] you could see ever ligament everything
[1:06:22] in his foot there was no meat on the
[1:06:25] foot it had already been eaten away I
[1:06:29] was looking down to just tendons or what
[1:06:33] you call them strip sometimes with a
[1:06:35] little meat around it and it ring it in
[1:06:37] his leg already turning and already
[1:06:40] getting in the doctor says we've gotta
[1:06:42] take you no please talk him into taking
[1:06:45] that off he said I walked in here with
[1:06:49] it and I'll walk out of here with it I'm
[1:06:56] honest I begged him that's to take it
[1:06:59] I'm gonna do you faith he said I said it
[1:07:04] and I'll stand by it
[1:07:05] you know what he walked out of that
[1:07:08] Hospital on that leg and that bullet the
[1:07:12] day he died he had no more trouble with
[1:07:14] that foot well our faith there's
[1:07:20] situations that is true faith it takes
[1:07:22] over and I believe it now I believe in
[1:07:29] healing yes but I believe also that a
[1:07:35] lot we blame this we're blaming God for
[1:07:38] it because then we question why am I
[1:07:40] sick Lord what have I done
[1:07:43] I thought we believed that sometimes he
[1:07:47] things were put on us to make us think
[1:07:51] and that would be God releasing Satan to
[1:07:55] where he could work on us but get my
[1:07:57] point so we move on because you got us
[1:08:00] sniffling bad cold don't mean God has
[1:08:02] put ever allowed ever devil to jump on
[1:08:05] to you it just means you're sick right
[1:08:12] because we don't you gonna have all of
[1:08:14] it going you know every little situation
[1:08:18] you come up with it's not sicknesses
[1:08:21] it's a part of the environment that we
[1:08:24] live in that were subject to sickness
[1:08:31] many are the afflictions of the
[1:08:33] righteous
[1:08:36] he said well you start off pretty good a
[1:08:38] minute ago but you're killing me now
[1:08:41] well maybe we need killing
[1:08:48] come on just get this simple to the
[1:08:50] point then I'll move on to though
[1:08:52] because you have a sniffling cold don't
[1:08:54] mean that God has returned the devil
[1:08:56] loose onto you it just means you're in
[1:09:02] the world because who turned it loose on
[1:09:06] Jesus then brother Branham had
[1:09:14] sicknesses right because I remember
[1:09:17] talking with a brother about it's in the
[1:09:19] message of Jehovah Jireh in California
[1:09:21] I'm pretty sure at 62 we're brother
[1:09:24] Branham he was seeing the sick healed of
[1:09:26] all forms and signs and wonders I don't
[1:09:28] remember the day it might have been
[1:09:29] raised and all in those meeting he's
[1:09:31] going doctor every day by the stomach he
[1:09:38] said well I was that was the devil let
[1:09:40] loose that's okay are we I'm just gonna
[1:09:45] tell you we're a subject to being sick
[1:09:50] but what's the first thing we do when
[1:09:53] something goes wrong Lord what did I do
[1:09:59] right Lord what have I done that this
[1:10:03] has come on me why not say it this way
[1:10:12] God thank you for allowing this to come
[1:10:15] on to me to bring me to him is that any
[1:10:20] problem we're saying it like that
[1:10:24] that I can take them the things that
[1:10:26] affect me and I can come closer to the
[1:10:29] Lord in that and stay just as sick
[1:10:38] what's wrong why can't we he said well
[1:10:42] what's your thought I'm talking about a
[1:10:44] never president eternal God now if he's
[1:10:48] ever present he's he with you when
[1:10:54] you're well and gone when you're sick no
[1:10:59] he's with us more than were sick because
[1:11:02] he's displaying his attributes as healer
[1:11:05] and all kind of thing if we just think
[1:11:07] that away we cared wait up to the doctor
[1:11:13] one time and oh man he'd run temperature
[1:11:15] back that days I mean we talked about a
[1:11:17] hundred and two nouns running off the
[1:11:19] scale waited to have 105 because of his
[1:11:22] tonsils just swelled out and all that
[1:11:23] finally had to take him out but you know
[1:11:26] so he was sick one time and that's about
[1:11:29] all the time ever miss Church I guess
[1:11:30] and we we stayed there with him brother
[1:11:33] tied him them was mr. Tatem stayed with
[1:11:35] us and we prayed for him I all day and
[1:11:40] he just got worse and worse so he
[1:11:43] finally said okay let's go to the doctor
[1:11:44] so we go to the doctor we walk into the
[1:11:48] doctor's office and the doctor meets us
[1:11:51] in his office was a nice guy you know he
[1:11:53] opened up and let us in and just about
[1:11:57] the time Wade walked inside the door and
[1:12:00] got in the building they could have done
[1:12:02] it before then but he didn't die he just
[1:12:05] walked in the door and about that time
[1:12:07] he just covered that place up and
[1:12:09] vomited all over everything you know
[1:12:12] what the doctor said this is what I said
[1:12:17] he said take him on back home hit me
[1:12:19] hard
[1:12:19] he said I'll give him some medicine to
[1:12:22] help him in thanks but said he's alright
[1:12:24] now that's a doctor can I play for them
[1:12:29] you know this can we help you clean
[1:12:33] though he said no we got a cleaner for
[1:12:34] that he just is nice he said but just
[1:12:37] take him on back home
[1:12:39] well you know what we just put him in
[1:12:41] the car we got it my better than ever
[1:12:42] they char all right but you see we don't
[1:12:47] think God is with us on everything you
[1:12:52] know and we're getting a listen trying
[1:12:55] to explain something hard to do we get a
[1:12:56] sniffling cold and then after a while we
[1:12:58] finally realize well hey this is not a
[1:13:00] major disastrous thing and we just
[1:13:04] stopped praying you ever do that here we
[1:13:10] get sick and you get about halfway over
[1:13:12] it here's the worst thing here's the
[1:13:15] worst thing of any of us is when we get
[1:13:18] sick and then we get about halfway well
[1:13:19] and we stop praying you know what
[1:13:25] happens it'll come back instead of us
[1:13:30] keep on praying all right that's what
[1:13:37] I'm asking you your thoughts are we
[1:13:42] immune to sickness no but neither is it
[1:13:50] because that I'm sick you know we'll say
[1:13:54] and how many people has even said it and
[1:13:56] you think about it you say well this is
[1:13:59] on me for the glory of the Lord and
[1:14:01] maybe you know he can if I die now if I
[1:14:05] die with it maybe he and some medical
[1:14:07] science can take this to help other
[1:14:09] people now in that nice that we didn't
[1:14:12] help God ain't that wonderful that we
[1:14:16] can happen run the show you said what I
[1:14:20] said that well that's that's what I'm
[1:14:23] talking about all of us has said those
[1:14:24] things because we're wick were messed up
[1:14:28] warped up twisted up in our thinking
[1:14:30] about sicknesses in life
[1:14:42] families children are born you know
[1:14:45] deformed does that mean that God is
[1:14:49] against that family you ain't careful
[1:14:52] you're gonna have a lot of problems
[1:14:53] because you're gonna have families where
[1:14:55] things are born well I I just don't see
[1:14:58] how they could ever be saved because
[1:15:00] there's some reason it was brought down
[1:15:03] like that on that child God don't need
[1:15:07] no help and don't worry about it the
[1:15:12] devil don't either he don't need our
[1:15:16] help but you say what's he talking about
[1:15:22] I got to thinking you know how the
[1:15:25] Prophet said it I got him here if you
[1:15:28] want
[1:15:31] he said only the redeemed have angels he
[1:15:35] said now it's not said for sinners but
[1:15:37] there's another quote where he says
[1:15:39] everybody has an angel there's a quote
[1:15:42] to that but then this quote C is showing
[1:15:44] you where he's laying it in order he
[1:15:47] said only the redeemed of angels right
[1:15:55] what is the redeems angel is it
[1:16:00] necessarily a personal situation or is
[1:16:04] it and I can show you what the Prophet
[1:16:05] says it's the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[1:16:07] is your personal angel now we start dire
[1:16:11] and then we can go on to the point of
[1:16:13] having angels but we got to start with
[1:16:16] the fact that it's the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:20] then we can go to ministering spirits
[1:16:23] that are ministering unto the people of
[1:16:26] God
[1:16:28] do you realize one thought I mean do you
[1:16:35] need to quote anybody need it but you
[1:16:37] believe brother Allen said only the
[1:16:39] redeemed have angels the only redeemed
[1:16:43] now the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:16:45] so that baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:48] your angel that doesn't do away with
[1:16:50] angels that God gills
[1:16:54] though the Bible said and I love it to
[1:16:56] where it says it the Bible does not say
[1:16:59] the angels of God are encamped about
[1:17:02] those who theory
[1:17:03] now you go hunting the scripture you
[1:17:05] gonna say it doesn't say that it says
[1:17:07] the angel singular it never says angels
[1:17:13] it says the angel of God which is the
[1:17:17] Holy Ghost himself but then there's
[1:17:20] ministering spirits in the situation of
[1:17:24] helping each one of us but now here's
[1:17:29] the story let's see if we can tie
[1:17:31] something together because our point of
[1:17:35] the Book of Revelations was what first
[1:17:37] God shows who he is second he shows
[1:17:40] where he amorphous and the third part of
[1:17:43] our thought as to what to see that John
[1:17:45] in his writings shows God showing John
[1:17:49] how perfect the bride already is not it
[1:17:53] she's going to have to be made perfect
[1:17:56] as far as God is concerned she's already
[1:17:59] finished she's perfect
[1:18:02] so those he justified he's already
[1:18:05] glorified no one asked you a simple
[1:18:08] question if you are now get the point
[1:18:14] I'm staying with the Prophet I'll give
[1:18:17] you quotes for things but then my quote
[1:18:19] is straight of what only the redeemed
[1:18:22] have angels so when brother Brown says
[1:18:25] everybody has an angel now and then he
[1:18:28] turns around and he says only the
[1:18:30] redeemed have angels okay I didn't give
[1:18:35] him this but this is the message the
[1:18:37] resurrection of Lazarus yeah he's got
[1:18:42] angels Gabriel minor angels comes yes
[1:18:46] you see angels everyone has a guardian
[1:18:50] angel according to the scripture jesus
[1:18:53] said they're angels always behold my
[1:18:56] father's faith which is in heaven
[1:19:00] now he says but then he goes on to what
[1:19:04] questions and answers in 64 and he said
[1:19:08] it isn't promised that sinners have
[1:19:10] angels has angels it's only the redeemed
[1:19:13] have angels all right now he's
[1:19:17] explaining itself you know they show the
[1:19:22] picture of the angels and the little
[1:19:24] children I'm honest until that child
[1:19:29] becomes to an age of accountability
[1:19:31] I believe God gives protection to little
[1:19:39] ones that's what I was thinking about I
[1:19:42] think about them little babies laying up
[1:19:45] in there more buildings over there and
[1:19:46] jungles and snakes crawling all over the
[1:19:49] place and biting them and you know I got
[1:19:52] to thinking well you know what
[1:19:55] ain't a snake the world over gonna touch
[1:19:56] a child if it ain't your little God
[1:19:59] isn't her ain't gonna do it
[1:20:06] trying to get you to see fear needs to
[1:20:08] be going out the door of the church
[1:20:10] cause as long as fears with us we're not
[1:20:12] going anywhere
[1:20:14] but see little babies you could think
[1:20:18] about
[1:20:19] but he says sinners now the same prophet
[1:20:23] explained it says sinners don't have
[1:20:26] angels only the redeemed so only the
[1:20:33] redeemed have the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:34] Ghost that is your angel but that
[1:20:37] doesn't do away with your own personal
[1:20:39] angel called run run said you have a
[1:20:40] personal angel like I've always told you
[1:20:47] when I get there I'm will have to
[1:20:48] apologize to mine because I'll keep him
[1:20:49] busy I can't believe I got to I don't
[1:20:53] mean that was a joke I just mean it at a
[1:20:55] point
[1:20:55] Oh straightness the life that I've been
[1:20:58] and where I've been and walked I believe
[1:21:01] he might be I've done of him hanging
[1:21:03] around me and I thank God for him what
[1:21:08] have you ever been to a place that
[1:21:10] everybody was afraid but you you just
[1:21:12] stand there not afraid to speak
[1:21:19] and everybody else is scared you've been
[1:21:23] mad away yeah
[1:21:27] harm going wrong all around Unitas well
[1:21:32] because there's something happened all
[1:21:36] right the only the redeemed now how the
[1:21:39] angel
[1:21:39] well not less here's the question won't
[1:21:41] ask you if we believe in predestination
[1:21:46] maybe one day I'll get back to that if
[1:21:49] we really believe in predestination
[1:21:52] do you realize then the prophets right
[1:21:56] if you take it correctly that you were
[1:22:00] born with a seed in you I believe in
[1:22:04] that they just don't believe it the way
[1:22:06] the people of the message try to explain
[1:22:08] it because it explains it as dissenters
[1:22:11] and everybody else's God it's just
[1:22:12] mm-hmm
[1:22:16] but if you're ever going to receive the
[1:22:18] baptism in the Holy Ghost as the new
[1:22:20] birth now already listening if you ever
[1:22:24] are going to receive the baptism of the
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost as the new prayer does God
[1:22:30] have to wait till there for an angel to
[1:22:35] be assigned to you to take care of you
[1:22:43] the come on you ought to think about in
[1:22:45] your life sometimes what has happened in
[1:22:47] your life and thinking how the things
[1:22:53] just changed if you just just just think
[1:23:01] about it if you're ever going to receive
[1:23:06] eternal life
[1:23:07] as far as God is concerned you already
[1:23:10] have it cuz they leave justified it
[1:23:12] already clarified there's the way the
[1:23:15] Prophet explained if you have eternal
[1:23:17] life you always was eternal what eternal
[1:23:21] life always was eternal not to you as a
[1:23:24] human person because you're not eternal
[1:23:26] now I'm talking about fleshly thing
[1:23:37] but Jesus said I'll be with you always
[1:23:43] he didn't say always I emphasize
[1:23:49] scripture to the point of what it say
[1:23:50] he's done with you all in other words he
[1:23:53] says I'm there when you need me that's
[1:23:55] the best way I can define that as from
[1:23:57] between always and always always would
[1:24:01] mean he would never in any way leave
[1:24:03] from me and I believe that that he does
[1:24:06] but I believe it like this sometimes he
[1:24:09] withdraws his presence and allows things
[1:24:13] to take place so that we'll learn to
[1:24:17] love him
[1:24:20] not a sniffling bad cold I went through
[1:24:23] that I hope enough to where that you say
[1:24:26] I failed in a I broke a leg well I tell
[1:24:30] you what I'm glad God is with me cause
[1:24:32] Hatton I broke both of them I like what
[1:24:36] brother monks had one to help he said
[1:24:39] somebody was saying you know said I've
[1:24:41] got an arm off for the glory of the Lord
[1:24:45] well you know brother mode anybody knew
[1:24:47] him he he liked me I guess that's where
[1:24:50] I learned to be Frank he said okay let's
[1:24:53] just cut both arms off we'll give him
[1:24:55] double glory well that don't fit does it
[1:24:59] no we want to take it for what we won't
[1:25:03] you know I stand here and preached a lot
[1:25:07] of times when my left leg is just
[1:25:09] burning like fire
[1:25:11] everybody says put brother Dick's here
[1:25:13] we had it we talked to the hot off we'd
[1:25:15] only mean I'm just that stubborn he said
[1:25:19] why don't you set out I wouldn't hurt
[1:25:20] her thankfully so I'm stubborn I fight
[1:25:24] it I'm this human but does it mean I'm
[1:25:31] not saved does it mean that that God has
[1:25:36] withdrawn his presence because it I've
[1:25:38] got a sickness
[1:25:43] no it just means I've said it probably
[1:25:45] needs I'm stubborn
[1:25:46] well I've part out my wife gone
[1:25:51] anybody realized she does cuz you know I
[1:25:55] don't tell you when I'm sick I don't
[1:25:57] tell her what I'm saying doesn't you
[1:26:01] know needs going around and talking
[1:26:02] about you sickness if I need to go
[1:26:05] doctor and it's bad enough I'll go you
[1:26:08] know but why tell everybody I'm sick bro
[1:26:12] from EMC and we all sick we all just in
[1:26:15] the same shape we're all ain't nothing
[1:26:17] ain't none of us this Christians cuz
[1:26:19] we're all sick now you just got out of
[1:26:22] the word now you say woman within when
[1:26:27] brother branham wouldn't was sick
[1:26:29] he would be taken out and when the Lord
[1:26:32] Jesus had a headache he'd be taken out
[1:26:34] so now you see what you were saying with
[1:26:36] it now why don't we live life like it is
[1:26:41] and say thank you that's why I said the
[1:26:43] other day why do we have to wait to get
[1:26:45] sick before we ask God to take care of
[1:26:47] us to not let sickness come on us why
[1:26:51] can't we pray before well brother John
[1:26:53] Martin I remember that years ago he said
[1:26:55] you don't have to wait to get sick to be
[1:26:56] praying for praying for 6:00 and pray
[1:26:58] for it before you get it the point
[1:27:02] it struck into me and that's what I do
[1:27:05] every day I thank him for healing me
[1:27:07] saving me keeping me forgiving me plain
[1:27:13] common sense too and a lot of things see
[1:27:21] I was thinking about it I'm thinking
[1:27:24] about God was so great to those
[1:27:26] Christians till he took every one of
[1:27:28] them out of Jerusalem before he would
[1:27:31] allow Tidus to come in and those little
[1:27:36] children laying there and snakes and
[1:27:38] things to know and yet they just for
[1:27:42] some reason those things turn away could
[1:27:49] it be that your angel is taking care of
[1:27:52] you
[1:27:53] I mean was that bull afraid of brother
[1:27:57] branham our wizard what was any or what
[1:28:05] was standing there which one was it
[1:28:12] that animal knew what was standing in
[1:28:14] front of it you know how I've made it
[1:28:17] I've made it to the point that I believe
[1:28:20] it see there for a moment
[1:28:23] nature saw its master in a man called
[1:28:28] William Brennan Hornets all of those
[1:28:33] things I think about him sometimes he
[1:28:37] said the other day he said Darrell
[1:28:38] Ward's apart they're mountains he said
[1:28:40] seventy miles from any human no advise
[1:28:45] me I'd cut it down to 50 you know at
[1:28:48] least but he said 70 miles from any
[1:28:53] civilization whatever hardly and he
[1:28:56] wasn't afraid
[1:28:59] what was he depending on he just build
[1:29:04] up the fire lay down at night and go
[1:29:07] what was he depending on now brother
[1:29:12] vesicles when the talking so it's
[1:29:14] up to him he said him and brother Anand
[1:29:16] was out hunting one day and city they
[1:29:18] had to fire and he said you go ahead and
[1:29:21] go to sleep and said how long no wait a
[1:29:26] minute he said I'll go to sleep brother
[1:29:27] rent him and you you set up then I'll
[1:29:29] take over after a while I believe that's
[1:29:30] where it goes and he he said he woke him
[1:29:33] up and or he got up you know and he said
[1:29:37] brother branham went over to lay down
[1:29:38] and said he sat down he said oppressors
[1:29:47] just hidden Gulf that place or the
[1:29:50] Prophet had been I believe that I
[1:29:54] believe that code us a witness to him
[1:29:59] being there to when you're not afraid
[1:30:05] when you have no fear fear is gone what
[1:30:09] are we gonna get to that when we're
[1:30:12] gonna get to the bases here we're not
[1:30:13] oh but I'm getting older well what do
[1:30:16] you think is supposed to happen to you I
[1:30:22] mean are we supposed to be getting older
[1:30:25] but look at our body that's getting
[1:30:26] younger you kind of put things ahead of
[1:30:28] time that's supposed to happen what
[1:30:30] these days but it ain't like we it ain't
[1:30:33] no vitamin we can take it ain't no
[1:30:36] something we can do to keep ourselves to
[1:30:39] that we're all subject to sicknesses and
[1:30:41] troubles and heartaches but it doesn't
[1:30:44] mean God has turned against us it could
[1:30:47] mean that he's allowing that to happen
[1:30:50] even to see how you will react what
[1:30:59] about it he said well that's kind of
[1:31:02] funny of you then but see I was thinking
[1:31:04] of this message how perfect God shows
[1:31:09] the church to be before he ever starts
[1:31:12] writing one word about her you know
[1:31:15] actually he shows how perfect she is in
[1:31:17] chapter 1 chapter 2 he starts telling
[1:31:20] them about their troubles and what they
[1:31:21] are and their problems you got the deeds
[1:31:25] of the Nicolaitans among you
[1:31:26] one of them was saying you hate that and
[1:31:29] I hate it too right while he say you got
[1:31:31] these things right but he's already told
[1:31:37] how perfect we are you realize when he
[1:31:41] gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] you're as perfect in your soul as you
[1:31:46] will ever be in life even when you get a
[1:31:49] change of the body all of the things it
[1:31:51] won't make that soul no more eternal
[1:31:56] well then how can why would I doubt him
[1:31:59] taking care of me yeah but brother Dale
[1:32:04] you're 78 years old you don't not be
[1:32:05] going down to deer hunting land 80 miles
[1:32:09] away go back in them woods and said I am
[1:32:11] I have a good time and I'm serious I
[1:32:15] love for people to hunt with me I do
[1:32:17] I'll
[1:32:18] Danny and Richard waited on him and all
[1:32:21] I got but you know what when I'm down

[1:32:24] about nobody
[1:32:26] well aren't you afraid you if I'll get
[1:32:28] hurt so what I'm sitting upon a deer
[1:32:33] standing one day about 15 feet off the
[1:32:34] ground and The Stand fell out from under
[1:32:37] me
[1:32:37] it just splitting with heart and as it
[1:32:41] did I had already flipped the governor
[1:32:43] why because I felt it moved I just
[1:32:45] flipped the gun to get rid of it and I
[1:32:47] went like that and when I did it was
[1:32:50] just perfect I grabbed a limb on that
[1:32:52] tree and just swung all the way around
[1:32:54] that tree brother for and he'd get that
[1:32:58] done I went all the way around that tree
[1:33:01] you know where my feet landed on the
[1:33:03] nail that had drove in the tree
[1:33:05] I walked down I went down and got my gun
[1:33:11] you said did you go home no the day
[1:33:13] wasn't over I was hunting I went down to
[1:33:18] the next stand and I jumped up down on
[1:33:20] it and made sure it's all right

[1:33:35] 60-month
[1:33:36] and it's so shielded the sound from that
[1:33:39] he didn't hardly even hear the gun go
[1:33:41] off with that gun went off that barrel
[1:33:44] that closed I'm telling the end of the
[1:33:45] burro I had lid and spark in my head and
[1:33:51] I couldn't hear period I couldn't hear
[1:33:56] he said what did you go get Terence and
[1:33:58] run to the house no I didn't want to

[1:34:14] I see when I said I better check to see
[1:34:16] where all the parts is that so I done my
[1:34:19] hand like this and I looked and had
[1:34:22] blood on the hand but I had enough
[1:34:24] knowledge that I knew if I had was
[1:34:26] blowed off if my hand was shrunk down
[1:34:28] any all right

[1:34:40] little bar and they was that piece of

[1:35:44] hospital will you get what I'm talking
[1:35:52] about
[1:35:52] well I be afraid thinking your life with
[1:35:56] the things you've been through and
[1:35:57] something happened the car wreck

[1:36:04] it on the screen really let them see it
[1:36:06] the whole front end is tore off the car
[1:36:09] it's spun totally around the whole back
[1:36:11] end is tore off the car even the truck
[1:36:13] that run over it it's all back up under
[1:36:16] the front end of the truck and she
[1:36:18] walked away
[1:36:25] asked Yas about it when the day he
[1:36:30] pulled some stupid tricks he tried to
[1:36:32] outrun a car and get in front and the
[1:36:37] car spun out with him and slapped up
[1:36:39] against the tree yeah he gets a help

[1:37:10] said we saw him walk away well then we
[1:37:15] news in that car right I believe in
[1:37:21] guardian angels
[1:37:22] I believe the angel of God hasn't kept
[1:37:24] about it but start with the Holy Spirit
[1:37:26] being your angel let him be your angel
[1:37:31] and then he has ministering spirits a
[1:37:33] sign for whatever we have need of and
[1:37:35] then we shouldn't be afraid fear hath
[1:37:41] torment I'll be afraid this standard

[1:37:47] hundred to see if all the parts with our

[1:38:58] three experiences I had when an angel or
[1:39:01] something was standing in the doorway
[1:39:03] looking at me and I grabbed a 357 pistol
[1:39:06] and went after it that's how real it was
[1:39:10] he said yeah it scared me to death
[1:39:14] but then after I realized the house was
[1:39:17] in how it was laid out there's no way he
[1:39:20] could get out and I went hunting for him
[1:39:23] I didn't find nobody second time a
[1:39:29] little easier it's still nervous little
[1:39:34] easier about it because he realized
[1:39:39] something's taking place that's
