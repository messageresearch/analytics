[3:06] Colossians
[3:08] 1 before we read his word the prophet of
[3:10] God one day said it like this and always
[3:13] stuck with me he said no man has a right
[3:16] to open a Bible or to read until he
[3:20] asked
[3:21] permission the author of the book amen
[3:24] so let's ask his permission
[3:27] father we truly thank you tonight
[3:30] for your love and your grace unto us
[3:33] thank you for an opportunity to come
[3:34] down and fellowship with our brothers

[3:39] have your way with what we would say
[3:40] tonight and forgive our sins lead us
[3:43] Lord in thy love and just let your light
[3:46] shine to each one of our hearts that we
[3:48] may see you teach us to wait Lord upon
[3:52] you and in Waiting then we will come to
[3:54] that place to work that you want us to
[3:57] be guide each one blessing little place
[4:01] Lord amen May there be a light shining
[4:03] protect it guide it Lord let it be in
[4:06] your love in Jesus name amen amen
[4:09] Colossians 1 be very familiar with all
[4:12] of
[4:12] uses that as we read God's word and just
[4:16] speak a little while Colossians
[4:18] 1:15 now we're going to speak
[4:22] on we're going to talk
[4:24] about the Christ of God the Christ of
[4:28] God you see the scripture read it oh but
[4:31] we want to lay down the foundation and
[4:33] then we'll be seated and we got a lot of
[4:34] scripture to read but I love to read his
[4:37] word that's just my way of doing it I
[4:40] love to read his word and and let you
[4:42] see what he said and that way he said
[4:44] that wasn't what brother Dale thought
[4:45] that's what the Bible say right verse 15
[4:48] said who is the image of the invisible
[4:50] God the firstborn of every creature for
[4:53] by him were all things created that are
[4:55] in heaven and that are in Earth visible
[4:58] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[5:00] dominions or principalities or Powers
[5:04] all things were created by Him and for
[5:06] him and he is before all things and by
[5:09] him all things consist right and he is
[5:11] the head of the body of the church who
[5:14] is the beginning the first born from the
[5:16] dead that in all things he might have
[5:18] the pre preeminence for it pleased the
[5:21] father that in him should all fullness
[5:24] dwell now we know who he talking about
[5:26] the Lord Jesus Christ right let's just
[5:28] drop down to verse vers uh 26 to say the
[5:32] reading between even the
[5:35] mystery which has been hid from the ages
[5:37] and for Generations but now is made
[5:40] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[5:43] make known what is the riches of the
[5:45] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[5:50] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[5:54] you may be
[5:57] seated now I said I want to just take a
[6:01] little
[6:02] thought and just talk
[6:05] about we say we believe in one true and
[6:07] living God yes and we're not
[6:11] Trinity but we don't go that route
[6:13] that's right and and we're not oness
[6:16] because we don't go into that route
[6:17] that's right so the truth is uh
[6:22] somewhere in between the two that went
[6:24] one one way and one the other and the
[6:26] truth lies between well the truth is
[6:29] that there is there just one true and
[6:30] living
[6:32] God and the Lord Jesus Christ is that
[6:35] God now when I get down in a little
[6:37] while and start talking and when I talk
[6:41] about the
[6:42] Christ when I talk about the Christ or
[6:45] if I say Jesus Christ now I'm I'm
[6:49] telling you up front so you know let
[6:51] your mind be to where you'll remember
[6:53] this that don't uh think that I'm
[6:56] talking about the flesh that flesh had a
[6:59] begin about 2,000 years ago to fulfill
[7:03] the scriptures Hebrews 10:5 a body thou
[7:05] H has prepared for me all right the
[7:08] prophet of God said in body he was a man
[7:13] that's right but said in Soul he was God
[7:17] all right well that's the one we're
[7:18] talking about the one true and living
[7:20] God yes sir okay then that way then he
[7:23] was born
[7:25] Emmanuel God With Us that's right uhhuh
[7:29] he he was born Lord the
[7:32] Christ so then we we we lay it down and
[7:35] just think about it that who he is and
[7:38] and where he is and that's what we want
[7:40] to do so if you'd like to I I like to go
[7:43] in the scriptures and look at something
[7:45] so let's go to
[7:47] Matthew and we're talking about this one
[7:49] that we call the Lord Jesus Christ as I
[7:52] said now if I say Jesus Christ or Christ
[7:56] I'm not meaning the flesh amen
[7:59] everybody everybody got my point and I'm
[8:02] not meaning the flesh if I mean flesh
[8:05] I'll tell you about the flesh but I'm
[8:07] meaning the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir
[8:09] brother almighty God Amen cuz I asked my
[8:12] church a question years ago and and I
[8:16] hold on here I asked my church years ago
[8:18] a question and I said when you think of
[8:21] the Son of God I said when is what do
[8:24] you think of and they said well 2,000
[8:27] years ago you know and I said well
[8:30] that's fine but I said according to the
[8:33] Bible and according to the prophet's
[8:35] message right that the son of lot the
[8:39] Son of God was the Loos that come out of
[8:41] God in the beginning
[8:43] absolutely that's why he's called the
[8:45] Christ yes that was the way of doing it
[8:49] you know because that way you you you
[8:51] keep it to the Christ yes and then you
[8:53] can follow that that's what we want to
[8:55] follow through the Bible but I want to
[8:57] First establish who it was was that was
[9:01] there that we read about oh yes and let
[9:03] the gospels declare him to be who he
[9:06] Isel look at Matthew very familiar with
[9:08] all us Matthew
[9:12] 16 the Lord and we'll read this from
[9:15] Matthew Mark Luke and
[9:18] John we're going to read the same thing
[9:22] and I want what I want you to watch is
[9:24] that each one of them describes him
[9:29] uh and they all totally
[9:32] compare to say the same thing that's
[9:35] right but each one will maybe one will
[9:37] say a little bit more than the other
[9:40] that's right and that's why I like it
[9:42] because see if Matthew said it Mark said
[9:45] it exactly the same all the writings
[9:47] Luke said all of it just all the
[9:49] writings John would say all of it U it
[9:52] would there would be no need of having
[9:55] Matthew Mark luk and John that's right
[9:57] you you would just have one yes but if
[9:59] you'll notice then you got as the
[10:01] prophet of God taught
[10:04] us that you got your Lon the ox of man
[10:07] and the eagle the combat Beach yes sir
[10:09] all right so he says line Matthew see
[10:13] Mark o y man Luke uhuh and Eagle John
[10:19] that's right and if you'll read in your
[10:21] scriptures you'll see that each one of
[10:23] them is explaining the same person but
[10:27] yet they're using their own human
[10:29] ability sometime and wording to express
[10:32] that from and I love that yes all right
[10:35] so then you'll find that in like in in
[10:38] Mark you'll find the Mark 16 you know
[10:42] about laying hands on the sick you find
[10:44] a lot of healing things all right Luke
[10:48] you'll find he's more or less like he's
[10:50] he's using the shrewdness of a man to
[10:53] break down who this is that's right and
[10:55] Luke is the only one and remember Luke
[10:58] was not an original disciple no that's
[11:00] right right he comes on with Paul all
[11:03] right he's not one of the
[11:05] original all right so you do it but look
[11:08] at look he says having
[11:11] perfect
[11:14] understanding and he was the only one
[11:15] that said it that way that's right but
[11:17] then you get to John John is more
[11:20] prophetic right bringing in to show you
[11:23] the prophetic side of almighty God keep
[11:26] that in mind now as we go along look at
[11:29] man Matthew 16 very familiar with us
[11:32] verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast
[11:34] of cesaria Philippi guessed his
[11:36] disciples saying who do men say that I
[11:38] the son of
[11:39] man and they said and they said some say
[11:43] that thou John the Baptist some El
[11:45] another J M are one of the Apostles one
[11:47] of the prophets excuse me and he said to
[11:50] them but whom say ye that I am and Simon
[11:54] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[11:57] Christ the son of the Living God
[12:01] right now Jesus went on to tell him said
[12:03] now my father is the one that had to
[12:06] reveal that to you yes brother R in
[12:09] reference to that he even said it this
[12:11] way he said Jesus was saying my own
[12:15] life right did not reveal that unto you
[12:19] that's right see it took the holy spirit
[12:21] cuz he's the only revealer of the world
[12:23] right all right now go over to mark
[12:34] okay and when they compare totally we
[12:37] just read to verse 29 all right because
[12:40] basically what the others are
[12:42] saying and he say unto them but whom say
[12:45] ye that I am Peter answered and said
[12:48] unto him Thou Art the
[12:51] Christ all right now so what do we got
[12:55] over here
[12:56] now Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[13:00] Living
[13:02] God whereas Mark he just more or less
[13:04] shortens it to the bases that D the
[13:08] Christ
[13:10] yes okay now pick up
[13:14] Luke which is Luke
[13:23] 9 we'll read this 18 and 19 and 20 and
[13:27] it came to pass as he was a long praying
[13:30] see that's a little different from the
[13:32] saying of the other so it's not
[13:34] something that you say well well one of
[13:36] them is contrary to the other one no
[13:38] it's four different men
[13:41] writing of the situation of life around
[13:44] them at the time but each one of them is
[13:47] led by the Holy Spirit to to publicly
[13:52] pronounce or deire who this one is
[13:55] absolutely now as far as their their
[13:57] small amount of their words and May
[13:59] different in the wording right yes sir
[14:01] but their pronunciation or their
[14:03] statement they make of him is all the
[14:05] same oh yes but came to pass that he was
[14:08] aone praying his disciples were with him
[14:10] and he asked him say whom say the people
[14:13] that I am yep and they answer and said
[14:17] John the Baptist but some say El and
[14:19] others say that one of the old prophets
[14:21] is risen again see that's not listed in
[14:24] some of the other but it's still the
[14:26] same right and he said to them but whom
[14:29] say ye that I am y Peter answering said
[14:32] the Christ of God oh my listen
[14:37] yes Hallelujah but is there any
[14:39] difference in saying the Christ or the
[14:42] Christ the son of the Living God or the
[14:46] Christ of God right right amen is there
[14:50] any difference in the no it's just
[14:53] different ways of expressing
[14:57] it if you'll notice in the in the
[14:59] writings you'll find that uh one of the
[15:02] gospels gives uh one blind
[15:06] man one of the other gospels gives two
[15:08] Blind Men so people say look like
[15:12] contradiction
[15:14] no one of
[15:16] them saw
[15:18] one he didn't see the other one the
[15:21] other one saw
[15:23] two and you got to remember that if it's
[15:27] Luke that's writing who claims to have
[15:30] perfect understanding by the Holy Spirit
[15:33] remember Luke is having to take what
[15:35] somebody says yes right that's right so
[15:39] then there one seeing one and one seeing
[15:41] two that make
[15:44] contradictions see people do that to try
[15:46] to make make it a lie and fail to get
[15:48] that each one of them is describing who
[15:52] Jesus Christ is to them that's right and
[15:57] from the Revelation they're receiving
[15:59] so Luke here says he's the Christ of God
[16:03] yes all right let's go over to John now
[16:05] and then we'll get into more our
[16:08] thought John
[16:18] 6 verse
[16:20] 67 then said Jesus unto the
[16:24] 12 will you also go away now that's not
[16:27] listed in Matthew Mark Luke
[16:34] but that doesn't make it a
[16:37] contradiction that makes each one of
[16:39] them see in a different
[16:41] situation and then describing it and
[16:44] sometimes now if you know the history of
[16:46] the writing of the Bible basically uh in
[16:49] other words they wasn't going along as
[16:51] Jesus said something and they pin it
[16:53] down P it down
[16:54] no that's right that wasn't what they
[16:57] done no it's a long about ad50 oh my
[17:02] which was almost 20 years after the
[17:04] death of Christ right that that they
[17:06] started really writing
[17:09] down the records and
[17:11] things and you know it it wasn't that
[17:14] they were just going along writing it
[17:16] down look he done this he they were
[17:18] doing the most of it by memory but
[17:21] remember the memory could not be
[17:23] different absolutely from the god of the
[17:25] world absolutely so then God truly was
[17:28] the
[17:29] if they were writing it down you could
[17:31] see it as one thing maybe but I'd rather
[17:34] have it the way it come out because that
[17:36] way it came out by the Holy Spirit
[17:38] leading Matthew to write Mark to write
[17:41] Luke to write after hearing from and
[17:44] John really Mark was not an original
[17:47] right oh we only have Matthew and and
[17:50] John but Mark and Luke were not original
[17:52] disciples right so they were getting
[17:54] there from other things but the holy
[17:57] spirit is perfect in the way it say
[18:00] amen all right cuz they were describing
[18:02] who they saw
[18:03] right all right now John what did you
[18:06] see then said Jesus unto the 12 will you
[18:10] go will you also go
[18:13] away then Simon Peter answered him Lord
[18:16] to whom shall we go that's right watch
[18:19] what he
[18:19] says Thou Hast the
[18:22] words of eternal
[18:25] life we got a description in ain't that
[18:28] prophetic yes we we're talking about the
[18:30] Eagles see right the anointing
[18:34] Ministry and we believe and our
[18:38] sure that thou art that Christ oh L amen
[18:44] yes sir notice that in your scripture
[18:45] now thank you
[18:47] Father thou art that Christ right the
[18:51] son of the Living God
[18:54] yes now you think about it
[19:00] when it says th that Christ
[19:03] Y in other words he's prophetic in
[19:06] stating that there's no way to be
[19:08] anything else other than what you are
[19:11] Abol
[19:12] absolutely
[19:14] oh you're that Christ yes now who was
[19:18] that Christ
[19:21] oh right oh that's the point yes he
[19:25] emphasized the word that uhhuh
[19:29] so then what he's saying is is the same
[19:32] thing Matthew was saying same Peter said
[19:36] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[19:39] Living God all right here then John
[19:43] picking up Peter's
[19:46] answer and Peter is saying thou art that
[19:49] Christ
[19:50] yes oh the one that was to come
[19:54] yes and that Christ
[19:58] right all right now we're not talking
[20:02] about anointed ones of that word Christ
[20:06] yes okay cuz the word anointing means
[20:09] Christ and back and forth that's right
[20:11] but there's only one God
[20:13] right and there's only one Christ am
[20:18] yes amen and that would have to be Jesus
[20:22] Christ so what was Peter saying what was
[20:25] the Revelation that he got oh yes
[20:29] yes if you remember and read on down in
[20:31] Matthew you'll hear
[20:34] this flesh and blood is not revealed
[20:37] that unto thee but my Father which is in
[20:38] heaven but if you go back and read above
[20:41] that you'll see Jesus is
[20:44] asking who do Man say I the son of man
[20:51] am yes sir Peter never got the
[20:54] Revelation oh this right right of what
[20:57] God was asking right that's right but he
[21:00] got what was for the
[21:02] time because he said Upon This Rock I'll
[21:04] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[21:07] cannot Prevail against this revelation
[21:10] of God see the son of man according to
[21:13] Luke 17 oh my yes would be coming in the
[21:17] end time mhm he knew he was the son of
[21:21] man yes he did oh but he had to build a
[21:24] church upon the rock yes which is Christ
[21:27] to reveal word that's right now so then
[21:31] that would be that if we believe the
[21:34] Bible that if we believe
[21:38] that Hebrews 13:8 is
[21:43] correct
[21:46] then he's Jesus Christ the same
[21:49] yesterday
[21:51] today and forever right see that's why
[21:54] you can't
[21:56] have all of these doctrines and ideas of
[21:59] God here in the end time that are
[22:01] running so
[22:03] wrong because it won't fit Hebrews 13:8
[22:06] right because if he ever was God he
[22:09] would have to be God and he have to
[22:11] always be God if he was ever the Christ
[22:14] he have to be Christ he has to always be
[22:16] the Christ absolutely that's right you
[22:20] see my point th AR the Christ yes so we
[22:24] got a great Revelation in he oh praise
[22:28] God yes he got the
[22:30] Revelation that's right Peter was
[22:33] actually
[22:36] saying you
[22:39] are that Christ
[22:44] am that Christ that always
[22:49] existed you are the
[22:52] Creator right are you listening right
[22:55] Peter was actually declaring
[22:59] that God had revealed to him that inside
[23:02] of that human body was standing the very
[23:06] almighty God right that created the
[23:11] world you can't have another Creator no
[23:14] you can't all right and we read there in
[23:17] Colossians and all things were created
[23:19] by Him by
[23:21] who by Jesus Christ it said abely I say
[23:26] it where you won't get mixed up not
[23:27] Jesus the flesh but the flesh wouldn't
[23:29] bti Sirus Christ that's why we don't
[23:32] believe in Eternal sunship that's right
[23:34] that's right right that's right you
[23:37] don't believe that no sir you can't have
[23:39] the sunship existing in the form of
[23:42] Flesh that's
[23:44] right right but he was the Creator God
[23:48] yes right John 1 1-3
[23:53] says that all things were made by him
[23:55] you know in the beginning was work work
[23:57] God work was God work we going through
[23:59] but we failed to watch most of the time
[24:01] when he say and all things were made by
[24:03] him and without him was not anything
[24:05] made that was made that's right
[24:09] brother who was the maker Jesus Christ
[24:13] he the son of the Living God true the
[24:16] one the prophet in the the questions and
[24:18] answers of Genesis said it was like a
[24:21] little Halo of light went
[24:23] out oh yes he said it's like the father
[24:27] there and said like a son playing before
[24:29] the door
[24:31] yeah this little Halo of Life called a
[24:34] little go theop all those big words that
[24:37] we talk about but break it down into
[24:39] simple
[24:41] terminology we don't believe in many
[24:43] gods but we believe that God can change
[24:47] his form right that's according to
[24:49] scripture in Colossians that's right he
[24:51] can change his form yes he can to where
[24:54] he can appear in different forms all
[24:56] right so then what do he just changed
[24:59] his form and stepped over into the
[25:03] word and begin to create the same God
[25:07] yes he did not another God oh sir this
[25:10] was not the prophet said God creating
[25:12] Jesus and Jesus creating everything else
[25:15] he said that make him less than godhead
[25:17] absolutely y so that can't be so he was
[25:21] the Creator God or are we're all Mally
[25:24] confused that's right listen amen so
[25:28] John declares it and says all things
[25:31] were made by him yes oh my Hebrews 1 1
[25:35] and 2 thank you Father God speaking in
[25:38] Su town and diverse manners in the
[25:41] prophets by the prophets in is the
[25:44] correct right sir in the prophets right
[25:48] then he comes down to the lights says
[25:50] these light spoken to us by his son by
[25:53] whom also he made the world
[25:58] yep read that Hebrews 13 there yes or 1
[26:01] 2 right right now let's turn over to
[26:06] Ephesians because we done cover
[26:07] Colossians that all things were created
[26:09] by Him oh praise God let's turn to
[26:14] Ephesians and just read what it says
[26:16] about this
[26:17] one Ephesians
[26:23] 3 who is the
[26:26] creator right
[26:30] verse
[26:33] n and to make all men see what is the
[26:37] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[26:39] beginning of the world have been hided
[26:43] God who created All Things by Jesus
[26:48] Christ right oh my listen all right now
[26:52] so then Jesus Christ had to be almighty
[26:56] God and not Jesus the flesh
[26:58] you don't get your
[27:00] M Jesus the
[27:02] Christ that's why did you go over in the
[27:05] book of Acts and you'll find in the the
[27:08] message that um was bringing there I
[27:10] believe it was by it was Peter once
[27:12] bringing it and you'll find out that he
[27:15] was the one that spoke to Moses from the
[27:16] burning
[27:17] bshs who the Christ amen who was the
[27:22] angel of the Covenant amen Paul declares
[27:25] it was Christ yes absolutely
[27:29] yes Christ was the angel of the C who
[27:30] was the pillar of fire that led the
[27:32] children of Israel that's right the
[27:35] Bible declares it was the Christ
[27:37] yes oh yes the Christ of God yes that
[27:41] Christ yes oh the one who was back gued
[27:44] said let there be yes God in another
[27:46] form yes the prophet of God said when it
[27:49] come time for man and we had sinned upon
[27:51] the Earth he said God couldn't send a
[27:55] son he said you wouldn't do that would
[27:58] you send one of your children to die or
[28:00] would you come yourself that's right
[28:02] amen he said he would not do that he
[28:04] said he came himself he said he just
[28:06] changed his form oh yes amen and he just
[28:10] stepped over that's why the people can't
[28:12] understand it see that's why the Trinity
[28:13] is wrong because You' have free running
[28:15] the r and then they'd be arguing over
[28:17] who done the Crea and what went on
[28:19] that's right
[28:21] oh and you leave the father out of the
[28:23] creation because the son would be the
[28:26] Creator but if the son was God himself
[28:28] the father made manifest in another form
[28:31] yes listen then it's the same true and
[28:33] living
[28:34] godr yes sir brother see then when he
[28:37] stood here on the shores of Galilee he
[28:39] was Christ the same yesterday today
[28:41] forever yes he was amen that's why he
[28:44] can stand there and say before Abraham
[28:45] was I am oh yes thank God yes y amen he

[29:13] a man who stand up there and the Bible
[29:15] said he talk to God lip to lip in other
[29:18] words face to face he and then he turns
[29:21] right around in another next few verses

[29:46] time that wasn't Christ telling him to
[29:47] do that that's right Christ told him to
[29:49] strike it the first time who wasn't in
[29:52] all those prophets that were speaking to
[29:53] mankind amen
[29:56] oh who was it when when brother R gets
[29:58] over in Exodus 32 about 32 right 30 32
[30:02] when he gets into that situation where
[30:04] there that Moses you know the children
[30:07] of Israel have sinned against God and
[30:09] made the golden caves and the thing and
[30:11] Moses come up to the place and he says

[30:19] make some kind of atonement and we w't
[30:22] get on that tonight oh you might get
[30:24] that tomorrow cuz all I want to ask you

[31:13] Moses that stood up there and said take
[31:15] my life that was Christ inside of the
[31:17] man but the man was human but he
[31:20] submitted himself he was willing to die
[31:23] for his people yes he was it's like

[32:57] face and he came off
[32:58] when he was speak he said he was God to
[33:01] the people he said when he stepped back
[33:03] he become Moses about because he was a
[33:06] man right yes but in the presence of the

[34:38] Pillar of Fire would move oh yes and the
[34:41] cloud by day would move the children of
[34:43] Israel would move in it amen
[34:47] thank at the words of a
[34:51] man God would

[39:04] you a new birth oh yes Hall see that
[39:08] makes in Hebrews 13 that's not another
[39:10] God another situation that's where you w
[39:13] this
[39:14] Miss see your Trinity we know they were
[39:16] wrong CU it can't be true right but the
[39:19] oness see they hold that Oneness Oneness
[39:22] Oneness but go find you want and ask
[39:25] him he'll tell you brother R will tell
[39:28] you that oness is one like your
[39:32] finger abely go find you one brother s
[39:35] he went found any one
[39:38] yes he found somebody that could
[39:42] express you know what a one this
[39:44] Doctrine is when that Jesus was the life
[39:48] form of God right that's a one this doct
[39:52] that's correct Jesus they believe was
[39:55] the life form
[39:58] of God y now I don't believe that amen I
[40:02] believe the bride is the life form of
[40:06] God because it's Christ in you the hope
[40:09] of
[40:11] glory not another God not another
[40:13] thought and idea right amen is Christ
[40:16] Living in you right yes it is oh my
[40:20] speaking brother said God wants to use
[40:22] you Amen to
[40:24] speak that's right to the people y
[40:29] you go out and you testify to somebody
[40:31] what do you think it's
[40:34] doing if it's really right now if you're
[40:36] just trying your best to convince them
[40:37] that's not Christ that's right that's
[40:40] you and a little bit of God I say it
[40:43] that way because you do have some truth
[40:45] yes yeah you want to go out and do it
[40:48] yeah but when you really
[40:49] l oh my now listen heard of a man in the
[40:53] church one time and won call where it
[40:54] was because they might not want it
[40:56] because it was told at our church
[40:59] but this man was R driving down the road
[41:01] one day he looked over and he seen this
[41:04] woman walking down the
[41:07] highway and he knew what she
[41:10] was she was a
[41:15] prostitute he pulled over to the side
[41:17] and roll down the
[41:20] window and he said how much for your
[41:22] time
[41:28] she said so
[41:30] much he said crawl
[41:35] in she got in the car and he handed her
[41:38] the
[41:40] money he went
[41:43] parked stopped the
[41:46] car said I have your time yes yes he
[41:51] said I want to talk to you about your
[41:53] soul am he said God spoke to me told me
[41:58] to talk to you prise
[42:01] God you know she scared of death
[42:06] then she'd never heard nothing like that
[42:09] right in her business she's in she'
[42:11] never heard nobody talk like that right
[42:14] but you know in a little bit she became
[42:16] under
[42:19] conviction and came to church got amen
[42:23] that's right
[42:29] I'm just wondering do we really know the
[42:31] voice of
[42:33] God y right well see Satan can tell us
[42:37] sure especially now after we hear the
[42:38] story yes see Satan can tell you walk
[42:41] you know would stop you remember R
[42:44] random saw this young girl walking down
[42:45] the road about 16 years old didn't have
[42:48] many clothes on twist
[42:50] anyway he said I'll go back and talk to
[42:53] her the holy spirit said you do and
[42:54] you'll be arrested
[42:59] y so you got to know it's God it's got
[43:03] to be Christ yes if it's Christ it'll be
[43:06] right yes oh God wor about it that's
[43:09] right but is God still talking amen sir
[43:13] I believe he's talking to his bride
[43:15] she's the last form now the the 144,000
[43:18] will be the form of God after we leave
[43:21] right so it's all not over with that's
[43:23] why they told me when I first came into
[43:24] the mission they told me it said
[43:26] Redemption was over 60
[43:27] 3 and I said well I'm sorry I don't
[43:30] claim the Holy Ghost but I didn't claim
[43:32] it just because I come into the mission
[43:33] I seen I didn't have it because of the
[43:35] Prophet the way he was expressing it and
[43:37] I mean I was a deacon at 23 years of age
[43:39] I was teaching adult Sunday School
[43:41] classes when I left which was the
[43:43] deacons and elders and they their F you
[43:45] know them the older people but I saw
[43:47] that I didn't have the baptism of the
[43:48] Holy Ghost well don't you think it's
[43:50] something when I come into the message
[43:52] and the first thing they told me said
[43:53] you can't be saved got 63
[43:58] I said well according to the prophet and
[43:59] the way he says things is one thing but
[44:02] I
[44:02] said you know according to my Bible is
[44:06] what a call see I had a good decent
[44:08] memory of the Bible I had more of it
[44:10] then than I have now cuz I've lost a lot
[44:12] of it
[44:13] but I said according to my Bible
[44:16] Redemption was over before the world
[44:18] ever begun amen that's right yes sir but
[44:21] all names were written in the lamb book
[44:23] of life before the foundation of that's
[44:25] right I said you're telling me that I
[44:28] that redemption's over you see that was
[44:30] the point I was getting I said even
[44:31] after we leave out of here people when I
[44:34] told him I said there is a Redemption
[44:36] going to Israel the 144,000 will be the
[44:40] form of God for the period in time and
[44:42] even that the white Throne judgment the
[44:45] foolish virgins and those people will be
[44:47] given eternal life do you agree amen
[44:50] then Redemption is not over until all
[44:52] die that's right brother amen let nobody
[44:55] don't run around say one said Don't
[44:57] listen to man
[44:59] s listen to God that's right you see I
[45:03] was 2 years before I received the
[45:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost yes reading
[45:08] six books a day and listening to two
[45:09] takes oh yes I had a wonderful job and a
[45:13] great opportunity not just packing
[45:15] everything I could
[45:17] get brother Dale you you say you didn't
[45:19] have a that no I didn't I knew I didn't
[45:21] I knew I was justified and Sanctified
[45:23] because I heard what the prophet had to
[45:24] say and I knew that that person that he
[45:27] was speaking of was not in my heart oh
[45:29] listen yes church because I saw that
[45:32] person when I was 11 years old standing
[45:34] in a church Lord that I wanted that God
[45:39] in my
[45:42] heart see God is still
[45:44] talking yes he is he's still speaking
[45:47] through his bride where he really wanted
[45:49] to
[45:51] be oh
[45:53] god oh when we say when that which is
[45:56] perfect is come that's which is part has
[45:58] done away we know that's not doing away
[46:00] with the gospel right that's right amen
[46:03] it's coming to Perfection but you know
[46:05] what I believe that which is perfect I'm
[46:07] looking at
[46:08] it I've been preaching eight or nine
[46:10] sermons already on perfect oh God yes
[46:13] Hallelujah on the word
[46:16] perfect I'm looking at perfect amen this
[46:19] is the Perfection that's coming to
[46:21] change our bodies this is where we can
[46:24] actually stand in the in the last days
[46:26] and the ch abolutely these bodies can be
[46:29] changed Martin Luther couldn't do that
[46:31] Wesley couldn't do it they could not do
[46:35] that it takes the word to bring that
[46:37] which is
[46:39] PR John in what we read in there said
[46:42] thou H has the words of eternal
[46:45] life that's right he knew he didn't have
[46:48] eternal life but he knew he was standing
[46:50] before one that even is worth was
[46:53] eternal
[46:55] life what about you and I amen that's
[46:58] right Paul said Christ in
[47:00] you the hope oh what is he said that's
[47:06] right hallu you doubt I mean just a
[47:13] hope when you receive the new
[47:15] birth you reach the condition in
[47:18] existence that you realize right I have
[47:22] eternal life in my soul that's right but
[47:24] I wonder about this body cuz that's what
[47:27] we used to do we used to all teach and
[47:28] get us a new body they still doing that
[47:30] in the M but still teaching get a new
[47:33] body that's thir is the same mind I
[47:35] ain't got time to F
[47:37] with you see according to my Bible my
[47:40] Prophet Jesus even raised R nail Prince
[47:42] and his body so it must be the same one
[47:45] amen that's what the prophet said and
[47:46] what the Bible said sir
[47:49] amen but you see they don't believe that
[47:53] God is great enough to redeem this oh my
[47:56] why why if he can put it in the
[47:58] soul why can't he bring it out into the
[48:01] body right if he can heal this body yep
[48:04] why can he not give it eternal life
[48:07] that's we got to go to the one that's
[48:09] got eternal life absolutely absolutely
[48:13] we got to go to the source of eternal
[48:14] life
[48:16] amen that's what John
[48:18] declared thou Hast the words of eternal
[48:22] life you are the
[48:25] Christ you are allight God
[48:28] hallelujah and Jesus
[48:31] is that brings a hope when you receive
[48:35] the new birth yes that's right come on
[48:38] that's what Paul's talking about
[48:39] absolutely when you receive the new
[48:41] birth in this age now the ages down
[48:45] through there they could only have a
[48:46] hope of redemption that's right are you
[48:49] listening yes Luther and them they
[48:52] couldn't teach to change of the body
[48:53] because they didn't know right now they
[48:55] can read the Bible yes but it not been
[48:57] revealed unto him so they were dealing
[49:00] with a hope
[49:02] yes but that hope make us not ashame
[49:05] that word hope doesn't mean hope yeah
[49:08] look it up it doesn't mean that it's the
[49:11] same word as Faith yes oh my it's just
[49:14] the way you're saying it yes because the
[49:16] new birth brings you in this day a hope
[49:19] yes it did an understanding that these
[49:21] bodies can be changed how by the Christ
[49:24] that's inside of us amen amen
[49:27] Oh Glory yes so then he was that Christ
[49:31] yes he was and he's still that Christ he
[49:34] who is it to you brother there he's that
[49:36] Christ amen that's right he's that
[49:38] Christ that spoke the world he's that
[49:40] Christ that guided the children of
[49:41] Israel he's that Christ that can tell
[49:43] God a better way of doing so and God
[49:45] listen to him amen oh he's that
[49:51] Christ and who are you
[49:56] Christ in you then who are you uhhuh
[49:58] come
[49:59] on come on folks I think spending a lot
[50:02] of time think about it who are
[50:05] you come
[50:08] on right you are that
[50:12] Christ amen hallelujah what Christ the
[50:16] Christ is going to take a change in the
[50:17] body amen yes
[50:20] absolutely the Christ is going to bring
[50:22] us to a change Resurrection ra the Dead
[50:28] I told my church probably 30 years ago
[50:30] or more I said the way I see it there's
[50:32] going to be a lot of people have to die
[50:33] before the change you know the moment
[50:35] the twinkle an eye the change comes I
[50:37] snap my finger where you mean see what I
[50:39] mean the moment the twinkle of an
[50:41] eye a say they're not in going to be in
[50:43] the Rapture no way but I said there'll
[50:45] be a lot of people go by the
[50:48] grave because they won't be able to
[50:50] stand to take that chain because they
[50:52] won't see who that Christ is
[50:57] Buried one just the other day and we
[50:58] sprinkled his IES I told my wife 20
[51:01] years ago or old I
[51:04] said Don come
[51:07] back he back and went I had problems but
[51:12] I said he'll come back that's right
[51:17] before the
[51:21] end he came back amen I think God still
[51:25] speaking amen you think that was your
[51:28] idea when I stood and told him my son
[51:31] back there would be come to the
[51:33] Lord all the years and he back to Liv
[51:36] and I kept telling everybody else he's
[51:37] com that's

[51:46] was talking about it I said Danny Choice
[51:48] has coming forget it oh I mean Danny's
[51:51] coming I told Joy I said Danny's coming
[51:53] right I said forget
[51:55] it and you know what he fell off a
[51:57] chicken house might got killed you know
[52:00] what he's the church
[52:01] today oh my yes that's right you see I
[52:06] kept telling him my son's coming cuz God
[52:08] showed me you know what he showed me the
[52:09] Bible says you'll be there with your
[52:10] Offspring yep right that's what the
[52:13] Bible says Y and every time I see that I
[52:16] mind I said that's me that's me he's
[52:19] talking to
[52:22] me then he came back to the Lord I went
[52:25] to my wife from d and said
[52:27] there's more to the story now she said
[52:30] what I said you going to be standing in
[52:31] pooping preaching with

[52:46] right amen yes sir you know you don't
[52:48] think about it a lot of times but you're
[52:50] doing a lot of speaking yourself that's
[52:52] right
[52:54] true you know like
[52:57] yes why don't she just
[53:01] speak I don't have any problems with
[53:04] telling somebody the Lord told me
[53:06] something and then it don't come to B
[53:09] Butz I would say the Lord didn't tell me
[53:11] that that's what the Bible said I said
[53:13] it
[53:14] presly but if I said it in it comes to P
[53:17] then it wouldn't me anyway that's right
[53:19] it was the Christ absolutely the same
[53:22] one that said let there be light yes

[53:29] will be in the ministry beside of you oh

[53:38] that but you see we doubt
[53:41] it
[53:43] right something comes to you your
[53:45] thought comes to
[53:47] you and you doubt it
[53:53] why when not speaking amen oh yes
[53:57] but I've never been one like this now
[53:59] I'm not one that I'm straight on what
[54:01] I'm saying I I don't believe in speaking
[54:03] something that takes 100 years for it to
[54:06] come to p and another generation does
[54:08] yeah I don't believe in that right God
[54:11] tells you it's going to come to P come
[54:13] amen that's right and it'll come pass
[54:16] your lifetime and you're do it
[54:19] Y and it ain't well I think somebody in

[54:40] right that's why they done that with
[54:42] brother R see and he said one of these
[54:44] days I'll show you that wasn't right

[54:49] would stand up there into discernment
[54:51] and things he said that would have been
[54:52] used to start with he said but it
[54:54] exposed the other
[54:58] why cuz God don't have to have none of
[55:00] that that's right he says it that's it I
[55:04] believe he's still talking amen I
[55:06] believe he Hebrews 138 that's right amen
