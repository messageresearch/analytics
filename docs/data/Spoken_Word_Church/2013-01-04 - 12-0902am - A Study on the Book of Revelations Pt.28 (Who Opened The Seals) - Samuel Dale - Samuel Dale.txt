all in the traveling back home pray that the Lord would bless we love you and we thank you just have your way you come and speak to our hearts and our lives in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John the by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now we go to First Peter 1 ver9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now written unto you how excuse me they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven which things the Angels desired to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober in hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word if some of the brothers would give these quotes out I wanted to make sure this to you know I want to try to finish up the part that I'm talking on this and and just to uh get it you know into your hearts and thinking about what I'm saying and then God has to reveal it because that's one thing I believe I believe no man can reveal anything even Jesus said by quoting the prophet that my own life didn't reveal that unto thee it takes the father to reveal it so it's going to take the Holy Spirit to reveal the word or or we won't get it see we can have the letter of the word we can read it and say well we understand we can have the quotes from The Prophet to say well here's what the prophet said but that still doesn't make it a revelation I tried to emphasize that unto us to where that we could could see and and and get a better understanding we had a real good time last night at the at the Bible study and we were on justification and we didn't get into any of the uh of the scriptures basically uh we will take that up at the next uh meeting but you know about justification but I was just mainly talking about you know your time you repented and ask God to forgive you because that's where justification starts starts where you repented of your sins you ask God to forgive you that starts a work in you that's justification chopping off you P sins the prophet said future home said it does nothing to the nature or anything of you it just chops off that sin when we tried to bring that in last night and then we did pick up a little bit to get up to uh justification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother U Joe will make you a copy if you desire of the uh Bible study so that you can listen to it you know all right but just pray that the Lord would guide us on them more because we'll be trying to to go into that later now we've been talking about the you know the Book of Revelations and we got into where we were trying to bring which was actually to to bring us to the to the uh fifth chapter and bringing us to that CH fifth chapter we've come to a place and spent quite a time uh talking about these things that are are made known and and we can see that you know the bride this the fifth chapter is the bride in glory after the Rapture all right and then from that then we went on to try to pick up some of the things and bring them to you and I chose today to just give you the quotes and that way then you know once I go along into the other parts of the seals and the things then you would have the quotes in front of you are keep keep it in front of you I would invite you to bring these quotes back with you and stick them in your Bible or something to you know to be able to when I say something then you won't be confused cuz you'll know that we already this has already been covered you know in our understanding now in doing that then let's just pick up where the Prophet said chapter 5 I I've spent quite a lengthy time now this is a 20 we finished 27 messages on this and uh you know I pray that it's been helpful to you uh it has to me to speak on it and we spoke most of these quotes that we're going to give you to start with are quotes that we have given over and over and over throughout the message that we've been trying to bring over all of these these sermons and then doing that then let's just look at what the prophet had to say go ahead and pull up brother Anderson number one under the quotes these brothers are getting so good until someone's coming out of the offices now to get sit out out here and enjoy the fellowship out here you know we really appreciate them and appreciate them the fact that they'll be going with us to be able to help us on the Daniel 70 weeks we wish we could take everybody but uh we don't have actually the authority to bring too many with us but we've asked permission to bring the technicians with us to where that we could put it up in you know and take her own videos and things and and making what do you call those big old words I never have do it's a PowerPoint you know they call that a PowerPoint you know you make a PowerPoint well I make a PowerPoint the whole time I'm just pointing I'm trying to point you to the message of the hour which is pointing you to the Bible and that's a great power point it's it's wonderful to be that and you know to understand all right now look what the prophet had to say CU we've been over this quote many times but look what he says this is taken from uh Revelation 5 paragraph 79 and 80 and we find out then that this beginning of the chapter then we find that the the fifth chapter is just a tie block it it's a diamond hitch that ties the last part of the church age of the third chapter the fourth chapter tells what John was taken up into heaven and the fifth chapter is preparing for these where you went through the church ages now want you then John's lifted up in the fourth chapter and the fifth chapter he's just setting a scene for the opening of The Seven Seals just as he did in the first chapter of Revelations opening the way for the church seven Church ages the name he's going back to that to show you there he stands in the seven golden Candlestick and he look upon a jasper sard stone and he's preparing for the seven Church ages Le we prepared back there for the church ages in chapter 1 now we come into chapter 5 and he's preparing for what now he's preparing for the opening of those Seven Seals of redemption see that's what the fifth chapter is that's the reason I kind of read it and then take it from there and talk on it and give the other parts of the scripture is because it's it isn't verse by verse something that's happening it's preparing for something to happen and if you get to preparation then you've just you you're ready for it then That's the Way It Is by faith or anything else so what did he say up in the quote up above preparing for what this is the preparing for the opening of The Seven Seals now we say well you know the prophet it just it just that just seals open it was just that way and and we want to get to a point in a little bit I want to ask you you a question but go ahead with number two on the notes brother look what he says about this fifth chapter this is paragraph 290 of the breach preaches 63 through1 17 and now watch what he done that watch what taken place you talk about a jubilee now this is the fifth chapter all right now this is exactly the opening of them seals take place now if you look in your book on the the doing they change that from taking to take which is no difference in the word but they tried to revise a lot of things in the new edition of your computer right but now look he says that actually in chapter 5 is the breaking of those seals well we know that chapter 6 is when they start breaking you know the lamb breaks the seal Etc but now I've tried to get you to see what about it that you and I as the Bride of Jesus Christ there is no book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne until this end time bride completes that book that's right right it's going to be completed cuz that's what he said said once the book is completed then the lamb can take the book B all right see then we are the book right is any problem with that the Believers in the book is the book we said when I look at the book well there's a lot in the book that doesn't apply to you and I right we're going to get to that this morning in part to show but yet you and I are in the book not our names written there as Samuel Dale and and you know and Dick Addison or anything like that but it's like brother R said about brother brother um there at the brother Neville he said now it's his name being in the book said it's what's the hour that you're living is written in the book all right now I believe that you and I are living in the last days don't you I certainly hope so you know I'm already 72 but I'm not worried about it you know but I believe we're in the last days but you know what I believe when I come into the message and saw it the Prophet was beginning to say to I believe that was the end days didn't you I believe we're in the end time the end time is not just to say one day or whatever there's got to be a people make this word alive in this end time amen and that's what I've been driving at all the time because the reason I can say that is the fifth chapter shows us in heaven right all right so then that means somebody's going to be there right is that simple enough somebody's going going to be there in heaven one day to fulfill this chapter 5 all right and then doing that why can't we believe we're them right and if we are then we're the words that's in the book Paul said you're written officials known and read of all man brother R said if it was time to write it we no need of it he said because it would be over with but he said if it's time to write it then it' be another book of Acts written behind this church right well I don't see nothing well you know what you've been the same way right I've got takes in my uh truck and I got you know in the car and everything and a lot of times I just keep playing that same tape well you know I hear Brother random I've heard him probably 30 times lately talking about that he said you can go overseas and he said there'll be 30,000 hundreds of thousands come to me he said and come back here he said standing out in the hot sun and you know everything all day he said crowded around him at the airport that they had to take the militia to be able to get him in and out to just to get to hear about Jesus Christ he said in here you can take the finest buildings a great comfort of the pews and said it's hard to get people coming said if they do they kind of oh well that's pretty good you know it's kind of like brother Mo brother Tatum telling me about a woman preacher that was in this message that years ago and said they asked her you know kind of what she thought about brother R's Ministry that was good but said seem better than my own well you know something to that degree you know I don't believe it amen if I'd been there I wouldn't have believed it right I would have just said H they don't need me listening to you I say if you do bore me because it's not true see we believe the prophet spoke of an end time bride I believe God is revealing his word around the worlden and getting a bride ready against that day yeah but I w't see signs and wonders if you back there you'd want to see signs and wonders open your eyes God is doing things there's been enough healing right here Among Us in the past 3 months to be able to see that God still Is A Healer that's right that's right right amen you said well you know no we never will see the day like brother randam in the in the doings cuz that's over with that's right it's not made for the Gentiles the next Revival is to the Jews after we get out of here but that's no reason not to believe that we're in a Revival I'm in a Revival every day when I read God's word and I hear that that Prophet as he begins to expound upon these things and to see the word of God revealed that's my Revival I don't know what you're looking for amen I just know one thing for sure I'm going to make this statement quick if you can't see God now living and doing then you couldn't see him no worth El that's amen that's that's just the plainest can be the dead could be raised the sick could be healed and you'd never see it but if you're not ordained to see it you won't see it so then I'd say as far as I'm concerned that's what I don't understand about people people say I don't believe soone what you want to say as far as I'm concerned cuz you're trying to make it look like everybody you remember brother Bram got a letter saying we don't want you over here something like Africa thing right he checked in to come find out that we was one man well you know the the letter says we right well we're just sit down on our own s and do whatever but now listen see then in seeing what the prophet said see actually chapter 5 is you and I rejoicing in heaven amen now if you get in your seal book you'll find this quote brother ROM is referring to and I invite you to read the seals if you want to start on the first seal and and go through I wish you would though we pretty well we covered up into the breach and that way when I make a statement you I read that I read that see all right see then brother random in the breach would say this is the opening of the seals then you'll hear him over like in the first seal he'll say John was rejoicing you remember that you remember where there in chapter 5 where he says you know all in Heaven and Earth heard me saying heard I saying brother R said must have seen his name under there when one of the seals broke amen [Music] right he said one of the seals broke back there to who was it that Elijah that said you know am I left alone and the Lord opened one of the seals and showed him there 7,000 Believers but see we look at the seals is no it's got to be this it's got to be that it's got to be this it's got to be that and that's what we want to get to today I want to drive it down and then we'll move on and get over into the seals of what our understanding is but you say well how could the seals be opening in chapter 5 because you're there right I made that emphasis over and over two or three messages that the prophet said you are the book and when the book was sealed he said you're sealed with the book right right you see with the book he said when the book is revealed to Israel what are they going to see now come on what is Israel going to see well they'll see just put it down a nutshell what's Israel going to see they're going to see they crucified him right and they'll press in the hands which we know that's not physical so they're going to preach enough to them until they realize that they were the ones that crucified Christ right right that's right but when they go away and mourn for them mourning you know crying out weeping it's like a trying to emphasize a point they know then they missed the right of sunship that's why they're weeping and mourning sure brother killing of Jesus Christ but when they find out that they missed this thing because of the leaders of that day they missed the Messiah right and they're going to realize they missed the ride of sun and ship right God won't take them back as bride you can argue that point all you want to you ain't going to be in the Bible the prophet's message they become servants they'll always be servants 144,000 will be in the millennial right servants to the bride they'll never be nothing but servants why they rejected the ride of sunship Amen right all right now in doing that then they're going to see that you accepted sunship amen come on they're going to see that you the bride accepted the right of sunship and that you went through all of these things and now you come up into heaven in a Rapture go remember the prophet said what John going up to Revelations 4:1 is the top of the Rapture all right then if that be true then we're not there when the seals literally open to Israel you agree I certainly don't want to be there when the SI six seal takes place to you that's right so if you want to be here to 1 2 3 4 why don't you hang around for 5 six and seven see you want to divide that up and think well I got a quote here that brother R said the rde goes up four seal I agree with you that's 100% correct but you better believe that the four seal is armag get right are you going to be here at armag again come on he didn't just like this statement he makes here it needs Clarity it needs understanding right amen then in the fifth chapter of the Book of Revelations the seals actually broke why because the lamb took the book right he stands with it in chapter 61 and unfolds all right now so let's lay down some points and then I'll get to the question that hinges right there on that point go ahead with number three brother look what your Prophet has to say on Gabriel's instruction to Daniel 1961 7:30 morning service just getting what's underlined you read the rest of it I gave you the quote okay to where you can read it but look what's underlined the Seven Seals seven plagu seven wo seven trumpets has not one thing to do back up let's read that it has nothing to do with the church you know nothing to do with the Gentiles these seven Church Seven Seals seven plx seven wo seven trumpets as not one thing to do the Gentile church will be in glory at that time don't have nothing to do with us the Gentile Church it only deals with Israel Daniel thy people and Jerusalem now so we're going to go down through some quotes but to make a point see then from Revelations 4:1 to 19:21 has nothing to do with the bride of Jesus Christ automatically you run up with the question what about re you mean Revelation 10:7 Revelation 10:7 got to go to Israel right didn't brother Brown say I always thought I had would have something to do with the Jews receiving the gospel amen and you know he will that's right you know why cuz it'll be his message not him and certainly not like a man years ago that we were up there at Gainesville and he was teaching he said or told it that you don't believe that two prophets could be a gentile bride and a and a gentile prophet of course you know who he was talking about being the Gentile Prophet was him all right but see that's where people try to figure things out instead of leaving it alone that's right letting the Holy Spirit bring it to a place so the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 he said but what about Revelations 10 brother we see you're messing up on 101 anyway cuz brother R said 101 and this a direct quote he said 101 was the same as Revelation 1 13 now I didn't say that he did Revelation 13 is what one standing in the midst of seven golden can La un the son of a man G about the PS femish the bride you hear a lot about 107 but you don't hear 101 we just read 10:7 why did John after all the bringing what he's doing and all at once he said comes to the Thunders in verse four I mean verse six we run through there of the 10th chapter but then all at once he said but in the days of the seventh angel I don't put him over there that puts his message over there going to Israel but in the days of the seventh angel that's where he's at that's right he's the seventh angel to the seventh Church age right and see it be his message it'll go to Israel because it'll be his message that describes cuz he was the one that described that the Jews would be rejected that's where we got the understanding the Jews would reject the gospel or did reject it and won't be no nowh that they will actually return his sunship but they return his servants see his M why his message is the entire Bible right right come on that's the prophet's message we to take all the loose ends of the Bible that was left things that was not understood by man and reveal it unto you and I oh yeah Str ask the question now who broke the seals if you say brother brand broke the seals then you're deity that's right mhm sorry I'm blunt with you you be blunt with me oh yeah people say I don't agree with you well that's blunt ain't it well I just tell you where I stand and at least then you don't wonder what I'm talking about that's right you can see it right up front what I'm saying but you better believe one thing I'm saying what he said here let's come on let's see you say it that way and bring it some other way see but but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel see John comes writing he's writing he's writing he's writing and then he sees the the chapters the five and then six and seven 8 and nine and he wonders how in the world can I get this to the church cu come on was not John commanded in the first chapter to write these things down and bring it to the church he said how can I get it back there he said but in the days let me paraphrase it and change a wording and let you listen but in the days of the Prophet that will come in the seventh Church age to bring the word unto us the mysteries of God would be revealed M did I change to Revelations 10:7 no put it down in plain language of where we're at what we're doing yeah you said well what about 184 come out of her my people well how you come out of the denomination that's right right come on see what we're missing church is what I've tried to drive and I want to drive it home today cuz it keeps burying on me so maybe it's me that don't understand so you sit and listen while I preach to me okay see this message is the complete Plan of Redemption this message this Prophet brought us the complete Plan of Redemption there's no loins in it it's all perfect right even showing us the future home showing us all of the things down Through the Ages that we would not dare to touch while we were among the denominations and things but yet his message brought us the truth and we'll be judged by it too because we've heard it amen see then we want to try to take something like place it like I told you I got into a discussion with some ministers over this point and they were saying well the Book of Revelation is not in chronological order I challenge you on brother Brown's message but you go find that for me you find me where brother Brown said it's not in chronological IC order come on people don't like that cuz I'm sarcastic I know it if that means sarcastic to just try to tell somebody the truth and stand on it and say show me I thought brother R said he' be glad when somebody look him in the eye and say you're not saying what Paul said right well I think it's time to look people in the eye and say you're not saying what brother rold said that way with stand on the message mhm I've got to face God for what I preached to you that's right am but you got to face God for what he preached to you want you hear but you see we say it's not in chronological order brother said the D in the buts was in perfect place that's right right I want you to show me where brother around said the Book of Revelation is not in order do you don't have any quotes for it that's your supposed idea because you're trying to say this ought to be over here this ought to be over here and this ought to be over there don't you leave it alone why don't you believe what he said amen the seals is the entire Bible right right reveal what has was what is what shall be right the complete Plan of Redemption was brought through those seals then why can't we just sit down and say well wait a minute I don't understand it we're facing that about the Daniel 70 weeks brother Brown said Daniel 70 weeks was a parable that's what's going to be in the next ministry's meeting you know what a parable is you know that Jesus never spoke to mankind without a parable the Bible says right without a parable spake he not unto them that it might be fulfilled in Parables he spoke the things things right M you know what a parable is brother R said God done it this way to where he keep the church watching right come on keep the church waiting see if we have known it's going to be on a certain certain date I don't care what you think we'd become lazy shiftless bums because that's what happened right but that's what happened to the people of the message cuz it didn't happen 73 they went down it didn't happen in 77 they went lower didn't happen in 80 you know 6 and all like that they went lower didn't happen in the year 2000 boy they really slump down now you know they demoted because they I can't figure it out there's no way to figure it out right my brother ROM said it's written in Parables that you can't figure it out am and it would take a prophet to explain The Parables right right right mankind can't understand Jesus never spoke to them without a parable brother R's message is a parable same book Daniel 76 he said Jesus was crucified in ad30 two or three paragraphs later he said Jesus was crucified in ad33 you know that's exactly right well how could that be cuz one of them's 30 other's 33 according to our calendar that we started off with a one Jesus was crucified in 33 but according to where our calendar should have started Jesus was born in 4 BC that would make him being crucified in ad30 the brother R is exactly right simple techn simple terminology right if you understand but you see church that's what we need we need a revelation right but you know what I love about R random is what as he was and what he would bring you know he'd say now I don't believe that the bride's going through the tribulation I'm paraphrasing the quote but I find it for you he said I don't believe the bride is going to go through the tribulation but he said where she goes up before or after I just want to go up with her right amen now that's how wonderful a man could talk that could stand there with thus sayith the Lord right but yet he saying wherever it goes I want to go up with it there's what we need right that reminds me of what I've been doing I've been praying for a Revival I told you about it for 2 years now I've been praying for a Revival in this church we're not all over the world in this church and you know what a Revival is going to bring it's going to bring some people in but it's going to take out a lot of people that's right sure will the achens can't stay with a Revival see I realize that but i' I've got to preach it and believe it I'm praying for a Revival I'm praying for a house cleaning right you might order to look under your seat you might find a prayer CLW stuck under there you remember that that I put a PR cloth under a Brother's seat and about a month or so later he was gone from here you might order look under your seat you might find one of course the way you juggle around sometimes I have to put them if I did put them there I'd have to put them under every one of them cuz the way you juggle around you know and sit in different places you I'm making a joke on this truth I'm praying for house cleaning starting in the pull pit a Revival cuz that bride the brother R said it take those seven unknown Thunders to wake her up is that what he said so I believe we're in the end to don't you why can't I pray for a Revival I ain't praying for a worldwide sweeping Revival I'm praying for a Revival in this church everybody else got to pray for their own get back to the point get know I get to preach and I get off in the point okay so now let's just prove that from Revelations 4:1 to 19:21 that the bride is not seen on Earth is that what your Prophet to say she goes up in 41 and not seen to 1921 he call it 21 but you go over look at your scriptures about 14 15 where it's come back in the Millennium you know what do you believe that well brother D how do we get to se those oh praise God who broke the seals come on and when it it break come on according to my Bible and according to your Prophet the seals broke 2,000 years ago right yes sir that's right amen see that's where people can't follow brother Brown they think the seals broke that he broke the seals no he's not the lamb the lamb broke the seil right that's right you see then where we're putting it all right well let's get the point and drive this down and then we'll finish our thought look at the next one number four brother this is the paragraph 193 of the 70th week of Daniel now reading I'm to say this because sometimes you miss what said uh when they put the 2010 version up they called it the 70th week of Daniel for some reason I don't know why it is not that in your book it is called a 70 weeks of Daniel it's not called the 70th week of Daniel see they Chang those things I'm just telling you those things you go home and say well he he don't even know what he's talking about because my book says 70 weeks of Daniel well that's the new 2010 version they brought out okay so paragraph 133 says 193 excuse me says what now that we see now and all this now that we see will help us by his grace as we Endeavor to approach these last seven seals now this is over in the 70 weeks of Daniel right he's getting prepared remember that's a preparation see where we' have missed it from Revelation 6:1 to 1921 we would have missed it because see we we have been trying to apply it back there in this Gentile age where you see it's over in this age it's over to Israel see church I've tried to explain it to you for 40 years the actual seal itself breaks to Israel when we leave brother R asked in the question does second Thessalonians the man of sin sit in Temple Of God fulfill the first seal and he says yes that was on your questions and answers on the seals but you see we get all confused about what's this what's that just look at your Bible look at the Bible and read it read your prophet's message all right look what he goes on now bringing these day up up okay taking sides with Jesus number five which we realize in Revelation is just 1 2 three chapters to the church the church goes up in the fourth chapter it does not return anymore till the 19th Chapter that's after the tribulation period when God calls out the Jews okay keep on going number six the breach paragraph 23 now now we're going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not the Seven Seals it is the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals now there is also a sixth chapter and there was a fourth chapter rather Revelation and that it kind of reveals something that would take place after the church going up that the church goes up on the third chapter of Revelations what end of the verse right end of the chapter third chapter all right and does not return until the 19th Chapter of Revelation see therefore the church misses the tribulation now we're great to to want to quote and understand that we miss the tribulation but how do you know you're going to miss the tribulation because the church goes up right but we Glory we're not going through tribulation but we don't well I don't understand where we go up or what we do we just we just miss the tribulation well that's what your Prophet come to explain look at the next one paragraph 194 the four seal watch rides a pale horse as he appears on his ride this last ride he's on his last ride now that is not in our day that will be on down it's the still foretold because the church has done gone up when this happens paper is stuck together look at the next one fifth seal just going right on through the message paragraph 87 the fifth seal that's the reason that he reveals that as I understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being revealed and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right that they're away from the church age the church age absolutely the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up at the fourth chapter of Revelation and does not return again return until it comes back with with its king in the 19th Chapter but these seals are revealing what has been what is and what will be now that we what has to be for the church age was revealed by these seals right go on to the next paragraph 218 now these cannot be them Souls because the The Souls of of the righteous martyr and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride see now watch they are gone in the Rapture on the fourth chapter of Revelation they was taken up and who are these Souls then what is it that's the next thing who are they if they're not the early church it is Israel that to be saved as a nation so you it right on over look at the Sixth Seal paragraph 67 now we're living in a terrific time the that that that you see these things that we're in now and we're studying right now is after the church is done gone see these things are the tribulation period 6 SE paragraph 190 now God is not dealing with the church no more it's done been gone he's dealing with Israel see this is the other side talking about Israel and they're doing right Feast of the trumpets 1964 719 the morning service paragraph 36 and paragraph 37 the first three chapters of the Book of Revelation reveal all that happen happenings unto the church then from the third chapter into the 19th Chapter of Revelation there is no more scene of the church the church goes up at the 4th chapter of Revelation and returns back at the 19th Chapter of Revelation the bride and the groom together going to the coming to the Earth and then from the 19th Chapter to the conclusive of the 22nd chapter it's all on the Millennium and what be in the be will be in the years that is to follow it during the 4th to the 19th God is dealing with Israel right God is dealing with Israel during that time we're not there you said well what about it brother D what are you trying to show us the seals broke 2,000 years ago the Bible says that was in glory cuz that's where we're at the actual opening of the first seal is not the manifestation of the man of sin is not until we get out of here you agree with that that's right leave in church we're in the time of the opening of the seals to the bride are the revealing of the seals to the the making known of what those things are we'll start this afternoon Lord willing back pick up the Deeds Doctrine Etc and bring it out the down to the Antichrist cu the first seal is what the Antichrist that's right no the first seal is a revelation of Jesus Christ the Antichrist is what you see in in opposition you better read your seal book and then when you read that seal book listen to the things brother around said he said look at that fell look at that guy look at this person going the other way and you'll see that he's talking about the man of sin the Antichrist we're in the days when things are transpiring we are the bride of Christ we're not here in the tribulation yet we know what's going to happen in the tribulation we're not here at the battle of Armageddon and the physical point because we done go in the Rapture but my point is who opened the seal I thought the lamb opened the seal I didn't know it was brother Rand had open the seal he didn't open any seal he just spoke what God told him about it that's right he come back from Arizona the Lord had done spoke to him I D to go home right it'll be told to you about the seals he comes back to the and saids I don't know what that first seal is a brother Dale you don't understand he knew well he said didn't that's right and now where we're going to cross at is right here cuz he said on that first seal he said I have made a horrible mistake right if the Holy Spirit had not come in corrected he because I was going to preach what I previously preached you know what he previously preached that's why was right or was the Holy Ghost but you see he didn't understand until the Holy Spirit met him in the room he was fixing to come out and preach that wrong now that's his word I've had people say well you know about different things about the message and they say well that's just to deceive you what he said it like that well he done a good job matching up the Bible and bringing things out to really deceive a lot of people amen you know and who's going to be the one to figure out what's right and what's wrong well this is the way I believe it okay you're American citizen you got a right but being a Christian you don't have a right Christians don't have rights that's what me and my wife talking about yesterday I don't understand the people people of this message they can just make up anything in the world and people just run for it and flop after it any kind of a Doctrine any kind of an idea that's right and yet every one of them claims to have of the Holy Ghost right right you ever heard a preacher say he didn't have the Holy Ghost you ever talk to anybody about a doctrine that they tell you this one I believe I don't have the Holy Ghost no people don't talk like that do they see Church who broke those seals making it the way that the biggest portion of the people of the mess it but around broke but according to the Bible the lamb broke the seal right according to brother randam on the first seal he said the lamb and God and the Holy Ghost all is what he said the S same person well the lamb was the only one that could break the seal but now I will go on further to S you your same Prophet also said that Jesus Christ did reveal anything to you he said it takes a father to reveal Hallelujah it takes the Holy Ghost to reveal so even though the lamb took the cover off the book 2,000 years ago it couldn't be comprehended right right that's right so when the prophet came did the prophet break the seals or did the lamb break the seal it's like I told you I didn't finish that message y the the other week sister Gail said you spoke to her heart this morning to her head this afternoon it was all right I was simply making a point brother around said you can call him Jesus Jesus and be worshiping the devil you know that's a quote now is a denominational Doctrine right no well then if you believe a denominational Doctrine then you're worshiping Satan is that simple yes but brother Dale we I know it and God went to their ignorance true but then sent somebody along like me to be sturing and hateful enough to tell you or to ask you would your Revelation go to Israel and convert the Jews they certainly wouldn't listen the two souls and two Lords and all of those doctrines that's in the message Jesus wouldn't go out till the River Jordan you remember what that man said to the rabbi when brother around asked him about Jes he said he's that he said Isaiah he said that'll be the Messiah he said will the Messiah be God he said yes right and then we look up and try to divide him he said don't you talk to them about that he said because they'll show you right where that Doctrine came from that's right well why can't we show the people of the message right where their Doctrine came from Brother Brown said a trinity came out of the pits of hell now that's my word not my words that's your Prophet right and see if you believe it that's where you going but brother Dale only doctor there such wonderful brothers you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen right you got to baptism of the Holy Ghost he ain't going to let you be deceived you might get a little confused yeah you might have problems yes right but you won't be deceived people say well I know all along that doctor that man had would right and you sat there and listen to it I didn't make the statement you did so you condemned your own that's it you said I know all on that went right well why didn't you get up and leave amen well brother D can't do that we got to go church somewhere well get out and find one or start you one you can't find it start one preach the truth well you're just trying to build a church up now I'm trying to EMP it cuz we don't get we're not full today but when everybody's here we're full I'm trying to empty some seats but now you know better than that cuz you know the way I preach and what I mean I would to God we had to build 10 times this building right for people that want to hear the truth but I ain't got no time to argue and fuss with nobody about the little pity Patty quotes or thoughts that they got well I think this is it brother brother said that's what he done in the garden said she took her own ideas and said I think mhm back to what I said you say well I can't think if you're a Christian you can't anybody want to argue that quote if you're a Christian you can't have your own ideas now show me in the Bible I'm wrong is that a right statement if you got the Holy Ghost you can only be led by the Holy Ghost right true I thought we believe the Holy Ghost would lead us to the truth the church who broke the seals who opened that's what I asked the question who opened those seals the way most people think brother brandom did no they was open to John on patas mhm put in a church symbol why why was it put the church symbol your Prophet said it was to keep the church waiting had he wrote it down to Rapture is going to come in a certain certain dat come on you know yourself we just be relaxed and shess along well it don't matter that's next week I got a whole week to get ready for the Rapture yeah that's what we do M the first Seal white horse rider i r said John saw it in a symbol mhm but the seal was broke the lamb broke it but when it was sent down to man it was sent in a symol God knowing that in the end time there would come a prophet that would take them symbols and break them to the church now what if he did never preach 1 2 3 4 5 what if he' never preached those things and he walked out there and he said I want you all to know my Revelation this is the Antichrist you had no Foundation to base anything upon you would have been taken his word right but he preached all of those years getting us ready I'm talking about right now to get us ready to work and understand the symbol brother R said that was a white righteous Church a beautiful CH church that the Bible says John admired it that's what scripture say a beautiful Church system look at it today feeding the poor hospitals they got that's right I'm talking churches is doing all these things putting out the the tracks putting out going all over the world missionaries today not for just this message missionaries from Methodist Baptist and all that that's poverty stricken that have nothing to eat hardly themselves but out there on the feet trying their best get people to see God no wonder brother around called it a white church he said it was pure and clean but what about a pure and clean church when the head of it is the Antichrist what good does it do to be the white clean church if the Antichrist is head that's right right so that's the way we're going to go through the seals just take it just just you read the seals and let's go through it and just talk about the things I've done it in 79 and I'm interested in getting back into it again and not just try to deal with a seal or this that but to deal with what God reveals you ever notice in your s see go back and read it see if I'm right brother Ram spoke and he went stop the tape and wouldn't let it out he went home and preached what is called comments and would not release the original copy until what was it 65 after he died they released the original copy I've showed you that in the seal book right here in the church a lot of you look like you don't even know what I'm talking about but that's what he done go read your seal book it's right in the back of you tell you when did they tell you when it was released why because in his first part he called you what the see it was and the other it made it look like that he didn't know he was wondering because that was supposed to be done to keep you and I waiting and watching 40 something years that we've been watching and waiting not waiting on somebody to jump up and show how wrong brother random is like they're all doing now heard just recently but a man that say now that brother brandham had the old Catholic doctrine of believing that Jesus was crucified on Friday and raised on Sunday said he's really crucified on Wednesday that's what he said and you know what the person is so blind and I know I'm hard and hateful but so illiterate to truth until that was the Catholic Doctrine they said Jesus was crucified that's your Baptist and Methodist doctrine that Jesus was crucified on Wednesday Rose early Saturday or Saturday afternoon hung around all night Saturday night and waited till Sunday morning to appear to the disciples that's the Catholic Doctrine and a poor old human saying that that's brother R got a Catholic Doctrine mercy God come on the Bible said he was raised early the first day of the week your Prophet said he cut the LA in the do over 72 hours he would have rotten that's right amen oh but you see that's how wonderful we think we know yes but brother it's got to be 3 days and Jonah was in the belly of the well 3 days and three night Jonah was a resurrection son do matter how long he was there he was a resurrection ction sign he went down he come up that's Resurrection sign the Lord Jesus was crucified on Friday afternoon and Rose early the first day of the week which is on Sunday there Sal this Saturday right but you see that's what we think we know what do we know well brother R broke the seals now where'd you get that at the seals was revealed to brother BR the lamb broke the seal right okay let's read one to make sure okay go here with number go ahead let's just get number 13 out of the way where we got it to breach paragraph 142 and revealed as the seal break and are revealed to us then we can see what this great Plan of Redemption is and when and how it's going to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery here it's sealed with Seven Seals so the lamb is the only one who can break them that simple enough look at the next one this is the seventh seal paragraph 43 our heavenly father here comes that great night a great night that when a great thing Hasen happened it's been all around the people and father I pray that tonight that you'll that it'll be made known beond the shadow of it out to the people's heart and mind that they know that God is still on the throne see everybody said Redemption was over 63 listen to it he still loves his people and the the hour that the world has longed to see is now approaching where it cries out for Redemption when we see the elements ready to bring it back back we see the elements ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ we see the bride taking on the form putting the wedding garment on him making ready we can see the lights are flickering we know that we're at the end now heavenly father as this goes forward now to preach or to teach on this Great Mighty event that taken place in glory some 2,000 years ago so when was the s SE broke in glory 2,000 years ago there was no symbol so John Couldn't Write it he just said silence in heaven for the space of half an hour right that's not a symbol that was just a statement L said that seven seal is not even symbol he said it's your silence in heaven but when did the s still break 2,000 years ago and was given to the great beloved Apostle John and denight we're to speak on it let the Holy Spirit Come forward now his mighty power of Revelation that he might reveal to us that thing which he wants us to know as he has in the last few nights we commit ourselves to you with the word in Jesus's name amen the wind the seal bre 2,000 years ago the the lamb broke the seal left it in a symol and then the prophet was to come and he was the one to know how those symbols were and what they meant he said what about you people you doctors said explain to me why you got that sign out in the front of your office looks like a cross or a spear or something and a snake all the way around it said explain why it's there they said we don't know right ask you Doctor why is that emblem out there well it's not a healing well but how come that serpent on the pole how is a serpent on a pole a sign of healing come woman you got to go to your Prophet then right he said that said sin was judged it's why it's a snake on the pole sin was judged Ed and paid the price now what if he hadn't broke that symbol You' had a snake representing Divine Healing now how can a snake represent Divine Healing when he's the author of The Sickness you see why we had to have a prophet we had to have a prophet to break the symbols 30 something years he preached symbols Parables go look up the word Parable but let me give you a definition it's a long complicated story with times an underlying meaning that seems to be different from the surface meaning Jesus began to talk to them Pharisees and you know while they C on and they said we know he's talking about us he never went over you you do he just give a parable just make a parable out of it brother random preached in Parables that's why it's hard to understand it going to take the same holy spirit that he had to reveal it to you that's right right like I said how can that doctor say that snake is a sign of Divine Healing why did God tell a man just take a snake and put it up on a pole the thing that was killing them brother around said that was a sign that sin was judged so when they looked at it they wern't looking to the snake to heal them they were looking at the god that told him to put it there amen it healed the people yes when we get to playing around in this message whether it was brother random it broke the seals or or whether it was this one or the lamb or who is brother randam is he this that or the other and we get down to seeing the Lamb is almighty God Revelations chap 5 you remember we preached on that quite a while got an odd looking lamb that lamb in CH 5's got seven horns and seven eyes run around and said it come from the church ages I didn't say that I didn't have enough sense to you didn't me he said that lamb come from the church agent why because there 7even horn 7 eyes represents the church head go back and read chapter one if you don't believe it just want to ask you a simple question in the day did God take your Revelation and go to Israel and we know Israel is going to be converted by the two witness I mean that's going to come under the two witness we know that we're not talking about we're just talking about plain language what kind of Revelation do you and I have said Israel had one God he said we got one God but what people don't read is what I reading there we have to pull it back on the screen I think you ought to remember it the world and aim the time is to un they'll know that God is still on the throne and he loves people that the hour hour that the world has longed to see is now approaching it cries out for Redemption look at the natural world out there what's taking place look what he says though tonight we speak upon it let the Holy Spirit Come forward now in his mighty power of Revelation that he might reveal to us these things which he wants us to know that he has in the last few nights people the people's heart and mind that they know God is still on the throne and he still loves his people brother rown said look at it said the church is back exactly like it was at Pentecost well I don't see it are you going to tell him it ain't right come on got to see it are you going to be bold enough to tell the prophet oh baby you got to see it I thought he had a vision a dream or a vision and in that dream or Vision that he saw a bride sure they got out of step right but he saw her lining up cuz he was holling at her right whether you believe it or whether you like it or whatever it is anybody out there or whatever you think about God is still God he didn't die when brother around dead he's still God you say well is he on the throne well he must be because if he ain't on the throne Redemption is over that's right I sure had to think that I was a parent that had children that was not saved and to think that I would be the one that decided they wouldn't be saved but fact of me saying Redemption was over cuz that's the first thing hit us in ' 63 I mean' 67 when left P not from the church I was in but from the people of the message that day was saying that Redemption was over in 63 and we've been 40 something years with Redemption being over so ain't nobody been saved since 6 three where would you and I be that's right amen but you see we you take the ideas and the thoughts but who broke who opened those seals that's a simple point the way most people preach but R did but remember the seal was sealed up but R say on that breach and things through there I don't know what that first seal is when he gets on the first seal he said I don't know what the second seal is what he said or any of the other what he said you know what you say he did then you make him a liar your problem not me he didn't know that's right until the lamb broke the seal that's right to him but did he break the seal to him like breaking it and letting no he didn't break there is already broke that's what I'm trying to get you to see the seal was already broke it was broke 2,000 years ago handed down to a prophet in the last days to speak on it to you and I and tell us what those symbols were he said well then brother brother D you run out on Li because run around said there's no symbol on the seventh seal you're right I agree with you that's why if you read the seventh seal book and read it real careful you'll find brother brandham talking about his own life and what God was doing in him that's right Jesus preed six seals never preached the seventh that's Matthew 24 read it why cuz he was the seventh that's right amen I BL around wouldn't the seal but he knew what that seal was oh brother ROM page 45 I believe I'm right now if don't I'll get it for 45 it's rising the Sun what is those seals he said it's it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right there you see it was a revelation of Jesus Christ that's the revelation of the Antichrist that's what everybody's always made you say well most people you say to them what is the first seal Antichrist that's not to see seal the Holy Spirit right Antichrist is in opposition what is that six seal brother Rand tribulation period That's Not Jesus Christ come on who broke your seal who do you find I believe they were broke 2,000 years ago in glory because the Bible said your Prophet said that happen and then he come to a time that God told him what that symbol was under that seal and when he did he preached it there was what was to come to you and I that would open up the entire Bible you had never heard the one come on you you never heard the one where brother R was talking about let's see if I can paraphrase that we forget it let it go it won see the whole book is a revelation that Jesus Christ that's right that's why they couldn't understand it why we kept on reading Peter those people knew come on your Bible says they knew that it was not unto them that God done these things but it was toer us in the end time the whole Bible pointing to you and I like I was trying to say last night the Bible says that God spoke to Abraham told him to get up and go and a man that was totally from heathenism that's your prophet's words don't mind that he said Abraham was a heathen making Idols for his dad-in-law and he gets up and goes can't you see the day that God stopped you and told you to turn around and to repent of your sins you remember that I said their lives not rejoice here in the people tell of their experience of Jesus Christ in their life and when God first contacted them can you remember might have been in that little child stage might have been a little teenager might have been whatever but you remember that something began to talk to you right but yet we say if I had just been back there like Abraham and heard God who do you think's talking to you right you what I'm not Abraham brother around and said every son of Abraham was to take the same Journey that Abraham took look at Abraham he met God I mean God spoke to him they got his justification he begins to leave and follow that God and God begins to contact him after a while he literally comes right into his presence and he feeds him a c almighty God you say was that ever happened to me was you Justified have you been Sanctified have you been filled with the spirit of almighty God then God contacted you right amen when are we going to get to the place to take the scriptures where it when it talks of Jesus said I'm pleased to dwell in him why can't we believe that he's pleased to dwell in US amen amen right if he's not then we don't have the new birth that's simple enough there's a lot of difference in if you get Nam say the seal was broke 2,000 years ago put in a symbol to keep the church waiting and the end time a prophet was to come that that symbol could be broke not the seal the seal was done broke we it has happen on the earth let's Stand Together 364 inp 364 inpire B anybody have a need in like this you need a saor in time like this you be very sure anybody have a need I believe that same God still Le you still this rock is Jesus yes he brother said how many gods did Israel have one have many gods in the right house one your maker and you have a need just come let's believe you what I said that the other day brother said all you got to do to be in idolatry is let God be Idol in your life I same word well I don't care you probably said it if you want to be an idolatry just let God be Idol in your life cuz you know what idol mean I have a are you I never been a time that we need Jesus is right now more than ever ever before in our lives that's right that's true there look at the world falling apart look at all the things look at all of the doctrines and the things among the people of the message leading people forth taking them off the word we need God more than anything that's right amen yes sir like I said one ago let me be able to quote that brother RS would say if the bride goes up before the tribulation or after the tribulation and I just want to make sure I go up with it you know he sincere but you know we ought to be that way let's be sincere in our hearts and say Yes amen God is real we love him we thank him right whatever comes or goes we still go right on down the road and thank you Lord because we believe father we thank you for the service today and we pray that what we said
