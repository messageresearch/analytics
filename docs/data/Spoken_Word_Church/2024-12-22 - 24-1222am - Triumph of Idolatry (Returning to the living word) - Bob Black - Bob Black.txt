destructions amen God bless you you may be seated amen okay so I think uh they're all ready to uh come up here for the skit so uh we're going to sing just a little chorus here go till it on the mountain and you know we uh we know during this time that Jesus wasn't born during this time but I'll tell you there's such a personal parallel to the birth of the word in your life do you remember when God moved in your life you wanted to go tell somebody before you didn't you shot away from it but then when it became a reality you wanted to tell somebody that's the true Christmas is God in you and your heart that he can go witness to somebody else about what brother Ram said tell somebody about how you got your candle lit be a light Go Tell It on the Mountain amen uh so they can prepare to go ahead and come in oh yes Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hills and everywhere Go Tell It on the Mountain that Jesus Christ is born oh Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hills and and everywhere Go Tell It on the Mountain that Jesus Christ is born [Music] you [Music] night holy night all is [Music] Cal is bright round young virgin mother and child holy inant so tender and M sleep in Heavenly [Music] peace and sleep de in Heavenly [Music] peace silent night holy night sheer Quake I the side go glorious dreamss from Heaven of far and Heavenly Hing hallelu Christ the savior is born [Music] Christ the savior is born Silent Night oh night Son of God L pure light and beams of thy holy face with the dawn of Redeeming Grace Jesus Lord at thy birth Jes Jesus Lord at thy birth silent night holy night wonderous star let thy light with the Angels let us sing [Music] Hallelujah to our King Christ the savior is born Christ the our savior is [Music] born a little town of Bethlehem looks like another silent night above your deep and dreamless sleep a giant star lights up the sky and while you're lying in the dark there shines an everlasting light [Music] and for the King has left his throne and is sleeping in a Manger tonight [Music] now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privy but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus and he shall deliver his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emanuel which being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bided him and took unto him his wife and he knew her not until she brought forth with her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus Oh Bethlehem would you have missed While You Were Sleeping for God became a man and stepped into your world today oh Bethlehem you will go down in hisory as a city with no room for it King while you were [Music] sleeping while you were sleeping and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth Mary Shivers in the cold trying to keep the savior born born among the animals wrapped in dirty rags but there was no room for him and the world he came to save oh Bethlehem what you have missed While You Were Sleeping for God became a man and stepped into your world today oh Bethlehem you will go down in history as a city with no room for its king while you were sleeping while you were sleeping now when Jesus was born in Judea of in in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him oh little town of [Music] Jerusalem like another silent night the father gave his only son the the truth the life had come but there was no room for him in the world he came to [Music] save for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life he can make the blind man see he can make the lame walk I don't know about y'all but I never seen a man who can do that you need to repent and be baptized and you will receive the gift of the Holy [Music] Spirit come and see Jerusalem would you have Miss While You Were Sleeping the savior of the world is dying on your cross today Jerusalem you will go down in history as a city with no room for its king while you were sleeping while you were [Music] sleeping and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when serenius was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea under the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the end and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us go even unto Beth lehem and see these things which are come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all that heard it wondered at those things which were told by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them United States of Amer looks like another silent night as we're Su to sleep by philosophies that save the trees and kill the children [Music] and while you're lying in the dark there's a shout across the Eastern sky and for the bridegroom has returned and is carried his bride away in the night [Applause] [Music] let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his his wife ha made her herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints America what you will miss while you are sleeping oh Jesus come again and sleeping slumbering while you lay America you will go down in his as a nation with no room for its king will you be sleeping will you be [Applause] [Music] sleeping United States of America looks like another silent night and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins [Applause] while they get prepared got M while they get prepared for this that was such a wonderful play did you see the message in that yes are you sleeping or are you following the star are you letting the son of man Ministry dress you in the word uh for many years um this part of the uh program what they do is uh they have bells and each Bell is tuned to a certain key and for the visitors and the ones that are not uh used to seeing this they're going to play a couple of songs and everyone has their part to play just like the bride of Christ everyone has a part to play and uh such a beautiful Unity when they put it all together amen amen for for [Music] [Music] [Music] Beau [Music] [Music] call for [Music] for [Music] [Music] beautiful [Music] beautiful for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] beautiful [Applause] amen let's give the Lord another [Applause] hand [Applause] beautiful amen amen hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah reminds me of a uh [Applause] you there's a scripture that says whatever you do do it unto the Lord amen no matter what big what small whatever you do do it unto him and uh he's the one that receives all the honor the glory but we're thankful for those who have given their time and effort uh to put a story like this together and you kind of see the the spiritual meaning the natural meaning it reflects all of us and something we can relate to let's just give uh them another hand clap thank you for I tell you um I'm sure brother Dale would have loved that you know he he always liked the plays and um he always was supportive of them because they they relate into each of us and what God's doing uh through our lives and the bride and following uh the lot his star and uh we just thank the Lord for that you know earlier when we were singing that of course be it unto me um I just felt God told me to sing this as brother Bob comes out because you know that's where it started with Mary she opened her heart and said be it unto me according to Thy word amen it was a seed it was something that come alive in her heart that God was doing and it went on to the word made flesh and then that word came back into her heart by the spirit and such a a beautiful picture of redemption because ultimately like I was telling the kids yesterday Christmas isn't about just a day of gifts and things and we know that but brother R said it's a day of worship and that worship doesn't happen one day that spirit and Truth worship happens every day of of Our Lives it's a relationship that's what Christmas is all about every day can be Christmas for you it's a relationship you have with the word the spirit and life there such a lovely lovely such a lovely story of love it's such a love story amen howd you like them um putting the scriptures on the Garment there and the in the bride dressed in the word I tell you I really love that that was just like the toping on the cake that's that's that's the Fulfillment that's the reason he sent us a messenger that's the reason he sent us a message for us to become that let's all stand as we uh sing this chorus as our brother Bob comes out for the preaching of the word oh be it unto me oh let it be your prayer Accord to your [Music] word according to your promises I can stand secure and carve upon my heart the truth that sets me free bless you brother your word dear Lord be it unto oh sing it to him once more oh be it unto me according to your word Accord to your promises I stand secure and carve upon my my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word dear Lord be it unto me [Music] amen so grateful Lord this morning for for men and women and young people and old that have have caught the vision enough to put on a play like that and inspired to present things in that way Lord Jesus I thank you Lord Jesus that we come together today not not to celebrate some kind of a man-made thing Lord but to celebrate what you've given un us Lord Jesus the gift and what it really means to us and I pray God today Lord that you'll make today something special for us Lord you'll speak something to your people to help them Lord Lord I pray God that you'll help our hearts to be like that manger where you come ready to receive you ready to receive your word ready to die out to our to ourselves Lord Jesus and just open our hearts to receive your word that you can come and live in us and change us that's what this time and this season is really about I pray God that you'll bless this service today we ask in your name and the word as we read it amen I want to read um from Jeremiah chapter 7 this morning and Acts chapter 7 and I sure I sure enjoyed that thank you and take a little title uh it's kind of a long title triumph over idolity return to the Living Word now first we'll read from Jeremiah chapter 7 verses 10-1 17 and uh kind of a long reading this morning U but we'll read from there and then we'll go to Acts chapter 7 so jeriah chapter 7 and maybe just to to think about what Jeremiah he's he's he's rebuking the people who have uh well well in the verse in verse 10 here he says and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these Abominations so right away you can see he's rebuking Israel for you know they they come to to the Tabernacle of the Lord they'll come to the house and and and they think well we we're delivered of uh you know that we're standing in the house of God and we're delivered but yet see Jeremiah he's scolding them because they're actually looking at the wrong thing despite the fact that they're in the house of God and they're they're you know worshiping and things but he he said is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes and this is a scripture that Jesus quoted when he went into the temple and and platted the ropes and begin to uh because he saw that they had made made the house of God something that it shouldn't be and he said behold even I have seen it sayith the Lord but go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh where I set my name at the first Shiloh is where they when they when they come out of Egypt into the prom into the promised land through the through the Wilderness into the promised land they came to Shiloh and they put the T they started worshiping in Shiloh but after a while they got away from God and God allowed the Philistines to come in and just destroy direct the place so he's saying come now come you now into my place which was in Shiloh where I set my name at the first and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My People Israel and now because you have done all these works sayith the Lord and I spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and I called you but ye answer not therefore will I do under this house which is called by my name wherein you trust and under the place which I gave to you and to your fathers as I have done to Shiloh and I will cast you out of my sight as I have cast out all your brethren even the whole sea seed of Ephraim therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for I will not hear thee see us thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the children the people the people of Israel they were worshiping in the Tabernacle he said they they're Gathering wood the fathers Kindle Fire the women need their dough to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger now now you know what brother random is getting at when he's preaching this and that what Jeremiah is is he's trying to to expose how sometimes you can you can go to church and you can be doing things or you know like look at the today the the way the society is today going going to church and doing going through the motions and everything but actually looking at the wrong thing this is a strange Christmas message maybe hang on in Acts chapter 7 if we'll go over there in Acts chap 7 verse 44 uh uh this this is actually uh Steven he's defending himself because they're accusing him of blasphemy they're saying that when they that the the Jews of that day began to accuse Stephen of of um of of speaking against the Tabernacle and so Stevens begins to tell them you know you're looking at that Tabernacle at that place where you worship when actually God is now he's actually dwelling in in people so you're looking at a building for your identification you're looking at something something other and so he's said our fathers had the Tabernacle of w witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God dve out before the face of our fathers unto the days of of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelt not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you be build me sayith the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now this was this was taken from a Christmas message that brother brandham preached uh back in I think it was 1961 Christianity versus idolatry uh comparing Christian and idolatry and and and you know really Christmas Christmas is a is a strange time that it's like every every time people wrestle with with Christmas because it's got all you know you gather around with your family and you know we're about to be grandparents and we we we sure are ready to give some gifts and have have a good old time with our with with our first grandbaby and and as many as to come and and so boy as far as that goes I really enjoy I really enjoy Christmas you know we talk about having a a little a little train go around and and and and all the the little presents and things and don't you just love when you give a gift to somebody whether it's a birthday present or an anniversary present or just something you got for your wife or your husband uh and and maybe uh even at Christmas and and you see them open up that gift and they they you know it makes them happy and you know but on the other side of the coin though is that all these elements of Christmas are actually rooted in Pagan mythology and things and they've got all these things that you know Santa Claus Santa Claus is is is a lie now so you know you go back and really when brother randam would preach these things he say he say we're concerned about the children on Christmas he said I thought I had a Christmas message for the church but I had such a feeling for them little now look how he's framing Christmas he's he want he loves little kids you know you you want little kids are going to go to school and everybody else is getting a present and and and uh you know talking about things and then they're wondering why they don't get a present you know if you're looking at if you're framing up the the holiday like that so he's thinking about the kids he said I must say if I'd be here then the little fellas would probably many of them far away would miss their Christmas and things so it would be kind of hard on those little fellas and he said we people now now so he's he he wants to do for the little children now aren't you glad that we've got we've got the the the message framed up like that so with balance so that we're not too much on this this side too much on that side but we can look you know get around with your family at Christmas time and drink some hot chocolate with some a little peppermint stick in it but and and you can you don't have to worship Santa Claus or or have all that Santa Claus nonsense that lie but you can still get around with your family next to the crackling fire and think about what God has done for you and what Christmas is really about is it's not it's not uh the pagan holiday all the the the the the the time of the sun god of December 25th and all that stuff but it's really you know our Focus the meaning of it is that it's all about Jesus Christ now now that's that's why you know we we we don't teach our children that when you come to church we're preaching the truth it's all about the truth the Bible says that we've got to Worship in spirit and truth so that's why we don't tell our children lies about Santa Claus CU you imagine I I went to school with so many people growing up and you know they they come home and their parents would play this prank on them where they they actually get up on the roof with a clippity clop noises and they I heard it I heard the reindeer and and and do all these elaborate things and then and then later on you'd want you know all the other other kids there ain't no Santa Claus and and then they become a laughing stop and then then as time goes on that it it it come time for them to realize that it all was a lie and then now they got to wrestle with well why did my mama and daddy make me look like a fool why did my mama and daddy and then see you got that dilemma you got that thing you got to overcome now now they're going to tell you about Jesus Christ and now you got that big old Blocker in your head now well well if if you lied to me about this then what about that now now that's not just a lesson for Santa Claus though that's a lesson for everything see we'll put that over in a little special box and we then we'll we like well I can feel about this over here and I and FIB about that but you know God wants Christians to be to be truthful in every aspect of Our Lives he don't want a husband to hide stuff from his wife from looking on her his phone or hide that secret bank account or hide this or that but you be truthful be truthful at everything that you do cuz you know Christians Christians don't tell lies and Lyon let me just drop this over here Lyon stems from from and leads to broken relationships and mistrust and further sin and that's why Proverbs 12 says the Lord detests lying lips but he Delights in people who are trustworthy so you know you start talking about lying if you were to go to get in a Bible study you you get into all that territory of moral dilemas and things is it would it be all right to tell a little phib if you're if you're like Rahab on the roof and she's lying and she's told the well told the people looking for the spies well I don't know where they are and all those kind of things but but this but the the the sense of the thing the ESS the the the really the bottom line is is God is a god of Truth and if you're going to deal with one another in relationships and deal with one another in things always seek to tell the truth tell the truth no matter what because God is a god of Truth Now now see because Santa Claus Santa Claus Is A Lie brother Brown would say you can give gifts sing songs Fellowship around the real meaning without involving Santa Claus the meaning is we were given the greatest gift the meaning of Christmas is we were given the greatest gift that could ever be given and Christmas has lost its meaning what's the meaning Christmas is no more a worship we we went up to uh like brother William was preaching on a few weeks ago we went up to Dela and they got their big Christmas thing going on and and everybody's out there drinking and and doing you know doing the worldly things and it's like you you you all the commercial ISM and everything and it seems like just the world has just forgotten about what the real meaning is they're hustling and bustling trying to find gifts and things at this time of year trying to get gifts trying to get that poker game trying to get that uh that whiskey that they're going to give for a gift all those things but they they've lost the real meaning of what Christmas is and to them it's just become a big celebration drinking gambling carousing just pegging to the Limit but now on the other side the little children just don't understand that he said they see little fellas on Christmas night getting Christmas presents and things like that they don't understand it they're too little and we've got to remember them that they have things in common we got to bring oursel down to remember them them little fellas oh if we could if we could humble oursel down to remember that they're little they're just little kids and they don't know little kids he said you have to let them have something but always be sure of this tell them there is no such a thing as Santa Claus cuz one of these days they'll walk up and say what about Jesus then see so tell them the truth amen be honest with everybody and Christmas itself Christmas itself is a myth it it's nothing real about Christmas Christmas wasn't even mentioned in the Bible they never worshiped the birthday of Christ it wasn't no such a thing that's a Roman Catholic dogma and not a Christian teaching no scripture for it nowhere in the Bible and for the first UND years after the Bible nothing of it it's just a myth Santa Claus commercial everything the whole thing is wound up into a big conglomeration now that's why that's why Christmas this time has become such a confusion because on the one side it's just a me everything about it is fake everything everything the whole history of Christmas is not tied to Christianity at all but on the other side remember the little children remember them and and treat them right and and think about how they're going to react you know that what they they want a little something and and so forth and so on and that's why brother Brandon when he's preaching this sermon he said maybe I better he said don't even just don't even send the tape out because it's going to confuse everybody he said maybe I better censor this whole thing just not send it out May because it's pretty rude these tapes are not for sale they can be passed around through the church or so forth because it'll cause confusion as sure as the world ceas to just hold it till we get it fixed different see there's a truth there's a truth to Christ's birth but a whole lot of elements of Christmas are a blend of paganism and mythology and idolatry idolatry that attracts from True Christian faith idolatry idolatry is when you start elevating something above the word of God and you start looking at that instead of what the real meaning Isen you take this Santa Claus figure that that uh that you know the story of the St Nick where they he gave the eggs to the to the girls that didn't have a DIY and and and that blossomed on down through time into the story of of of a man that lives at the North Pole and he's got a little a little a little pole with a peppermint stripe around it and all these all these thing reindeer that come on top of your house and people will tell that to their children for truth and and and the same thing on the flip side what we're really getting to is that that things that are not true are preached to people and and they look at that and and expect to get something from God when it it's the same thing idolatry being lifted up above the word of God and they look to that instead of the word of God expecting to get something Christmas ain't about Santa Claus or money or stuff but it's about Jesus Christ what does December 25th got to do with Jesus's birthday what does Santa Claus got to do with Christianity and the North Pole and Rain deer and all giving all them things if Christmas Christmas has just become a brother like brother R said drinking gambling carousing just Pagan Pagan to the Limit I hope I hope y'all like that kind of preaching this morning that's a little bit different maybe for a Christmas message but again it goes back to truth we want we want the truth I want to know about things and you know you can have you look at this thing and and and and and while we've got the little train going around the tree and and all those things we can look at it with true understanding that we ain't we ain't worshiping Santa Claus and we ain't telling our kids about Santa Claus and we're not buying all these all these fake gift it's not just about commercialism where we're sit around with our family expecting to get a gift how many gifts am I going to get you know we we joke about how when we were kids we would sit around looking over at that Christmas tree and we would think oh Lord please don't let the Rapture come before I get my and now and and and now as we get older have we grown out of that are we still expecting to get all this all this pile of loot at Christmas or is it really is our heart really turn back to what it really is about about Jesus Christ and because now really any devotion any devotion or worship or priority that's placed above God is idolatry anything that you put above God is idolatry and brother Brandon would say there's a little wrote about idolatry there's not many books to explain idolatry what is idolatry and yet the world's full of it see when we think about idolatry we think of something over there over in India over there back in the historical days where they would have an idol but to think now that idolatry can actually be right here where where you've you've forgotten so much about God until you you've actually replaced god with with scrolling on your phone all day or or or or or or or just tapping into movies and things where instead of letting the word of God change your thinking you're letting the movies change your thinking to where the movies today have changed Society thinking until they're they actually don't know whether they're a boy or a girl or whether they're this or that and it's actually changed their thinking cuz they tapped into that instead of the word of God and they elevated that up to where it's it's it's a it's an idolatry what's what's the definition of idolatry he said some some worship movie stars for Idols some worship money for idols and some worship television stars as Idols but all that you put before God is an idol let it be whatever it be I think about when Moses when Moses went up into the mountain to bring down what the essentially the Seven Seals the The Ten Commandments back down to the children of Israel but it took too long and they got to wait and where's Moses at and instead of waiting for the word of God to come down then they Aaron and everybody got busy collecting all the gold and they made a golden idol how how how do they know to make it to look like a calf that's a good question to think about why do they make it look like a cat why do they fashion it that way but they instead instead of waiting for the word of God they elevated their own ideas and their own thoughts about what God would really be and they begin to worship that Idol that they created and any Act of idolatry brings the individual into spiritual alignment with forces opposed to God now now you think but you think about that that idolatry sitting there and watching your TV watching your love shows your romance movies it actually will begin to change your mind it change you because it begins to align you with something that different from what the word of God says and you start thinking well they're doing it on that TV show so it must be all right for me and my family and you you same thing with comic books you and anything you know you you start aligning yourself with that thing that anime that that so many people get caught up with when you start watching those people doing uh little girls having girlfriends and all that stuff and all that anime nonsense and you start aligning yourself with with that message and it begins to have an effect on your life so anything that replaces or detracts from our devotion to God can become an idol and open the door up to demonic influence now to think though that brother Brandon would say that idolatry is the same today as it has always been and studying idolatry mythology Greek mythology and Roman mythology it brings me back to see whether if idolatry remains as it was at the beginning today in travel seeing idolatry and then seeing the way it began I see that it hasn't chain now that's something to think about now now now we we're not just sitting around with a stick you know next to a fire and and and and and you know conking one another over the head and worshiping idols and but but but actually idolatry is so sneaky that it can sneak in right there in modern society and and what a Christmas message what a Christmas message to where the world I I I I was watching on uh you know you see those ads they'll pop up about what what local area churches are doing and things and I saw one where they they had somebody come down from the ceiling dressed in a looked like lights all over this woman's dress and they had a bunch of screens up behind her and all these this huge Coliseum looking place and and they they they they believe that they're sitting there getting something from God when the word of God is not being preached and they come out there dress like a bunch of pagans bobbed hair and and and dressed like the world and and and there with their coffee and all those kind of things coming to church just for coffee and not for the word of God but all those thing and and it becomes idolatry they're there for a Christmas show but a Christmas show has replaced the word of God it's repl and you know brother Brown want to go back and he began to talk about the Indian firew Walkers firew walkers in India and Farmers confessing sins to priest and Greek and Roman Idol worshippers and how they they really were sincere in what they were trying to do in the same way that many today are sincere about what they're trying to do they sit sincerely in churches all around the world and they're sincerely believing that they're coming to worship a God but they don't know the god of the Bible because they come and they've elevated man's ideas and man's thoughts above the word of God just in the same way that those Greek and Roman Idol worshippers they believed in some mythical god like Jupiter and Apollo they believed in prostrating themselves before those idols and offering candles and food and having communion with the idols and that communion actually turned down through time and where in the Roman Catholic church today they take that that round wafer that that was taken from the son God worship and and and Idol speaking back to worshippers and the Pueblo Indians in the US and all of them were were real real sincere worshippers not Hypocrites they are sincere people brother R will say just as sincere as you and I and sometimes more than we are here in America they are not Hypocrites they truly believe that and practice it with all that's in them many times they stick their tongue out and have a lance with a fork on it go through their tongue or if they if they told a lie they'll sew their mouth shut to to kind of as as Penance for saying something wrong they're very sincere but it ain't your sincerity that matters all your sincerity doesn't mean it God has only promised one way you think about down through time how many how sincere Cain was and how sincere uh Esau was come come very sincerely but without a real revelation of God God rejected Cain because he didn't have the spiritual Revelation but he come with a sincerity of heart I I many of us have seen those videos over there in the Philippines where they sincerely worship and they they they nail themselves to a cross sincerely worshiping but but what are they worshiping they're sincere about it and many today across the land sit in churches and they're very sincere about it that's why idolatry is a strange thing down Through the Ages we've had it ever since the beginning of time the order of this idol worship is the man sets up the idol he fixes the idol then he goes in and he prepares himself for this great worship now he believes that this Idol is made in the image of some God that he never has has never seen he's without a form so he believes he's in the image of this Idol that he makes to this God now don't let that leave you the image is in the image of the mythical god that he believes that he is in other words they're they're projecting the characteristics Authority and worship onto that image it's their what they believe what they believe they will get something from it's from their imagination or from their myths rather than the true God and then he goes and he before this Idol and he prostrates himself and he believes that the god that's an unseen person comes down into this Idol and he believes that he talks to God through this Idol that God brings himself into this Idol and answers him back he believes that God is actually speaking to him he believes that he's worshiping he believes something really true is happening oh you think today all across the land people are sitting in churches everywhere and listening to to false Theology and Creeds they're listening to like like so Simon the Sorcerer there in Acts and they believe that they're getting something but it's it's something fake in other words the god actually hypnotizes himself from his Supernatural standing into this Idol and speaks back to the worshipper through this Idol and the worshipper in some kind of a built up emotional sense believes that the idol speaks to him to his heart and he's forgiven of his sins and what more through this Idol which plainly shows it's the devil it's the devil that does it they don't just do things hurly some of them does but there's some real true worshippers of those things so he says I could tell you stories of how those devils and those Idols performing all kinds of things make blood come out of things and everything else they are devils what what is it when you begin to elevate something above the word of God and allow it to take root in your life the devil you you provide an opportunity for the devil to begin working in your mind it's the it's the devil working in your mind like in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 he said but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begal Eve through his subtility subtility to reason in someone's mind and begin to make them think a little bit differently than the word of God yeah but but but it are you sure are you really going to die is what the serpent told Eve but in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 it says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations casting down imaginations that the devil will put in your mind to make you think something different than what the word of God says and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought thought to The Obedience of Christ it's not just thoughts it's something spiritual at work now you think when the word of God goes to grabbing a hold of your heart you begin to meditate on the word of God it's it becomes not just thoughts it's the person of Jesus Christ that's speaking to you and dealing with you amen so think this morning that God can actually deal with your heart as you sit there and listen to the word of God that God can actually woo over you and and actually be birthed in you like he was laid there in that manger be birthed in your heart by by you hearing the word of God and you'll go away maybe and think well it's just a thought but it's not a thought it's a person now the same way you sit there and you open up your mind to the the thing the idolatrous things of the world and begin to listen to the things of the listen to movies and television shows and and fake things of this world and open up a channel to the devil and and it's not a thought it's not just a thought it's the devil it's actually a person a person speaking to you you and brother Brandon would say now there's teaching goes on that says the devil is just an evil thought you get no it ain't the Devil is a person the same people believes that the Holy Ghost is just a good thought you get but don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a person it's the person of Christ in spirit form you ought to think this morning that your thinking is actually influenced by a person that there are demonic forces at work and there are spiritual forces at work there's forces from both sides and whatever you want to have preeminence in your life is whatever you yield yourself to oh if you could like brother Aaron was saying this morning if you want to get closer to God then read the Bible and pray when you read the Bible and pray and begin to meditate upon God's word it begins to allow a channel for God's spirit to move in your life and the same thing when you begin to meditate on the things of this world and think about the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life and all those things that begins to allow the de devil to move in your life Satan began there's a quote where he said Satan began at the principal part to cause the spirit of man your mind to doubt God's word god began at the principle part to lay his word in that spirit and your mind accepts it and grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word of God and that's the thing that's got life in it it brings life into you oh to think if we just really recognize what this word is it's not just knowledge it's not just intellect but it's actually something that will birth Christ into your life that will actually change you and now the same thing with the devil's got a message too and he's got a message to bring death to you and his message is that your life is purposeless that there's no meaning to your life that there's no nothing but heartache and depression I thank God that God has given us the the weapon to defeat our adversary the weapon if we'll take a hold of God's word like brother Aaron was saying this morning you don't have to deal with depression and anxiety but you you've got the weapon to put him under your feet put him under your feet just like Christ did there on the cross where he put He died on the cross so that we you don't have to you don't have to deal with any of the stuff that the devil throws at you you can if you take a hold of God's word and let it begin to change you it will change your thinking it will take away that depression it will take away those depressive thoughts it will take away those thoughts where you think it's you're beyond hope and you're beyond salvation and you're beyond this and that why because it's the word of God that's changing you amen now now listen on both sides neither one is a hypocrite he said have you got that that worshipper that idolatry is not a hypocrite he actually is getting a hold of something that's in that Idol because it comes back on him he does something gets it from that Idol which is a myth God not a real one worshippers genuinely believe the idol brings them something in turn Amen in other words there's an emotional and spiritual interaction but rooted in deception now now I I think why it's important to kind of belabor these things is aren't you glad when you know that you've got the real that you're not looking at something fake you're not looking at something that the world has lifted up and and made some kind of a fake God a fake something that you could look at but you know what the word of God says and you know what the your purpose in life is and you know what God has done for you and you you can look both boldly it's like it's almost like it's like Christmas again where where the world looks at Santa Claus and all those other things but you can look at it differently you can look at it knowing that God has birthed his life in your heart and God has changed you and it's something different because you know the real meaning of it many times the devil gets into those things and the devil gets into meeting sometimes and impersonates himself as God I find people brother R say coming to the Altar and when blind sayings of blind teachers they'll say just open up forget everything make your mind a blank you'll become an Elijah you'll become this or that what a lie that's to open up your soul to all kinds of devil Spirits do you realize what he's saying when we come to church when we read our Bible we're not blanking out our mind but we're looking soberly steadfastly into the word of God and that is what your faith that is what your Christianity that's what everything is based upon on the word of God not just blanking your mind out not just oh that's that's that's where the the the challenge with really framing up what prayer is because if you go in prayer like a Buddhist or a seik or Jane or whatever and just pray with your mind blanked out or meditate or whatever then you're not going to get anywhere and you might open up yourself to some wrong thing but if you meditate and pray based upon the word of God then God can begin to move in your heart and in your life he said I've seen good people and Pentecostal people pastors who didn't understand people get into hysterics and fall into transes and everything like that and do things and finally run them into the in insane institution but it was opening up their heart innocent people and Devils came in and taking place there is a real devil oh what is it devils in Disguise so many people today opening opening their hearts to the wrong thing you get a spirit all right but many times it contradicts the word saying the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as this or that remember that's a devil under the disguising of Christianity now you see what he's really saying you go and sit in a meeting and and and all they're preaching about is money and trying to get your money that that ain't the word of God you said you sit in a meeting and they begin to tell you well the days of Miracles have passed if you want healing it's it's too late they had healing in the early church but it's too late for you to get healed now that that ain't the word of God if you sit in a church and they're telling you to to be baptized in the name of of of of the Father Son and Holy Ghost when nobody in the Bible was ever baptized that way other than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then that's contrary to the word of God when they're when you sit in a church and they're telling you things contrary to the word of God they're lifting up something else higher than the word of God and it's not the spirit of Christ because the spirit of Christ comes to the word every time and the spirit of Christ cannot deny his word in 1 Timothy 4:1 it says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils oh you better believe the devil's got some Doctrine and their seducing Spirits sneaky Spirits sneaky spirits that will make themselves look like something that's correct there something that's good but but behind it it's a lie a lie just just a lie just is wrong as Santa Claus is wrong it's it's if Santa Claus is it it matters whether it's true or not then the word of God matters whether it's true or not and 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and no Marvel for Satan himself is TR transformed into an angel of Light right and brother R would say he'd said how how did a pagan come to worship and I I'm going to close in just a moment I'm not I don't plan to keep you long but we'll just look at some of these thoughts and then we'll close in a minute here how did a pagan come to worship he'd go to the temple and find the priest then he'd given him an offering for so much money and then there' be maybe in one Temple there might might be more than many many different kinds of gods you go to Rome and they had that seven mile W wall around the city of Rome and right there in the inside of the wall they had 400 temples to pretty much every kind of God that you could ever want uh you know and and you go over to India today and they've got Gods with eight arms and gods with elephant heads and gods of all different kind of permutations and every every kind of thing that you could look for so the Pagan priest he would go to him and he'd give him some kind of money and the Pagan priest would give him back a candle just a regular tow of candle and then the worshipper take that candle and then he'd go over to that certain altar of this God that he wanted to talk to and on this altar was fire where the sacrifice would be burned at the Statue the big bronze Temple or Idol and he took this candle and lit it from the fire Altar and he lit the candle he went over and you know maybe maybe he he he put that candle lit the at the foot of the altar where the God was so that maybe the the God would know which which Idol to go into is what what the point he's trying to make and then he would go back out on the floor of the Tabernacle and there he would prostrate himself on the floor and then they made an offering and he said that was the kind of the first church that was what the the the RO the the first pilgrims of the Gospel when they came to wrong found was these people in this kind of a worship where they would and he said now in my travel I've noticed that idolatry hasn't changed and neither has true Christianity changed that that that idolatry has still carried over where Jeremiah talking about how the women made cakes under Baal the son God and that same idolatry carried right over into the Roman Catholic church today where they take the that circular thing that cake and now they're taking communion with it as a symbol of going you could trace it all the way back to Baal where in the bible Jesus said that when they took communion the bread was broken it was broken not a little round cake to symbolize the Sun or something but it was broken like his body there on the cross and he said the Roman priest adopted this by taking and making the communion instead of a broken parcel like the body of Christ they would make it round like the Sun or the moon now it we've got to stay right with the word because anything contrary to the word is wrong he' say any teaching of any church Let It Be Baptist me Presbyterian Methodist Pentecostal or whatever it may be that don't stay letter by letter with this Bible is wrong so how you going to add these Pagan idol worship symbols making three gods out of one and all these other Pagan Affairs which the early church never taught it and was against it stay right with the word and you're always right but when you get off that word you'll go anywhere now you can see how you look at these these videos of things of different churches I we went we went to a church recently where they had you know the pride flag on the wall now tell me where that is in the Bible and see how you begin to be get lifted up with your own understanding and and begin to that that's that's true Modern Age idolatry where people are sitting there in church and they're listening to something contrary to the word but they're accepting it as though they're getting something from God and just as they made a golden calf there under that mountain where they were waiting for Moses made it out of the imagination of their mind now they're framing up what they expect God to be from the imagination of their mind and they made of an idol that matches what they think it should be well I think God is a God where he just loves anybody whatever you know and God God does love us he wants us to come to church in whatever our condition is but you're not going to stay that way you're going to be changed to be conformed to the image of the word of God and that's what your purpose is you were predestinated to be conformed to the image of the Son of God you are predestinated to match up and line up your life with the word of God and the word of God is our Baseline standard so if the word of God says that it's unseemly for men to lie with men or whatever then you go to a church and you got a pride flag you're off the word if it's if if Santa Claus is a lie it's a lie if if all these doctrines of the world is a lie it's a lie see I'm so glad today that we've got the truth we can look steadfastly into the word of God and have a present tense revelation of what God is doing in this age and know now that's real Christianity to know that God that we're not looking at some fake Idol and expecting to get something back and we're not being changed at all but we think we're hearing the truth but we're looking steadfastly into the word of God and we're hearing back the truth God is speaking to us and it's actually changing our lives and changing our thinking it's changing it's not leaving us in the condition where we were but it's changing us and bringing us out now now brother around he' tell this story about how he was in a meeting at a big Pentecostal church and he was preaching the word and this lady jumped up one night and and he said I I knew she was going to jump up the next night the first night she jumped up he said I saw her she had she she's not even living a life that conforms to the word her life you can tell you can take one look at her and he said she had a skin tight suit on she had bobbed hair and she's going to get up jump up and tell him where he's wrong behind the pulpit he said that night he said a woman jumped up speaking in tongues and interrupted the alra call and that night when I come back in Billy met me out there and said you know what that woman said she had another message tonight she was going to give and I looked at the woman Bob tear a dress on so tight looked like she was poured into it sitting up there fixing her hair pulling up her stockings I knowed she was going to jump up and she jumped up and I said sit down she just kept on I said do you hear me sit down oh my and when I went out that night now now this is the Modern Age the modern perception of things people get real UPS set when the word of God is preached in truth and power there was four or five of them guys she had some people to back her up back up her false Doctrine met me out there said you grieve the spirit I said any spirit that I grieve with the word of God ought to be grieved I said don't the bible say that the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet he said but but you're now this is how this is how the modern age is so twisted up in our thinking in the in the thinking he said but you're teaching the word now ain't that the most important thing and see the world has gotten away from the word until to the point where you preach longer than 15 minutes and it's like this is not what I come to church for you come to church for entertainment and all other kind of coffee and everything El that's what the world comes to church for but a real boring and Christian wants the word of God because that's where they get their strength from that's what Clos closed them in the arm of a real believer the the helmet of salvation and the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace and all those things it's the word of God that's clothing you now you're but you're teaching the word and he I said that's what I'm standing by he said she had something fresh and new from heaven now that's the definition of idolatry somebody coming along it ain't got nothing to do with the word it ain't got nothing to do at all but she got something fresh and new from heaven and that's what the world rather have something different from that if that isn't he said if that isn't back to Roman Catholicism I don't know what is let every man's word be a lie and every Spirit be a lie and God's word be the truth God's word first oh you see what Roman Catholicism becomes it's a lot of man-made ideas people pray into dead Saint to their dead relatives and you're not a saint until you die and all all kinds of things that are just man made ideas that don't even come from scripture Peter was never in Rome but the churches buil on him and Priests can't get married but Peter had a wife and all it's all made up and Ma just just out of man's ideas and then that Harlot that the Bible talks about had a lot of daughters and it spread out into all this denominational system do you know what a denomination is it's putting structure around the word of God to bind it so that you can't keep moving on and it creates a a band a bond around it well we we've got it figured out we've got it figured out and you can't keep moving on if God reveals something else to you later on you're stuck because that denomination will pull you back to what they say is right and you'll never be able to move on past the structure of that denominational system which is the daughter of the mother Harlot the Roman Catholic system so they formed that first church the first Roman Catholic Church oh the reason why this is important is because in Revelation chapter 10 a mighty Angel come down from God out of Heaven A Mighty Angel come down with an open book a mighty Angel come down and he put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea amen one foot on the land Hallelujah you take one of those feet and lift it up and and you'd be looking at all these denominational systems that Roman Catholic system now aren't you glad that because you've looked into the word of God in this age your foot was put on all of those ble wow maybe maybe you didn't come out of it but you now you can look back and you're you're in a different state of your thinking where you know how to be baptized and your foot is now on all that wrong Doctrine your foot is on on those wrong doctrines of how to be baptized and how to be born again and how to do this and how to do that and your foot is on it because Christ come down with an open book and put his foot on the land and the Sea he put his foot on the sea where that that creature come up out of the O up out of the sea in Revelations 13 he put his foot on all of those things all those wrong things so that you could have dominion [Music] too let me skip over some of this arenus said the word of God is like a fine bunch of nice big jewels that was placed out to make a statue of a great mighty king it said Creeds dogmas denominations take those beautiful jewels and make the form of a dog out of it and deceive the ignorant of the the word this they do to corrupt the words of God and to bring a reproach upon it oh to think what a picture that paints that the word of God is like a a a bunch of jewels in the shape of a king and that denominational structure will take those jewels and make it look like a dog to deceive the ignorant of the word you try to make the word of God say something to fit your organization you're taking the jewels out of the Great King's body and making an image of a dog or a fox or a hog or something out of it oh that's why this this gospel message that we've heard was given to give Liberty to so that we can know what we believe and and carry us away from all the structures and all the limitations all the nianis and all to to to actually turn loose the spirit of God back in the church again it matters what you believe amen you know where you got Christmas he would say as we about to close Christ is born in April but what did they do the solar system is slowing up now as it gets away each day getting a little longer a little shorter and a little shorter and from the 20th until the 25th is when the Sun God had his birthday there's about five days there that's when the Roman circus in that time the celebration of the son God's birthday at that time and now you see what you got now they said make it the son God they take it Son of God and the whole thing is Pagan to begin with and the people on the streets with their high heeled shoes and they're twisting up and down the streets and running into stores and here the other day my wife was telling me someone said I don't know what to get Daddy said brother's going to get him a cord of whiskey and the other one said he was going to get him some champagne and one said well I'm going to get him a poker set celebration of Christmas Pagan devil worship Hallelujah now that's where the celebration of Christmas becomes wrong when you get away from the word of God Amen oh what we need to do is get away from the word of God Assemblies of God Four Square Pentecostal Oneness come back to the word of God he said quit some of these here denominational Idols denominational Sphinx they Bewitched themselves the spirit of the devil into these denominational Idols do you know that denomination is an idol yes why is it an idol cuz you say are you you a Christian well I'm a presbyterian but that ain't the question are you a Christian I'm a Methodist are you a Christian I'm Pentecostal and you're elevating something up you're looking at something else than than what the word says a Christian is that's not the answer to the question that don't mean no more than what you're a hog or a dog or a skunk has no more to do with it you know what idolatry is it's a Dead image a Dead image of a mythical god it's something that you can look at and it has no life in it and and today you look around at the churches of the day and you just can't hardly find one that's got real life in it life where people are being changed not not leaving the doors and walking right back out in the world and looking like the world again but but changed when you come into a church where the spirit of God is moving people are walking out the doors and they don't look like the world and they don't talk like the world and they're acting different because they've been changed all that drinking and smoking and carry on has dropped away because the word of God got a hold of their life now that's what real Christianity is Christianity is living images of a living God not not a Dead image of a mythical god but a living image of a living God and now we've been made partakers of his Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God why by humbling oursel to his death and Reckoning ourself nothing then the Holy Ghost comes in and lifts it lifts us up what what is the Living God it's the word in you making itself real now that's what Christianity is really about and that's what Christmas is really about that God would come down and and live in that little manger that God himself would be tabernacled in that little baby laying in there in that manger and that's what Christmas T this morning is really about that God can come and Tabernacle himself in you and make you a living representation of himself that is God himself tabernacling himself and you walking your feet using your hands and using your eyes and using your mouth to speak Liberty and help to somebody else now that means that if you're part of the body of Christ that you got a purpose that you've got a reason for being here this morning you've got a reason for being here on this Earth no matter how little you are how small you are now now see he said look Christ is the head of the body and wherever the head is the body's with it where my body where my head goes it takes my body with it and now we have got that picture of the cloud that we look at the cloud over Arizona that come years ago you know that's a sign if if you can see the sign of the head that's a sign that the body is here too and you are part of that body and it don't matter whether you're a big part of the body a notable part or a little small part of that body no matter where you are in that body you have you can have dominion over the devil brother R would say look you say but brother random I'm the least one the least part of the body would be the bottom of Jesus's feet but if you're the least part of the body that means you still got your foot on the devil's neck oh I was thinking I was sitting back there in the study reading that story of how Joshua Fought the the five amalaki Kings and when he defeated all those kings they went and hid in the cave and they drug them out and he he brought brought all those kings before his people and he told his people go take your foot and put it on the neck of those kings and you know that's what this gospel has giv you power to do you don't have to take nothing from the devil anymore if you're the least part of the body then you still got your foot on the devil's neck that means you don't have to put up with depression you don't have to put up with that anxiety you don't have to put up with wondering what you're doing here that's what the gospel is for to give you purpose and meaning in your life to know that you were predestinated to be a living a living Idol a living God using your human flesh that's why in First Corinthians it said for Heath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifested that he is accepted which did put all things under him so he said brother Bram I got no power neither do I I don't have any power well brother brandham I'm a weakly so am I but I'm not depending in my strength it ain't my strength now now aren't you glad that he framed it up this that way amen so many times we come to a church service and we feel like we got something to prove we we struggle in our mind well I got to have faith I got to I got to prove to everybody that I I'm a real Christian but when you look at it this way you don't have to prove nothing it's God that does the prove and all you got to do is believe him if you got Affliction in your body if you've got cancer or a migraine or a backache like I had the other day just believe God and God will come on the and take it from you take it away why because you ain't got to prove nothing it's all him God is the one that's doing The Proven he said it's like a traffic cop the the CRA traffic cop many times I've walked down the streets of Atlanta and you see a little cop out there with the cars whizzing by and he just steps out in the road and everybody all the cars stop but but that car a big old Mac Truck could just run him right over but that cop will step right out why cuz he's got his uniform on and that uniform is respected and you know the Bible says put on the whole armor of God and that's our uniform put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil what is that armor the the helmet of salvation and so forth all those things it's your armor is Jesus Christ your armor is the Holy Ghost now that's a real Christmas story that God would fill you with his holy ghost so he could use you he said not that you're strong you're nothing as the musicians come forward but it's what's behind you why you are dead you join the Army you join the police force you're going to keep law and control of these Devils that's right you're on the police force the whole thing's behind you see you're reckoned dead you're nothing you couldn't stop nothing but your Authority that's been given you because you are raised and setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the devil recognizes that amen you believe that this morning yes amen that the devil recognizes real Holy Ghost Authority you know I I'm so glad that we can real have real Holy Ghost fill meetings where the devil don't feel welcome that's what I when I come to church I want to make the devil so uncomfortable that if I'm that battling with a mind battle the devil got to leave I to make the battle devil so uncomfortable he don't know what to do oh and brother Brandon want to say now as we just kind of finish up here and just clinch it he say the badge of your Authority is not a name of a denomination but it's the power the power of the resurrection of Christ in each individual Life As We Stand to our feet that's your power your power is not well I'm a presbyterian or a Methodist or even a message believer or whatever but your power is that I'm a Christian I'm a born again Christian and the word of God has been received in my heart and I know God for him myself I know him because I met him I met him like Moses did met him in the burning bush I met him like Paul on the road there I met him like so many others before I know him for myself and I'm not seeking my identification from a label or a church or identification like that but I know him for myself that's where you get your power from amen amen let's bow our heads in our hearts Lord Jesus I'm so glad that you've given us something that we can have confidence in Lord we've been clothed like L Zoe coming out Lord depicting the bride of Christ in this day clothed with the word and your word is clothed us clothe us Lord Lord like where Paul described it's the AR our armor Lord when we're clothed with with your righteousness not anything that we do not something that we've made up or concocted some kind of a myth but we're clothed with a genuine unfailing word of God it gives us power over the enemy Lord Jesus I want to declare this morning that the enemy is defeated the devil is defeated and whatever needs your people have Lord I iure them Lord to to claim it now Lord God because you already paid the price and now it's just up to us to believe it and I pray God if anyone has a special need this morning Lord that you'll strengthen their faith help them Lord to look to your promise Lord Jesus Lord we're not looking at some kind of a man-made Idol or a man-made system but we're looking boldly into the present tense revealed word for the sage Lord God lord just as you come down lord god with the open book to take dominion and put your H your feet upon the land and upon the Sea Lord as we could as we take a hold of your word you've given us power Lord Jesus just like like the amalaki kings were under Joshua's feet Lord the enemy will be under our feet and I pray God lord Jesus if we can accept it Lord Jesus Lord be with your people this morning bless the remainder of this service let's just worship Him Now how [Music] great sing with me how great is our God and
