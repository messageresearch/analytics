[24:45] know for a fact they want to be here
[24:46] Lord but the spirit is willing as Jesus
[24:50] said but the flesh is weak well father
[24:52] we pray that you should strengthen our
[24:53] flesh that you would strengthen us like
[24:55] Caleb being 80 something years old he
[24:57] said give me my mountain
[24:59] so it didn't bother him he was looking
[25:01] at a promise he wasn't looking at his
[25:03] flesh if we looked at our flesh every
[25:05] day we'd never go to work we'd never go
[25:07] to church but father we as our brother
[25:09] said we got to overcome we got to fight
[25:11] our way through this this is a birth and
[25:13] then this is life that we got to live
[25:15] through we got to fight our way out of
[25:16] the womb and fight our way into heaven
[25:19] so father I pray that you'd help us in
[25:21] that battle you said you would and as
[25:23] we're going to talk about you today Lord
[25:24] you anoint the word that we're about to
[25:26] speak in Jesus name we pray
[25:28] amen
[25:30] still on the son of man part 96 in the
[25:32] beginning was the word where was with
[25:33] God and the Word was God and that word
[25:35] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's
[25:39] what you brought here today you brought
[25:41] your flesh but if you have the Holy
[25:44] Ghost today you brought God in your
[25:47] flesh into this building all right and
[25:50] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[25:52] us and we beheld his glory now when uh
[25:54] speaking just for a few minutes about
[25:56] beheld is Glory how are you going to
[25:58] behold his glory
[26:00] in a book no oh a picture
[26:03] no person
[26:06] behold his glory in a person all right
[26:09] so we're going to be whole that's what
[26:10] we're doing now we're beholding the
[26:12] glory of the stature of a perfect man or
[26:15] the stature of Jesus Christ all right
[26:17] and the glory of the only begotten of
[26:19] the father
[26:20] full of grace and truth you may be
[26:22] seated in the Lord at his Blessing to
[26:23] the reading of the word now we'll go
[26:24] through II Peter 1 5 and I told you
[26:26] since June this morning I'm going to
[26:28] take a little bit uh we're trying to get
[26:32] through these virtues but God's kind of
[26:33] taken us on little rabbit trails and and
[26:35] that's okay as long as we get back to
[26:37] the regular Trail all right and besides
[26:40] this
[26:41] giving all diligence act to your faith
[26:43] virtue and divert you knowledge and
[26:45] acknowledge Temperance and Temperance
[26:46] patience and patience godliness and
[26:48] we're going to get the godliness Maybe
[26:50] next week the Bible tells us because you
[26:54] need to be patient with me
[26:56] as brother Jack was talking about that's
[26:58] really wonderful that he he kind of put
[26:59] the little exclamation point on on what
[27:02] we've been talking about patience but
[27:04] that's the way God works listen how many
[27:06] times you've been sitting in a in a
[27:07] service and and you swear that the pr
[27:09] the preacher that comes from from
[27:11] Arizona comes out here and preaches a
[27:13] sermon and y'all swear that I sit there
[27:15] and talked about you all the whole time
[27:16] all weekend no we don't that was the
[27:19] Holy Ghost doing his job
[27:21] through a man he yielded himself in the
[27:24] Holy Ghost knows what you need I don't
[27:25] know everything you need today but the
[27:27] Holy Ghost knows everything you need and
[27:28] he can bring it through the foolishness
[27:31] as the Bible says of preaching the Bible
[27:33] says in in your patience possess ye your
[27:37] soul
[27:38] First Timothy 3 16. that's what we might
[27:41] get to today may not
[27:43] says and without controversy now that's
[27:46] without anybody sitting down debating
[27:49] that's without anybody sitting wanting
[27:51] to know what your opinion is and your
[27:53] opinion is in your opinion it's without
[27:55] controversy
[27:57] now I wish we could stay on that for a
[27:59] while without controversy
[28:02] great is the mystery of godliness
[28:05] God was manifested in the flesh
[28:07] justified in the spirit scene of angels
[28:10] preached into the Gentiles believed on
[28:12] in the world and received up into the
[28:15] glory now guess what that's your same
[28:16] Journey
[28:18] that's your same Journey that's you
[28:21] so now let's look here just for a minute
[28:23] this is where I was we were looking and
[28:26] sometimes people look at you when you
[28:27] say well God had a plan well you know we
[28:30] sat down like brother John said we have
[28:31] a plan we we do a budget that's the way
[28:34] we do it with Dave Ramsey you do a
[28:36] budget you sit down and you make a plan
[28:38] you plan out what you're going to do uh
[28:41] you can tell people it's just wandered
[28:43] through life and not had a plan
[28:45] all right amen
[28:47] and then you've seen people that had a
[28:49] plan and purpose of what they're doing
[28:51] so God had a plan and a purpose and
[28:53] brother Brown said we'll see it a little
[28:55] bit that he foreign knew who would want
[28:57] to be saved
[28:58] so let's look at the plan just for a
[29:00] minute because I want to make a point
[29:01] here in just a second
[29:03] Jesus died for one purpose and that was
[29:05] to save those who God foreknew would be
[29:07] saved now we're going to talk a minute
[29:08] about predestination but remember that
[29:11] as I was talking to a brother
[29:13] um Saturday
[29:15] or Friday and uh we were talking about
[29:17] you know you look at a you look at a a
[29:20] crowd of people and you go to these
[29:22] meetings and camps and different things
[29:24] and you see 300 400 500 people and they
[29:28] come under the message Under the
[29:29] Umbrella of the message of the hour
[29:31] now listen we're all anointed for a
[29:34] purpose but some are anointed for this
[29:36] some are anointed for that I can't play
[29:38] an instrument I pray that God's anointed
[29:41] me to be able to preach instead of
[29:42] playing an instrument so we have each
[29:45] have a place like brother Brown was
[29:46] talking about each each joint the Bible
[29:50] says each joint supplies you need these
[29:52] hands
[29:53] if I have hands man you wouldn't be able
[29:55] I wouldn't be able to carry something
[29:56] out it wouldn't you wouldn't be able to
[29:57] do your job maybe
[29:59] so God brings us together under this
[30:02] umbrella of the message but then you
[30:04] have to do what brother Brown says you
[30:05] have to go all right there's mate
[30:06] believers
[30:07] True Believers unbelievers make
[30:10] Believers True Believers so you got to
[30:12] separate them out God does God sits
[30:14] there and he looks at and he separates
[30:15] them out we don't
[30:17] but buy your fruits you'll be known
[30:20] then there's a group that's going to be
[30:21] a foolish virgin and they're gonna
[30:23] they're gonna separate their self out
[30:27] because this is a
[30:29] if not you know you know God to do
[30:31] remember what brother Brown said if I
[30:32] was God I tell you one time
[30:35] I tell you one time and that'd be it I
[30:37] wouldn't stand there and preached 75 or
[30:39] a thousand years or 200 years or 120
[30:42] years he said I tell if I've got I tell
[30:44] you one time if you didn't do what I
[30:46] said then out you go but God's a good
[30:48] god he's a patient God and he's patient
[30:51] with each one of us he knows our needs
[30:53] and he knows the things to give us
[30:57] that's right here God foreknew
[31:00] who would be saved so by foreknowledge
[31:01] he foreign knew that you would want it
[31:04] so here you are sitting in the message
[31:05] Church
[31:07] and you've got all these different
[31:08] groups inside of that
[31:10] then you got foolish version
[31:12] then like one brother said he said you
[31:14] got the sleeping version some of y'all
[31:15] need to wake up but y'all are not asleep
[31:18] yet so I said yeah wait till this
[31:20] afternoon but remember
[31:22] the five wise virgins this late fall
[31:25] asleep
[31:26] okay right right it was ten and all 10
[31:30] of them fell asleep they all ten woke up
[31:33] but they were some that had what a plant
[31:35] God had a plan for these people and he
[31:38] also had a plan to fulfill with these
[31:39] people even the 144 000 brother Branham
[31:42] he tells us he said that's the remnant
[31:46] now he said it's the same material
[31:48] as they would with my shirt or my jacket
[31:50] or my vest they started with this big
[31:52] piece of material and they cut out well
[31:55] they didn't throw that piece away they
[31:58] maybe used it for something else to make
[31:59] this that make a pair of socks or make a
[32:01] a handkerchief or something out of it
[32:04] that's the remnant that God's Gonna Save
[32:06] the Jews the 144 000 and
[32:08] and where with the plan of God in the
[32:11] plan of God everybody with me on this
[32:13] and we'll try to make it where you got
[32:14] to figure out where you are today right
[32:17] when we realize who we are and what
[32:22] we're doing here right
[32:23] right we'll be in Invincible Army some
[32:25] people said well I don't know if I'm
[32:26] this I don't know if that you better
[32:27] just put your estate down somewhere and
[32:29] say this is it right because you're
[32:31] going to be a part of some group
[32:34] right
[32:35] right
[32:36] True Believers night Believers and
[32:39] unbelievers one of the three all right
[32:41] so then you take that and you take okay
[32:44] we've got a group now that's
[32:46] predestinated to be saved
[32:50] all right believe in the Lord Jesus
[32:52] Christ and thou shalt be saved there's
[32:53] our group
[32:55] and by with me
[32:57] then that group then stops
[33:00] to be the foolish virgin does it go on
[33:03] to receive the Holy Ghost then you've
[33:05] got a bride
[33:07] you got a bride that
[33:10] that La ghost receives the message of
[33:12] the hour and begins to live a good
[33:14] Christian Life
[33:16] then you've got another group that's
[33:18] predestinated
[33:20] they're predestinated brother Brown said
[33:22] to adoption because not everybody is
[33:25] predestinated to adoption
[33:30] that's why I'm telling you you got to
[33:32] get yourself into the plan somewhere
[33:35] find out where you are find out where
[33:37] you're not
[33:39] and that's by the foolishness of
[33:41] preaching brother John what he preached
[33:43] today to me that just that helps you
[33:45] place your mind not just so much on
[33:47] dollars and cents
[33:49] but since
[33:51] s-e-n-s-a
[33:52] not c-e-n-t-s the sense that you have
[33:56] that same sense that you apply to that
[33:58] plan he's talking about you need to
[33:59] apply to the plan of God
[34:01] amen right amen figure out where you're
[34:04] at
[34:05] figure out what you're doing here why am
[34:06] I here Lord you ever just sit down and
[34:08] said why me Lord why am I here what what
[34:10] am I doing here
[34:12] so there's that group that's adopt this
[34:15] predestinated to adoption we'll read it
[34:16] here in just a few minutes I'll let
[34:18] brother random lay the plan down for us
[34:20] a little bit
[34:21] but I want you to understand so that the
[34:23] plan is adoption so there's a group of
[34:25] people that's going to go all the way up
[34:28] the statue of perfect man to there where
[34:29] it says Holy Spirit and they're going to
[34:31] be a Powerhouse of God
[34:34] but then there's another group of people
[34:38] oh don't get quiet
[34:40] that group's gonna take a body change
[34:44] that group's gonna be the Abraham group
[34:47] the Enoch group we'll talk about it in
[34:49] just a few minutes
[34:51] but that's a group that's a as it goes
[34:54] more and more to the Head it gets
[34:57] narrower and narrower and narrower
[35:00] brother Branham said one time a knife
[35:02] blade Edge
[35:05] now it don't look too much but you take
[35:07] that knife blade and you put it under a
[35:09] microscope it goes to nothing if it's a
[35:12] very sharp blade it just goes to nothing
[35:14] that's how fine it's going to be
[35:18] and God didn't decide which one you got
[35:21] in
[35:22] you did
[35:28] that's your perfect man he would that
[35:30] all would have a desire in their heart
[35:33] to be
[35:34] headstone people which would be the son
[35:37] of man
[35:39] the part of God
[35:40] knows that we can understand now
[35:42] excuse me
[35:44] ticker flea one
[35:46] got the back of my head
[35:48] we don't have to laugh so hard
[35:52] so Jesus look Jesus died then for one
[35:54] purpose
[35:56] but
[35:57] but he knew who would or who what
[36:01] he didn't own a cross I don't think he
[36:04] was a human dying
[36:05] the father knew Joel that's the same
[36:08] person yeah it is but that remember he
[36:09] moved over in another form called a son
[36:11] and remember brother Brown said he
[36:13] didn't know all things as a son
[36:16] come on somebody remember he didn't know
[36:18] about what was going to happen to to
[36:20] what to Elijah and Moses showed up and
[36:23] told him about the resurrection right
[36:25] right so there are certain things to me
[36:27] and you that that we've got to hang on
[36:30] and hang on and hang on and hang on to
[36:34] and then if you let go then whose
[36:37] problem is it
[36:39] our problem your problem my problem when
[36:42] I let go of God because he said he'd
[36:45] never let go of us but he knows who who
[36:48] is going to be saved and who not
[36:49] somebody asked brother Brown said did
[36:50] Brother Brown
[36:53] God knows who exactly will be saved he
[36:55] said correct
[36:56] but we don't as ministers we don't we
[36:59] don't put people in classes we put our
[37:01] own self in class
[37:03] amen so let's continue on so now that
[37:06] there is a plan remember the the
[37:08] definition of a plan is a method of
[37:11] achieving an end
[37:13] that's what a plan is when you're going
[37:14] to build a house you start with plans
[37:17] and when you get finished with that plan
[37:19] you walk into the house
[37:22] so it has an end to it like like I've
[37:25] always said sin has an expiration date
[37:27] sin has an end to it but God doesn't
[37:30] have an end to it the blessings of God
[37:32] doesn't have an end to it
[37:34] but there's a detailed plan that God had
[37:37] and a purpose for everybody to be on the
[37:40] face of the Earth
[37:41] you got to figure out which one you are
[37:44] why are you saying that I don't want
[37:45] anybody to get lost in the well we got
[37:48] to be this Great Mighty get born again
[37:51] get born again know that you're in that
[37:53] group
[37:56] then say Lord help me through these
[37:59] virtues so that I can understand more
[38:02] about you than I did when I became a
[38:04] Christian ever how many years ago two
[38:06] three four ten fifteen twenty fifty ever
[38:08] how many are ten minutes
[38:11] that's right God knew there was going to
[38:14] be somebody saved and there had to be a
[38:17] preparation so see he knew somebody's
[38:19] going to be safe so he had to make a way
[38:21] for him to get back
[38:22] he knew somebody was gonna what just
[38:26] take these say Lord give me these
[38:28] virtues so he had them there
[38:30] he displayed them
[38:32] well I don't know about that so you cut
[38:34] yourself off
[38:35] there had to be a preparation or a way
[38:38] made for them to be saved if there
[38:40] wasn't salvation wasn't possible
[38:43] so God for knowing that people would be
[38:47] saved knowing who they were he had to
[38:50] lay a plan down
[38:53] now you say brother Brown then God knows
[38:55] exactly who would be saved correctly why
[38:57] does he say he's not willing that then
[38:58] he should perish he isn't
[39:00] God is not willing than any he actually
[39:02] went to the Cross to save everybody what
[39:04] that wanted to be saved
[39:08] he isn't willing that any should perish
[39:10] but that all might come to repentance
[39:12] but the or in order to be God
[39:15] he has to know who will do it or he
[39:18] wasn't God because he's omnipotent he's
[39:20] I'm the president he's omniscient he
[39:23] knows everything he's at every place and
[39:25] all-powerful so for knowledge looks back
[39:27] and says that he foresaw this what he
[39:31] foresaw this
[39:33] today he first saw this right here today
[39:38] and knows that's the reason he could
[39:41] tell what the end was from the beginning
[39:42] what time are we in
[39:45] in time
[39:46] right we're not in the beginning time
[39:48] we're at the end time so I don't say
[39:51] forget about the beginning but don't
[39:52] worry about the beginning
[39:54] you worry about the end time
[39:58] and therefore knowing that all these
[40:00] marvelous days that we're living in now
[40:02] and to stand and witness and see the
[40:05] things that we now see God had to make a
[40:08] preparation
[40:09] for it
[40:13] what the Holy Ghost was given for
[40:16] cool the evening he'd come down and
[40:17] commune with him
[40:19] and he lost that Fellowship because sin
[40:20] would not let him do it and then he was
[40:23] made flesh and walked Among Us in order
[40:24] that he could come back again to man and
[40:27] live in man look and restore man to a
[40:29] state of communion with him again
[40:31] I know this is simple but you're gonna
[40:33] have to get this Plan of Redemption down
[40:35] before we can go and rise on up into
[40:37] these virtues
[40:39] know that you want them
[40:42] and his brother John said listen I'ma
[40:44] read you a quote because
[40:46] I want us to understand when they went
[40:47] in the promise they went into the
[40:49] Promised Land
[40:51] right they were promised people in a
[40:54] Promised Land but they had to fight for
[40:57] every inch of ground once they got there
[40:59] so it's not picnic it's a battle
[41:03] he can give us forks and spoons to fight
[41:05] with
[41:08] that's to eat with
[41:10] restore man to a state of communion with
[41:12] him again and give him back his
[41:13] god-given right that's what he did
[41:15] that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[41:17] it's the father again God the Father
[41:19] dwelling in you look working out his
[41:22] plans
[41:23] to finish his Plan of Redemption working
[41:27] through you making you a co-worker with
[41:30] him heirs and join heirs with Christ
[41:32] giving you a place giving you a part for
[41:35] your Fallen lost brother and sister
[41:37] giving you his spirit and his love to go
[41:40] hunt to lost as he did in the Garden of
[41:42] Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's
[41:45] what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a
[41:47] woman look when it strikes your heart
[41:49] and takes us Abode there's a thirst and
[41:51] hunger for lost souls he's out here
[41:55] no it's me for no more
[41:59] no I won't everybody say
[42:02] when I walk in the store and I look at
[42:04] people and I go van if you just knew
[42:06] just give your heart to God
[42:09] and you see people like say bro John you
[42:11] see people it's just you know just debt
[42:13] Laden and they can't make ends meet and
[42:16] and they're in their grocery carts that
[42:18] you know that full of junk
[42:21] yeah junk
[42:23] and you're like Lord of Mercy
[42:27] anyway that's what's the matter with the
[42:29] meetings today there's not enough Spirit
[42:31] touch in it to go for the souls of the
[42:34] Lost and the dying it's more to make a
[42:37] name or a church or a building or a
[42:39] denomination instead of a soul-winning
[42:41] program how pitiful
[42:44] today as we meet today is it not that
[42:46] you want I I don't want to come in here
[42:48] and want me saved I want you safe
[42:51] I do I want you to say I'm a servant
[42:54] servants are wanting people I get up and
[42:56] I look in the mirror and I make sure as
[42:58] as mama always tells us check your tire
[43:00] check your
[43:02] uh coattail or your shirt tail and your
[43:05] zipper and your hair to make sure
[43:06] everything's good before you walk
[43:08] outside she always told Daddy to do that
[43:10] check this check this check this and I
[43:12] say Lord God
[43:14] whether you throw me out in the ditch
[43:16] help somebody today help one person I
[43:20] don't care if it's a whole group because
[43:21] some of y'all already asleep it's not
[43:23] helping you at all
[43:28] now God's secret mystery he had before
[43:30] the world began now back in the back
[43:33] part of God's mind see folks this is
[43:35] where we're going brothers and sisters
[43:37] if you're not in the mind of God you'll
[43:39] never get in the mind of God so you got
[43:41] to know and realize if you're born again
[43:43] today you are not just
[43:46] and the mind of God you are the mind of
[43:48] God
[43:49] all right and he got a plan and a
[43:51] purpose
[43:53] and there was something that he was
[43:55] trying and was going to achieve and look
[43:58] he had a motive in doing it
[44:00] in order to let himself be expressed
[44:02] because first it wasn't even a moon star
[44:04] out of molecule or anything he was God
[44:06] but he exactly wasn't God at that time
[44:08] because God's an object of worship there
[44:10] wasn't nothing to worship him so in his
[44:12] great mind he wanted these attributes to
[44:15] be expressed and thank God that he sent
[44:17] us a prophet that could go into the mind
[44:19] of God he says in the Christ the mission
[44:20] Garden let's go back into the back part
[44:22] of God's mind
[44:24] and let's see what God's thinking about
[44:28] because remember if it's a false
[44:30] doctrine that ain't the mind of God
[44:33] that's the mind of the devil there's
[44:35] only two powers
[44:38] and then him was love and him was Father
[44:40] and Son Savior and him was to be a
[44:42] Healer all these great attributes that
[44:44] we see already expressed they were in
[44:46] God so we need to know then that we need
[44:49] to add as our new birth we need to add
[44:52] to that if we're going to be in that
[44:54] group that wants more of God right all
[44:57] right amen some don't
[44:59] but you should
[45:01] you know why some people don't want more
[45:02] God they don't have any God in them
[45:07] well don't get quiet
[45:09] think about it
[45:12] but what's more important than anything
[45:13] else the word of God
[45:15] the word of God is more important
[45:16] anything else brother Brown will tell
[45:18] you the Bible tells you seek ye first
[45:19] the kingdom of God and then all these
[45:21] other things will be added to you we put
[45:23] everything in the world in front of the
[45:24] word of God and I'm included
[45:27] we we don't we insert things between us
[45:30] and God God does it except him
[45:33] we insert well I can't because I because
[45:37] I when we're going to start saying
[45:39] brother like brother said we're gonna
[45:40] start saying what God Said not what we
[45:42] said her not what your neighbor said or
[45:43] not what the other guy said or this guy
[45:45] said I'm worried about what God Said all
[45:47] right
[45:48] what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being
[45:51] home so that it can fit with the same
[45:52] kind of ministry he had when he went
[45:54] away that when he comes back now
[45:56] remember brother Brown I'm standing here
[45:58] let's see what is
[46:00] I can't remember where that where I got
[46:02] that quote from but he's standing in
[46:04] he's preaching this probably in the 60s
[46:07] because he's talking about holding a
[46:09] group of people that has the same kind
[46:11] of ministry he's standing there knowing
[46:14] that he has brought that Ministry on
[46:17] Earth
[46:18] he's brought the ministry of Jesus
[46:20] Christ the son of man message he's
[46:23] brought back to this earth and he's now
[46:25] trying to get a people to see it
[46:27] but he knows they're only a small group
[46:30] that honed group is going to be able to
[46:33] see it
[46:36] listen folks I don't want us to say well
[46:38] I've been in the message and I don't I
[46:40] don't why do we stamp dates
[46:43] well I've been in Memphis 40 years I've
[46:44] been in the next 20 years I've been here
[46:46] at this church 40 years
[46:47] well why you still act like you do if
[46:49] you've been in church 40 years
[46:52] praise the Lord anyhow
[46:54] but the same kind of ministry listen
[46:56] this this
[46:57] is your changer
[46:59] right Jesus Christ will change you and
[47:03] make your soul
[47:05] perfect
[47:07] but that's not all
[47:10] there's another group that's going to
[47:12] let the message of the hour dig deeper
[47:16] and get into the virtues of God and not
[47:19] have the virtue of your mama and your
[47:20] daddy and your brother and your sister
[47:21] you have the virtue of God yeah
[47:24] I want the traits and characteristics of
[47:27] him
[47:29] now a man's gonna fail every man that
[47:31] ever come out alone and said why they
[47:33] failed right you failed right then
[47:35] because you're going to die if God don't
[47:37] change your body
[47:39] but there's something inside
[47:42] his brother Louise
[47:44] your Soul's worth ten thousand worlds
[47:47] and you sit here and just fall asleep
[47:49] and you don't even say man some of y'all
[47:52] said man it'd crack your face open
[47:54] why you need if you don't what are you
[47:57] here for right right what do you hear go
[48:01] find you a ball game somewhere go find
[48:03] you something that stimulates your soul
[48:05] if there's no stimulate your soul you
[48:07] got an issue not with me you got an
[48:09] issue with God
[48:11] you're to walk in that door supercharged
[48:14] amen not just charged up supercharged
[48:16] and he's back to not hear from me and
[48:19] brother John or bro her brother Louise
[48:20] to hear from God
[48:22] that God's gonna talk to you
[48:25] I'm sorry we are so dilatory this church
[48:28] and every other Church
[48:31] we ought to be on fire this is it this

[49:36] kid was kicking a ball
[49:37] no and it wasn't gonna be but one to
[49:39] nothing

[49:45] you know you're not going to go to a
[49:47] soccer game and it'd be 52-54
[49:50] our 54 to 52. now football you do
[49:52] basketball you do

[50:11] Mill game was over
[50:14] it goes to screaming get that one point
[50:16] and then kids is running it one minute
[50:18] why they knew the game was fixing to be
[50:21] over
[50:26] upside down and upside though that's
[50:28] back and forth but they knew they had
[50:30] one minute somebody needed the score
[50:34] and it was a frenzy that's what it
[50:36] should be here
[50:37] [Music]
[50:39] and that's not working anything up
[50:41] that's coming from here out yes amen
[50:44] amen
[50:47] look that pyramid will stand again the
[50:50] house of God what is the house of God
[50:53] it's not bricks and mortars you
[50:55] will live again
[50:57] the Tree of Life
[50:59] is growing again
[51:01] listen to this
[51:02] Genesis 5 verse 22 now here is Enoch now
[51:06] what does Enoch type he types the
[51:08] rapturing or the translated Saints is
[51:11] that right
[51:12] he was translated without seeing death
[51:16] and what was his confession what was the
[51:20] Bible's commentary
[51:22] of Enoch
[51:24] he walked with God
[51:30] he didn't sit down with his finger stuck
[51:32] on his
[51:34] he walked with God
[51:38] even after he begotten Methuselah
[51:41] 300 years
[51:45] you think he was
[51:47] bored
[51:49] he lived 300 he lived 900 something
[51:51] years of self
[51:52] or 500 something years I'm sorry then he
[51:54] had a kid that lived 900 years
[51:57] and all the days I mean it was 365 years
[52:00] and here is the last commentary of Enoch
[52:03] and Enoch walk with God and he was not
[52:07] for God took him
[52:10] he was a great stonemason
[52:13] one of the greatest that ever lived
[52:15] because you know why his pyramids made
[52:17] it through the flood
[52:20] oh don't get quiet
[52:21] his pyramids made it through the flood
[52:23] they're still standing like they were
[52:25] seven thousand years ago 8 000 years ago
[52:28] he was a matter of why
[52:30] we had a master Stone Mason that came 2
[52:33] 000 years ago
[52:35] and he built the church
[52:37] and that church the gates of hell is
[52:39] going to try but it will not Prevail
[52:41] against it come on people we're letting
[52:44] it Prevail we're letting it happen
[52:47] it happened you know it's coming
[52:51] as we get older we know death is coming
[52:55] but do you know one thing for sure we're
[52:57] sitting here today I was thinking about
[52:58] coming to church
[53:01] I don't know the statistics I was going
[53:02] to look it up but I got caught up in the
[53:04] singing with y'all didn't look it up you
[53:06] know by the time this Church's service
[53:08] is over and we go out to eat that five
[53:10] or six thousand people in the United
[53:12] States have died
[53:16] over the world it's probably 10 15 000.
[53:18] I don't know you can Google it
[53:23] 50 people in in Georgia May die of a car
[53:26] wreck before in a car wreck before we
[53:27] get out of church service
[53:29] we're not guaranteed anything
[53:32] at all
[53:34] think about a group of people over there
[53:36] that was in Turkey not too long ago they
[53:38] were sitting comfortable in their homes
[53:39] their high rises and all that
[53:42] and within one minute
[53:45] seven or eight thousand of them died
[53:48] by that earthquake
[53:49] just like that
[53:52] what are you saying brother Wade we
[53:54] better get serious
[53:56] you are not guaranteed your next breath
[54:02] and as the song says do you want your
[54:04] lord to be satisfied with you
[54:08] there was another man Noah these are the
[54:11] generations of Noah Noah was a just man
[54:13] and perfect in his generations and Noah
[54:16] walked with God
[54:18] what is this this is a walk
[54:20] yeah now watch what brother Brown said
[54:22] in an adoption series you ready for this
[54:23] wake up because here it comes
[54:27] the land was provided and divvied up by
[54:30] Inspirations talking about the children
[54:32] of Israel going into the promised land
[54:34] everybody with me
[54:35] and each one I could take the scripture
[54:37] and show it to exactly that he put them
[54:39] into place where he was supposed to be
[54:40] now positionally that's what we're
[54:41] talking about now
[54:43] come on they got into the land and then
[54:45] they were placed where they're supposed
[54:46] to be
[54:47] how did the two and a half tribes was to
[54:49] stay across the river how did their
[54:51] mothers cried at their birth and each
[54:53] one had their place was supposed to be
[54:57] and after you're in that don't mean that
[54:59] you're free from war
[55:02] you still have to fight for every inch
[55:04] of ground you stand on so see Canaan did
[55:07] not represent Heaven because it's war
[55:10] and troubles and killings and fighting
[55:11] and so forth but it did represent this
[55:14] that it must be a perfect walk and
[55:18] there's where the church is failing
[55:20] today
[55:22] on that walk
[55:27] right we should believe brother man was
[55:28] a Prophet this is not my idea I'm just
[55:30] reading it right straight off of you
[55:32] well you're reading this when I'm
[55:33] reading it and I got a big old Red Bull
[55:35] letters
[55:36] do you know even your own behavior can
[55:40] knock somebody else out of getting
[55:42] healed
[55:43] so I Tell You Folks
[55:46] when you don't see me up here praying
[55:47] for nobody you'll know my hands up and
[55:49] the first thing I say is God do not let
[55:53] anything in my life hinder them from
[55:55] being healed oh brother you need to be
[55:57] over there praying with a machine no if
[56:00] I have something
[56:02] and if I stop it I'm gonna have to give
[56:04] an account for it right
[56:06] but if I can say God if they don't get
[56:08] their healing it's not because something
[56:10] that I'm doing or not doing
[56:13] do you know that even your own behavior
[56:15] can knock somebody else out of getting
[56:17] healed your misbehavior of unconfessed
[56:20] Sins Of You believers
[56:24] they didn't say unbelievers so let's
[56:27] take the make-believers and unbelievers
[56:28] out let's just talk to you Believers
[56:30] right now
[56:33] your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of
[56:35] You believers can cause this church to
[56:38] bitterly fail
[56:39] and at the day of judgment you'll be
[56:41] responsible for every bit of it oh you
[56:44] said now wait a minute brother well
[56:46] that's the truth think of it
[56:49] so think about that
[56:52] that's why
[56:54] that's why I'm telling you that
[56:56] everything that we do is not do's and
[56:58] don'ts
[57:00] if you'll really think about it I know
[57:01] it's on paper that that you should do
[57:03] this and shouldn't do that you got your
[57:04] Ten Commandments you got all these
[57:06] things you know you got all that you
[57:08] know dressing in there and we got all
[57:10] these things that we and then brother
[57:12] Brown comes up and in church order and
[57:14] I've got the book back there finally I
[57:16] found one that I could read
[57:18] um Church order and Doctrine and brother
[57:20] man said
[57:22] one time he says you can't wait for the
[57:24] doors to open to get in here to worship
[57:25] God
[57:26] next time he says 20 to 30 minutes
[57:29] before the service you need to be in
[57:30] here praying
[57:31] some of y'all get here two minutes
[57:33] before the service you know what you're
[57:34] doing you're dragging all them demons
[57:35] you got in here
[57:37] you talking about me yep you're two or
[57:39] three feet come in two or three minutes
[57:40] before the service starts yeah I'm
[57:42] talking about you
[57:45] but you get quiet all you want to but
[57:46] it's time for us if we don't get in this
[57:48] plan the plan is going to move on
[57:52] so there's a purpose for us to come
[57:54] don't come in here because brother
[57:56] wasted you got to be here 20 minutes
[57:57] full of service you
[58:01] you'll be a desire to get here early and
[58:03] to get up bro Graham even talks about
[58:05] coming to the altar he said if you want
[58:07] to quietly slip down here and pray he
[58:08] said you come down here and pray
[58:10] he even says one time if you want to be
[58:12] prayed for let them pray for you for the
[58:14] service Stars
[58:16] hmm
[58:17] we wait till the end when all the
[58:19] anointing well if you need help at first
[58:22] I'd really get that demon off of you now
[58:24] and then I preach a lot better
[58:26] and you can listen a lot better
[58:32] unconfessed sin because the church to
[58:35] fail
[58:37] help me God
[58:40] help me God
[58:43] I know we're human
[58:45] I know we make mistakes
[58:47] I know we have things in our mind that
[58:49] running through right now like wanting
[58:51] me to shut up
[58:53] and and shoot shoot that man
[58:56] hey brother I'll tell you he's honest he
[58:58] go to work with brother brother we plant
[59:00] tapes and this before Daddy got in the
[59:02] message he'd be playing tapes and the
[59:03] devil said just reach and grab that
[59:05] steering wheel and push push him off the
[59:07] road kill him just kill that guy get him
[59:11] but thank God he did
[59:13] he did see what he overcame that demon
[59:16] that was trying to tell him that
[59:18] so you would have to do the same thing
[59:19] how do you overcome
[59:22] resist the death
[59:24] and he will flee from you not just move
[59:28] over but flee
[59:31] listen if he can tip tempt Jesus himself
[59:34] he's so gonna attempt you
[59:37] but how did Jesus he didn't come and do
[59:39] some magic he didn't do some miraculous
[59:42] healing to prove to the devil he said
[59:44] devil it is written
[59:46] this
[59:47] devil it is written
[59:50] devil or Satan it is written it's all he
[59:54] said that's all then when the Bible says
[59:56] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[59:57] that's what the Bible says you know what
[1:00:00] we do when body men to sit down and have
[1:00:02] coffee
[1:00:05] tea meal
[1:00:10] I'm talking about all of us today
[1:00:12] if we're going to be a honed group to
[1:00:14] get up into this statue of perfect man
[1:00:16] we've got to start living walking
[1:00:20] different
[1:00:21] of us
[1:00:26] why has God give us
[1:00:29] 60 years
[1:00:30] since a prophet left
[1:00:32] 60 years
[1:00:34] for us to get this message right because
[1:00:36] remember he didn't come preach no other
[1:00:38] no more sermons he got all the sermons
[1:00:40] done so in 1965 in December
[1:00:43] then he passed on he has no more sermons
[1:00:45] to deliver to us he and I'll promise you
[1:00:47] one things for sure if you think he's
[1:00:49] coming back then you are a lazy bum
[1:00:54] because that's what it makes you well
[1:00:56] we're waiting on brother round to come
[1:00:58] back you know why because you can sit
[1:00:59] down and sit in your couch with your
[1:01:00] legs folded
[1:01:03] and listen to tapes
[1:01:06] that's not what the Bible said
[1:01:10] I'm worried about more Jesus coming than
[1:01:13] I am brother Brown coming I better get
[1:01:16] Jesus in here so I can see him when he
[1:01:18] comes what are the prophets coming back
[1:01:20] we know but he's not going to come back
[1:01:22] on his own
[1:01:26] he's bringing all those with him but
[1:01:28] it's going to be because somebody
[1:01:31] some group of people
[1:01:33] took their self and said God use me
[1:01:37] I don't want to see brother Gary Atkins
[1:01:39] I want to see brother Ray all the
[1:01:40] different ones brother Richmond
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:46] I want to see him in their youth
[1:01:49] I want to see him come get screaming
[1:01:52] through the door and not even have to
[1:01:53] open it
[1:01:55] and you can hug them
[1:01:57] what a mystery
[1:01:59] that's what we're looking at that's what
[1:02:00] the word is going to do it'll change you
[1:02:04] it will not cause you to get worse if
[1:02:06] you get worse you get worse for your own
[1:02:07] accord the word of God as brotherdale's
[1:02:11] always said
[1:02:12] those of you don't pay your tithes
[1:02:14] pay your tires for one year
[1:02:17] every service
[1:02:19] or not every service but pay your time
[1:02:20] you know how to do that pay your tires
[1:02:21] pay often if you're not better in a year
[1:02:23] he said he'd give you everybody'll be
[1:02:25] back he has never had to give a dime
[1:02:28] back
[1:02:29] if you'll do what God Said
[1:02:31] and I promise you if you'll come to
[1:02:32] church that's why y'all fighting y'all
[1:02:35] fight each other not each other between
[1:02:36] you'd fight your other your other your
[1:02:39] other person
[1:02:40] one of your personalities
[1:02:43] no you fight yourself
[1:02:47] you fight yourself
[1:02:49] you're not fighting God
[1:02:50] you fight yourself go like I said before
[1:02:53] you take all the what brother Brown said
[1:02:55] about coming to church the reason he
[1:02:57] said 20 minutes early or 30 minutes
[1:02:58] early he knows we're human he knows we
[1:03:01] got to get all that cleaned out he knows
[1:03:03] that he looks back in the Old Testament
[1:03:05] and he sees Saul Saul is trouble with
[1:03:08] evil spirits the Bible says come on
[1:03:10] somebody troubled relieval spirits and
[1:03:13] what happens somebody come in and shout
[1:03:14] and scream and lay hands on him no he
[1:03:16] called he said man I feel good when
[1:03:18] David comes and plays that harp
[1:03:27] Spirits left him
[1:03:30] amen that's why we sing to begin a
[1:03:34] service with
[1:03:35] that's why we worship to begin a service
[1:03:37] with not because it's in an order
[1:03:40] is to get all those demons
[1:03:42] at least get a mask up against the wall
[1:03:45] if you can't get them out of here what's
[1:03:47] maximum up against the wall Brothers you
[1:03:49] keep them up there
[1:03:53] but look
[1:03:54] I'm not going to get anywhere but we're
[1:03:56] going to get to this we are made
[1:03:58] Protectors of his Holiness we in his
[1:04:00] damage
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:06] I am now listen listen to this his word
[1:04:09] made flesh again in us oh brother never
[1:04:11] look what is it not the mythical
[1:04:14] imaginary God sitting out there but the
[1:04:17] Living God what is the Living God
[1:04:19] the word in you making yourself real
[1:04:27] listen it's
[1:04:30] scary to see a a a a a a foggy anointing
[1:04:33] or or something come over and you can
[1:04:35] see it but Satan can do the exact same
[1:04:39] thing
[1:04:40] but when you get it right in here when
[1:04:43] that light shines from here out
[1:04:46] Satan can't impersonate that
[1:04:49] he cannot
[1:04:50] oh I know you think I'm
[1:04:52] thinking of my hand but oh brother do
[1:04:53] you see it triumph over every
[1:04:55] denomination
[1:04:57] God made manifest in a living Temple and
[1:04:59] the word of God which is God is made
[1:05:01] flesh where in you
[1:05:04] why you're seated in Heavenly places
[1:05:06] triumphed over all things in Christ
[1:05:08] Jesus
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] Psalms 42 says deep
[1:05:13] calleth unto deep
[1:05:15] at the noise of thy water spouse
[1:05:17] all thy ways and abilities are gone over
[1:05:19] me
[1:05:21] his brother Brown talks about this is
[1:05:23] what he said in the film deep calls to
[1:05:25] the Deep now before when the Deep calls
[1:05:27] to the Deep before they can be a deep
[1:05:28] call
[1:05:30] there has to be a deep to respond to it
[1:05:35] that's why you can't sit still in the
[1:05:38] Church of a living God
[1:05:40] and have a deep call inside
[1:05:42] it's got to come out or you don't have
[1:05:44] it at all
[1:05:48] I'm just reading this listen
[1:05:54] people get happy with coupons now you're
[1:05:56] talking about coupons
[1:05:58] get happy when I get coupons in the mail
[1:06:00] tell me I'm a postal to every person
[1:06:02] they come up to the post office I didn't
[1:06:04] get my coupons today
[1:06:06] well they'll be in your mailbox tomorrow
[1:06:08] I'll get okay I get it I gotta go to
[1:06:11] Kroger I gotta go to this place
[1:06:15] I gotta go Church
[1:06:19] before they can be a deep call there has
[1:06:21] to be a deed to respond listen there's
[1:06:24] something in there called out for more
[1:06:27] of God
[1:06:29] you might have been living in a
[1:06:31] Justified State before God but you
[1:06:33] wanted the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:34] and you hungered for it now the very
[1:06:38] reason that there is a Holy Ghost is
[1:06:39] because you were hungering
[1:06:41] for it you would never hunger for it
[1:06:45] unless there was something in here to
[1:06:47] call for it out of there
[1:06:49] see what I mean
[1:06:54] what would God call the people out of
[1:06:56] this evil age for
[1:06:58] his name
[1:06:59] the reason of it is is to try her
[1:07:02] his bride
[1:07:04] oh and picnic folks you know that
[1:07:07] the reason is to try her his bride when
[1:07:11] she has made manifest been tried been
[1:07:13] proven proved to who Satan like it was
[1:07:17] at the beginning so shall it be at the
[1:07:19] end I wrote myself a note I want God to
[1:07:21] be proud of me I want my Lord to be
[1:07:24] satisfied with me right I want my life
[1:07:27] to be what it has to be
[1:07:31] and when I come to the great eternity I
[1:07:33] want him to say
[1:07:35] come on in
[1:07:36] I'm satisfied with him
[1:07:39] but those of us that want more of God we
[1:07:42] want virtue the strength of God the
[1:07:44] knowledge of God to know right from
[1:07:46] wrong not right from wrong out there
[1:07:47] it's it's nice to know that that you
[1:07:50] know people like brother John are
[1:07:51] teaching these courses but of uh sorry
[1:07:54] but a devil possessed person can can get
[1:07:56] their finances right you know but a
[1:07:59] Christian
[1:08:00] a devil can't get a Christian right
[1:08:03] a devil always make you wrong
[1:08:06] but something inside of us the knowledge
[1:08:08] that we need God and then yes we need to
[1:08:10] work on our finances
[1:08:13] right
[1:08:15] you can call her all you want to it's
[1:08:16] good to have money in your pocket
[1:08:19] I thought I got a lot more a man without
[1:08:21] laughing than the whole sermon
[1:08:23] it's nice to have a little jingle in the
[1:08:26] pocket
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:28] if you get it the right way and you paid
[1:08:31] your tithe then God pours out a blessing
[1:08:33] then praise the Lord
[1:08:36] Temperance self-control
[1:08:40] tempers doesn't mean stop drinking
[1:08:41] alcohol
[1:08:42] no temperature doesn't mean alcoholic
[1:08:44] cure it's Bible Temperance Holy Spirit
[1:08:47] temperance that's just one of the lusts
[1:08:49] of the flesh how to control your temper
[1:08:52] and we all have an issue with that
[1:08:54] okay fly off every time anybody speaks
[1:08:57] crossed to you boy a lot of us is going
[1:09:00] to fall off before we get started aren't
[1:09:01] we remember brother Branham I guarantee
[1:09:03] you when he's sitting here standing here
[1:09:05] preaching this sermon he's remembering
[1:09:08] in his mind that he almost killed
[1:09:12] a group of kids
[1:09:14] because of his temper
[1:09:17] he almost killed a man
[1:09:19] because of his temper
[1:09:22] that went right through his head and
[1:09:24] that listen that went right through
[1:09:25] Peter's head too
[1:09:27] Peter cut a man's ear off
[1:09:30] before he got the Holy Ghost
[1:09:32] so he could say add to your faith virtue
[1:09:34] I like what the brother said not too
[1:09:36] long ago he said Peter was the one that
[1:09:38] could he he lived it
[1:09:40] that's why he could say add to your
[1:09:42] faith but then Paul comes and tells you
[1:09:44] how to do it
[1:09:46] because really just Peter says add your
[1:09:47] faith virtue and all his temper's
[1:09:48] patience and he kind of gives you a
[1:09:49] little commentary but the whole
[1:09:51] everything uh that Paul has to say is
[1:09:53] putting these virtues in line
[1:09:55] so that we'll know how to do it know why
[1:09:59] boy a lot of us are going to fall off
[1:10:00] before we get started then we wonder why
[1:10:02] God is not in his church doing miracles
[1:10:04] and things that they used to do yes sir
[1:10:08] Temperance how to answer in kindness
[1:10:10] when wrath just spoke to you somebody
[1:10:12] say you bunch of Holy Rollers don't jump
[1:10:14] out roll up your sleeves now but talk
[1:10:16] with Godly love Temperance kindness is
[1:10:19] that the way you want to be congregation
[1:10:21] says
[1:10:23] when you're riled up round up back let
[1:10:25] him be your example if you still blow up
[1:10:27] and fuss and stew and carry on you ain't
[1:10:29] got enough Temperance you can't add that
[1:10:31] because it won't add it won't vulcanize
[1:10:34] then we're talking about vulcanization
[1:10:35] the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance
[1:10:37] that he had then it will vulcanize with
[1:10:39] him you're added to it and remember we
[1:10:42] know what vulcanization was
[1:10:45] it is a process that puts something
[1:10:47] together that can't be pulled back apart
[1:10:49] so what he's saying by the way the
[1:10:51] impact of this is this is that you're
[1:10:53] not going God's not going to give you
[1:10:54] Temperance and then take it away from
[1:10:56] you
[1:10:57] you're not going to take take
[1:10:58] temperatures away from me once you get
[1:11:00] it and you get it solidified in there
[1:11:02] he's not going to take it away from you
[1:11:04] it can't be reversed vulcanization white
[1:11:07] brother I'm use that word vulcanization
[1:11:08] he only used it inside your perfect man
[1:11:11] because he knows that when we get right
[1:11:13] here look it's a scripture says in
[1:11:15] Ephesians 4 talks about compacted that's
[1:11:17] what that Holy Spirit does what do we do
[1:11:19] when we build houses and when we build
[1:11:21] things and brother Gary was here to tell
[1:11:23] you that Foundation has got to be good
[1:11:24] so we had a uh we used to a long time
[1:11:27] ago we'd had a tamping rod this whole
[1:11:29] thing or remember ozani and you Tamp
[1:11:31] that thing down and you Tamp it down and
[1:11:33] Tamp it down then you put your concrete
[1:11:36] over it but if you didn't if it was just
[1:11:38] something you just throwed a bunch of
[1:11:39] loose sand out there and then you tried
[1:11:41] to build the foundation well guess
[1:11:42] what's going to happen it's going to
[1:11:43] fall off one side or the other same way
[1:11:45] with us that's why we've listened to
[1:11:46] brother Dale for 40 50 years that's why
[1:11:48] now you're listening to all these
[1:11:49] ministers
[1:11:50] Louise Friday I appreciate the ministers
[1:11:53] we have in this church absolutely
[1:11:56] appreciate them and I'm telling you too
[1:11:59] the Bible talks about exercising your
[1:12:01] gift I told him I said y'all need to get
[1:12:03] out if anybody invites you to preach
[1:12:04] don't say no go
[1:12:07] because you get better the more you
[1:12:09] practice
[1:12:10] the Bible says exercise your gift
[1:12:13] and that's what we want to do we want to
[1:12:15] let them yeah let preach it Wednesday
[1:12:16] nights and preach different time I want
[1:12:18] to exercise her gift I want them to be
[1:12:20] able to bring something to us that we
[1:12:22] can take in it's not just me and brother
[1:12:25] Dale and that's it
[1:12:27] it's a five-fold Ministry that we listen
[1:12:29] to all that we benefit from Brother Jack
[1:12:31] Duff coming in and bringing what he
[1:12:33] brought last weekend and bring in a
[1:12:35] different angle of sanctification I mean
[1:12:37] uh patience
[1:12:41] battles
[1:12:42] well that's what the whole thing is I
[1:12:44] just never said it and I never looked at
[1:12:45] it that way but this is all a battle
[1:12:48] patience is the battle right
[1:12:52] somebody tell me they've whipped
[1:12:54] patience
[1:12:57] we pray for liars
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:02] right so guess what we need patience
[1:13:06] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:13:08] together and compacted that's why we
[1:13:10] come to church that's why we listen to
[1:13:12] the prophet's message that's why we
[1:13:13] that's why we gather together what to
[1:13:16] bring us together
[1:13:18] you know what Satan is he divides and
[1:13:20] conquers listen to this let me give you
[1:13:22] something that'll help you remember
[1:13:24] Satan divides and conquers that's why
[1:13:26] the the pope you know he's always that's
[1:13:27] not Victory he's dividing and conquering
[1:13:29] everywhere he's going he's separating
[1:13:30] you from God now listen when Satan
[1:13:32] separates you from God I promise you
[1:13:34] he's got somebody that he's going to
[1:13:36] hook you up with
[1:13:39] he's just not going to separate you and
[1:13:40] let you just go out into the woods no
[1:13:43] he's got somebody in mind when he was
[1:13:46] there in Nicea Satan knew if he got the
[1:13:49] church away from the true believers
[1:13:53] he could have a pope
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] he can have a denomination so he was
[1:13:59] divine and conquering but remember he's
[1:14:02] got his own plan he's got his own agenda
[1:14:05] if he separates you from the church he's
[1:14:07] got something where he's going to send
[1:14:08] you to and it ain't good
[1:14:11] think about that
[1:14:12] yeah he's a divider but guess what he
[1:14:15] he's got something else he's got in mind
[1:14:17] that he's going to bring you in his way
[1:14:19] what do you do with Adam and Eve he
[1:14:21] didn't just separate them
[1:14:23] he knew what he would do if he could get
[1:14:25] him separated he knew what he could do
[1:14:27] with Eve
[1:14:28] everybody with me so let's compact it by
[1:14:31] that whichever joint Supply according to
[1:14:33] the factual working as a measure of
[1:14:34] every part make its increase of the body
[1:14:36] into the edifying itself in love in
[1:14:38] other words that word means knit
[1:14:40] together to cause a person to unite with
[1:14:42] one in a conclusion or come to the same
[1:14:44] opinion prove demonstrate teaching
[1:14:47] struck
[1:14:48] that's what we need is the compacting of
[1:14:51] this message of the hour instead of
[1:14:53] having all these different doctrines
[1:14:55] Bob and I were talking
[1:14:58] um Friday and and uh
[1:15:01] brother Whidbey made a comment years ago
[1:15:03] this before he passed away we were at a
[1:15:05] um Minister's breakfast up in Ruth and
[1:15:07] there was probably 100 preachers in the
[1:15:09] in the building and probably whippy
[1:15:12] looked around he said
[1:15:13] how many different doctrines you think's
[1:15:15] in this room right now
[1:15:17] supposed to be just one
[1:15:19] the message
[1:15:22] but Satan what
[1:15:25] dividing and conquering he's trying in
[1:15:28] the message to divide and conquerors
[1:15:29] close he's wanting to send you to
[1:15:30] another person he's wanting to send you
[1:15:32] to a tape Ministry he's wanting to send
[1:15:33] you to Jeffersonville I'm sorry folks
[1:15:35] he's wanting to send you to somewhere
[1:15:37] that's off the word of God
[1:15:39] all right let's have patience just for a
[1:15:42] second we'll close right here
[1:15:45] Old Testament
[1:15:47] because to have real God
[1:15:50] depending birth
[1:15:51] because we read many there's more
[1:15:53] scripture about patience and it's in the
[1:15:55] Old Testament but now there's many
[1:15:57] scriptures that talks about being
[1:15:59] patient but it doesn't say that word it
[1:16:01] talks about long-suffering and talks
[1:16:03] about all these different things so
[1:16:05] let's read them here in the New
[1:16:06] Testament it's the characteristic of a
[1:16:08] man who has not swerved from his
[1:16:10] deliberate purpose
[1:16:12] and his loyalty to Faith and party
[1:16:16] so you can't just say well I'm just
[1:16:18] patient
[1:16:19] no there's something you got to be
[1:16:21] patient with
[1:16:24] and what wrote around tell us to be
[1:16:25] patient with God
[1:16:28] listen to this just for a second and
[1:16:29] we'll close
[1:16:30] Hebrews 6 verse 10 said for God is Not
[1:16:33] unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:16:34] labor of love which you have showed
[1:16:36] toward his name and that you have
[1:16:38] ministered to the Saints and do Minister
[1:16:39] and we desire that every one of you do
[1:16:42] show the same diligence to the full
[1:16:43] Assurance of Hope until the end that you
[1:16:45] be not slothful but followers of them
[1:16:48] who through look through faith and
[1:16:50] patience inherit the promise
[1:16:55] for when God made promise to Abraham
[1:16:57] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:16:59] lifted his hand and he said Adam
[1:17:02] let's go back Adam I'm gonna do it
[1:17:06] Abraham I'm gonna do it
[1:17:10] Jesus come to the earth I am the I am I
[1:17:15] am the one that's going to do it you
[1:17:17] just need to plug yourself into me for
[1:17:19] when God made promise to Abraham because
[1:17:21] he couldn't wear nobody else he swear by
[1:17:24] himself
[1:17:25] James 1 verse two my brother encountered
[1:17:27] all joy when you fall into many
[1:17:29] Temptations what
[1:17:34] Joy
[1:17:37] when you fall into one Temptation no
[1:17:40] that word diverse means many
[1:17:42] Temptations
[1:17:45] there's not a person in here that's not
[1:17:47] going through some kind of Temptation
[1:17:52] knowing this all right James is he's
[1:17:55] giving us the mind of God knowing this
[1:17:59] that the trying of your faith worketh
[1:18:01] patience
[1:18:03] but let patience have her
[1:18:07] isn't she
[1:18:09] whoops
[1:18:11] it's a bride
[1:18:13] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:18:16] that ye may be perfect an entire warning
[1:18:20] nothing
[1:18:24] well John you paid way too much for that
[1:18:26] house
[1:18:28] but with your but with your patience
[1:18:31] in your patience possess you your wallet
[1:18:34] in your back pocket
[1:18:40] that feels good doesn't it amen feels
[1:18:43] good
[1:18:44] I think when we first took the Dave
[1:18:45] Ramsey course that was back in my
[1:18:47] goodness to the 2000s we had 6 500 in in
[1:18:51] um credit card debt which is not much
[1:18:53] compared to the average now everybody's
[1:18:56] got it's like twenty thousand dollars
[1:18:58] but we paid that off in about two months
[1:19:00] we just found things it was just things
[1:19:03] laying everywhere we sold stuff all
[1:19:05] right
[1:19:06] he said sell so much stuff that you kids
[1:19:08] get nervous
[1:19:17] you wake up with a price tag on your
[1:19:19] thumb
[1:19:24] you get twice as much for me
[1:19:28] but that's the same way with the gospel
[1:19:31] that was things John did
[1:19:33] that was things Alicia give up
[1:19:37] to have what they have
[1:19:41] so why saying why don't we and we know
[1:19:43] that we that's okay like I said it's
[1:19:45] okay to have money it's okay to build
[1:19:46] certain things here you gotta have money
[1:19:48] to survive and it does make you feel
[1:19:49] good when you got a little bit left over
[1:19:51] and you paycheck
[1:19:52] but if you put everything on that
[1:19:56] you become a rich young ruler
[1:19:59] where you believe the message you don't
[1:20:00] cut your hair you don't smoke you don't
[1:20:02] drink everybody with me
[1:20:05] sell it all at all and follow me
[1:20:10] he couldn't do it
[1:20:11] and where do you lift up his eyes
[1:20:14] in hell
[1:20:16] he had missed it because of his riches
[1:20:18] he had missed it because of his job
[1:20:21] he'd missed it because he built a bunch
[1:20:23] of Barns and he needed to get more stuff
[1:20:25] in it
[1:20:27] we don't have stuff do we
[1:20:29] okay bless your heart
[1:20:32] that's why they're building these that's
[1:20:34] why they're building these storage units
[1:20:37] like hundreds at a time Maysville George
[1:20:40] Georgia's got 150
[1:20:41] pictures they ain't that many people in
[1:20:42] the whole town
[1:20:45] but you know what they'll fill them up
[1:20:46] why because stuff
[1:20:48] let's get rid of my stuff
[1:20:52] the weight of sand is so easy besides us
[1:20:55] and let us run
[1:20:57] with patience even by the walk with God
[1:20:59] but today brother George we gotta run
[1:21:04] and that's what we're supposed to do
[1:21:06] reflect the Son of God now we're
[1:21:08] supposed to do his work he said he that
[1:21:10] believeth on me John 14 7 he didn't
[1:21:12] believe it's gonna be the worst that I
[1:21:13] do shall he do also you're beginning to
[1:21:16] reflect the works of Christ but so many
[1:21:20] of us try to do the works of Christ
[1:21:22] before the reflection of Christ is in US
[1:21:28] now there's the trouble
[1:21:30] we find those things happening you know
[1:21:33] I know it I read the scripture along
[1:21:36] both Dale preached on this long time ago
[1:21:39] about
[1:21:40] your brother Ram said running preach
[1:21:41] running without a message or running
[1:21:43] ahead of God's program God's got a
[1:21:44] program and a plan and we got to be
[1:21:46] right there with it we can't run ahead
[1:21:47] of it that's what he's saying right here
[1:21:49] look you know I know it we see these
[1:21:51] stumbles along the road
[1:21:53] we find the scrap heap of ministers
[1:21:57] Christians now he ain't talking about
[1:21:59] unbelievers
[1:22:01] he talked about Sinners prostitutes he's
[1:22:04] talking about us
[1:22:06] ministers Christians piled along the
[1:22:09] road is because they didn't go into it
[1:22:12] right
[1:22:13] because we trying to go ahead of God's
[1:22:15] program
[1:22:17] that's why I'm
[1:22:19] here is to try to teach them
[1:22:21] teach the church and my
[1:22:24] and my The Dwelling Place of the Living
[1:22:26] God how many like that congregation says
[1:22:28] amen second Peter 3 9 the Lord is not
[1:22:31] slack concerning his promises as some
[1:22:34] men count slightness but it's what
[1:22:35] long-suffering
[1:22:38] to us we're not willing that any should
[1:22:40] perish as brother Brown was telling us
[1:22:42] but that all should come to repentance
[1:22:44] James 5 verse 7 says be patient
[1:22:46] musicians come on be patient therefore
[1:22:48] Brethren to the coming of the Lord
[1:22:50] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[1:22:53] precious fruit of the Earth
[1:22:55] and half long patience for it
[1:22:59] folks if you ever realize this
[1:23:02] we talk about Genesis 1 and we talk
[1:23:04] about going back into eternity and
[1:23:05] there's only God himself right
[1:23:08] but he had attribution he wanted to have
[1:23:10] these things he wanted to have all these
[1:23:11] children he wanted to have these people
[1:23:13] that were a walking living breathing
[1:23:16] instrumentality of God Amen
[1:23:18] but remember for him to be and have a
[1:23:21] plan and purpose he would he will save
[1:23:22] you a Healer a redeemer and all these
[1:23:24] different things he had to not make man
[1:23:26] get lost he had to allow us to make a
[1:23:29] choice
[1:23:30] and in our choice we got lost so he
[1:23:33] could become a savior he could become a
[1:23:34] redeemer he could become a Healer not be
[1:23:36] coming he always was it but you and I
[1:23:38] are the recipients of that
[1:23:41] so the husbandman Christ waited for the
[1:23:44] precious fruit of the earth us
[1:23:46] and hath long patience for it remember
[1:23:50] he had to drop down
[1:23:52] into time
[1:23:54] for me and you
[1:23:57] and right now we're separated from God
[1:23:59] we can't see God face to face
[1:24:02] hey man we can't see Jesus face to face
[1:24:07] we see him through the attributes we see
[1:24:09] him through pillow fire we see him
[1:24:10] through all these but we don't see the
[1:24:12] body of Jesus and we won't see him until
[1:24:16] we go to the marriage supper that's how
[1:24:19] much sin has pulled us apart from God
[1:24:21] but he made a way for us to get back in
[1:24:24] the spiritual realm and in that
[1:24:26] spiritual realm come on people that
[1:24:28] spiritual realm one day is going to take
[1:24:29] over this guy
[1:24:31] and it's gonna be God
[1:24:34] let's stand her feet
[1:24:42] come on Brian amen get in the plan
[1:24:46] come on
[1:24:48] but he's got so much patience
[1:24:50] until he received the former or early in
[1:24:53] the letter Reign be ye also patient
[1:24:56] establish your hearts for the coming of
[1:24:58] the Lord
[1:24:58] drawth now that was written 2 000 years
[1:25:01] ago
[1:25:03] then fourthly we want to add patience to
[1:25:05] your faith
[1:25:06] if you got faith the Bible says it
[1:25:08] worketh patience
[1:25:10] let's go on down brother Brown says we
[1:25:11] have Glory we have shouts and things
[1:25:13] because we got faith
[1:25:15] but when we come down to these things
[1:25:17] here
[1:25:19] God can't build us into that stature see
[1:25:21] he can't he can't make us up to that
[1:25:24] kind of a place we got all these other
[1:25:26] things we fall slide off he can't build
[1:25:28] his church
[1:25:31] I read you this a long time when we
[1:25:32] first got started
[1:25:35] there's many examples even Paul looks at
[1:25:39] I believe it was the Galatians or
[1:25:41] somewhere somebody you all know who the
[1:25:43] scripture is where he looks and he said
[1:25:44] though I have all faith
[1:25:47] to move mountains
[1:25:49] right and the way he said though I have
[1:25:51] all Faith to move move them out have you
[1:25:53] ever done that before
[1:25:55] he said though I have all faith and
[1:25:57] though I know all the Mysteries
[1:26:01] but I have not charity
[1:26:03] I have not that love
[1:26:06] that he's talking about right there
[1:26:08] I'm a sounding brass
[1:26:11] a tinkling symbol just making noise
[1:26:13] so brother Brown Tate picks it up and he
[1:26:15] says right here in the Statue of perfect
[1:26:17] man paragraph 146 he says faith alone
[1:26:19] won't do it
[1:26:23] I bet you the theologians were having a
[1:26:25] fit because he was talking about faith
[1:26:26] he's talking about faith faith
[1:26:27] Foundation Faith this faith that and
[1:26:29] then he stops he says faith alone won't
[1:26:32] do it
[1:26:34] then Abraham we find out didn't obey God
[1:26:36] just right now he made ready and had
[1:26:39] faith in the promise
[1:26:41] but see we can still have faith in the
[1:26:43] promise and then not obey
[1:26:46] still
[1:26:48] it'll hinder us
[1:26:50] that's where we want to get to still
[1:26:52] have faith in the promise
[1:26:54] and then not obey what do we read the
[1:26:57] scripture where where Samuel
[1:27:00] tell Saul kill them all get rid of the
[1:27:03] kings make sure that country does not
[1:27:07] ever rise up again even kill the goats
[1:27:09] and the animals and kill the kids I want
[1:27:11] them all destroyed that's what God Said
[1:27:13] through Samuel and then Saul takes it
[1:27:16] upon himself to save a few
[1:27:19] Sammy walks up he said
[1:27:21] do I hear some sheep blating out in your
[1:27:23] backyard
[1:27:24] and I hear two kings hollering and
[1:27:26] screaming in the jail though he had him
[1:27:28] in jail
[1:27:30] what do you tell them
[1:27:32] he said to obey
[1:27:34] is better than sacrifice because I'm
[1:27:36] sure Saul said well hey we're gonna
[1:27:37] bring them here we're gonna make
[1:27:39] we got all these
[1:27:42] all kind of uh sacrifices to God now
[1:27:45] with all these you know what Samuel done
[1:27:46] he took his sword
[1:27:51] y'all think we mean sometimes
[1:27:53] Samuel took his sword and he said bring
[1:27:55] him two kings out here
[1:27:57] he can just stab him
[1:27:59] cut their heads off
[1:28:01] right and you know what he'd done he had
[1:28:02] I believe he took that sword in the
[1:28:04] ground and he told Saul he said you have
[1:28:07] been rented from the house of God
[1:28:08] because you didn't obey because to obey
[1:28:11] what I said was greater than the
[1:28:12] sacrifice of you bringing all these
[1:28:15] people in here and bringing all this
[1:28:16] stuff and listen let me tell you and
[1:28:17] putting up with the demons we put up
[1:28:19] with
[1:28:20] all right hmm
[1:28:23] well that got all that was didn't it
[1:28:25] just faith alone won't work because
[1:28:26] faith without works is dead
[1:28:30] if you've got faith folks if we've got
[1:28:31] real true faith
[1:28:33] it will produce itself
[1:28:36] and people will be able to see it
[1:28:41] just like the borderline Believers let
[1:28:42] me get this and then we'll finish
[1:28:44] got people today you find in the Bible
[1:28:46] it said for it is impossible for those
[1:28:48] which are once enlightened and made
[1:28:50] partakers of the Holy Ghost wow pretty
[1:28:52] good believer message believer our
[1:28:54] message person and fall away to renew
[1:28:56] themselves again unto repentance seeing
[1:28:58] they crucify to themselves the Son of
[1:29:00] God afresh encounter below the Covenant
[1:29:03] wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy
[1:29:05] thing I don't have to do that
[1:29:08] that's just old preacher telling me
[1:29:10] something
[1:29:11] and done despite to the works of Grace
[1:29:13] now in Hebrews 10 It also says it's a
[1:29:15] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[1:29:17] the Living God and those people you've
[1:29:19] seen them come to church they'll come
[1:29:21] and they'll say oh yes I believe yes sir
[1:29:23] I but they'll they believe it but
[1:29:26] they'll never look lay their hands to it
[1:29:30] to turn one will to help it go on
[1:29:34] I'm just reading what prophet says
[1:29:38] don't be mad at me if you like brothers
[1:29:39] don't be mad cause I found this quote
[1:29:42] they believe it but they'll never lay
[1:29:44] their hands what they'll never want to
[1:29:46] go up that statue of perfect man they'll
[1:29:48] hinder they'll hinder Services they'll
[1:29:51] hinder off I'm just telling you what he
[1:29:52] says to turn one wheel to help it go on
[1:29:55] see now that's just like it was in the
[1:29:57] Bible like Caleb and Joshua come back
[1:29:59] with the evidence that they've been over
[1:30:00] in the promised land but those other
[1:30:02] believers well they weren't believers
[1:30:04] they were unbelievers oh it's too great
[1:30:06] we can't do it but they hung all along
[1:30:08] just the same remember Joshua and Caleb
[1:30:10] said we can take it
[1:30:12] the other 10 said like I preached one
[1:30:14] time ten line preachers they lied
[1:30:17] they lied
[1:30:19] but they you know what happened them 10
[1:30:21] lying preachers they just kept right on
[1:30:23] going kept them all you know what they
[1:30:24] kept them all in the wilderness and then
[1:30:27] one day they all died except Joshua and
[1:30:30] Caleb
[1:30:31] because they did what God said they had
[1:30:33] that burning in their heart they had
[1:30:34] patience to wait 40 more years knowing
[1:30:39] that that promised land was only about
[1:30:40] 10 miles across the desert and they
[1:30:44] walked brother Dales walked with us 50
[1:30:47] some years
[1:30:49] through all of our crying through all of
[1:30:51] our this and that and the other and all
[1:30:52] of our fussing and fighting
[1:30:55] Joshua
[1:30:58] takes him promptly
[1:31:00] Tyson promptly
[1:31:02] they never got to enter the promised
[1:31:04] land just those who came back with faith
[1:31:08] that we could
[1:31:11] now what if that group would have looked
[1:31:13] they said all the amorites grasshoppers
[1:31:16] well but you see Caleb and Joshua still
[1:31:18] to people because they wasn't looking at
[1:31:20] the amorites how big they were how big
[1:31:22] the cities were how big your sin is
[1:31:24] I give you
[1:31:26] the lambers now God give you your
[1:31:27] healing it's one of your assures well
[1:31:30] now God just didn't go over there and
[1:31:31] take a broom and sweep out the
[1:31:32] Canaanites
[1:31:35] and all the amorites and the hitters and
[1:31:37] all them and sweep them out say come on
[1:31:39] Ezra this is yours they've been planting
[1:31:42] crops for you no sir they had to fight
[1:31:44] for every inch of the way
[1:31:47] that's right but they had the promise of
[1:31:49] Victory God told Joshua wherever the
[1:31:51] soul of your foot dreads I'll give it to
[1:31:53] you so Footprints means possession
[1:31:55] remember that sister in a wheelchair
[1:31:57] remember that today any of you that
[1:31:59] needs healing Footprints means
[1:32:01] possession every time the sole of your
[1:32:02] feet touches that's it take that much
[1:32:05] ground
[1:32:07] take that much ground away from the
[1:32:09] Devil
