I'll project myself in a group of people to where you're gonna see me through them because remember si means to understand but if we don't see him will not understand him amen show me the odds of our understanding being lightened today and good to be in the house of Lord good to be back in the saddle I guess you might say it's good to have brothers come in that's fivefold ministry Park but it's good to sit down and just have a little fellowship with their home folks here so good to be here good to have our friend with us there from from Alabama and bless her heart she's got to go back to Alabama anyway people get converted and they come to Georgia so that's okay yes there's a there's no you tell brother Jonathan I said that but good to have them with us today you got your Bibles let's start back with revelation 6 verse 1 and brother Danny's not here to bring my board out so I'll get it in a minute so remember all the announcements brother Chris will be here this week this Wednesday night looking forward to next Sunday as Easter so make sure you bring your Easter crowd with you because a lot of our crowds gonna be gone ok anyway just remember saying remember the ones that are traveling really they're going to the youth camp which is fine it's ok no problem that but they go into the youth camp in Louisiana so it's the long journey been there before I've been there done got the t-shirt so don't didn't go back either but it's good to get the kids out let them let them have a little fun we were all kids at one time I wish we'd have had them a little bit more when I was growing up but remember Easter Sunday though next Sunday we'll we'll be right here fighting the good fight of faith remember also please remember Jim's dad he has pancreatic and if you don't know what that is your pant he has been sick for a week the man is 83 years old he's been sick for a week and he's not sick he's good shape for 83 years old but your pancreas produces the enzymes to break down your food well he's been throwing up and diarrhea for a week and that's not good for a young strong man much less an older gentleman so keep him in your prayers he's back in the hospital but you know what the Lord knows all things and he'll work it to his good always they mint so remember all these other member Jim - she's watching in she stayed up till 5 o'clock this morning with the bronchitis and she's she's just completely exhausted so just remember her just keep us on your prayers devil would love to just kill us all he would love it that's why the angel of the lords and Captain bound us like brother Ernie was saying there's angels here right here with you when you get up in the morning while you're sleeping there's an angel watching over you you you're the heirs of righteousness right then there's an angel giving charge to watch over you amen and we know what we know the end of the story Wars already won we've got a few battles we got to have before we get out of here so that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get out of here so revelation 6 verse 1 and let's go to the Lord in prayer before we go to Heavenly Father we pray Lord today that you will truly as we always say and not not just as we say it for a repetition you'd be the active participant in this service you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the hearing you're the only one that can give revelation and that's what we feed on father just like we feed on natural food we as the bride of Jesus Christ in this endtime we love eagle food we love Revelation father so give today Lord and bountiful amounts to each and every one we bind all the sickness by your word that's come among this people that you'll move it out father take care of each one of us Lord may we see something from you today and know that you're still king of kings and Lord of lords and that you have decided by your own plan to come down here and dwell not just with us but in us and you've told us in your word that whatever we ask in your name that'll be given to us so in the name of Jesus Christ I prayed that you would just bind all the sickness in this service and even the ones that are at home because distance means nothing to you father bless the little bride around the world Lord give the wonderful wonderful ones that overseas and the ones that are doing work Lord just give a fruit for the labor father just bless each one take care of us now as we read your word sanctifies for this journey father in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him out of bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer he may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word shake somebody's hands thank god bless you while I'm doing this man it's cold in there they ain't nothing like a cold preacher that's bad that room and there's cold somebody who put that in there get cramps do you put that in there okay whoever no sir I like him no sir whoever did needs to figure out how the heat works cold and later that's why I have water and it's warm up here dry cold preachers are not good I'll tell y'all shaking hands say god bless you okay do it again god bless double blessing anyway that what we're talking today we're if you pull that back out one more time we're gonna look today I'm going to go background a little bit forgive me I got a little build a call for myself but we're going to background and we're going to talk just a few moments about the Thunder but we got to do a little background first now you see what's on the board on the board is the seven church ages one - this is for this is for Nikki only one two three four five hello one two three four five six seven seven Church ages alright but we're talking about the seals and the seals we put them you can't work them one per each Church age because remember in the fourth seal the rapture takes place hey man I'm telling you what the Prophet said we got there yet but the rapture takes place on the fourth seal will the force that we know the rapture didn't take place in the fourth church age the rapture took plate takes place in this age amantha 7 at the end of the SEM of church aid you and I are to receive a message amen and we've received that message and we're getting ready to go in the rapture which the rapture does take place on the fourth seal which shows that then we can look and see that the lion ox man and eagle which are characteristics of the Holy Ghost amen the prophet of God said the lion age was basically the first three ages the OPP's age was that fourth age why because remember to just say you were a Christian that killed you ox is a beast of burden ox is a labor they labored in that church agent and all they didn't have the power of the gifts and the power sure they had things working in their life amen but they were slaughtered by the millions for just what they believed and then look at me and you we got it so easy but they could just if they were meeting in a room and they were caught they were all killed they didn't have to they didn't go through a judge jury and whatever they were just taking straight to Rome thrown in with the lines and you were done so that aunts age was a labor then the man age come up into what Lutheran Wesley which we brought printing presses and all the things the intelligence of man come in those two ages to bring us what the written Bible and all those things together but also we got to remember in this eighth in this these two ages the denominations rose up man's idea apart from God come up in those two ages amen there wasn't a denomination in any of these ages over here sure Catholicism rose up and came through but there was not a litter to have the Lutheran doctrine there wasn't a Wesley to have the west wing or the Methodists or Pentecost they had to come in to these church ages and these church ages are important because it lines everything up and we'll look at the end of the service and then this last stage was is the Eagle age or the Eagle anointing and just like we were saying last Sunday watch a line that's very strong now this is just for Nicky because everybody's here listening the lion is very strong but when he becomes that when he comes into this world as a baby the line has to drink milk and man the Ox when it comes into the world it drinks milk yet it yet man nothing to pull a house down if it really needed to it would have some strength to it and it had a labor to it it was a laborious animal and then man guess what when man's born I'm talking to you when man is born when man is born guess what we can eat meat but not when we're baby hey man we have to start out drinking milk but now in the Eagle Age the Eagle never drinks milk hello even as a baby momma Eagle choose the big chunks of food up kills the animal that's what preachers do kills the animal breaks down the food puts it in the little eagle's mouth and then when the Eagle matures guess what he can do the same thing he can chew up the pieces and then take it in and swallow it and then give it to the other little baby Eagles hey man so we as this churches grow and grace and knowledge and I was telling somebody the other day you know thank God for teaching because you can take what brother Dale said this morning and you to someone that is a novice that's very very very very very confusing thank God for teaching I don't know how in the world you can get it without listening you can't get you know brother Branham that's fine to listen to tapes but say somebody got to teach you there's somebody got to eat the strong meat break it down and like I said before I wish we could shove it down people through but you can it may choke them but that Eagle never had milk so he's we're in the age of strong meat we're in the age of where we can fly and see as far east west north and south amen the man can only go so high but his intelligence takes him higher but it will not take him higher than an eagle because if a man goes any higher he's got to get in the machine come on people he's got to get sure the intelligence puts us in a in an airplane and shoots us up 32,000 feet but an eagle doesn't need a machine he can get up there pretty high without a machine in his natural natural in our understanding the eagle can fly higher than anything a man not what man has produced but what God has given the anointing of an eagle to you and I so that's what you and I must look at in these seals we see the first seal we show that this is for sister Nicci for the first three ages the second seal would be for lap overs of the third fourth fifth days and then the third seal would be lap over in the fifth and sixth and then the sixth and seventh everybody got that same an alright first seal which is the wild horse rider red horse rider black horse rider and pale horse rider and then and we're getting ready and I want you to watch this today we're getting ready to move in next Sunday into the second seal which which it evolves from a white horse remember Satan rides a white horse because he's deceptive he's riding something so close and we're gonna see it in Revelations and I remember the bible's time I tell the day I've never really seen that before how many times you read the scripture and think man that wasn't there when I read it last time okay same thing with the message you reading imagine you go I brother Brown didn't say that yeah he did read it again so you say what he did but what we're doing we're seeing with what with more understanding alright so we see the understanding of these first three ages was the Ephesian age and we'll see something real real striking because the ephesian church and the Laodicean church are that Alpha and Omega bride name am the Alpha and Omega bride so so there has to be a mirror image or the two bookends has to come together and then we have to get back to the faith of the fathers which was in these ages here there was no denomination here they all started over here all right and remember like we read last Sunday about whether the Father Son Holy Ghost doctrine came from it came from the pits of hell so I wasn't a god thing alright and I was telling bro Louise we'll we'll look at it truly will read what brother Branham said he said the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years not by the Christian but by Creed's and denominations but it's to be loosed in the end time we'll read that a man so the Holy Ghost can be bound it can be grieved it can be bound and it can be grieved that meant you and I are still free moral agents though we are Christians we're still free moral agents hey man so now let's look and see you we talked about when you talk about the seal and I'll tell us at the end when we talk about the Thunder but remember go to the next slide we got to remember the sales is Redemption Redemption Redemption Redemption hey man only the redeemed can even understand what we're talking about amen hey man that's all that's going to be there look this is the redeemed of the earth and then that was 120 in the upper room they were redeemable therefore they were redeemed a man you and I I was telling you the other day you know hey I want to say this just to clear something up you know we talked about we always was eternal and that's true but we come to it we have to come to understanding first that you're lost because you can't be redeemed unless you're lost there's nobody going to be sitting at the wedding supper I never was come on people believe I told brother Louis you ever thought about this you know brother Brennan said bride can't persecute bride right Holy Ghost cannot condemn or persecute the Holy Ghost what Paul do if Paul was always was eternal think about it if Paul was this always was eternal person I thought he said he caused those people to blasting which were the eternal which were the Christians of the day why did Paul we'll talk about lightning the turnitin minute why did Paul just not come down as the light and smack Paul and say Paul you always was eternal no he said Paul you're gonna be blind for three days because you don't know what you've been doing maybe you're starting to understand but he took the Holy Ghost filled preacher named Anna nice to meet with Paul and lay his hands only to receive the Holy Ghost you and I need Redemption you and I need the Holy Ghost to quicken the word look at Paul Paul knew the word why did he have to take the Old Testament go back into the desert after he saves the Holy Ghost if he always was now look in the mind of God I never was lost but just like I'm telling you like what brother Dale's telling you there's layers to this there's layers to this message let me give you a thought of a beekeeper I used to not be now we got people that we that when we go to our beekeeper meetings they only want to have to be half that's all they want okay I'm making a point here gobble beekeeping listen they only want to be how last one little old lady one day I said how's your hives she said they're fine I said have you been inside the box - look she says no I just sit down in front of me watch the bees go in and out and in and out and in and out and they're fine no they're not she's a bee have her she's not a beekeeper but that's all she's satisfied with it you can call her a beekeeper she's satisfied with two little white hives sitting in her backyard in the backyard okay that's somebody like me I have 35 to 50 hives getting ready to have about 75 because you know what now I understand I hope y'all understand what I'm saying now I understand more about beekeeping so it's the same two hives bees do two things they pollinate and they reproduce that's it that's the basics of Christianity okay that's the basics of Christianity but I want more so I've got 50 hives now because I've took the two I had and I've what red I go to be meetings on Sunday and Wednesday [Applause] and I want to know more about this beekeeping thing but you know what my fifty hives has nothing compared to this guy Norg and it's got 15,000 beehive same two boxes same principle reproduce and make honey that's all they do he's just got in a bigger scale same way with the same way with you and I we start here with two boxes we're born again we're Christians but you can say that's enough hey man you can say that's enough for me I just like to watch them going in and out I just like to come and sit down and listen to a good sermon but there's others that want more they want more boxes of the same thing of the same thing same principle you don't lose your principle but pulse is leaving the principle of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection amen so the breaking of these seals is my 15,000 hives compared to the two hives when I was a born again child a baby in Christ watching the bees go in and out going to church and reading my Bible studying hey man but we want more others want more I want to learn about rate I raise my own Queens now so I can do that and I can sell them you see what I'm saying same way with Christianity you get out of it what you put into it amen now obviously I don't want 15,000 house but I do want 15,000 hives in the gospel hey man I want but it's still the same two boxes it still bees going in and out getting pollen and reproducing that's all you do same way with what brother Graham said go on with a same simple message but build on it amen so what gave you the new burns what brought you into the beekeeping community it's your desire to want more and to know more amen but it's the same two boxes it's the same justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same plan of redemption they save these people these people these people these people these people the only problem these people right here we have a problem well you can call it a problem there's no more Church ages we can't make no more B boxes we can't give it off to somebody else this is it coca-cola sister Nicci is not in Alabama Crimson Tide is definitely not it but God is it that's what we're looking for and if we don't then we're going to be like that old ladies sitting there watching them two beehives and one day she's gonna fall over dead but let's go on to perfection let's take this layer at a time layer at a time like Louise said this morning learn more about God if I want to be a good beekeeper guess what I'll stay up a couple hours and watch some bee videos why cuz I want to be better amen that Saint there is a Christian you want to be better listen hey listen I might play anytime I want to I don't have to tell me somebody I got a I got a match play on Sunday that hurt but to break into these seals is not necessarily for the soul because that woman sent in watching us to be how she's just as happy as the guy with 15,000 five because you know what she loves what she's doing she loves the Lord she loves gone and her soul is redeemed by the new birth the shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary that's the basics of everything amen but the opening of the word or the firmament of the word the seals will bring now full fellowship back into manifestation because look God's not satisfied the way it is and he's already laid it out there in 66 months we've got a 66 book instruction manual but God didn't stop there he sent a prophet added 1100 he added 1100 sermons in between them 66 books to give us the love letter to explain more clearly not what God didn't say but what God's already said hey man that's what these seals are for amen thereby alright say man we want full fellowship my desire is more fellowship with God and the only way to fit you can't fellowship with God and be keeping nothing I was just using that for an example but you can't he said you read my word brother and said how you get closer to God standing on your head drink more coca-cola dick could win no he said what steady and read your Bible I mean pray and read your Bible that's kind of like that scripture resist the devil and he will flee from you you know that's going to change our body that one scripture is going to change our body resist the devil and he will flee from you and not to what the property God did in 1963 he resisted all that denomination he resisted all that ideas that he'd had before and when he resisted that idea there was a wild horse rider there was a seal broke and when that seal broke that rider rode away because he has attacked Satan had a taxi self like I said before Satan has attached himself to Christianity hello what do you think he's that in the bar room no he's right here he's sitting beside you look over there but we won't full fellowship because you know what that should be our desire that's what comes out and then and in the breaking of these seals it's not some great mysterious something it's still the very simple plan of redemption justification sanctification about genital hole goes now look the baby form justification is not going to change your body but it is a part of your body change amen because there is a time that way they'll knew he was lost because the things I did God went with me I promise you that now he might he knew like I said before when we get in the seals like when we get up into here sure we ought to be able to look back to Genesis 1:26 and see where we came from see what we're doing here and see where we're going to me that's all the seals are it's telling us where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going very simple all right so we can look back and see that sure we were in the mind of God like I said before Paul was in the mind of God Paul was a prophet and I think brother Brown said the prophets are born prophets amen but why did Paul persecute those Christians if he had something inside of him that was eternal no way people I believe you have to receive something God has to come down and burn that old person out of your soul and now he resides he will not dwell in an unclean vessel I was unclean but now I'm clean I know I'm clean you know why know why I'm clean I can look back and see what I came from what I'm doing here and where I'm going hey man so now let's read number one about 30 minutes cuz I'm gonna get out of here by 3:30 revelations chapter five number one see what it's doing is these seals opening up just begin to reveal the plan of the devil oh that's not what that's this because remember there is nowhere in Redemption that the devil is a part of except for he is your adversary he is the one that's driving you to that amen like I said before if Satan would have left Jesus alone brother Brown a saint would left Jesus alone he was trapped in that human body amen he looked 50 but he was 30 he could have just let him die and he'd just been one Jesus here that define but oh he couldn't do that he had to kill that man when he killed that man that's alright cuz I want to tell you Pentecost there was 120 little Jesus's bought so Satan had to deal with 121 little Jesus's then 3,000 downstairs went into the body of Christ Satan had 3121 Jesus has to deal with now he's got millions the poor thing every time he touches something he can't win for losing but it's those seals opening up just to begin to reveal the plan of redemption so that's what we're talking about what come with the plan of redemption we're not talking about some seventh under virtue message and some of this person's got to do this and that person's got to raise up and do this know the Holy Ghost is what's going to lead us through hey man if we find us a good Holy Ghost teacher he will lead us through a good Holy Ghost pastor I believe we found it we found him is here so wait a little look for him so we're at the end time these things are being reveal so you and I have to have a revelation number one that we were lost and that we were justified a gun chopped off our past sins they men but now we come though as we come through our journey listen to me as we come through our journey we see that that justification not only chopped off my past sense the real me didn't do it the one that now resides in my soul never sinned today don't who can hold to God's elect who can hold any mark because it's God that justifies a man now when you see that justification now that doesn't make you this tall that doesn't make you both fall I'm still a sinner brother Brent said I'm a sinner saved by grace and I'll remember that until the day my body's changed hey man I'll not forget that comes to me the plan of redemption is is for somebody to tell you you were lost but now through what I did not me I'm talking bout Jesus through Jesus and say what I did for you Susan for bush not for sister John for you that's why this is the personal revelation I told them before you want to know what the Seventh Seal is you know why there's silence anybody in this room except you tell me what my how I got converted and how God came to me and how that he spoke to me and the exact things he spoke to me you guys have been with me for a long time since somebody says brother Carly's been with me since I was a child tells you how old he is I mean a child but can you tell me my experience why because it's a personal revelation of what God has done for you I love to hear everybody's testimony but I like mine cuz it's personal now that silence in heaven because nobody can tell them you can I know you but I can't tell you what God did I'm sure I can see the things but I can't tell you the day that God saved your soul the day that God spoke to you I can't replicate that or duplicate that I have my own experience right well there's the end of the service let's go home but it's the Seventh Seal can't be any different it can't be anything higher than what we it can't be this we can have three wives heavenly days polygamy I don't want that revelation you boom are ones enough was enough one spleen but all these things that people have made it in the message it is your new birth it is that personal brother branham what is any birth it's why a revelation to Jesus Christ what personally to you the two big boxes we're back to reproduction and making honey revelation that God saved your soul you accept it and then he accepted what your faith amen remember it's not that you accept God it's God accepting you so God has to accept you through all this all these seals the white horse rider absolutely if there was a wild horse rider there had to be a white righteous church on the earth at the time that Satan begins his ride because remember Satan is not an originator sister Nicci Satan will never tell you something original he don't even have a seed to reproduce yourself he had to vicariously enter a beast to inject yourself in the human race but God just said let there be a man God just said let there be and you know what it came to pass Satan can stand down today he can say let there be let there be left everything they won't never happen how much power is that Satan has no power set what we give Him amen that all right say ma'am all right so we know now that the seals are the complete plan of redemption now the plan of redemption brother Dale's been talking about begins your journey amen towards your complete plan but you got to start somewhere like I was talking to him downstairs brother Lewis bringing the Sunday School really well it's just like me and you you know we we were talking back to people say well I'll tell you what brother Brown said after 63 and and and not before I said that same devil that same Devils in Delta it was down there when when they say oh it's just the Old Testament it was somebody taught that we thunk in one day and I was telling the sister I said sister I said Deuteronomy 29 says you need to wear clothes not pertaining to a man she saw us Old Testament I said what's them Ten Commandments you gotta turn your porch that we swear as Christians to go by that did that Old Testament here baby oh okay - no Testament so anyway so I mean really they get this new - lets the same thing same spirit let's all I'll tell you what brother mom said after 63 listen that's just like me going to my house and going I'm gonna build my roof brother John well John says we're gonna build it on I don't know I'm just gonna build a roof you gotta have foundation you gotta have the walls then you can put the cap on it and then that look real silly just hanging up there in the air but now it's got purpose because you got a foundation and then you build then you put the top on it for the problem is we've been trying to build from the top down I think the Bible says in the Old Testament that zerubabbel was sweep the foundation off and build from that amen then alright so that's what we're doing we're not sure we're talking about our our board against experience but we're bringing it to a little higher level we're going up a little bit higher so that God can speak to us more because like I said before I was looking up in there minute ago where I put in Holy Spirit cannot put that in your search engine and see what you come up with brother Brian said the Holy Spirit cannot override your unbelief he was in a prayer line he said sister the Holy Ghost can't over a Holy Spirit can't override your unbelief Wow the Holy Ghost is the healing folks he was standing right there ready to heal that woman and because of her unbelief and guess what brother Brown says oh I see you're a Christian because remember the prophet of God said he said a prostitute will go across the platform and get her healing and a born-again Christian will miss it why cuz you've got all that going around in your head I can't I can't I ain't good enough faith the prostitute just lost the princess I believe what you say and God works on her belief and heals her but a Christian walks up and goes old man I spoke cross to my neighbor on him I didn't do something at work you lose number you lose your healing a good Christian person what to me now listen this is just me these cells to me blows the cap off all that because if we can see the real revelation that we're justified amen if you're born again those who he has justified he is already glorified hello glorified you're glorified body it's not hanging up in heaven somewhere you're glorified body it's sitting right there in your seat oh I don't know about that unbeliever why you gonna get a new one we're gonna throw this in a way and get another one no mo I don't think so there was an empty tomb one time and that's the only one that's ever been and he entered into a glorified condition he took his flesh body and entered into a glorified condition hey man no one else has done that before we're not even nothing close to what we're done then all right we okay don't blame sister Nikki for this all this background see that Isis is a sweet lady all right so the first thing we saw though was the mystery of iniquity because they asked brother Branham in Thessalonians they said brother Branham is opening the first seal or the first seal a part of the mystery of iniquity they go to second Thessalonians 2 verse 7 pull it up please for the mystery of iniquity doth already work now that's Paul in this age right here for the mystery of iniquity because I want you to think about this before we start reading in just a few minutes in revelations cuz see now that like brother Bob said now that we see the seals open we can go back and read those church ages from revelations 2 all the way through the Ephesians pergamus and Thyatira Smyrna and pergamus aids I'm sorry the first three ages read those three ages we're fixing to and we're going to show how that first seal just jumps right out at you for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he's the prophet of God said God who now letteth will let in other words he's letting it happen until he the bride be taken out of the way now that's the quote out of the church age book I had it but I kind of condensed this all for today shall be taken out of the way so look like I said before the physical breaking of these seals are going to be after we're gone the man of sin sending temple of God showing us out to be ask God right amen all right and all these things but now you and I that's like people go real crazy you know when the brother Brown says the bride goes up in Revelations for one and not seen until revelations 19 they say well we don't even in there anywhere if you're not revelations 5 you've got a problem hello you got a problem if you're not in revelation 5 that's the call of redemption and the call of the book which has got your name in it amen but we get the spiritual part of all that revelations for one a church sure goes up revelations 5 tells me how I went up Redemption my name was called I answered I went up and then revelation 6 is to break into these seals to you and I to change these bodies not to make us Christians there'll be millions of people in that new city that are Christians that are born-again Rosalie's kingdom of God people that never had these seals break in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 only in this endtime did these seals break amen they didn't break they'd break - John John saw them I just read revelation 6:1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals who's talking to you John and I saw when the old one the seals I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see come here John I want to show you what's fixing to happen come here John I'm going to show you what's going to happen in a spiritual form but it's gonna have a natural happening y'all all right hey man what a matter o me thank you all right though the mystery of iniquity I just like I said before the mystery is now history we know where that iniquity that seat of Satan is if you're born again it's not in your soul nada not a speck of sin but now he can play in your body I'm not even in your body he can play in your spirit realm I ever tell you about memories and conscious fixing once or twice that's where Satan's playground is remember look your flesh doesn't sin you show it's sinful it come as a product of sin but this right here day if I don't make this hand do something that's not gonna do it you know what Satan can't even make this hand do anything but if he gets in plays in your spirit realm he can make you do a lot of things remember brother Brown said if you if Satan never comes into you remember you go out to him that's why he has no power to get in my soul anymore but through my memory reason conscious affection imagination he can play all day hey man my memory of what I used to do I can't forget but God said what sins are you dropped there my able to make a song about that what sins are you talking about that's what you bring them to God you say God forgive me of what I did 40 years ago thirty years ago twenty years ago ten minutes ago if you really did repent he'll say what sins you come see to me that's that justification that's bringing us up that pyramid not that we're so holy and righteous it's just that God did a work God didn't work and we got to depend on what he did if I depend on what he did follow his plan in his sixty-six book way of doing things prophet of God said I he said what he said God had a plan and a purpose and he was going to see it achieved how did he do that sixty-six books and a prophet and a bunch of eagles amen so the mystery of iniquity how's it going to be purged by mercy and truth iniquity is purged so there is a way out amen all iniquity oh you see iniquity and hundreds of times in the Bible but that one proverbs 16:6 by mercy and truth iniquity look it's purged now remember what I said before about purge that means something was in the line something was in the line it wasn't you were just so holy and righteous to begin with there was something in that line but by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart neither a man is that all right now justification we talked about justification they want to talk about this for just a minute go the next one please excuse me justification is a Hebrew word it means righteous as justified and vindicated by God the only way you can be justified is by God Amen so you take this white righteous church that's riding but you've got a real justified righteous church on the earth at the same time paul irene Paul Peter Paul James John all those ones they were righteous and justified listen listen so I said about the seals now you and I gonna have to come to a place to break this thing but all these people that are dead and went on there is justified as they'll ever be but they're waiting oh I love you that way no me and you they're waiting on somebody to go I'm justified why I'm alive hey man why God said so and I read an instruction manual you got that right isaiah 53:11 he shall see the travail of his soul that he shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many when he went to the cross he justified everybody he's ever gone justified he did it at Calvary amen oh think about a cleansing we need him got to sanctification yet this is happy enough being justified amen because we're getting into the second sailor that now we got a sanctification which pushes all out my righteous servant justify many for he shall what bared their iniquity amen he bore our iniquity Romans 3 verse 24 being justified freely by His grace through redemption there's that word through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom hath sent forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God so brother Branham is not the first person to come up with justification just chopped off you pay sins the Bible tells that amen I think that may be where the prophet got yeah I do too Romans 8 verse 29 for whom he does 400 dead for knew we love this one I do for who he did for knew foreknowledge first didn't predestination for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate so by foreknowledge he could predestinate absolutely there's no way you could have come but this way right alright but we didn't know that we didn't know that he did he did we didn't - where Redemption comes in that's why we're going to sing the redemption story that's why the angels cannot sing that song they never lost anything fool me did foreknow he also did predestinate what to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren look moreover whom he did predestinate them he called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified hey man so if you're truly justified today you're heading to glorification no way to lose it no way to lose it now you might have to go by the grave and you might have to go down and go over that six dimension for a little while but you know what as long as I'm alive there's one scripture that says we which are alive and remain I am going to say today I am a one of the I am a week because remember we talked about Apostle Paul Paul said they without us cannot be made perfect with Paul died he became a day and we became a nice Paul was looking back at the Old Testament he said they without less can be made perfect Paul became of a we're over here in the end time going thing without us cannot be made perfect I'm just telling you what God says it's not something I said that's what God said about a man I'm just quoting you I'm just quoting you want the instruction manual told amen alright let's read number two real quick visible Union we've read these before but you know what repetition you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated a man to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement so you did have an old book you did have an old book but like I said before when Satan walks up he goes you see this gun you see this he goes I don't see nothing what sin is you talking about saying says can't you read daddy said can't see a thing read the red it's white a man absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God our problem is is we don't have the mind of God in our memory reason conscience affection imagination but I'll promise you that inside man that one in your soul he's saying that right there he's saying that today hey man how could he denies word he can't denies words those who he's justified he's already glorified that's finished in his mind as I Carney said three turtle people who came down here to have a human experience hey man so that's where we're dead listen redemptions didn't happen in heaven weird em should happen on the earth amen we will never get nothing all right you're right same in all right tell you what we're gonna do let's go to the next one which says one God because remember to me the true revelation of the first seal is is the Lord your one Lord first seal first commandment thou shall have no other gods before me I was telling brother Lewis or brother Bob listen when you get a true revelation to one God see the Trinitarian doctrine has to go away that's what road when you get a true revelation one god you'll never baptized in the name of father son holy go when you get a true revelation one god there's not two lords when you get three revelation to one god there's no eternal hell you see all the doctrines that brother Branham sure he preached them but he said thank God for the opening of these seals you know what happened I'm just going to stop right here and we'll finish well don't do it next week listen a thunder have you ever been outside on a summer evening hey you ever been outside on a Sunday evening or something evening you sit out there and you hear this boom boom boom boom that's thunder right but somewhere oh I hope you get there somewhere a light came from nowhere hit the earth and said I'm here I'm here I am the light there had to be lightning before there was a thunder and then so what are the thunders it's the voice of God something coming from eternity to the present and saying I'm here and on that day when I feel broke the Prophet was telling us God is here and he said finally I've got somebody on the earth they don't believe what I said [Applause] there'll be no more denominations there'll be no more false doctrine boom there's your voice' garden cuz it's been bound listen they don't have this I'm just going to read and then we'll close we'll finish next Sunday Feast of the trumpets notice while that group is a riding riding making themself ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them there is another group I'm going to shape there's another group being made ready after a wild revelations 19 the next time the church is heard she comes also not upon his ankle of horses but the Bible says he was on a white horse the hosts of heaven would follow him upon white horses that's right while this group down here has got 2,000 bound at the river euphrates and has been bound for 2,000 years now what's he talking about from here to here it's 2,000 years all right and that's been bound for 2,000 years also that church has bound the Holy Ghost the church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years here we go under martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river euphrates but at the door of creeds and dogmas they mad that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because the man-made system but she's going to be liberated there's your lightning there's your thunder the prophet of God it's pronouncing that it's done she's now liberated that seals broken that horse rider is gone he's riding away she's coming back that's what the Bible said in those to meet one another on the battleground list for Michael like in the beginning they've been bound for 2,000 years almost 2,000 years let's listen rib one more future home 1964 he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and what was bound at Pentecost is balance forever oh but listen that's the reason the bride come in to reap review the second time there has to be a church called out of the latter-day listen folks the prophet of God said when we get what a revelation of the two spirits in the framework of the church now I'm not telling you I'm telling you message Church hey man because there's not two spirits of them out there in us in here now Satan's right here sitting on your shoulder going I wish to shut up I got a quote that brother Brown said went like that please people face final resting places in the Word of God if you can't put a quote in the Word of God you better find something else because you the one that's got the problem hey man real quick let's go to Revelation this is what I wanted to read now watch we're gonna read through it real quick and then we'll real will review it next Sunday sound all right I want you to look don't you have you ever noticed this chapter 2 the revelations chapter 2 verse 1 mm-hmm not to lose my voice unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus now go over there and read revelations 3 to lay out us it yeah because I'm going to read it to you real quick cuz remember the Alpha Brian Omega Brides gonna be the same unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus now watch every other church age it says to the Angel of the church in Smyrna in Pergamus entire in sardis in in in now watch verse 14 chapter 3 go 3 verse 14 unto the Angel of the Church of this is of Ephesus now go to revel that just scroll it up keep going to revelations 3 until the angel the church of the latter stands he's directing this straight to people Ephesus and lay out to see if it fails starting at Ephesus and it's gonna have to be resurrected in laughs there hey man all the others of the church end this is the Church of that's the Church of this is their job not to church in the Church of but watch let's go to revelations chapter 2 go back to 4 to 1 real quick until the Angel Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand what is this Church ages the locust in the myth 17 sticks I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles then or not and that's found them liars and has born and has patience and for my name's sake the name wasn't lost remember in that first church hey and for my name's sake hast laboured and that's not fainted nevertheless there's a horse rider there's a horse rider in your church age nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come quickly and remove your candlestick what your position out of its place except thou repent but this thou hast thou hatest the deeds watch deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate so he can't he commended that first church age he hate him I hate him amen but now watching the Third Age let's go he's a half the year Liam here what spirit said to church to him with overcome what give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the paradise of God to the Angel of the Church of Smyrna write these things says the first in the last which was dead in his alive I know thy works and tribulation and poverty to our rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they're Jews are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you'll be tried you have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit said in the church that he'll overcome with what shall not be hurt of the second death watch this now into the angel the Church of Pergamos this is the third age right here we're getting ready this horse rider it's fixing to change color and go into red right but now remember he said I hate today you hate the deeds and I hate the deeds right First Church age all right now watch this though you're in the third church age you've jumped about four hundred years and in time and in angel Church of Pergamos write these things says he will send a sharp sword with two edges he's got a sword Satan had a bow God's got a sword I know that works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is thou holdest fast my name now remember the third church age is still they had to write baptism in the right name all right and that's not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against a watch because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam this is not a deed who taught Balak a stumbling block before the children eat things like fine I don't commit fornication watch keep going gonna so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate it's went from a deed and you hated it too now I hate it go back down now who were we're now somebody in that church age is holding the doctrine of the Nicolaitans so you see how it their faith is being eroded and the Holy Ghost is being bound it used to be deeds which I hate and you hate now it's the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which I hate but you're holding the truth you're holding that doctrine and you're thinking this truth now what happens if Satan says okay hold on a minute I'm gonna say God said I'm gonna fight against them with the sword of my mouth he's a half an ear let him hear will just

feet god bless you we'll talk a little bit more than that this thing next Sunday the other Lord but I promise you if you ever hear the voice of God there is a lightning bolt come from eternity I told you many times before you do not get a revelation that originates in this dimension because remember I think about you remember this blood flight matter it shouldn't have been we should have been we should have been seven dimensional people hey man but God had to put us in one two and three to keep the sin away so there's no this it shouldn't even be so revelation doesn't originate here if you get a revelation from God it comes from eternity amen and it's the voice of God speaking to you thank you god bless you let's sing a song he's like you just a time you get a revelation it is a supernatural happening your parents can't give it to you nobody but God Himself can give you a revelation brother Branham never give one person revelation but God through William Branham gave me revelation gave you revelation I'm sorry going back page 372 in the spiral book my sins are gone amen hey man my sins are gone u.s.
