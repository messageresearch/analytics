eyes of my heart remember after the service now and going up and down with the canada family you know in the viewing and not like that and then remember the funeral service tomorrow there four o'clock just prayed the lord would would bless and guide each one all right so let's just sing as we invite brother aaron to come to speak unto it right open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of mine i want

light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy amen praise the lord could be in the house of the lord this evening amen so glad that he's here that we can see him amen because he said bless her day that hunger and thirst after after righteousness for they shall be filled amen amen so he's here for us to see him he's listening to brother branham the other day and you know like the little story about little boy trying to find god wanting to see god and that fisherman sitting out there watching god move in the storm and the rainbow and all that and he said that's all i've seen for 40 years is god and it's amazing people walk right past it and discount it right but god's in our midst glory because he's in each one because you're the representation of jesus christ the manifestation of jesus christ in this last day right so let's just uh look under the scripture we'll be reading from colossians 1 and then we're going to go to romans 16. you all just pray for me today i've got them all confused i've i'm all i i enjoyed what brothel had to say yesterday and and the minister's meeting up and i pulled a few quotes out of it and uh so y'all just pray for me it's it's completely jumbled so it's going to take the lord to make this thing work but uh you know i don't i don't trust in anything that i can do it's all what he can do amen so let's just bow our heads before we read the scripture dear heavenly father we thank you for this day lord for your many blessings on us and father we thank you for this time to to gather in this afternoon father i pray that you just come lord help me get out of the way that you can come speak speak the word to the people today what we have need of father i just pray that you touch each one that's here the sick and afflicted lord just be with the canada family lord lord we hate to to see our loved ones go but i believe the scripture tells us that you know we rejoice out of birth but we should be rejoicing at the passing lord that someone has finished the race lord that lord we lay aside this this mortal and take on immortality and lord we just thank you for brother george in his life and his testimony yes sir and we just pray that you bless and strengthen the family in this time and lord we just pray that you just come speak to each one lord there's so many around the world that have need some the bride around the world we think of uh brother ernie lord and the different ones we just pray that that have been mentioned lord each hand that's been raised today lord there's so many more needs than we can we can mention lord but we're so thankful that you're mindful of every single one of them and we just pray that you come this evening speak to us lord is committed all to you in jesus christ's name amen amen colossians chapter one we're going to begin verse 21 it says and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ and my flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of his mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily right now we go to romans chapter 16 verses 25 and 26 now he says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith amen amen lord add his blessing to the reading of words you may be seated see i uh found out yesterday i was going to be speaking today so i i was at home done a little i was just doing studying praying just trying to find what the lord having me say and looking over some things and i found out that uh looking back it's been today's been it makes 17 years since i since i preached my first sermon 17 years on a sunday evening and just say it's all all by the grace of god and if and if i and if i'd do anything it's not been me it's been him i give him all the glory and the honor for it and uh y'all just pray for me but you know sometimes we look at we look at things in life on and we wonder why things happen the way they do yeah and you know we can say life comes with it doesn't come with an instruction manual but we have the scriptures right and and things don't make sense to us and things don't work out the way we want them to but we know paul said in romans for all things work together for the good to them that love the lord who are they called according to his purpose so all the things that happen to us happen for a reason and i don't know if y'all ever heard the little story about the man pushing the rock man had a dream had this huge boulder in front of him and the lord tells him says i want you to push this rock so the man gets out there and day after day he struggles against that rock and he pushes and he pushes and he pushes and he never and he does that every single day and thing never moves but he goes out there every single day he's just pushing pushing pushing pushing just wearing out the ground around it just trying to push that thing and he goes back the next day and he's doing it just keeps on continually pushing on that rock and one day he stops and says lord he said i've been pushing on this rock for so long he said but i've never moved it but the lord said did i ever tell you to move the rock he said i said push the rock he said i never said move the rock but he said i want you to take a look at yourself from where you were he said you were weak and thin he said look at the muscles that you have look at the calluses that you have look at the chains that was made in you see it wasn't that you were supposed to move the rock to change your situation but your situation was given to change you but you overlooked so you did not realize what was taking place that the change was supposed to be made in you and you know that's it i see that sometimes you look and say well why don't things change and you're looking for change sometimes it's not the change in the situation it's the change in you and so that's what i thank the lord for you know i i may not even get to my to my text and not because i don't but uh you know i y'all just y'all just pray for me but you know i had a grandmother that was in brother branham's meetings and you know brother brown said they would be looking over the banister yeah you know from that dimension down right you know one of these days i you know i just pray the lord lets her look over and see right that's right because what i want to be because you know she prayed for us all the time when nobody else held the token my grandmother held a token over us and you know i see what what is what has come you know she done her part and she ran her race now i want to do my part and run my race you know she's over there but somebody's got to call her back somebody's going to call her out of the ground and you know i think brother dale you know he says all them all the different brothers over the years and he said i thank god for each one of them because they helped me and you know exactly i look back over the years of the of the ones that that i that i've been associated with and when i was when i was 21 i'd been in the world and it was right after my grandmother had passed and the lord the lord was dealing with me my grandmother grandma gray was laying in the hospital florida and we went down there and we stayed with some some people from the church and the and the lady was and they were just super sweet to us and i was laying on her couch one night and you never you just y'all just pray for me i'm just but you know i knew grandma always prayed for us and every time i got in trouble every time i felt bad i'd call grandma on the phone yeah if i got sick if i needed somebody to talk to i called grandma and you know what because i knew she could reach chavin and i was laying on the sister in florida's couch i was standing there and she had she had the cod books on her on her coffee table there and i reached down and i got one of those one of those books and i tell you i'm sorry people can say whatever whatever they want to and the the people can say whatever they want to about this message i know that it's real you can say whatever you want to about god i know he's real glory amen just like brother tony was preaching wednesday night i'm too far down the road i've seen too much i've experienced too much you could i mean it don't matter i know i know where i stand and when i got a hold of that book and i just started reading and i tell you the lord if i've ever had the lord speak to me i know him speaking to me and you know she was laying in the hospital and they didn't give her much much time to live and i still remember the lord telling they're telling me said you know you've been following your grandmother she's applied the token to you said i want you to come and walk with me right right it's time for you to make your decision and you know i couldn't get away from that we after she had her funeral i just carried that from and i got back to tennessee was living in tennessee and i got back home and i couldn't get away from it then i knelt beside my bed one evening and i said god i can't live like this because there was something that stirred inside of me i couldn't get away from amen and you know i appreciate god and i appreciate him coming and bringing me to the place that i needed to be it's the mercy and grace of god that he calls us he brings us to this place and i the first church that i went to with brother james tibbles and i appreciate brother james if there's one thing brother james ever taught me was one thing that there was going to be a take a five-fold ministry to perfect the body the saints would only be perfected through five four minutes and i've heard you know he had he had a lot not just brother benham's tapes but he had a lot of ministers from the message had their tapes and i've sat down and and the way i know about doctrines in this message as i've i've heard i've heard all kinds of things that's been preached so you know some things is not is is not a hearsay thing i know what people have preached and and i have heard things and i've sit there and held onto things it's like lord i don't understand this and one of the one of the doctrines is the first time that i i ever heard anybody preach on the river jordan it was like something it was like rubbing a cat the wrong way i guess is is one way of expressing it i mean it felt like you know somebody was just it was something was crawling all over me and i sat there and i said lord i don't understand that that don't make any sense but i never could put my my finger on it and i said well lord i'm just going to hold on to that because i know what brother branham said but it said there's something wrong here i can't put my finger on it but for some reason i know what the prophet said but it takes you to come and reveal the scripture right because if it's not you coming then it's not going to make any sense and you know there's other questions that i've had but i had that question and i held it for so long and that was that was years i'm i'm i'm guessing probably three years i held that until i'm until i come to lula until i met brother dale and and and there were other things that i had questions about and all of a sudden just just sitting here and and listening to the scripture see we are so blessed see many people are walking in darkness they're walking in confusion right but you know what it doesn't it's not it's not to elevate a man it's not it's not because we're not here to build a kingdom right because all we're trying to do is get get a a body ready a bride ready to get out of here because you know what all of this we understand all this is satan's eating satan's going to have his dominion and he's going to destroy it he's in the process of it and we understand that a curse is down on america we know we know what the end is going to be so all these things we understand what's going to take place what's going to happen but i i'm more interested in getting out of here and i just i just thank the lord that you know some people have have tried to blind the people and you know they only want you to hear them we got you got preachers that they want to give you their revelation but it's not going to do any good because if it's not a revelation from god it doesn't help anybody it's only it's only because brother brown said it was the holy ghost that was the only divine interpreter of the truth of the rev to reveal the word and if it didn't take the holy ghost to come and reveal the word then it's not any going to do any good and i appreciate i appreciate a pastor that that i had that i was able to listen to learn that he wanted us to to uh to read because the scripture tells us said in the last days it would deceive it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if possible that's right but you know what he said he wouldn't deceive the election amen so if there's truth out there then you know because as as the scripture says as brother branham was telling us he said if there's a deep that's calling out there's a deep to respond to that and so so there's an opportunity to reach out and we're able to study and listen because a lot of people maybe they just skimmed over those things maybe they just said well that was brother so-and-so who preached that and they just swallowed it hook line and sinker but you know i say it's the grace of god that something stopped me one day that stopped me to that is that what is this because something didn't make sense and then that i was able to have somebody i could have just stuck it on the shelf and i guess ignored it but i had a desire to have have an answer brother brown said if you've got an answer he said he'll put someone in behind the pulpit to give you your answer right right so so there's somebody here that will give you the answer that you're looking for right but you sometimes you may have to hold on for a while you may have to say well lord i don't understand but you know i know what the prophet's message is true but there's one thing about it it takes it takes more than just reading books it takes more than just just reading the listening to a prophet speak because if it doesn't take the holy ghost to come and and open the word to us then it doesn't do us any good right and it's one of the things that brother dale was speaking of yesterday in the minister's meeting you know speaking and the topic was the seventh seal and i know it was so good that you know the the stress was was made on one point see people want to look matthew 24 or revelation or everything but the important part was ephesians 4 30. because if you don't receive the seal of god don't worry about any other seals in the bible because the first main the main seal is is the holy ghost because if you're not going to receive that seal then don't worry about the seven seals in the book whether they're on the inside or the outside because if not then because he's only going to reveal to those in that special class so you've got to be in that group because as brother m said you've got to be sealed with the book so you've got to be sealed right and if and if that doesn't take place then it doesn't matter and see there's only one seal at all right right right exactly because who did he say that he said the book and he said revelation and the lamb took the book and he said who had it sealed he said it was the holy ghost so if the holy ghost had the book sealed then the only way that you're going to receive the revelation is to have the one that sealed the book inside of you so if you you've got to receive that seal and see that's what that's what's lacking in in the message today people people have heard and they and they walk around and they listen but one thing that they they have failed to receive is the new birth right amen amen see that is that is the part that we've got to catch and if we don't catch that then the rest of it doesn't mean anything because that's what i believe is is the most important aspect of this entire christian journey i think as brother dale says you know i'd rather be seeking god every day of my life and have it the whole time then think i've got it and come to find out i don't right it's it's it's that important but i just just want to thank the lord that one day that uh never never heard of lula georgia before i was in tennessee and they met sarah and came down and got to meet anna and i think the first i think the first time i ever come to this church i preached preach on a sunday evening but uh you know i i'd heard people say that stay away from you got to watch brother dale you got to watch it you got to watch this sam dale but you know what it goes back to when uh brother james instilling in us not to listen to what people say not the congregation not other ministers but listen to what people's being what's being preached that's what's what's what you have to listen to so you've got to take it and listen to it for yourself to find out what's being said and through that i can i say i appreciate god because amen the more i heard the more i understood and people can say whatever they want to but the more the more it became real to me and there were things that i understood and i said well and and you you can understand things carnally you underst because brother ram said you can have a mental conception of it you can have it in your mind and you know it but it not be a revelation and there were things that that i had read that i thought you know and this is the way i see it but i said well i don't know if that's if that's true but i don't see anything that contradicts this but you know i would have my own i guess you could call it my own idea but that's what i saw and you know i'd never heard anybody preach because a lot you know how many people how many times you've been places and hear people preach and it's the same old same old and nobody ever gets into anything deep and if you ever want you ever want to see preachers shuck and jive just ask them questions the next thing you know they are always moving around and you know they they're they're greater sometimes preachers act greater than politicians at dodging questions they talk a whole lot never answer anything yeah but you know there were times that i held on to things and i'm so glad that i came to a place that i heard brother dale preach things like you know what i understand that that was things that god showed me and there was a lot of things i held on to that i realized that that i that i saw in the scripture and and honestly it's just like if you know i never did believe in the trinity from the time i come in this world the first time i ever had a conscious thought i always knew brother branham was a prophet i never believed in the trinity but you know what i had misconceptions of this message that we held on to just the same as if we were trinitarians we were just con just as much confused as everybody else is in the world and i'm so glad that i had somebody that i that could come you know it's not it's not a man that's right but it's a vessel it's a ministry it's a gift that somebody can come that god can speak through to speak to you to answer the questions that you have that you've received and it's so amazing because you you see things and and you and you read it right and you read it right yeah you know i i was reading i was listening to somebody and i can't remember who was being where they were talking about martin luther said how many times do you think martha and martin luther read habakkuk how many times do you think he read that the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith how many times how many times do you think that brother branham read malachi 4 and read revelation 10 7. how many times did paul read the old testament i mean here was here's a great learned man that read through the whole old testament i mean he could tell you all the things that moses said right i mean all the all the levitical rules and laws and all those things he knew him he could read them but the one thing i was liking to paul was paul never saw jesus in that he never saw the christ and so it's the same way we can read a lot of things but we don't see christ in it it doesn't become it's not real to us and yet so we have misconceptions of things that we hold on to why because that's all we've been told just as brothers how about you you've been talked which is your right hand and your left hand that's all you've been taught that's right so that's that's why that's why you see it that's the way you read it but then all of a sudden one day as you're reading the scripture it comes open to you you know i was i had i had one of the first times that that really in my life that really struck me i i've been reading the book the masterpiece and i'd read through it and uh i was i got a video of uh brother harold hildebrand preaching a special meeting and that's what he was preaching on the masterpiece and i was listening to him preach and and i thought well that can't be the same message that i've read and i had to go back and get the book and he was bringing things out of there that i that i read but i didn't but it didn't strike me but all of a sudden i was sitting there reading listening to brother held preach that and all of a sudden it was it was standing out to me i was like wow that's amazing i had to go back and look and there it was i'd read it but the inspiration never struck me and then all of a sudden it came a time that the inspiration struck glory and when the inspiration struck then it was like wow it was amazing and another point of of the scriptures that stand out to me is romans 8 and i've i've i've spoken on that before is you know i had brother dale preached on romans 8 and and went through the whole chapter one time many years ago when you know i can't read romans 8 the same way i used to right why because it's been illuminated it's been open so when i see this it looks totally different than the way i used to see it because you know when i read romans 8 i don't read somebody else i read myself so when i'm reading the scripture and when you you look into the scripture are you reading because i'm not when i read abraham i'm not reading abraham i'm reading the seed of abraham that's right i'm looking i see myself i see me there i can't get away from that because that's what the scripture has come to do is to eliminate illuminate to us to us to see who we are to see what god has done for us and we'll run out of time ain't even got started yet terrence tommy had 30 minutes and the check was no good so how many minutes i got left one okay now from now on i'm going to be preaching for free all right all right but uh oh and that's just kind of a little background of what i wanna now i'm gonna start with a real sermon but anyway uh it was just a little bit of because it stirs something inside of you sometimes when you when you hear things and you know that's what paul said you know stir up your remembrance stir up your pure minds in the way of remembrance exactly things that you've heard right but you need to you need to be stirred up a little bit and you know one of the things that brother dale was when he was ministering yesterday and if y'all want to if they've got the they've got the scriptures i don't know who's back there brother bob but anyway uh ii peter 119 says we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts now that's that's the scripture that i want to want to get to but the the scriptures that i read in in romans and in colossians and romans it tell romans 16 it tells us he says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith amen and the the title that i have is the mystery and secret of god right because there there's a mystery but there's a secret and if you go back to the to the message christ the mystery you'll you'll find brother madam really deals with with a mystery and a secret right amen because he said because even brother madam calls it a hidden mystery yeah and it says the date on here peter says the day dawn and the day star arrives in your hearts amos 3 7 tells us says surely the lord god will do nothing right but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets and then he said in revelation 10 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared unto his servants the prophets now mystery i don't know if they've got this but uh mystery means something not understood or beyond understanding a religious truth that one can know only by revelation and cannot fully understand right and and that struck me because brother branham said in uh i believe it's his serves as it's the time he that's where he goes back he says a mystery is a scripture a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element but which a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation and then a secret means kept from knowledge or view revealed only to the initiated designed to elude observation or detection or working with hidden aims or methods right so we a mystery and a secret and brother branham goes on to talk about in christ the mystery he says now god's secret mystery he had before the world began but back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star adam or molecule or anything he was god but he wasn't exactly god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't anything there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed right and in him was love and him was to be father and him to be son in him to be savior and him to be a healer all these great attributes that we already see expressed they were in god and let's go to the the next one brother brother brahms continues on 17 17 1 here says god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then oh i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence and that just really stood out to me when brothel was speaking on the on the seventh seal to understand why the why there was silence to understand god had a secret to be revealed and you know to understand what a secret was because the bible tells us and there are several different scriptures that talk about the revelation was headed sure the mystery was hid and so it was hid and so it was a secret brotherhood said there was a seek god had a secret of what he wanted to do but he didn't even let the angels understand he didn't let anybody know what was going to take place it was hid and see a secret is something that's hit from view see there was something that he had that he didn't want anybody to know and so when somebody and a just a simple illustration but i want y'all to catch what i'm saying i hope i don't confuse you but little kids will come up to you and say i got a secret well as soon as you come up and tell me i got a secret it ain't a secret anymore you know what it become a mystery because if you don't tell me i got a secret it's a secret but as soon as you tell me i got a secret it becomes a mystery because it never becomes a question of what is it right that's right and i kept i was talking to brother matthew bray last night on the phone and we were we were talking i said i can't remember which one of the there was a bobby lewis and clark i can't remember which one of the explorers years ago they had black people with them in their in their expedition and the indians the native americans had never seen black people before they had seen white people but never seen black people so when they came into camp the black the indians the native americans were so amazed that they were black people and they were kind of like little standoffish they were amazed and after they got over their initial shock and scaredness you know they walked up to them and and they were amazed and they tried to rub the black off of them but see if if if the native americans had never seen it then it was a secret to them because it was never known to them exactly but then all of a sudden when it became known it became visible then it became a mystery because then it was like what is this right and so that's what the secret was as long as nothing was ever known but he had something that he wanted to express but he didn't let anybody know of it and then and brother branham goes on in christ the mystery and he and he tells us in time as he was going on that through the prophets and the masterpiece he said the prophet uh the foundation was laid by the patriarchs he said the prophets built the body and he said it was little by little but they didn't understand he said it was head he said each part of that was hidden but it was being made manifest and all the way through the scripture it was hidden and so all these things were hidden through the scripture but it was god's plan and so in time through through the prophets they caught a part of the mystery right but the main part of was still a secret because there was only a part of that mystery that was being made known and so in time as he came through then each one of them picked up picked up where the previous prophet had left off or the patriarch had left off and picked that up and continued to carry it and it became more of a mystery but underneath that mystery laid a secret glory and so then it became owned and it continued on until the end time and so we we still still have a secret sure but he came to that place and then brother branham said that god had a had a mystery that had a a threefold revelation but it was a secret right and so as as time went on we seen how the scripture tells us it continues to tell us that it was a threefold revelation that went through this this secret was kept but then it came to a time that it took a profit to unfold these things the scriptures the those hidden truths because he said he said it would take the seventh angel to come and through him that we would speak those divinely mystery truths to make them known see the scripture tells us has told us all the way through that what was what was going to take place but it laid but it was laid there right and you know just as brother was speaking of in the seals when you when you look at the under the first seal see people only see the mystery of it because all they see is well i see a white horse rider but they've missed but they've missed the the greater part of it they've missed they've missed the part that was secret right and people read the scripture and say well it was a lamb that took the book but the greater part of that was that when brother branham stood there and said here stands a lamb with the book in his hand see people miss that because he said see you people have not called what's been going on all this week because it was them it was the lamb that came and was opening the word but see they missed that and it goes and you look back and it's all the way through the scripture see everybody looks and you know go back to the children of israel the children of israel could see the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire they could they could see that that god was above them but they couldn't see god was with them they saw the pillar of fire and they could see when the when the when the cloud came down in the tabernacle but they couldn't see god in flesh in the in the man moses see brother said they missed they missed the grace of god because he said they had water out of a rock he said they had manna come out of the sky they they missed all of those things he said the brazen serpent the grace of god gave them all those and that's what they missed there was there was god in there in their midst and they missed him amen right and that's what and you go through all the through the scriptures you see the same thing that there was a secret and it was and it was a mystery and many times we can we can read this we read the scripture but we've missed what we've missed seeing him right that there's a secret there and that's what brother branham came to do in this last days is to unfold what was in the scripture what laid there was always there right right in in we're going to see if we can find this one this is sir is this the the end 1962 you know and then brother branham speaking of the vision and he talks about uh the wrecking bar one of the things that brother brown brother was speaking of yesterday about you know brother branham was was telling the vision and he said he took that wrecking ball the crowbar and he said you know he said i struck the top you struck the top of the mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap off of it and it was in the shape of a pyramid and you're at the top of it often there was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached and he said beneath that was white stone granite and he said the sun or the light has never shined on this before he said look on this watch this and that's right because in the formation of the world the world was formed before there was light we know that god moved upon the water in the beginning he spoke for light and naturally down and there in the age that formation was the light had never come upon that stone he said look upon this light has never come upon this before and when all of them got up and i told them to watch and all of them come up and look in and he said while i while they were looking in he looked out of the corner of his eye i believe it was and watched me i slipped off to one side heading toward the west going down the hill going down the hill coming up the hill going downhill getting smaller small all the time and he said then the brother turned around after a while and said did he vanish where did he go and he said some took out that way some took one way and some another but a very few stayed and looked on what i had told them but notice the interpretation of the dream which i never told him one thing another things that i tell you but that's what he was talking about he was talking of the word right he said light had never shined on this the word everything that brother branham preached lays in the in the in the bible there wasn't anything that he added there wasn't anything that he he took out of somewhere else it laid in the word but that's what he was talking about when he saw that vision see there was a cap that was on the on and he said he opened it up and he said that the stone was laying there the stone that was rejected but it was still there it was in there and he said the light had never shined on this before but he told them he said stay here and look on this because he had to go west but he said keep looking on it what was it they were supposed they would stay with the word because you know he's preaching he said we're waiting for the revelation of this to come see he knew that he said i must decrease brother said i must decrease that he might increase why because he was pointing them to the word glory and see the brother had the vision and brother was telling them keep your eye on this stay here and look on this but he said what happened they ran away from it he said but a very few stayed and looked on it why because they missed him see that was a mystery but you know what the secret was coming there was a there was an unfolding of the word glory see people people have it all mixed up and they and they think that brother branham done something it wasn't he was he was as brother tim calhoun was speaking of yesterday you know brother said i'm perfectly mute he was perfectly mute until he came it was and then he was just the mouthpiece that was predestinated to come at this appointed time to stand here and god could use his voice to speak amen and that's what he came to do was to speak the word you know you know what it you know you go through the scriptures and look you know serpents see late in the scripture it's always been there all of all of these great mysteries that lay in here all about no eternal hail i mean the truth the truth of baptism the new birth all the different things that were going to take place we understood how how god is is coming that's going to how the they have bringing the redemption to israel an end time messenger coming it laid in the scripture all these things were there but it took some it took somebody to come right that hadn't had the had a prophetic gift right to come and it wasn't brother brown that opened the word to us but it was that same one that came that he could that he could speak through someone all right to open this scripture up exactly because you know i i don't care what what if brother brenham done anything in his life you know or whatever you know he could have been a drunk or whatever it didn't matter but you know what did he point me to you know that's the reason i don't you know if it doesn't matter if what if the preachers are wrong if they can point me to christ that's what i want to see you know i i think about you know i believe balaam you know sitting on a donkey you know the donkey was able to see the angel with the sword amen exactly balaam couldn't see that right but you know god had had to speak through that dumb animal right to the prophet i see to make you understand right right and whatever it takes for us to see then that's what that's what i'm looking for but that's what i see is that we have seen god has come to open his word to us that we can speak that he can speak through us and so we can we can read the scripture but you know what it there still lays a supernatural element there to it amen that's right so because that doesn't when you read then all of a sudden things stand out to you and when they stand out to you then then it can be revealed that's right amen because if you don't if you don't hold the word it can't be revealed to you that's the reason that everybody gets all kin are all confused about uh you know having where's the seed lay in you and having being predestinated and understanding all of these things why because it's a representation of predestination there is a seed there but it's representation right because even ephesians 2 tells us you know we were born just like everybody else in this world was we were born the children of wrath even as of amen it says we were dead in sin and trespassed and it says you had to be quickened right you had to hear the word ephesians 1 tells us that we had to hear the word the gospel of our salvation that we can be sealed by it right that's right see you had to you had to hear something i know it don't make me any better than anybody else in this world why because i came the same way i came under the same sin curse that they came under that's right amen but you know what i had to hear the word i had to hold on to the word and then god in his infinite grace unto me could be revealed to me and so it has been a it's it's still a secret to people we say it's it's a mystery yeah it's a mystery but a lot of people they they've never seen it right it's still a secret it's still a secret we still have there's still a secret coming that's right when did when did when did jesus christ start his coming where they he's it's been ever since the day of pentecost he's been coming to the people to the bride since the day of pentecost he's been revealing his word since the day of pentecost it has been unfolding since the day of pentecost right and as as time has progressed then you then you understand it and as you see it it god couldn't do it any other way the plan of god could not ever come any other way because you know he birthed because he was the seed and he came forth and he said that seed had to go into the ground to reproduce in the last day to be the very thing that he was he came in flesh to be sin that we might be the righteousness the righteousness of god that we might be the re um the manifestation of what he is because he said you know if a seed dies and it doesn't go in the ground it abides alone but it has to go into the ground and you know you see these things and you know i was listening to brother branham the other day and you know he was telling the story about the man that you know he said what kind of god would you have and you know he just had his hands across them in the in the dark ages and watching them die and now you know how they were all being killed and they had they gave their lives but you know they were anointed for their for their ministry they were anointed for their time because you know this the scripture tells us under the under the seal it tells us that he came to he had the sword and he came to take peace from the earth but you know the one thing they couldn't do was because he said they gave their lives because they were under anointed under that calf anointing they gave their lives you couldn't take it from them so it was not anything that one because it because they realized to give up their life was a great game to god because they had something better laid up than what was down here so you wasn't taking anything from them because you were sending them to their better place see and so when the devil thinks he's got something on us he don't have anything on it and so that's what we see in this in this hour we have seen the unfolding but see there's a there is a secret and you know what it's only to a very few well because we're still we still there's a mystery to be made known but when it's made known then you extended his brother branham was talking about we're waiting on the coming of the lord but he's not saying i'm not saying he's coming he said i'm saying he's here see everybody gets all confused about you know the appearing and the coming and all the different comings in the scripture but you know what if you allow him to come and speak to you it lays out perfect that's right see there's only there's only one revelation of the word there's only one revelation and there's only one way to take this word right here and make it line up right and he said he said that he take this word and every part of it dovetail together there's only one way for that to take place and that's if he is revealing the word amen not anybody else can reveal the word he reveals the word and if we if we understand that god has given us this message and that's the reason why you can't just take it and say brother branham say it brother branham said you can read off you can read out of the book and say well brother branham see it well that's not going to help you because it doesn't mean anything until it becomes real to you until it's a revelation to you if it's not if it is if it's not a revelation to you not just saying what he said because he said no one can call jesus to christ except it be by the holy ghost you can't you can't call this word the word unless it be by the holy ghost you can't speak this word unless it's by the holy ghost because it's him speaking through you brother venom said he said in the last days you know he was speaking and he said you know are we all going to be able to do miracles are we just going to be doing it by the holy ghost he said we're all we're you know all able to do miracles but he said it's by the holy ghost it takes the unction of the holy ghost to do miracles but see you know a lot of people say we're just going to give it to brother wade to do all the miracles or somebody else to do things no it's every single one of us you know i was i was reading the story about the lady that was uh you know she was in the had the in the prayer line had the baby you know it says the had a it was a blue baby and the lady was standing you know she was a christian and the lord kept telling her said go pray for that baby and you know she kept trying to get away from and the lord kept telling her you need to go pray for that baby and she said a little bit later she the lady come by and she had a prayer card in her hand and said well brother branham will pray for pray for the baby he said no you couldn't get away from that and finally you know she had she went up and had the lady sit in her chair and uh you know pray for the baby and then you know she went up set up way up in the balcony there and you know brother branham said you know when she come across the platform she had a prayer card and they thought you know you tell there was something wrong with a baby but you know he walked up there and said sister this baby's already healed said that lady in the balcony up there on the end of the road there in the third balcony or whatever said you know she prayed for it said the baby's healed amen brother ram said that lady up in the balcony about fell out of her chair but see that was god she had the action of the holy ghost to do something that's right and that's what it takes it's not it's no big eyes or little uses every single one of us that we all work together and that's and that's what comes through the opening of the word is is to understand who you are that's right and when when this when does people say well getting back to yesterday is the seventh seal open is it closed is the lamb off the mercy seat is he on the mercy seat and you can only speak by your revelation amen right right that's all brother branham could do he said this is my revelation that's all he could speak of and it that's what it is so when you say is the seventh seal what is the seventh seal it's what it what is it to you amen when the word opens to you what was the seal to do reveal christ do you see christ that's what it takes it's to you because you so anybody as brother dale always tells us listen he can't he can't say nobody else has a is born again except for him that's the only person but do you have the holy ghost amen because he said if you have the new birth he said then he will lead you and guide you into all truth and it's not just reading but it's for him to come personally to you what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen exactly when he was when brother brown was speaking in christ in mystery and i didn't get to it because i'm trying to wrap up here but when he was speaking in christ's mystery when he when he starts speaking of that threefold revelation then he goes right in he says then what is the new birth it's that revelation you've got to have a revelation of jesus christ in the new birth and then from there from there you can see all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into you and brother branham said also in 1964 he said all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the believer he didn't just say the bride he said end of the believer that you and i become the fullness of jesus christ amen we are we are the we are christ made manifest the fullness of the godhead bodily amen see you've got to see who you are i've got to see who i am and then when we see that he said we can be an invincible army and then the rapture can go amen god bless you i saw stand i tried to keep an hour i thank the lord for what we've seen and what we've heard god had a hidden mystery it was hid but see that's the reason that it's so it's so important as brother was telling us yesterday when he got down toward the end of of this of his sermon you know he was talking about brother branham he said you know he said i can put my confidence in him what god gave him through that god can come speak to me so we we know that it had to come down to this time no other time but this time that god promised to send elijah to send a prophet to this age a seer someone that he could speak through he said he come to top all the loose sins all the way through history he said those fellas he said they probed at it but there come one now and perfectly vindicated see people people have tried to discredit this message and everything that brother branham's done and everything that he said and you know what a lot of times the more they try to prove him wrong the more they try to they end up proving him right but you know the scripture tells us in the last days scoffers would come you're right that's right and he said because of this he said they're ignorant peter said they're ignorant right one because lots of times they read but they're confused on what they're reading and so without without having one to show them they're confused so then they say well it's all just all messed up it's just a bunch of goop whatever you know but it takes an eye of revelation and that's what's been promised in our day and i'm so thankful for that brother go ahead let's try number 217 amen if you have an egg this evening like prayer one god can do it is no sneaky was that someone new you may ever but do not be disheartened for i am there is wherever there is no power what god what he's done for us what god oh oh lord of lords hey um oh oh bye come on i'm amen love the lord this evening amen amen all hearts and minds clear before we go this evening amen as we go just remember the services coming up in the different ones as we go wes brother call if you don't mind dismiss this in the word prayer heavenly father we are so grateful lord and thankful that we have one that we can call upon in time lord one that will guide us lord while we pray that it will find a resting place in our hearts and especially in jesus christ thank you me um
