whoa amen we holy I me a man is that what you want to do a baby was so much so you see them through the word right Amanda does he have been in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn back where we've been reading revelations one and then we'll read from first Corinthians 15 revelations 1 1st Corinthians 15 remember the fellowship meeting will be this coming saturday at brother Longoria's in alabama if you want to go with us make sure you let us know we'll be leaving about 12 30 11 o'clock 1030 would be better and we always try to give a little time we leave early but we give a little time we can always stop somewhere and sit down better than we can push the hard trying to get during problems but it'll be according to the weather because they're supposed to be bad all week but we'll see about that okay so we'll just pray one for another men I think that's all we got two announcements to make revelations 1 1st Corinthians 15 father we thank you for an opportunity to be able to gather this afternoon we thank you for you loving your grace unto us thank you for your goddess your understanding most of all thank you for you cause without you there would be no hopes and what any of us would be able to do or anything the breath we breathe they are we breathing that air is this this has come for you and we thank you Lord just bless us all together now as we talk about you forgive our sins and listen that understanding do as you said in your word you would send your word and heal us so we thank you in Jesus name Amen first the revelations one says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass in the sentence signified it by his angel to his servant John the by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw this did he that readeth them they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written our end for the time is at hand what is that time at hand remember how we brought it out the time to understand if there's ever been a time to understand I believe we're here don't you if not when are we going to get here you know we're all getting older and everything else flip them we better start depending on alright first Corinthians then 15 and we'll go over verse 23 to make sure you understand who is talking about whatever man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God now listen to the scripture even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority in power for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed his death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under him it is manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and while all things shall be subdued unto him then he at that time or shortly thereafter then shall the Sun I will show himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all you may be seated the Lord at is blessing to the reading of the word now is to try to finish up a little bit of what we were talking about this morning and continue home I don't believe that God gained attributes coming into the world I believe he had all the attributes better and said that he was a father he was a here hyuna Savior but there was nothing there to make it manifest you know no wait or nothing but that didn't mean that he had to wait until he came here to be that he always was that that was a part of him see you know like that and then being a part of him we just see on this side the display of it all right now he never gained any attributes all right because he had those attributes okay now do you what I'm saying it wasn't display we know that but that'll be the key to help you to understand later in what we're talking about but yet still he never gained any and all so now he never loses any attributes know if he lose anything that it's not of God you know if you know what you say well okay we're going to do away with this but that would be doing with God why just like I am I'm a son of my father me I became a father I mean I came a husband when my wife and I married that made me a husband that this gave me a title me that would be there you know as a part of my life an attribute all right then I became a father buy my wife a night together that made me a father well that didn't change me the attribute was there in me but it was just not being displayed all right then I became a grandfather did that change me did that add to me anything different from what I was no did it take away anything no see now I'm a great grandfather well see that's that's something but and I'm still the same one you know it's not a whole bunch more that I've got to gang this or do this or do that and and it's not that God has to do these things and then one of these days so now when we get out into work that we're talking about it we've already done this but I'm trying to make sure you understand when we start talking at the end of the message about the sonship how it would be surrendered that God might be all in the hollers we've just read in the scripture don't look at something being done away with it's not when we get over on the other side we will have an eternity for taking on the eternal revelation run around said me of God we're just giving enough here to be able to go higher to be able to understand what he will be telling us then me all right how do you think we're going to get you so when we're gonna set a fire on file to fiddle around play harps or do something you know what no no it's gonna be a wonderful partaking probably said they'd be a message is here to be given all right so they must be more of God that he has not been not have not revealed to you or not it must be more than he's not even written in his word to be able to reveal or it would not be a message of Tara you would only be much already read see we're getting just enough here to be able to understand to keep that part in your mind now alright so now i have not trying to back up too far but to try to get a point to you me do we believe in eternal son ship that was the line point of trying to do brain fourth then we believe in eternal sons you know we believe in eternal God ship we believe in eternal God head those were the things that gave you this morning to read now you said well how can it be eternal Godhead rodel when you when you say that a son is not eternal now watch the point if it was something else going out of in going over you would be talking in the wrong way but who was that that was the creator that we were talking about this morning the descriptor said he created all things by our in Jesus Christ all right it wasn't that he was standing here and he sent us on over here no he went itself part of God went out went over into a situation or whatever you want to call it how can you describe it cuz this girl folks and we were talking that a little bit let's want to go you know that back before man could talk just put it that way you know we'd be sitting around and and I'd let your brother dick not go mm-hmm that's it mm-hmm he said mm-hmm well I mean him knows what we're talking about we're gonna get some D right what if I said mmm and he said um hey that would make a language right you heard run around say they don't matter what it is he said even goo goo gah gah gah said it meant something somewhere in those languages the and it's like I've telling sister on Trudy back here the other day it'd probably be easier to describe in her language what I'm talking about if I knew how to talk her language me if I knew how to if we were all Greek than we talk in Greek we wouldn't be using the words and terms we're doing we would be using it into a form of greater higher capability luck sister Trudy she's sitting there in the hype of her mind translates what I said say in her language the other half of reminders translating it into English so she has got a problem run Colette's languages words are what we have developed to describe right yeah it wasn't that God sent down to Moses in the beginning said Moses tell him that's lame cuz that's not his name his name is Jesus so when they got ever had he said no no no no no no well show me what it is didn't Jesus say I come in my father's night did his father's name is Jesus he said well that's just Jesus only stuff why when I'm talking about Jesus I'm talking about Almighty God his name is Jesus that's why they couldn't pronounce it it was there was no vowels and whatever you do it in English vowels you know the words there was no I a TI o use to go in with it so the best i could do with with j vh v then some is jv8 you but it's basically veggie of exp there was no way to pronounce that so he came up with a way to pronounce it and they made it Jehovah see that was a way of man expressing what they saw would you know what I like in the scripture I told some jehovah witness is that one day acid I'm a better job witnessing you are listen how do you say hey I said called you over the over Jesus of the new when they naturally backed up a little bit my set aside why don't you quote my gave the scripture can't remember it now but the stretcher says by my name Jehovah was I never known now that stretcher that's what the Bible says he won because it was known as Jehovah it was Jesus will you this Jesus no I've not Jesus only that's the true revelation of the name of God his name is Jesus but see if we look at it with words we try to express ourself or the words you've heard the prophet say how many times where he'd say like in the English language the word board do what does it mean no board so you can have a blank on the floor come on board pay your board cuz im bored no well to all of those words are the same thing spell side but I've told you now if we get to understanding then the before and the after that's why I invite you to read your word read the Bible read the prophets message that's why I don't give you one line quote it's easy to good darting out one line and give it to you and that's what most preachers dead they just quote one line at least give you the whole paragraph it's in because it won't work but you see the before and after explains it I say come on board and stand on this board and pay your board good on board with you now you know exactly what I just say it so the before and the after explains you so the revelation explains it all right and many of us would ever thought the name of God being Jesus even the Jesus not only people wouldn't they didn't come up with that that has come up with it is Jesus only all right but now listen we don't believe in eternal son not just meaning the Catholic way but we showed this morning where the Prophet was talking about the low-cost a theophany now if that was a god himself in another form then you have sonship that would be counted in your eternal sunshine form but if that's God in another form call her son how did the man know in the Bible then with Nicodemus nobody knew it the man that looked down in and they put their three men in the fire and he looked down in there and there was four never can answer and he said he's locked into the Son of God then why didn't he say laughs at her son of man because of the land deals with you in flesh he looked in there and he saw something right somebody right he knew the way then three guys got took care of would buy that one other one man right so then if he loved her he said he's like unto the Son of God could happen he express it he knew he was God right we were talking a little bit of lunch about it see so get the idea this is what I was trying to bring and it was the last part to try to get more and then we'll go into more what we're talking about then God display in another form a part of God went out where I said you can't explain it he said but that's just what it was alright that part of God now listen that part of God that went out was eternal now you listening the part that went out of God was eternal but when we look at it we call it son one because he's displaying an attribute of himself to be able to hit let you and I comprehend him right he's displaying itself in a way we look at it say like I said the King would say it's got to be God who would look at myself I see it I'm not supposed to be able to see God if I'd say sup it's just some of God sister human ways of expressing when when I'm talking about low gosh theophany Son of God going out as being the one that created all things I'm doing exactly what I said this morning that God created all things by Jesus Christ are in Jesus crap so when he went over it didn't empty up here as Moses they took the spirit off of Moses put it on 70 he never made Moses no less God could give everybody in the world today the bad gives one the Holy Ghost seven billion people did make him no less you know what it might get make him greater would make him no less you don't cut it up and running on say like an apple give out the Apple you right out of pieces you around Apple know when he broke the bread you just kept coming back and he needed it you could put a ton after they did take up twelve baskets one time they made over I guess you decided give a little extra d on way home but now listen so sonship is a display of God in a way to help us understand right free women so it would mean a way of displaying it that we could comprehend it all right it doesn't mean the sonship is eternal seed I don't don't lock your mind on then the sonship is a display right the eternal God is what you really want to say it buddy he's eternal the Sun is a display of it it was an attribute ur apart scene now one day we get to an a minute on for more then one day that sucks you that we're looking at to help us to understand now you get me the part we're looking at the help us to understand not eternal God the part we're looking at to help us understand well one day have to be surrendered good you can't have eternal sons here to your own locked on eternal son ship like the Catholics you're looking at Jesus but random was back before the world using the quotes before the world did you talking about son ship he said anything got a beginning to have an env so whatever came out the form now not the god that was the form but whatever came out on that God that you can begin to understand by spiritual I that will one day the rope broke right back to where it was that's why Jesus said I come from God I go to God let around him said he went up now what did he say he said he come right back down in the pillar of fire to Moses on the road to Damascus he said the same one that went up come right back down with the different God it's not a different card you see there'll be a time come when we will no longer need to say here is that right there be a time come we will no longer need a healer true but will that do away with that no because we'll always remember him as either will always remember him as your Savior it won't do away so surrender doesn't mean when I get back to that in a minute see it doesn't mean that it is mean i rake my hand and I submit to whatever that other it don't like I said this morning when you when you were soldiers you raise your hand that means you're releasing whatever you was and you're going to submit to them I don't shoot you'll se suncook because you surrendered the you become their property the colonel illustrations but what else to say he watch it now as we get to it see then the attributes of God will go about and eat this plate and will return right back to where they came from goes before the world ever begun he had these attributes it won't be doing away with it hey there was a day as I said then I became a father you know that never done away with my wife called me husband now today we don't talk in those terms why because she don't say to me husband right why she my wife called me day I called him mama she's not my mother I'm not her daddy but what does it mean it means we together have produced a family and basically everybody calls me papi the grandkids has changed that name about four times from papo to pop in coming out and that pops in that if papi and pops and and everything else but you know everybody knows who i'm gonna be talking about but Steve that didn't change me from being hurt but we just don't sit down and talk about now boy in it nice being husband wife ain't nice meme husband one now we talk about ain't it nice being grandmother and granddaddy then and you know great-grandmother right when Daddy just moved up and that's carnal but that's the way God is see to her I'll always be a good husband to the children I'll always be their father to the grandchildren I'll always be there their grandfather and the great grandfather to do you know the great grandchild but each one will one day be incorporated right into our is broke right back into where it come from Jesus if i come from gonna go to God see I got to try to explain go what can we do the word son it means a beginning that's what it means son means a beginning an offspring but it means a beginning huh so as long as we're dealing with sonship and we will deal with sonship as long as this world exists on now we showed the other night about it when you go into the Millennium some things will be done away with but you know sometimes won't be done away with the win would go into the future home then it can all be in on now and with what I was trying to get through this morning but I want to talk about something to try to help us because we read here in the scripture in Corinthians the tables of kingdom that was a kingdom of God right now see here's where people get and it really irks me I've heard of in this message argue over whether it was a kingdom of god ur kingdom of heaven according to the Bible it taught both of them together and brought around them never distinguish between the two as being one of this way one of that way he will enter or release the quotes backward and forth of the scripture and so does the scripture has to be the son but there is arguments about that one is the kingdom of God the other one is the kingdom of heaven when we read here in the scripture that says that then come at the end when he who Jesus Christ to have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father huh now he's going to deliver that up so let's talk about a kingdom and we know that we're kingdoms come from the word like domain it can be used as the work throne we will try to enter relax both of them and all of it together in a few minutes Bedford it for you to understand but here in the end time there is a kingdom that is to be surrendered earth turn over what is that Kingdom now according to the Bible and according to the Prophet I gave it to you what to hold it uh-huh number one on your notes uniting one God one church 58 1221 the Holy Spirit is that Kingdom all right let's scan face through this cuz we're going to try to get through the earth all right the mark of the beast 1961 217 says you're born into the kingdom I'm quoting run around the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is dwelling in your heart the new birth all right now Jesus come to make away for the kingdom but remember this key the kingdom he was coming to make away far was not going to be his kingdom coasting might let you think it was to make the father's kingdom's right Jesus's kingdom and not the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus's kingdom as the millennial right we've got Luke it's goes in 90 minutes you got to come through so man to get her circles hold on me know what you see he had to die though it ended up saying this morning who he was he was what in body he was a man yes a create son but that's all and that spirit within that body would Almighty God right it wasn't that he was just a man and become a God later that would make him just like me and you I wouldn't make him all mighty glad to be able to die for us uh oh my god can't die forget it hey my god died at Calvary release the Holy Ghost to come out my god was able to take skimmed off of him an animal and they was mighty bloody in the garden you think you're God's not real maybe my god was so real he stripped of skimmed off the animals and give them died and Eve to where they were bloody I'll a bed rizzy Bible review profit you see it's what I said computer Kirk me just get a quote prepper I got 200 some quotes reckon order princess well if there's one contract good you are not until that one comes together i dont preach it till i see it now that's meant this has been this method i'm preaching on that what 40 years old my own folks I was tried and everything I could to get it to you and what God revealed to me many many many years ago not on did say revealed all of it I didn't say that there's thanks keeps unfolding amen then his unfold I come back and preach it again the unfold I press it again because i want you to see it what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother branham 576 Christ mr. God reveal it's the Word of God make spirit and life in your own life it's a new birth what is the kingdom of God it's the new birth Jesus Christ as I said dad to release that life that was within him the dead spirit could go back to God who gave it but the Holy Ghost Richard room the soul of God who could come back on the day of Pentecost into that kitchen when the Holy Ghost and give eternal life to to a person making the kingdom but that was your father's Kingdom John 14 in my father's house are many mansions that we're not sure I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you to go to prepare a place for your kind of receive you unto us that owns a token man a kingdom they've already eaten argued over where jesus said the kingdom is within well was it here was it dire as right where he said is in healing amen right there there wasn't anybody else and right now I ain t no pen the man's argued that the end of baptism of the Holy Ghost seals you questions and answers the fourth one line number 41 you know she owed you into the kingdom me Jesus spoke about a kingdom did he come to help prepare but then he's began to speak about a kingdom that they could not comprehend right they begin to talk about his own Kingdom that's right it was so great until a woman one day she said Jesus could ask you questions just one sit in your kingdom in my sunset one on one side won't ever see they some caught on that he were talking about when he called it a split condition or two things one being the kingdom of his father that he come to display because an adopted son is to display his father's Kingdom he's not to display himself like I've tried to get you to see it the word manifest what is it it's to me made known we only look at signs and wonders and do it and John the Baptist never done one side and made God known brother you don't live in signs of wonder you're crazy I've seen things and told you about the things I've seen in my life Colangelo upward so don't throw things that made it I don't believe in a manifestation of God then you don't be silly but I try not to be I try to be honest with you but you see Jesus begin to speak about a kingdom neither the disciples so we would understand that no and then they would fall back to the natural and they thought goes the way he was talking that it would sound like something so natural until after this resurrection in the book of Acts they said are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel them they thought of him having some form of a natural kingdom he will one day but it wouldn't have manifestation then he come to bring the father's Kingdom John Matthew three and two John came out preaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand Jesus in Matthew forward about 27 he preached the gospel of the kingdom I told her to stop was to go preach the kingdom of heaven was it hanging amen kingdom of God getting over heaven in which way he went to the go preach it like i said manifestation what did he do they made God known and God made them now Irish manifestation brother branham made God known and God made you know the signs and wonders because he couldn't do nothing by himself all right now you want to argue the point jesus said I do nothing till my father show you want to argue with the quotes where the prophet said it like this now give him to you the other day where Jesus didn't know about that woman when you come over and touched it he said be it unto you according to your faith he said because the father had not revealed that I'm quoting red around but said it the raloo term of laughter the father revealed him to go on and then come back the one of these days will understand reality see the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Luke 17 and 21 cities it is within you I said they argued about that below it was in him alright see it would come forth on the debt Pentecost the Romans 7 to 14 and 17 you'll find it the righteousness and the peace and things of the Holy Ghost was preached by the disciples my cuz they were making their father's Kingdom our father's house our fathers strong make manifest that's what Jesus come to do he didn't come to do his own he told piloting in John 18 and 36 he said if my kingdom was of this world now in the minute we're going to get down and see his kingdom in about this world but he wasn't doing it then his wrong time he said it my kingdom was here I would my disciples would fight right right see in my father's house john 14 he never spoke of his own when he get over the revelations 321 the red destroying that he says will sit with me in my throne as I have over come and sit with my father in his strong your throne was the baptism of the Holy Ghost his kingdom was a baptism with the Holy Ghost he all right he went to the Father's throne in the resurrection not yet he quotes that fort he's sitting now on the Father strong now listen to what I'm saying the literal body is sitting on the literal throne because that would be the father strong all right now I'm quoting rid of random all right but to baptism of the Holy Ghost they come back on a day of Pentecost is the father strung the new birth that's in your heart so he's setting in your heart by the new birth right but the literal body is not here corporal right knee read it now we got eaten number six on your note manifested manifestation of that resurrection read what the prophet said let's read the next one one of these I'd like to read but I'm trying to get time look at number seven on your notes well let's read number six why you turning night e 20 manifestation of that resurrection fifty forty eight or nine and he said I will return he's sitting on the Father strong tonight listen waiting to return to his own throne now worse David where's his throne yes David strong to rule and reign through the millennium now we've got to explain something right there Jesus has thrown is the Millennium the promise of the son David the David was promised that his son would sit on his throne Jesus Christ will sit on that throne he came and made way for the bat by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and yielding it up he gave made it come into being on the day of Pentecost the Father strong which is the baptism with the Holy Ghost everybody I'm saying number done around there's a quote in here I'll give it to you then he sit down through seven church ages he said it's been sent of God he said but one day you'll be summoned David but now here's the key we got to understand jesus never declared himself there is a quote run around gave on it but remember he's not contrary to all the other that he said no brother branham said there's no word Jesus ever declared himself to be the Son of God then there's one quote that he said these people say that Jesus say he'd said he witnessed Son of God said yes he did so now he's the one was they quoting to him you know what was he saying he was the son of God he was a son of man in manifestation the time would die right he never said he was the son of God he said who demands have a son of man am right the son of man had to die brother and said he died so on a

flesh right hey random would not be son of man with the bride of Jesus breath which bread rather that's a part of is the son of man come on because you can't go to the Millennium from some God how could you do it how could you go from Son of God to the Millennium dealers where it took me listening to take butter takes one day we would listening to him and back then I sometimes I had to turn that time with my fingers like that because we had enough battery in them to run the voice but it wasn't enough to pull a machine I've set there with my fingers and turned that machine and we listened to the to the unveiling of God for days in a row the last day I caught it see we deal with son of God son of man excuse me son of man sun god son of David you come in three sons night but get on the unveiling of God and see what he said he said son of man son of God for just a little time son of man then so dated you might listen to it right because you can't go from son of God to the millennial you got to get to the earth some way so he turned back to the in the end time it turns back to the son of man and the son of man can go to the millennium now listen the the promise let's go down and read and then we'll get to the point look at the next when errors of God's deliverance 50 60 80 1 he's home about that if he was Jesus that way yesterday he's got to be Jesus that way today if he's a sunny the only thing is different them and listen to it he hasn't got a corporal body now there's where people don't believe that little random said the only difference in the time of Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever is he don't have a corporal body well I just don't see what does that make it not right come on does that make it not right cause you don't see it the whole world don't see it listen no one thing is different he hasn't got corporal body his body is sitting on the throne of god that's not Jesus and strong he's sitting on tonight read the Bible said he said it on his father's from sea we hadn't got on the Book of Revelations all well he really we just still in the third chapter we ain't got to chapter four word yet okay is that right he did overcome she upset with me and on my throne as I've overcoming and set on my father's from now his stroll is on the earth and he's to be here with the people uranium 1958 3013 you know wouldn't even if you then if the only thing different in Jesus his corporal body sits at the hand right hand of God on the throne of god that's not Jesus is strong that's his father's from his from he's the heir fall after the he has David strong but he's at his father strong waiting he that overcomes yourself with me on my throne is over overcome and sitting my father's drunk he's waiting there in a corporal body God sending spirit back to be in the church come see son of man hello Jesus the strong ones don't have to start with a son of man and then they'll go the millennium and son undated okay identified Christ of all ages 19 64 66 17 and then when he died rose and the syndics it back the holy spirit that was the son of God God is a spirit and through the church age it's been son of God and then in the millennium and son of David sitting on the throne ruling he has ascended up he that overcomes you sit with me on my throne is I have overcome and set down on my father's from he sitting on the Father's throne now but in the Millennium it sets upon his own throne because he is the son of David son of man son of God son of David see it just perfectly you follow thee mighty God unveil 64 629 then we find after his death Berlin resurrection he came on to their Pentecost in the Son of God God the spirit and the form Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself make itself known making himself known to his people in a different form like to hold his spirit which is God he came to deal true that set to church ages the Son of God the Holy Spirit but in the Millennium he comes a son of David to sit on the throne of David King he wants to take the throne of David he's owned the Father's throne now then he said he that overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as I've overcome and said on my father strong during the Millennium he be son David what is it the same guard time just changing his mask all right one more this day the Scriptures fulfil 65 125 he came in three names he came in Son of Man which was the Prophet will what profit and that's what he did he proved his ministry but being a prophet we all know that there were one of us know he never said he was the son of God he said he was the son of man now today he is the son of God which you've returned back and now he's in the form of the Holy Spirit the unseen person but yet God the Son of God in the Millennium he sets on his Father's throne which he'll be Sunday he revealed himself first it's on a man a prophet this age through the church ages some in our trunk God and in the other age son of David three sons now watch it and you'll see what I'm talking about his kingdom was not set up on earth the father's kingdom was set up in the baptism of the Holy Ghost they come on a dip in ecology and through the church ages has been the son of God but a secret that none of the authors are writers show me one Joey one rider that had any common knowledge about it did Peter power any of them ever speak of son of man they didn't know that mystery you'll see all they knew he was so gone all they knew if you hold the old Jesus of the new but they didn't know the revelation and son of man neither did none of the scholar oh yes coalfield does a pretty good job of it but you see here come a little old man out need what did not window seals broke now starting to it when he come walking up their own land Ohio River it was just a little bit delete was talking about what as John the Baptist for run the first coming of Jesus Christ said your message will full run the second coming and he began to talk about the Son of Man and they couldn't comprehend that so God gave him two signs now what was those two signs me we call it taken by the hand and on a set another but what was he gave him two signs not only give you three don't don't brew women is just stay with me for a minute he gave him two two signs you know what those two signs were those two signs were the sign of the Messiah but a random head the sign of the Messiah because it was the Messiah son of me remember in every college chefs ungodly called herself son of man brother branham had the ministry of the son of man the unit's early ministry for the seals broke he was given two signs to show it then it went finally to the third son and what was it an opening to the word because his message never begun in 30 in 933 or 47 little message brother runs message begun in 63 when the seals broke now he says that not many he said not in the years of preparation but he said when he begins to sound his message go to do the rapture message and listen to it as I said this morning that was that split that he gave her in 322 of the seven I thanks 327 church age book where this messenger Malachi 4 is going to 2 times 1 turn the hearts of the children father's back to reveal the thunders you don't read in Malachi folder that this messenger is going to to is the only said you turned the hearts of the children right it doesn't say to reveal the seals the bread around them knew what he was doing he knew what it would take like see so the kingdom Jesus was walking himself with the kingdom inside of him right there was no way for anybody to get it called scripture said God had died because the Holy Ghost had not been given you know the kingdom could come into being it was inside of him when he died he released that which is the Father strong kingdom and he came under their Pentecost and bent down to seven Church ages now watch how close it's getting look how close it got dark in brother branham no wonder people call him God right good as the closest thing it's you'll ever see of God before the resurrection the challenge I say that hopefully don't bother me I wouldn't dare to watch it but I've heard a lot of people talk about and I've heard a lot what he said and you know it be hard to try to stay away from believing he was God when every time he turned around he just told you what you're thinking what was going on what's wrong way and everything else and even said it one day he said you're closer to it to call me Jesus Christ in the Artic only the Antichrist and it's pretty good quote but we know it wasn't God but God was coming back to getting ready to set up his own King delight and that son of man the Word made flesh was the kingdom he had and it's going to return in a bride whether you believe it or I believe it it's going on it's going to be we may not be part of it that may be why we doubt it sometime that's all right it will be who's God's going to show for just a little bit now that ain't gonna be no gimped in hospital tonight but I don't see why you couldn't go pray for all the people in the hospital there is no problem with that of you rugrats educated hospital trying to hospital pray for nobody now you you don't have the goods amen you had the goods you would mind go go ask my nephew when I had to double lung transplant go ask you me you tell you say on come and pray for me when I was in I spill and God delivered me and he lit up to me what 40-something years old which was beyond anything with his sister's fibrosis anybody de lejos de les you almost died one time in hospital is laying there underdogs you our Darwin the doctor told him whatever to baby just a few days old so don't buy no machinery don't buy nothing because he can't believe take him home right saucony jay bell but I tried to talk to him air in the hospital I couldn't get it right they wouldn't listen they got home the house right straight across will you come out from wage I went in the house and I picked up that baby and I took him out in the yard right cuz i knew i couldn't pray inside my head i asked god to touchy come on he touched it Amy we do it up I forgot how I look probably might have been on this 20 I don't remember exactly when that boy that'd be 15 18 years old he was real sick went to the hospital that brother be an outward he was our praying for somebody he said come on down here let's probably one end pray forever though he was Brad Martin I said come on down here pray with me from a nephew you know we went down and prayed for him he's under oxygen was supposed to live you know what he lived on all those years so I believe is real bad I believe God is real I don't believe me just a few doing my imagination understand all day and talk about this the things you say well we don't see nothing oh my gosh open your eyes like I said to that Catholic guy one day you know that man that worked he said I'm a Catholic Charlie and I said things probably 500 million he said you mean you're right they're all wrong I said I didn't say that but it's true he said why are you sick kind of wasn't that damaged Lucy network could I work when I see it ain't like nobody you know most everybody if they think you're gonna have a headache missed at home I never to do that I had to go to work had to make a living and you know I I didn't have anything to say to him but one thing I look back a demon green message you ain't dead yet you know the man was honest he said Sam I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that about you that he was not cemented but you see I believe in that healer hey I know who the son of god he is but i believe the brown is to be the son of man in the end time to edit that's what's your prophet said go on letting them God go to the money guard on valency today you don't believe it i'll give you the front of my Bible let you read them all the priestess 1969 the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man that's the first sermon ever preached in this message Sherman is a preacher but you see he was son of man that was a way of or what he was displaying now when he becomes son of god did that do away with son of mine that's the point I'm trying to get you see no but he put it in a position that it wasn't may be used or whatever call far are doing or going on but here in the end time it starts coming back amen Lee why because he's going to his strong and he's got to get on the throne of your heart in the new birth the adoptions the things you've got to be in our heart me and I don't change the probably never talked about a change of dispensation from Son of God the Son of Man come on that's what people try to make it because he's still son of God just like he was when he was here on the shores of Galilee he was the son of God God manifested in flash try the Sun but in a ministry that was a son of man to be showing he was the god of the Prophet come on brother let's see down to the agency's been some of God then for a little while now it's beginning to turn back but that don't do away you know what does anybody take it saves you got to be so gone right see if I want to do away with something when we go to the when you go to the Jews and we leave out of here what's he going to be sunday view drive but you know he's got to go to them and Son of God to give them a baptism of the Holy Ghost then they'll see he's some of man and then they'll realize that he saw David so he's going to be son of David in the tribulation to the Jews but he won't be sitting on an earthly throne because it'll be two prophets in the tribulation you see how close it was from brother branham there was one prophet displaying this on a man maybe two prophets displaying this on a man for just a short period and when it does and it will go right on over the end of the millennium now what's going to happen it in now it's where the prophet comes into view with the scripture we read so let's read that scripture again now all right great things then come at the end all right when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God who's that the Sun but that Sun is eternal life it's not as soon as we make it we're making words delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power now he drops back he's up dar showing its all power or authority all room you know that jesus never said that he that all power is given unto me I until after his resurrection ricci powerful it was after his resurrection when he said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth because you better remember something I know I could say four hours more on you better remember that son of man is ruler of the earth so God is root of all things you better get the quote to the Prophet so David is just a millennium rain so god is ruler of all aims see if I'm right right your computer find out is right now we don't you turn something going to happen all right then come at the end when he shall delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall I put that all rule and all authority in all power no there's one time that has not been destroyed yet and that's what he's talking about here hey Ben now in Jesus Christ all things was conquered right death everything was conquered but it's not into manifestation yet right cuz we're still here we're still getting older so listen for a much rain d who Christ Jesus Christ the Son of God all of these kingdoms were talking about all the things he must reign till he hath put all the enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed his death words death destroyed it according to my understanding what the Prophet said is destroyed after the Millenium and two white throne judgment death is still taking its toll in the Millennium now there's nobody dying don't go quote me wrong nobody dies in the Millennium no but after the Millennium death will rain into the white throne judgment and death and I always both destroyed what last enemy that shall be destroyed his death for he had to put all things under him that's under him so don't wear out God has put it all under this runs here you're giving him all power all authority that's what he said when he raised all power and Helen earth red red said you Trinitarian said tell me where the father had any power left right because the Bible said I'll let him forget but all things under his feet God put it under Jesus Christ but when he said all things are put under him it is manifested he is accepted don't try to look that word up Webster coated ain't even though oh you can't find it Webster's dictionary find it better exc ep 28 ed it's a secret to their we did put all things under him and when all things shall be too subdued unto him in other words when everything and death hell everything it's a dude then shall the Sun all throw himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be old and all is what I said I wrote these in my Bible right here I don't know 30 40 years ago I don't think really though I read them to you but listen to him one more time Chrysler mr. God reveal 1963 728 number 13 on you notes you might ought to read it and God at that day the kingdom be given over to the father he might be all in all well he's yet speaking out here days of Christ David sitting on the throne now where's that at millennium listen the king over the whole human race what do you speak of I know what they're thinking minds you let's draw like a bullet worth of that millennium right okay the sea it's not all done in the Millennium goes deaths not destroyed the millennia destroyed after mine it's destroyed for a spiritual by the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you and I yes but death and hell and all it's done after which is white throne judgment i'm glad i found this other one future home 1964 802 city with the throne in top now what's he told that they said in here revelation 21 23 so that's not the millennium millennium is 19 and riding in becoming and they need no life for the lamb and the Lord God is a lot birth the lord god is that pillar of fire that followed the children of israel through the wilderness he is ascended upon the throne in that perfect kingdom when the the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God may be all in all Jesus sits on his throne here is our Joseph no sorry the bottom was cut off in a printing back door but I wrote it on the bottom of mine then the king is the light is that light that on top of Mount Zion and holy holy light will flood the entire city he's in that Alou you so make the call it all over to the future home oh no the future do you see what's happening the sonship will be surrendered I used to work use the word of terminate in no way that I ever mean terminate that's terminate like doing away with I explained it I didn't have that education I don't have it now but the scripture says that is you'll give up the kingdom the Prophet city of surrender the kingdom what's happening he there's going to come a time that God may be all in all the Millennium will be the first part of it and Jesus was set on his strong as son of David in the millennium and you and I will sit on that throne with him too sure that I gave you a couple of quotes down through that now they don't need no light of the scripture says the future home he said they don't they need no lot for the lamb is the light so the lamb is in the future home he won't say the lamb is in the future home so it's certainly not done away like tore up and burn up or left off and don't need it in the lower the lamb is the light in the future home what your profits is what your Bible says so don't put do away we'd like to do away with it say brother Dale done away with son few know what when it all comes back and makes that perfect circle not brother Dean rapture in a circle he comes all the way back because that's what he was preaching on years ago when it's all finished jesus said I come from God and I go to God he made a complete circle there had done a wonderful job there the other night he was talking about infinity and you know and they lay an eight you know it's not not an eight now to make two circles it's an eight where the lines go like this it's not two circles a that you talk about infinity it's it's this I'm going to told Aaron later I said if you just pull that apart and you know what you got you just pull it apart like that and you guys like this you pull it apart you got a perfect circle but that's not the point because of circles you're not getting nowhere right you're just going around and around that's our mind but infinity is made by the Sun you know what it means it means it's traveling you know what it means it's come close to crossing itself again it just didn't do it did you catch that point you stretch it out let's a circle but if you keep it in it like that that means travel circle you just going round round man go get no word if you doing like to that you getting somewhere you saw you're just going out away you don't get the point man looked down there one day in a vision and he saw wiggle in the middle of the wheels and this we were run by this and this running like that and brian says why DC he says how the children visual travel going down through the wilderness me you're not listening see the lamb is the light thereof that's revelations 21-23 sneak him in the future home and the city had no need of the Sun leader of the moon to shine in it for the glory of the Lord did lighten it the glory of the Lord and the lamb is the light thereof you remember I made the statement and so we're not going up to heaven and we're going to see a pillar of fire over here we're going to see a high level over here and we're going to see of Jesus over here now that's what the Trinity concept is me we're going to see Jesus when he said on earth he said if you seen the father you see me you've seen the father when we get dire web seeing the rents it when you raise that nail prints don't you think you'll still be that one because you're going to do what if sonship I'm not doing away with the thing if you're catching on what I'm saying if the lamb is the light then the lamb is in the future home but he's in tires a lamb running around no one of these days we'll find out what that lamb is and we'll find out that lamb that seven horns and seven eyes and that lamb come from the church ages including Britain but you see never did I have reference to what you're thinking then out référencement I made to hit your references you're not going to see three names I never I don't believe that we're going to see Jesus what's the problem with the line it says in Revelation 21 23 the glory of the Lord did lighten it let's just ignore the Lord lighten the city and it except in the lambeth alike they're up to have it is like the glory of this you know of God did the light of the lamb will see Jesus and know who he is the mysteries will be gone let's see I like this one there is one more to add door that it says that you know you know I've tried to preach to you have it when it over with that there be a message your cheer look up to top of the page number 15 on your notes which is one page one away to the church age book and now to these sons of God who buy him over come are given the privilege on the paradise of God in the constant fellowship of Jesus Christ there will never more be any separation from him whether he goes his bride will go what he is he shares with his glove on a joint our relationship the secret things will be revealed remember Deuteronomy 2929 secret things belonging to god but those things that are revealed belonging to you and me is that what it said this will be like him for we shall see him as he is but you see I do a lot of checking to make sure that when I say something that it all run across something don't crouch and you come up with it so look at the last one down there number 18 questions and answers and 1964 823 and he's explaining the glory and loosened the things has happened and always burn up not volcanic ash burned everything and I saw a new heavens and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea I John saw the holy city descended from God out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband remember it and in this bride behold the tabernacle of God is with men and God shall dwell with them upon this pyramid-shaped CD 1500 we're miles and in the top of the city there will be a lot Amy now now look what he describes let's continue reading on top of Mount Zion will set the lamb and the city will note how no need the city will need no light for the lamb is the light thereof listen and above the lamb will be the father which is a low-cost God the great light the eternal light that has shined just above the throne and Jesus will not be on his father strong I never caught his ties to the future home what's it and Jesus will not be on his father strong he'll be on his drum work in the future home that's what your prof is read he'll be on with you strong and the father will hover over the Sun all in this trinitarianism now read the next few words which the father and the son will be one will be one farther in the Sun will be one cuz he's always been one amen we get dire it's not going to be that we're going to get there and God the Father is not right us nothing mountain so he's just so spirit float now that you hundred and we're going to all do this and then the other no no no the throne that he's on in the Millennium will continue right into the future home and it'll be in strong and then he's right you've seen me you've seen the father the lamb is the light so worth lamb the glory of the lord is divert the words not left is any problem we see it him standing there and maybe even let it make it a little bit to where we're at maybe when we stand there and see him you know they might be a lot laying over his shoulder you remember that the light that was over brother branham that took a picture wouldn't a great big halo in a great big circle up above human and looking like the Catholics try to draw it out and go all this stuff going on you know the one they took the picture of this hanging in Washington DC was a white looking light hanging over his shoulder will be no problem with Jesus standing there with that laying on his shoulder neither would it be any problem with the lamb being there because you and I are going to be that lamp tell that's where the lamb comes from great day for hoops come on let's hang this a little bit messy at home but state and have his ways and sunder whether we want to get home hey careful because don't take no change in weather it's why we do these things while we have our services close together where everybody can get home but think about him the lamb is the light of the city you know that lie to be just as great over you as it is over him if it took a picture over brother branham why wouldn't it be a picture be able to take it hanging over you and I let's stand together what would be the problem see if we did do away with anything did we we proved by the Bible of prophets message that even a lamb will even still be there then done wavelength time for the green we just let everything manifest itself and there's a time we don't need a healer but you'll still be there time we don't need a savior when you're still no attribute will be done away with that's one God Edra are under inhale if I have an econ related we be come I will be a little buddy's been hurtin I home legislation everything will refund they are
