way they need to go while they're young I like being down here close I can get in your throat let me back up just a minute I'll be fine no I'm not going to I may try to get up on it if you have your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Romans 8 like Dy say we had a good time to just uh past week fellowshipping and and uh just watching the wonders of God and seeing all the great things that that he's given us I was sitting on the stand you know and I said Lord we don't see a thing thanks for letting us come amen amen cuz you know what at the end of the week the Old Devil says well you had all them people praying for you to get a deer and you got nothing nothing I said devil just to breathe I've got you whipped I said you're going to have an End Amen I'm not right and he leaves for a little while but he comes right back right oh yeah Book of Romans 8 verse 18 I know you've you've heard all the announcements this morning everybody was here we not go through all those but just in this time of of uh Christmas let's all just be attentative to each other and give the greatest gift which is eternal life amen not a gift that was wrapped up the greatest WRA gift was the one that came on that Christmas morning that's right wrapped in a veil of Flesh amen and now coming back through you and I into another veil of Flesh the word made flesh Romans 8:18 let's pray dear heavenly father today Lord truly is the day of salvation and we pray Lord that you would just take what's being said here Lord and break it to the people Lord may they understand Lord that you're the only one that can reveal we can only open your ey their eyes Lord just so they can see you father and not see us as a human being Lord but to see you and to glory in your salvation Lord glory in your word and the things that you've done for us we pray that you'd be with the sanctuary here Lord just Bless the people you said you sent the word and healed them and delivered them from destruction I pray now that you would touch each one father just be with the ones on the Foreign Fields just be with them Lord bless them give us today our daily bread Lord forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes in Jesus name we ask these things amen we kind of spoke on a little thought we out in Oklahoma we went over the uh permissive will perfect will and then Dad and I got us talking about a few things and and um this still may be part of chosen in him but it may be a little different angle Romans 88: 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature or the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God in other words for the authority to come back right for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly in other words the creat didn't have anything to do with this fall Adam sure he was part of it but we're talking there this creation is talking the outside world because it's groaning waiting because he's Paul's going to bring it into us though right for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature or creation itself also shall be delivered in other words he's saying that when these manifested Sons start to begin to show their on the earth that the creation outside right that's what they're looking for right that's why every every animal that's dead on the side of the road that's why every tree that's leaning that's why every flower that's dying it's looking at me and you amen right because I believe in the fall when when when the fall happened and Adam sold out the human race he sold out the Earth too remember cuz he gave that title back and then now as the lion began to used to go up to Adam and and and was soothing and petting and all that brother boy then all of a sudden the lion looked at Adam a little different angle well in other words he's looking at Adam and saying you did this bring us back yeah because you look and see what in the Millennium and in the future home you see it back in order that's right lying laying with the lamb doing everything that happened in the Garden of Eden before the fall right because the creature itself also shall be delivered what when we're delivered we got to be delivered first then the Earth comes later from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know Paul's telling us that we know that the whole creation granth and prevaileth in pain together until now and not only they see Paul saying not only they out there but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the ad adoption to Wi or to witness or to understand the Redemption of our body you may be seated in the Lord as His blessings reading the word I think we cut the air conditioner off up here it's actually 70° in here okay so we're going to cool it down just a second if you need anything to wrap up with that's why we brought these and we got a moon and you need some light these things put off a lot of heat but in Roman 8 the word manifest means to make known now to make known who to make known you or to make known God all right that's where we're getting off the line we going to make known God or we're going to make known ourselves cuz if you make known God God's going to make us known right everybody wait amen all right what are we going to manifest are we going to manifest great signs and wonders we could yeah but do we have to I thought our commission in this end time was to fulfill the word for your day right right and your hour we don't need to build an ark we don't need to to go and and and deliver a group of people out of Egypt we are going to have to move put it right there maybe I won't go over that way I do I'll fall you loud but fulfill the word for your day so we don't have these things even listen now even I get to it in just a second even in the book of Acts sure another book of Acts is being written but it's not the same one we're not Paul right we're not Peter we're Dean Gibby Terence Dale right we're in this time right they were then not taking anything away from them but like I was telling them out in Oklahoma Paul was standing looking in he Hebrews 11 and all those great warriors of faith and he said they he's pointing they without us right will never get out of the ground but Paul was prophesying of a group of people that's going to be over here in the end time looking back at Paul and those people and saying they right without us amen cannot be made perfect all right so it's not that it's not that that Paul's saying hey you know I'm perfect we're perfecting all those people no he was perfecting to a place his time right sure then in our time we have to see that all that that which is perfect has come that which is in part is not going to be done away it's not that we don't need them anymore they need us right and like Daddy said this morning I didn't write the Bible this way this is the way he wrote it that's right he wants us to be here if you believe in predestination you'll believe that that you're sitting right exactly where you're supposed to be in the end time right so let's like I told him in in Oklahoma I said let's quit being babies right let's quit having to explain the milk I like milk but when I go to a steakhouse when I go to Murphy's I don't want milk I want a big old sir about that big they give you a 24 o sirloin and they cut it in half and you can split it with your partner who's there with you dick I might want a glass of milk with it but I don't want just a glass of milk and I don't want to go back and start eating baby food we need to grow up and see like Daddy was saying today he's he's bringing us to a point because predestination is by for knowledge but we got to believe like I told them that there is a predestinated right there spot right yeah right that we got to come to right now you you determine whether you get there or not but God's going to have this spot right here right amen all the people that are dead can't attain to that but all which are alive and remain that's what the scripture said are going to make this point so this point is predestinated eternally from God can't come any other way will not come any other way now you and I must decide and he knew who would be at that spot right but we got to grow up and believe that there is a predestinated line a shoot you say well he didn't pull me through a tube no but he owns the tube yeah and if he wants to pull me through it he can but that brother Brandon was making that uh that U point because like with this thing right here I can do more by pulling it but if you push it you can't you can't do a lot pushing a chain but you can pull it right God's pulling us towards something it's just you and I have to connect to it Hallelujah okay he's going to pull the chain whether I grab a hold of it or not right all right so now let's grab a hold of it with faith let's grab a hold of it those people did in the Old Testament right up to Paul Paul did right on up to here somebody held on to it and attain to their age not even in my note we'll be okay but in end time br's got to identify herself different right than anybody else amen right we're done there's nobody else to go and hand it to except the Jews and they will receive two prophets right that are predestinated in the scripture they will come now identified here no other age will see a Redemption of a body except this age all right all other ages are gone right no other AIDS will come to full manifestation now we've got that's what I was trying to get them to see in Oklahoma now we've got to go and focus paab binoculars you can get a wide angle but if you want to focus in and see what uh what size that deer is that's fine but you can if you got a real good set of binoculars you can go up to those horns and you can count the points you can go on a little bit further and you can see the little bitty points why you're focusing in more right we got to focus in to get out of here amen Paul said I run this race and I'm going to run it and he knew what he was going to attain to a crown of life would be given to him but he knew that he would not take a body chain that's you and I that's our promise amen signs Glory the devil will have them wonders the devil will have them that's right false anointed one ones will be everywhere but our promise is that we will be changed in the moment in twinking of an eye all right full manifestation what do we think is it going to be a walking superum super hero you know and that we zap this person and zap this person and no what happened to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration he was transfigured yeah he had witnessed is there but now was there a sign or a wonder they come down off the mountain and Jesus said tell this Vision to No One In other words don't go out and give there won't be a sign or a Wonder to this that's right right except one thing and that's the son of man will be risen again Amen in other words it's going to happen to a group of people over here when Elijah comes all right we'll get to it in just a second it does not mean that if we do have signs we're going to be right and we don't have signs we're going to be wrong right right the prophet said having a wonderful day does not mean you're saved that's having a cloudy day does not mean you're lost right right what's our promise believe have faith to believe what's going on sign Seekers they'll get what they want that's right sign Seekers will get I said sign Seekers people that go looking for signs will get exactly what they want we'll read a scripture on that later but look what happened in the Bible Israel come out a Mak multitude come out they had some of the greatest signs and wonders of all times they took a nation like the United States of America and destroyed it right absolutely abolutely destroyed it and the mixed multitude and the other 99% of the Israelites never made it to their promise that's right only Joshua and Caleb of that original group that saw what happened those that are 20 years old they weren't even born when they come out of is Egypt so they wasn't under the great sign sure they come up through with the Mana what about being fed every day we'd be bigger than we are now if it was given to us what about all those things I want you to get a mind you know something in your mind they came out under signs and wonders and actually disregarded it oh yeah they said we loathe this bread right we don't have any water to drink where's our water God give them all the clothes to wear they never wore out for 40 years see what people are yeah right and I know they're unregenerated people but they're a type of you and I for today right I think I'll stay down here more this is better what you say amen amen thank you maybe we get more amens on tap I hear these other preachers you know on the internet and stuff you pull on they got one we may need to get a little microphone well maybe we don't oh me shut up but no I like to hear amen's on the tape you know sometimes you hear Daddy on the internet we were gone you know at Thanksgiving and and uh we were at jun's Mom and Dad's and I had heard all their cussing and drinking and smoking all I wanted so Sunday morning I hit the internet Daddy was screaming just as soon as I cut the thing on and they said cut that down I said forget it I listen to y'all all weekend you going to listen to this buddy they scattered out of the house but thank God for the internet that we can do that yes but sometimes he was preaching along and you didn't hear the word no amen every once in a while you hear dick say something you know amen I like to hear a congregation that rolls amen amen just kind of gets you in the gets you in the mood I guess but whether you amen or not if it's the truth it's the truth but Israel comes in with a mixed multitude where did they fail did they fail in believing the signs and wonders was that what the whole thing was about what was the whole thing about a Promised Land that's the whole thing the whole thing that that God took them and pulled them out of is out of Egypt for for one purpose that was to put them in a Promised Land not to show signs and wonders he had to show them to try to get the people to believe disregarded they didn't do it didn't do a bit of good the same two went over that you know that went over had they probably not been any sign cuz there's only two people Joshua didn't come up to kades Baria and say well we've had a lot of signs I believe no he said God said it Caleb said God told us he weren't run through the crowd and he said shut up shut up you read the Bible didn't he he steal the people be quiet listen to Joshua listen to the Holy Ghost that's our type today right and we're a type of the of Caleb the end time believer now the they had the hand of God every day every day but they were given a word test and they failed it yeah right right right given the word test they failed it did not matter and God even kept on giving signs and wonders sure right cuz we're going to get to where the signs and wonders will deceive even the very length if it were possible the signs Seekers but the Joshua and Caleb group they manifested the word for their day that's right am that put them in the word of God Amen that put them in the predestinated group of people right they took the word and held it you hear the prophet you know you see the Bible said they took the word so did so did Joshua and Caleb whose word did they take huh Moses huh the end time leader for the day for their time you know their time their leader Joshua didn't have a Bible to run to or a quote book right no he believed what his messenger said even when the messenger went off the scene he took that message and took it right across the promised land amen right and he wasn't preaching that the messenger was going to Moses going to come back the Bible says Moses thy servant is dead that's what he told Joshua Joshua 1 Moses thy servant is dead you're going to take the same thing forward am but now listen how did they get in the promised land signs and wonders oh yeah the Jordan River open opened up but what I'm saying is did they go into the promised land and go Canaanites go this way am malachit you go this way no they fought for every piece of ground they took they had to fight for it amen that's my whole point sure there was there was signs and wonders among them when they got in the promised land because Joshua come to a place that he needed more sunlight he said Son stand still but you know what he still he didn't sit down and go okay God fight the battle no he said God I need some time so that I can fight the battle right am I getting somewhere signs will be among the Believers in what you need for the time right right you call on signs and wonders and you may call the devil that's you call on look because that's what a lot baam right think of bam he wanted something so but God said no then finally he said go on but it still worked for the perfect will of God that's right always will right right but they got into promised land they still had to physically fight God was leading them I've been going back through the Old Testament and reading even David and some of those uh Old Testament Warriors they had to fight but they had God among them amen right God didn't leave them what did they have they they found the will of God the mind of God David would go and and say God what about today what about the Battle God will say wait for the going of the mulberry bush yeah and why'd he say that he said David wait for the going of the mberry Bush he said because the battle is yours amen amen right because the battle is yours God leading but God not doing it for us right something you and I have to do amen amen all right we'll get to something here and the only time they lost the battle was when when aen done something outside the word of God that's right amen he took a garment and he took a wedge of gold now what is the definition of religion garment or covering right the definition of religion is a covering that's what brother R said Adam and Eve was doing in the garden they put on fig leaves went back in bushes and had church right they covered up what they thought was wrong amen right all right so now achen takes a garment and takes a wedge aen brought something in the congregation of God that was not of God God told him he said destroy them don't bring anything in here you know how all those people Saul all those people got in trouble for not obeying the word of God right you stay inside the word of God you know he even told Solomon he told Solomon he said Solomon as long as you lead my people in my ways I'll bless you right and he did until he got older right and then when he started sacrificing the idols God went away from him and he died all right now aen brought something in that was not supposed to be there right a a garment and a wedge what is a garment he brought another Doctrine or another idea into the camp and then the wedge is a division right what do you do with the wedge yeah with a wedge you separate you divide amen he brought a false doctrine that divided the people and people died amen right right now where did he hide it he hid it in his tent that's right in the Earth right oh my a't that's what the Bible said it was understand his tent it was under his blankets in buried in the earth oh my you get out of the word and you see what happens right cuz we don't live in natural tents anymore the Bible says you are a temple of the Holy Ghost you're the tent that God lives in that's right maybe the reason that we don't have these adoptions and these wonderful things that we think we ought to have maybe we got a few things hid in our tents that we need to get rid of right right because something's going to have to happen to break this chain of still being here oh yeah every time I see somebody like brother beam and some of the older ones you know not him him having a wreck right but some of the others dying off I think God the chains got to be broke somewhere that's right like Daddy was getting to this morning some somewhere has got to be broke somewhere you know that we've got to come to and the only thing I can see is the prophet said one time that full obedience brings us to adoption right he didn't say part he said full obedience right right now I was thinking today because daddy said something you you know about the change of the body and everybody amen that was the biggest amen he got of the whole sermon but some of those amens that you hear are is that coming from a life that's lived come on it's not just that you're going to come to a place that spot's just not right there and you're going to go right you got it's got to be here amen right we can say Amen about a body change all we want to but unless we live in the economy of God unless we don't unless we get rid of all the wedges and we get rid of all the garments come on because remember the character of those Israelites were built in battle because the worst thing God and I'm sorry the worst thing God done was was feed them by hand right he babied them the worst thing he done was handed out stuff to him and he knows that right is that the worst thing for you and I amen I think about my kids you know Josh is here Hanna's not you try not to let them get so far in a hole oh my but sometimes it's good to let them get in a hole and dig their way out amen thank you Jesus cuz you know what it builds character than because I'm getting to something we all want Power everybody wants great signs and wonders everybody wants power the prophet said power right apart from character it's satanic but now wait power is not bad right right fitted with character he said fit to rule that's what we come into fit to rule this is fit to rule this point I'm pointing to this point is fit to rule that's what we're coming to character is built in battles not signs and wonders signs and wonders gets your faith built up but what if it's a false sign oh what if it's a false wonder the Bible says we're going to read it lying wonders that's right lying wonders that's not of God that happened then it happened now that's right but remember this is not for this is not for mixed multitude this is for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen right because they will have whatever they want brother R said they had carnal impersonator somebody go out and impersonate the gift we were listening to it coming coming home Friday you know they were all in the hand and you'll read on spok Words Original Seed he said you know all fires Balls of Fire on the pulpit he never said that they were right he said they had all those carnal impersonators right amen right but when he comes down to the word that's what we're looking at because the mixed multitude couldn't handle what God even what God was given them the mix multitude is the one that murmured Dayan Kora Bible says you know they they The Gangs saying of Kora now what did cor do what' cor do cor said Moses you take too much on yourself oh yeah let us set up right a place over here what he wanted to divide that's right right but the great divider God said Moses you stand in one place and you tell them people make a choice you either come over here or you stay over there right and ones that stayed over there they're still down in the earth somewhere right but let's turn to Matthew 12 Jesus spoke of worship more than he spoke of signs amen let me say that one more time had to do this in Oklahoma cuz they were they didn't amen cuz I I was preaching where daddy you know would come to the place where Jesus didn't bring us an inheritance he he come to get us back to the inheritance boy they were they did that kind of that kind of puts a kink in your armor every once in a while when people look at you but the prophet said it right amen Jesus didn't come to bring us an inheritance he come to bring us a way he said I am the way back to that inheritance so I said it about three times and I said okay I'm going to read what the prophet said you won't believe me I'll just read the quote Matthew 12 they got it probably had more compliments on that sermon I guess than any other we know where all blessings come from Matthew 12 38 Jesus speaks of one sign certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered and said Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign now hold on to your pants leg because Believers have signs right okay we I'm just we're looking at sign Seekers come on cuz that's just what he says in a spir an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign they go in other words they go looking for it digging through the bushes digging through the word trying to build things up with with fast music or or a loud singing or or you know or a bead or something that's not it and there shall be no sign there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth then it talks about the men of Nineveh and then the queen of the South cuz he said greater than a Jonas is here and greater than a Solomon is here right cuz he was standing there telling them the son of man have to be three days we understand why that how that happened that that he was only in the heart of the earth two days and then now he's he come out of the come out of the church ages in where in Matthew 17 where he said Son of Man be risen again that's what's happening now Matthew 16:4 let's read that pretty much the same thing but he they ask him again I guess they didn't understand him the first time then the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show him a sign from heaven did they just want to see a sign a couple of scriptures ago now they want to see a sign from Heaven Jesus said when it is evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you but can you not discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it now brother random said I don't have the quote I didn't bring any quotes with me today I just brought scripture brother random said that that was not their generation it was this generation right now anybody with one eye and a half sense ought to know an adult a wicked and adulterous generation is this generation Jesus was not speaking of the Pharisees and the Sadducees generation he was speaking of this day I got the quote back there I just didn't bring it I pulled it up but brother random said they were he was speaking of now right a sodomite condition yes all right so he wasn't speaking of then he's speaking of now so now bring it to right here right a wicked and adulter generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it what that generation but the sign of the Prophet Jonas amen and the brother Rand said the sign of the Prophet Jonas was the resurrection we got a resurrection sign the prophet bringing the word of God to us and signs and wonders come coming from the prophet showing us that he had risen amen all right so one sign in Matthew 17:9 he just keeps going just go straight over to 17:9 he said they came down from the mountain and Jesus charged him saying tell this Vision tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead now that wasn't the first time that was this time end time right amen everybody understand that cuz he said El lias truly shall first come and restore all things John did not restore all things John introduced the Messiah right exactly all right this Prophet this Elijah is to do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and reveal the Thunders and and the seals coming up through there all right so Jesus was talking about a future event right future event aive truly shall first come amen and restore all things right now the son of man being revealed or raised again in the end time so that's today right that's the sign that's given right a there's no other sign because brother randam said there would be the same as the Bible says there would be signs and wonders given passed out to everyone how you going to tell the difference right right but watch this now we know that Jesus walked to the pool of Bethesda one day and he says I do nothing except the father shows me first right right everybody's looking for the sign will he healed one man yeah and we know in the Scriptures it says in the Book of John that that the many miracles that Jesus did could could not be contained in this book but why didn't they put it in this book why didn't they put in this book cuz we shouldn't need that that's right Gentiles should not need that do you not read in the scripture where Jesus turns to the guy and says the guy says I got a kid that's sick or a servant that's sick what' he say the man say speak the word hallelujah right what kind of sign is that right speak the word John the didn't have one sign or wonder but he identified himself in the word amen now they didn't somebody preach that John was one crying in the wilderness this is where we going to get down to home yeah John did not preach I mean somebody didn't preach John was one John said right that's right John said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness in other words he opened the scroll up one day and he identified hisself come on Amen in the word amen that's it he did not have a healing campaign he knew he was going to introduce that Messiah that's right Glory right was John killed for doing any Miracles John was killed for walking up and taking care of a marriage and divorce situation that's right right Jesus was not killed for his healing campaign right he was killed when he said I right personal and my father are one Hallelujah you are of your father the devil and his things you'll do Hallelujah he's identified himself in the word amen amen come on living who they they were brought them the trouble that's right not signs and wonders right living who they were think about that right living who they were brought the trouble upon them right amen amen wow it hits home doesn't it amen but after Matthew 17 I believe Jesus did one miracle that was recorded he may have done more but what did he do after Matthew 17 if you have a scull fill Bible sometimes just flip through it he preached go and look in the Book of Luke in Luke 9 no ma Mark 9 and Luke 9 and even in John you'll find you'll see John doesn't speak of the mount Transfiguration but you can see the timeline after in John I like the Book of John in the Book of John it's about in like the fifth or sixth chapter and then Jesus starts doing what he starts preaching the gospel right you got the great John 14 that was after Mount Transfiguration he preached the word amen and let the word back itself up right Glory he identified himself in the scriptures come on right now I want to ask you a question does coming to adoption bring glorious signs in wonders or does the preaching of the word amen bring you to adoption you tell me amen no no way no don't get me wrong I'm not throwing them out right I'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water but I'm saying this is sign Seekers we're still on this side we ain't got to to to the signs following the Believers we're looking at at people that want to believe by following signs but look Paul he did a lot of Miracles but he did a lot of preaching right he wrote 80% of the New Testament right you can count him on your hand almost the Miracles that he wrote I'm saying that he wrote cuz we cannot take hearsay amen as a gospel right amen do you understand I know Jesus Christ every day did Miracles don't you know don't I'm not stupid but this is only the recording that has to be a part of me I have to identify myself in this word right that's what brother Ram said about the book of mccabes and all he said sounds good right some of it may be true he said some of it is not so we can't take that as gospel we have to take this as gospel that's right okay so if they did great signs and wonders which I believe they did I want to see the recording come on amen this is what's going to help me right some other people may have a good good good uh Doctrine out there a good view or a good idea or a concept right but brother random was Vindicated amen I want to hear a Vindicated person amen I believe we got one here amen absolutely bless you but Paul was a patter Messenger right nice right let me ask you a question when brother Brandon was doing research he come to irenius and polycarp right now they both had signs and wonders right he said they were real close right what separated them amen more signs and wonders did did did did uh irus do more signs than polyart no no he come down to one thing he went right back to Paul Paul said come out of her my people right irenius said come out of her my people it was the word that separated irenius from polycarp as being the the the church age mess so not signs and wonders it was what the word said about him all right what they said about the word I'm sorry what they said about the word the message irenius had set him apart not the signs and wonders right the message he had right then signs and wonders followed that message all right and we're going to get to that we're getting we're getting there actually we're about done you're doing bless Luther had signs sure but he had a message that just shall live by faith right Luther really wasn't known for his signs and wonders as far as outwardly he was known for coming out of the Catholic church and just live by faith right okay now excuse me Pentecost you say what what are we going to do with this don't worry if I got it wrote down I got an answer Pentecost came to do what brother Harris restore the gifts which includes signs and wonders but not just signs and wonders exactly they brought the Holy Ghost back into power right among the people amen then that brought the signs and the Wonders amen that's what we got to do Glory we got to bring the Holy Ghost Among Us in power if we try to do this ourself we're going to mess it up brother Ram said you go out beyond your time he said that's why there's scrap heaps of ministers laying on the on the side of the road but why did he say they were laying on the side of the road they went out past God's plan tried to make something happen and had a wreck out of the will of God oh so do you want to try to make something happen now now listen Paul even when Paul was in jail he was doing something right he wrote most of the Bible sitting in jail right but he was doing something he was under house arrest he wasn't basically in jail but he was he couldn't go anywhere without an escort and just so happen that escort could write so as he would say something the escort would write it now so God used the whole plan but now Pentecost came and restored the gifts then the signs and wonders followed them right right right amen always the signs follow the believer let's turn to First Corinthians and we'll be finished in just a second the reason this thought came to me is just to be real honest with you I was sitting on a deal stand Wednesday morning I guess all the days run together I didn't know what day it was when we come back all I know is we back thank you that was my wife that could have been an old me that was last week First Corinthians oh dear I'm going do like I told Brother Allan I said Don't Preach my sermon again let me do it all right 1 Corinthians 1231 but I sit on a deer stand and I thought Lord CU every time I'd call home Jun say well we're praying called Danny Danny said well we're praying and I know you guys were praying that we'd get a deer well I thought well Lord why didn't you just put one in my lap I mean I was getting kind of low you got J I was kind of having a pity party for myself cuz we had done all this work all these years put all these trail cameras out put all this you know try to get everything done and then we get nothing yeah but we didn't get nothing because remember character is built by Battles by experience and if we walked out in the woods every time shot a deer we'd quit going y we really would you could going wouldn't be any fun anymore so the thought came to me it's like well just if you got what you think you got speak the word I said okay give daddy a deer doesn't matter just give him one doesn't make it don't have to be no Dimension or you know whatever how big it is and it didn't happen well we come back in and the thought come to me well you don't have what you think you have I said that's okay and then Wednesday before we were getting ready to go to church well I was sitting out in the deer stand they were getting ready to go to church I went we were just a little late we weren't late we were just not 30 minutes before service but uh but the pastor told me I could hunt till dark right so that's okay but I was thinking I said Lord you know this is just hunting I mean yeah God can use a situation and we all think that we want to be so spiritual that everything we do and that we ask for it's got to have some kind of meaning to it I'm just hunting I'm enjoying nature I'm enjoying the outdoors uh take a take a book and read I finish my adoption series I reading my books you know and you know thanking the lord for what he' done and if he give us a de that's fine if he didn't I don't worry about it and the devil can't stand that cuz that's the first thing he does he goes ah see there let's read this this but covet earnestly the best gift now it goes through chapter 12 giving out the gift all right which is wisdom Faith healing Miracles Aaron went through this one time this and he did a good job on it prophecy and this is verse 9 and 10 of 12 you just go through all that Paul is bringing a point down cuz watch in verse 31 covet earnestly the best giftss and yet show I unto you a more excellent way righten than what those gifts amen because gifts and callings are without repentance right though I speak with the tongues of men and angels right and have not charity right I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol right and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Seven Seals and Thunders and all he says all it right right and all knowledge and though I have all Faith to produce that deer you know who I blame myself none of you cuz you know that's first thought goes to a human mind well somebody out there that's praying got something wrong with them right no I said Mr Dale there's something wrong with you do we know who we are that's it let's don't fake this thing right come on you better know where you at amen cuz you know what you're going to manifest that's what it says in the scripture you're going to manifest who you are sons of God will manifest your yourself but the sons of the devil's going to manifest yourself too and have not charity I am nothing if I have even if I can even take a mountain and pick it up and move it that's right and have not charity I am nothing that's right now I want you to take that word charity and I don't have time not going to do it today but take that word charity and run it through amen watch brother brandham talk about love that's right as being corrective and not the love like you and I supposed to have with husband and wife love you do you everything goes for good no that's not exactly all of Charity come on just study it yourself that's right right and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor right and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth nothing and then Daddy read read the last of it this morning right charity suffers long and is kind envieth not vault is not itself and is not puffed up now let's go back to Romans 8 we'll read one scripture we'll be done let me tell you a little story it's not a story it's true true happening uh last month they were telling us out in Oklahoma that there was a brother came by a priest didn't tell us who it was I really don't care who it was and uh he gets up after the service you know I mean gets up during the service and he preaches this message and then he comes in and he says he says I feel the spirit of discernment coming on me did you know what the problem with the whole thing was you didn't use it to me that's the problem yeah if you take a congregation like this and I tell you that I feel a spirit of discernment come on me and he said I pray Lord that I don't use it that's exactly words of man said that's what they they were telling from a person in congregation I thought Lord that's kind of how I got this message here because if we got it you better use it yeah if you don't have it and say you got it you're in trouble amen if that guy stepped up and said what he said and he didn't use it I doubt he had it the right way because this thing is supposed to be that the word is a discerner amen of the thoughts and intents of the heart not the person William Brandon was not a discerner it was the word he brought that's right put him into a place Hallelujah that the word discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart William bram's mind he said I can't discern you I can't discern what you people think but God knows exactly what you're thinking today tomorrow the next day and two years ago but if a man comes and says that that's what brother asked me he said should he have said that I said well I said I'm not a judge of of people but if I would have said it and been telling the truth it could have used it could have been used amen right does everybody understand what I'm saying that's what I'm saying don't let's don't get this thing in trouble where you try to work something up right amen try to bring a spirit in here it may not be a spirit of discernment that's right amen because it didn't manifest itself does everybody understand what I'm saying now let's take that in our life do the same thing if God brings you a gift and you don't use it it's your problem but if a gift comes and you use that gift and it's true then that gift is from God Amen that sign and that wonder is to be followed but it's to be checked by what first amen the word in the mouth of two or three Witnesses am let everything be established right Romans 8 here's the key I didn't read far enough most people stop at verse 23 let's read 24 and 25 for we are saved by hope right but hope that is seen is not hope right it's a reality right manifest huh right right right you see where this is going right one more time you see where this is going Hallelujah for what a man seeth why does he hope for it like that man with a gift if he had a gift he should have used it brother Tom if he had a gift and he and that gift become one he should have used it then it wouldn't have been a hope anymore it wouldn't have been well I wonder if this guy had something no you going to know the Bible says you known as you known right right in other words you're manifesting now what you are listen to verse 25 let me put this in my word but if we can't manifest the part of the word we see come on are not Quicken to us if we cannot manifest it right then do we with patience wait for it that's right sir you say that's too simple yes sir that's exactly what you're supposed to do and to me waiting is Discerning that's right right the Bible says don't put your hand on somebody suddenly right what discern right right I used to be real quick on the trigger not anymore sometimes you run your tongue out somebody step on it thank you but that's the whole thing Paul if you'll watch Paul he writes this whole letter chapter 8 he's bringing a thought to with the Redemption of the body right and he stops he's like okay but that's not all that's right because everybody's not going to attain to it at the same time that's right it's going to develop in others quicker than you know can't like walking and doing the things um walking and talking and all the things that kids do some do it so he's coming backing up because remember up there in verse 15 he says we receive the spirit of bondage we won't don't receive receive the spirit of bondage the Fe but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry to have a father well that's what he's saying in verse 24 because we're saved by hope hope which is Faith we're Saved By Faith right then all this other's coming in but now wait wait if all this is not coming at the same time then let's keep on hoping and patiently wait for it and it that's why that we must lay our rest solemnly on the word of God Amen I believe brother boy that this word will do what it says I cannot believe what I'm going to do everything I do is going to be that that's right that's right I can't believe every feeling and every emotion but I believe the word says if we'll do what the word says it'll back itself up that's why I was trying to get them to see in Oklahoma that we were chosen in him we're not chosen of ourselves right so everything that's done is done inside in him in his economy so if we if it comes to the place of where we you know forsake the S get S together and all those things like that if you're outside of that then don't think you're going to come to this adoption that's right okay Paul's saying we're saved by hope we're Saved By Faith right in this word but there's more oh yeah because what's coming we're going to wait for it right that's what he's saying right that's what he's saying it's coming amen it will manifest itself just wait on it amen and waiting in Christianity waiting is not sitting in a Pew and just going to sleep that's right right it's doing something right in motion the word wait means to T right just hang on a minute but didn't brother brand say we would come to a place that we'd be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture right amen waiting in a place that's not bad then it's not bad to wait sometimes you say well you know you got these people like I was telling them you know there's none good no not one and be therefore perfect permissive will perfect will we preached all that same thing with people they're going to say well you know I'd rather have a little fire than no fire at all but I want it to be the right fire and I want it to be the right fire at the right time and it will because there's going to be a predes predestinated group that will that's right all right let me read you one thing then we'll go read 2 Thessalonians 2:9 talking about the man of sin says even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders that's right Prophet said Satan can hand out Supernatural gifts but he cannot handle the word of God amen amen he cannot come service by Service and bring the word of God right somewhere has got to be off that's right and it don't have to be off but one word that's right that's why we're so zealous in this church of all the doctrines you say well maybe that won't hurt you aen probably thought that wedge wouldn't hurt anything right nobody's going to miss this brother call there probably a me of stacked out there there's nobody going to miss this one it destroyed how many of his Brethren yeah amen 16 13 there how many died 32 32 he killed 32 of his Brethren just because not that it was the wedge Joshua told him to not God told him that's right he said do not bring anything into this Camp that's wrong same thing with here let's stand you love the Lord amen I am looking for sign amen I see a sign every day when I can come to a place that God wants me to be that's the greatest sign in the world Amen and then one day you know what he's going to do he's going to back up what I say ain't that right he's going to back up amen he's going to back up go back to the promise right he promised me I could have my children right he promised me that I could have a life with a wonderful wife and have a good church to go to amen he promised me all these things in the Bible he made a promise that one day we're going to stand on this Earth and we're going to rule and Rain not with a rod of iron that's for God to do in judgment right but you and I are going to rule and Reign that's right priest and Kings right my what a wonderful time go ahead it's all scripture given by inspiration of the Holy Ghost yes sir well what you said while ago you said that all the things wasn't in there that were supposed to be in there but it's all in there oh absolutely there's no doubt it's right you got it that's right cuz we read between the lines we know that those things happen we understand we've got to weave this into our life to where that one day and like dy's always said we're not doomsday preachers and it's not that this is got to happen and then that's got to happen no the Readiness of you and I is what's got to happen that was the promise that the prophet made to us said when you get ready and when you find find out your position and get in it you'll be an invincible Army amen is that right let's bow our hand dear heavenly father we love you we thank you today for your word we thank you for your people we thank you for the love that you've given us amen and the people that we can love and people that love us back we pray now that something would just touch our hearts and heal us Lord not of not of maybe all of our physical condition but maybe of some of our spiritual condition that that you'll come down and you let your word Lord just use the eyes out that you would cleanse us Lord and keep us clean forgive us of our sins Lord if we've done anything any of the congregation Lord we ask that you'd forgive us Lord yes Lord anything Lord that any done to anyone Lord that you'd forgive us cleanse us Lord the only way we can be cleansed is by the washing of water of the word Glory no other way Lord you said you're the way the truth and the life there's no other way besides you father I pray that you just touch us now reveal yourself to us be with us Lord as we take this communion father I hope you Lord I hope you just bless what I've said to the people thank you Jesus even though I be a Cast Away Lord It's not that sometimes we feel good about what we say but maybe Lord you touched someone's heart that's maybe they felt that that that's what they needed Lord we pray that You'

saying come on come on amen that's just appreciate appreciate everything and let's read the scriptures right in to the the communion no we're not going to have the foot worship because this be we decided not to do that won't be long with we had the New Year Serv amen let's just read the scripture here and then go to the communion from 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup he up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you to sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh dnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's life for this caus many are weak and sick be among you and many sleep right we should judge ourselves we should not be or if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest was the rest will I set in order when I come let's just have a moment of solid believing thanking God for all that he's done just like brother testifying am you know come in they don't get nothing brother colie years ago he was up here speaking and man broke in his home we just asked God to give him the gun back man just brought the gun back see I believe that God is still alive I believe the same one I like what the prophet said he said outside of the corporal body the Lord Jesus Christ is here now just like he was before because in Hebrews 138 what would he be outside of the Corporal body see it's it's not here but we're the body this is what we're talking about but let's just have a moment of Silent love you you father for all you give to us so freely unto us we love you Jesus name we took bread bled father we thank you for this bread it's been given unto us Lord for one purpose this afternoon that's for this day it's been made for this time not to be held over for but be for your honor and Glory so we ask you to sanctify the bread because it's a example of Thy Word that we lord partake and as we eat this bread it goes into our natural body then we drank the wine and it stimulates that and tomorrow our blood cells are being reproduced because of the things we eat today we love you and we thank you bless you lord your word is already blessed so you can bless us keep us in Jesus name you know I always think of the children of Israel in their last me while they were down in Egypt made it a Passover the time you know it was the last one you know one day this is going to be the last one amen and then the next one will be in glory be a wonderful time amen we can really Rejoice have a good time in him and know what this is not this you know we call it an example it's true just an example what about a good example what about the way that God would think of this and give us this and how much more should we honor and respect we seen people healed by taking the communion so then you know let's believe it said didn't go on with what said this is a body that was broken father we thank you for this wine has went through the process and now get better each day so we pray now that you would just Lord bless and father that you would let that quickening power that her brother was talking about the revelation of Thy word come into our hearts and our lives that we may walk together in you Quicken the word that we may see it see it may manifest we love you we thank you sanctify the bread sanctify the wine and the partakers all together in Jesus come morning and I by the river free how and rejected and I question father I take and it gives me strength morning be ever bring free car cross through the mid what about a wonderful time an understanding thank you Jesus have a revelation not to just ritual or a thing to do or something that happen once a month but to know for assurity what you're talking about to know that this is not the body this is not you said well we we never did believe that weish whatever you we didn't believe like the Catholics well what did we believe we used to order it from a publishing place right right and get it in a bag and keep it and used the same bag for a year and do it and then we use weles grape juice because we didn't want the children to take any wine to get a taste we thought we was you know we thought we was right but was we right or what would we thank God for the truth truth shall set you free it's a wonderful day a wonderful time wonderful opportunity amen amen hallelujah h you want to thank the the children amen I didn't hear any of it we got here said what they going to do I don't know are they going to sing
