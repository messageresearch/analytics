here good to uh good to be alive and well and serving the lord amen that was a good song We I appreciate that that was a real good song that's hard that song was hard when you're singing it going down the road you you can't keep up with him hard they it was pretty it was pretty tough but I sure enjoy that that was a beautiful song and uh when it's sung by the bride it makes a little it has a little different ring to it you know they sing it professionally with every note and I was listening to One going up to to Camp the other day and I mean it's you hear all that reverberation in the back and you hear that it sounds like they're in a Big Concert Hall that's all added that's all that's all fake stuff they add all that and U the squeaky voices they take them out so the only thing is real is the people of God the people of God's real when you sing you can sing out of you can sing squeaky whatever you want to sing but you do it to the glory of God and that's all that matters so if you got your Bibles let's turn to uh The Book of Luke the first question that we have today is what is the bosom of Abraham so we're going to discuss that just a little bit and uh it's a good question uh but remember also to the uh announcements remember the paper uh down on the uh it's on I meant to tell you today it's on the refrigerator downstairs and just get ready for this in two weeks brother Bob will be speaking this coming Sunday U I'll be gone I'll be in Kentucky hunting and uh then the 17th will be our Thanksgiving dinner um church will be providing the Mee and and you just provide the sides and then we sure do appreciate each and every one of you staying for communion in foot washing and uh it just seems that sometimes that uh uh um ordinances are not important to people uh and I'm sorry but they are God put them in there you tell me where he took them out so they're very important to do and and the Lord said do this till I come well he's yeah we know he come in 63 and I've had heard that argument before but um I believe what brother Brown said about the gifts I believe the ordinances too the ordinances were given to keep the church clean everything God give us was to keep the church clean there's nothing dirty about God it's us we're the dirty ones and we have to be kept clean we have to be Washed by the Water of the word all the time man to get the dirty smut of the world off and and uh we sure appreciate you being here so let's uh let's go to the Lord in prayer dear Lord thank you for this day you've give us thank you for the word that you've give us that you've that you've given us this full seven course meal Lord that when we open the pages of the book we can read it like no one else on the face of the Earth we can read it with inspiration and we can read it with faith that it was given to us by a prophet in the end time correctly we don't have to wonder whether this one's right or that one's right Lord we know that you sent us a prophet that gave us a correct interpretation of the word of God lord just as you wrote it we're seeing it father and I pray that you just be with each one give us all strength for this journey bless the ones that are sick the ones that couldn't be here Lord I pray that you'd bless them be with brother Bob and him they'll be on the way back pretty quick on the highways bless each one as we travel father around the country and different places lord it's just the devil wants to get rid of us and and um Lord I pray that you'll protect us and let that angel be sitting there with us Lord everywhere we go and everything we do but we'll Lord we'll be fearful to give you the praise and honor and glory for all things that we that we have and all things that we do and all the things that's coming up father I pray that you'd bless each one open the words to us father in Jesus name amen all right let's read the book of Luke can everybody see that okay don't ask me to do something again hang on how'd that that work okay okay all right Luke 16:22 now it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into the into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes and being in torments and seeth Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his bosom and cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame go ahead and be seeded and we'll continue reading this but the question was what is the bosom of Abraham or Abraham's bosom and it's also called Paradise all right it's also called Paradise Jesus told the U the thief he said today you'll be with me in Paradise all right now the bosom of Abraham as we continue reading this the bosom of Abraham is what the Old Testament Saints look toward they look toward Abraham Abraham was their father the father of Faith he was and I was thinking a few minutes ago you know man is a great mystery nobody you know until brother brandham came along no one said that Abraham and Sarah had their body changed nobody they just had a child in their old age that's what the Bible says but we realize and I think that I think the people that studied the word of God in that time realized also that there was something happened to Abraham and Sarah it was something abnormal they had a child and then grandma was so beautiful that a king wanted her you know so I think they read between the lines their s CU even uh you know we all know brother Dale always told us that the the Pharisees knew what happened in the garden see they they weren't full of all this other ideas back then even when Kus was here on Earth 2,000 years ago when Jesus came along they were blinded to who Jesus was but they weren't blinded to what happened in they read that old Old Testament way more than we read the New Testament they it was required that they know that thing I mean up down sideways whatever they said you know you could roll it up and stick a pen through it and it they tell you every scripture that it went through so they studied it they weren't just dilatory and said well we're looking for a messiah no they knew what how he would come and even Jesus said have I not come in the way you you that that the word said I was going to come where have I missed it at and I say that the same thing with brother Brandon where where did he where did they miss it at they missed it in him coming being the prophet in the end time and just called him a good guy he was a good preacher he had a good Healing Ministry but his when he started preaching you know he was off well that's we don't believe that we know that all right so what is the bosom of Abraham so everyone looked toward Abraham Abraham was the father of their faith Abraham was the father of their nation and that's kind of weird because Abraham was a gentile you you know but but they call Abraham you know the father he was a Hebrew Abraham the father of our faith well they look toward Abraham for everything definitely Lous he identified in hell he knew who Abraham was cuz he said Father Abraham right so the bosom of Abraham was a place the word bosom means right here in the center you you your sisters you you take your children and you put them in your bosom right you put them right here in your breast right here to hold on cuz that's where your heart is well that's when people they couldn't call it anything else there was really nothing in the Old Testament except that they would pass away and and that that some may be an angel and some may be this but they knew that that if you were faithful to Abraham and you're faithful to the doctrines of Abraham that you were going to go into a place all right they were going to place of holding or waiting because remember I I think maybe some of the question will get will develop here in just a few minutes because there's a difference in the bosom of Abraham there's a difference in that paradise and what we're looking at now right right there's a difference there we know there's one thing for sure God knew people would die so he set a place for everyone to go there's not a soul wandering somewhere out in another dimension that's just wandering around and then all of a sudden one day you're going to find out where you're at no everyone is going to a place all right when he die you got to go somewhere because remember you don't die you just move your Dwelling Place all right you move from there to here so you move your Dwelling Place one of them still on okay so the bosom of Abraham was a place that they had seen in the Old Testament that they were going to go to waiting for the Messiah to come cuz they believed in the resurrection I mean all this is not not that this wasn't foreign when Jesus started talking even they knew those things they just didn't think he was the one to bring it they didn't think he was the Messiah because number one I think their eyes were blinded we know that but they wanted him they wanted him to come the way they wanted him to come amen right is that the same way we're looking at do we want the word to come the way we want it to come or do we want it to come the way God wanted it to come all right we don't want it the way we we'd like to have well we'd like to have this and we'd like to be able to sit at home and press play we'd like to be able to put our jammies on and watch service and we had we're just lazy I'm sorry I do the same thing amen but this is De pressing this is a battle this is something you got to face every day something that's not normal tomorrow's going to be normal for us at work you're going to get up in the morning you're going to go to work that's your normal routine most people take Sundays off and in the world and they party they go to ball games they do picnics they go visit Grandma they go do all these different things on Sunday what do we do we come to church all right so we're kind of weird but we are fulfilling scripture so that's okay so let's read this one more time in the Book of Luke it came to pass that the beggar died now the beggar's name is Lazarus we're going to see this in just a few minutes the beggar's name is Lazarus now whether it's the Lazarus that that Jesus resurrected it doesn't say it's not real clear but we know the Rich Young Ruler is the one that died all right cuz brother R even brings it out and I didn't bring the quote so the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes now remember for the for the person that asked the question you look hell is at this moment is not burning as we know of burning fire all right it sh goana a place that you're going to go that you have no there's nothing there but but torment because as brother R said it has no foundation so you just continually falling how many's ever had a I had a dream one time that I was falling it was horrible woke up catching you know trying to catch yourself well you laying in a bed well what about if that was over and over every day if that feeling was every day and you knew then you were at a place that you were that God was not there someone said one time that's the worst hell you'll ever have is is to know that you're at a place that you can't get to God cuz right now you can get to God but you can't get to God then God is not even in that Dimension all right right so now look and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his bosom so when we look at these dimensions there is somewhere that those overlap according to the Old Testament all right is everybody with me you don't have to agree with me just listen because there was a witch of indoor we're going to read it here in just a little bit there's a witch of indor brought up the soul of Samuel from a place and that which said I see Gods many people in this different dimension coming up and down and and all that you understand what I'm saying and then Samuel stands there talks to her and talks to Saul he says Saul tomorrow you're going to fall in battle and you'll be with me all right so now let's watch because that that's because that's the blood of bulls and goats all right there is sin still there now I can't explain that there's one thing I can't explain their soul was not born again so their soul was not God at that moment right there was a covering for sin made and we'll read it in book of Hebrews there was a covering for that there was not an eradication of that but see thank God he knew that and if they would do the ordinances of God and really in their heart feel that they've done that ordinance to take away their sin then God would cover it until he went to Calvary all right because the bosom of Abraham and Paradise is going to be done away with now let me caution you because if you look into the into the Bible is that heater on or the or the fan on we've had a little mix up because we've all the different times and and we usually don't have church on Sunday but if it's on about 70 it's okay I guess okay so we come to a place that we look and see that paradise brother R will tell us that we walk down through the paradises of God that's a different place there was a paradise made cuz Jesus said today you'll be with me in Paradise right but there is the paradise of God that we're going to go and the uh the Millennium won't be come on the Millennium is not the paradises of God there's still going to be people there there's going to be uh a man named devil there there's going to be different things that you're not going to have but that new city will be none of that there all right that's the paradises of God that the people are going to walk out and be able to uh U we can't fathom what it would be like right amen but it's there and it's inside of you crying out today if you're born again that's where your Paradise is that's where your new city is it's inside of you today right amen but that couldn't be inside of those Believers with just a covering of bull goat blood animal Turtles doves and all that stuff that couldn't take away sin but God so graciously put a place that he could keep them in cuz he knew we were going to die like I said before he knew we were going to die so as soon as Adam died there was a place for him to go as soon as different ones died Isaiah Jeremiah all the old soon as Moses died there was a place for them to go to right they weren't floating around so God had it all worked out but we know that we see that in the Old Testament speaking of the bosom of Abraham and then Jesus saying today you'll be with me in Paradise all right which was when they died he went to Paradise with Jesus but then they resurrected back up and Paradise was done away with we'll get to that in just a few minutes so in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham a far off so there must be a way that you could see through those Dimensions because there was you know you didn't have a place that says all right this is where if you trusted in Jesus Christ this is where you go cuz remember you go back in the holy of holies that thing covers it stops there's nothing you can't look through it and look out back and look all these different place just right there right all right if y'all start falling asleep now I'm going to put some holy water on you he'll be real holy when I throw it at you holy cow and Lazarus was in his book so la look Lazarus was safe whoever that rich young ruler was and he was in torment he could look and see someone that was in safety Lazarus was probably sitting there beside of Abraham and they were talking walking and all of a sudden the dimensions opened up and here's Laz here's the Rich Young Ruler over in another place and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame now remember that can't be a flame that consumes him right all right that can't be cuz he would he would just went away but it was a it was a fire that was burning that wasn't burning him up it was a torment but Abraham said Son now look this is Abraham talking to it Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thy good things and likewise Lazarus received evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented how about that that'll show you one thing for sure money don't mean your position in heaven money don't mean you gonna get in a cushy place or not get in a cushy place right CU if the beggar made it to heaven and the rich man didn't there's a there's a story there somewhere yeah all right but now he is comforted and thou art tormented now watch now Abraham knew enough to tell Lazarus or tell the Rich Young Ruler you can't switch back and forth praise the Lord it thundered and besides all this now besides everything I've already told you Rich Young Ruler between us and you there's a great Gulf fixed what is a gulf it's a body of water that separates two pieces of land and you can't get across if you I mean you just can't walk across and that's what he was telling he said look in other words you've made your choice and you are there the ri the uh beggar has made his choice and I've made mine and we are here but you can't come over here and we can't go over there all right can't switch back and forth right and besides this between us and you are a great Gul fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you hence where he was at to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from th then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou would send him to my father's house now here's the Rich Young Ruler saying okay if I can't get out of this send the message to my family my brothers my five brothers don't come here do whatever you got to do to not come here amen sounds like the Plan of Salvation to me if you'll get it for I have five Brethren that he may testify to now watch this is this is how how God works because that sounds good right I'm in a place of torment and I want you to send somebody to my family's house and tell them don't come to this place Abraham's fixing to tell him in so many words they ain't going to do them no good they got to decide not because you're burning up and you don't want them to burn up they got to make a decision for their own self for I have five brothers others that he may testify that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment now this is going to kind of cover a little bit what I was saying this morning cuz I'm telling you without a believing set of eyes and a believing set of ears you'll fall for anything and you'll call good and bad and bad and good but good bad or bad good because watch what Abraham said now watch and Abraham saith unto him says unto who the Rich Young Ruler that wants that message to come out into Lula church today those of you that are with usen and Abraham said unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them in other words you're sitting in this Dimension you're hearing the voice of of God not me the voice of God teaching you talking to you watch but he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they'll repent and Abraham said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead amen that's right what I was telling you this morning you could announce all over the country that brother Ram's come back from the dead and he's going to preach right here they won't be no more people they'll be as all the excuses that need to be and they'll not believe he's him just like they didn't believe Jesus was Jesus amen sorry about that that's what this whole thing is this whole allegory is telling us about though someone come from the dead and say I have come from listen if you bless you if you can't see Jesus Christ has come from the dead and he's in your heart I can't put him in there right amen your daddy can't put you put him in your mama can't put him in there you got to ask him to come in there but he said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither in other words what was that that was a message Moses and the prophets hey that's pretty good that wasn't just some Corner Street Preacher we're talking about Moses and the prophets neither will they persuade though one rose from the dead Luke 23 339 says one of the malactor which was hanging railed on him and said if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answered rebuking him saying dust not thou fear God seeing thou are in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing a Miss now how do you know that how do you know that cuz Jesus went to Pilot's Hall that morning they killed him that afternoon right here right that was a revelation that was him speaking with inspiration that he knew that this person whoever it was there was something way different about him even though they saw him hanging on the cross cuz the other two were probably cussing each other out and cussing this and cussing that and Jesus is just hanging there and he said father forgive them for they don't know what they do they knew he was different right and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say un you today shalt thou be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour and there was Darkness over the Earth until the ninth hour and the sun was darkened the veil of the temple was rent in the midst now watch the veil of the temple was rent in one scripture says top to bottom all right so there's no way that thing's like 40 foot tall there's no way man could reach up there and do it and pull it down it had to be God ripping it from the top to the bottom because what did that do that told us us that the veil was now going to be rent from the Old Testament to the New Testament and then that would be unveiled and your sin would be not covered eradicated that's what it shows me that's what it tells me there's a new order but remember what they do they sewed the thing back up started sacrificing bulls and goats went right back to doing an offering until 870 which was 40 years after Jesus died they just kept right on doing it until they destroyed the temple and Jesus cried with a that's what I'm telling you without a revelation we are not going to make it without God revealing supernaturally to you why you're here and why this message is the way it is and why it's being told or preached the way it is you're not going to understand it it's just going to be just like I'm sorry but it's like the old Charlie Brown thing with him and his teacher wow wow wow wow wow that's about all you're going to get amen cuz you don't see the fervor of people anymore you don't see the everything that we do needs to be hung on to the word of God Amen when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said this he gave up the ghost so where'd he go where'd he go now brother R tells us he went to hell first then he went to par paradise and saw Abraham right thank God for a prophet so let's read that well let's read in numbers a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them up without the camp in a clean place now this is this is the red heer that you have to kill the red heer you have to take his ashes and put it in water because it's a uh it's Waters of purification or separation that's why that Israel is now producing red heers I mean in reality amen and can only have like three hairs can be a different color only three how many hairs is on a bull or a heer I'm sorry a heer millions billions only three hairs could be different color well they say they got it now because of um this artificial in intelligence theyd be able to um do the DNA and they've got them they say they got several hundred of them but that's what they need because without that they know the Messiah can't come cuz they have to be purified for their sin messiah's not going to come to the temple without purification of sin listen messiah's not going to come to your temple without the purification of your sin but you hand them over to him and he takes care of them eradicates them gets rid of them and we ain't got to worry about them anymore but now we'll read here in a minute where Paul tells us that every year they made the same sacrifice over and over again oh right that's why God had to lay us apart heart over here for the Old Testament for for Samuel and for Saul and for all the ones you know sometimes we we put Saul in Hell Samuel he said you'll be with me tomorrow wherever Samuel was is where he was all right so we have to be careful we the old saying is is you know you get to heaven and you're going to wonder who why in the world this person made it and you're going to ask what are they saying they said well they're wondering how you made it so we'll be Sur R probably and the man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the heer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is a purification for sin it's not an eradication of sin it's a covering of sin amen all right and God honored that because that's what he told him to do in the Old Testament but once the ultimate sacrifice came all that changed all right so let's go to Hebrews 9 and verse 8 the Holy Ghost is signifying now look there's no mention of the Holy Ghost in the Old Testament it's the spirit of God or the Lord um and all these different things but it never says holy spirit or Holy Ghost why that was in Jesus that was that that's why folks you have to be real careful nobody in the the Old Testament had the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul amen right they couldn't right whatever God I say whatever I know you know whatever God had he had the book of names all right he give it to Adam as I said this morning Adam took the book everybody with me all right then that was supposed to be that the Holy Ghost was going who overshot Mary okay thank you than you everybody with me now the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary right there was a seed and a and a and a um egg both planted in Mary without sex there was no there was no emotion no desire right with me now remember he was the second Adam that's the way the first Adam was supposed to produce the second Adam produced it spiritually right right cuz when you got born again the seed of God was planted inside of you right they had over here before the fall everybody with me so the books here Adam has the title deed let's say to eternal life which is this the ability to say come forth every how you want to say tell it to to Eve or it would be no sex it would be just speaking spoken word is the Original Seed all right so that was the original way that was going to happen happened but once Adam and Eve polluted both mind and womb God shut the book the holy ghost overshadowed Mary so who's coming the book's coming it couldn't drop in Moses it dropped on Moses amen that's right it couldn't drop because I'll tell you something in just a minute it could drop on Isaiah but not go inside Isaiah it could drop on David and anoint David but it didn't make David's Soul Eternal right it would go upon this one because if you'll remember even John the Baptist now the Bible says he got the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb you can argue all you want to he did not have the new birth right he might have got the Holy Ghost but he didn't have the new birth right the woman at the well did not have the new birth right the new birth only came when Jesus had this inside of him and said the Holy Ghost is going to come back on you not on you but in you I'll be with you even in you in because remember John the Baptist was told there would be one come remember there'll be one come that when the Holy Ghost descends on that person it'll not just go on them it won't raise back up it'll go in them amen I believe the Bible says John look for the one that the Holy Ghost comes on and Remains the Holy Ghost never remained on anybody in the Old Testament except Adam but Adam was imparted eternal life he had to be cuz he was the first one he was the first one coming up excuse me he wasn't born a baby he wasn't born in sin but the sin came afterwards everybody with me it must be hot pinch yourself so so now the Holy Ghost didn't come until the day of Pentecost right to dwell in a group of people those pillows of fire sunk into those people they went in them and they became what should have been over here in this book the names in this book Peter James John all the other 11 even Matias that received the Holy Ghost that's the way we should have come over here born by the Breath of God we've been te teaching that for a long time right so there was listen God is not the author of confusion and he won't dwell in an unclean vessel he won't dwell in an unclean place so the paradise had to be a place to where people went that didn't have the Holy Ghost but but they were that God knew by for knowledge who they were what they would be what their heart would be he knew David's heart David's going to be there the weaken tag murder we can tag adultery on him God can't it was eradicated to Calvary everybody with me now all right so what is the bosom of Abraham it's something God put in the Old Testament to put people in a place of holding all right now listen the ones that went on now that are in that sixth Dimension they're in a place of holding but they are locked in there they can't move to the fifth they sure don't want to and the fifth can't move into them but over here there was some way that there was a could be a communication because a witch brought up a prophet a witch brought up a prophet in the Old Testament Witch of indor brought up Samuel and they conversed and even he took and and into this Dimension we're in now he said Saul tomorrow you're going to fall in battle and you'll be with me but now remember over here that can't happen I'll read it to you brother R said there was there was something there was a question asked online or something and uh about where did you get that from that you know people can't communicate well brother r said it once you die he said if you can talk to a saint he said that's a he said that's not a Believer I'll read it to you hang on I got a quote for that so the Holy Ghost this signifying now this is Paul talking that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest he's talking about the Old Testament while as the first Tabernacle was standing what the real Tabernacle in the wilderness and then Solomon's Temple and all that everybody with me the outer Court inner Court holy of holies all right which was a figure for the time then present right in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect right as pertaining to the conscious which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and ordinances imposed on them look until the time of reformation but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle what than the one that's in the wilderness and the one that's over there uh the Solomon's Temple and all that not made with hands that is to say not of this building Paul's probably talking he says not of this building but he's talking about this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us am okay for if the blood of bulls and goats and of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctifying to the purifying of the flesh how much more Paul's saying God allowed that in the Old Testament but how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit not a spirit of an animal the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God in other words this can't do it but this can all right this can still hold you accountable but if Christ Christ hadn't come they'd still be held accountable but Christ came and took them and us that's why his hands were out he stood Between Heaven and Earth he stood between Old Testament and New Testament brought them all together now see we're in the bosom of Christ but I say Christ is in your bosom and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament we'll read it this afternoon when we take communion he said this is my blood this is New Testament and my blood that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament old testament all right they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead now remember the ashes and the heers and the the the the spirits of those animals never could come back on to somebody and make them clean right all right right mortal men couldn't die and come back and can't can't come back and make somebody clean he had to be God himself he was the soul of God so the soul of God can do whatever he wants to do but he came to save your soul for a testament is a force after men are dead so Jesus had to die for the New Testament to become forc what the book could start being named out the names could be coming out in the in the U on the day of Pentecost right otherwise it is a no strength at all while the testator liveth no one received the new birth while Jesus was alive right no one he was the New Birth he told Nicodemus you must be born again but that's telling Nicodemus that when I'm gone you need to get born again all right what y'all eat today y'all eat pasta don't eat carbs whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood now remember the first testament it was dedicated it had blood right but it was the blood of an animal it wasn't strong enough to do away with sin so that you could put these people in one place an eternal Place sixth Dimension all those people are Eternal amen for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water Scarlet wool his up and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and the vessels of the ministry but he couldn't get that inside of somebody that couldn't go inside and change somebody cuz every every year they did the same thing over and over again right that's right and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heaven should be purified with these what animals but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these Christ all right for Christ has not entered into the holy Place made with hands which are the figure of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us listen Abraham was not in heaven right Lazarus was not in heaven all right nor yet that he should offer himself often Christ don't have to offer himself every day for you Bible says one time for all cuz what' he do he didn't just barely sprinkle blood and just get rid of a few things he got rid of everything right that's what we got to believe folks we just don't believe that that blood's strong enough to take everything away from us that's what's going to change our body amen it's when we come to a place that we are We Are The Perfect sinless Bride of Jesus Christ and we know that by our heart not by our voice our quote for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto man once to die but all after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time that's us in the end time that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation now the Book of Matthew tells us says Jesus when he cried with a loud voice he yielded up the ghost now remember he had when he right before he died he said today you'll be with me in Paradise told the told the uh thief on the cross you'll be with me in Paradise so somewhere between that time and this time Jesus went to hell come back up Paradise pick this guy up and we'll read it brother BR said Abraham and all the some of the Dead Saints rose up okay and behold the veil of the temple was ran in Twain from top to bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were open now if you'll look at that the graves were not like this dirt doesn't hold a spirit right dirt can't hold cement can't hold a spirit nothing can hold a spirit except God himself so the graves were open there was an opportunity for their the Theon to come up out of that grave because that theophany wasn't in the grave it came and picked up what was in there and stood up on the Earth right and came out of the and the graves were open and many bodies now I don't understand who God picked it didn't say all it said many of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many right so now that was the emptying of paradise because remember the next person the first martyr to die was Steven now Steven didn't go into Paradise there was no Paradise for him to go into that's right that was after the New Birth the new birth then there was a place a sixth Dimension that The Souls of the ones that were born again went into and and couldn't travel and and definitely don't want to come back over here not yet all right everybody with me we know this now brother B we know this that in the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin it only covered sin and the living look the living just waiting in in Paradise for the day that sin should be taken away but when Jesus came the Son of God the Messiah he took away sin he divorced it never covered it he took it away then now since then if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting in glory we go straight to the presence of the father there to be clothed in immortality all right 1953 demonology now this Witch of indor she called up the spirit of Samuel and Saul talked with Samuel now watch now you might wonder how that could be done it cannot be done today no sir because the blood of bulls and goats was only a waiting for the time time of fulfillment when a man died in them days preachers back me up if you think it's right I probably they they probably didn't when a man died he died under the atonement of an animal and his soul went into paradise and there he stayed until to the day of redemption and his soul was in there everybody understand that what your soul is your soul is your theophany your soul is the spirit man that dwells inside of you and it's you right and and when the Bible says if this Earthly tab Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting there's not something hanging up in a closet like this waiting for your for your soul to to match that one there too many Souls running around you're one Soul when you die your theophany your soul goes to whatever place that it's that that you've told it to go right amen everybody with me so you know even brother Brandon will talk about the offing about this being over here 20 ft away your souls you're theophany there is nothing of you anywhere else and I thank God for that why it's very simple I know what I got to fix I got to fix me I got to fix me that over there is not perfect and I got to make myself perfect to match it no when you get born again that comes to you you that's that Genesis 126 man the part of God that he saw before the foundation of the world comes and resides in your soul and you and him are there together right not two Souls not not go hang it up somewhere and waiting on you to get there brother R said you building it right here right so now look now today he could not break into that realm and get a righteous man out of that realm he couldn't do it cuz righteous men are not in there where they used to be in Paradise no sir Paradise was done away with when the blood of Jesus took it away right everybody with me on that right 1953 demonology ensboro Kentucky the reason that the witch of Endor could call the spirit of Samuel because Samuel couldn't go into the presence of God the bosom of Abraham was not the presence of God right it was the faith of Abraham that you go to a place and believe believe that there's one coming that's going to take away your sins sorry when we go into another dimension either our soul is born again or not so there's not a there's not an in between but they went believing their prophets believing the Ten Commandments and believing the Messiah was coming now watch because Samuel couldn't go into the presence of God now Samuel was a prophet but he only had an anointing he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul and if I may say his soul was still black but it was a there was a time that God knew that Abraham would want that more well he already proved it on on the Earth amen he proved who he was on the earth now look he was in Paradise for the blood of bulls and goats would not take away sin but since Jesus died he divorced sin taken it away and the believer now goes into the presence of God now see that can be misconstrued we don't go right in listen Mama's not walk or my mama not still here but but dad's not walking around with Jesus today right but how many times have you heard that at a funeral are they either they're sit at the feet of Jesus or they're walking with Jesus on streets of gold that's not true it sounds good but that's not true that's coming but they are in a beautiful place don't worry about that and the believer now goes into the presence of God and he can't come back right now what he's talking about before that the Catholics were talking about interceding with Saints talking to him back and forth he said you can't do that now now and he can't come back Jesus said in Luke when he was talking about the rich man he can't return remember there's a great go fixed so if you're interceding with any any kind of a spirit of someone that's gone on outside of God Christ the only mediator between God and man then you are in spiritualism called religion now where is spiritualism at so be careful what you say about the spirit of God communing with Saints is spiritualism all right so be careful all right everybody with me the bosom of Abraham was a place until God could come and die on the cross there was a place that everybody went to paradise and then that it was a holding place right is everybody with Meen right because brother R tells us and I it was a long quote so I'm going to just paraphrase it Jesus died he went to Hell kicked Satan into the into the house took the keys of death and hell but said he came back up through Paradise knocked on the door and he said Abraham opened the door cuz it was the bosom of Abraham everybody believed that Abraham was the father of all this right and Abraham said oh that's the one we fed the calf to right each one saw him in their Revelation like Ezekiel Saw he oh that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel that's the one that did this that's the one that did that oh that's him right right Moses that's when that spoke to me in the burning bush and what did he do he took those Saints and he took them up remember the scripture lead Capt captivity captive give gift to men lift up you Everlasting Gates he he he had to do away with that because the next part that's coming is that we're going to get born again and then we're going to be putting in a different place we're not in Paradise anymore we're going to be put in a place where thank god brother random got to go to and explain to us why and where it at and that we're Eternal it's an eternal place the people are all Eternal it's not in the presence of God so much to say that God's there but had you ever felt the presence of God but you never saw a body you never saw Jesus floating around you understand what I mean you felt this presence they're in the presence of God all the time we're in a wave we get in the presence of God we get in the presence of the devil we get in the presence of this one presence of that one but over there they're continually in the presence of God so the bosom of Abraham is a place that people went before the New Birth that God could hold them there until he died he they were covered by the blood blood of bulls and goats till he died when he died that took that group of people with him and he went took them into a place and they're waiting somewhere right I'm not going to argue with whether they have bodies or not that's not part of my eternal destination okay right you can argue all you want to I don't I don't know right Bible said they resurrected so that's enough for me it's not going to it's not going to make my Revelation any better or worse right I mean it's it's it's in the Bible two to three different ways so you just leave it alone and go on I know one thing's for sure the Bride of Jesus Christ that have passed on are in the sixth Dimension their body still laying in the Tomb right amen that's all I'm worried about because the dead in Christ will rise first so whoever God brings up that's his business but we got to come to a place that they want to come here to get their bodies everybody with me all right now let's go to the short one since you said you're going to cover some of the Mysteries that brother Ram covered which we're going to give us an overview of the 70 weeks of Daniel please in 25 words or less why are we quiet for I know cuz most of you are asleep so Daniel 9 let's go to Daniel 9:23 and we're going to this is going to be you're going to be surprised brother Donnie this is a surprise it's going to not take very long because I want to explain something about Daniel 7 weeks real quick everybody look at me and quit looking over to wall look at me me can somebody not look at me I'm the one preaching to you the Wall's not if you don't like me you can go somewhere else put on some glasses that are like blinders you know and just listen to my voice cuz I believe I'm telling you the truth amen I believe I'm telling you the truth Daniel 70 weeks is to the Jews it is a Jewish restoration of as we say Christianity all right the Jews rejected Christ he didn't kill them and do away with them right he said I'll never forget Israel all right I'll never forget the Jews now they will not have the same position as they used to have he divorced them put them away he said but I can't forget them they'll be my servants right now they're lost right now they rejected their Messiah right right but God's going to come over here after the Gentile dispensation and he's going to give them the Holy Ghost and take them in a Rapture because they are to be the servant in the temple for me and you they lost their bridh good but they got their servant Hood right okay but right now they are I was you know kind of the Jewish thing going on now and U there was this one guy he was a some kind of a anti what do you call it anti anti-semitic you know they're always want to destroy the Jews why people want to destroy the Jews for because they killed Christ a lot of people their their anti-Semitism is y'all killed Christ well if they hadn't killed him folks you wouldn't be here today it was done for a purpose absolutely it was done for a purpose he blinded them he blinded them himself God blinded his own children so that me and you could be sitting here today amen all right so God's going to save a Jewish Remnant all right and he's going to and there is Jews have a time period all right there's a certain time this there's not 13 tribes of Israel now there's 12 there's not 146,000 there's 144,000 there's not 14 Witnesses there's two go God specific even in Daniel he says time times and dividing of times one two and a half so it'll be three and a half years everybody with me so God is specific with time when it comes to the Jews now to me and you as Gentiles time shall be no longer according to Revelations 10 remember the mighty Angel raised his hand he said time shall be no more and and remember everywhere we're we are depicted in the Bible the bride depicted in the Bible it's multitudes there's no number multitudes un you can't count them but you see 24 Elders you see 144,000 you see two witnesses there's always a number right so God's going to give grace to the Jews he's going to save them just like he saved us right they are going to be going to the Millennium the same way we are they're not going to be bride I said this they're going the same way everybody with me but right now they can't do that they rejected Christ they rejected the Messiah somewhere that's got to be reconciled back right so there is a specific number of time to do that because they're Jews so everybody with me now so let's read Daniel 9 at the beginning of thy supplication the Commandment came forth now Dad read this a long time ago way he went way back before before he started Daniel 70 weeks we may do that too but Daniel was the one that said oh God I want to know how much time we have left right prayed for long periods of time fasted for a long period of time and then finally Gabriel shows up and this is Gabriel talking to Daniel right here at the beginning of thy supplication just remember if your prayer is sincere God's not just at the end of it God's at Hallelujah God's at the beginning of it he's the one that gives you utterance and unction to pray do we pray just in our own self no we have to be we have to have an unction that says hey pray for this person or somebody calls or somebody gives us leaves us a text message hey pray and then you in your heart you stop and you say God well now you want to pray for that person come on you want to pray for that person specifically if God had to put that on your heart I don't care if it come through text WhatsApp or whatever it was a communication that got you into a channel to pray for somebody am I am I right that's right so Daniel wanted to know he had been in captivity for 68 years Daniel had been in captivity and he knew that he only had a certain period of time here here we go time certain period of time and it was going to get out now what's going to happen Lord I want to know what's going to happen to my people two more years they were really in captivity sure enough 70 years right right right ended up being 400 and something years later on all right so this is this is a desire of a man's heart for his people to know what's going to happen to my people all right amen so now Daniel 9:23 at the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth in other words what Gabriel got it from God to go tell Daniel what's going to happen and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved good way to get started started therefore be confused with the matter no it says therefore understand the matter right so whatever's coming from Gabriel Brother Aaron is not confusion that's right because this is Gabriel talking to Daniel the whole time amen it's not Daniel talking it's Gabriel talking amen and consider the vision now watch now here we go if it's in the Bible it's got to be explained as the Bible explains it right amen right cuz see where everybody gets in trouble is they say well brother randam said this he can't say anything contrary to the Bible or he's a false prophet right right he can't right he cannot change the Bible he can give us Clarity he can put it in his right place but this is to the Jew CH this is in its right place you just got to understand it so 70 weeks are determined I'm going to break this down in a minute 70 weeks are determined what what is that word determined it's going to happen this is what's got to happen 70 weeks are going to happen upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do six things finish the transgression make an end of sins make reconcil ation for iniquity bringing Everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy so 70 weeks inside of that 70 weeks put your little put your little parentheses inside of that those six things have got to happen all right all right verse 25 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks all right everybody with me amen and three score and two weeks that's two distinct periods right everybody with me a 7we period and a 62 three score six 62 weeks the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times so from Darius and and all the all the Ms and Persians way back over here the edict came for them to rebuild the Temple it took them that period of time to rebuild the Temple and for Jesus to show up at the end of those 62 weeks unto Messiah the prince that's Jesus right right and after not during all right Che yourself just a minute and after 62 weeks shall Messiah be cut off now we're going to go eat after we leave this building we're not eating now right it's after so after these 62 weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for us right all right amen and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and Sanctuary now that is Titus in 870 destroyed the temple took it apart and took it back to Rome right all right that's according to history right and the end therefore shall be with the flood remember the flood ran out the gate they killed everybody they they they walled up Jerusalem wouldn't let nobody out they ate to bark off the trees they ate their own kids right and therefore shall be with the flood and until the end of the war desolations are determined now if we've got we'll break it down in a minute but look we've got s weeks 62 weeks 62 and 7 is what 69 69 we got to have 70 am don't go quoting brother random to me he knew what he was talking about and I know what he was talking about brother Dale and everybody sit in this building pretty much knows what he was talking about there's a mystery in there right that's right cuz you can't make the Bible anything different right and after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself what it was for us and the people of the prince shall come shall destroy the city which was Titus the Romans they destroyed it took it back to Rome and the end therefore shall be with the flood until the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week we had 69 now we got one more week makes 70 there are no half weeks in the Bible of Daniel 70 weeks not one that's right not one people in the message want to find it for me just find it in the Bible don't give me a quote I want the Bible cuz the quote's got to fit the Bible the Bible don't fit the quote and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease we'll talk about that in just a second and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the cons what is the consummation destroying everything right amen and that determine shall be poured out upon the desolate you know brother Ram told us that we couldn't understand a seals unless you understood Daniel 70 weeks well if you don't understand Daniel 7 if you understand it like most people in the message understand it you can't put the woes in there the vows the plagues you got them all happening some other time right and we'll get into that later on when we get into Daniel 70 weeks we'll go all the way to the Future home so now look so now let's stop now everybody open your eyes 70 weeks how do you know that's 490 years brother Bram said that a't that that doesn't that doesn't help me none he got to be in the Bible yes sir all right so let's put let's just hold on for a minute let's go to Genesis 29:26 laan con man conning a con man cuz what he done he said I'll give you Rachel gave him Leah on the wedding night I don't know how that happened must have been real dark correct so Jacob comes out and says you've tricked me I asked for Rachel I love her and then laan says it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn he didn't have enough gumption to say hey buddy you got to marry this one first on the wedding night what he done is he switched the girls right don't ever try that watch what he said though fulfill her weak and we will give thee this also for the service which Thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week if you keep reading them down the Bible that's seven years he worked seven years to get the right girl listen this guy was in love with Rachel cuz he worked seven years and got tricked that's right then he worked and said well dude you got to work seven more and you get the right one what a con man so he went ahead and worked seven more years he fulfilled her week so one week equals seven years in the Bible all right and I know it was a revelation God took him to that scripture but he brother R just didn't pull stuff out of the air it had to be a Bible prophet he had to have it in the Bible amen okay so now one week equals 7even Years everybody with me so 70 weeks 70 * 7 is 490 years I know some of us went to school and made it through and you can add that up and divide it and subtract it and multiply it but 70 * 7 is 490 years so it's going to take 490 years for God to restore Israel that's right exactly okay here's your bracket 490 years 70 weeks or 490 years are determined and that word determined means decreed upon thy people who is that the Jews right and upon thy Holy City Jerusalem here's what people in the message get it all mixed up it's to two sets of of of situations right it's to Daniel's people and to build the city back right right and it won't be built back right till they in the Millennium till the mill till right before the Millennium and we'll get into that later on then there's six things that God's going to do through two prophets right amen God had to send them a prophet he didn't send them a preacher he sent them a prophet he's going to send them too Moses and Elijah right and they're going to preach to finish the transgression they're going to preach to make an end of sins they're going to make reconciliation for iniquity and number four bring in Everlasting righteousness number five SEAL up division in Prophecy and number six to anoint the most holy all right everybody got it 70 weeks is 490 years that's the time it's going to take to bring Israel back 490 years right all right so one week equals 7 years we've already established that laan said fulfill her week so he fulfilled seven years Years also in Matthew 18 said Peter came to Jesus and said Lord how often should my brother sin against me and I forgive him seven times Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee un seven times but 70 times seven that's he told them exactly how long it would take to get Israel back to where they're supposed to be amen amen so he's going to forgive them 70 time 7 490 years all right now look follow me real fast know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and build Jerusalem we'll get into that there was there was some people Nehemiah different ones coming and said look we need a temple amen we need a city with walls right and they built a city with walls but they built it in troubless times because they had a trial in one hand and a sword in the other that's right cuz all the neighbors knew if they built that City back God was going to be in that City or that Temple right so they used a trial to build the wall and they had a sword in his hand to fight even in troubless times amen all right everybody with me so from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem the city unto the Messiah the prince which showed up in birthed in a 4 ad and or 4 BC and we'll study that later on shall be seven weeks what is seven weeks 7 * 7 is 49 you can read it right there I ciphered that for you last night or this morning and three score in two weeks 62 weeks time 7 is 434 years is everybody with me you got it okay all right right so now the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times I just told you what it was so 7 weeks plus 62 weeks is how long 69 weeks right not 70 not 69 and A2 not 68 and A2 right 69 so 69 * 7 if you got 69 weeks one week equals 7 years 69 * 7 is 483 we need 490 right and what's 483 or what's 490 minus 483 it ain't three and a half seven one full week left as of today right there's one week left to go to the Jews but now brother I'm GNA tell you this real real quick I don't care what he said if it ain't in the Bible and I'll tell anybody that it's got to be in the Bible if he was a Bible prophet he had to match the Bible the Bible don't match his quote I'm sorry that may be plain but I know God if brother Randon was standing right here he'd say that ain't nothing but the truth cuz he's the one that said it so 69 * 7 is 483 the goal is 70 weeks are 490 years so after 62 weeks Messiah was cut off everybody with me and after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince shall come and destroy the city we read that so at that time when Christ died the Jews said let his blood be on us and our children they They Crucified him they they put him on the cross all right but they did it for me and you he is now turning to a gentile age of approximately 2,000 years the church ages we just got finished where we're in the seventh all right so Christ died come back on the day of Pentecost and there's been 2,000 years and then we're getting ready to close it off and then what's going to happen what's going to happen cuz brother R is and I'm emphatic on this we're not going to see the Antichrist in his fullness we're gone we're gone when he becomes incarnate in a man we're gone that's right so he now here's verse 27 let's find where that next week is we got to have one more week and he now remember that he you could say well that's Christ this he breaks a covenant Christ never breaks covenants man breaks covenants so this guy's going to break a covenant therefore he is Antichrist that's right and he Antichrist shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week or seven years and in the midst of the week which is 3 and 1/2 years that's right he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease he's standing in the temple telling Israel he's God right amen right and they still time left right cuz there got to be one week left after we gone not three and a half there the only three and a half years of ministry absolutely but to finish time on the earth of that 490 years to put them in the Millennium you can't can't stop it at the battle of Armageddon prove it to me prove it to me cuz I'll tell you something the whole the whole thing if you want to get the whole Gest of Daniel 70 weeks go back to the sixfold purpose yes sir go to the sixf purpose and really read it if there's only three and A2 years left listen to me if there's only three as people say there are there's not there's only three and a half years of ministry left but those six things if they're all done in that three and a half year period before the battle of Armageddon you've built a Temple You've anointed the most holy and now you've destroyed it hello but brother R's totally correct there's only three and a half years of Jesus's Ministry left that's right that's in the Bible 1260 days but you got to separate that from the one week left because brother randam in the 70 weeks of Daniel the last thing he preached was the 70th week and he said seven times that there's one week left after the Rapture right all right oh well they say well he got this new revelation when he when he U the seals open that's okay but that new revelation better match this it better match the Bible or it's wrong and it did they just weren't understanding he's talking about a week of Messiah Ministry three and A2 years over here three and A2 years here over there when Jesus then three and a half years here yes that incompasses all the Daniel 70 weeks to those six those three and a half and three and a half but to finish time time Jews and City remember that Jews and city right right there's got to be seven years left after the Rapture right cuz it says right here and he shall make a CO confirm the Covenant of many for one week I had a brother tell me the other day he said well now brother R said the Messiah was cut off in the midst of the week show it to me in the Bible show it to him in the Bible you got about you can have all day you can call me next week so then brother R's not talking about that week he's talking about he was cut off in the week of the midst of the week of the Messiah Ministry of Jesus Christ there's your mystery that brother Dale saw in 1974 and been preaching it ever since I I I'll stand up in front of anybody I see this but you can't get it wrong cuz listen if there's only three and a half years left where you going to put the last wo the last wo is the third world war that's right the V got to be poured out during the tribulation period we'll get to it so let's read one more time then we'll get ready for communion 70 weeks are determined there's going to be 490 years until Israel is restored back and the city yes they have to have a city we don't we're Nations Tong but 70 weeks are determined upon thy people the Jews and thy Holy City Jerusalem to do six things all right now finish transgression now come with me here listen real quick two prophets are going to preach what salvation repentance for 1260 days all right it's going to finish their transgression it's going to make an end of their sins and it's going to reconcile them back to Christ so that he can give them the Holy Ghost and they can go in Rapture are are catching away they're they're catching away everybody with me all right but there's three more left so if all that's got to happen in three and a half years so you going to bring in Everlasting righteousness before you destroy the Earth you going to seal up the vision and Prophecy in the people no and they're gone uh and you going to anoint the most holy you going to you going to build a temple and anoint it and then destroy it no there's your key right there the the Daniel 70 weeks the sixfold purposes three of them happen while the Jews while the two prophets are here that three and a half years and then the other three and a half years is where you're going to have the third W poured out the BS are going to be poured out there's going to be a Great Tribulation there's going to be a a battle of Armageddon then the Jews are going to come back according to Ezekiel 40:44 they're going to build a temple back yeah to finish the 70th week of Daniel and put us put them in the Millennium and they we come Revelations 19 we come into the temple and brother Brown said to anoint the most holy was when we the bride enters into the temple now how is that going to happen in just three and a half years and then the battle of Armageddon is going to destroy the Temple we're supposed to go into right it's so simple that confounds 99% of the people in this message just because of a couple quotes brother randam said and I'm not you know as I well as I do brother randam was not wrong he knew what he was talking about we just don't right he knew what the Bible said but he also knew that that was to the Jews and to get to get away from all the peripherals he said all right there's three and a/ half years of Jesus's Ministry over here he was cut off in the midst of that week amen then there's three and A2 years more for the Jews that's your whole 70 weeks of Daniel it's the ministry of Jesus Christ but it's a one week Messiah Ministry and that's what brother Brown was talking about when somebody said something over here in the seals he said no no no n n n that's not what I said well now what the brother said is exactly what brother R said right don't get quiet on me right exactly son man talking about son of yes that's the son of man he well he preached he preached it himself we're getting that right now we're getting that Ministry well that's then going to go the baby's going to be born and then we're going to give the baby remember the story of of U Boaz and Ruth they have a baby Boaz Ruth was a gentile Boaz was type of Christ they marry they have a baby what do they do with that baby they give it they give it to Naomi the Jewish Mama this message is so real it's going to go to them and they're going to see Christ I want to know though that we they see Christ in us now do they see Christ in us now so there's your Daniel 7 we right there's seven years left after the Rapture to finish the time of Daniel 70 weeks the people and the city there's only three and a half years Ministry left absolutely because that's what the Bible says right but you've got to get them in a temple and then that Temple is Anointed with something in brother brandom if we believe he was a prophet he said we are the anointing to the temple right now do we come back in the middle of battle of Armageddon no we come back in Revelations 19 riding into the Millennium in that Temple that the Jews are how they going to do it I don't know but brother R said one thing he said Gentiles don't know how to build a temple and we don't need one Jews know how to build a temple you read Ezekiel 40-44 it is specifically a certain length a certain height a certain color a certain this a certain that we're not going to build it those Jews are going to build it somehow that 144,000 that has died is going to come back and make that Temple somebody's got to we can't we come back into the Millennium so what puts the Jews in the Millennium puts us in the Millennium cuz you and I got to be the same way he's got to finish our transgression because we're spiritual Israel amen so this happens to us spiritually right make an end of whose sin make an end of our sin make reconciliation for our iniquity bringing Everlasting righteousness if you're born again you're there amen seal up the vision and prophecy what in a group of people that nobody's going to understand nobody's going to understand the vision and prophecy except you and me right and then he anoints us and you know what he anoints us with he anoints us with a getting out of his Spirit to anoint the most holy the most holy is the one that took a resurrection and Ascension that's right oh there's a different one no the most holy is Jesus Christ but now he's decided that it's going to be him inside of a group of people and he's going to raise us up the same way he's going to physically raise the Jews up over when we're out of here let's stand to our feet we'll get all the peripherals and we'll get all the dates and there's the dates all fit so just hang on and get ready for communion thank you for being patient and whoever asked that question I hope it kind of helps a little bit that was a pretty quick overview that was about 30 minutes so that's not too bad told you well when you when you pull it all apart and you look at the pieces they fit they fit you but you can't fit half weeks in Daniel 70 weeks it's weeks it's not half weeks right there's there's a Ministry of a half a week 1260 days but to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel you got to have a whole another week after the Rapture right and that's thus sayi the Bible so that's thus sayith the Lord amen let's bow our heads just for a minute de Heavenly Father Lord thank you for the for the two questions that we tried to answer Lord I Hope We answered them Lord to the U to the um um ability that we can for the people to understand Lord we know we're going to go back over some of these things and and we know that there's one thing for sure without you we have nothing without you there's no Revelation and Lord now you've give us the word of God and youve give us divine inspiration and Revelation through a prophet now you give it to an end time bride that we're standing here today on the throws of going into Rapture father we've got to get this thing done right it's got to be the Perfection of the word of God in a group of saints the father be with us now in this taking of the communion and the footall father forgive us of our sins clean our slate Lord just forgive us of the things that we've done forgive us of being dilatory about not serving you and and and being lazy sometimes and not reading your Bible and maybe reading something else or or doing something else besides worshiping you Lord through even prayer and song and the different things that we can do on our own father I pray that you'd help us to do that more and Lord be more in tune with you be more re rent to what you are and and the Holiness that you bring and that you'll anoint us father for this little bit of time lord the journey is only going to be short it's not going to be a long one we've come to the end of that Journey Lord the last baton has been handed to the end time bride and she's going to carry this thing on to the Finish father I pray that all of us in this building will be part of that and Lord the ones that are not in the building that are connected to everyone in the building may they be brought into the fold father Lord we love you and we thank you for the things that you give us be with us and bless us now in to furtherment of this part of the service in Jesus name amen start with our communion thank you for the questions um I don't have any more now that was the last one so if you have any um send them to me or or uh come and uh hand them to me in a piece of paper questions and answers you know brother Brown said makes a strong church because of fair if you have a question then brother Bown said they he'll put you somebody he'll put somebody in front of you answer that question okay so you may have it in your mind and never say a word to it and you and brother Bob comes up here and he's preaching on let's say he's preaching on communion all of a sudden he jumps over here on water baptism just saying that for for an example well that's what you did you you did that cuz today your question wasn't on communion today your question was on water baptism or you can put whatever you want to in there but that's just an example of this way and that way that's God that does that and see that's why you that's why we're servants we serve you we serve the will of the people I want you to all remember that anybody that holds an office here you serve the will of the people CU you individually only have one vote we don't been through this but collectively we do what you ask us to do what you ask us to do that's what we do and what you pray brother Brandon remember he said what was the success of my my meeting in where whatever that City it was he said God revealed to him it was too late he's got in a closet and was praying for the meeting he said that's why my meeting was successful not that God sent an angel Gabriel or somebody didn't send some great he put two sisters on their heart to go in their prayer closet and pray for that meeting coming up do we pray for this Wednesday night service coming up do we pray for next Sunday coming up do we or do we just show up and say feed me Lord well you might get fed you might not it's remember he'll give you the desire of your heart if you desire to know more of God he'll give you somebody that'll help you to know more and and today I stand here that without brother Dale and his ministry and and brother Mo and a different brother uh um Richard Wilson and and brother Michael teing different ones like that I wouldn't be worth a flip I'd be worthless I'm I'm worthless anyway but with that background something's got to be said that'll help you with all that wisdom and bringing that I'm not the know it all I don't know everything I counsel with different ones y'all know that that's not the one man I have to make the final decision but but I sure you seek counsel Daniel S he he sought counsel different ones a lot of men David sought counsel Solomon they sought counsel and in the counsel there's a scripture there that tells us in in the counsil of the of the righteous there's there's wisdom there there's wisdom in all that so um just pray for us that we'll continue and move on move on with the Lord and uh and be happy in it and not be sad so let's let's read our scripture if you'll pull it up for I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had give thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he also took the cup and when he up saying this cup is what we were talking about a few minutes ago this is the New Testament this is going to be my blood not the blood of bus and goats it's going to be my blood I can actually die and the life that I have inside of me me I can divide myself into a group of people and it's me like God say it's me I can divide myself Jesus is fixing to say I'm going to divide myself into a group of people this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come that's why it's important to take communion it's an ordinance that's never been done away with that's the first thing we're going to do when we get to the manage supper we're going to take communion wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily you got something in your heart in your mind shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself you can literally clean your slate today hello somebody you can clean your slate by a prayer of repentance and God will never remember it no more that's right sometimes we don't know the power of repentance am you just don't know the power power of repentance yet we all don't so anyway wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that he didn't say examine yourself and then leave the building so let him eat of the bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged why but we are judged we're chasing of the Lord if you judged yourself today you judge yourself unrighteous hello if you judged yourself I did this I did that I got this ought I don't believe this I got this I don't want to be here I don't amen but when we are judged we're chasing of our of not our neighbor we're chasen of the Lord who knows all things that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and Paul said the rest I'll set in order when I come so let's just for a few moments just a silent prayer clean the Slate ask forgiveness of your sins reconcile with Christ and let's move forward we ask these things in Jesus name amen Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father this bread has been made by hands Lord that that are Sanctified and knows how to make it knows what ordinance it is father and and has a recognition of what's going on not just just throw something in the oven and make it and hope it does right Lord this is an ordinance that is that's set up by you Lord and you told us what to do and we're doing it now father just sanctify this in Jesus name amen you always uh I do I wonder I said well who made the bread for the Lord's Supper Martha Mary Jesus I guess we'll know when we get there but it was made for a purpose right other than just having supper that's what he just said he said when you come to eat Terry and eat at home eat your food at home the Corinthians were taking all this and drinking and getting drunk and and eating uh lamb and whatever else and Paul said no y'all do that at home this is Solemn this is the breaking of the bread bread this is what Jesus told us to do right before he died he said do this in remembrance of me not remember that my stomach was hungry and I'm filling my stomach with food dear heavenly father thank you for this wine Lord It's Made for one person purpose not to get drunk not to party with not to do anything but one thing Lord is remember that when you held that cup up you said this is the New Testament in my blood so Lord as we raise this glass Lord may it be a new testament for all of us Lord may it be a new testimony that Lord you've done something in our life we've seen people's lives change we've seen healings taking the communion Lord and I pray that you would anoint this the communion wine father for the service of your people in Jesus name amen it's not just something that we it that it's not a something we do and say well we'll just do it and and and become a formality just as a gift were given to keep every to keep the church clean I believe this this is checking up time it gives us time to check up it gives you time to stand there for a few minutes and say you know some some some first Sundays somebody said in your mind you're going I've had a good month I've had a good month I don't know that I've made anybody mad pray for me that's 30 days but you feel satisfied that you've done the right thing that you've cleaned your slate up and we may have another we may have a bad slate come next November but at least we've cleaned it or not in December lord it's already November but at least we've had a checking up time amen and we can go forward and say Lord I've done you know what take him to task say Lord I've done what you told me to do and don't be mean don't be say I expect you but expect them to do something wonderful in your life cuz he told us to do this till he come he told us this was a new testament in his blood he told us this ordinance this one foot washing water baptism are the three major ones to do and we sure appreciate that that God sent a prophet to tell us that we don't need to eat gra drink grape juice cuz it gets old we don't need to put leavon and have loaf bread and crackers but made it with unle bread made with holy hands made by somebody that knows what they're doing that part I think we got right so let's just keep working on everything else come morning I'll walk by the river how peaceful I'll rest NE the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning is Glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long it won't be long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on you know we've I was talking to brother Isaac a couple days ago and he's he's trying to uh do a little service on the uh crucifixion in the days and all that and in history you know we we have 24-hour days right so do the Jews but it's not at midnight because the Bible says the evening and the morning was the first day day right so their new day starts at 6:00 p.m. soon as it get sun getting ready to go down 600 p.m. it starts a new day from that from 6 until 6 the next day 24 hours is uh would be Saturday Jesus was crucified he wasn't crucified on Saturday he was crucified on Friday he wasn't crucified on Thursday he was crucified on Friday cuz that's why they call it good Friday so 3 hour to 3 hour to 6 Hour 3 hours on the cross that's why that that um and you have to you kind have to wrap it around your head CU we always think 12 is is the next day well 6:00 the day you got crucified when it hit that six o' time that was the Sabbath that was Saturday ye even though they were in the Friday day that we would say Friday we would wait till midnight and it would be Saturday it started at 6:00 that's why Joseph of armas said we need to get his body down that's why they were so fast and get CU if not if it would have been 6:01 p.m. you don't work on the Sabbath he would have hung there until the first day of the week okay so before 6 o' he was off that cross and in a tomb so he died on Friday stayed in the grave on on Saturday resurrected on Sunday morning it's not three total full days but it was within three days Friday before 6:00 Saturday then Sunday morning first day of the week that's when the resurrection happened so thank God for a prophet and thank God for just some history that'll tell us that that their day starts at 6:00 all right so let's take communion thank you Lord cuz it is a little confusing I told him I said find a chart draw you draw you a chart draw you a day chart you know and he sent it to me just a little while ago but just pray for them they they are they're doing well as a family and as a church group they're doing all right and I'm glad that we can that brother Aaron and him had a chance to go up and be with them and uh if anybody else wants to go up and be with them sure go right ahead cuz uh I think they got they got a hunger and a Zeal for God and U and they got a lot of uh adversity but we are made better with adversity we are made better with trial s and tribulations ain't that what the Bible says the footsteps of a righteous man order the Lord and He will have trouble he will have trouble I promise you he will so let's read the foot washing scripture and then we'll we'll continue on God bless you thank you for for being tentative today supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and he went to God I hope we realize that after he took communion he realized he come from God and went to God you did you get a revelation of that should happen to you same way he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a tow and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to W him with a towel where withth he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said 'lord do thou wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now he didn't say you'd never know it he saidou won't know it now but Thou shalt know Hereafter when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost he understood amen Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter said Lord not only my feet but also my hands not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said he that is washed he is not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for in you who should betray him he was the only one in that room that knew that nobody else knew that Judas was a betrayer they loved Judas they liked him he did all the work for him he had the money and he did all the work and he was went out pay for the food but he was betraying Jesus all the time for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment was sit down he said unto them know you what I have done to you question mark you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your lord Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that has sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for the service today Lord I pray that you Quicken a revelation to each one of our heart father that we'll realize that we're heading toward the end father here and it's time for us to sharpen up get a little bit more excitement about the word of God lord I pray that you'll help me to do that Lord and Lord I pray that you'd help each one here father that you'll bless each one Lord give them spiritual Revelation Lord more than anything Reveal Your word to them Father I ask your blessings in Jesus name amen God bless you you're dismissed sisters be ready RIT downstairs
