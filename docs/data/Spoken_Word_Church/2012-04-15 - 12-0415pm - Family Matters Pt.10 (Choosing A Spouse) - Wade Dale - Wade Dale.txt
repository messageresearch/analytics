turned my mic on it Michael will that help that better how about that well okay it's only for recording purposes you can hear me right you can say that a little bit lower all right let's turn to the book of Ephesians and let's get into a subject then I just love that's choosing a spouse courtship everybody remember that yes the older one said what no you know what that's something you'll never forget that's right amen you'll never forget the courtship Dave same way with the Lord growing up with the Lord you'll never ever forget the courtship time right never forget that time that the Lord spoke to your heart and you've got to know him real well and then you come to reside in your heart and do him even better everybody remembers that part of their life some of the things that we remember in our marriage we don't want to remember but the courtship part that's the part I love well here we go in Ephesians 5 verse 28-31 by way of announcement just remember again the ones out in Kansas they're all okay um everything's fine with them after the second service today we'll have brother Dale a birthday party downstairs we have cake and ice cream no party favor but if you brought him a gift or anything you can you can get time but tomorrow is just 72nd birthday so we thank God that large gave him 72 good strong looking out with all of us is enough amen okay all right I'll remember all the other announcements June 14 15 16th though really remember that Father's Day camping trip will be getting all the specifics together and be telling you weren't exactly to bring or when to come but we sure would like for everybody last year we had about 25 adults and kids um males and this year we're looking forward to having some more because it's grown every year even if you don't fish they come up and just sit around brother Tony came up there last year and sat around and had fun you know we all even if you don't fish you can always sit around the campfire we have marshmallows and sure do have a lot to eat on Friday night we'll take all of our fish and and uh and put them on the on the fryer and fry some fish and have some hush puppies and some and some slaws so yeah it's uh it's just a good time to Fellowship good time to get away good time to do like what we've been talking about this morning be together as a family because that's what we enjoy to do so and also remember um some were talking downstairs um between Services about the Financial Peace University course um starting in July the 15th uh if you have anybody that wants to come you can bring somebody but I really need to know starting today and and on for a few more months who wants to take it because we got to order the kits for it and the kits are cheaper now so we get a discount on them for buying them through the church anyway but we get a real big discount actually today is the last day for ordering with free shipping but we can get through some of that I call the director at the uh at the uh at Dave Ramsey's office there and ask him talk to him about it he said he would work out something for us so um everybody's having fun in the class and and everybody's got a plan now right right assistant Canard we have a plan we have a budget we have a place to put our money and being a Christian is not bad having money it's just a love of money it's the root of all evil not having money okay you gotta have money to do uh to have your economy and you gotta have money God takes a little bit of it to run his economy with he just asked you to take care of your 90 like he takes care of his team that's right so that's what it is it's all his he just gives you 90 back and he but he can do more with 10 than we can do with 90. so there's something there must be something in there that we can do different that'll help us to to make our 90 become a member of Jesus told the man he said here take this money and invest it he got on to the one that didn't invest it right remember the guy that buried it in the ground he got on to that guy did you put your money in the ground right okay if he'll ever let me in his yard with that with my Dole finder and a metal detector I'll see what I can find back there Ephesians five all right let's bow our heads but really if you want to do that it'll be after service probably from like five to seven right after church I don't want to interrupt church at all but most of y'all hang around here till 5 30 anyway so we could start right after church is over probably starting July about July the 15th and also be thinking about going to uh Wichita in the month of May which is Memorial Day weekend we're gonna try to leave maybe Thursday night out that'll be our last class for the Dave Randy class that'll be the last one we'll probably try to leave that evening the next Sunday so we'll be there for a little bit of time just keep us in your prayers kind of like we got a plan you know we planned out the year so we know what's going on it's Ephesians five dear heavenly father we pray Lord that what we say Lord will be pleasing to you we pray Lord that you will not be one Lord that stands aside but be the active participant in the service take these lips with Clay Lord and speak to the people you've already give us a thought to to speak on but Lord may you take that thought and Quicken it to the hearts and lives of the people Lord we pray that you just be with us now take care of us lead us and guide us by your truth Lord if it's not word based father we don't want it we want it to be word based and you gave us a prophet as we say read between the lines of this love letter that you sent Lauren it you give us the opportunity to live down here in human flesh and to reflect you and Lord we pray that that's what we'll do as we'll reflect you Lord and as we're speaking today about choosing a bride may we also in our inner being may we realize that that you once chose a bride and look for a certain character in the spiritual sense and Lord I pray that we'll fit that mold pray that we'll put on the garments that you want Lord to be pleasing to you father but even Lord as we're here in the natural Lord the choosing of a bride in the natural Lord is a very important thing we pray now that as we speak Lord we know that a lot of us have already walked down that that pathway and and already have the spouse Lord that that you gave us but father they summoned the building that doesn't have a spouse Warren and we we truly want them to have and I'm honestly from My Heart Lord I want them to have uh just a full rich Christian Life with their spouse I want to be close Lord and not have not have the problems that this world sees of divorce and and all this running around and junk that they do here Lord that's the world but father you gave us a Bible you gave us the Holy Spirit you gave us minister of Lord that that can take the word and deliver it to the people as you want it to be delivered that they will understand it and know how to live Lord that they'll have Holy Ghost knowledge when they make their choices Lawrence just bless us now and take care of us forgive us of our sins thank you for blessing the ones out in Oklahoma and Kansas Lord that are out there in the paths of those tornadoes that you moved to out of the landlord afraid that you just bless us now and take care of us in the furthermore this service Jesus name we pray amen Ephesians 5 28-31 so like men to love their wives as their own bodies now we're backing up a little bit but just continue the thought he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man I ever hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherishes it now we're looking for a spouse all right we're choosing a spouse this afternoon for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourish you and cherishes ongoing t-h right even as the Lord the church because he does the same thing with us right he nourishes us and cherishes for we are members of his body of his fleshing of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh now let's go to Matthew 19. and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female one in one one male one female right right and said for this cause shall man leave his father and mother shall cleave to his wife that doesn't say leave your wife and clean for your mother and father all right all right and for this call shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put us under you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word we come to a time that tonight we want to to dwell a little bit on choosing a spouse and the things that we do and the planning because outside of your salvation this is probably the most important decision you'll ever make in your life amen because no other decision in your life outside of Salvation is from Death do you part right there you know you can join to a friend or you can join to an acquaintance and you can you can hunt and fish with them for 20 years but somewhere down the line your part somewhere down the line they'll get married you'll get married or somewhere down the line this will happen and this will happen so I'm going to move because of a job somebody will do this somebody will do that but when you choose your spouse it is for Eternal tea it is till death do you part here and we read this morning where even into the eternities the husband and wife the family unit will still be there in eternity right all right so now look it's an important decision it's not something that you need to take lightly and I know we got some young people in here need to think about this that door's not looking it's anything that brother Tim cook number one all right let's get started listen to this what's your brother Brandon brings this out now there's three things we're going to look at this afternoon probably just two of them we're not gonna We're not gonna run too lengthy this afternoon we'll probably finish up next Sunday with two Services next Sunday and we'll we'll be finished either not in the decision that you and your girlfriend has to make whether you're going to live together or get married or not there's all kinds of decisions to be made in life and they'll linger along for a certain period and then a time comes where it's got to be settled that's the last time it's got to happen now one way or the other all right number two choosing of a brat read that book that book we're going to use a lot of quotes in today brother Brown really covers the natural and the spiritual part of choosing them right there's another choice that we have in life that's a life's companion a young man or a young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it I didn't say the young woman asked the young man yeah it's the young man asks the young woman right right so young men here we are at the role again of headship you're the one that's got to make the choice first then you ask her and she has the ability to say yes or no that's like Dan said the other night if she says young ladies if you don't think that's the right guy all you gotta do is say no or not right now or you're not the one that's all you got to say and that's it that doesn't constitute that you're married to the person I don't care if he camps out on your doorstep throws rocks through your window climbs up in your you know tries to climb up in your room I don't care if you say no man that means no right all right no means no and I'm not looking in the camera cambo's behind the camera all right brother Tim was going to be he's setting the highest today he's he's going to fall asleep or he's fainted I think that's probably what it is but the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it now we've got young sisters in here too but it's still a choice on both sides but the male has to initiate both man and woman they have a right to Choice also you have a choice as a Christian all right number three in choosing a variety again but you know you have to plan watch this these are the three things we're going to look at today plan look and pray plan look Pray when you're choosing when we see by this the Word of Promise she's a bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character it reflects what's in him now could you imagine a man feel with the Holy Ghost takes something like that to be a wife now what he's doing is he's talking about Ahab and Jezebel yeah congregation says no I just don't see it brother now maybe I'm just an old crank but you know I just can't understand that see notice where it's going to reflect what's in him she is going to help him make his future home amen amen all right so this is the choice the man has got to do these three things first then you sisters you have to do the same thing there's not a problem I you know you can say what you want to do about me but I do things and I break things down and and I try to do things in life with a plan I said I'll try there's a lot of some things that you have to do kind of spontaneously but there's some things that you can't help but if you'll make a plan like I said this morning about planning if you don't have a plan then your plan is going to always fail don't have a plan Brothers sit down and say look I want to be able to support like bro Tim said yesterday we were talking about it or maybe it was a few days ago he said I'm not financially stable enough yet that's good that's the planer he's honest with that so that that he said hey I am not financially able to have a spouse at this time right now unless I want her to work too yeah that's the same way you got to do your Sisters You Brought young Brothers you got to look at it and say hey if I'm gonna plan to be the only breadwinner I gotta make x amount of dollars to support me and my family right you know like brother Ryan does that brother Ryan he he works and sister Gabby done that's wonderful made a plan for that yeah plan worked at least he made a plan instead of going into this thing just you know just oh you know loves blind like the guy said one time love is blind but it don't have to be deaf and dumb I like that Love's blind but doesn't have to be deaf and dumb and that's correct Love is Blind but you still gotta look and see what you're getting into plan look and pray when you're choosing but we see by this a Word of Promise be the bride that a man would choose is going to reflect his character see that's another thing we'll get into and maybe maybe next Sunday but she's going to reflect his character if she doesn't they're no two they're not 20. they compliment remember I talked about the complimenting the sister the the wife compliments the husband right all right very complimentary or accessorized all right planning looking and praying let's start right here this is not just a sometime or convenient decision a lot of times we see that it's a convenient decision we're going to get married we're just going to leave because we I don't want to be at home I don't want to feel left out have a plan sisters if you're going to go to school say all right I got four years plan Brothers okay I'm gonna go to school I'm gonna get a good job there's four years I'm not going to play around we'll read it in just a little while brother Brown said don't play around right don't play around with just dating anybody and just accepting anything that comes along no have a plan right now I know a lot of Us wish we had had this teaching before we started so that's the way it was going to be anyway brother I'm sorry it's burden we have to wait but some sometimes look how many times have you seen this though convenience get married or date out of convenience no if you're going to take four years of school Forget About a Boy for it for four years you okay you're young you're not losing out on anything right you know I hate that word play the field there's no PL and then if you're a Christian and you are abide by the word of God and we believe the prophet's message because I'm going to keep reading the quotes now through here there's no playing around time no playing around time okay but you need to have a plan right right if you have a plan that'll take care of that playing around stuff then when you get serious and we you plan first then you start looking planning looking and praying not planning looking go planning looking and praying you know that there's nothing about loving that you learn to love remember I'll read your quote in just a minute this is not just a sometime or convenient decision outside of salvation it is the most important decision you'll ever make if you fail to plan your plan will fail every time so young kids you can think we're old foggy or not but let me tell you something it's just like this you need to listen to the older people you've heard the same been there done that got a t-shirt for it we've been there done that had you for it right we've been there done that and you're you're the result of it anything that comes up you think Mom and Dad's old fogy basically everything works exactly the same businesses I don't care what business you're in you got income outgo profit that's it I don't care what kind of business yeah I don't care if you're selling dope same thing you buy it you're selling for a price and you make a profit cause ain't playing with a plan this plan is going to work every time if you'll plan something according to the word of God a plan helps you make a decision and Maps out how you will accomplish it with the resources we have today this is my quote with the resources that we have today as far as the message of the hour the knowledge by the Holy Ghost through parents and the ministry we should be able to make sound decisions about our choices now look we can and will help that's me I'll help you any way I can but parents you're supposed to be the first ones all right but we can and we'll give help all right so let's start with the planning phase what does the word plan mean a method of arranging in advance that's the whole key plan in advance you don't plan during the battle right you improvise during the battle you planned before the battle happens and God's laid to plan out already for us remember it's a Plan of Redemption but we have a plan down here on Earth and we've got goals that we've got to accomplish or that we want to accomplish you say put that in the scripture Paul was a pretty good guy about plans like this Colossians 3 2 set your affection point a plan set your affections on things above not on things in the Earth First Corinthians 9 24. know ye that they which run in a race run all but one receive at the prize so run that you may obtain right make a plan so that you can make it and every man that strives for the Mastery is temperate in all things camper it right every man that strives for the mastery I was talking to brother Bob in the bank we were talking about a certain things and this gets to me easier to to to get in a channel but it's a match it's not a Mastery of the word of God but it's a Mastery to let God take over and sit at home and say God what how do you put this together take these big pieces of puzzle that everybody's got these questions about and bring it together and make a picture out of it that's my job the picture of the puzzle pieces are already there amen the words already there it's just taking somebody to take it and pull it together and be temperate what hold your temper or be temperate in all things now they do it to what obtain a correctable crown right but we do it in an incredible crown I therefore so run not as uncertainly that certainly means you don't have a plan yeah he runs with certainty possible Paul's saying right so fine I not his one that beat at the air right he had a plan Paul had a plan a plan in life let's go to Colossians we got the Colossians 3 and Corinthians let's go to quote number four excuse me of a bride and after spiritual or the natural attack of the spiritual then the choosing of her bride and the natural is the type of choosing a bride be bride in the spiritual now it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife a man but the vows here is unto death do we part we understand that right if we would have all held to that right yeah things might not have been right as bad as they are but we have grief that God's give us right amen because we're all guilty that's how we should keep it and you take that vow before God that only death will separate you because I mean Daddy and I were talking going down the road the other day I actually in Christianity there's no there's nothing called marriage and divorce right in Christianity there's no divorce right right the Bible don't tell you it's okay to divorce it never has told you you get divorce except because if your wife is unclean the only right it's fornication the only thing that the bible really says you can not marry her or put her ways because she was unclean that's the only thing right so really in true Christianity if you got a born-again a woman and a born-again man that's what God wants amen he puts him two together and they're one right they don't divorce never will divorce right they'll work their problems out but if you'll maybe if we can plan and then look and then pray and then start the dating process like we're going to go through here maybe we can knock out some of that because look that's how we should keep it and you take that bow before God that only death will separate you and I think we shouldn't a man in his right mind that's planning a future put the word planning and planning and see how many times brother Branham talks about playing you think I'm crazy so well you're just being too much like school no we need we need a plan right planning a future that he should choose that wife very carefully be careful what you're doing in a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband he corrected himself because she doesn't choose she accepts the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's doing it especially in these days a man should look and pray because you should think and pray before he chooses the wife until right here says I think today we got so many divorce cases now that we lead the world in America in divorce cases how many times I mean I'm not married anybody that's this got a divorce but how many times the the people lie to each other yeah yeah I'm talking to people lie to each other do you take this yes do you take this through death do you part yes I do yes I do six months later than divorced somebody lied yeah somebody told him to lie and that vowel was before who God not the people before God and the people I'm sorry without him as a Christian Nation what a reproach our divorce court I think the reason of it is is because that man has gotten away from God and women have gone away from God and we find out if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter now I just look at a pretty set of eyes okay our big strong shoulders are such as that or some other worldly affection but would look first to God and say God is this your what amen plan and if we would study study what we're doing we're going to get married when we choose our wife our husband if you'd study it over a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life but now what the problem is now is they they figure they don't want to work their problems out so they just this is the book it's just divorce I can't work my problem now let's just divorce it's so easy we can go down like 3.99 they'll give you a toaster you get a divorce I mean it's all over the Billboards remember it's all over the billboard 3.99 uncontested divorce remember the vowel is until death do we part and he could ruin his life by making the wrong choice but if he knows what he making the wrong choice and just marrying a woman that isn't fit to be a wife and he does it anyway then it's the man's fault it's his fault if the woman takes the husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you then that's your own fault right after you know what's right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through all right next one statue of a perfect man I believe that God gives us a mate that's true and we become part of each other that's right and for a man gets married he should think these things over study it right studying next one perseverance when a man takes his wife he's got to base his faith in that woman she's got to base her faith in that man some reason to make the goal of Life goal plan if he doesn't then there's something wrong and it won't work you've got to have faith and what better to have faith in than the word of God all right number seven leadership you have a choice of conduct how you conduct yourself that's up to you you have a choice of life you go out and take your wife you want to take a wife you want to take one that's complementary to your to what you want your plan your future home to be could you imagine a man a Christian man going out and taking one of these modern ricketters for a while huh could you imagine what's the man thinking about what kind of a home is he going to have if he takes a striptease a burlesque off the street out here a street prostitute oh you say now wait a minute how does she dress herself he's asking please see wear shorts and things she's a street prostitute oh you say now brother Brandon I want them little old tight skirt so like you poured into them great prostitute we got to be careful amen our wives wear that and present theirself out and found it you know what that makes me right you purchased you and you are responsible for it right amen sorry the message is out it's the word of God it's something we got to live by all right let's go to number eight before we read this he's talking about this he said I ain't man for a little bitty kids to get married because he his mom and dad got married at 15 and 18 and 15. that's almost when Mom and Daddy got married almost so oh but it says don't amen for little bitty kids to get married now let your father and mother they know they're Christians they can instruct you daughter comes son comes and says I want to get married please at least talk to your mother and father about it um I I love the way they do it in Jamaica if they know that that John's looking at Mary what do they do brother Keith brings John and Mary up in front of the church he says I want the whole church to know that John and Mary are thinking planning looking at each other not dating or anything but they are kind of looking at each other and the whole church it's a whole big set of eyes and them people can't get away from them he got you know 150 people in his church but he brings them before the church and then they pray and then he says you watch them we are to watch over them until they get married will that stop some of this ain't Summer Girls even in a message you'd have to bring them up 14 or 15 times that's not good that's not good because when it when John is looking at Mary 99.99 of the time John and Mary get married because they've already that everybody's praying everybody's in the right frame of mind they watch John and Mary and make sure John and Mary doesn't do anything wrong because we know this question getting away sometime been there done that we know that and young people we've all been that way amen that's what I thought I was hoping some of you were still human but talk to your mother and your father if they're Christians especially make an instruction because remember just like I said been there done that we've been through all the things there is no new thing that you kids are going to go through that we haven't been through nothing there's nothing you can say well it's this and it's no it's nothing we've all been through it right all right so now your choice reveals what your real goal is it shows your real plan and your real character let's read this number nine do you think of a brain so you must make the right choice again the kind of woman that a man would choose his ambition and his character right if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for a wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside watching what he married three times huh and he talks about Boogie Woogie music and said you're Christian got Pinups in your house and all that stuff what say if he would marry a chorus girl and what if we marry a sex queen or just a pretty murder get it it reflects it shows what he has in his mind of what his future home is going to be because he took her to raise his children by like what we're talking about this morning raising children's part of it and whatever she is that's the way she'll raise those children right like I said before the the girl that had a little baby with a cigarette well baby picked the cigarette up because Mom and Daddy smoke right he just done what I mean I hope she didn't whip the kid I'd whip her okay why are you with the kids for something you have done right man you say bad words at home and your kid pops out with a bad word you got it from you all right make the paddle reach back if you can and do it for yourself right all right see it reflects what's in the man a man that takes a woman like that shows just what he's thinking of the future could you imagine a Christian doing a thing like that no sir I could not true Christian will not look for such beauty queens of course girls and sex Queens he'll look for Christian character amen now look he's being honest now you can't have all things there might be one girl that's real pretty another girl maybe she her statue looks better than this one and you might have a sacrifice one for the other but if she's not the stature of a lady of a woman and she I don't care whether she's pretty or not you better look at her character right whether she's pretty or not pretty now for it is becoming if a Christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine Born Again wife like I said this morning not just somebody that says there in the message right oh there's too much gold on around this message that people say they're in the message and I doubt it very seriously but if you're born again there's the difference all right regardless of what she looks like it's what she is what makes her and then again that reflects his own Godly character and reflects what's in his mind and what's going to be in the future how many times have you seen this people maybe somebody just cause the wife's beautiful or or the woman's beautiful and then it never lasts and what's going to be going to be his Queens what could he expect what kind of a home could a man expect to have a female is a girl that ain't got enough morals about her to stay home and take care of the house and wants to work out at somebody's office what kind of a housekeeper will she be you'll have babysitters and everything else true right true because we've all been through that all right so now that was the planning stage plan look guys girls young people write down what you want write down your goals put them on a piece of paper stick them in your bill folder stick them in your purse and say God this is kind of man I'm looking for right here this is kind of man some kind of character some kind of good not any thickly good looking but good character because character will always hold good looks will not always be there I promise all right so now that was the planning stage now let's see here about the looking once you know your goal and you plan it in a way according to the scripture the next step is to look looking through spiritual eyes for things that fulfill your goal so you make your goals first everybody got that okay you make your goals first I hope make your goals first you got a good head on shoulder you'd like your daddy listen when I see two people come together and I'm not talking about hope now when I see two people come together though and you just think and you just sit and you think man it's the eclipse to me that's a beautiful picture because that's what God's looking for he's not looking for you to have an ill attitude he's not looking for you to he's looking for your character that's what he comes to look he loves you because of you he don't love you just because you act like somebody else he loves you because God loves that character you have he stuck something into that genetic strain from this one to this one to this one to this one to this one to this and to get you here looking through spiritual eyes for things that fulfill your goal all right now let's go to questions and answers listen to this I've got to know what I'm doing before I can have faith in what I'm doing right mind you marry your wife you had faith in her you had tried her watched her looking remember we're looking now we're looking can't help but look we're looking you had tried her watched her saying where she come from we'll get into that in a little while he's talking about the family or background who she was that's the way with the scriptures with God same thing all right let's go to number 11. how would you go and pick out you gentlemen young man here young man here young lady here would you walk out on the street and pick up a woman and just marry her just because you walked out and picked her up just because she was a woman in other words I don't have much thoughts of your conception I'm sure but see first you got to know something about her where she comes from her character lashed away with a woman to her husband the same way you must think of those things because it's your lifetime companionship and this is our eighth of eternal life with God right all right we must know what we're looking for what do you need to be looking for a real believer somebody that really don't just believe a message but lives it doesn't just live in front of his parents lives in front of you you can tell you can tell somebody's born again or not just give a few minutes and we can find out all right number 12. look for something that's real and genuine a lot of stuff a lot of put on goes around look for real and genuine that's why you need to look looking through spiritual lives not looking through the lust Veil that we look through a lot we need to be looking through a holy ghost bail all right see if that girl's born again if she isn't saved have nothing to do with her now that's what I'm telling you if you're going to make a plan that in four years you're not going to do anything in four years but go to school girls or guys there's no playing around with unbelievers shouldn't be anyway yeah no unbelievers shouldn't be playing around with Believers for four years just get yourself in trouble if she isn't saved and have nothing to do with her and do the same thing by a young man the trouble our ranks of Christians today is breaking down and marrying and air marrying and it's such a mess so there's nothing could straighten it out we're rapping for judgment that's your profit all right Nick I said that may be all right let's read the first part of it he's a paradox my father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in the pool said I know my mind's come to Christ I said that may be all right all the outward motions hello all the outward motions right right he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he is regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectually he's trying his best to overcome it and he can't do it no words in humanly you can't overcome your whatever your mom and dad give you right you can't overcome that by yourself that's where daddy said you said well I can't help it because my mom was that way yeah you can he's fixing to tell you yeah yeah and yet in his intellectuals he is trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born in the spirit of God all right next one 14. young man getting married marry some girl that don't believe or some girl marrying a boy that don't believe oh my God this is for y'all except with your parents actually it won't go on young man getting married marry some girl that don't believe or some young girl marrying a boy that don't believe don't you do it don't do it just do not do it right there's enough Godly women and there's enough Godly men around no he's got somebody for you don't go out and try to push the issue because remember it's still your free moral agency you can override all that like Janet and I were talking a few minutes ago even though you put him in church even though you put them through school even though you can do all the things we did this morning they still got to make their own choice this is not an automatic thing brother Brown said he want an automatic fan right but at least they can't come back to you and say you didn't tell me right now if you raise them right and you give them the right things and the right path to go on if they go away it's nobody's fault but theirs but like Mom said it's always that scripture that comes back that's when they're older raise up a child in the way it should go and when he's older he'll not depart from him did say he went to park promo during the stupid years oh no y'all have stupid ears I mean we all had stupid years some just run longer than others some of you went into overtime double overtime main triple over time but thank God what my background brought me right back to where I'm at now and then God can use somebody like that same way with you and all of you I don't care how cute he is or how cute she is or what those big eyes she's got they'll all fade out one of these days they'll have to wear glasses but brother your soul is going to live forever you be careful what you're doing she ain't a real believer or him a real believer don't you yoke yourself up like that stay away from such it'll cause you trouble down the road now listen to profit listen to brother Dale listen to brother Wayne it will cause you problems right yeah you may think oh well my parents are so strict and this girl is something no please please please please please because you're gonna always come back you know what I told my kids I said y'all want to be famous you want to be famous you want to be famous do a hundred percent of what your parents tell you to do right you'll be famous they'll have you on Oprah they'll have you on all these shows if you can walk in and sit down and go I did everything that my mom and dad told me to do you be rich famous you want to get famous you ain't going to play baseball you ain't got to play all this other stuff just say I did everything my parents said to do you'll be an anomaly you'll be the only two people in the world that's how you get famous do exactly what your parents say well if you don't do a little bit of what we're trying to tell you now you'll do better than most but you be careful what you're doing she ain't a real believer him a real believer don't you yoke yourself up like that stay away from sex it'll cause you trouble down the road now I wanted to clear up something here before we go to the next quote some of us some of us chose wives outside of the church but remember I wasn't serving the lord either so it wasn't that I it wasn't that I chose somebody that was an unbeliever no I was an unbeliever right okay damn it shows Lisa Lisa wasn't part of the you know the message of Boyd and Janet there's a bunch of them in here so I'm not saying that 100 of the time you've got to marry believer but let me tell you something getting closer to the end that we are now right you better marry a Believer because you don't have time to make a mistake there's no time to make mistakes now we made our mistakes in the past we're trying to get you to not go down that path don't go down that road we went down listen to what we're telling you stay away from such it'll cause you trouble down the road now the road's getting shorter there the end was right here and we were here now the end's right here right that's right but listen I want you young kids to be happy that's what I said when when I see two people fall in love and do everything exactly like they're supposed to do do it by the word of God and they're both serving the lord and they get married and just keep serving the lord to me that's the most beautiful picture beautiful picture you show me anything in the world show me two people that are just absolutely in love they come to church they serve God they have children they have a family he's made a plan they've come together with that plan and they've decided that the wife's either going to stay home and she's going to work or we're not going to have kids for a few years that don't really matter to me I have a plan though have a plan play on something all right but it'll cause you trouble down the road if you don't all right next telling you people this is life lessons that's right probably even maybe falling asleep but it's a life lesson it's important amen it's important to help the people around us can two walk together hear scripture can two walk together except they'd be agreed agree it's to meet at a certain place now don't look for somebody that's easily agreeable with everything honey whatever you think you can bring three women home tonight that's okay honey no that's not what that's saying that says don't look for somebody that's easily agreeable with everything but do agree to walk together and have the same goal man all right women think a little different than men men think a little different than women but if you've got the same common goal you two can walk together that note what it says you know except they'd be agreed but not a hundred percent agree you're not going to be in your human being right like I said just don't look for somebody that's just so easily agreeable no come together and decide you know what's the best thing to do talk talk I'd rather you talk than to worry about the complications later these things you didn't talk about before you get married young men young ladies if you find somebody that you're that you're agreeable with and that you're past the looking stage and past the praying stage and going into the courtship stage then then you got to sit down and talk talk about the thing talk about life it does not bother me that when two people are are totally hooked up together plan looked pray they look like they're going to get married talk about life do you want to have kids do you not want to have kids when you get two born-again people it doesn't bother you get that out in the world and that's that's just Just A Sign you understand what I'm saying but no sit there and plan your life out just like brother Brown's telling if you make a mistake now it's going to follow you all went through life right there's a lot of us sitting in here the same way it's followed us through life the mistakes we've made let's go to Ephesians 5. I think that's the next one in it yes for you were sometimes Darkness but now you are light in the Lord walk as children of the light like I said you're not in darkness anymore kids we have no clue to cover us and say well we didn't understand no I'm trying to make it just as simple as we can make it that we are humans living in human bodies doing human things God wants us to have a spouse God wants us to have a spouse a help meet to me that's the perfect type of you know like Christ in the church he wants us to have a family unit that's what he wants we we kind of I think we kind of got that basis this morning so let's go to the next first John 1. but if you walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin right you walk right woman walk right you walk right together you're right in line with Fellowship Godly Fellowship not the other kind of Fellowship all right now look let's look at this one right here just a second character you know what character is let's go to number 15. listen to this what he said choosing a bride this is in Los Angeles California that's always stuck with me now what he done remember he married the one on the hill in the mansion and the one we talked about the other day and he married the one that lived in a box car this is what he said from that that's always stuck with me of how that was one chose a beautiful girl the other one chose character now that's the only way you could choose first look for character and then if you love her fine but now look now this I put this in here look guys first Adam he didn't have choice for his wife God just gave it to him all right he didn't get a choice Don just made him one and he didn't get to choose her so we found out that she led him astray from God's word he didn't get to pray over the matter he isn't like you and I he didn't get a choice but you and I get a choice right all right let's go to numbers let's go to 16. Abraham had to do it and call those things which were not as though they were and he believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness what we need today is a wishbone out of a backbone putting Christianity right it's there the thing we need is some born-again Christians men and women who will when they see trouble Rising I'm talking about us today when we see trouble Rising not slip off fall off and go hide behind the corner somewhere not run out this way be partakers of it but a man and woman who will stand and show their color even your friends will appreciate you more if you will do that right you know Dad's exactly right and I'm I don't get this wrong I didn't I didn't have relations with a lot of girls in high school and all but I did have a friendly relationship with all of them and I knew the ones that were good and I knew the ones that were bad and I had a whole lot more respect for the ones that were good than I did for them that was bad isn't that true grown-ups don't get a reputation it'll follow you all through life all right so look even your friends will appreciate you more if you'll do it what stand for something stand for your plan in other words do what you're supposed to do what man is he that don't appreciate a woman made of mud and dog with tadpoles Laramie he could only have said that he got by with it nobody would nobody just last name probably never be exactly as she may be let her be the lady and character enough to stand for a woman morals any man that comes along will take off his hat to her if he's got an ounce of man in him and if man face that being a fallen Son of God what will God himself say to a man who will stand up for his conviction call right right call wrong wrong right all right Amen to that right we must be committed and loyal necess till death do us part watch this is what I always look at I'm not watching them I watch people I watch how people handle a situation even even all of us in life now watch how you handle a situation so right something wrong if you don't ask my opinion I don't give it but if you ask my opinion you know what you're gonna get my opinion all right but guys and girls watch how that person handles the situation because God may put you in a situation sometime just to let that man remember brother Brown said God would let somebody say something to you he's talking about adults now let some let somebody say something to you different or wrong just to see how you react right you want me to find that quote that's what he's saying he'll let somebody cross your path and say something about you or against you just to see how you'll react same way with here if you've got an ounce of man in him if a man if a man face it face that being a fallen Son of God what would God himself say to a man who'll stand up for his convictions come on right right wrong wrong all right let's go to the next one 17. we will get finished I'm gonna start on we'll do the looking and then we'll start on the praying y'all pray for next Sunday because that's we'll start into the praying part now how I would like to border here just for a few minutes as it was and getting into the core of this on Mother Goose City there is preaching on the invasion of the United States in 1954. and when a man starts to get married the type of a girl woman that he it it's more than just lucky Beauty you've got to get somebody both soul and body going together amen somebody that's really going to be your friend and Powell that will stick with you through thick and thin right he doesn't just say no death to us part but it says in sickness and in hell for richer and for poorer do you really realize that's right do you really realize what you're saying when you make that bow it doesn't really matter how poor we get I'm staying with him doesn't matter how rich we get I'm staying with him doesn't matter if I have to work and he can't work and he's disabled and we live off beans that's what you're saying amen but it's so convenient in the in the world and the United States has made it so easy to go well they said I'll find me a well one or he's poor I'll find me a rich one that's one of the divorce courts are the way they are but you won't get too godly people to do that I've seen people too thick and thin they'll that your husband will go down and the wife will just pick up or a wife will go down the husband to pick up you know who's got Garden who doesn't because it shows right okay now look this right here I'm glad brother Bob this is kind of at the end of everything you notice I hadn't said a thing about love planning looking praying when you get past to the looking part and start praying because you want when we start in the praying part you'll see how you're praying that you'll fall in love with this person okay that's what you're going to pray you're going to pray that you're going to fall in love with this person right but you got to look for the right one looking for Real Love Is Right Here toward the end because what if most of us thought was this is what most of us thought was the only thing to look for well just if you love them marry them you don't know one thing about love right until you've experienced all these other things right love is a ongoing process same way with God you don't really when you're born again know the love of God do you do you know the true love of God we'll never know the true love of God even when we get into eternity so we're just gonna like I told them the other day brother Brandon said it's like a little button a little button comes into your soul that's the earnest of your inheritance that's your eternal life that's going to get you to heaven that's just the button that ain't the whole shirt that's just the button all right this is what most of us thought was the only thing to look for it is not the first thing to look for but it's important do not look for what the world calls love because the world's love is what selfish and self-centered I I mean me do it for me that'll make me feel good real love does one thing folks it gives you remember the you remember the illustration where brother Brown said Real Love was that if you really love the person but she told you one day said you know what I think I could love this person over here a little bit better and for you to look at that person and say well I want you to have the best in life and back off that's true blood that's right it'd be hard to do tell you what I love June but if you told me that I probably went crazy but I wasn't born again but being born again you can say hey I want the best for her let's don't be selfish and say well what's the best for me no what's the best for that person all right real love gives of itself you really cannot explain true love but there's one key I'll read your quote with brother when I'm saying that faith is the key amen you say faith in love brother Brown is going to tell you faith is love right and love his face number 18. this is for you young girls that's not married and you Mullins when you meet that girl that you love love and that's just all there is to it or you love him and that you don't care whether he's handsome or whether he's not handsome or whether she's pretty or not pretty that doesn't matter but you love them just the same now you better watch kind of hold around close there because you're getting close to home but now look he said the marriage-based outside of that is sure to fall or it'll never be successful they'll never be happy all right now let's go to 19. absolutely you when you get married there had to wind back through your mind something till you hit that typos you get that when you got married there had to in other words you have to think back why did all this happen something till you hit that typos and it should have been love for your wife or your husband well maybe as pretty as gun's life or she well she not the this that but there is something about her that that you it strikes you you say she might not be as pretty as the other or he might not be as handsome as the other but there has to be an absolute without an absolute there's another person involved without an absolute there's another person involved there has to be an absolute there that that person is different and there's where you hold on to amen absolutely number twenty be finished in a minute roll it on up and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a God who is a very essence of love Faith and love work together here just like a young couple you take a young man and your woman and they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another how many times I've told you that you don't know each other that well you've done the best you could but you're learning they go along and begin to know one another more their heart begins to beat as one see there there yet they're not husband and wife oh you thought you thought about getting married no this is just a dating process man but their love binds them together and they have confidence in one another now if they really love one another really love and you know that this girl loves you and she knows that you love her You've Got Confidence faith in one another if you've got faith in one another if you didn't you'd better not marry them notice you got to have faith and you separate them and put one extreme South and one extreme North there's still that love that beats for one another what faith no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the Lord It's not trying to dodge hell but you love the Lord then you have faith in God see and it if you love him so faith and love does work together faith is the key of this true love right so now let's go to 21 and this this is the last part know the background of the person a man when he chooses his life companion he usually inquires of her life family right and so forth what family she out of and what's her background so forth we have to have something like that to give a basis you ask her now only thing he can take is her word that's all he can take and that's all she can take from him is his word and there's no other way all right so let's go to 22 and we'll be done right here last one I've got the noise I read this before I'm gonna read it again I've got to know what I'm doing before I can have faith in what I'm doing does that make sense right I gotta know what I'm doing before I have faith in it like I was telling you many times before um the reason we have fear is we don't know how something works amen I have fear of opening that box over there without all those electrical wires if somebody just pulled all the wires out and and threw the breakers everywhere and and they told me to put it together what there would a fear come upon me I walk out there in the shop and look at those guys putting those Motors together and there's Motor Parts laying everywhere well you think they're scared Jonathan put the motor together with a black with blinders on them right he had no fear because what he understands what he's doing if I was a master electrician I'd have no more fear of going over and putting all those things back together and they work then I would of anything else why the fear is gone yeah same way when you're choosing a wife or a spouse you gotta have faith I gotta know what I'm doing that's what I'm trying to teach you basically the young people learn about your person the person that you're looking at we're still in the looking state I've got to know what I'm doing before I can have faith in what I'm doing why'd you marry your wife you had faith in her you had tried her watched her seen what she come from and who she was I same way with the scripture with God that's the same way with God that's the same way we're talking about death until we understand death and we understand the change of the body not that it is to change the body but understand it change the body we'll have a fear right everybody's got a fear of dying I don't I don't see her yeah you do yeah you do because this unknown thing that we don't know anything about but through the prophet's message he's given us an ability to know what we're looking for right the word look when you say when you're somebody when you say look what does that mean you turn your attention to One Direction right right when somebody hollers look what's the first thing you do you look you try then if it's somebody points you ever walked in a room just started doing this ninety percent of the people in that room is going to go there's nothing up there but you say look and they're looking at it that's what I want to tell you look when you find somebody that you get your attention on really don't just look look with a spiritual understanding look with the planning and the praying we'll get into the praying next Sunday Lord willing let's stand so we go downstairs and have a little cake and ice cream but look to see in a Direction young people even us old people if we see people struggling help them out yeah amen help them out we've been there like I said we've been there we've done that I know this last night it's hard for them to listen sometimes but by the grace of God can find the right spouse amen you can you can make the right choice right you know why I put my faith in that because like I said God has purposed us to be this way that's where I look at life brother call it God's purpose has to be this way live have children have a family have a church family be able to understand what happens in life and to be understand what happens in the spiritual life and when you do that that you're well you're a well-rounded individual but you must have a plan right plan look and next Sunday we'll talk about praying you know the Lord amen amen I love him for what he's given us the grace he's given us Grace has got to be in all this when you put love when you say the word love to me that's great because he loved us give us Grace enough to love us in the way that we are and give us Grace and and that we didn't make the right choice at one time Henry amen we were out in the world we did the things in the world we didn't listen to God we didn't listen to our parents we listened to nothing but the devil and it's interrupted our life until this point right here you know I've always said let me say this before we sing I've always said and I know there's implications of marriage and divorce in the spiritual but even in natural God knew that as human beings if there was divorce there'd be two families they're all gonna be in struggle it's always going to be a struggle regardless of all the other things that he told us about there's always going to be when you split somebody that's supposed to be one walking is one family is one when you split them apart and then this one marries another one and this one there's another one you got a lot of mix of stuff and you can't really come together and fellowship right you can tolerate the tolerate is way far from fellowship right all right we want to have Fellowship one with another all right let's go what were you saying okay the move is on what number hello 473 foreign I don't know foreign foreign okay now that money this thing ain't got good they got good shooting okay oh yeah like hang on a second we got a brother that worked with them that fell off the roof how can more this man stand in his place than a man that fell off a roof and survived and have faith for this brother that's got complications but he wants the whole church to pray he said he thought about Danny as he was falling so let's take that connection that connection that that man thought of let's take it right here and let's take this cloth and send it right to that brother he wanted all the church to pray so let's all bow our heads your heavenly father you told us one time morning Mark 16 you give us a promise you said if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover you said if we ask anything in your name Lord that you'd give it to us so father is this prayer cloth goes to this young man and it's laid on his body is the holy spirit Lord the cleansing power of your blood Lord it was shed at Calvary for everything that we did Lord's past and presence for all sickness and sorrow and pain and death Lord you should sacrifice that on the cross and Lord now we got to look to you and have faith and even if this young EST young Have Faith Lord he's made a connection with someone that does have faith he just haven't made a connection with the army of the almighty God that will pray now that you'll when this cloth is laid on this gentleman Lord that you'll do a miracle in his life and Lord as your heal his body Lord faster than than ever before that Lord just save his soul that you bring Lord him bring him to a remembrance Lord than a group of people was asked to pray and their prayers were answered father we pray now that you had just touch him more be with him his brother Danny takes it to him or may he get a blessing from him may he touch his body and strengthen him Lord we ask these things in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen I believe it may God go ES foreign we're doing a lot better tomorrow right he's blessed Beyond always look and see that God's blessed you all right well I promise you one thing when you get up in the morning get out of bed and say thank you God that's a victory in this end time that's a victory and I'll promise you one thing the devil don't like it but I don't care it doesn't bother me anymore the devil can play all his little tricks he wants to play yeah we have a plan we have a way to go Jesus said I'm the way I'm the truth and I'm the life so let's look to him take what I said today and if you don't have children maybe you'll be able to teach somebody else this but I want you to I want you to look at this folks and look that to take these steps even when you're even when you're you're looking at anything in life plan look right and pray then you'll fall in love I promise you then you'll fall in love Love's going to come in there somewhere when two come together and they're really in harmony Love's going to come in there somewhere and it's not gonna be the love of a man it's going to be the world will be all mine and when to live with the almighty comes in that's Eternal brother that's that Eternal part that's the part that we really don't I don't think we understand a lot of it do you I mean we talk about it and we get a little glimpses of it but we really don't understand like that little button that he gave us said let there be one day and a world came into existence that's right a whole universe was flung off of the faith of one man and now we got faith in that man because we were in that man during that time right you got the new Birds if you're born again you were there I mean you were there the eternal life you have was there with him and said let there be part of the creator that's why brother around said we got enough in us that little button can go create a world and live on it but we're holding here because we don't need to do that right now we don't need that we need to live our life here we need to do things we ought to do here we need to have family and we need to raise our family and raise our kids to be in John or Charles Wesley or to be another William Brown or be another Samuel Dale you know be another generation of of good godly people that you can look at we got there's always got to be an example always got to be an example good Lord let's go downstairs and and uh have a little refreshment and some cake and ice cream and uh honor our pastor on these 72nd birthday which for for about 50 something years it was today then he realized he was born at one o'clock on the 16th granny told him he's born on the 15th well she probably figured it was the 15th she got she started having him in the 15th but she didn't have until the 16th so it took two days for that stubborn guy to get out but on the 16th is his birthday so that's tomorrow so we're going to honor him today though by having cake and ice cream and I know there's a few of you got gifts in there for him best gift you can give him is is to listen to what he says and live it let him see that reflected back in you that's that's the best thing you can
