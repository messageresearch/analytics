========================================

[Music] open ears I want to see them yes I want to see to see you pour out your powering on see [Music] shiny in the light of your glory a man you loving all right to power and Oh [Music] [Music] amen I want to see a man that ain't there amen that's a desire should be if ever person's heart is to see God what we desire he meant good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn world we've been reading in Ephesians 2 and then we'll go to Roman's 3 visions to Roman's 3 remember there's many sick among us and all in sister Anna over the alcohol and said she was six and I don't know you've prayed for these remember brother dick or the island just preach the Lord would be with each one there's a lot that I told them there the other night everybody's falling down I reckon we're getting older brother Colley failed and hurt his side and sister Johnny failed sister Regina fell so everybody just to falling down so we're gonna have to do something we're gonna have to maybe get some walking sticks and start passing them out or or some kind of something to help everybody cuz we're all getting so old but just remember that white names up he took him and zoom took brother sister read up to brother Tim Hughes tonight and they wanted him to stay over so they're staying over there and being the service they can view us later but remember the helmet they will be traveling back home okay Ephesians 2 Romans 3 anything that we missed we gently miss nothing little reckon okay father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord and to us thank you for the our thank you for loving us and caring for us thank you for Lord being you and we just ask you to God each one of us and help us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you and Lord that's your grace and love be sufficient blessed us tonight as we try to minister your word to your people and just open our hearts remember the ones that are sick among us and you said it you promised to send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction and we thank you have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your love in Jesus name Amen they're not visitors they've been here before so we're glad to have the girls with us tonight amen seasons 2 we've been reading this for a while and probably keep on reading it for a while but maybe you'll learn what it means one of these days to for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of God amen was so grace is a gift ok go to Romans 3 will read fronted verse 3:23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past the notice remission of sins that are past there's no such thing as praying for sins in the future that's Catholicism that's the wrong doctrine right then why would we even think about it but sins that are past through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time he is righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that which has which believeth in Jesus you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been over over and over in the services trying to get to a point in talking about salvation ok I'm a firm believer in salvation thank God for salvation thanking for his truth to reveal unto us but we had our concepts our thoughts of salvation when we were in organized religions and out in the war role in this worldly system of the church we had our thoughts and ideas of salvation and all of that and I believe God winked at our ignorance and you know led some to him but yet we look out there and see the whole religious world on tonight there's millions rejoicing services all around the world different things praising God but is he's our with them no that's a simple question to ask is he with them you know if he is then we need to find them to be able to go with them that's the best way I can put it you might not like my terminologies but you tell me some other better way of saying it if somebody else has more truth than we have we need to get to the truth that's the best that I've always taught and all that I believe alright let's see we know that Jonah 2 announces salvation is of the Lord all right we've been through over and over talking about salvation and to be an example of the natural birth as to be water blood and spirit to bring us to a natural example to understand the natural birth there and that would be able to understand a spiritual birth which would be water blood spirit or as we pick it up into the terminologies coming up into where we're at we're talking about justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit all right now in doing that then we know that the Prophet taught it and he said he had always taught three stages he'd always taught it that away well I don't understand the people of the message saying now you know well it's just there's a when if we're gonna believe the Prophet and he says something and he gives us a direction all goddess into understanding the Word of God and bringing us to a place to be able to see God's Word unveiled before us then we should believe what he says and not what we think or what anybody else has taught because that way we're not depending upon God of the basis that he sent a prophet we're just playing along in the ranks of the message instead of believing it I believe that when we read the Prophet says this is where it is that's where I'll be you know I mean that's that's the whole thing's always been my way and my thoughts because that's what keeps it in that way and he said on the the future home paragraph 70 80 cities talk three processes are three stages of grace from the beginning well no matter what we think of how that it looks like this or it looks like that you know we have no right to think that we can change any of those things are that he was wrong in what he was saying we should settle down to the basis of saying what the Prophet said is the Word of God all right he said I believe that within why do we believe so much other stuff you know that goes around there's no need of doing it all right let's see three stages justification of sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said he'd always taught it that way paragraph 86 of the future home always taught three processes well then we should be able to put our Christian journey into what the prophet has said and that's what I've been trying to bring to get us to see and ask the question do we have the biblical answer to what is the new birth do we have the Christian answer I mean through the prophets message and the Bible as to what is the new birth well I shouted I cried I spoke in tongues none of that is the new birth that's the aftereffect of the birth all right the baby getting here is the birth then the crying that things like that that is what happens after the baby gets here okay so I was a problem we got what the Prophet says all right in Ephesians 1 in 7 it talks about the forgiveness of sins Colossians 1 in 14 talks about the forgiveness of sin now we were to be the most elated people to think about that God has provided a way to bring us salvation alright but now he hasn't provided 20 different ways there's one way to salvation and that's through Jesus Christ faith in the blood that was shed for us to pay the price and in doing that only in our faith in the blood can our sins be remitted now remember what we've been through okay over it and over it what did the Prophet say he said you say you've accepted Jesus Christ he said but has he accepted you well I know he's accepted me cuz I'm all right that's between you and God but at that's appointed I've kept asking you because there's one thing for certain if what we believe about the new birth will not line up to the Bible and I'm talking about the Bible being the prophets message in the way he brought it and the understanding of the scriptures and and what were to bring if it doesn't line up with that we don't have the Newburgh well why wouldn't anybody want to be concerned enough about their own soul and how many times I've made this statement I'd rather go through life seeking God come down the end of the road and find out I had him all the time then to not seek him at all and find out at the end of the road I didn't have him well you can't tell me I've got him I've got him he's living in my heart and you know that's so does the Baptist the Methodist Presbyterian the brand of Mike's the Lula eyes all of them they've got some way of stating something about the new birth but now you don't hear people talk about justification sanctification the baptism with the Holy Ghost then your prophet said that is the new birth all right that was the first message that the Lord Jesus had when he said you must be born again all right and see them we think we've got it already figured out and when we think we've got it figured out just remember if it's right glory hallelujah but you know what you remember when you used to shout about the Trinity and thought it was true come on you were selling over back there thinking it was true all right but now what I want to approach it is what we read from Romans we're in 25 where it says for the remission of sins that are past there's no such thing as praying for future sins that would be I think the word is what novena is that it and the Catholic but anyhow it means you pray and you'd go down and tell the priest and give him money and and he remix your sins before you ever even sin alright now we don't believe in that we don't accept it in that way because there's nothing there to bring us to salvation alright so then we don't believe in the fact of it being something that we can pray before it ever happens no no that would that's impossible alright so they're our main point tonight is what forgiveness of sins that are past and then we're gonna read what the Prophet says it's a second so follow that thought and it's for sins that are past then we not should not even be concerned about trying to worry about the future you know we need to stay with the truth okay now listen to what your prophet says then we'll get back to earth all of what we're trying to bring so all right let's go to number three we've quoted number two and number three paragraph 78 brother Branham said he count but he comes to us through three stages I taught that at the beginning I've never changed since it's the Word of God alright now how many of us thought about the Word of God in relation to justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost when we were Baptist Methodist Presbyterian etc that didn't even teach those things we just teach them repentance it was all it was was come to the altar accept Jesus Christ as your Savior your your born-again Christian well now if that's true amen but now when your prophet makes a statement about something we should listen to that statement that he makes to see if we have the correct understanding of what he's saying okay go to number three on their names unless this reader ask you to read the future home and I just wondered have you read it but that's alright you read it over here anyway now the first step is repentance towards God then followers after that is water baptism water baptism repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism followers showing that repentance was genuine are to remit our PI sins that has nothing to do with future sins now we remember we were going through it there's one thing for sure we don't believe in water baptism when to regeneration so he's not saying that water baptism remits our sins it's repentance repent and be baptized it's not you getting something without the repentance that repentance has got to be the first day so he says the first step is repentance toward God okay then we follow in the water baptism to show that our repentance it's genuine okay now there's we going through cause we're talking about in stage one of our Christian journey yeah brother Dale I just got it all at one time I've been over this and over this and over it you get tired of me going over and over but did you listen come on but look the mere hour PI sins that has nothing to do with the future what it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for what remission taking away of pi' sins has nothing to do with the future taking away of your PI sin but it has nothing to do with the future okay now listen it's just your sins has been chopped off what you did you can't repent for what Adam done II never done no you just get forgiveness for what you've done the old night is still dire no are you going to read what he says and believe what he says I believe your own thoughts and ideas about it he says it the old nature is still dire you've repented of your sins but he says the old nature is still dire well I've got some things in here where brother Branham says that if we think we believe that way if you read the future home he said and you are having immoral thoughts and things or your your thoughts is wrong and all I got and he says and they come back to you it's a good sign that didn't do any good you understand what I'm saying if something comes back in our lives that didn't stay away all right justification is the first stage of a Christian journey okay it's chopping off of your pie sins it's getting forgiveness of your sins it has nothing to do with your future and it does nothing to your nature come on well brother dad I went to the altar and I cried and I prayed and I had this great feeling I believe it now all these things happen I believe in that but you can do ever better that and still be lost what about going through all of the things of Judas Iscariot that went through justification and sanctification was lost what about you can go through justification and sanctification and be anointed on your spirit and have all of signs and wonders and life leavings and doing and preaching cast out devils and heal the sick and all of that and still be your prophet said lost now is that the way he taught it well I don't see how you could do all of that and be lost you talked to the Prophet talked to God about it Judas Iscariot done it run around said he did what you see we wanted art we won't shut them with self soaped idea of Christianity that doesn't bother our little petty feelings but see that will never work but what a wonderful thing to think about what a wonderful opportunity of a human moral to be able to call out on to God and God will hear his priors and forgive his sins but you see just because your sins are forgiven doesn't mean you're saved I'm saved cause my Sanders forgive having sinned any sense you see since your sins were forgiven and if you tell me you didn't I'm gonna tell you you're a liar and the Bible says you are for the sins plural I'm gonna just tell you upfront see there's no problem go to mine as well you're gonna either to leave or stay or whatever you're gonna do cuz you're gonna make up your own mind but I'm gonna tell you the truth your prophet said it had nothing to do with an with your nature to repent of your sins it just chopped off those sins would you know what I love about it how wonderfully it you realize see we spend half of our life praying about the sins we done know I'm a Mariah it's the biggest portion of your life in repentance been based upon something that was way back you under but just remember if God forgives you your sins he cannot bring those sins again against you because they're put in the seal forgetfulness what a wonderful Savior that would do that that would put our sins so far away until he can't remember it well if my sins is remitted and I'm saved okay you're saved but you know what brother brother Ryan said Judas was saved because Judas Essenes was remitted Judas become to sanctification we'll get to a word the unclean spirit goes out of nothing what you see we did we we've never heard it talked to us we've come down through things and nice like I said most of our most our Methodists Baptists or whatever we've never heard it talk of that you needed to come through just vacation sanctification - baptism with old ago well no your prophet did he's the one that said you're not saved but listen to what he's saying first step is repentance toward God then follows that is water baptism repent be baptized the name is Jesus Christ water baptism followers showing that repentance was genuine you remember how brought that out and dwelled on it so much what if you refuse to get baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what if you refuse to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus right then God is not obligated to remit your sins is that right he's not obligated unless we follow his word but if we follow his word that he becomes obligated what's right and that has nothing to do you repentance is chopping that sin though that you've committed has nothing to do with the future well brother I've always just thought that I just went to the altar and said God save my soul and he saved my soul he give me the new birth he gave me everything I needed right there show me that in the Bible and the prophets message of just what time with you it took the disciples you don't like everyone but it it took on three and a half years to get to a situation enough that the Holy Ghost could come on yet they cast out Devils they heal the sick they done all kind of wonders and miracles and the Bible said they come back and said even the Devils are subject unto us what are you trying to tell me I'm lost no I'm trying to tell you what salvation really is salvation starts by a repentant heart the goodness of God the Bible says leads you to repentance we went through two services enough were that the basis of showing of the repentance part of it and that how God was calling you and the Bible says if God don't call you then you can't come you can't come this cause you won't - God has to call you that has nothing to do remits our high sins pull that back up brothers where I can read it at least number three join us your repentance with genuine are to remain our past sins that has nothing to do with future sin there's a direct statement huh it only remits repent and be baptized and I'm Jesus Christ what for remission taken away of pi' sins has nothing to do with the future I didn't say that he did yeah but you're not reading it right well oh come on anybody won't come up here read it I mean that's why I put them up here unless you read it because that out on the internet they can't argue at least it's up there I'm saying what he said code look what he gets down he chops off what to do you can't repent for what Adam done and all called you never done it Adam did you just got get forgiveness for what you've done the old nature is still there now you've repented of your sins you've asked God to forgive you of your sins but the old nature is still there so justification is not the new birth he said look now we went through that so don't come to me with anything Martin Luther nim had the new bird for their age of their time it was the age of justification there was the age of sanctification it's the age of the baptism when Oulu now is the age of the fully revealed word right but look look what he says then okay let's continue to read Oh so remember now we're looking for something to be able to say justification took this away but we're also looking for what it left no when I got saved I got say I learned you can't tell me I would have saved no you're telling your own self at you insight because you're not locking the way that I say what am I saying what the Prophet says it well that wasn't what he meant now you get over on that style and and this look now let's just do something with what he done tonight let's do a little bit with it so we go into paragraphs 89 of the future home he said let me take a board just a minute brother branham draws illustration on the blackboard now here's a human heart now I'm not I'm not a long ways from being an artist here's a human heart and here's a human heart now anybody knows that he draw the human heart and he draw the human heart right okay now watch him he drawled her human heart t2 human heart here's a human heart here's a human heart this one over here has a snake in it that's in who saw that mr. second retorted here he has his life he's describing one of those hearts and he's describing that in that heart is sin he's describing that in that heart is the snake the snake is the unclean spirit right we'll read that one second so don't worry about it but I didn't know no snake in me what did you have he's born in sins having an iniquity spouting mother's womb went for the liar what was in you yeah but I come with this seed in me see all that went in there to deteriorate away from the teaching of the new birth there was a purpose for that all that being brought out was to stop the new birth from being talked I don't have to go through Jessica st. fix batch control I believe the prophets message if you believe the prophets message that's what we're reading so now you just made your own self a liar look you're tough look tough what are you come on this one here has a snake in it that's in here he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has life will this one here he has malice hatred Envy that's what's causing it is that fella here what's causing the hatred the envies the problem that fella what fellow the snake then clean spirit okay well shortness a second come on well this one over here had love and joy and long-suffering that's what does it down here now watch it now when you asked now listen do your repentance when you ask are you are forgiven of your sins the whole don't you only done this now what you do taken that away taking what away what's the other picture is it just a second line but the thing that made you do it is still there you mean when you ask God to forgive you of your sins and he chopped your sins totally off if he didn't come right down and fill you with the Holy Ghost you still have the devil inside of you call the snake I don't know that's what I'm saying you turn down the very word that can save you but the thing that made you do it is spilled our that's the old root of evil it's still there notice in your baptized never forgive you what you for your sins now let's pull up that drawing we made a drawing now it's not brother branham's drawing we made a drawing to represent uh-huh so what is mankind when he's born in sin seven iniquity he's went forth the liar he's a sinner what is he who's this guy the old root of evil the unclean spirit Jesus spoke up goes out of a man father wall because that's sanctification see that's the next message alright look sin What did he say over here he said here is a man he said he's got a unclean spirit the root of evil is still in him and said he's got sin huh what does justification do to that person it only remits his sins now come on we just read the Prophet said their old root of evil don't go out it's still there what caused you to do it it's still there all right now your sin so remember he's saying these little things you go back and you read it the little things you see what do you draw this is seeing little lines okay pull it to the next stage what do we see when you repent of your sins what has happened this guy's still dark that's what your prophet just said now come on read it you got the quotes in front of you faith tries to replace the basis of our sin because that's where sin has gone out by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ so that sin that we had is taken out by the blood of Jesus Christ by faith in God's Word it brings us to a place called justification which really all justification does he's chops off your pie sins it does nothing to your nature we just read it future home that unclean spirit is still left that old root of evil I'll save you a little trouble when you start to don't try to look up root of evil in the Bible you won't you won't find it exactly the way but around me uses the wording I like the way he uses wording the unclean spirit is in the Bible but the root of evil is a little different so I'm just telling you try to save you a little trouble and to help you but I don't you know but look see you've asked God to forgive your sins and your sins are remitted by faith in the blood but what caused you to do it is still there see that unclean spirit stays in there just because you're repented of your sins because God forgive your sins and doesn't make it straight come on your back back up let's back up and do it come on go back over brothers so that people won't say well brother Dale you done this then back up to number three and let's reread you got your quotes laying in front of you let's reread it all right and see if what I was saying about this part over here that the sin goes out but the unclean spirit the thing that calls you to sin is still in you even though your sins are remitted because it doesn't remit future sins you got to get forgiveness every day of your sins even after you're born again Paul taught a daily sanctification a daily cleansing after you're born again come on first step repentance towards God and father's after that water baptism why do I have to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism father's showing that repentance was genuine are to remit our PI sins has nothing to do with the future sin it all they're in remits repent and be baptized the name of Jesus by offering this is taken away if PI sins has nothing to do with the future does that enough just your sins has been chopped off what you did you don't have to repent for this Adam enough the old nature is still dire come on go to 89 to the next one I'm gonna 88 go to 89 let's take a board just for a moment brother run the drawers of the board here is a human heart no no no no you know here's a human heart and here's a human heart number one heart has a snake in it no is that in the drawing that we the snake is still there even though you've repented that's what he just said here's a human heart this one over here has a snake in it that's sin now it's not just to say the snake is sin to me when he says that sins that's in little whittlin things that we took out over there before that was called sin that's sin does nothing to the nature of the person just look back at your drawing and you'll see it changed from sin to faith right here he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is a Holy Spirit here he has a life that's a human being a life is a human being right and one of these human beings that are sneaking him the other human being had a dove in him then we got to get rid of the snake you can't have the Dove and the snake in the same place I know you don't like it but that's why I never did like the two so people cuz they said God gives you a soul say can give you so Bart brother Ron said Satan cannot create he can't give you a show so that's automatically out come on well this one here has malice now which one then two adds malice the one with the snake has malice Envy in the end what that's what's causing it is this fella here what's called the fella the snake what's causing to go wrong the snake ain't got no snake in me I'm talking about the devil as the snake the Prophet is talking about the devil as a snake not you've got a snake inside of your soul come on well this one over here has love joy that's easy to tell which ones which and look and that's what does it down here what does it what makes this one how love and joy the death what makes this one have malice and hatred and the snake okay come on then when you're asked it works when you repent of your sins now when your ass are your forgiven of your sins you only done this now watching taking that away what did it take away sin seems only thing that went out of justification come on that's what your prophet is saying taken that away what sin whatever you ought to make you draw it and do this out of the other way you do what you want to but just remember read what he says don't do like we've done one time in him ministers meeting and there was two authentic papers that brother Branham had put out and this brother come up and wrote this other one born he made this and everybody I said any nothing more a prophet had to say that's what he had to say he didn't care what the prophets say come on you're forgiven of your sins you only done this taking that away once you take away sin sin flick it back over to where we watch where we can get it and what does it wind up in and now the click of the heart number yeah there dia see we took our sin and tried to put something else in place what because your sin goes out through the faith that is in the blood of Jesus Christ you agree to that not your risk not sure what you do or how you do that it's the repentance for the sin justification alright jump back to where we were now back home number four again and when you asked you are forgiven of your sins you only done this taking that away but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there so after you are repented of your sins if you don't immediately go straight through into the baptism with the Holy Ghost and brother Branham said very few people will that's his words that's not sorry if we don't get something there we ain't drove that thing out yet it's still in that you repent of your sins you what it alter you cried you prayed you said I Love You Lord oh that's wonderful forgive me my sins all that's great but that didn't take that unclean spirit out I didn't say that I just don't like your attitude anyway I don't like yours either so what does that do does that solve any problems then when you ask you're only forgiving your sins you're only done this taking that away but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there so now remember the disciples believed on the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior I'm quoting brother Branham part of us in the future home almost verbatim word the disciples repented of their sins but it took sanctification to drive out the unclean spirit right he took st. John 17:17 I think's right to do what now come back with a heart okay after you repented of your sins the whole thing that made you do it it still though you don't like it I can tell on the faces I can read places I don't have to read I don't how to our discernment I can read faces when your face goes from somewhere in there there's some different okay that's her business the Prophet says what made you do it is still there okay then what we're gonna do with that guy how are we gonna get him out the one of these days you're gonna understand why brother Dale emphatically keep stating ever service almost the new birth is the birth of the word only the birth of the word is gonna drive the devil out of you did you listen only the birth of the word can drive the devil out no we lay hands on the cast them out show me in the Bible where the disciples had to have hands laid on them and catch the devil out of them to get the new birth they didn't have to lay hands on the 3000 outside and get them to go through those stages cast the devil out of him they didn't have to do it at the house the canoes it was the word that drove the devil out it's the word right now that'll drive the devil out of me and you and only the word that unclean spirits gonna stay there until we realize what number one that it's dark right good if you don't believe it's dark you ain't gonna ask God to forgive you okay go ahead to the next one that we got wanted to that number pull up the next one it takes a snake out sanctification is the unclean spirit just drove out of the man that's sanctification you said I don't know okay read number seven go to number seven keep it in mind now we got him clean how does he get clean a notice sanctification the third stage second stage of it cleanses the mind sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of holiness the cleansing about by the word washed by the water of the word come on and a man can repent of sins he's still thinking of now listen to what he's describing maybe he's an immoral man now this is justification come on a man can repent of his sins justification the moral woman looking warmer he fights is still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells a drink it's still dire justification don't take the snake out it don't take out what's causing you to do those things wrong it only chops off the sins of that person that has you've committed the pi's listen but when he gets sanctified cleanse and set aside for service right that cleanses that desire out of him the desire for the woman to desire for the drinking it's going out what by you oughta know and realize what I'm fixing to say is God's honest truth and following you face and cry out for things you realize that when God remitted your sins he was standing right there to cleanse us of all things and take away all of those things he was there to do it right then but we didn't have anybody to help us really or to know what to do ourselves but you know yourself now listen can I quote some of your experiences some of you've told your experiences to me I'm of even wrote them out so he does what that in your life you realized that you come to a knowledge within you of how wrong it was and you ask God to forgive you and a great spirit of relief come upon you that unclean spirit is going out but just remember now if you don't keep him out he's coming back and the Bible says his state in the second is seven times I believe seven I worse than the first you realize where we're at for cleanses that desires out of him it takes a want of it away and watch him I love the Prophet he knows what the human element is it takes the way the one of it just because you get the one of it going don't think you can go back and just take that well we don't bother me to go into a beer joint and and and sit around and talk to them about the Lord while they drank their beer you pour human you're as bad as the guy was at work he didn't drink he didn't do things but ever not them guys and go to the liquor store I'm not joking you know he come back with a bottle they had a bottle this was a coke Thurs was liquor asked him one day I said if I'm standing out in front of the place and I'm looking and you and your buddy comes out you got a brown sack and he's got a brown sack how am I gonna know who's drinking beer or liquor or whatever I said you've got it in your heart you want to drink but you also know your wife will kick you out the door if you do that was his honest as I could say to the man because that was exactly what was happening he wanted to drink but he had enough control I said why don't you just go in and come walking back out when no beer can no brown paper bag then he knew I was hitting him right see it takes a wall of it away he can still be tempted but he takes the wall of it away still even though he takes a wound of it away now what's he saying still he's not right yet cuz he ain't got the vessel fool then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire why does it say it like that Holy Ghost and fire firing the Holy Ghost you'll get to that one these years then the baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire cleanse burn out cleaned up and then put into the service of sanctification only sets them aside for service what about it church what's the sanctification gets rid of that unclean spirit what your prophet says go back and read over and over do you get what he's saying it takes out the won't of those things but yet it doesn't fill you up now how many of you can remember when you got saved you went to the altar then you got up from there and you and listen search I'm trying to be honest the best I can but you've got up crying and praying and thanking God for saving you and you went home and for awhile you've done okay but after a while you started easing back again smoking or drinking or something see what you've done is what has happened the Bible says the unclean spirit will come back - now listen let's see if I can get it he comes back to his house you know that you know the Bible says that I didn't give these that's okay Matthew 12:40 for their 43 well the unclean spirit is going out of a man he walketh in Dry places seeking rest and find us not then he says I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he comes he finds an empty and guard swept and garnished luke says and when the unclean spirit is going out of him in walking drop away - nothing returning to my house which I came out my house this used to be the house of the devil our very body being the vowel body soul and spirit was lost we belong to Satan remember in the Book of Ruth when they come down through the earth that they was one closer canden than boys that's the devil brother Branham said was closer kin to you and me hope it don't don't strip hurt my kids my kids don't need to learn these things why do they need to learn setting up a sex education let him learn send him to school and let him learn and I ain't against to go into school but you know what I just said is right they teach them in school what they want them to know so go ahead do you want to know the plan of salvation or do you want to know your don't you are you satisfied with your own ideas and thoughts the unclean spirit goes out of a man when it do I sprang that one up before it's pure and clean put one more in that one rang up the soul which he'll back up one there you go root of evil goes out Matthew Coyle the soldier scripture the unclean spirit sanctification executive is not truth thy Word is truth and that's what you got but that's the most dangerous stage to any Christian that has ever been because if you don't get that fool fast quick Satan's coming back there's only one way to drive him out see I never knew these things when I was a quick I mean become finally a Christian 18 years of age when I joined the Baptist Church I didn't know anything about wash by the water of the word know things but I had a desire in my heart to know God's Word I had a desire to know his word to study it to read it and try to understand it I started reading the word you know how to keep a devil out read God's Word and quote that word back to the devil you want him to be grow out and keep him out just keep quoting the word back to them then you know what I say say I know and I'm quoting brother Branham no human mortal can withstand the devil right you need that quote that's a par phrase it's close very close no human being is a match for the devil oh but brother Branham was if that demon hadn't got a hold of me when I was 12 years old I would have been converted that's a direct quote your prophet just said oh you mean brother Branham had a demon in that yeah so do you at a snake just like the rest of us but by being a prophet he knew how to handle God's word Satan comes to you and starts telling you how dirty your best thing do disagree with him because if you with him they're gonna do no good he's the author of a fuss you know what I mean he loves it that way don't argue with it just say Satan you're right but said Jesus Christ saved my soul and he says here in the word if I believe and accept him he'll take care of everything that I do or have done he'll cover it all and he'll cleanse me see that unclean spirit it's got to be taken out because that's the old root of evil that's the snake that according to the Book of Ruth that was more tend to us than Jesus Christ right because we're born kinfolks to the devil I just don't understand you you just make things just too plain to blow in this world's over with I'll have my reward because I can stand before every one of you at judgment and declare I tried to tell you the truth I tried filer yeah failure always a failure yeah brother Dale do you do you live a good life no no it takes Christ to be a Christian I don't see my brother instead takes God to be a crazy God to be or they say and Christ be a Christian it's one way or the other you see that's why that unclean spirit has got to be driven out but you've got to get something in the place of it now those disciples for three and a half years had that demon drove out of them one day God came to live we'll get back into it you read the future home study it listen to it see this world has come through justification right and land the future home the days of Noah it was washed by the water in the days of the Lord Jesus the blood dropped back upon the earth to cleanse and claim it one of these days is gonna get a fire baptism let's see what I love about it we've already stepped ahead because we can already go through justification sanctification the baptism with the Holy Ghost and stand here and say we are the redeemed it's not what you and I can do is not it it's what he's already done brother Dale do you ever do wrong you ever have a wrong thought I stand right here preaching and then things bounce off I'm human what I do thank you lord thank you let me know where I stand you know you have wrong thoughts can I quote the Prophet brother Branham do you sin he said every day the Bible says for the sins of the people brother Ron said sinners don't have sins they have sinned sinners don't house-sit sins they have sinned Christian how sins the devil comes that he brings sin and God remits our sins what about a wonderful Savior can tell us all of that and tell us how easy it is and all we got to do is just accept him as I say it one more time let's don't be just too foolish about it because we think we got it made you better be careful I'll guarantee you one thing when you think you got one devil defeated you better look around behind it because there's another one real close and he's gonna do everything he can to take it place me that's what it takes the born-again experience to feel the vessel the baptism with the Holy Ghost feels the vessel the new bird feels the vessel that Satan can't come back come on musician think on these things what is the first stage of Christianity justification chopping off our Pisceans asking God to cleanse us and goddess repentance and guidance and Happiness Lord be with us and take care of us Lord forgive me help me I'm having a lot of problems you see when he comes in saving can't stay there so if you want the unclean spirit out ask God in if you don't have God in the unclean spirit is still there remember it can only be driven out by the power of the revealed word it ain't you quitting come on you know what I'm talking about you quit this you quit that next day you got two more to quit again you get through that one get it straightened out the Lord I'm doing pretty good and about that time here comes another one I've told you about it we were hunting years ago and and we had camped way down below we're waiting of the group was up here we were on the same piece of property but you know we didn't have any electrical hook-up so we moved it up wait told me said daddy said you'd only move up here he said you don't want to do I said I thought we was Christian I didn't know we would be all that so we move up there set up our campers and get lights and have everything you know we were sitting around there one day talking and one of them said Sam I I hate to do this to drink in front of you I said don't bother me at all I said you know the only thing I won't say to you recently ain't getting me a dr. pepper because my mouth is watering you know I need something to drink I don't need your liquor then stuccoed I never did drank this stuff to start with what I said don't you worry about it you know what those are the nicest guys those guys would do it I've set in hunting clubs with doctors and lawyers and in all kind of high-ranking people and then turnaround system I hate to drink in front of you don't bother me I don't I don't have to have something to drink if I do give me a dr. pepper you know and they just I've always had real good friendship with a lot of good men that hated your drink in my presence say a dirty words I'm sorry I'm sorry then what I know you don't just be what y'all want to be anything different come on listening oh we got 372 my sins are gone
