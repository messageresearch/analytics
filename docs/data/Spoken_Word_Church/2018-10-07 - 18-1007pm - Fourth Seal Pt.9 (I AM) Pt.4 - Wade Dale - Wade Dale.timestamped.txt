[14:00] that's what it is yeah
[14:02] it'd be alright if you physically saw
[14:04] him but there's a lot of people
[14:05] physically sawing him after he
[14:07] resurrected and didn't believe who he
[14:08] was but if you ever have him inside you
[14:11] my brother Martin was talking this
[14:14] morning can you give me some water my
[14:17] water my water boy is not here Bob gone
[14:20] water boy is gone left me left me dry
[14:24] good to be in the house with Lord but
[14:27] yeah like brother Martin said you know
[14:28] it takes but yesterday was mine in
[14:37] June's 39th wedding anniversary so I
[14:40] told him I said told him downstairs I
[14:44] said there's one thing I'm still waiting
[14:47] to hear for 39 years nobody has ever
[14:51] asked me how I put up with her nobody
[14:55] but everybody asked how can she put up
[14:59] with me so but I'm waiting and why have
[15:02] I have hope that beside the point
[15:05] beside the ball beside the boy but yeah
[15:08] we'd 39 years together so all right
[15:12] listen I don't want to train another one
[15:13] that one that one's got me drained so
[15:15] that's good enough for me so let's turn
[15:17] it up close to revelations six and get
[15:22] started I hope you enjoying the fourth
[15:25] seal I thought I told somebody the other
[15:27] day I said I thought this was going to
[15:28] be about four sermons on the fourth
[15:30] ceiling and that was going to be it
[15:32] because we were just going to talk about
[15:33] a rapture
[15:34] no we still this is part 4 on I am the
[15:38] resurrection and we hadn't even got I am
[15:40] the resurrection yet so but you know I
[15:43] like to let get a good background and
[15:45] that way that we can all I know as well
[15:50] as you do that we don't get everything
[15:52] in the sermon yeah you know you get an
[15:55] hour and like I said you may get 15
[15:57] minutes of some good information for you
[15:59] you know and then it might be somebody
[16:02] else's 15 minutes another part because
[16:05] you don't I wish we did I'll get it the
[16:07] same at the same time but we don't so
[16:10] like brother Gary Krantz that told me
[16:12] Sunday he said I seen some things that I
[16:15] had read right and you yeah he so we're
[16:19] going home there's things that we talked
[16:21] about Sunday that it's like we're
[16:23] talking about this morning the Sunday
[16:25] school class it all the body changed
[16:28] everything we needs already in the Bible
[16:30] there's no addition that we have to add
[16:33] something or even jack it up you know we
[16:37] don't have to you know rev it up it's
[16:39] already in there and the words already
[16:41] anointed so it's there for us those who
[16:46] he's justified he's already glorified I
[16:48] mean you really could just stop right
[16:49] there and your if you'd believe that if
[16:53] you believe that then we will go to a
[16:56] glorified body boo but as humans we have
[16:59] different avenues and different waves to
[17:02] get to that we have to we have to by the
[17:07] foolishness of preaching we have to all
[17:09] come to a place to where we understand
[17:11] our little bit and our little part like
[17:13] brother Martin this morning he he he was
[17:19] it was so funny he was talking about you
[17:21] know he thought that the preacher had
[17:23] that his girlfriend had been talking to
[17:25] the preacher about you know their well
[17:27] if you'll notice today there was
[17:29] somebody here that was a hadn't been
[17:31] here in a long time yeah a male that had
[17:37] been here in a long time and the same
[17:40] situation pretty much and there he was
[17:42] preaching on the same thing so man I'm
[17:45] telling you I was going good and yes
[17:46] Lord you're working you're working is if
[17:51] we'll just listen on our end he's always
[17:53] working on his then we just got to
[17:54] listen on our end
[17:55] and and make the theme manifest so let's
[17:58] let's go in Revelations and let's read
[18:00] our our fourth seal because really if we
[18:07] don't get this part I mean we're not
[18:09] going to take a rapture because the
[18:10] rapture happens on the for sale so we
[18:13] got to get this and we got to get it
[18:14] down right and and get it to where we
[18:18] can y'all got the fonts a little bit
[18:21] smaller on there than some of the I
[18:24] can't hardly read that yeah it's a
[18:29] little bit a little bit smaller you
[18:32] might want to try to fix that in a few
[18:34] minutes but revelation 6:1 let's bow our
[18:37] heads before we get started
[18:38] dear lord thank you for another day Lord
[18:41] we were taught thinking this morning
[18:43] what an opportunity it is to just come
[18:45] into a house and sit and listen to your
[18:49] saints talk even though just even being
[18:52] a minister or not a minister but just
[18:54] being able to converse and fellowship
[18:56] and have have fellowship one with
[18:58] another and be able to talk and even
[19:01] though sometimes we may talk about the
[19:02] things of life Lord somewhere in in that
[19:06] and intertwined into that conversation
[19:08] is you about something you've done for
[19:11] us this week or something we saw in the
[19:13] word or or something that's going on in
[19:16] our life that we know that you move
[19:18] supernaturally well that to me Lord
[19:20] that's that's telling me that you're
[19:22] right here you're doing what you said
[19:25] you were going to do Lord and you're
[19:26] doing it in human flesh father we pray
[19:29] that you just be with the ones that are
[19:30] sick Lord be with the ones that are not
[19:32] here be with the ones on the highways
[19:34] traveling by the Bob and ones that are
[19:36] gone off Lord we pray that you'd be with
[19:38] them and keep them safe bring them back
[19:39] Lord together with all of us here bless
[19:43] the missionaries on the foreign fields
[19:45] give them fruit for their labor Lord
[19:46] just touch each one forgive us of our
[19:48] sins Lord because we fail you every day
[19:50] but you told us that we were perfect you
[19:54] said that we would come to this and you
[19:56] made a way for it to happen Lord may we
[19:59] just now enter into the
[20:00] way and be able to get a good revelation
[20:03] from you today father bless us and take
[20:05] care of us
[20:06] the further man this service in Jesus
[20:08] name we pray amen we had opened the
[20:12] fourth seal that's better I've heard the
[20:16] voice of the fourth beast say come and
[20:17] see
[20:18] and I looked and behold a pale horse in
[20:20] him that sat on him was his name that
[20:22] sat on him was death and hell followed
[20:24] with him and power was given unto them
[20:26] over the fourth part of the earth to
[20:27] kill with the sword and with hunger and
[20:29] with death and with the beasts of the
[20:31] earth
[20:32] let's go ahead and read Joel to be glad
[20:35] then the children of Zion and rejoicing
[20:36] the Lord your God for you have given you
[20:38] the former rain moderately and then
[20:42] we've got the wheat listen that full
[20:44] that scripture is fulfilled we have the
[20:48] former rain right now in our possession
[20:52] just what God is talking about not a
[20:55] substitute we have us think about this
[20:58] the other day we don't it is the very
[21:00] rain that God is telling us about not a
[21:04] substitute not something coming we have
[21:06] the former rain hey ma'am

[21:12] moderately and he will cause to come
[21:14] down for you the rain the former rain

[21:20] fat shall overflow with wine and oil and
[21:23] I will restore to you the years that the
[21:26] locust has eaten the cankerworm
[21:27] caterpillar pummel worm my great army
[21:29] was I sent among you and you shall eat
[21:32] him plenty and be satisfied and praise
[21:33] the name of the Lord your God that he
[21:36] has dealt wondrously with you and my
[21:37] people shall never be ashamed you may be
[21:40] seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[21:42] the reading the word let me just make a
[21:44] comment I know we it was a good many of
[21:46] us at Bible study last night when we're
[21:49] talking about hearing the book of Job
[21:51] we're talking about I will restore well
[21:54] there's jr. man when your daddy's not
[21:58] here you supposed to take up his slack
[22:02] thank you brother that was already open
[22:08] Louise
[22:10] did you do it oh thank you I appreciate
[22:13] that I thought it's Louie's dinner I'm
[22:15] not gonna drink this stuff
[22:18] it's kind of hard it's kind of you know
[22:20] it's kind of unsettling when you can
[22:23] just take the top right off you wonder
[22:26] what they did with it anyway my home we
[22:28] redo these so if you get one at my house
[22:30] it will be like this we're a little bit
[22:33] cheap when it comes to that anyway so
[22:35] let's get back to the to the message
[22:39] here but last night what we're talking
[22:41] about them the bugs because that is a
[22:45] bug that's one bug locust pom worm it's
[22:48] just all different sections or
[22:51] development of that bug right but now I
[22:54] want to explain something to you because
[22:56] we say that the word was eaten down and
[22:59] that we say that this thing eats the
[23:01] leaves in the bark eat the SAP and
[23:05] whatever else it was right now listen
[23:08] folks hear me one time you can't eat god
[23:12] damn The Tree of Life has never looked
[23:16] bad okay cuz that's talking about the
[23:20] tree The Tree of Life has never looked
[23:22] bad The Tree of Life has never had to
[23:24] leave eat off of it
[23:25] it's never had to bark eat off of it but
[23:28] what have what are we talking about
[23:30] we're talking about what man has done
[23:33] with what God has given thereby alright
[23:37] with that because you can teach tree
[23:39] life down tree life's eternal and man
[23:42] you can't destroy the tree of life but
[23:44] you can just just destroy the effects
[23:46] that it has on man have you ever heard
[23:50] the phrase now remember this is a bug
[23:53] have you ever heard the phrase put a bug
[23:56] in his ear right I'll put a bug in his
[24:00] ear well that's what happened that's
[24:03] exactly what happened because it hearing
[24:09] faith comes by hearing what happened was
[24:12] these down through the ages these people
[24:15] have put a button I'm coming my
[24:16] preachers have put a bug into people's
[24:20] ear and it has eat away at what the
[24:22] truth is
[24:24] and then they eat away at the truth the
[24:29] truth listen we can't you can't erode
[24:32] the truth the truth of God is the truth
[24:36] it'll never lose its power it'll never
[24:39] lose its strength but when you put man
[24:41] in the mix individuals man preachers in
[24:46] the mix what they tell you becomes a
[24:51] doctrine well what did they do they put
[24:54] a bug in your ear and that bug started
[24:57] eating not at the tree it started eating
[24:59] at you right here this is where it eats
[25:01] happen that's not a physical tree that
[25:04] it needs it eats your thoughts and your
[25:07] ideas you know why I've told y'all
[25:09] plenty of times when y'all start a
[25:11] phrase with me that says I thought I
[25:16] know they didn't I know that it ain't
[25:19] coming from the good place
[25:21] well I thought well now we don't have us
[25:23] all coming but just be careful with that
[25:26] but that's what always got me was was
[25:29] that there was a bug planted in them
[25:30] ended people buy an idea contrary to God
[25:35] and it eat away at the effect it had on
[25:39] that person same way with me and you
[25:41] listen God can't honor a false doctrine
[25:44] he doesn't have to
[25:46] right I mean sure he he let's say he
[25:51] wings it to ignorance for people because
[25:52] the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism and
[25:54] see that was one of the bugs because
[25:57] that didn't come from God so that had to
[26:00] come from the devil but we accepted it
[26:02] by what they just kept preaching it kept
[26:04] preaching it kept preaching it if you
[26:06] preach something long enough to beat
[26:07] somebody I'll take you and go I think I
[26:10] see that and then see they'll go tell
[26:11] somebody else they'll go put that bug in
[26:13] somebody else's there then where does it
[26:16] either way it either wait here it didn't
[26:17] eat away the word it didn't need a way
[26:20] to tree of life or the God and either
[26:23] way what in your thoughts in your minds
[26:25] and your ideas meanwhile I was talking
[26:26] about the other day I've took the quote
[26:27] out we won't read it again we're brother
[26:30] Brown said that Eve that she fell in her
[26:32] in her mind first she didn't fall in
[26:34] them the natural act the natural act
[26:36] happen
[26:37] because of what went into the womb of
[26:38] her mind all right so being in the womb
[26:41] of our mind is where we have our problem
[26:43] I don't know about you but that's my
[26:46] problem the womb of my mind what I
[26:48] conceived in my brain is my problem but
[26:54] if we let God restore he said he would
[26:59] he said I will restore where's he
[27:01] restored he's not restoring the word
[27:03] this has been written the same way it
[27:05] was written since the 1300s I was
[27:08] looking back there because I wanted to
[27:09] see I want to bring something out later
[27:11] on but the word Bible really has nothing
[27:14] to do with religion it has nothing to do
[27:18] religion nothing it's actually a root
[27:22] word that came from
[27:25] I'll read it here now and won't have to
[27:28] read in a minute be ybl OS it was an
[27:30] ancient Phoenician city where Paris was
[27:33] exported in Paris was the first papers
[27:36] that they used to write the book any
[27:39] book and so the Bible only came into
[27:42] existence in the 1300s so you can't so
[27:45] what why are you saying that well when
[27:47] he says in the beginning was the word we
[27:49] think of this come on people we think of
[27:53] this it's not this this was written in
[27:58] the 1300s so it's not very old
[28:01] as far as written in a book that's why
[28:04] Paul couldn't say in the Bible it says
[28:06] no he was writing the Bible he was
[28:10] writing something that was put they were
[28:11] compiling it together but the Bible says
[28:14] in the beginning was the word well in
[28:15] the beginning was this no in the
[28:17] beginning was a man right in the
[28:21] beginning was the man so the word must
[28:23] always be a man right in the beginning
[28:26] was word Word was with God in the Word
[28:28] was God not this we're not going to
[28:33] carry these in eternity I thought we
[28:36] were supposed to become that I thought
[28:38] John eat this in Revelations 10 this
[28:41] thing disappeared John ate it any what
[28:45] it became part of John so anyway so keep
[28:48] that thought in mind while we go through
[28:50] this now
[28:50] go to John 12 let's read a few more of
[28:53] these his background at least Donnie
[28:55] told me he enjoyed me backgrounding so
[28:57] at least for me and Donnie's gonna stand
[28:59] here and talk to each other today okay
[29:00] all right they want to listen they can
[29:02] write okay all right
[29:04] yet they can enter in right okay and
[29:06] Jesus man the hour has come that the Son
[29:10] of man should be glorified now we gonna
[29:14] get in the son of man a little bit today
[29:15] barely barely I'm saying do you accept
[29:17] the corn of wheat fall into the ground
[29:18] and die it abideth alone but if it die
[29:21] it bringeth forth much fruit now we know
[29:24] what had to happen the son of man had to
[29:26] going to the ground God in human flesh
[29:30] had to die resurrect to bring a
[29:33] restoration to a resurrection now all
[29:38] right so the same thing is what happened
[29:42] in the Dark Ages brother I'm told us
[29:44] that the corn of wheat went into the
[29:45] ground and ICEA which was right about
[29:47] here 600 ad in here it took a little
[29:50] while you know there's overlaps but by
[29:53] the end of this was the longest stage it
[29:55] was about 1500 years that bug in the air
[29:59] of 1500 years of teaching
[30:03] well when Luther come out all he can all
[30:05] he had was a just shall live by faith
[30:06] because the world had been covered by
[30:09] the other doctrines and the people had
[30:11] accepted it as truth even Luther
[30:14] accepted it as truth to a degree right
[30:17] he was a Trinitarian he was actually a
[30:20] Catholic right he was he came out of the
[30:24] Catholic George but he brought a lot of
[30:25] things with it but the just shall live
[30:27] by faith was not one that was the Word
[30:31] of God that God started restoring but it
[30:33] was a renoise or Reformation we are a
[30:35] bit through that but that was starting
[30:37] the restoration of like brother Branham
[30:40] preached restoration of the broad tree
[30:43] everybody alright with that
[30:44] so now let's accept the corner wheat so
[30:48] that had to happen there had to be a
[30:51] falling away there had to be a going
[30:53] down for there to be to me this is the
[30:56] way I look at it at quart of wheat went
[30:59] in the ground why why because of false
[31:03] teaching
[31:05] we killed Jesus Christ because of our
[31:08] sin our false ideas you said well it
[31:11] wasn't a false teaching well yeah it was
[31:13] yeah it was nobody believed who he was
[31:16] nobody
[31:18] my brother was preaching this morning
[31:20] started with 12 went to 5,000 he forgot
[31:23] the four thousand that he fed again then
[31:25] there was 400 then there were 70 and
[31:27] then he was seen a five hundred brethren
[31:29] after but when he was hanging on the
[31:31] cross it was one guy nobody believed his
[31:34] doctrine if not they would have been
[31:37] there trying to get him off that cross
[31:38] but they weren't they were scattered
[31:39] same way with you and I but when the
[31:41] Holy Ghost comes in which that's when
[31:44] the Holy Ghost comes and brings us back
[31:46] to life bring forth much fruit and
[31:50] that's what's happening right now
[31:51] I believe the fruit we're showing who we
[31:53] are and we're gonna have to show who we
[31:55] are because of this scripture don't you
[31:58] come back to restoration you're coming
[32:00] back to the fruit you're not coming back
[32:02] to stalks and leaves and bark you're
[32:05] coming to the fruit
[32:06] all right I'll read up to you in just a
[32:08] minute okay we'll read this long quote
[32:10] cuz I really like it well looking John
[32:12] 11 verse 21 we've got to finish reading
[32:16] these and get them get them all lined up
[32:19] then said mark them to Jesus Lord if
[32:20] thou hadst been here my brother had not
[32:21] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[32:24] thou will ask him God God will give it
[32:26] to thee jesus said unto her thy brother
[32:29] shall rise again Martha said in him I
[32:32] know that he shall rise again in the
[32:33] resurrection at the last day jesus said
[32:37] unto her I am the resurrection and the
[32:39] life what do you do he brought it from
[32:40] way back to he brought it right down to
[32:42] where he was that I am the resurrection
[32:44] and the life and he that believeth in me
[32:47] though they were he were dead yet shall
[32:49] he live and whosoever liveth and
[32:52] believeth in me shall never die believe
[32:55] us now this somebody's gonna believe
[32:57] that verse 26 and not take a physical
[33:00] death and then somebody will break that
[33:03] not break that Scripture but will
[33:05] fulfill that scripture because you know
[33:08] what it is right now it's a prophecy
[33:10] it's a prophecy
[33:12] 2,000 years ago a man stood at a grave
[33:14] and said that but it has not happened
[33:17] until it
[33:18] happen now see we've come to a time to
[33:20] where all this now can happen everything
[33:23] is where it's supposed to be German
[33:25] chocolate cake don't fall asleep in five
[33:27] minutes into the service please people
[33:29] good grief pinch yourself drink some
[33:31] coffee
[33:32] no yeah drinking some coffee grief come
[33:38] on everybody okay every by the way it
[33:43] got some smiling faces we go out start
[33:46] praying I'm gonna call the heart attack
[33:49] I'm sorry so we might have to we mount
[33:51] to pray for heart condition here in a
[33:52] minute yeah anyway let's go to the next
[33:55] one so now we remember death has to be
[33:59] destroyed that ought to make you happy a
[34:01] restoration of all things takes place
[34:03] now when I say a resurrection
[34:05] restoration of all things takes place I
[34:07] was telling the son is good class this
[34:08] morning you and I must realize when
[34:10] Jesus came out of that tomb and said I
[34:12] all power and heaven earth been given
[34:14] unto me now if we're heirs and joint
[34:17] heirs with Christ what point in time are
[34:20] you gonna start believing that all power
[34:23] in heaven Earth's been given unto you
[34:25] wait a minute he gave Peter the keys to
[34:29] the kingdom and he wasn't even converted
[34:31] hey man
[34:33] we'll read it in a minute Peter wasn't
[34:35] even converted he said Peter just by
[34:37] what you said I'll give you the keys to
[34:38] the kingdom and whatever you bind on
[34:41] earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you
[34:43] loose on earth I'll loose in heaven and
[34:47] he never took it away he never took it
[34:51] see that's what the faith of the fathers
[34:53] see what happened was jesus knew what
[34:56] Peter was and what he was going to be so
[35:00] while he was here he went ahead and give
[35:02] him the keys now Peter didn't start
[35:04] driving the car until the day of
[35:05] Pentecost right because he was that the
[35:10] he was that the garden gets them and he
[35:12] cut the ears off right that wasn't the
[35:15] keys to the kingdom
[35:16] no but God but but Jesus knew that he
[35:19] would come to a place that he would be
[35:22] the one that would open the door into
[35:25] them into the Gentile world but a
[35:27] resurrection has to take place in the
[35:28] rapture takes place on this seal so now
[35:31] let's go to
[35:31] restoration of the broad tree for
[35:34] messengers of death see brother Brown
[35:36] brings it what we talked about last
[35:37] Sunday he brings him he brings it to
[35:39] messengers for messengers of death
[35:42] killed it so it had to be somebody in
[35:45] human flesh because remember a false
[35:50] doctrine can never come from God so it
[35:53] can't come from the Holy Ghost it has to
[35:56] come from an unholy ghost it has to come
[35:59] from a teaching right it has to come
[36:01] from a teaching somewhere other than God
[36:04] all right so it was for messengers of
[36:06] death killed the tree for messengers of
[36:09] life restored the tree and as we were
[36:12] talking last Sunday how is he going to
[36:14] restore it he's going to restore it how
[36:16] by for death messengers killed it the
[36:19] for life messengers will restore it what
[36:23] was the first Martin Luther
[36:25] justification what was the second John
[36:27] Wesley by sanctification what was the
[36:30] third Pentecost now listen
[36:32] those are names for those of people
[36:34] those are people even Pentecost was
[36:38] people with the restoration of the gift
[36:42] the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:44] what was the fourth the word he saw that
[36:46] was seeing then you go back first thing
[36:48] when you say word you think of this yeah
[36:50] don't think that anymore because I
[36:54] thought the word became flesh I thought
[36:59] the word became flesh what was the
[37:04] fourth the word what the word there were
[37:07] four great prophets one of them Martin
[37:10] Luther he began to shine a lot there was
[37:13] a little light just a very small
[37:14] strength of justification
[37:16] Along Came Wesley stronger
[37:18] sanctification after Wesley came to
[37:21] stronger than him Pentecost Pentecostal
[37:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost in another
[37:27] great prophet say excuse me but in the
[37:31] last day the Mount come for Elijah's to
[37:33] come with what the very word that
[37:37] restoration message is not arrest it's
[37:39] not a Reformation a Reformation you can
[37:42] add your own idea to it
[37:47] Martin Luther was not full restoration
[37:52] there was some things added to it like
[37:54] Father Son Holy Ghost eternal hell all
[37:56] those things that was added by man but
[38:00] God was happy with his box to just shall
[38:02] live by faith never I got that okay
[38:06] Martin Luther the word Lord came to the
[38:10] prophets in the evening light I mean
[38:11] Elijah has to come with the very word I
[38:15] hope we see that this message that was
[38:18] brought to us brother Brown said pure
[38:20] unadulterated pure and unadulterated so
[38:24] whatever is in this tent in these books
[38:25] and tapes it's the eternal Word of God
[38:28] given to me in you to restore to do what
[38:36] to restore and bring back what turn the
[38:40] hearts of the children back to the faith
[38:42] of God fourth line for killers took it
[38:45] for messengers destroyed it for
[38:47] messengers of death took it away in
[38:49] Dogma for matures messengers of
[38:53] righteousness restore her back again and
[38:57] then as we said last Sunday prophesy Son
[39:01] of Man now why is it in Ezekiel Ezekiel
[39:04] is telling us a lot about what's going
[39:06] on in the end time and God has come down
[39:08] and ceased his prophesy Son of Man
[39:12] because son of man is a prophet amen son
[39:17] of man is a prophet the son of man when
[39:18] he walked on the earth he was the
[39:20] prophet but what was he doing
[39:22] he was resurrecting the bones descended
[39:28] the skin
[39:29] he was resurrecting through the Son of
[39:33] Man because we'll get to in just a
[39:34] minute all right
[39:36] all right so let's go to now let's give
[39:39] them well now go to paragraph 513 let's
[39:42] read that what the fourth was the word
[39:47] itself the word made flesh fruits of the
[39:51] proof of the resurrection sign that
[39:53] Christ says finally after justification
[39:56] has been planted you see why brother man
[39:59] had
[39:59] come back preach since they wouldn't
[40:00] nobody know what justification was
[40:01] nobody would know what it was when he
[40:04] said justification did go will you come
[40:07] up but he preached justification sure
[40:11] Martin Luther and John Wesley preached
[40:13] justification sanctification but I do
[40:15] not think that Martin Luther come out
[40:18] ever service and said I'm just supposed
[40:21] to preach on justification so I'm just
[40:23] gonna preach on justification no it was
[40:25] intertwined in this message but that's
[40:28] what the people god that's the pure
[40:30] unadulterated word that the people got
[40:33] and got born again under that that all
[40:36] right but you and I have come through
[40:39] the full circle in man every time we
[40:42] come to church the Holy Ghost should
[40:44] fall every time I own all the word that
[40:46] we have not just a little piece of it
[40:48] but all of it
[40:49] after justification has been planted
[40:51] sanctification has been sanctification
[40:54] been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:57] organizations died out and Christ has
[41:00] again centered himself like that like
[41:03] that cap of the pyramid his point of
[41:06] that first line justification
[41:08] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[41:10] then then coming of the cap what is it
[41:14] that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out
[41:16] now that wasn't happening when he was
[41:19] preaching in nineteen what is that from
[41:23] 1962 this is now because you and I are
[41:29] the bunch that can be honed that bunch
[41:32] that he was preaching to not saying that
[41:34] bunch and degrading them but that bunch
[41:36] was not hone like you in our home
[41:39] because they were they were still under
[41:42] the Reformation part being restored but
[41:45] you and I have come to the full part
[41:47] because the sales weren't even open
[41:49] before by them it's only the 422 of 1962
[41:54] so what is he saying
[41:55] the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so
[41:58] that it can fit with the same kind of
[42:00] ministry he had when he went away that
[42:03] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[42:05] thing in the rapture where the justified
[42:07] sanctified in the baptism of the Holy
[42:09] Ghost
[42:10] that pyramid will stand again the house
[42:11] of God will live again
[42:13] the tree of life is growing again
[42:15] alright is that okay but he showed the
[42:18] whole thing right into that coming of
[42:21] the capstone and I will restore sayeth
[42:25] the Lord all the years it just makes me
[42:31] feel good that this is it this is the
[42:33] part that God's talking about he's
[42:35] talking about when listen Marie God
[42:38] didn't God didn't write the word Pope he
[42:44] didn't write it down on paper he saw
[42:48] people and the way they acted and the
[42:52] word they would receive and what they
[42:54] would do with him when they got it
[42:57] it didn't say in the beginning God wrote
[42:59] the word yes it in the beginning was the
[43:02] word and the words eternal you can't
[43:05] write it down how can you write
[43:07] something down this eternal man has done
[43:09] just that's the best that we can do but
[43:12] you know what that's the best to get us
[43:14] out of here that's the best to get us
[43:16] out of here and once that gets us out of
[43:19] here then that message of cheer it's not
[43:23] another book brother branham you write a
[43:26] revelation chapter 23 he said sounds
[43:29] good
[43:30] he said but watch it if you add a word
[43:34] or take a word out say they were trying
[43:36] to teach said they were trying to trap
[43:38] me but that sounded good but we're not
[43:41] writing a new Bible
[43:42] we're already written epistles right no
[43:46] one in read of all men so let's go to
[43:48] Matthew 17 let's read this because we
[43:51] know the dishes were going to restore
[43:53] and we were talking about last Sunday
[43:55] and we had lifted up their eyes they saw
[43:57] no man save Jesus only and as they came
[44:00] down from the mountain Jesus charged
[44:01] them saying tell the vision to no man
[44:04] now I didn't say tell the vision to no
[44:06] man think about this other day
[44:07] Jesus is not forbidden them to tell the
[44:10] vision he said tell the vision do not
[44:14] tell the vision until the Son of Man be
[44:17] risen again from the dead which is right
[44:19] now and its disciples asked him saying
[44:22] why then say the scribes did a lot
[44:24] Smurfs first come and jesus answered
[44:26] then to them a life's truly shall first
[44:31] come and restore all things and we were
[44:33] talking about the last Sunday that Jesus
[44:36] didn't come to restore he made a way he
[44:39] made a way for us to come back to be
[44:41] restored Elisha according to what God
[44:45] said Elisha was to come and restore all
[44:48] things no we know it's the Ministry of
[44:49] Jesus Christ but he came to a person he
[44:53] came to human flesh that's what I want
[44:56] you to see it it's hard for us too
[45:01] hard for us to realize that God's going
[45:05] to do this whole thing through human
[45:07] flesh everything he's doing he's doing
[45:10] it through human flesh and sometimes we
[45:14] go well I don't know but now it's all
[45:16] coming through human flesh your human
[45:18] ears are hearing what I said your human
[45:21] body brought you here and tomorrow
[45:25] you're going to think about maybe some
[45:28] things that were said today and that's
[45:30] going to what that's gonna spark you to
[45:32] go to here and go to here and then to
[45:34] watch this and to listen to that and to
[45:36] mold those things over in your mind
[45:38] don't you just sit sometimes and think
[45:40] about just one quote just take one quote
[45:43] I do sometimes one word you take one
[45:46] word and you go why do you say it the
[45:48] way you said it that way you know you do
[45:51] that and then you want there comes a
[45:52] scripture and then there comes a quote
[45:54] and then there comes a sermon out of the
[45:55] whole thing all right so that's the way
[45:58] we're looking at now let's go to proving
[45:59] his word I like this quote right here
[46:06] because we must see now that we're
[46:09] getting into the son of man we read this
[46:12] quote last Sunday but we're gonna read
[46:13] it again premiums were 1964 cuz I want
[46:19] you to see that it's been taught here
[46:22] many times but but the son of God
[46:26] dispensation was back in the church was
[46:28] in the church ages there's a son of man
[46:30] dispensation that we're looking at are
[46:32] in right now if you want to say that's
[46:35] different from any time except for when
[46:37] he walked on the face of the earth
[46:38] because he just he's going to tell
[46:40] you write here he'll reveal yourself in
[46:43] a different way you ready all right now
[46:47] after 1900 years with the church ages
[46:50] past brother branham we have the church
[46:52] age you're not supposed to be in one
[46:54] anyway if you brighten but you are in
[46:56] the characteristic of that church all
[46:58] right and all the things that he
[47:01] prophesied of Luther Wesley we just went
[47:03] through and seen it drawn out and the
[47:05] moon come down and drawed it out and the
[47:06] Lord brought it out on the board here
[47:08] for us and showed it and come down
[47:10] himself and confirmed it to be right
[47:12] after nineteen hundred years and were at
[47:15] the end of the Laodicean Church age he
[47:19] promised in Luke 17 30 that this same
[47:22] son of man he promised it would be
[47:25] revealed in the days like it was in
[47:28] Sodom upon the earth did he do it does
[47:33] it have to come to pass it's impossible
[47:35] now it doesn't say it's impossible to
[47:37] come to pass you hear what I'm saying
[47:38] he's saying it's impossible for it not
[47:40] to come to pass and he's picking up
[47:42] another thought now remember he come in
[47:44] three names now they have to be
[47:47] separated because there's different
[47:50] times for different names remember the
[47:52] the syrophoenician woman said son of
[47:57] David have mercy on me he never paid her
[48:00] any attention but when she said Lord
[48:03] that brought his attention why she had
[48:06] no she had no ties to him as the son of
[48:08] David amen so and it's not saying we
[48:11] don't have ties to him as the son of God
[48:13] but we don't have a - of a son of David
[48:15] but now brother Brad was going to tell
[48:17] us it's not the Son of God dispensation
[48:19] anymore it's the son of man dispensation
[48:21] now and then now remember he coming
[48:24] three names the son of man a prophet the
[48:27] son of God the spirit the son of David
[48:29] for the Millennium but in between this
[48:32] conjunction which is now now according
[48:35] to his own words in the days when the
[48:37] son of man shall be revealed reveal
[48:39] himself is what not son of God
[48:43] son of man will reveal his self in a
[48:47] different way different God no different
[48:53] display yeah
[48:54] different revelation I'm telling you
[48:56] what he said he will reveal himself in a
[48:59] different way all right till we read it
[49:04] we'll talk about that in just a minute
[49:05] oh wow let me read this one more coat
[49:07] one more quote number three Northy ones
[49:12] at the end time in the very day that the
[49:15] Son of Man is revealed revelations 10
[49:17] one two seven reading when you get home
[49:19] the seventh angels message opening up
[49:22] the seals now that's when the son of man
[49:25] he just told you that's when the Son of
[49:28] Man is to be revealed when the seven
[49:30] seals are opened up and every day of the
[49:34] Son of Man is revealed
[49:35] revelations 10 reading when you get home
[49:37] the seventh angels message opening up
[49:39] the seals that's the seventh angels
[49:41] message brother Dale has been covering
[49:42] it forever and ever and ever
[49:44] brother Browns message was not in the
[49:47] years of preparation it was not the
[49:49] reason when he said when Jesus spoke and
[49:52] said that Elijah will come and restore
[49:54] all things sure that's part of
[49:56] restoration but if he didn't preach
[49:59] those seals he we're looking for
[50:01] somebody else
[50:02] but he did and he opened them and
[50:04] they're here and they're for us what is
[50:07] it not the angel is the son of man but
[50:09] the messenger is revealing the son of
[50:11] man can you get it separated now that's
[50:13] where it seems to be so hard for you you
[50:15] seek not the son of man himself but the
[50:19] seventh angel seventh messenger is
[50:21] revealing to the public the Son of Man
[50:24] because it's what it's left to shut so
[50:26] now it is in full-grain because the son
[50:29] of man was the grain
[50:32] he can't organize it it's the grain
[50:35] itself again so not but now look not the
[50:40] son of man himself so brother Branham
[50:42] was not the son of man we know that and
[50:44] we know one thing's for sure the Son of
[50:46] Man the flesh God will not show itself
[50:50] on this earth until the Millennium so
[50:54] it's got to be a revelation it's got to
[50:57] be a revelation among the people showing
[51:00] the same sign showing the same thing
[51:02] brother Branham and I wrote myself a
[51:04] note see remember the healing campaign
[51:07] was a temporary
[51:08] resurrection sign that was your
[51:10] resurrection sign that was the sign this
[51:12] listen nobody had ever done I was
[51:14] thinking this morning while brother
[51:16] Martin was preaching you know he gave
[51:18] those disciples the ability to pray for
[51:22] the sick cast out Devils
[51:24] do you read something that was left out
[51:26] though heal sick raise the dead cast out
[51:30] demons nothing about salvation told you
[51:34] couldn't happen they can't save him
[51:36] nobody Jesus Christ never saved nobody
[51:38] hey man not while he was on earth right
[51:42] he saw all the thief on the cross the
[51:44] thief on the cross wouldn't paradise the
[51:47] kingdom Jesus was preaching is when he
[51:49] said the least in the kingdom is greater
[51:50] than John that was the Holy Ghost that
[51:53] come in to the believers on the day of
[51:54] Pentecost I want us to see that that's
[51:57] when salvation - truly - the bride began
[52:01] was today at Pentecost that was what
[52:04] Jesus give his life for was so he could
[52:07] take that life and put it back into the
[52:10] people amen
[52:15] and that started the bride on the day of
[52:18] Pentecost started the bride the thief on
[52:21] the cross even Jesus he was so precise
[52:23] he didn't say today you'll be with me in
[52:25] the sixth dimension he said today you'll
[52:28] be with me in paradise where the other
[52:29] ones were from the Old Testament he was
[52:34] close he was read him close but he
[52:37] didn't he was not a child of the kingdom
[52:42] he was given heater imparted eternal
[52:45] life just like a lot of them in the Old
[52:46] Testament will be imparted eternal life
[52:48] but if you don't have the if you don't
[52:51] have the new birth now you're just gonna
[52:54] have to hope to get one
[52:56] please don't hope please don't hope but
[53:05] I told them this morning I said look we
[53:07] must understand what God has already
[53:08] said about us we were talking about
[53:10] judgment because I read you the
[53:13] scriptures and I'm gonna read it to you
[53:14] again that we're gonna judge the world
[53:16] right and I told them to do you know one
[53:20] thing's for sure
[53:21] that if you judge the world and you
[53:24] judge angels do you know that what
[53:27] happens is and I drew a line there's a
[53:29] mark against people all right
[53:34] the people that are let me explain this
[53:37] the people that are going to come up to
[53:38] the judgment bar have some kind of mark
[53:40] against them yeah that okay they will
[53:43] have something in their life a mark
[53:45] against them but do you know what those
[53:48] people standing in judgment here me
[53:52] people if you can't stand in at the
[53:56] white throne judgment and be a judge and
[53:58] have one mark half a mark or even a dot
[54:02] your pure perfect sinless bride of Jesus
[54:08] Christ how can you judge and have a mark
[54:11] against you these people are going to
[54:13] have a mark against them that's why they
[54:15] have to come to judgment there has to be
[54:16] a just God you may think how beautiful
[54:19] God is God is beautiful but he's also a
[54:22] judge amen he's a just God that's why
[54:28] he's called the justifier do you know
[54:31] what that word justified remember what
[54:33] brother Bram said about the form that
[54:35] we're talking about now is the real you
[54:37] didn't do it because remember justified
[54:39] is that you did something and then God
[54:42] forgive you or whatever mourn that
[54:43] you're justified not with God now that's
[54:46] not back here these people back here in
[54:49] the forum we stand at the white throne
[54:52] judgment we never did it even though an
[54:56] accuser could walk up listen to me an
[55:00] accuser could walk up and god forbid it
[55:04] say you you had a let's just say you had
[55:06] a soirée with a woman back when you were
[55:11] 16 years old and she's now Melissa and
[55:13] she walks up and she goes what's he
[55:15] doing up there right because she's in
[55:19] judgment she's standing in judgment she
[55:22] has a mark against her that that's not
[55:23] it
[55:24] but you know what God's gonna tell her
[55:26] God's gonna say if you would have done
[55:28] what they did if you would have done
[55:31] what they did I'd have done the same
[55:33] thing to you
[55:34] you that I did to them I have done the
[55:39] same thing it was your choice lady our
[55:42] man whatever one it was your choice to
[55:44] stand where you're standing they chose
[55:46] to take my justification they chose to
[55:51] take what I said and now they're covered
[55:53] they're not just covered they never did
[55:55] it hey by alright with that
[56:02] all right let's get to get back to our
[56:07] point now let's go to what do we read
[56:10] number yeah we read number three let's
[56:12] do read number four but you see how see
[56:16] we haven't really dug into real
[56:17] justification cuz I'm telling you you
[56:22] think about that if you're standing with
[56:25] the judge you can't have a mark against
[56:29] you you can't those who is justified
[56:31] he's already glorified that's my point
[56:34] if you take that justification that's
[56:37] what will change your body because you
[56:40] have a mark against you and it's your
[56:42] body your physical brain that says I
[56:44] can't do it right we know you came but
[56:49] if you let him if you let God wash that
[56:52] thing away cuz remember he puts it in
[56:54] the scene never remembers it again so he
[56:56] can't she's telling him something he
[56:58] don't know right hello I've got you
[57:02] quiet she's telling me or him whatever
[57:05] that March she's telling him he don't
[57:07] even know it but that's what he's gonna
[57:11] say he said lady if you would accepted
[57:12] me like they did I had to wash George
[57:14] away too but Christ was waived on the
[57:21] day of Pentecost when they came a sound
[57:23] from heaven like a waving mighty rushing
[57:25] wind and was waved over the people the
[57:27] Pentecostal people that was up at
[57:29] Pentecost waiting for the blessings to
[57:31] come and to be waved again we realized
[57:34] in the last day according to Luke 1730
[57:38] in the Sunday again in the day that the
[57:41] Esso end of man will be revealed are
[57:44] waved over the people now remember that
[57:47] dispensation
[57:48] was not waved over the people during the
[57:50] church ages hmm I just read you I just
[57:55] read where it says son of man son of God
[57:58] son of David I want to go back to that
[58:01] quote cuz I miss them but we'll go back
[58:03] to in a minute and the dates the Son of
[58:05] Man will be revealed or wave began over
[58:07] the people now who is the son of man in
[58:10] the beginning was the Bible no in the
[58:12] beginning was the word the Word was with
[58:14] God and the Word was God and the Word
[58:17] was made flesh and dwelt among us and if
[58:21] all the teaching that we have and
[58:22] confirmation of the Word of God by Word
[58:26] of God by signs by wonders we see today
[58:28] that in the Book of Luke here that as we
[58:30] just quoted from art Luke 2:17 chapter
[58:35] look up thank you come on oh well and
[58:40] the 30th verse in Malachi 4 in two
[58:41] different scriptures we're acquainted
[58:43] with that that word again is waved over
[58:45] the people that the dead traditions of
[58:48] man is dead and the Son of God is alive
[58:50] among again again with the baptism of
[58:53] the Holy Spirit because the Son of God
[58:55] is the baptism of the holy God okay
[58:58] Alive again with the baptism of the Holy
[59:01] Spirit right among us and it's giving us
[59:03] life as Christ was the first one to
[59:06] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[59:09] although topped in many places he was
[59:11] the firstfruits of those that slept in
[59:13] the bride coming of Christ coming out of
[59:15] the church he there the bride coming of
[59:18] Christ coming out of the church they'll
[59:19] have to be a sheaf waving again in the
[59:22] last days what there has to be a
[59:24] ministry to say that there is of someone
[59:26] coming to maturity but now the whole
[59:28] field can come the whole field can now
[59:31] come to maturity but I want ask you a
[59:34] question who planted the wheat we've
[59:43] talked about that brother ray we talked
[59:46] about this this is a whole field and
[59:48] they've come up this high without the
[59:50] seed getting a girl who planted the seed
[59:54] it didn't just happen
[59:56] somebody had to plant to see
[59:59] somebody had to put that seed in the
[1:00:01] ground hey man so keep that in your mind
[1:00:05] for just a minute will tell you who that
[1:00:06] is
[1:00:07] excuse me now number five so that's the
[1:00:10] way it is again today God is calling his
[1:00:12] elected people I like this I'm going to
[1:00:14] keep this quote right here with me
[1:00:16] everywhere I go and they are elected now
[1:00:19] he's coming somebody else and now they
[1:00:22] are elected for what for a resurrection
[1:00:26] and what kind of a sign is he showing
[1:00:28] them resurrection son because he
[1:00:31] listened healing was a temporary
[1:00:33] resurrection brother branham's showed
[1:00:35] that the resurrection could come by the
[1:00:38] signs and the wonders the son of man
[1:00:40] showed the resurrection when he student
[1:00:42] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:00:43] Lord he had already done miracle by
[1:00:45] miracle by miracle by miracle by miracle
[1:00:48] by miracle he was showing them the sign
[1:00:51] that nobody had ever seen before sure
[1:00:54] you see this one coming up from the dead
[1:00:56] and you see this one but you don't see
[1:00:58] that many healings in the Old Testament
[1:01:00] do you know but when Jesus gets here
[1:01:04] he's like thousands that you don't even
[1:01:07] see in print that we're healed that you
[1:01:09] never know anything about because what
[1:01:11] one scripture I was reading in Matthew
[1:01:13] where they brought him to him all day he
[1:01:15] said all day and said the lame walking
[1:01:17] the sick was healed and the devils were
[1:01:18] cast out that wasn't recorded all in the
[1:01:22] Bible there was you know thousands of
[1:01:24] them but that resurrection sign and sure
[1:01:27] they were healings listened though there
[1:01:29] were healings and signs and wonders
[1:01:31] through the church ages but never in one
[1:01:34] ministry like there was in brother
[1:01:36] Branham never just in one ministry but
[1:01:38] now remember that wasn't all because
[1:01:41] there was a message hook to it
[1:01:44] remember this was debate the healing was
[1:01:48] debate on the hook what was the hook the
[1:01:52] hook was the resurrection son the hook
[1:01:54] was us getting a body change that was
[1:01:58] the hook that was hidden by the bait but
[1:02:02] you know what happened they went after
[1:02:04] the bait and never took the hook some of
[1:02:09] them didn't we see when brother Brennan
[1:02:11] passed away they all went back to the
[1:02:12] denomination
[1:02:13] well that wasn't the hook that wasn't
[1:02:15] the hook the hook was this message in
[1:02:17] its pure form what was he showing them
[1:02:21] then a delivering sign to deliver them
[1:02:23] from the bondage a sign of power that
[1:02:26] could shut to heaven and could block the
[1:02:28] skies and he's showing the power of the
[1:02:31] resurrection of his son living among
[1:02:33] them to resurrect him from this grave in
[1:02:35] graveyard that we're in to the land that
[1:02:38] he's promised to us resurrection sign
[1:02:40] calling out of spiritual Egypt and
[1:02:43] spiritual Babylon so he was showing the
[1:02:46] resurrection signed by healing the sick
[1:02:48] raising the dead but what he was doing
[1:02:50] was he was actually bringing us to a
[1:02:52] spiritual resurrection I'd rather be
[1:02:56] spirit if you're not spiritually
[1:02:58] resurrected first you're not going to
[1:03:00] have an actual resurrection except for
[1:03:02] about a thousand so years from now
[1:03:04] general resurrection and you're gonna
[1:03:06] have to stand with the mark against Jim
[1:03:08] he's talking about calling out of
[1:03:10] spiritual Egypt and spiritual Babylon
[1:03:14] and what was he doing when he was here
[1:03:16] he was trying to call them out of the
[1:03:19] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[1:03:21] Herodians and all he was trying to call
[1:03:22] that group out everybody and watch let's
[1:03:30] read number six super Sun we've had all
[1:03:36] these things the path of abraham's royal
[1:03:38] seed but just before the destroying of
[1:03:40] the world the super sign must appear
[1:03:42] again an eternal everlasting
[1:03:45] resurrection sign that proves that the
[1:03:48] royal seat could not be killed like
[1:03:49] daniel like the rest of the prophets was
[1:03:51] they're all dead all prophets are dead
[1:03:53] all right all the prophets are dead
[1:03:57] everybody there's nothing left but us
[1:03:59] the grave couldn't hold him because the
[1:04:01] other the others conquered the gates of
[1:04:04] the enemies such as fire and lines and
[1:04:06] swords so forth they conquered that but
[1:04:09] this royal seed conquered death hell and
[1:04:11] the grave nothing could hold him why
[1:04:13] he's an everlasting super son what is a
[1:04:16] super sign the resurrection of Jesus
[1:04:18] Christ after being dead for 2,000 years
[1:04:22] still stands in the midst of us the same
[1:04:25] as he did then manifest
[1:04:26] himself in his church in human flesh
[1:04:31] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:04:34] forever human flesh human flesh human
[1:04:40] how many times now to skip to all this
[1:04:43] let's go to Jobe go over to where the
[1:04:48] job the ones we read last last week Jobe
[1:04:53] 14 verse 10 so man lies down to rise
[1:04:58] it's not till the heavens be no more
[1:05:00] they shall not awake nor be raised out
[1:05:02] of their sleep oh that that would hide
[1:05:05] me in the grave that I would have keep
[1:05:06] me with us keep me secret until thy
[1:05:09] wrath be passed and that's how would
[1:05:10] it's to point me at that time and
[1:05:12] remember me if a man die shall he live
[1:05:16] again all the days of my appointed time
[1:05:18] will I wait till my change comes thou
[1:05:22] shalt call and I will answer thee thou
[1:05:26] wilt have a desire to the work of that
[1:05:29] hence I will wait till my change come
[1:05:36] that will call and our answer how about
[1:05:43] that where's that call gonna come from
[1:05:46] yeah we'd better start looking at this a
[1:05:53] little bit different job 19 why do you
[1:05:56] persecute me as God and are not
[1:05:57] satisfied with my flesh all that my
[1:05:59] words were now retinyl that they were
[1:06:01] printed in a book that they were graving
[1:06:03] with an iron pen and lead in the rock
[1:06:05] forever for I know that my Redeemer
[1:06:07] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[1:06:09] latter day upon the earth and though
[1:06:14] after my skin worms destroy this body
[1:06:16] yet in my flesh shall I see God yet in
[1:06:21] my flesh I shall see God
[1:06:23] and look how personal a revelation this
[1:06:26] job is saying I don't know if anybody
[1:06:30] else is gonna see this but whom I shall
[1:06:33] see for myself and mine eyes shall
[1:06:35] behold and not another in other words
[1:06:40] overstaying now look this is not some
[1:06:42] kind of general resurrection no this is
[1:06:47] he's going to get one right when I shall
[1:06:49] see for myself and mine eyes shall
[1:06:51] behold and not another though my rains
[1:06:54] be consumed within me now let's go to
[1:06:57] job 33 yea his soul draws near into the
[1:07:00] grave and his life to the destroyer if
[1:07:03] there be a messenger with him an
[1:07:05] interpreter one among a thousand to show
[1:07:10] unto man his uprightness folks that's
[1:07:15] what's happening that's what's happening
[1:07:18] right now you're getting a message from
[1:07:21] a messenger not me but a messenger an
[1:07:25] interpreter one among a thousand to show
[1:07:30] unto man his uprightness then he is
[1:07:34] gracious unto him and said deliver him
[1:07:36] from going down to the pit I have found
[1:07:39] a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than
[1:07:43] a child he shall return to the days of
[1:07:47] his youth there's your body changed in
[1:07:49] the Old Testament the oldest book in the
[1:07:51] Bible so that would be one of the oldest
[1:07:56] revelations you know of what was written
[1:07:58] in the Bible there's a body change he
[1:08:02] shall return to the days and that's not
[1:08:05] all I've got a few more but I just want
[1:08:06] to use that one so let's go who is this
[1:08:08] son of man just for about ten minutes
[1:08:10] and then we'll start right on the son of
[1:08:12] man next Sunday scrolling on that who is
[1:08:16] this son of man members brother Branham
[1:08:19] said who is this son of man what'd he do
[1:08:20] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:08:23] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:08:26] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:08:29] not to Bible not to written letter it's
[1:08:36] not there cuz remember let me put this
[1:08:43] the right way there's a lot of fill-in
[1:08:45] in this Bible there's a lot of fill-in
[1:08:49] there's a lot of fill-in things that
[1:08:52] were said
[1:08:54] that I guess you might not mean anything
[1:08:57] to me but you know the old war stories
[1:08:59] of this one and that one beyond but it
[1:09:01] has a meaning but remember the word made
[1:09:04] flesh was Jesus Christ so if you're born
[1:09:08] again today you're the word made flesh
[1:09:09] so your journey is not verbatim that's
[1:09:13] what I'm trying to say your journey is
[1:09:14] not verbatim in the Bible but I'll
[1:09:16] guarantee you you can look into this
[1:09:18] word and you can see your journey
[1:09:21] because the rimbor the whole Bible was
[1:09:23] given to us for an example but now
[1:09:26] remember examples can not always be
[1:09:29] reality you and I are reality we're
[1:09:32] human flesh like we were talking
[1:09:35] downstairs there's a parable well a
[1:09:38] parable is maybe about something and it
[1:09:42] has an underlying meaning but there's a
[1:09:44] person that lives through that you can
[1:09:46] have a parable of this like we're going
[1:09:47] to talk about a parable right here
[1:09:49] Matthew that's what then let's keep
[1:09:54] reading this I got ahead of myself the
[1:09:56] same was in the beginning with God all
[1:09:57] things were made by him he didn't need a
[1:10:00] book he didn't need a book to write it
[1:10:03] down all things were made by him without
[1:10:06] him was not anything made that was made
[1:10:08] in him was life and the life was a lot
[1:10:11] of men and the light shines in darkness
[1:10:13] and the darkness comprehended it not
[1:10:15] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:10:17] was John now this John the Baptist we
[1:10:19] know that the same came for a witness to
[1:10:21] bear witness of the light that all men
[1:10:24] through him might believe he was not
[1:10:26] that light brother Branham quote fits
[1:10:30] right in with that he was not the Son of
[1:10:32] man he's revealing the son of man
[1:10:34] brother Branham was revealing the Son of
[1:10:36] Man so John was what he was introducing
[1:10:40] the son of man hey listen brother Ram
[1:10:42] said he was one of the most important
[1:10:44] because he was trying to introduce
[1:10:45] something that they thought was Jehovah
[1:10:47] God way up here that nobody can see that
[1:10:49] was that was just so awesome which he
[1:10:52] was but now he had come right down into
[1:10:54] a baby and then grown up and he was
[1:10:56] looking at John he saw a God in human
[1:10:59] flesh John was not that light but was
[1:11:04] sent to bear witness of that life the
[1:11:07] was the true light which lighteth every
[1:11:09] man that cometh into the world he was in
[1:11:11] the world and the world was made by him
[1:11:13] in the world and knew him not there was
[1:11:16] a song on radio now I really like but
[1:11:19] the song portrays one of the verses in
[1:11:23] the song says on a hill that you created
[1:11:26] you gave your life on a hill that you
[1:11:30] create God create gotten you where that
[1:11:32] dog off the hill with that he created it
[1:11:34] he knew he'd be someday still hanging on
[1:11:37] that same very hill that he created he
[1:11:41] created the tree that he hung on
[1:11:44] he created the ore and the metals to
[1:11:47] make the nails it putting in his hand he
[1:11:51] created the bush you made the thorns
[1:11:54] what a mighty God we serve
[1:11:56] amen he was in the world in the world
[1:12:00] was made by him and the world knew him
[1:12:03] not he came into his own and his own
[1:12:05] received in not but as many as received
[1:12:08] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:12:12] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:12:15] his name which were born not of blood
[1:12:18] nor the will of the flesh had to be a
[1:12:21] conversion here somewhere so that's your
[1:12:24] first birth the will of the flesh was
[1:12:29] your first birth hello he's talking
[1:12:32] about your second birth here which was
[1:12:34] born not of blood nor of the will of
[1:12:36] flesh nor the will of man but of God and
[1:12:39] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:12:42] us and we beheld his glory the glory of
[1:12:44] the only begotten of the Father full of
[1:12:47] grace and truth alright now let's go to
[1:12:51] Matthew one and just bring in a little
[1:12:54] point here because that's what we're
[1:12:55] talking about last Sunday now the birth
[1:12:57] of Jesus Christ is on this was this was
[1:12:59] cuz this who is this son of man the son
[1:13:02] of man is a God
[1:13:03] is God in human flesh alright because
[1:13:08] truly when that was the point I was
[1:13:09] gonna make a minute ago when brother
[1:13:10] Branham talks about the three
[1:13:12] dispensations brother Dale used to have
[1:13:14] him on the wall around here a long time
[1:13:15] ago some of you remember he had him
[1:13:18] written on the wall he's not very good
[1:13:21] artist
[1:13:21] but we can still see what he's talking
[1:13:22] about well you had him written on the
[1:13:25] wall because the first dispensation
[1:13:27] really was a son of God the Creator God
[1:13:30] was the son of God right here
[1:13:33] then he come through the Old Testament
[1:13:35] then he became the son of man God in
[1:13:38] human flesh then he what he ascended
[1:13:41] came back as the Son of God in the seven
[1:13:44] Church ages and then come back again as
[1:13:46] the Son of Man that way all right with
[1:13:48] that because the son of god is the
[1:13:51] creator god that's what who we just
[1:13:52] talked about right there in the
[1:13:53] beginning was the word
[1:13:54] where was what garden word was god that
[1:13:56] was the son of god the creator the one
[1:13:58] who created all things can I get amen
[1:14:11] now the birth of Jesus was on this wise
[1:14:13] when is his mother Mary was espoused to
[1:14:16] Joseph before they came together she was
[1:14:18] found with child of the Holy Ghost maybe
[1:14:20] we were talking about last Sunday that's
[1:14:24] why Christ had to be burped had to come
[1:14:26] like that because in our second birth
[1:14:29] were not birthed by her natural father
[1:14:31] we're birthed by the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost gives us in your birth amen but
[1:14:36] now the Holy Ghost gives us new birth
[1:14:37] brings what the son of God right into
[1:14:43] you to birth you into the kingdom of
[1:14:46] heaven then all right then Joseph her
[1:14:51] husband being a just man not willing to
[1:14:52] make her public examples - put it away
[1:14:54] probably but while he thought on these
[1:14:56] things behold the angel the Lord
[1:14:57] appeared on him in a dream and said
[1:14:58] Joseph now son of David fear not to take
[1:15:00] Mary thou my wife for that which is
[1:15:02] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:05] now you're not gonna have the same foot
[1:15:07] say the same thing you and I gotta say
[1:15:12] the same thing that which is conceived
[1:15:15] in us her the bride is of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:19] amen but now watch though that's one
[1:15:23] dispensation that's the son of God
[1:15:27] dispensation you and I are in something
[1:15:31] different I just read you the quote
[1:15:32] we've got already got the baby here
[1:15:35] we've already should come to some kind
[1:15:37] of maturity and we've already got the
[1:15:39] man standing on earth mature statue a
[1:15:43] perfect man God in human flesh in a
[1:15:45] bride not a baby that doesn't say the
[1:15:48] statue of a perfect baby right that says
[1:15:53] it's not your perfect man so that which
[1:15:55] is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:57] she should bring forth the son shall
[1:15:58] call his name Jesus for he shall save
[1:16:00] his people from their sins no this was
[1:16:02] done that it might be fulfilled which
[1:16:03] was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet
[1:16:05] saying behold a virgin shall be with
[1:16:07] child and shall bring forth the son they
[1:16:10] shall call his name Emmanuel which being
[1:16:13] interpreted is God with us God came down
[1:16:18] in human flesh there was the son of man
[1:16:20] in a little baby but that son of man
[1:16:23] grew he never said he never called
[1:16:26] himself the Son of God he called himself
[1:16:28] the Son of Man because remember the son
[1:16:33] of God cannot be resurrected son God
[1:16:41] never went down the Son of God is the
[1:16:43] eternal how can you get somebody that
[1:16:45] created the every star you look up and
[1:16:48] see tonight God created them and
[1:16:51] billions more that you can't see amen
[1:16:56] that's perfection that we can't even
[1:16:59] think about so how can we say that
[1:17:02] wasn't Jesus one guard of the River
[1:17:04] Jordan and all these you know silly
[1:17:06] things that people say but anyway the
[1:17:08] Bible says he was born bring forth the
[1:17:11] son they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:17:12] which being interpreted God with us
[1:17:16] there was your sight there's your son of
[1:17:17] man now we know and listen I want you to
[1:17:22] understand something back in the Old
[1:17:24] Testament he would appear put on some
[1:17:26] human flesh milk has a dick he appeared
[1:17:31] to other people in a form now that
[1:17:36] wasn't beast on a man the son of man is
[1:17:39] Jesus Christ
[1:17:40] now what Moses saw was the back part of
[1:17:45] a man brother Ram said saw theophany
[1:17:48] theophany and said he later became Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ he later became Jesus Christ
[1:17:56] because Jesus Christ is this boy we're
[1:17:58] talking about right here the one that
[1:17:59] was conceived in Mary that's the son of
[1:18:02] man that all right
[1:18:04] that is the man that's the son of man
[1:18:08] God in human flesh now let's answer a
[1:18:13] question here and then we'll then we'll
[1:18:14] stop and then I'll start on the Son of
[1:18:16] Man again next Sunday but remember I
[1:18:19] talked to you about the we talked about
[1:18:21] the field right there was something
[1:18:25] growing in the field well how did that
[1:18:27] feel get there because without somebody
[1:18:29] planting it it ain't gonna come to
[1:18:31] maturity it's not gonna come to maturity
[1:18:33] without somebody having not put
[1:18:35] something in the ground so who put it in
[1:18:38] the ground
[1:18:39] the son of God no pull up the next one
[1:18:46] Matthew 13 he had already told him the
[1:18:50] parable of the sower of the seed but he
[1:18:52] never told him who it was now he's
[1:18:53] fixing to break it now alright you're
[1:18:56] okay with this he answered and said unto
[1:18:58] them he that soweth the good seed is the
[1:19:02] son of man the field is the world the
[1:19:08] good seed are the children of the
[1:19:11] kingdom but the tares are the children
[1:19:14] of the wicked one the enemy that sowed
[1:19:17] them is the devil we know that the
[1:19:19] harvest is in the world the reapers of
[1:19:20] the angels and we see all that now look
[1:19:22] verse 41 the Son of man shall send forth
[1:19:25] his angels because remember we're going
[1:19:28] to read it next Sunday
[1:19:30] Jesus stood one day and said the son of
[1:19:32] man can forgive sin hmm the Son of Man
[1:19:40] can you forgive sins on the earth come
[1:19:43] on that's what he said we're gonna read
[1:19:45] some of this later of the
[1:19:47] characteristics of the different things
[1:19:48] but the son of man shall send forth his
[1:19:50] angels and they shall gather out of his
[1:19:52] kingdom all things that offend and then
[1:19:54] which do iniquity catch them in the
[1:19:56] furnace so who's gonna be standing at
[1:19:58] the judgment who's who's the one with
[1:20:01] the white wig on
[1:20:02] yeah son of God it's not a man the son
[1:20:09] of man is the judge and so I don't know
[1:20:14] about that well let's go to let's go to
[1:20:17] Revelation
[1:20:18] let's get Matthew 16 I'll read it next
[1:20:20] Sunday we know that who do I say that
[1:20:22] the son of man say that I am I was in
[1:20:24] watch I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:20:26] Day and heard behind me a great voice of
[1:20:27] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[1:20:29] the first and the last
[1:20:31] what now see us write it in a book and
[1:20:33] send it to the seven churches which in
[1:20:35] Asia Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira
[1:20:37] Sardis Philadelphia I'm sorry brother
[1:20:39] now I mean breath nothing brother
[1:20:41] brother Hal sorry he says I get running
[1:20:43] too fast and he can't keep up with me
[1:20:45] sorry about it I'm sorry about that one
[1:20:47] he's trying to read you got it you got
[1:20:49] to do it like the top writer you got to
[1:20:50] do this and I turned to see the voice
[1:20:53] that spake with me and being turned I
[1:20:56] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[1:20:58] midst of the seven candlesticks one
[1:21:01] locking to the Son of man what's he
[1:21:05] looking at the church ages it's God in
[1:21:08] human flesh
[1:21:09] even back then they were God in human
[1:21:12] flesh they just didn't get the
[1:21:14] revelation of it until the end time you
[1:21:16] and I get the tremenda big the big
[1:21:19] revelation because you know what we're
[1:21:21] going to be able to see it in the word
[1:21:22] they couldn't see it in the word they
[1:21:25] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:21:27] they were safe that's that's their deal
[1:21:29] all right that was their box one lakh
[1:21:33] into the Son of Man clothed with a
[1:21:35] garment down to the foot and Girt about
[1:21:37] the paps with a golden girl so there's
[1:21:39] your bride form which is the son of man
[1:21:42] bride for him but now watch we missed
[1:21:44] one here he's had in his hair were white
[1:21:47] like wool go to Daniel 9 I'm dark Daniel
[1:21:53] 7 where the Ancient of Days comes with
[1:21:56] what with the wig wig is judgment but
[1:22:00] also what's this his head was like wool
[1:22:04] I want to snow his eyes where it's
[1:22:06] flames of fire his feet like unto fine
[1:22:09] brass what does the Bible call brass
[1:22:14] brass is always considered with joy
[1:22:17] so there's your righteous judge the Son
[1:22:20] of Man is the judge because what he come
[1:22:23] here he came here to give us an example
[1:22:26] and then he didn't just leave he come
[1:22:29] and got into you like brother Martin was
[1:22:32] saying that he got into you to live that
[1:22:34] same life and that's what the world's
[1:22:37] gonna be judged by the world the Bible
[1:22:40] you know brother the world whole world
[1:22:41] to be judged by Jesus Christ but he's
[1:22:43] he's just gonna be Jesus Christ standing
[1:22:45] there no it's gonna be the whole bride
[1:22:47] everybody's standing there with him none
[1:22:51] all right so who is this son of man in
[1:22:54] the beginning was the word in the
[1:22:56] beginning was to Genesis that's what I
[1:22:58] wrote my Bible in the beginning was a
[1:23:01] Genesis 1:26 man and the Genesis 1:26
[1:23:05] man was with God and the Genesis 1:26
[1:23:08] man was God and the Genesis 1:26 man was
[1:23:12] made flesh and dwelt among us a man so
[1:23:15] if you'll take it that way that's what
[1:23:17] that Genesis 1:26 man came down into
[1:23:20] human flesh one man but he didn't stop
[1:23:25] there he come back on the day of
[1:23:28] Pentecost as a hundred and twenty of
[1:23:31] those people 120 little Jesus's but they
[1:23:34] never had let stand our feet they never
[1:23:36] get ready for communion they never had
[1:23:38] though the revelation of who that man
[1:23:40] exactly was I said exactly you and I are
[1:23:44] going to pinpoint exactly who that man
[1:23:47] is because brother Brown said he'll
[1:23:48] become so visible among us to a raise
[1:23:51] the dead and go in the rapture well
[1:23:52] there's your whole key it's to bring the
[1:23:53] son of man bring the son of man visible
[1:23:57] where we can see them not not seeing
[1:23:59] with our eyes we can understand what
[1:24:02] we're doing here understand what our box
[1:24:06] is it's to get the dead out of the
[1:24:10] ground
[1:24:11] it's to preach the Word of God so alive
[1:24:14] until they'll want to come over here
[1:24:17] where we're at right now they don't want
[1:24:19] to come over here where we're at right
[1:24:21] because we haven't destroyed this but I
[1:24:23] promise you people the Bible says death
[1:24:26] will be destroyed
[1:24:26] one day we'll stand and we'll say all
[1:24:28] power in heaven earth
[1:24:29] been given unto me dead come out of the
[1:24:32] corner and we won't stand there boastful
[1:24:34] and we not gonna walk out there like
[1:24:36] Jesus said the Pharisees go out there
[1:24:37] and go I'm a fair saying I'm fixin to
[1:24:40] pray to God you know what Jesus said
[1:24:43] happened to don't you he said you go in
[1:24:45] your closet and you pray in secret and
[1:24:48] God will reward you openly we may be all
[1:24:52] at home praying one day and something
[1:24:56] struck earth and the Dead start coming
[1:24:59] among us I'm okay for it to happen in
[1:25:03] here but this would be a little easier
[1:25:05] than if we were all say if somebody was
[1:25:07] at work and they looked over and Robert
[1:25:09] Tatum walked through the wall walked
[1:25:11] through and since he because you know
[1:25:14] what they're gonna tell us they're gonna
[1:25:15] say it's time right Oh Rachel Marlowe
[1:25:19] coming he said it's time
[1:25:21] Gary Atkins said this time we've been
[1:25:23] waiting on y'all we've been waiting on
[1:25:25] y'all it's time and you know what it
[1:25:29] won't be able just a short length of
[1:25:31] time will be changed in a moment in the
[1:25:33] twinkling of an eye and then we'll take
[1:25:35] a ride let's bow our heads before we get
[1:25:38] started with with a service Lord we pray
[1:25:41] that what we said Lord has been pleasing
[1:25:44] to You Father we want our lives to fit
[1:25:48] that word so Lord as the Prophet said we
[1:25:51] read it not too long ago with the
[1:25:53] prophets said Lord just sheriff's off
[1:25:55] just take us where lambs Lord just shear
[1:25:58] us off bring us back Lord who are we
[1:26:00] supposed to be forgive us of our
[1:26:03] shortcomings and and the things we do
[1:26:06] Lord that's not pleasing to You Lord I
[1:26:10] know that we all have problems in their
[1:26:13] life but Lord as the son of man you said
[1:26:19] you came down here to seek and save
[1:26:20] those which are lost Lord not being lost
[1:26:24] in our soul but sometimes we get lost in
[1:26:26] the world we get lost in the things of
[1:26:27] family and of jobs and of different
[1:26:30] things Lord and we we get lost in that
[1:26:32] Lord just Center us back Center us back
[1:26:37] into your perfect wheel Lord we know you
[1:26:40] work in permissive will but Lord your
[1:26:42] perfect will is
[1:26:43] for us to come to a body change and
[1:26:45] that's where we're absolutely zeroed out
[1:26:47] and there is no mark against this that
[1:26:51] we come to that glorified condition Lord
[1:26:55] we're longing for that maybe as we were
[1:26:58] in Egypt as the children of Israel were
[1:27:00] in Egypt being a type the children of
[1:27:03] Israel lived several hundred years and
[1:27:05] they got really easy down in Egypt they
[1:27:08] were getting all they needed to eat they
[1:27:10] were getting all that sure they were
[1:27:12] still working but they were giving straw
[1:27:14] to make bricks and all these different

[1:28:43] to Corinthians in a word fat yeah I got
[1:28:48] it somewhere I got it marked in my Bible
[1:28:54] first Corinthians 13 yep all right here
[1:28:59] we go first Corinthians 13 verse 23 for
[1:29:05] I've received of the Lord that which I
[1:29:08] have also delivered unto you this is
[1:29:09] Paul speaking because remember he wasn't
[1:29:11] at the he wasn't at the table but he's
[1:29:14] what do you received from the Lord the
[1:29:16] Lord gave him a revelation of what went
[1:29:20] on and obviously could tell it better
[1:29:23] than the rest of them or he would have
[1:29:24] told you through some our God would have
[1:29:25] told us through somebody else
[1:29:26] privacy's of the Lord that once I also
[1:29:28] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:29:30] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:29:32] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:29:34] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:29:37] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:29:40] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:29:43] also he took the cup and when he had
[1:29:45] supped saying this cup is the New
[1:29:46] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:29:50] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:29:54] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:29:55] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[1:29:57] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:30:01] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:30:02] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:30:05] body and blood of the Lord you know he's
[1:30:08] even people in the message I hate to
[1:30:10] tell you but it says for as often as you
[1:30:12] eat this bread and drink this cup you
[1:30:13] just show the Lord's death till he comes
[1:30:15] well they think the Son of man came in
[1:30:18] 1963 so they don't have to take
[1:30:20] communion anymore now that's not what
[1:30:21] the Bible says that's that's carnal
[1:30:24] that's carnal impersonation that's
[1:30:26] carnal ideas on the scripture no we're
[1:30:30] going to take this until the body change
[1:30:33] and then we'll get to take it at the
[1:30:35] marriage supper and richardroberts you
[1:30:39] can drink the biggest cup of wine you
[1:30:41] want to if you want but but you can have
[1:30:43] it it's all yours
[1:30:44] wheresoever or for whosoever shall eat
[1:30:47] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:30:48] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:30:50] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:30:52] examine himself all of us examine
[1:30:57] ourselves and so let him eat of that
[1:30:59] bread and drink of that Cup so if we
[1:31:01] examine ourselves we can eat and drink a
[1:31:03] little you see in here for he is and
[1:31:06] wrinkles unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:31:08] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:31:10] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:31:13] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:31:15] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:31:17] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:31:21] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:31:23] be condemned with the world see see
[1:31:27] brothers and sisters if you're born
[1:31:28] again today you're not judged with the
[1:31:30] world you've been taken out of that
[1:31:33] judgment there'll be no judgment of you
[1:31:36] in the world if you're born again your
[1:31:39] your ticket has been punched you you get
[1:31:42] an automatic taste of glory so why are
[1:31:47] we then pushing it that way let's have
[1:31:51] some fun with it now hey man let's don't
[1:31:54] push it that way let's have fun with it
[1:31:55] and what I mean by fun let's be being
[1:31:58] the Lord wherefore my brother when you
[1:31:59] come together eat tearing one for
[1:32:02] another whip mother says we're not
[1:32:04] condemned with the world if you're born
[1:32:06] again like I said what a glorious thing
[1:32:08] because the world has a condemnation
[1:32:10] that the Bible written that even Jesus
[1:32:12] spoke up that we can't stop George
[1:32:16] Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every
[1:32:18] place in this nation this nation turned
[1:32:22] to prophet down in 1956 she's doomed
[1:32:24] there's nothing will bring her back but
[1:32:27] see you say well I'm an American sure
[1:32:29] I'm an American amen I'm not gonna I'm
[1:32:31] not I'm gonna stand and salute the flag
[1:32:33] and all these things that's fine because
[1:32:35] I honor the nation but I'm not going to
[1:32:39] take part in her condemnation right you
[1:32:42] and I have been called out of that
[1:32:43] condemnation hey boy that ought to make
[1:32:45] you feel good
[1:32:47] wherefore my brother when you come
[1:32:49] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:32:51] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:32:52] home that you coming out together in the
[1:32:54] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:32:55] order when I come let's bow our heads
[1:32:58] just for a minute unless Terry property
[1:33:01] God said pray for your pastor and your
[1:33:02] pastor pray for you so let's do that
[1:33:15] that's just Lord in Jesus name Amen
[1:33:18] the Bible City took bread and blessed
[1:33:20] him or Jesus this bread has been made
[1:33:24] for one purpose and one purpose on it
[1:33:27] when we're finished with it
[1:33:28] Lord we'll take it home and burn it so
[1:33:30] it could never be used again that we'll
[1:33:33] have to make a new bread the next time
[1:33:36] we take communion and Father that shows
[1:33:38] Lord it shows that you we walk in
[1:33:40] newness of life with you every day Lord
[1:33:43] there's dying out Lord of the things
[1:33:45] that we do but Lord we don't have to die
[1:33:47] in our soul if we're born again Lord
[1:33:49] you've already give us eternal life and
[1:33:52] we're standing here in Lord taking this
[1:33:55] bread as a commemoration of the body
[1:33:57] that hung on Calvary that was broken up
[1:34:00] not in broken bones but was mashed and
[1:34:04] and all that where we didn't even know
[1:34:06] that you look like a human as the
[1:34:08] brother said today there was no skin
[1:34:09] hardly left on your body
[1:34:11] Lord you did that for me you did that
[1:34:14] for me Lord and I appreciate that and as
[1:34:16] we break this bread Lord we think of
[1:34:18] that that you dying and suffering on
[1:34:20] Calvary that by your stripes we are
[1:34:23] already healed amen
[1:34:28] by the stripes
[1:34:30] we're already healed it's not we're
[1:34:32] going to be we're already healed already
[1:34:38] healed
[1:34:39] I believe that then we have seen people
[1:34:44] take communion and be healed
[1:34:47] why because you take this right here and
[1:34:50] if you're if you'll do a little bit of
[1:34:52] study the the bread that they use in
[1:34:56] Israel
[1:34:58] it's called matzah or much so and it's a
[1:35:04] piece of bread like this on eleven but
[1:35:06] it has stripes in it about ever a couple
[1:35:10] of centimeters they put a stripe down it
[1:35:12] to commemorate the stripes that Christ
[1:35:16] took at Calvary and you know what they
[1:35:21] put it in there for some other purpose
[1:35:24] because they didn't believe Jesus Christ
[1:35:26] died on the cross
[1:35:27] so what a what a supernatural thing that
[1:35:30] God whatever machine they use they run
[1:35:33] stripes in it and it looks just like the
[1:35:35] stripes on the back they're brown and it
[1:35:37] looks like a stripe that you put on your
[1:35:39] back God's gonna have a witness he will
[1:35:44] have a witness they doesn't matter man
[1:35:46] came to nine we deny him all we want to
[1:35:48] God's gonna have a witness to Heavenly
[1:35:50] Father thank you for this wine Lord it's
[1:35:53] been through a process now that come
[1:35:55] from a grape now - Lord something that
[1:35:59] will excuse me if it it will never go
[1:36:02] bad Lord it's something that won't that
[1:36:04] will just keep getting better and better
[1:36:05] in it as the Holy Spirit a symbol that
[1:36:08] it just keeps working you can watch it
[1:36:10] in that in that pot that we put it in
[1:36:13] you can see it working and working and
[1:36:14] working well Lord that's working of the
[1:36:17] Holy Ghost in our life father's we take
[1:36:19] this communion as we eat the bread and
[1:36:21] drink this wine Lord may it absolutely
[1:36:24] heal us Lord and absolutely give us a
[1:36:27] refilling of the Holy Ghost as we take
[1:36:29] these things Lord we know they're just
[1:36:31] symbols but Lord it represents you and
[1:36:34] anything represents you I'll take father
