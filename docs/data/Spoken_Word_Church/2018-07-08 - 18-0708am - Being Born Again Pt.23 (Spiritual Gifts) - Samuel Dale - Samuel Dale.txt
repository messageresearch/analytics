you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever alright now we go to Malachi 4 we'll start with verse 2 Malachi 4 went into you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up his calves in the stall and yet and ye shall tread down now I wish you would look sometimes how many years and many times it's speaking about what we'll do there of course you know it's got and you shall tread down the wicked for there shall be ashes under the soles of your feet and the day that I shall do this says the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with the curse you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to try to cover as much as we can this morning but we will be dealing with the same thing all day today you know because we're at the position and then the Lord willing maybe after this evening we will start into the covering about the virtues and you know what they are and what takes place and things so you just start reading in that room of understanding of this other statue of a perfect man and you know kind of pay close attention we're like brother branham's on virtue he said now that's not gonna live in a virgin life well he's really what he's saying don't get so much natural because you take the word virgin see and you put it on in your wind up with the wrong way see of following what the real meaning of those scriptures are he wasn't against and nobody would begin the fact of you supposed to be a virgin you know that's that's the thing that's supposed to be but that's not what it's talking about there just be one I'll say it this way for we get to it I've seen a lot of women that were our girls maybe that were virgins but we're meanest rattlesnake right so you kind of see the wavy Cohen you know maybe the meaning is a rattlesnake but they may be virgin but that's not exactly then what it's talking about in the statue of a perfect man there see so you see right around him when he said something you just think about what he's saying and then little hole come in to view all right - I want us to think this morning especially trying to just to get a thought and then receiving we're going to read I gave them 33 quotes for used all right good to see it'll be back there with it and and we're going to try to read a lot this afternoon because that way then you have to say well the Prophet said it you know all right see then that way we'd have the understanding but what I want us to thank this morning I want to thought in your mind like this you know we say well those people are not in the message you know we say that's her show with our they're not in the message well you know that may be true yeah you know that may be true but yet why do we spend so much time on that when maybe I could go or I was explaining to my wife a little bit yesterday about it I could go over there today and I could preach a message that's kind of us swinging off of a Baptist Church and I could preach a message of one God to those people just not say brother Branham say it does not get into certain thing and especially not mention the water baptism you know and not be outlandish about my statements of of you know they're off the word so you just kind of bring it a message and you know what those people would accept it they would say men won't say that's right you know man I enjoyed that I was that's a good thought because their concept is one god of the Baptist Church all right but see then when you start saying some things onto it then they catch on to what you're doing well but now this is what I found among the believers of the message you just name your title and they're automatically against you I mean you just name your title now we're going to talk today on spiritual gifts that's what we're gonna talk on spiritual gifts alright see then anything I say listen you don't understand it you don't understand it we know this we know that about this but you instead of listening to what said the people have a preconceived idea about what you're saying and they turn it down before you ever even get to the message that you're trying to bring these over brother Dale we don't do that okay just making a point it might be good for us to pay close attention to the way things are said and what is said instead of trying to figure out what is saying we're gonna be owned today all right on announcement kind of thought then you pre conceived your idea and see how it fits we're going to be talking about that the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the science now we're gonna be on that realm and be talking on those things okay Jay all right now some see you'll back up before you ever listen to what is being said and then anything that said you'll automatically run it the wrong way all right but now think on those things kind of as we go along now remember this past Sunday that we were talking about we had got to the position of speaking about that these virtues that we read of in 2nd Peter add to your faith virtue or knowledge to enforce passive not that those things are required now it's down through the ages the Prophet said this groups not required what this is this group has not required what this is all right and that's true see because it was the amount of word that was there the Holy Spirit wasn't taken away it was the word that was ADA way the Holy Spirit was dark working in the church all right and see then in that they had their word for the age but we're not in the ages now we're supposed to be in the end time there's not supposed to be any ages now we're living in Lady ousia all right we're here but we're not supposed to be a part of Lady ousia each church age the bride of that age was birthed out of the age into the message of the hour that they were living nor did you follow it they were birthed out of that that new birth see Luther when he brought that message forth then it was required that those in that age to be a part of the bride was to be birthed by the same word or the word that Martin Luther brought because he brought the just shall live by faith all right see that was his basic now he preached all kind of messages and wrote commentaries and all kind of thing but yet his whole basic message was that's just shall live by faith well what would be the new birth of that age that's your shall live by faith all right we see then it it required more for the next because you come to Wesley were sanctification well all right what they had in Luther's age was the foundation or the part Wesley never come along Wesley come along teaching the same message Luther was teaching oh the just shall live by faith then he comes to America kind of got missionary minded in his ways and he comes to America and he runs into a group called the Moravians ever how you pronounce it and and they actually taught him a lot about sanctification we see they were not the messenger of the age the John Wesley was the messenger of the age so when John Wesley brought the message he never left justification he didn't say we don't need that no more he said I sister way I've come in other words he said I've come through Luther's message I've been a Christian all of these years of this that or the other through the doctrine of the just shall live by faith now we move into another age all right the same thing with the Zeus's treat okay oh I see then you wind up in this age there's not another age to come not another message to follow to to the Gentiles this is the end of it so then the end of all things has come upon us and it's required then that we as the Church of this age is required that we come to perfection through the word to the place that all that's behind us has been dependent upon it and see then that away brother Branham went all the way back course he went on back to Pentecost you know restoring the faith but when the point see he believed what Luther talked the truth he believed what Wesley thought he believed what is this a street talk of the truth amen see then he brought the message of this age which to tie up all the loose ends right he was to top all the loose ends and then in that would be the faith of the father's to be restored I think that would be the melikhaya that we read to turn the hearts of the John turned them to the New Testament message all right what he done he turned him to Jesus right cuz he really he didn't turn him he's just pointed right see we used the terminology as he turned it this away and then it's got to be turned back it's technically not turning he just John really just laid right and said there is the Lord Jesus Christ he introduced him all right see then that came in to the early church of that faith of the Lord Jesus Christ and the message he taught him all right see then Satan eat that away and it went down what's he in the end time it's coming back to where this message has pointed out Jesus Christ again just as John the Baptist pointed him then there is the faith of the fathers there's the message he pointed him to the truth or us to the you know mankind back dire to the truth because he pointed to Jesus Christ well what is the profit to burning us back to the word the original word that was given all right see then that's what the world waiting on Hebrews 11:40 right they without us cannot be made perfect okay see because we've come to the end time to understand the truth of the word of God and the world is waiting on you and I I didn't write the book you're supposed to be believing the prophets message if you want to get anything gets the message on adoption and read those and you'll see where that I'm talking about what I'm talking about other returning you know and bringing it all right we see then once we get turned to back to the faith of the fathers that's still not the fullness of their story it's got to go on and not stop there he's got to go home to a change of the body to bring back to the faith of the fathers I've always said it you might not understand the terminologies but if everybody in the world had the faith of the Father seven billion people with the faith of the father be a wonderful world to live in wouldn't but that would not be the finish because we would still be in human bodies see brother branham not only brought us to turn us back to the faith of the fathers but he went on in the message seek to bring the real his message began in the opening of the word of the seals in the time the others was restoration up until 63 there in the message he was doing restoration then his message come into view which was the seals than the things you know all right and it takes you all the way to the chains of the body because that way we're not looking for somebody else to come along all right now I'm just putting a point in then I want you to understand where I stand we're not looking for somebody to come along and have another message another great following another great move of that that's not to be now God is to come in and bring a rapture in all the things and I believe it a great outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the bride I believe that but as far as the world it's not going to be those things saying there's not another messenger to come to bring us some thing or secret thing to change these bodies Paul talked to the change of the body Paul described the change of the body but he's just couldn't attain unto it because it wasn't time but yet he told he said you're changing him on 120 you and I know that's a lie struck for the trumpet she'll say oh he put all of that into word for you and I to understand but see then we come that this end that's what I was getting on Sunday so I'm trying to get the point now that the point Sunday was what these virtues are required all right it's not something you just talk about the virtues are required all right they will be known already to get in a minute there'll be no rapture unless this message is brought forth by someone into reality all right the okay then see the bride being the final voice is that the words of your prophet the bride is to be the final voice to the final age all right so then I'm not looking for something else but neither am I looking for somebody to come along that can give us the great interpretation of the message I believe God I thought the message was bro and that God vindicated that that was the truth that's the way I stand you know he vindicated it to be the truth all right see then in doing that then these virtues we read in there that it's a requirement you realize the requirement of this age is to bring these things into manifestation not to just go to church and be good and live good and do this out of the other thing that's what people think they think it's just well you know we come into this message and it's just a little move upward of some kind of something no it's the end time everything is dependent upon whether or not this bride can reach that position all right see then you say well now this we've got a well everything you would talk about is going to be the bride is going to be involved no matter what praying or try to bring to this point it happened we're looking for this to happen it's still going to be the involvement of the bride because it's not one man to bring the whole time well now see I say words and you take me wrong and misinterpret but there's no scripture that said brother Branham is for the perfecting of the science now if it is I'd like to see the scripture it says the fivefold ministry is all right now it's time to not throw away our thoughts and ideas I've never said nothing I've never tried to interpret nothing to anybody about the end time of what it to be because that's left up to God but I can't at least say the parts that I know you know what I do know I do know the Bible says the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the science all right but now for sure of one thing the fivefold ministry does not have a message of her own now get that plane in your thoughts and we'll go through it today the fivefold ministry doesn't have a message of her own she has this message we're not trying to find some other secret coded something within the Word of God to make us get changed no this message has everything in it that you and I need because if not you got to look for something else but see the message has within it the things that we need and these that the message it will cover it we have over and over the the thing of being were that we can see the truth now I like statements brother Branham will make you know I like these kind of statements I like positive statements you know I hate that wishy-washy well what's your input under this what's your idea how do I do that's why I got 30-something quote you know I try to say what's the prophecy so you get into philosophies and people's ideas well what do you think it'll be either this is the life's message or you and I are in bad shuddhi one way or the other no we're standing in bad shape and we're 50 years down the road from the time with the profit leaving the same right these in I think it's about time to settle down to think about things and consider the day in the hour that we're living all right and follow these things all right there cannot be there cannot be a change of the body until someone reaches the faith for that it's all dependent and the bride being the life's voice to the life stage we're not looking for something else well you just don't understand this all right I probably don't but I understand one thing I can stand on water I believe okay I can stand in that position so then make sure you you follow all right see now watch what I'm getting at if it's true if it Hebrews 11:40 this is day without us cannot be made perfect huh now if that's true see then look at what's left for the end time people to do and to be don't you just go to church and be good people that's fine I mean that's good but that's not the whole story there's more than just going to church and being good well what do you think order do brother or not the world lives there's plenty of plenty of religious people in this world that their lives are marvelous their works are doing a lot of things and and you know they're doing wonderful things look at all of the money that's being sent overseas to run these places and do all this by the people that claim to be Christians so then that way you don't there's no way to to leave them out they have their place huh and see it's not to to try to say well we they're not they're not bringing the message they're not in the message right over there we're in the message well if someone preaches the truth once what's the point you know all right see then you today will well you know they're doing this and they're doing that well show me what they're doing it's not right you know what I mean that there there's good places there's good people in this world but a random never was against something like that he would call them Christians no they're not Christians because they don't believe this message well maybe they've never heard this message right maybe they've never heard the truth now what are you gonna do with them they're going to answer to God to what they have and they're doing in their own thoughts and idea they got to be put to do that but get the point now if we talk about these virtues are required you remember and I said this statement if they're in the word it's required it's not just in our haphazardly to just fulfilled it Peter was saying I'm a born-again Christian and I have like precious faith with those that are born again we said now we need to add this faith virtue or not you know we need all right now that would be the faith or revelation of the father's and that was what was eat away during the Dark Ages in the time Satan comes in we'll get to her bread around talking about he said you know you don't listen to what he's saying he said the people he said they don't they they don't teach that we need these things that they don't teach that we need these things right what's he saying but yet they're teaching it you know they're reading it they're proclaiming it they're putting it in into action as I said a lot of the churches are that make you and i ashamed of ourselves of the reality of the life that we live and walk in what's the difference well we have the word well when you come over into the message and it's perverting what's the difference and perverted word worse dire here hmm you know what I'm talking about how look at the end time and the ministry around the world until people will go 50 years preaching this message and then all the minute automatically just quit and just turn to some other thing maybe as I said their Sunday maybe some that brought you or was instrumental in bringing some of you to the message you think about where they are today that they've went back further than organized religion you know what most of them is doing they're going back to pull their own the light is in their own little groups and trying to build something of that order see then church listen maybe it's about time that we wake up to kind of think about these things if something is required if something is required then I thought you know if it's a requirement in the Bible for me to be a Christian walk right down supposed to get baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ now we say that's a requirement right well you know we go and do that right she's required or huh it's required that we follow in the lineup of the word and we we walk into to that alright but see then do we just say well okay oh I have it anyway no no it's not automatically now come on see I'm quoting brother Branham he said don't worry about it he said you get born again he said then these things will be automatically added right but he didn't say they're automatically added because you're you you get borned again you get the new birth then you depend upon God to bring these things into reality but if we don't know we have to have them if these virtues are required for us to be a virtuous Christian then you know you could go right over here and say did you know that we need these virtues that say what are you talking about because they don't know what that is in other words I'm trying to get you to look at something about what I was getting that Sunday these virtues are required you realize those virtues were people that had walked into the word until they made manifest those things right they made a manifest that was people that was Christians they were not happy to just go to church and be good they had a deeper desire a greater desire within their heart to be able to follow after God and that was the faith of the fathers huh see we'll get to those things when we come into it but look the point is now Malachi 4 says all right you turn the hearts of the father's to the children the children to the father's all right John turned them to the New Testament of Jesus Christ of the words pointed to him there he was from him came the faith of the fathers in the Apostles all right that was either way as far as now listen it wouldn't take an out see that's what we think either way you can still read Peter them but people didn't have in their understanding that those were requirements they just had in their understanding that we've got these things we've got this no no Peter said be in you and abound see the faith of the Father that's that seems to be the thing because you don't hear that priest anymore see we're so up high we're fender they're swept into that we're when the only thing well how did you get up there that's all I've ever asked how did you get up if it's required that we have these virtues if it's required that we have and you can't have say like you're born again here you can't have brotherly kindness in its full manifestation until you climb up that will we'll get to those time it's not to just look at it and say well okay that one hour we'll just work on that one no that won't work if these things are required then someone has to come forth into that and to walk into that word into the original faith that those disciples had brother Ron said they had these virtues he said they had the least little nod from God and they knew what God wanted them to do that's what we read so you can do is in paragraph 4 18 419 a statue of a perfect he said these are the things that God is expecting us to add these virtues and he said remember the one that we read on that go ahead and pull up number two and let's get to that one we'll just read a little bit this morning then we will go on but each age God has placed these things into the church and pattered it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities now not showing that everybody has them showing that everybody's require them are you reading with it's not saying they had it ever individuals born again don't have it it's a growth development all right so look now and he says the individuals has these possesses these qualities and this being when it's completed is the church now he's going to the whole pyramid the whole church that'll do what that'll when it's completed the Church of God going in the rapture and this being completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the rapture you realize then the rapture is is dependent upon someone obtaining to these qualities now that's what I'm saying that's what I'm trying to get over to you to say all right it's required it's required for somebody to reach that place all right because that's what's going to bring about the rapture he's not saying that every body down there there's plenty of people that will not have these virtues that will go in the rapture that's why they're dependent upon you and I they're dependent upon you and I they're dependent upon somebody somebody that will come forward with these things into manifestation well I think I would need to do just brother Dale he tries to make it so hard I just don't understand the lighting well I'm glad brother branham's one that said it he said when sister Shepherd had that dream and the different things and he told it he said she's worried whether she had the Holy Ghost or not at least she got concerned because brother Branham had preached it so hard that we just don't go to church and claim to be good but we're just to all the world Christians wherever though she at least had it as our heart I think that should be every one of us do I really have it lowered are these things in manifestation in my life or if I'm just a church owner see we know that those down through there that never attained to these things they're going to go in the rapture we yet seemingly here it looks like that's the only group that's going is the ones who possesses these things well there's people down through there that's died that don't possess these time already talking about what a change a rapture change those down to the lutheran 'm not required what will require but they're going in the rapture right he's not saying they're not going to go because they don't have these it's they're dependent upon you and i to bring it to a place to where the change can take place and the change the moment with weaker than i is to me what he's talking about they're not changing what he's saying but just make the point that the person with these things is the ones that's going to go in the change because we're all going in the rapture all born-again believers all born-again believers is gonna go in the rapture when the Lord comes right because that is the new birth now all born-again believers not just somebody believe in untruth not somebody confessing all who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth sealed in with God in that so that is the rapture and you're going in the rapture all right but there's a lot of people that don't have these virtues that's going to be there well it would sound like he's saying only those that have these virtues is gonna go into rapture no he's not saying that he said well how do you know what he said I know what he's saying go to know what he's already saying I know he's already taught us that the Holy Ghost inside the individuals what's gonna take us so then those people they're waiting on us to bring forth in the reality or somebody - why don't we claim we're the ones they he's waiting on somebody the whole Bible everything is dependent really if you read Hebrews 11 you realized the whole Old Testament all those great warriors of faith all those great Abraham's and David and the things that happen and then he summed it up by saying they without us cannot be made perfect see the Old Testament without the New Testament to bring it forth it's no good but the New Testament brings it forth into the right order all right but then listen then what about a lot of the years now I'm just hitting a little spot this morning and then we'll cover the other decision in us in let's look at number three and thank a little something about your prophet and what he was doing related with number three which is prayer about 275 then look what he says like I've tried to get this message over at the Tabernacle what message the statue of a perfect man because that's the faith of the fathers I've tried to get this over to the tabernacle we got him with each member of the tabernacle become this it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this is 33 years they have patience women still Bob door higher still the same but that's just how patients see just how patience wait see if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience see just wait wait all right what's he saying that each into each member of the tabernacle to become these things what these virtues because you see do you understand that the virtues and all of those things is the faith of the fathers they had the revelation of these things they taught the statue of a perfect man that's what I spent time over and over with it Peter telling you you add faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience Paul says adoption born into the family tutored then comes to the adoption and Paul carries it further than Peter Peter doesn't declare but he does say if they are in you and abound Paul says that when you come to that part he said in Romans 8 even to wit to understand the change of the body but they're both speaking the same thing that is the faith of the Father the faith of the father's is the revelation of the father's the revelation that they had so all right they stood at a position had these virtues knew the little nod from God listen Satan gradually dis take that away until you come down - what just go to church would be good well brother Dale I just don't understand him I don't I don't he just so deep I don't understand what's deep about what I just say it the disciples had these virtues and little each little nod from God all right so what would be the difference in them having and us having it we've got to have what they had right they had what we call the faith of the Father they had these virtues into manifestation they had the adoption and into the places were to do waiting for the change and see you and I've got to have that somebody has well I just don't see this it's necessary and we just go to church and be good that's exactly what the devil done and he slept the church to sleep or put her to sleep just by saying read your statue of a perfect man and brother instead see there they don't even teach this is required come on I send the virtue they don't even teach these things are required he said it's just go to church and be good well see I've never been happy with just going to church and being good the first thing I did never was too good to start with so I ain't worried about that then you started trying to be good you start trying to do this out of the other and that's well and good but you could be a buzzard with peacock feathers I didn't say that your prophet did right I want what they had is where I fought for that ever since I've been in the message a fault for the faith that they had to know that their faith was what we would have to rich have to recombination the word that our revelation of God and all would be right and you think about it think about what God has given you correct understanding of one God correct understanding a water baptism correct understanding of predestination correct understanding of no eternal hell correct understanding of all the Word of God thinking about what God has given you you don't go good things like that he has given us a marvelous understanding of his word over this past time that we've had he's given us then 50 years right 50 years after the going of the Prophet to study these things the word could be brought into manifestation how marvelous he is look what he's done for you and me look what he's made for you and I and he's given us the correct way and understand him he didn't just leave us to be in a religious Society you remember what he said he said Jesus appeared to the Jews did he appeared to the Samaritans - i'm cinda but he said he never brought to the Gentiles back tyre he went to the house of Cornelius all that was well and good there within all of those things but yet he still never went to the Gentiles did he reserve that to be in this day - where the son of man came into human flesh not brother branham being god or the son of man now no it was the Word of God in a man to show us the same thing that he showed the Jews and he showed us of right so he showed us that he's not left us blindly that we don't understand he's given us the word he's laid within our hands the very thing and see then if it's true I ask you the question if it's true that we must have the faith of the Father and you got to admit that's true or at least you were to have enough common sense to admit that's true I've put it down away you were to be sensible enough to realize something went wrong somewhere some problem exists you say well we don't see it like the Apostles seen it why not well they ain't no silent one the Apostles they nope here either I've said then I get into trouble doing those things that's all right you take the disciples and bring them down here they fight they faced the Sadducees and the Pharisees and a little road Ian's a few little group of trying to mingle around right there in the first part of the book of Acts but we face thousands of denominational ideas plus thousands of believers ideas and see carts all in that whole thing trying you and I to see if we will stay with a word said he's gonna prove this bride was gonna prove to Satan that she wouldn't be like Eve was she'd stay with the word you see that's where people are not happy for the word being revealed they want to see other things I get what I'm talking about swap places with us in the disciples they only faced a couple of little groups bring them down here that like I was saying nine minute ago you start preaching on something and the congregation's already figured out what you're going to say and your line up before you ever get the message finished it'd be wonderful I'd be more welcomed in a lot of the places in the organized religion if I just change certain little things you know not preaching the insular do it and let them know what you do it I'd be more welcome than I am among the believers of the message why because they automatically when is he gonna bring what is he gonna bring well forty some years that I've been with you tell me where I changed but you don't like that you think that's exalted show me where I've changed you name some of these and I'll show you where they changed right you name some other and I'll tell you where the time but what about it what about it Church we have been told what to do and how to do it we need to faith of the fathers okay now they had it and they walked in it now brother branham now we're asking him for the answer because he's the Prophet right brother branham how are we going to get the faith of the father's I don't mind doing that I don't mind when he comes like all Christ as a mystery of God revealed and says brother Branham what is the new birth well I love to quote that don't somebody ask him what is the new birth or a thought was in somebody's mind out in the congregation or something you know what yes it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right well brother then what is the new birth oh come on it's paid soon so Christ the mystery of God revealed the Prophet told us what it was well I just don't believe that I've never read that book I've had them to do that I don't know where it said I thought I've never read that book well boy that's a good thing innit I mean you gonna shut the whole world down cuz you ain't read a book right and you're gonna straighten that boy some people boy things he's straightened him out no he told him he'd never read that book now boy ain't that something that's about as dumb as you can get sorry but it's true huh see Church you I've asked the questions in other words my questions to you too I'm questioning maybe you don't understand my point getting that what seeing when the seals begin to open just ask God what's he talking about you know he don't mind you doing that you know he's never got mad at me and slapped me down because I asked him what this was or that one you might have answered yeah like I said about that wrote around him what is the new birth revelation Jesus Christ person to you what is the real true meaning of one God the prophet hamster what's the difference brother branham between the one god teaching of the oneness and the one god teaching of the you know in town doing whatever and he tell you it's the revelation of the same God that welcomed the shores of Galilee is the same God in your heart answer a question brother branham what is the truth what is the truth of marriage and divorce we'll go to girls almanac and read up on anything you're supposed to be asking the Prophet did one can't you believe what he said see it doesn't bother God for us to question him he enjoys us questioning don't you enjoy your children coming up in life and learning and do that and come to you and say daddy or mama this right here you know so you showed me one time how to ride a bicycle and why I can ride a by saying I like dog well are you gonna get mad at the child no you're gonna be joyous about it because you told him that no see all that's all I'm trying to get us to do if we ask them if we ask God for an answer he'll give us an answer but ask him with an open heart and not to try to build up our sales arena but just ask him see so ask God well how did I get these virtues if I'm required to have them how do I get them why don't you ask him like that Lord I'm required for having them so how to get them see then he puts in he sends a prophet to give us the answer and what was the answer the Prophet gave God how do we get these faith of the father's how do we become into the statue of a perfect man be a living moving instrument of Christianity a virtuous life and that how do we do it and he answers it but do we want that answer how do we get this faith of the fathers how do we get this statue of a perfect man how do we get this adoption because to me it's all preaching the same thing to us it's different ways that the disciples were describing how to come or to attain to where they were remember you can't teach nothing but but what's your what you have that's why they certain things I won't speak on you know why cuz don't understand it come on did the prophets say that then he wouldn't preach on hail for all of those here why because you didn't understand well see we try to figure it out now just read something leave it alone if you don't see it just read it leave it along just lay it down and you just say well Lord now all right you come on the scene somewhere all right it may be six months before you come back to that same thought or topic or reading again but just keep waiting and then you'll come and answer you if we're his children so brother branham how do we attain to this faith of the father's this adoption this statue of a perfect man when we realize that those virtues are required and those virtues are saying the same thing is the adoption is required that we have this to come to the faith of the fathers how do we get the faith of the father's Lord well I just study myself into it we'll get into it it's not head knowledge it's not head knowledge it's holy ghost knowledge the disciple didn't have just head knowledge they had Holy Ghost knowledge scene I want what they had don't you well brother Dale all my life I've wondered how do we get this how we get do you believe God sent us a prophet do you believe God sent us a prophet well then are we going to take what the prophets say it like I said we say brother Branham what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he says it's revelations Jesus Christ personally you write well what about these virtues I heard about this statue of a perfect man we've read this and over and over and over enough to you do you order be able to read it we'll go ahead and we're number four and put it up brother Branham how do we get these things as he tells us well I think it ought to be now I don't care what you think you or not care what I think you ought to care what God thinks right look what he said now this message of Malachi 4 revelation 10 7 is gonna do two things one according to Malachi 4 you turn the hearts of the children to the father you know what he's talking about it won't be him coming down and turning us it's his message right now come on are you are you with me it's his message he come to do that someone had to turn us back to the original truth and that's what the prophet came for it's his message that turns us back it's not if he just walks out and flicks a coin and we turned back look what he says okay don't brother branham you telling me that the way that I get this part of Melek I for I read in Malachi 4 that the first part of that because I've got the answer we know the truth of it John the Baptist was a part of mela cautery and john the baptist's turned the people of the old testament the father's to the new testament message which was jesus christ right you know he never taught anything about this or that he never talked doctrines of one God and all the things he turned us to the original so you understand what it would be then to turn the hearts of the Old Testament Saints to the New Testament message he turned them right straight to Jesus Christ right so what would be the end time to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers it be the same Lord Jesus Christ right but it's in the way he's doing it all right so what does he do how do i how do I know this is right because the word says it and according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's now we know who's going to do it right we got that solid we don't need another prophet we don't know how to run around with some of these big things that's going we know where it's at it's the message of the hour it's the prophets message all right that settle okay now well brother Branham we don't see it in full manifestation we don't we know that what was to be was to be brought by Malachi 4 and we understand that you and your message in the relation would be Malachi 4 the truth and we were just talking see we're talking to brother Branham we're asking him questions why can't I ask him questions he's the one who taught it so what does he say he said all right its messenger of Malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things according to Malachi for you turn the hearts of the children to the father he's going to bring back the original faith that was in the early church right no you with me he's going to bring back the original Word uh-huh because that would be the restoring Park to bring back the original word that Satan ate away in the dark ages uh-huh he was to bring it to that all right now look say what we don't understand all about it okay he says now there's two things he's gonna do one he's gonna turn the hearts of the children to the father's we understand that has to be done for this requirement in the scriptures now how's it gonna be done how are we gonna be turned back we just got the message now listen what he says number two numbers don't do two things he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 but ours whether or not you believe that that's been done I don't I don't play I put it straight he'll reveal the mysteries of the seventh mm has that been revealed now according to brother Branham the mysteries are now history I got these when we get home later into the message I want to know one thing you gonna be able to argue with it was honestly don't say it I stood and faced these things across the land for 50 years there's only one thing you're gonna argue about you're gonna argue your mind right now I said Argan because you're saying the new name of Jesus is to be revealed in the thunders what is that name that's the only one you can go with it come on you get on some of these others come on we'll talk the only thing you can say is worth a new name what is it my brother branham would you explain what you're talking about and many of you knows that he told us what it is it's Jesus no it's got to be something well in all right now I will go with the quotes he says why I love the message but I run said maybe it'll be in the made known when we get there you just lost your case he said maybe it'll be made known when we get there so you can't say the thunders are not sounded as the thunders and you want to go through the message you want to get over in in the message and has this happen has that happened he says happen looking for something instead of looking at what we've got so that's what I hold on to that I ain't worried about it now listen the mission of the seven thunders reveling to which are the revelation contained in the seven seal it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father's huh so how do we get back to the faith of the fathers by the prophets that brought the message right he brought the message that's how you and I are to a time how are we going to be turned back to the faith of the fathers then why are people so scared of the messages related to the seals in those areas when the prophets done told you see they've got in the message now that see one group says the seals broke the other group says it ain't broke no the group says they don't know what's going on that's just the best way to say it we'll see we can ask brother Branham how they have they open he said yes but he said it'll never be made known to the public lean concerned with it was her the one they'd known to the bride all right now if we have to have these virtues to how the face of the fathers then we've already got the message to bring it to us it's his message would you listen to his message would that understand you see church that's why that the Word of God is true we are looking either back or looking forward we're failing to look at what's taking place they are things to take place in the forward right that we're not supposed to look for them here right but why can't we accept what's right here we look back thank god we've had the truth bro but the Bible has always been present tense anybody in the Bible that ever amounted anything how many times I made this statement it's built on the basis of a present tense God a reality of right now we were talking about it life's not then you know in the Bible study had a good time talking talking about where we're at and what's going on then you say brother Joe's got a thing in order to look at it it's just a natural way of showing something so you say they ain't nothing going on you know I'm not seeing this I'm not seeing that so we don't have it because of that you take a drop of water and analyze that drop of water and then that drop of water is all kind of wiggle tail and all kind of thing dirt and Trice and garbage is no you wouldn't even want to drink the water cuz it's got bugs in it and just a drop of water let's see you look at the drop of water and said I don't see nothing you don't see nothing because you got to magnify all of that to be able to find what it's talking about you say well I don't see nothing going on brother Dale so we must not have it that to me is the greatest thing that you can ever think of it's for God to try a group of people to see if they'll stay with the word when he seemingly himself just backs off seemingly from the time the prophet left to seen God has just backed off to allow of people to be tried to see if they're gonna stand with it and look what's happening he took some of them forty years before they bring in to break what you don't want you showed me a guy that left the message you show me one that's left the message now go back in his life you'll find he's got some problems way on back because he walks away from the message now he never was in the message not that simple is it true never was in the message if he leaves the message now I was got one mark we'll get to it this evening brother Brennan said I'll show you now we've heard this statement about how he'll say you know there that he makes this statement he says I'll show you where God put the gifts in the church he said I want you to show me one scripture where there was taken out you remember that he said they was put in the church and you show me where was taken out you're gonna be surprised when you get to those gifts when we're talking about the fivefold ministry being the gifts to the church but think on these things are these things required is it necessary that we have the faith of the Father not if we don't want it not if we don't want to be interchange not if we don't want to honor our Father to glorify God with the things of taking the word and standing on the word when everything else is falling away come on the Bible told us that it couldn't be any end until what there has to come a falling away first this is falling away now if Bible prediction the people falling away because you can't fall off a building till you get up on it is that sensible you can't fall off a building till you get up on the building so the people had to get up on the building before they can fall out they had to walk in the message do the best they could some for 30 40 years and all at once you see them start falling away they had to be so close so close to the truth I don't glory in that people are falling away from the message that's not my point my point is the fact that they're doing it and that's Bible the Bible says they'll do it so there must be a falling away first you senator denominations is falling away no they found their way 50 years ago get it right they fell away when they turned down the message and him trying to bring it and Gordon loved them for all of those years the dead raised the sick Hill and they're still walking away come on you think I'm hard to start what about when he had those ministers together to challenge him on you know what he called him people's nothing right and he said one of them said I want 300 types to take to all of my ministers they never come after one but you never heard that guy griping about it he just walked away people walked away from the message while the Prophet was here that's your organized religions and things falling away but now everybody's falling away churches everything's falling away one because the people has walked into the word they've walked into the opening of the word and they can't go any further you know what's going to happen you and I are gonna do the same thing if we're not genuine right cause this is the day of manifestation right you get a guy's name and put it up for him to run for president and before they type his name on the front page of the newspaper they don't already tell him where he's wrong and what he's been doing who keeps up with all this stuff I mean do they have people that don't do nothing with camera all day walk around you go follow from them I won't follow Bush I won't follow this one you know you understand one get that how do they know so quick I don't even know the guys name you know and as quick as his name is brother he's this that it's a day of manifestation the day of making known what we really are and what's going on but it's the day the bride is supposed to be made manifest to know who she is to see if she'll stay with the word what about God trying you what about God deliberately letting these things happen to try you to see if you'll stay with a word what about it and even got to the point because I knew I'd just come up to a certain spot with the Prophet said I've tried Lord to get this to the people he said I've tied 33 years 33 years he preached the statute of perfect man says where people said no he didn't preach me see you're looking for a title or a sermon you're not looking at the word I look back in 56 on on the inner veil when he's preaching a living moving instrumentality of Christianity God walking on two feet in the people he was trying to teach that to the to the systems back then and he come up to the Pentecostal trying to teach him and what did he say when he said for Pentecost fail he said that's where you're looking for this and said you're failing to see that the new birth was just the beginning and said you take it and shouting it out and running it over we got this we're in the latter rain he said nonsense he said the former rain ain't come yet that's that is that oh no word regional see see they thought all they had to do is go to church and as long as they spoke in tongues right some kind of gifts or something that there was a he said that just brains that that new birth this brings you into the body he was trying to teach them Pentecostals the stature of a perfect man that the new birth this puts you in the body let's say they had it down red and sealed up everything was ready to go we was waiting on the bus to pull up go we're here and they were shouting glory hallelujah and rejoicing about that and he said that's where Pentecost failed where did they fail they failed on a progressiveness to move on in God that is God through that prophet begin to bring deeper messages in deeper messages people begin to fall away he began to bring truth right and they begin to fall away until he wound up in the end of his ministry preaching to half a dozen and a trailer or something because that's always going to listen do you understand why you must have these virtues because God has required it but now he's told us how to get it you think that wasn't a rejoicing time to me and somewhere along about 1980-81 somewhere right in that I had asked him over and over Lord how do I get these virtues and all like that he said just read 327 Church age book there was the answer the opening of the seven seals the opening of the word is to convert a people from babies to adulthood do you understand that it's gonna be adults that going to change of the body it's gonna be adults that can stand here and take all of the things it's going to be a dogs not babies we got it laid in our hands but what are we gonna do come on musicians what are we going to we've got to say welcome to our sister we see somebody back there I just she was behind that post and I kept moving around I don't think with it she's the first time here we say to you welcome glad to have you with us he's been here before we're glad to have her with us so with us either way okay but it's glad to do that what is the faith of the fathers the revelation of Jesus Christ in his word and then we are supposed to be manifest what those early church was now all I've ever said to you is what I said wanna go take us and put us back down you know I see things kind of funny I guess maybe you know what people say I don't want to live under the law you know what it'd be easy to live under the law you just don't do that right you just don't know how many of you got up stole stuff this morning how many of you lied and cheated and done everything today we don't want it be easy to live by book of rules but see then it brings it into the Christian realm that doesn't make it hard for us to do those things if we let it be part of our life this let it be part of our life you could live a good life under the Old Testament because you wouldn't be guilty of this that is everything long as you ain't guilty ain't guilty but yet you wouldn't be living what you need to be you know you don't have to be good to be a Christian you just have to be a Christian that automatically makes you good that's no problem you know I mean I steal everything I'm gonna steal don't you I mean come on Mina is that honest and sincere we don't go do those things we live a decent life would that be perfect under the law cuz you wouldn't be breaking it so he could live good Andrei but that would not be the fulfillment of what God wanted God wanted the people that would come forth into manifestation and be the law made flesh cuz that's what he was no no no no no no he was grace you know honey you don't listen he was the fulfillment of all the Old Testament Scriptures and all of that spoke of grace he just couldn't make it manifest for that time that's damn how many it may be even a wedding of the bride United with we still see anybody have a need what about it we shall see the king well funny that works [Music] [Music] how did it finished he said ask and you shall receive and we too ask for this to be made manifest that you will move on the scene and you would take care of all things in Jesus
