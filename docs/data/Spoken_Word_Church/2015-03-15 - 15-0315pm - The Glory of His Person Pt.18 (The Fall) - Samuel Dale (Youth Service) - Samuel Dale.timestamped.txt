[34:13] you good to see you everybody in the
[34:15] house of the lord really enjoyed the
[34:17] singing things
[34:19] just
[34:19] remember now the fellowship meeting will
[34:21] be here saturday
[34:23] 3 30 so make sure and get all the plans
[34:26] ready and everything and brother
[34:28] matthew bray will be preaching for us
[34:30] for that and then some on the weekends
[34:32] so remember that and just pray that the
[34:34] lord would bless remember wade being
[34:36] coming home tuesday
[34:38] brett the lord would take care of him
[34:40] and give everybody a safe journey of
[34:41] course he's going to be starting out on
[34:43] a different time than we are so
[34:45] he'll be ahead of us before we think
[34:47] about praying for him so pray for him
[34:50] now see that's the best way
[34:52] but amen you'd like turn in your
[34:53] scriptures turn to revelations 1
[34:57] and genesis 2.
[35:00] you've got a large thing to cover so
[35:03] i've
[35:04] jerked it back and i want to talk about
[35:05] the fall but i want to try to do it in a
[35:08] a way
[35:10] to
[35:11] break it up i guess into
[35:13] two services
[35:14] anyway because i got too much to try to
[35:17] get into one
[35:18] all right
[35:19] so let's just pray lord jesus we thank
[35:21] you
[35:23] for your grace your love your
[35:24] understanding
[35:26] thank you for you
[35:27] thank you for the fellowship lord thank
[35:29] you for the singing
[35:30] and truly as we were talking about this
[35:32] morning you'd rather have the worship
[35:34] the praise
[35:36] and the honor of your children
[35:38] than even the angels of heaven to be
[35:40] singing around you which you really
[35:42] enjoy them but yet you enjoy your people
[35:45] more we pray that you would receive that
[35:48] from us this day is what little bit of a
[35:50] praise and honor we could give unto you
[35:53] and that lord then you could
[35:56] you be satisfied with it forgive our
[35:59] sins and guide us and keep us
[36:01] let your love be with each one in jesus
[36:03] name
[36:04] amen
[36:06] all right genesis
[36:08] i mean revelations 1
[36:10] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[36:12] with me and being turned i saw seven
[36:14] golden candle sticks and in the midst of
[36:17] the seven candlesticks one like unto the
[36:20] son of man
[36:21] glowed with a garment down to the foot
[36:23] and gerd about the paps
[36:25] with a golden girdle now we'll get back
[36:27] to that one day but i hope you're seeing
[36:30] that we're talking about
[36:32] lot now as we're beginning to pick up
[36:34] about the bride of christ
[36:37] and you'll see more
[36:39] then when we get into the sevenfold
[36:42] glory
[36:43] of his person in her
[36:45] being made manifest all right let's go
[36:47] to genesis 2
[36:49] and we'll start in
[36:52] verse well let's start in verse 20. i
[36:54] think i gave him 21.
[36:56] and adam gave names to all the cattle
[36:58] and to the foul of the iron to every
[36:59] beast of the field but for adam there
[37:01] was not found and helped meet for him
[37:04] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[37:06] fall upon adam and he slept and he took
[37:08] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[37:10] and stood thereof and the rib which the
[37:13] lord god had taken from man made he a
[37:15] woman and brought her unto the man and
[37:18] adam said this is now bone of my bones
[37:20] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[37:22] called woman because she was taken out
[37:25] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[37:27] father and his mother and shall cleave
[37:29] unto his wife and they shall be one
[37:32] flesh
[37:34] and they were both naked the man and his
[37:36] wife and were not ashamed you may be
[37:38] seated the lord had his blessing
[37:40] to the reading of the word
[37:43] and you know
[37:44] if i jump around a little bit this
[37:46] afternoon
[37:47] uh like i said i want to
[37:50] divide this now we know
[37:52] i want to talk about the fall
[37:55] but i want to try to bring it in a way
[37:58] that will help us to understand
[38:01] and uh
[38:03] in doing it see we we know the physical
[38:06] aspect of a lot of things that we talk
[38:08] about in the garden
[38:10] and i want you to
[38:13] uh be lined up for that as we take a lot
[38:16] of that in the next message
[38:18] but i want this message to kind of be a
[38:21] uh thought pattern i guess you'd call it
[38:24] for understanding
[38:26] uh you know what we're we're doing but
[38:29] uh
[38:30] i did look up you know on the questions
[38:33] and answers and anybody else still has
[38:35] any more questions we will be glad to
[38:37] cover those things
[38:39] you know
[38:40] in any way in time that we can
[38:42] but i did look up some things because it
[38:45] was brought into relation
[38:48] uh to the part of
[38:50] the christ that we were talking about or
[38:52] the
[38:53] our christ coming forth
[38:56] and there's a lot in it in the spoken
[38:58] word is the original seed
[39:01] that talks about the christ in the way
[39:04] it should have been as a matter of fact
[39:05] we read this quote
[39:06] back
[39:09] before in the message
[39:11] but look what he says about it talking
[39:13] about
[39:14] uh this
[39:16] of adam and eve and the coming forth
[39:19] remember we were talking and i want to
[39:21] get this out of the way where can move
[39:23] on
[39:24] that
[39:24] how that
[39:26] if there had not been a fall
[39:29] then we would have come into being
[39:31] all right it would only bend the
[39:34] children of god to come into being but
[39:36] it would have been coming into being in
[39:38] the correct order but it was not done
[39:41] that away because
[39:42] now
[39:43] i want you to think about it because in
[39:45] genesis 1 26
[39:48] and 27
[39:49] you know covering that person
[39:52] that person was told on over another
[39:56] scripture to multiply and replenish the
[39:59] earth
[40:00] all right and
[40:02] i believe there would have been a
[40:04] spiritual multiplication
[40:06] of mankind
[40:08] had there not been a fall we would have
[40:10] come forth i believe that i we were
[40:12] predestinated
[40:14] and and would have been and they would
[40:16] have been a uh a whole lot better
[40:18] situation
[40:20] but yet it was not in god's
[40:22] plan to be that away
[40:25] but that's what i want you to look at
[40:26] and then relate it to the point listen
[40:29] to what brother branham says and go
[40:30] ahead and put that one up i think i gave
[40:32] it to him to put up first paragraph 147
[40:36] and 161 of the
[40:38] spoken word is the original seed
[40:41] he said he is correctly the son that ad
[40:44] the from the he is correctly the son
[40:46] from the first adam
[40:48] was the son that was promised to adam
[40:51] continue on the human race and eve
[40:54] hybrid it to the to the serpent and
[40:56] brought forth a generation of bastard
[40:58] children
[40:59] born to death without alive that's
[41:01] pretty rough about eyesight
[41:03] and jesus came and was that seed he
[41:06] proved it everything that adam lost
[41:08] jesus was
[41:10] see he he's the correct eve would have
[41:12] finally brought
[41:14] that child forth
[41:16] but she hybrid brought the serpent in
[41:19] listening for wisdom
[41:21] understanding and knowledge
[41:23] all right now watch those things in a
[41:24] minute then he gets over to paragraph
[41:26] 161 he says
[41:28] all of god's sons must be the same yes
[41:30] sir to be born of the word and spirit
[41:33] brings us back to the spoken word again
[41:35] like in john 3 see to
[41:38] be born of the water and spirit what
[41:40] does it do
[41:42] then it brings you right back again unto
[41:44] the place where you should have been at
[41:46] the beginning
[41:47] see that's the reason of christ's death
[41:50] bring us back
[41:51] right back again to two were sons of god
[41:55] if eve would have brought forth that
[41:57] child
[41:58] she would have finally done it
[42:01] did not god tell her
[42:03] multiply and replenish the earth so it
[42:06] would have happened
[42:07] had it not been that the fall came into
[42:09] being but the fall didn't change
[42:11] anything
[42:12] that was the main point i was wanting
[42:14] you to see and i always have wanted you
[42:16] to see
[42:17] that the fall didn't change didn't you
[42:20] know we think the fall was a horrible
[42:22] thing it was
[42:24] but it helped god display his attributes
[42:27] all right and in doing that then it
[42:30] wasn't so bad
[42:32] and that's the reason i want to kind of
[42:34] divide up the message this afternoon
[42:36] in in trying to
[42:39] get a little understanding
[42:41] about this person we talk about
[42:45] of you know
[42:46] eve and the fall and what took place
[42:50] and we won't go into the natural
[42:53] things we're going to stick with the
[42:55] spiritual because
[42:57] see before eve could have had any
[43:00] natural act
[43:02] before any woman can have any natural
[43:04] act with a man she must first accept him
[43:06] right here
[43:09] in her brain
[43:11] in her being
[43:13] that part of her that thinking
[43:16] that
[43:17] end that we call the spirit realm
[43:20] that has to work before it can happen in
[43:22] any form of natural so let's cover that
[43:25] spiritual part
[43:27] to think about it in a way
[43:29] that maybe you had never
[43:31] uh put it
[43:33] as to doing because like i said most
[43:35] preachers they just jump over to what
[43:36] happened
[43:38] you know well now remember
[43:41] drinking gambling smoking running around
[43:43] is not sin
[43:46] am i correct
[43:47] what is those things
[43:49] attributes of unbelief
[43:52] unbelief is the sin
[43:55] what was displayed is not the that much
[43:58] it's a
[43:59] attribute of the sin
[44:02] all right see before eve then could do
[44:06] anything naturally
[44:08] she accepted satan's lie and become
[44:12] perverted in the realm part of her in
[44:14] the spiritual part
[44:17] then the physical could take place so as
[44:19] we go on into that maybe the next
[44:22] message we'll
[44:24] we'll cover some of the natural to get
[44:25] back and and understand but i want your
[44:28] mind to stay with me
[44:30] in this part of the message to
[44:33] to understand
[44:36] that
[44:37] uh i don't look at eve as such a
[44:39] horrible
[44:41] person as a lot of people tries to make
[44:44] her
[44:45] and you know and i know see i've read
[44:47] the message
[44:49] i'm not blind to the points that brother
[44:51] branham would say
[44:52] she was made that way
[44:55] but now what's he talking about
[44:59] you know
[45:01] i mean that's as honest as i can say
[45:03] what's he talking about
[45:06] if she was made wrong
[45:10] how can god judge her for being wrong
[45:16] well she would just made that away
[45:18] all right you explain that now
[45:23] how was she made
[45:26] was she made a horrible situation
[45:28] remember
[45:32] god created both male and female
[45:36] now how was that condition what was it
[45:41] what was it in the garden that has been
[45:44] so
[45:44] outlandishly preached about women until
[45:47] they're just dog meat
[45:50] you know
[45:51] they're just no hopes whatsoever for
[45:53] them you know
[45:55] because there's a whole situation
[45:57] and then you turn around and take that
[45:58] same woman and bring christ
[46:02] from the woman
[46:06] you see what i'm saying we just we run
[46:08] our ideas and we don't think about
[46:11] the
[46:12] you know the the problem we don't think
[46:13] about the situation
[46:16] we just
[46:17] uh our thoughts well she was made wrong
[46:20] i was even looking at one there a moment
[46:21] ago because i happened to think of it
[46:23] that brother branham said satan was her
[46:25] designer
[46:27] now what do you mean brother branham
[46:32] you know
[46:35] brother branham said she was made wrong
[46:38] what do you mean brother branham
[46:43] all right
[46:45] said satan was her designer what do you
[46:47] mean
[46:50] because without an answer to what you
[46:51] mean
[46:54] you're making him say something that's a
[46:56] horrible situation
[46:59] i would consider a little bit the
[47:01] thoughts
[47:03] that maybe i might lay down some of my
[47:06] you know
[47:07] 40 years i've studied this out and i
[47:09] found out she ain't nothing but dog meat
[47:13] well you know your mama was a dog meat
[47:16] then
[47:20] oh
[47:21] but let's leave mama out of it yeah
[47:24] that's the way you want to be you know
[47:27] well
[47:28] but see
[47:30] we get into a lot of situations and we
[47:33] we think we've got it all figured out
[47:37] but does it pan out with the bible
[47:41] all right
[47:43] you say well are you saying brother
[47:44] brown was wrong no i'm saying he's right
[47:47] when he made statements
[47:50] but i'm saying he knows what he's
[47:51] talking about
[47:54] when he said he satan was her designer
[47:57] was he standing up there with god and i
[47:59] said okay now god what i want you to do
[48:01] now i know you don't mate adam but said
[48:02] what i want you to do now is you make
[48:04] her over this way and you shape her over
[48:06] this way and you do her over that away
[48:10] i i don't think so
[48:14] did he give
[48:16] god a set of blueprints you know
[48:19] now make her this away
[48:23] i don't think so
[48:29] and if you're saying brother branham
[48:31] said it on the basis he designed her
[48:33] wrong
[48:34] be careful how you say it
[48:38] that he said it
[48:40] because he said i believe he knew what
[48:41] he's talking about don't you
[48:45] all right
[48:46] well then did he design her there or is
[48:48] brother branham talking about
[48:50] that he's her designer now
[48:56] or has been her designer since the fall
[48:59] is he talking about the fall or
[49:01] something that he helped god design
[49:08] oh now folks
[49:11] let's get down to sensible thinking
[49:16] you know the facts of the matter of what
[49:17] we're making things
[49:21] see he is her designer
[49:24] but go read how the prophet talks about
[49:26] how he
[49:27] that satan is her designer he said with
[49:30] beauty
[49:33] now is anything wrong with being pretty
[49:36] anything wrong with beauty
[49:39] i believe and i'll quote him he said eve
[49:41] was the most beautiful woman in the
[49:43] world
[49:46] you know what got me listening to him
[49:48] one day because we always wondered
[49:49] herself what she looked like and he
[49:51] describes her and he says standing there
[49:53] now if i get this wrong you correct me
[49:55] but i believe he said standing there
[49:56] with that
[49:58] blue eyes and blonde hair
[50:02] i'm i'm you know i'm pretty sure i know
[50:04] he's talking about the eyes and i know
[50:06] he's talking about
[50:07] the blonde hair and the things
[50:12] is there anything wrong with the way she
[50:14] was made
[50:17] when she was in adam
[50:22] you know that while eve was in adam she
[50:24] had no ability to make any choice
[50:27] you know what she couldn't do wrong
[50:29] while she was an atom
[50:31] it wasn't a choice
[50:35] right
[50:36] there was no way to do wrong while she
[50:38] was in adam it's when she's removed that
[50:40] the situation begin
[50:43] but let's don't make it something that's
[50:46] reno said we'll try to divide this up a
[50:47] little bit let's don't make it
[50:50] something that makes the
[50:53] the woman the horrible looking
[50:56] part
[50:58] because you better remember and i've got
[51:01] it in here we'll get to at a while you
[51:02] know the bible says and adam all died
[51:04] doesn't say an eve
[51:08] now adam had a right
[51:11] to have rejected
[51:14] eve
[51:18] and this wouldn't have happened
[51:22] so when adam all die
[51:27] he's the one that sold the human race it
[51:29] would have been a matter of just
[51:30] destroying her
[51:34] but we know he loved her he done all of
[51:36] that you can
[51:38] in a way use it to type a little bit of
[51:40] christ in the church but don't type too
[51:43] far because remember
[51:45] he was taking a bad product
[51:47] back
[51:48] and god commands us not to do that so
[51:51] that's
[51:51] you be careful how you use things
[51:55] but i want your mind to just stay in a
[51:57] simple matter with me this afternoon and
[51:59] i didn't bring a lot of quotes i i just
[52:02] wanted to to use this part
[52:07] you know
[52:09] that
[52:10] eve was made beautiful
[52:14] she was made perfect
[52:20] but even the flesh of adam was not made
[52:22] eternal
[52:24] but how else can you describe it it was
[52:26] made perfect
[52:28] i think that was a beautiful little
[52:30] couple that was standing in the garden
[52:33] and i think god looked down upon them
[52:35] and says
[52:37] that's what i want to be in my church
[52:39] too
[52:41] i call i believe adam and eve was
[52:43] the best type of christ in the church
[52:45] could ever be
[52:47] you know
[52:48] because they were created perfect they
[52:50] were made right everything was going
[52:52] great
[52:57] but then we know
[52:59] to try to get this into the thought that
[53:03] you'd say well why didn't god leave it
[53:05] that way
[53:08] well he had attributes he wanted to
[53:10] display
[53:11] so he couldn't leave it in a situation
[53:13] of even adam in the garden
[53:17] all right now i've told you what i
[53:19] believe and told you some things this
[53:21] morning that i've always tried to teach
[53:22] and believe it that way
[53:26] all right
[53:27] i believe adam was
[53:29] made adam
[53:31] body spirit and soul because it takes
[53:34] that to make a human being
[53:36] all right
[53:38] then god breathed into the nostrils of
[53:40] adam
[53:42] and gave him eternal life
[53:47] as i try to explain that point because
[53:49] it's always been to me
[53:51] that if you just say well god created a
[53:54] body and a spirit and then he just put
[53:57] his life in there of eternal life then
[53:59] that's not adam
[54:04] you got to get the identity the person
[54:07] the doings of adam into the world
[54:10] all right
[54:11] now to me so would you have to do with
[54:13] eve
[54:15] and like i said i don't mind telling you
[54:17] because i don't have any problems that
[54:18] way you can say well that's your that's
[54:20] just your belief well okay you got them
[54:22] too so we'll sit down and talk about
[54:24] them
[54:28] but see i believe eve was my body
[54:31] coming from adam
[54:34] spirit coming from
[54:36] the feminist part
[54:38] that was in adam that we'll get to in a
[54:40] minute
[54:42] and soul as eve
[54:46] and then god gave her eternal life
[54:49] and would start the church his brother
[54:53] henry greene used to say quoting
[54:54] rhetoric i reckon i never did look it up
[54:57] but said that god started his church the
[55:00] way he wanted it and he wanted it the
[55:01] way he started it it's a good thought
[55:04] because what happened in the garden
[55:06] would have to be the type of christ in
[55:08] the church
[55:10] whatever finishes this
[55:12] situation would have to be the exact
[55:14] example of what started
[55:16] you can't start with this and wind up
[55:18] with that so then you've got to start
[55:20] perfect
[55:23] in your creation
[55:24] so what went wrong in the creation of
[55:27] eve
[55:29] it was not fleshly
[55:31] things because fleshly things do not
[55:34] work
[55:37] by themselves
[55:40] the bible says the body without the
[55:42] spirit is what
[55:44] dead
[55:47] it's so much in the human being until no
[55:50] matter how much you are in your thinking
[55:52] and still running right but if you tap
[55:54] that spine and the different things or
[55:56] something that will cut off the channels
[56:00] then the body is totally useless
[56:04] right
[56:06] so without the spirit to motivate it
[56:10] now i'm going to say this and i'll say
[56:12] it a couple of times where you won't
[56:13] misunderstand me
[56:15] i am not just talking about when we talk
[56:17] about the feminist part taken from adam
[56:20] and put into eve
[56:23] i'm not talking about
[56:26] just the spirit
[56:28] part to come into being
[56:31] i'm talking about a multiple
[56:34] point or many ways of looking at eve and
[56:37] and trying to comprehend
[56:40] her and what she is
[56:42] but dealing with the spirit realm
[56:46] right
[56:48] all right
[56:50] that way we can hold it to a point that
[56:52] that
[56:54] you wouldn't be then saying well brother
[56:55] dale god made her all right and soul he
[56:57] made her all right body but he made a
[56:58] wrong spirit you're just as far off as
[57:01] you are anywhere else
[57:06] you don't make any part that god made of
[57:09] eve to be wrong
[57:12] make it to be a beautiful creation
[57:17] one because that was what god wants in
[57:19] you and i
[57:20] amen
[57:25] and i will go ahead and say this because
[57:27] i know it's in people's minds to think
[57:30] and i know they did because brother
[57:31] branham when he said he said but you say
[57:34] brother branham said uh
[57:37] adam died he said before he died he had
[57:41] an atonement
[57:44] right
[57:45] now remember quick as he done something
[57:49] we were talking about in the bible study
[57:50] the other night i think it would
[57:52] remember as quick as adam done something
[57:54] right there's where he died
[58:00] right
[58:01] quick as he's done wrong right there's
[58:02] where she died
[58:04] now what's brother brown saying
[58:10] see the atonement was before the sin
[58:11] ever come
[58:14] no no no he didn't he didn't no he
[58:16] didn't do the animals until after the
[58:17] fall yeah but he stood as a lamb slain
[58:20] before the foundation of the world
[58:22] let's get in the bible
[58:25] before the foundation of the world
[58:26] there's already an atonement made
[58:28] because one second right
[58:32] in the presence of god in the line of
[58:34] sin you would have to annihilate the
[58:36] center
[58:38] so adam and eve would immediately been
[58:39] destroyed as quick as eve done wrong
[58:41] she'd have been destroyed the apple
[58:43] would have never got to adam
[58:45] she'd have been annihilated
[58:48] but the atonement was already made
[58:50] because god knew what he's going to do
[58:54] he knew he was going to allow it to come
[58:56] into being
[58:58] to be that
[59:00] right
[59:01] because he's going to display his
[59:02] attributes
[59:05] all right
[59:06] he had to make man
[59:09] which man and woman you know
[59:12] on the basis of what we talk about as
[59:14] freemore agency
[59:18] which is a right to choose
[59:20] all right
[59:23] making you where you can choose
[59:27] he made adam and eve both where they
[59:29] could choose
[59:31] we say well now adam couldn't do it well
[59:33] he did
[59:36] be careful how you say things sometimes
[59:38] you you you you get caught
[59:42] you say well adam couldn't do wrong i
[59:44] got where brother around said that amen
[59:49] okay
[59:51] but then when he accepted eve he went
[59:52] wrong right
[59:55] just don't ever get to the point to
[59:57] think
[59:58] church that because you got the baptism
[1:00:01] of the holy ghost that you can't do
[1:00:03] wrong
[1:00:06] when you do that you're in a horrible
[1:00:08] situation satan is more than your
[1:00:10] designer he doesn't got your brain
[1:00:17] but think about it
[1:00:19] god did not make us wrong
[1:00:22] because he could not do that and be
[1:00:24] judged
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:30] but if he'd make us right
[1:00:32] knowing that we would do wrong
[1:00:37] then he can now give us a choice and
[1:00:39] it's left up to you and i
[1:00:42] but don't blame adam and eve for your
[1:00:44] problem today
[1:00:48] right
[1:00:50] don't blame adam and eve for the wrong
[1:00:52] that
[1:00:53] well
[1:00:54] i just can't help being this way adam
[1:00:56] and eve sold me out
[1:00:59] they never sold you out you sold
[1:01:00] yourself out when you made a choice
[1:01:03] you had a choice
[1:01:06] you're a free mortal agent
[1:01:08] you kids you got a choice you're free
[1:01:10] more relations
[1:01:12] you can choose to do right or wrong
[1:01:15] and the choices you make early in life
[1:01:17] are valuable
[1:01:19] to a lot of things
[1:01:20] if a lot of us had changed our choices
[1:01:22] in early life we wouldn't have been so
[1:01:24] messed up in a later life
[1:01:26] right
[1:01:29] all right
[1:01:31] all right
[1:01:34] before we get into and i wrote it like
[1:01:36] this before we get too much into the
[1:01:38] thought
[1:01:39] of
[1:01:40] what
[1:01:41] took place
[1:01:43] in the garden
[1:01:45] in the acts and the things
[1:01:48] you know
[1:01:50] let's remember that those are attributes
[1:01:55] to be displayed
[1:01:57] so let's get down to see what the bottom
[1:01:59] line of it is
[1:02:03] as i said brother brown said satan was
[1:02:05] her designer
[1:02:08] but we know that he never told god how
[1:02:10] to make her
[1:02:15] he designed her after she got here
[1:02:20] her beauty and her doings
[1:02:24] and started using that
[1:02:27] right
[1:02:28] if you make it to the point that he made
[1:02:30] it wrong body spirit or soul either one
[1:02:33] then god cannot judge you for being
[1:02:35] wrong
[1:02:41] see we want to put all the blame
[1:02:43] back on
[1:02:44] eve
[1:02:46] and adam first corinthians 15 22 and
[1:02:49] adam all die
[1:02:52] he sold the human race
[1:02:55] into sin
[1:02:59] he knew what he was doing
[1:03:00] that's when the bible said that adam was
[1:03:02] not deceived
[1:03:04] he knew exactly what was taking place
[1:03:07] sure he loved eve and that that was the
[1:03:10] point and i'm glad he did
[1:03:13] because it might have ended all up with
[1:03:15] adam and we wouldn't have got here
[1:03:18] but see let's don't try to put any blame
[1:03:20] upon adam and eve
[1:03:22] let's look at the thing ourselves
[1:03:26] because the bible says that
[1:03:28] he was speaking about eve and he said
[1:03:31] lest satan tempt you as he did eve
[1:03:34] through his septility
[1:03:44] see if he told you you can't do wrong
[1:03:49] he's got you deceived
[1:03:53] all right
[1:03:55] let's look at it then in the part of the
[1:03:58] fall as we talk about it
[1:04:02] that in the garden
[1:04:05] in the beginning god made everything
[1:04:07] perfect
[1:04:09] right
[1:04:14] and then satan
[1:04:16] saw one ability
[1:04:21] that he could do and use
[1:04:27] they said then it's not the natural
[1:04:29] thing that we need to look at
[1:04:31] because that was not what took place
[1:04:33] first
[1:04:34] satan never
[1:04:36] uh
[1:04:37] just overpowered eve
[1:04:41] there's really no telling how long that
[1:04:43] took place
[1:04:45] because there was no records and times
[1:04:47] and things
[1:04:49] you know
[1:04:51] and you know i've always thought about
[1:04:53] it i've thought about
[1:04:55] uh
[1:04:56] if my wife kept hanging around an animal
[1:04:58] which we know the
[1:05:00] the beast and what it was it looked like
[1:05:01] a human
[1:05:02] then i i'd want to know why she wanted
[1:05:04] to hang around
[1:05:05] the animal all the time
[1:05:07] but you know evidently god took that
[1:05:09] away from adam's mind
[1:05:13] you ever thought that a way
[1:05:19] god took that away in other words he
[1:05:21] kind of blindsided him with it some way
[1:05:23] or whatever the words you want to use
[1:05:27] because adam never questioned eve about
[1:05:30] what she was doing
[1:05:34] but she started hanging around this
[1:05:38] beast that we talk about
[1:05:40] the missing link between man and the
[1:05:42] monkey the upright creature
[1:05:47] and you know it could talk
[1:05:52] and you know that
[1:05:54] he began to tell eve what she was made
[1:05:56] for
[1:05:59] and you know what
[1:06:00] he told her the truth
[1:06:06] was not she made for reproduction
[1:06:10] was not they already told in the
[1:06:11] spiritual condition to multiply and
[1:06:13] replenish the earth
[1:06:21] but you understand what i'm getting at
[1:06:24] he saw one situation
[1:06:27] that he could deal with
[1:06:30] he couldn't go to her body and say her
[1:06:32] body was made wrong
[1:06:38] because it wasn't
[1:06:42] he could not go to the soul
[1:06:45] because
[1:06:46] the soul wasn't made wrong
[1:06:50] and it was correct
[1:06:54] so what did he begin to do
[1:06:58] he began to get her to reason
[1:07:01] to think
[1:07:04] now you can see then
[1:07:06] what my main point of
[1:07:08] the message will be
[1:07:11] that in the spiritual realm
[1:07:13] of eve
[1:07:16] he begin to
[1:07:18] deal with her
[1:07:19] right
[1:07:22] through her memory reason which didn't
[1:07:24] have any memory of what
[1:07:25] remember this got something started but
[1:07:27] it's still memory reason conscious
[1:07:30] affections and things
[1:07:33] and you know the woman was made
[1:07:37] different from the man
[1:07:42] you see it kind of get messed up
[1:07:44] nowadays and a lot of things but
[1:07:46] that's something we can't do anything
[1:07:47] about
[1:07:49] but she was made on a motherly instinct
[1:07:58] whereas the male is made up on the
[1:08:01] working the building doing you know
[1:08:03] homes whatever
[1:08:05] kind of you don't hear brother random
[1:08:07] talking about eve you know you as blue
[1:08:10] and you hear him talking about eve along
[1:08:13] the side of adam hugged up and walking
[1:08:15] down through the garden with no problems
[1:08:17] and thing but then you hear adam as tree
[1:08:20] move
[1:08:22] wind slow down you'll hear those
[1:08:24] statements in brother brown's message
[1:08:27] because he's signifying the man as the
[1:08:30] male
[1:08:31] dominance part
[1:08:34] the protective
[1:08:36] you know the leadership the guidance
[1:08:40] and for the woman to have the feminist
[1:08:42] part
[1:08:43] to where that she would be under
[1:08:44] subjection to that
[1:08:47] all right i made a statement the other
[1:08:49] day and it was brought back to my
[1:08:50] attention that i said you women be
[1:08:52] careful you've got to have a head
[1:08:56] well it doesn't matter if you're a
[1:08:57] sinner or a saint
[1:09:00] sisters you got to have a head
[1:09:03] you honor your head and god will honor
[1:09:05] you
[1:09:06] you dishonor your head god will dishonor
[1:09:09] you
[1:09:11] well if he made my husband a different
[1:09:13] kind of a guy i might honor him some
[1:09:15] that was not the way that it says it
[1:09:20] you know
[1:09:21] it doesn't actually come out that way
[1:09:24] all right
[1:09:28] okay
[1:09:31] looking at the difference in the way
[1:09:32] adam and eve was made not to deal with
[1:09:35] the physical
[1:09:38] because you tell me there's anything
[1:09:39] wrong with the physical part
[1:09:41] now come on i mean
[1:09:43] if you can find something wrong with the
[1:09:45] physical part
[1:09:47] then god can't condemn you for that
[1:09:53] right
[1:09:54] so we can't be by dealing with soul and
[1:09:57] body
[1:09:59] we have to be dealing with this part
[1:10:01] that the brother adam would call the
[1:10:02] spiritual realm
[1:10:05] and he'd say that the feminist part
[1:10:09] of adam
[1:10:12] now
[1:10:14] today we got a lot of them that
[1:10:16] we call it getting in contact with their
[1:10:19] wrong side and you see them you know
[1:10:25] little feminist acting guys you know
[1:10:30] uh we say they got the wrong spirit
[1:10:33] then we say well the woman you know
[1:10:35] she's
[1:10:36] robust and go and do it and said
[1:10:39] she got the wrong spirit she's got the
[1:10:41] man's spirit
[1:10:43] well
[1:10:44] they can be some things medically maybe
[1:10:47] that deals with some of that but i don't
[1:10:49] deal with it too much i deal with it on
[1:10:52] on the basis of thinking about you and i
[1:10:56] we have a choice
[1:11:00] so then think about
[1:11:04] that there is adam standing there
[1:11:08] with this male and female parts but not
[1:11:12] in his body he doesn't have two sets of
[1:11:16] parts
[1:11:18] okay
[1:11:21] get rid of that one all right
[1:11:24] and you see if you get rid of that one
[1:11:28] you're not going to be so strong on the
[1:11:30] next one that i try to bring out all
[1:11:32] right
[1:11:33] so get rid of that part
[1:11:35] when he took a
[1:11:37] a rib from adam
[1:11:39] it wasn't a female rib that just
[1:11:41] happened to get stuck in there some way
[1:11:43] in creation
[1:11:45] right right
[1:11:47] it's examples or stories are telling
[1:11:51] what you're doing
[1:11:53] so he took part of adam's body and from
[1:11:55] that body
[1:11:58] and my wife are not the same dna
[1:12:01] but adam and eve would have been the
[1:12:03] same dna right
[1:12:05] because it would have been the whole it
[1:12:06] would have been the one person
[1:12:08] all right
[1:12:10] but do away with that feminist part of
[1:12:12] what you're trying to think about
[1:12:14] but don't think that adam one day
[1:12:18] you know i know i'm not tough but
[1:12:19] something
[1:12:20] motivating me then the next day he's oh
[1:12:22] yeah i feel it i got a little bit a
[1:12:24] little bit silly today
[1:12:29] okay
[1:12:31] just gotta get rid of all that
[1:12:34] because that's what falls in your mind
[1:12:36] what you think about
[1:12:40] think about what happens in your
[1:12:43] reasoning
[1:12:44] your memory
[1:12:46] your consciences and your affections and
[1:12:48] things
[1:12:51] a man in his memory reason and things is
[1:12:55] not supposed to think feminist right
[1:12:59] all right
[1:13:00] he's supposed to think of masculine
[1:13:04] now the woman in her feminists is not
[1:13:06] supposed to
[1:13:08] think of masculine
[1:13:11] points and things
[1:13:13] he's supposed to be motivated by
[1:13:14] different things
[1:13:17] the female is made with the
[1:13:19] motherly instinct
[1:13:22] you see it in the animals you see it and
[1:13:24] all of the things that that motherly
[1:13:27] instinct is dwelling in the female
[1:13:30] sector
[1:13:33] whereas the male is
[1:13:35] he's just out and gone
[1:13:37] you know
[1:13:41] it might give you a little better idea
[1:13:42] of what happened in the garden
[1:13:46] it might make you think a little bit
[1:13:48] about what took place there and what
[1:13:50] takes place now
[1:13:52] right
[1:13:54] now i said a woman she she can't go uh
[1:13:57] with an ill
[1:13:58] uh a wrong act with a man until she
[1:14:01] thinks things over
[1:14:03] and we're not talking about rapes we're
[1:14:05] not talking about slap down knockout
[1:14:07] drunks something
[1:14:09] we're talking about sensible
[1:14:12] life and doings
[1:14:16] you know
[1:14:18] but there's just something different
[1:14:20] between a man and a woman
[1:14:23] my wife she wants everything
[1:14:26] fixed and done and you know
[1:14:30] now i don't want it to slunk around but
[1:14:33] i don't spend that much dwelling with it
[1:14:38] and now i do get up my clothes out of
[1:14:41] the bathroom
[1:14:42] and carry them to the to the clothes
[1:14:44] dryer i ain't that bad to leave
[1:14:46] everything just laying around saying
[1:14:48] that's your job
[1:14:51] remember brother dale he doesn't get
[1:14:53] along with a lot of people about his
[1:14:55] stance stance or what you call it my
[1:14:57] position
[1:14:58] you know because i'm like this brothers
[1:15:02] if you're be real if you're real bad
[1:15:05] about
[1:15:06] well you ain't got my suffer cooked
[1:15:11] and she's been at work all day long
[1:15:15] remember she's doing your job
[1:15:19] oh
[1:15:23] brother dale talks rough don't he
[1:15:28] you know
[1:15:29] well you're the woman you're supposed to
[1:15:30] be the cooking
[1:15:32] well you're the man you're supposed to
[1:15:33] be making a living
[1:15:36] well i do the best i can get you two
[1:15:37] jobs
[1:15:40] that's right
[1:15:42] and i know today it's basically you
[1:15:44] can't exist on one income i know that
[1:15:47] but
[1:15:48] i just don't make it right you know
[1:15:51] that just makes it in a situation we're
[1:15:53] living in but i'm just straight and
[1:15:55] honest and blunt too my wife never
[1:15:57] worked
[1:15:59] she worked about probably three months
[1:16:00] out of her married life and that was
[1:16:02] right after we got married and wade came
[1:16:04] along and and she got laid off because
[1:16:07] they'd cut back it to work and that
[1:16:09] tickled me to death and you know whis
[1:16:11] crowns for a living sure we didn't have
[1:16:14] too much money when if i was making 42
[1:16:16] dollars a week when we got married so
[1:16:18] you can figure we wouldn't make it too
[1:16:19] good
[1:16:21] but i still didn't want her to work
[1:16:28] i wanted her to stay at home
[1:16:30] and i told her the day that they called
[1:16:32] her back which she was the first one
[1:16:34] they called back when they put the
[1:16:36] shift back on you know
[1:16:38] because she was a good worker and they
[1:16:40] liked her but i said you you know you
[1:16:42] make the choice you stay at home with
[1:16:44] the kids
[1:16:45] and and take care of that and i'll make
[1:16:47] a living or i'll stay at home with the
[1:16:49] kids and you make a living
[1:16:50] she knows i told her lately
[1:16:54] and you got to remember we might have
[1:16:55] been making 60 dollars a week by then
[1:16:58] but
[1:16:59] i still meant it
[1:17:01] because that's just the way i stand
[1:17:04] well brother dale you you're against me
[1:17:06] and my wife and i said that between what
[1:17:07] you and your wife's doing is your
[1:17:09] business
[1:17:10] that ain't my business
[1:17:12] i'm just talking like it's supposed to
[1:17:15] be all right
[1:17:19] so you wouldn't have a lot of problems
[1:17:20] if you didn't put out those situations
[1:17:22] but of all soap and blood you're right
[1:17:25] brothers and sisters right i've never
[1:17:27] tried to fool around deceiving i've said
[1:17:30] if i've married some of you me and i'd
[1:17:31] have three jobs
[1:17:35] i would i would never be in the house
[1:17:39] okay
[1:17:42] i get by of that mostly you can't talk
[1:17:44] that away
[1:17:46] but listen
[1:17:48] being serious now
[1:17:52] what's the difference to man to woman
[1:17:57] you go by what you're looking at or
[1:17:58] something
[1:18:00] i don't i watch people
[1:18:03] in their nature and their doings
[1:18:06] and things
[1:18:07] i try to read the inside more than the
[1:18:10] outside
[1:18:11] because the outside can be deceiving
[1:18:14] but that inside i watch that
[1:18:17] i see real true sisters that are real
[1:18:19] true sisters
[1:18:21] you know
[1:18:22] and i thank god for them
[1:18:24] i see men that are some good men you
[1:18:26] know very few but some
[1:18:29] and i thank god for them
[1:18:31] but then
[1:18:32] all of this other is a mess up thing
[1:18:34] that we're in life with
[1:18:36] but that ain't got nothing to do with
[1:18:37] you and i
[1:18:40] well brother dale it's just not
[1:18:41] according to the world today well
[1:18:44] now
[1:18:45] are you going to write revelations
[1:18:48] chapter 14 i mean chapter
[1:18:51] 24 what was that and brother randomly
[1:18:53] said because you could write chapter 23
[1:18:55] or something you know are you going to
[1:18:57] write up 24 or 25 and try to make it
[1:18:59] right because of the situations of life
[1:19:03] no no we're supposed to be the other way
[1:19:06] all right
[1:19:08] but think about it what realm do you
[1:19:10] deal in
[1:19:11] if you deal in
[1:19:13] things that go wrong
[1:19:17] i'm serious what realm do you deal in
[1:19:19] when you think about things going wrong
[1:19:21] when it's not the bodily part and it's
[1:19:23] not the soul part
[1:19:26] what realm are you dealing with
[1:19:30] when emotional
[1:19:31] life
[1:19:34] your memory your reason your conscience
[1:19:36] and a lot of other
[1:19:37] things that goes in there
[1:19:42] and see that's where satan then he knew
[1:19:44] what he could do
[1:19:45] he saw the one not weakness that god
[1:19:48] made because now come on
[1:19:51] you get the story right
[1:19:53] and and you don't have to worry about
[1:19:54] all of these fantasies you try to drum
[1:19:56] up
[1:19:58] remember eve never had no memory of
[1:20:00] something wrong
[1:20:06] right
[1:20:08] so don't deal like that
[1:20:11] he didn't see a weakness
[1:20:16] that god would make it to where there'd
[1:20:18] be some weakness
[1:20:20] that he could deal with
[1:20:23] satan just knew her makeup
[1:20:26] and her beings now quote the prophet
[1:20:28] he said satan had a knowledge of the
[1:20:31] principles of life
[1:20:34] now what is having the knowledge of the
[1:20:36] principles of life what life consists of
[1:20:39] you know
[1:20:41] all right
[1:20:42] so he knew he couldn't touch her body
[1:20:47] right
[1:20:49] come on i don't want to be blunt but i
[1:20:51] want to be playing
[1:20:53] the female
[1:20:55] the male dog don't get around to female
[1:20:58] until the right time right
[1:21:01] because he'll get whooped
[1:21:05] so you don't deal with those type of
[1:21:07] things get away from that get down to
[1:21:08] the point of what i'm trying to drive
[1:21:10] and you
[1:21:11] you'll see what
[1:21:13] life is about
[1:21:15] right
[1:21:17] so satan looked and he looked her over
[1:21:19] and he tried to do everything and
[1:21:21] he thought well there's got to be some
[1:21:22] way for me to get into the human race
[1:21:24] because that was his desire right
[1:21:30] so he begins to talk to her
[1:21:37] through the beast
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:42] he begins to talk to her
[1:21:44] and after a while he detects a
[1:21:47] open door that he can
[1:21:50] dwell in
[1:21:52] now hearers were to me
[1:21:55] that eve went wrong
[1:21:58] because the beasts begin to say
[1:22:01] you can do this
[1:22:02] you can do that
[1:22:05] getting into her conscience part of her
[1:22:10] she wound up being a good woman preacher
[1:22:13] and that's where your sister's messed up
[1:22:16] if you want to know of anything brother
[1:22:17] dale where it went wrong at that's where
[1:22:19] it went wrong
[1:22:24] i wasn't the one that said a woman is a
[1:22:26] thousand times easier to be deceived
[1:22:28] than the man i didn't write that
[1:22:31] i'm sorry
[1:22:37] but as he begins to talk to eve
[1:22:39] she begins to preach to him
[1:22:45] surely the beasts begin to tell her you
[1:22:47] know satan through that this is what you
[1:22:50] were made for
[1:22:53] you were made to be this well that's
[1:22:55] true
[1:22:57] show me one lie that the devil told eve
[1:23:03] not until it got over there where it
[1:23:04] said we shall not
[1:23:06] the only way you can go with it right
[1:23:10] the adding of the one word not is the
[1:23:12] only thing you're going to get with the
[1:23:13] devil because the other part of what
[1:23:14] he's telling her is exactly right
[1:23:19] that's why paul said be careful
[1:23:21] let satan through his septility
[1:23:24] deceive you as he did eve
[1:23:31] well there is he begin to talk to her
[1:23:36] things begin to develop not in the wrong
[1:23:38] things
[1:23:40] that's where you're going to go wrong
[1:23:41] with all you want to run it into some
[1:23:43] playboy magazine
[1:23:46] deal you're running into the wrong
[1:23:49] thoughts
[1:23:52] he could've never contacted eve that
[1:23:54] away
[1:23:58] neither does a woman run off with a man
[1:23:59] that way
[1:24:01] it's when she suckered into it or talked
[1:24:03] into it or brought into it
[1:24:09] what did brother run say
[1:24:11] not the old man with the overalls you
[1:24:13] got to watch around your wife
[1:24:17] while he illustrating like that he said
[1:24:18] that slick tongue
[1:24:20] guy
[1:24:23] right
[1:24:25] see that's what satan began to do
[1:24:27] through the beast
[1:24:28] is just talk to her
[1:24:31] and she began to preach back to him
[1:24:34] he said
[1:24:35] can you eat of these trees
[1:24:38] she said
[1:24:39] well i got you
[1:24:42] well we can eat of every one of them
[1:24:44] except one
[1:24:47] she got a good sermon no i wasn't the
[1:24:49] one that said it brother branham said
[1:24:51] eve was the first woman preacher now so
[1:24:53] you argue it all you want to
[1:24:58] she began to preach to him
[1:25:03] and she got good anointed with it
[1:25:07] right
[1:25:09] didn't happen in a five minute period
[1:25:13] could have been years and years of
[1:25:14] earthly time
[1:25:16] that this situation would go on daily
[1:25:18] daily daily of the discussions and
[1:25:21] things
[1:25:23] and satan telling her
[1:25:25] 99.9
[1:25:27] truth
[1:25:30] because she was made for that purpose of
[1:25:32] reproduction
[1:25:36] she was made for the purpose of being a
[1:25:38] mother
[1:25:42] all of those things
[1:25:44] contact
[1:25:46] the woman through her spiritual part of
[1:25:48] her
[1:25:52] now you tell me anything else that was
[1:25:54] took out of adam
[1:25:55] but you tell me don't take that out of
[1:25:57] that i'm wrong
[1:25:59] like i said we're not silly
[1:26:02] he wasn't silly over here one day and
[1:26:04] manly over here and he took one of them
[1:26:06] out he's born right now
[1:26:11] what are you talking about
[1:26:16] it's simply that
[1:26:18] the feminist part of adam
[1:26:22] that was to be placed into flesh
[1:26:25] to bring forth a beautiful woman
[1:26:29] that would be flesh of his flesh and
[1:26:31] bone of his bone
[1:26:32] and what would it be that's why we
[1:26:34] misquote the scripture
[1:26:38] we say he made him help mate that ain't
[1:26:41] even the bible
[1:26:46] it doesn't say help mate
[1:26:48] it says help meet
[1:26:50] m-e-e-t
[1:26:53] look up the difference in the word mate
[1:26:54] and meet two men can be mates two women
[1:26:57] be mates
[1:26:59] but meat mens of products are the same
[1:27:01] value are coming from that are being won
[1:27:04] with that
[1:27:08] had she taken her emotional situation
[1:27:11] home to adam
[1:27:14] and talked with him about things and i
[1:27:16] believe they did
[1:27:22] see because the devil according to
[1:27:24] brother branham just finally got to the
[1:27:25] point of saying hey look adam didn't
[1:27:27] tell you these things plain language
[1:27:29] paraphrase
[1:27:30] he didn't tell you these things
[1:27:32] she said well i figured it out myself
[1:27:36] now you women preachers fuss all you
[1:27:38] won't do at me about it
[1:27:43] some of you women intelligence wise my
[1:27:46] wife is if you checked our intelligence
[1:27:49] mine might be 40 and hurt 80 or 90 but
[1:27:52] and i don't say that wrong i say it
[1:27:54] right
[1:27:56] a lot of you women are
[1:27:58] smarter
[1:27:59] intellectual minded
[1:28:02] than your husband
[1:28:05] okay
[1:28:07] because we're in the day when the
[1:28:08] feminist thing has flourished upward to
[1:28:10] where that women have to have a job and
[1:28:13] have to do things and all
[1:28:20] but that still don't make you smarter
[1:28:22] right
[1:28:23] they still don't change that you're a
[1:28:25] thousand times
[1:28:26] easier to be deceived
[1:28:28] it's just got to be somebody that knows
[1:28:30] how to do it
[1:28:32] right
[1:28:36] i looked at some women that rose up in
[1:28:38] our community
[1:28:39] and the men that they wound up dating as
[1:28:42] we call it
[1:28:44] and i thought what is wrong with these
[1:28:45] women
[1:28:50] that old stinking
[1:28:51] chewing tobacco garbage can
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:58] dirty stinking
[1:29:02] and you see them they wouldn't even talk
[1:29:04] to a guy that was halfway decently clean
[1:29:07] why
[1:29:09] come on women i'm talking to you
[1:29:12] why
[1:29:14] because he knows how to handle his words
[1:29:20] he knows how to talk to you
[1:29:23] how many of you girls ever dated a guy
[1:29:24] and you walk up to and say hi and he
[1:29:26] said get away from me are you ugly
[1:29:27] looking slot
[1:29:31] i bet there was never another thought
[1:29:33] about dayton
[1:29:35] right
[1:29:41] but he starts dealing with you
[1:29:44] on how beautiful you are
[1:29:47] and how that you're just
[1:29:49] wonderful
[1:29:53] and you're just eating out of his hand
[1:29:57] heard the other day where there was a
[1:29:59] a 90 year old pig you'll remember the
[1:30:02] other story but a 90 year old woman matt
[1:30:04] was telling me about it that she got her
[1:30:06] a 40-something-year-old friend
[1:30:09] a guy you know
[1:30:11] and he's done built her out ever once
[1:30:13] you use that word and cheated her out of
[1:30:15] almost 500 000
[1:30:18] that she had in the bank and she's got
[1:30:20] 19 000 left because matthew knows the
[1:30:22] story because a lot of us in the state
[1:30:25] farm hookup you know
[1:30:31] peggy knows the story about the one we
[1:30:32] read in the paper the other day where
[1:30:34] this lady was 90 years old and his two
[1:30:35] this man father and son cheated her out
[1:30:38] and he has to pay back 3.4 million and
[1:30:42] the other guy has to pay back almost a
[1:30:43] half a million you know ain't gonna
[1:30:45] never get it but you know how that is
[1:30:47] they got to pay it back well that means
[1:30:48] it's cheated that poor woman out of
[1:30:50] probably what 10 million dollars
[1:30:52] or maybe even more
[1:30:57] then you tell me women can't be deceived
[1:31:02] you know
[1:31:03] not a lot of me entered that way too
[1:31:04] lost a lot but just get the point
[1:31:08] i said i wanted to break it up into a
[1:31:09] point of looking at something different
[1:31:11] from what we always look at it we just
[1:31:13] look at it well so we we're in the
[1:31:15] message we know what happened in the
[1:31:17] garden he didn't eat no apple
[1:31:20] we know all about it
[1:31:24] we're tied together with what paul said
[1:31:27] talking to who
[1:31:30] who would fault talking to
[1:31:33] christians
[1:31:34] the bible's not written centered he's
[1:31:36] talking to christians don't be like eve
[1:31:40] and be deceived through his septility
[1:31:45] and then you got the woman coming along
[1:31:46] and said god called me to preach
[1:31:54] okay
[1:31:57] think on these things
[1:32:01] as satan began through he through the
[1:32:03] beast to talk to eve
[1:32:05] he contacted her parts that
[1:32:08] was not something wrong feministly
[1:32:13] he contacted her inward being
[1:32:17] and he began to get her to reason about
[1:32:19] things
[1:32:20] to think about things
[1:32:23] to see new light
[1:32:24] am i talking about the way the prophet
[1:32:27] would say it
[1:32:29] she was searching for new wisdom new
[1:32:32] light
[1:32:39] i've never had any problems with
[1:32:41] letting my mind run on a
[1:32:44] scale to where that maybe she might have
[1:32:46] even walked back to e to adam and said
[1:32:48] adam
[1:32:50] you know
[1:32:51] i began to talk to this beast over here
[1:32:54] these things he's telling me that you
[1:32:56] ain't told me
[1:33:02] he said eve
[1:33:04] it's not time
[1:33:07] leave it alone
[1:33:10] he said well you don't know about that
[1:33:11] well neither you don't know it ain't
[1:33:12] right either so forget it
[1:33:15] all right
[1:33:17] the point is
[1:33:19] he found a way
[1:33:22] to approach eve
[1:33:25] to where
[1:33:27] that she would fall into his trap
[1:33:33] and willingly give herself
[1:33:36] later physically
[1:33:39] to that
[1:33:41] a woman give herself to an animal
[1:33:47] because that's what that was
[1:33:50] it was a beast
[1:33:55] young girls
[1:33:58] maybe we need to have some more time
[1:34:00] together we had a time one time that was
[1:34:02] going gonna take all the girls
[1:34:04] and my wife we went in together and sat
[1:34:06] down and we talked about life to the
[1:34:08] girls you know
[1:34:10] and we never did get to the boys and
[1:34:12] maybe that's where it started with the
[1:34:13] boys i guess
[1:34:15] but
[1:34:19] girls figure it out real quick in life
[1:34:25] right
[1:34:26] i got three up here today i don't know
[1:34:27] why you went up here
[1:34:29] on the front row someone talked to you
[1:34:33] watch him slick tongue
[1:34:35] lit around and what did he say what that
[1:34:36] little girl say
[1:34:38] something he said something about that
[1:34:40] boy she said
[1:34:42] but he smelled so good and what did say
[1:34:45] had pretty feet i believe that's right
[1:34:46] on my right had pretty feet and smells
[1:34:48] good
[1:34:49] he said i wouldn't care if he stunk like
[1:34:53] a
[1:34:54] some kind of horse or something and had
[1:34:56] feet like car boxes
[1:34:58] said if his heart was right
[1:35:02] remember girls
[1:35:03] the boy's trying to deceive you
[1:35:06] and what he's going to try to contact
[1:35:07] you with is what's in here
[1:35:10] amen
[1:35:11] connected down through your whole being
[1:35:15] to where that you're made different
[1:35:18] and very easy to be deceived
[1:35:22] you know
[1:35:24] like i say
[1:35:26] you ain't going to say hi to them boys
[1:35:27] they say get out where you ugly wood
[1:35:31] you just you don't leave them alone
[1:35:34] don't
[1:35:35] let people deceive you by their
[1:35:38] sweet tongue
[1:35:40] because that's what it always does okay
[1:35:43] so are you getting a point to what went
[1:35:45] wrong with eve
[1:35:47] that god never made her wrong
[1:35:52] satan just saw the one thing that he
[1:35:55] could work on and that was her emotions
[1:35:58] and as i said he got her started by
[1:36:00] getting her to preach to him
[1:36:05] oh you're so smart
[1:36:08] why i'm the right-hand man said you know
[1:36:12] you remember
[1:36:13] satan was the anointed child stood
[1:36:15] beside the lord
[1:36:16] he said i'm i know all about these
[1:36:18] things
[1:36:20] i said you're bringing things to me that
[1:36:22] i didn't even understand
[1:36:29] satan is a very deceiving thing
[1:36:35] but you see
[1:36:36] if you're getting the point eve didn't
[1:36:38] have no weakness
[1:36:40] we have weaknesses right
[1:36:42] we have weaknesses because of our
[1:36:44] inheritable traits and characteristics
[1:36:46] and doings but he never had a weakness
[1:36:49] that god made her weak
[1:36:51] to where that she could be no
[1:36:54] so if he could tackle the part if he
[1:36:56] could tackle this
[1:36:58] the one that was made correct
[1:37:02] don't you ever think ladies that he
[1:37:03] can't tackle you
[1:37:08] come on eve didn't have no wrong
[1:37:10] thoughts he didn't have no wrong
[1:37:12] reasonings and things to go wrong
[1:37:17] and he was able to deceive her
[1:37:21] right
[1:37:25] we're made with reasons
[1:37:27] that's our whole makeup
[1:37:29] what do you understand
[1:37:34] do you understand the weak the part that
[1:37:36] eve that he could get to
[1:37:43] then he could take her to the wrong
[1:37:45] things and body
[1:37:48] but he had to get that part first
[1:37:53] and deceiver
[1:37:59] might i bring it to a close with one
[1:38:01] thing of saying
[1:38:02] don't ever think just because you're
[1:38:04] born again that you can't be deceived
[1:38:10] i would ask you to remember
[1:38:12] that a lot of you claimed that you had
[1:38:14] the new birth before you heard of the
[1:38:15] message
[1:38:16] i'm not saying you didn't now i just
[1:38:18] said some of you
[1:38:20] you know
[1:38:21] and you as trinitarians
[1:38:24] and you with all kind of things with the
[1:38:26] cut hair and the pants and the makeups
[1:38:28] and the things and you still was just
[1:38:31] you thought it was right
[1:38:35] well evidently the devil already had you
[1:38:37] deceived
[1:38:41] because you sure fought when the truth
[1:38:42] is brought right
[1:38:46] and i remember my wife's reasoning to
[1:38:48] show you and i'm throwing off on her i'm
[1:38:50] telling the truth because she knows it
[1:38:52] happened
[1:38:53] and when we got to talking about the
[1:38:54] haircutting and the things you know it's
[1:38:56] wrong for a woman to cut her hair well
[1:38:58] you know what she said and violet did
[1:39:00] y'all remember violet how she used to
[1:39:01] roll her hair up and
[1:39:03] the things you know and fix it
[1:39:05] and made it up and it was kind of rolled
[1:39:06] up because most of the women you know
[1:39:08] fixed it up and brought it up
[1:39:10] and she said well look at violet her
[1:39:12] hair's shorter than mine
[1:39:15] the way it looked it was
[1:39:18] you know
[1:39:21] well i said honey that ain't the point
[1:39:24] the point is it don't make no difference
[1:39:26] and she's bald-headed
[1:39:30] right
[1:39:31] maybe not the words i used in but she's
[1:39:33] ball-headed and not cutting her her
[1:39:36] hair's as long as anybody's in the world
[1:39:39] listen it's not the length of the hour
[1:39:41] it's the fact of where it was being cut
[1:39:42] or not
[1:39:44] and we used to get into some pretty good
[1:39:45] discussions
[1:39:47] some people called it argument we called
[1:39:48] it discussions
[1:39:53] and you know what
[1:39:55] blame it on me
[1:39:58] one day i finally said honey just read
[1:40:00] this
[1:40:02] and uh
[1:40:04] she sat down and she read it and she
[1:40:06] said because her hair is her
[1:40:10] covering
[1:40:15] she said why didn't you ever tell me
[1:40:16] that
[1:40:19] i said we got mad enough before we got
[1:40:21] down to that part i forgot about it
[1:40:22] again
[1:40:26] but you know she never had no more
[1:40:28] trouble
[1:40:30] because she read it in the scripture
[1:40:33] that her hair is recovering
[1:40:36] and there never was another word about
[1:40:38] her hair
[1:40:39] it wasn't
[1:40:40] mentioned
[1:40:43] right
[1:40:46] but you see how easily satan can deceive
[1:40:49] us
[1:40:50] just don't ever think you can't be
[1:40:52] deceived yeah but i'm a born-again
[1:40:53] christian i can't be deceived you can't
[1:40:56] be deceived in long enough to be lost
[1:40:58] you can't you cannot be lost if you're a
[1:40:59] christian right we agree
[1:41:02] but remember through satan's septility
[1:41:05] you know that he you can argue this and
[1:41:07] a lot of people have argued it but
[1:41:09] you ain't going to argue with this boy
[1:41:10] about it brother branham said it was a
[1:41:12] bride that went down to narcia
[1:41:15] people would say no he didn't no it
[1:41:17] didn't well you better keep reading
[1:41:20] i can't believe it
[1:41:22] then others come up with a good one well
[1:41:24] they went down there and they and i
[1:41:26] there's a quote they went down there and
[1:41:28] they left immediately
[1:41:34] may i state it to you because you don't
[1:41:36] read a lot but
[1:41:38] at the first nicean council at 3 25 a.d
[1:41:42] it was not over whether there was three
[1:41:43] gods or one god it was whether jesus was
[1:41:46] of another substance or a demon god
[1:41:50] you know another substance
[1:41:52] funny they're doing that now with the
[1:41:53] river jordan doctrines
[1:41:56] that they say he wouldn't god then
[1:41:57] become god god left him that's gonna
[1:41:59] yeah
[1:42:01] but you see
[1:42:04] these are the words
[1:42:06] paraphrasing it
[1:42:08] when the people went down their shore
[1:42:10] they stood up there and fought a lot of
[1:42:11] those things and a lot of them died at
[1:42:13] those councils
[1:42:15] prophets came in eating herbs and things
[1:42:18] and and trying to get the bride out of
[1:42:20] it right but it don't matter who it was
[1:42:22] and went out of there and didn't take it
[1:42:23] they took those doctrines with them by
[1:42:26] 606.
[1:42:29] 325 a.d they started 606 they already
[1:42:32] had the biggest portion of the world
[1:42:34] caught into their septility
[1:42:36] of the trinity
[1:42:38] that started with that one man
[1:42:41] saying that he's a like substance
[1:42:47] you see how easy satan is deceiving
[1:42:51] it doesn't matter to him how long it
[1:42:53] takes to get to your mind
[1:42:56] he'll deal with you day in and day out
[1:42:58] and he'll talk with you hey if he don't
[1:43:00] talk to you would you mind if i send him
[1:43:02] over your way
[1:43:06] you know
[1:43:08] you say when i wake up in the morning i
[1:43:10] say good morning lord most of the time i
[1:43:11] said devil heidi how you doing today
[1:43:15] because that's generally the first one
[1:43:16] that contacts me
[1:43:20] are you truthful
[1:43:24] the worst problem is is to call him the
[1:43:26] lord and be the devil
[1:43:28] right
[1:43:31] that's the worst part
[1:43:32] i wanted to get this part
[1:43:35] into our thinking
[1:43:37] then we wouldn't have no trouble when we
[1:43:39] go to the physical
[1:43:41] to start talking about
[1:43:44] you know physical matters and situations
[1:43:47] but just remember
[1:43:49] that spirit within you right now even
[1:43:51] though you're a born-again believer
[1:43:53] that spirit is still subject
[1:43:56] to satan and his ways
[1:44:02] i agree with brother level i believe was
[1:44:03] when he made the statement now if it
[1:44:05] wasn't him
[1:44:08] he said we need a baptism of the holy
[1:44:10] ghost on our brain
[1:44:12] well i'd agree with that
[1:44:14] probably help a lot because your spirit
[1:44:16] works through your brain it is not your
[1:44:17] brain now don't go that way it just
[1:44:19] works through there
[1:44:21] because that spirit realm is a part of
[1:44:23] us that
[1:44:25] reasons
[1:44:29] satan comes through and speaks to us
[1:44:31] that way but you know what god has to
[1:44:33] speak through those things too
[1:44:35] i don't understand how that he can pass
[1:44:38] through
[1:44:39] all of the wrong thinkings and things
[1:44:42] that in life
[1:44:43] and get to us to save us
[1:44:45] i don't understand that
[1:44:48] you know what
[1:44:50] because as quick as i start to try to do
[1:44:51] something wrong the bible said evil is
[1:44:54] present with me
[1:44:56] is that paul
[1:45:00] think on these things what was the big
[1:45:02] problem in the garden
[1:45:04] was for eve to listen
[1:45:08] to the beast
[1:45:11] and let him deceive her
[1:45:13] what's the biggest problem today
[1:45:16] preachers
[1:45:18] and the bride of christ listening to him
[1:45:25] i told you 40 something years ago i said
[1:45:28] you think that these doctrines and
[1:45:30] things that's going around today is very
[1:45:32] deceiving i said there's nothing like
[1:45:34] it's going to be
[1:45:36] i said it's going to come to a time that
[1:45:38] they're going to be quoting brother
[1:45:39] branham to the letter
[1:45:42] the old days they couldn't quote him to
[1:45:43] the letter because they didn't have the
[1:45:45] letter
[1:45:46] they had parts of it right
[1:45:48] but nowadays a preacher can get up to
[1:45:50] you and he can say
[1:45:51] i know this is right cause i got 240
[1:45:54] quotes
[1:46:00] but if you got one quote
[1:46:03] that doesn't fit
[1:46:07] are you going to throw it as a weightier
[1:46:09] matter that the weightier the matter the
[1:46:11] more more proof you got the more quotes
[1:46:13] you got
[1:46:15] and you know i love to quote him
[1:46:20] but you know i can take it and twist it
[1:46:22] any way i want to
[1:46:29] you know the only way you're going to
[1:46:30] know whether the person preaching to you
[1:46:31] is right or not is for you to be in the
[1:46:34] word
[1:46:36] for you to study it out
[1:46:38] for you to think it over and for you to
[1:46:41] talk to god about it
[1:46:44] right
[1:46:47] because satan is a very deceiving
[1:46:50] being
[1:46:51] and if he could deceive eve that had no
[1:46:53] problems no strong no wrong thing
[1:46:57] a beautiful situation but he could take
[1:46:59] that and gradually work through her
[1:47:03] until he could bring the whole human
[1:47:04] race
[1:47:09] right

[1:47:22] female beast used to flirt around with
[1:47:24] adam but i don't care about that that
[1:47:27] was his thoughts

[1:47:53] realm it's
[1:47:54] it's the hardest thing in the world to
[1:47:56] try to get a preacher to think because
[1:47:58] he's in any way deceived
[1:48:00] because remember
[1:48:02] he's led to the lord
[1:48:05] he's called of the lord
