========================================

okay bless you all um the reason I'm having this testimony the song We sang this morning just really reminded me and um of what I need to thank God for and I'm going to watch the time um sometimes I don't want to share my testimony CU sometimes I'm ashamed but this song really brought me out and um also Benjamin called me the other day and he said oh mommy do you know I'm going to be the Big T and uh that just reminded me I'm like my goodness it's been 20 years uh 20 years ago January 6th I got home and um my husband at that time was gone our furniture was gone and we walked in Michael and I I remember Michael saying mommy all our stuff is gone and um and then things just started happening from them I mean 8 months pregnant the first thing that came into my mind was oh my gosh where are people going to sit when they come to see the baby you know pregnant homeown that's all I thought and at that point I had had a choice to make I could either just fall apart emotionally physically spiritually or I could get up and really you know go on with the Lord the Lord strengthening me and so that's the path I took right and then uh I went out hobbled to the furniture stores you know got the couches and I remember one thing brother Dale always told me was like stay in church stay in church and that's what I've always strive to do so 20 years ago today um I was at home the baby hadn't come was supposed to come January 31st and so I said you know what since the baby's not coming let me do my taxes and I guess that's what brother on the labor so about about 9 10:00 I'm doing my tax as the labor comes on and for some reason Michael woke up and I wanted him to be asleep cuz you know when you having labor paining they coming your contract they coming nobody was home my mom was at work my dad's at home so I didn't want to call anybody I'm like okay let me get through the night and Michael comes over you know I'm leaning over breathing Michael is breathing with me I'm like Michael he's not even to yet and I'm like okay I've got to get him asleep because I he can't get through this cuz I need to do what I need to do and he needs to go asleep cuz I need to get in the bath or something hot water and he's breathing with me I'm like Mike okay so I pretended to sleep through all the pain until he felt asleep and then the next morning of course my mom came took me to the hospital I didn't want to csection cuz I knew it was more recovery time but the Lord took me through it all and at that time uh brother Dale was preaching Grace as a person I remember that and uh that kept me going and I'm so thankful to God that I'm standing here because y'all don't know what he's brought me through and I am so thankful for him I'm so thankful for a pastor that told me to stay in church no matter where I had to go I had to just keep my candle L I'm thankful for Michael I'm thankful for Benjamin I'm thankful that we've made it to the big tour with the Lord Jesus as our husband

relaxed get to see a little presentation and uh it'll be my first so y'all bear with me oh we've got a lot of pictures to show um let's read a scripture first and I'll just do my little slideshow here and then I'll let you be seated 1 Peter chap 5: 8-10 uh let's pray first oh God we're so grateful to be able to Lord share with the people uh what what they backed and uh the efforts that they that that we took down to Nicaragua Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll bless this afternoon Lord and uh help help me that you'll give me uh Clarity of mind to be able to present things in the order and and uh remember details of of what we did Grant it Lord we ask in your name Amen in 1 Peter chapter 5 it says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world and I got a translation from another another Bible that says remember that your family Believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are I think that's something that we kind of uh is it help helpful to remember that all around the world whether you got money or don't whether you're in this situation or that we're fighting the same devil we're going through the same same uh battles in our mind and in our spiritual life and uh and and and but we've got the same God that that has given us his word to overcome in every situation you can be seated um before we get started I'm I'm going to I just want to invite Sister Christine to come on up and share a few things and then we'll yeah that's a little bird are you going to use this all right oh okay gotcha BL at all I wanted to this was a verse the Sunday that we were going to get the PCR test and that would determine if we were going to go because nicaragu required this so it's Proverbs 356 trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lead not into thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths so this trip was a miracle because a week prior was the watch night and shortly after that people were coming up positive with covid so we didn't really we knew we were going to go but then all of these started coming up and so we had to hold a conference between the group that was coming and we were saying if someone comes up positive what are you going to do so we all had that set up and so we got the PCR test we were good to go so we flew out on the 11th we caught well our first flight was delayed and we missed the connecting flight so that meant we had to stay in in Houston for two days and the PCR on Sunday expired which meant we had to take another PCR test and we've already been in the plane from Atlanta to Houston where we're all breathing recycled a air from everybody in that plane and you were hearing coughing and everything but at this point at this point God worked out everything in Nicaragua already everything was set up for us they were just waiting for us to get there and so this was this was a quote that pretty much rung in my head and it said this is from brother brandom and he said and when we are doing Mission work or foreign Mission with the word of God we know we're always in the will of God and so we took the test within hours we got that it's negative so we were good to go so finally we get to go and this is just a part of from me personally this is brother joavan and sister Jessica I met her in 2017 they wanted to have kids so we gave her a prayer cloth and you guys could next you guys can just show and so there they are now with Emily when we got back the following year she was just a baby but this is a more closer thing next picture this is brother neelson he was very involved he drove us around a lot and that's his wife sister Gabby she also got a prayer cloth and then when we got back next picture that's their son Samuel and next picture this is um Carlos and Shon they weren't able to have kids and I specific they dropped us off at the airport and before I got out of the car I just handed her a pair cloth and I told her you know this is for the desire of your heart whatever it is and I knew what it was so the next picture that's their daughter now she's Nazareth that's her name next you guys can just scroll through the following the next one this is brother elaser and marari they phys biologically couldn't have kids and Louise was the one that gave brother elaser a fair cloth for them and then in the next picture that's where they have the baby so they had a big party for her cuz she just turned one the next picture this couple she didn't want any prayer cloth but I said well you can have two and so in the next picture in this last trip they have two girls the younger one she's five months her name that's Abby the bigger one and the younger one is Tammy so I I think you guys can just scroll through these are more recent pictures next that's Amil now that's Genesis hesis that's samw and then the two the family right there and um in the next picture oh that's nasad right there in the next picture the girls Nyla and Jordan I put them to work because and they knew it's a mission trip and they knew they were going to work so this is at the camp and we were washing cuz the sisters in the kitchen already knew what they were doing so I didn't want to be in their way but I said I can wash dishes and I got two helpers with me so I got them doing that and so these are the they didn't have enough plates for everybody they didn't have enough cups they didn't have enough um spoons and forks so as people were giving them giving us their used up plates we had to wash them real quick because the second round of people need them so we had to watch them quickly next and so I had to get Jordan I told her say plateau and then they'll just give you their dirty plates so I had her go around and and collect that and the reason the reason I had them do that when whenever we go to a mission trip for me personally is that I wanted to I think my goal is to break the barrier or the perception that these Americans we have to serve them that they're here they're coming here they're from The Prophet's country and we need to serve them and they give you the best that they can and so it it really shocks them when we're willing to get our hands dirty in those greasy water and in the plates that they ate out of it really puts them to shock that somebody from the states is willing to do that for them so I made it a point I always do that but since I had these two girls I said you guys are going to wash dishes today so next this is um maybe you can this is a sink it's a wooden sink and I just wanted to show you this is for me personally um that's where Jordan and Nyla wash dishes in a sister's house and next I think this is a video oh it's a picture and I think the next one is a video so you have to get water I mean you don't have a faucet right there and the chickens are outside and I wanted to show that that's brother Corey I that's all I wanted to show and the next picture and this is the stove that the sister made breakfast out for us so and I think I don't know if that's the last picture okay this is the one that I wanted to finish off of um I also did want to mention that this trip made me appreciate my girls because it was just like I just let them be I was more worried about Nyla and Jordan they just got so used to it and I really I came back thinking well they're really to this and it's just second nature for them but this is the picture I wanted to to leave you guys with because this is disposable spoons and forks and we were washing them because we didn't have enough and I know that it's been more than a year that they've been using this because a lot of them had stains and we had to get rid of the stains and we had to get toothbrushes and scrub it off dip it in you know bleach and stuff and get it out and they didn't have enough and they've been using this over and over and over and you see it in many houses they have plastic spoons and forks they don't throw it away and we reuse that and so it's it's always a humbling experience because I find myself complaining about my kitchen counter and then I go back I go back down there and then you see their kitchen and I come back going I love my kitchen counter that was all I wanted to show you guys I think there's another picture but it's the same [Applause] thing uh just a word of warning I'm probably not going to go at that speed I I'll be honest I took I took so many pictures I took I took over a thousand pictures and I'm not prepared to show them all here but um I do have a lot and I I I really wanted to come back and and uh communicate to everybody kind of what we went through and share like uh not just places we preached but just kind of the experience so I have [Music] some okay I don't know why I did different but well all right so um this this is kind of an overview of where we went and um you can see from we went from Atlanta to Houston and uh down to Nicaragua and I'm just going to go through our our journey because like Christine said we've got a little testimony and kind of how we got down there and we we were sitting there in the Atlanta airport and waiting to to get on our flight and all of a sudden we started seeing news of that FAA grounding flights that um they weren't allowing uh some of some of the planes to take off if if they were still on the ground so you know naturally we started um what's what's going on we w we we had our our our apps open with the to see you know with the the where our flights were and the flight we were about to get on to Houston was on time or or I'm sorry the flight that we were from Houston to Nicaragua was on time but the flight we were about to get on to Houston was was delayed uh or yeah that's it was delayed it was delayed so it naturally caused the flight from Houston to uh Nicaragua to be we missed it so we we got on our flight to to Houston and we made it over to Houston and and uh here you can say we were in a three-hour line trying to get all of that straightened out and we began to wonder that's when you know you you start having mind battles what's going on you know you start wondering if if everything's everything's working according to plan and but you know God has a plan uh even though sometimes we don't understand it at that moment i' I've got a picture here we we were so hungry after we we we uh it took us that long to get to Houston and it was about 4:00 in the afternoon by the time we made it through that line and the girls were like I got to get something to eat so they ran over and got uh got them some food real quick and um you know makes you think of Romans 8:28 we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them that are who are called according to his purpose so uh you know many times you don't understand what's happening but there is a purpose to everything now we we this is we were sitting there in that in that hotel room watching the Wednesday night service and we happened to go and grab some barbecue and you know we were wondering if this maybe maybe had something to do with why our labor labor was we met this fell named Justin and uh got the chance to talk to him at the at the barbecue place and he was just a really great guy and we all got a a our photograph with him and everything got to spend some time with him but like Christine said there's only one flight to Nicaragua per day and all of us needed to find a seat because you know you can imagine what chaos that would cause if we got to Nicaragua differently and nobody speaks Spanish you got to get through customs and Louise isn't there and Louise Louise was like our he was our papy he was and and Christine Christine Louis and Christine were taking care of us so we were we you know we were all thinking we we we need Louise we can't get there without him and then all the covid tests I can't remember how many covid tests we needed to get P positive but that or negative but five four five okay I thought there was more than that but that's still a big number um but they all had to come back negative again like Christine said after after all of the being around people and everything so we ended up uh getting on another flight got we got it rescheduled and we got on the flight and made it down to managa here we are landing an eaten Subway in the managa airport um going through customs and then we met uh Pastor neelson is the uh brother that uh she just put on one of the one of the brothers that she just showed uh he's the one he's the he was a fantastic brother and I saw a bunch of pictures of him but he he was pretty much our tour guide while we went around pretty much everywhere where and he was he's such a wonderful brother he just he gave up his time I don't have enough to say positive about this brother he he gave up his time for like a week with us and um with like like brother Lis was sharing some things going on at home and uh he just sacrificed to to be with us and and drive us around and stay in hotels with us and um so we loaded up everything on top of the car and we uh started driving to managa to the first church because um as as is normally the case you hit the ground running so we were going to speak at a little church Wednesday night and um I think I've got some videos here see through you you have fun with those Brothers down there so we ended the first church we went to is I've I'm I stole like U Sister Christine some of these pictures from Facebook this is Pastor M kisc this is how he spells it on Facebook so brother milky um so you can see on the map uh it's right there at the top of managa managua's um uh well I I can't describe it on the map you you saw the the bigger map earlier but it's right next to the to the this Lake here um so This Is Us pulling up to the church and you can see managa is it's pretty it's different it's uh crowded teaming with life I uh I'm sorry for the Bad videography but you can see there's a bus pulling up and all kinds of things going on the street Tire dealerships all around and when we turn the corner you can hear me say is that the church cuz cuz I wasn't expecting it to look like there there it is on the left and we just rolled up and that's right there on the left in front of that in front of that car on so that kind of gives you an idea of what it was like so we we roll up and the M comes out to meet us and um we greet him and and they're getting the church ready getting everything prepared and we we spoke for them it that that was a a a wonderful ice breaker because um just to kind of get things started because you can immediately sense that this is such a humble wonderful little group of people and they respond so honestly astonished me how well they responded to the service you know I was I I preached my heart out and brother brother Louis was interpreting and um I feel like about probably about half that church came up to the front for prayer and and uh pastors were coming up and uh that that were visiting and let me just add something there brother Bob brother Bob preached that night I never told him anything about this church I know the history I've preached at this church several times the P the previous Pastor from this church just passed away in 2020 so this is his son son right there brother milis who's the pastor now but there were some issues some some things just like any church has but there are some specific issues that have been going on Church split that took place a couple of years ago and brother Bob was hitting some things that he didn't even know anything about so that hence the reason why the people were so impressed it must be God speaking to us so yeah you can see this is Brother neelson on the right and brother melkisedek on the left and then all of us together and uh there's there's brother Michael everybody loved how tall brother Michael was and I I I just want to say you know you when you're with on in in another country well this is my first time being in another country it sounds I don't want to say it like I I've done it before but when when you're riding two and a half hours and you don't know where you're going through the countryside and you know you you've got a new experience and everything I tell you what it makes a whole lot of difference with the people that you're with and and being with Louise and Christine and their family and Nyla and Jordan and Michael it just made it the whole experience so much more enjoyable you know we were going through the to I think I've got some recordings or videos here somewhere but when you're going through the uh the night and you you know it's it's a long car ride and everybody starts singing and um it it's it's wonderful and this was just a wonderful group to go with and um like Christine said I'm I'm so proud of the example that our young people people showed to everybody in Nicaragua this uh everywhere they went they they demonstrated a real Christian character so then uh that night right after preaching so we had flown all day we were tired uh we just preached we had a a little let me go back to the food real quick so you can see what they cook for us this is all uh uh I guess that's that's steak and chicken monkey meat I'm just joking that was a lot of monkey meat jokes and and that's uh I I think that cantaloupe drink and I say that cantaloupe drink cuz that earn reputation that was it was good um so then then that night we we drove to from managa to Chinandega which you can see on the map it's about a 2 and 1 half hour ride and I put there in Gringo time and Gringo time is supposed to take 2 and 1/2 hours and in Nicaragua time who knows who knows when you're going to get there so we like for we started off and just to kind of share I mean just sharing the experience we we started driving around managa and um and it just so happened that the person I was sitting to next to on the plane was telling me about all these likes that the I guess the president of Nicaragua's wife had put up in Managua and there was all this controversy about that because it was steal on electricity and stuff so anyway I thought these lights were interesting because of that and uh so we begin to drive from anaga this is what it's like driving around in Nicaragua you're going to be tailgating and and uh in the wrong lane and and that was you can hear everybody singing that's a duplicate video but we we drove around and uh we ended up going back into managa to meet somebody and it took us it took us quite a while to get up to Chinandega that's that's part of the experience it was it was a lot of fun and uh you can see the streets of chiner it's just uh it's it's real interesting we we ended up at the hotel in uh I'm sorry the streets of magaga we ended up in Chinandega this is what the little hotel looked like um out in front the the street in front was busy um all all kinds of things going on people riding by on bikes it was really interesting how that everywhere you looked there was there was religious signage like this Pharmacy named after El shedi um people riding by in bikes and horses right in the middle of the street and this is what the shower looked like and so you had to uh turn it to the right to get warm water turn it to the left to get skull and hot water or something like something like that I yeah the left left is uh cold water the right is warm water um and then the in the I'm sorry the middle is warm water and then the the yeah it's warm hot or cold so then uh we went we went we had a day off on Saturday so we went down to Lon I'm going to just just to save time we're already at 3:00 so I'm going to kind of skim through some of these pictures but we went to this Catholic church and which was Zoe mentioned that in her little test that's really interesting seeing some of these just how the uh this is because we had an off day this day brother neelon he had to go to Honduras that day to attend the wedding so we kind of had an off day so I said Hey Brother Nelson why don't you just let me uh use the vehicle that he was driving us around he said sure So we went and drove to Lon which was about 45 minutes from Chinandega very touristy spot very popular city in Nicaragua well and so we spent the day there and I before we get out of Layon I'm just going to this is a map of of like part of Le on where we were and you can see there's a little red dot down there where we uh on the left hand side where we parked the car and so when I got back to the car when I got back to the car that car was parked next to the edge like to next to the curb and so I said Louise just pull back so I can get in the car real quick well he pulled back everybody got in the car and and then the door shut and he just just pulled off and left me on the street and this is a this is a video of him him riding away around the corner and I watched him drive away and now if you're if you're in a city like this that where everything looks the same and and you see the car and you don't speak Spanish that's a weird feeling I I had to I had to do it it was so nanny I told him I was going to tell on him I was going to tell you [Laughter] he needs to be gotten but that was fun um so then we went on on Sunday uh we preached for brother uh Manuel MOA that's right and so brother um brother marlone is a minister at brother Nelson's church and he came and picked us up is that is that right yeah brother brother Maron so we got the brother do you want to say something it was just this service uh it was a joint service it was three churches in in in in in one in one place so the the house was pretty packed and that was just a blessing to see the three churches just come into you know one Accord and say hey we're here to uh to just uh listen to the word of God so yeah that they they seem really receptive and uh it it's a it seems like a good indicator that appreciated your message when their Facebook profile has your picture in it so I'm assuming that everything went well but so far I don't think anybody in this church has our has our face our pictures in their Facebook profile but uh yeah they they they seemed like they really actually brother brother Manuel just uh actually messaged me on Facebook to tell me how that they're looking forward to me coming back and everything so we we uh we just just really had a wonderful time down there and um oh I also want to mention that brother um brother Louise felt inspired after the service this is after after I preached I was taking pictures over there to ask brother Michael up to say a few words and he just did a wonderful job I don't think I unfortunately have a video but I think you put it in the WhatsApp um uh Christine took a video somewhere yeah so uh we sure appreciate that he represented the church well and uh had a I just you spoke on a scripture I forget what scripture it was but you were speaking on a few things and it was it was wonderful so we sat down at 8 after after church just wanted to add that in so much that brother Emanuel the pastor asked brother Michael to come and he said come and speak for us and brother Michael said I'm not a preacher and he said brother Michael said I could teach Sunday school he said well just come and do a Sunday school lesson then now after Sunday afternoon after the morning service we um let me go back real quick this this is how our luggage went everywhere we went on top of the car those those luggage racks were really neat everywhere you went you're you're look and I still unfortunately I still have dirt on my iPad from Nicaragua from riding around on the top of the car but that's how it goes um so that afternoon we we went over to Mario and a scar Scarlet's home and U this is this is the home that the church actually helped to fund so we went over there and were um fortunate enough blessed enough to be able to kind of speak and dedicate the the home yeah if you all remember a couple of years ago brother Dale said hey let's build this this this family a house it it was about $44,000 this is their house and so we I asked brother Neilon that their Pastor I said brother n you think it'd be good uh if we could go and just have a little meeting in their house and just just dedicated he said that's a wonderful idea brother Luis so we went in there and had the dedication and brother Bob you know uh said a few words and helped dedicate and we all got around afterwards and had a prayer dedicated the the family really every day almost just about to get messages from that family just so appreciative of their little house uh because the way they obtained it it was it was in a hardship situation that they had but uh they're just very thankful and they send their greetings and that home has become a little blessing because I think they had a a ministers meeting and they had they were able to uh put up about five or 10 ministers there and slept in these hammocks um that went to Brother Nelson's church that or went that so that they could attend brother Nelson's church was just right around the corner so this is $4,000 this is what you can get but I mean they use it to the max just $4,000 can go all the way can can go a very long way so this is this is what you help support now um brother Nelson's I've got a little quick video of brother Nelson's mom's she's got like a little shot where people come up to this window and and buy things and as I pan quickly around you can you can see all the little things that she sells that was such a neat little setup it's just a real Umble it's actually part of her home and uh a several people that we visited had kind of little setups like this it was really interesting that they would sell things out of their home so we went back to uh towards managa and this is the view at night looking over an Overlook down in Managua and um so on Sunday night we went we spent the night in uh San jge Rivas is thatas Rivas and uh I'm just going to quickly go through some of these just so you can kind of get a sense of the experience neelson was putting a luggage back on there and that was in preparation to go get on the ferry the next morning uh to om tee which is this island that has two volcanoes on it and that was pretty neat so we loaded up we got the car on the ferry we loaded everything up and away we went um just to save time I've actually combined some of the pictures from before from going and and coming together but um that was that was an experience seeing the volcano get closer and closer and it's alive it's an active volcano so when we landed you can see there's a there was a map on the wall that kind of shows where everything is and um Neilson was pointing out here that we were going to drive around uh the the big island where the big volcano is and go over the little middle part and and ride around to brother Juan's Church down at the at the bottom there and so that's where what we did and you can see there's we we got a little vantage point where you can see both volcanoes at once the big one in the back and the U concepion is the big one and madas is the one on the right and that's one of my favorite P a't that a cool picture Louise standing in front of the volcano yeah that was neat cows in the road all the all the roads just went went around the volcano so it was just going around in the circle and then across and so so we ended up at at brother Juan's church just a real um little church um and so This Is Us walking up to his home and um I think Christine showed some pictures earlier here of how you know them preparing food for us so we sat and ate with them um this is this is them ribbing Michael about um not drinking coffee when they heard he didn't drink coffee boy that open from the door for all kinds of laughs you don't drink coffee in Nicaragua or Honduras Michael's the only one really that can travel around and look good anywhere he goes with a tie with a shirt and a tie I mean everybody's wearing jeans t-shirts and everything Michael was he said we were going to the church that night but I mean he he he knows how to work it you can see this strange tree that has uh you know you got to be careful that you don't put your hand on it to rest because it's got spikes on it so we had church that night and um another wonderful Service uh I remember speaking on several different things and a lot of different people came up U some of these sisters came up and and were asking prayer for specifically those those needs like you know kidney stones I I don't ever preach on kidney stones but I was preaching on kidney stones and somebody came up that um had a problem with kidney stones and then so after after the service this is uh the little road in front of the front of the church and uh just a quick little background on that church is the only Message Church in that area and it's only been there about 13 years 13 to 15 years it's when the brother he was a Pentecostal and some brothers from Managua came and preached uh taught them the message they accepted the message and so it's the only little church there you pray for these brothers because they they need a lot of teaching they need a lot of um you know a lot of Bible Doctrine type teaching and uh so uh it was wonderful to see them again I just I just mentioned this um um we stopped at this this little restaurant uh to to get for everybody to get coconut ice cream and this is where I was I sat there and I had the opportunity to just talk to brother Nielson for a little bit and we started somehow we ended up on Daniel 70 weeks and uh yeah believe it or not and and I started he was asking me what what my view is it of it is so we just had a little quick quick discussion and and he he came back with that's exactly how I see it there seven years after the Rapture and so I that was that was really edifying to you think you think nobody else is believing things the way you do but like I said the same God is is all around the world and he's leading us and and and they have less messages translated in their languages than than we do we have all of them and yet they still got that same revelation of Daniel 70 weeks so yeah uh so uh Tuesday morning we had breakfast at brother Corey's and um you can see on the map where where about where he is and just a precious little brother they they cooked us food on uh uh on on with this setup I I guess it's just fire um so there's brother Cory there's another store so they had a little store where this little boy was coming up to get one diaper one diaper at a time you see all the the sisters were were being hel and then one of the brothers went out and got coconuts for us I you know it's interesting that I think we've all seen probably the same coconut tree that in Louis's slide decks but now I got to we all got to experience that same thing and now we can tell about our experience that's that's how it is in the gospel sometimes isn't it you somebody else can have an experience but when you experience it then now you know what it's like you know we know where that coconut tree is we know how those what those coconuts taste like we can tell somebody about it um fresh coconut water and it was interesting cuz Christine wanted she was like I wanted some coconut water didn't tell anybody except for the brother Pastor that we was there with and he said yeah we could get some coconut water here with the next day when we visited brother Cory's house I don't think he knew but the brother say Hey you want some coconut water it's like God knows your heart you know your desires and he's got what he right there when you need it yes so we went around and uh to visit with several Believers uh that uh with Brother Juan and brother neelson they just kind of we just kind of went with them to to to tag along really and there was a little monkey up in a tree doing his thing we run around the island and and visited with different Believers which was which was kind of a neat experience um just real quick to show you that that night we stayed in this Lo these are the stars in Nicaragua which I was really excited about seeing the stars and they were they were amazing but this little real um little little Hotel Hot uh there's there's that frog that caused so much commotion when we got there it was it was in the I think it was at the bathroom where the sh hour yeah it stirred up quite a bit of fuss there's a frog in this in the bathroom but this is where we stayed and you know it was about it was about 90° at night no air conditioning nothing to cool you off but fans and you know it was it wasn't that bad I took a picture of the light switch just so you can kind of see these style of light switches was everywhere and uh and late at night I got up about 4 in the morning and and took a picture of these Leaf Cutters climbing up this tree which was neat they were tearing that tree up so you can see the volcano back in the distance so Wednesday we uh we got up and we went to camp we rode the fairy back and we we we wound up at camp and uh Bella was playing in in the in the band and uh Nyla and and Michael and everybody got to sing some specials I don't think I have a video of those but they were sure a blessing and um Louise was asked to speak Thursday night and did a wonderful job speaking on uh Lazarus coming forth from the grave and uh here's an example of some of the food we ate sitting down with that was one of the highlights of the trip was just being able to sit down with some of these other belie uh ministers that had so many experiences we there's Zach Wallace and brother Paco who's just goes into the jungle in that green shirt and and and and Minister uh takes the takes the gospel deep in the jungle um there they are singing a song This Youth Camp had probably I would say maybe it was about 250 maybe 300 Youth and and uh somewhere around there I was not expecting to preach on this trip at all I came strictly to interpret for brother Bob we had a certain itinerary but when you get there the brothers are like how are you going to come here and not preach so they got me to preach at the youth camp and uh but we we had a good time yeah and one of the I just want to show these pictures brother Burley was preaching on in the mornings and he got brother Louise and Christine up there to to kind of act out um being uh going free at the end at end of the seven-year release and you know Louise he just really hammed it up and brother Burley said he had never had anybody acted out quite like Louis and Christine did before so the kids were laughing and it was it was a great time I I took a picture of this little this little truck as the kidss were leaving camp they this little group I believe Louise can keep me honest but they were they were going back up into the mountains and they there was a little sister in the back they had a little baby and they were just all cramming their luggage into the back and they were going to drive hours back up into the mountains where their where their homes were about 6- hour drive up up to the mountain they came that far to get the word so Sunday um the last I think uh we left uh the girls went home uh Saturday and we stayed Sunday to to uh Minister for brother Emanuel and um I this is the Sunday that that me and brother Louise split up and he went to preach for brother Nelson while I stayed with brother Danny Torres to interpret for me and preach for brother Manuel at his church in managa brother Manuel also has a little little uh what do you call it Outreach that he that we preached at that I preached at in the afternoon um but I don't have really any good pictures from the morning because um I didn't have a photographer but this is just us kind of talking at McDonald's this is Brother uh Louise I took a picture of him saying uh let brother Bob preach well brother Emanuel was asking me to preach that afternoon at the Outreach that I was I was preaching that morning in Chinandega which is about 2 hours from from where the Outreach is so I told Brother Manuel because I really didn't want to preach but I and and I I said look brother Bob has already prepared a sermon for that evening so why don't we let him speak plus he's our guest Minister and I I'll be more than glad to interpret for him so I was able to uh convince brother Manuel yes this is what their little church looks like and some of the homes this is actually where we stayed uh that night is over to the left but the little church tabernaculo gilgal um and in the afternoon we preached at um Monte tore which is um the little Outreach that the church actually uh put money in to buy the land this this church about two years ago you guys helped to pay for this land where this little Outreach is at so right now they have not officially started building the church but that's the spot where they're going to build so they just have something there temporary so that afternoon everybody loaded up we had some some good Fellowship got some pictures taken and um it this we all went over to brother Manuel's house and uh for the final night and and uh this is this is Brother Nelson's little boy in the truck trying to drive there's H the brother and sisters whose home we did dedicated brother Mario and sister Scarlet there and uh this is this is one of my favorite pictures this this there was uh so much so much talking and laughing everything it honestly felt a lot like Monica's family when we when they get together um but you can kind of see that uh we we slept with a mosquito net over the bed um just real humble home I had I I propped a uh there's a little couple that g actually gave me their whole home to spend the night in um you know had it it was an awesome experience to be able to just uh to be able to share their their home um but we just propped a propped a piece of wood up against the door and that was the lock and ate a good breakfast that morning and then we're getting ready to go off to the airport there's brother Zachary Wallace and if you don't if you don't know Zachary Wallace he's a wonderful little missionary brother he's been like 15 different countries um I I I really cherished the time I got to spend with him right in the back of the pickup truck to and from camp and he was sharing some just amazing stories of of of uh you know problems that had been resolved down there in Nicaragua and Honduras just uh that were resolved by people loving one another and um so it just a wonderful time of sh Fellowship so we got all loaded up uh got situated in the airport and flying flying out looked out the window and there's one of those volcanoes I don't know which one that was there were so many volcanoes but it was just a nice way to say goodbye and back back in the States so I I want to I just want to close with with reading this quote I to to me this was this was truly a life-changing experience I honestly you know I've heard a lot of people say well did is there anything that you uh did you did you hate it did you not like it I I I I really can't think of anything negative at all about it it was a wonderful trip wonderful people it's a wonderful to have the opportunity to be able to share the gospel with people in another country and I I I can't say enough for how much I appreciate brother Lise and Christine for kind of putting all this together and inviting all the young people along and myself and setting this up so that I'd have an opportunity to speak at these churches um I you know uh one thing one thing that I think kind of escapes us is uh down there you know brother Louis is regard he was invited to speak at the camp uh everybody highly regards him and um you know we kind of we've kind of got accustomed to one another up here but down there he's looked upon um with great esteem and uh so I just certainly appreciate I appreciate their love and their their gift to me to be able to go and minister to this to these people in Nicaragua and Lord willing it won't be my last so but I I want to close with this quote and then we'll turn it over to brother Wade for the communion brother Ram said in that day on Calvary he said he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself self he live for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others others God bless you church and we'll stop there brother [Applause] way appreciate you we appreciate these brothers I know a lot of you have never never been to a foreign country but it will change your life it'll CH it'll change your perspective of the things that you look at and and the things we take for granted we all got Bibles we all got the message we all got everything we need and sometimes we're a little bit dilatory about it them people that's their life that's their life and and they put their whole life into it and and makes us ashamed of ourselves sometimes that uh that they're given a lot less like brother Louise said there's only several hundred tapes and and books in Spanish all these years in Spanish the second the second most common language in the world and somebody dropped the ball should have made every sermon there was in Spanish cuz cuz it's uh it's just horrible that they're so far behind they they don't have we have all the information we got 1100 sermons we have to have no one interpret any of those no one you can sit and listen to it yourself you can sit and talk yourself but when you've only got 3 or 400 of that 1100 you're missing a piece of it there's a piece missing somewhere brother L by the way just to give you an example of that right now they have about 900 something messages now but they were not interpreted or translated by voice of God only only a certain portion of that was maybe a quarter of those yep the other ones were translated by brothers who I I personally know from V uela and some other brothers around Central South America that were paid by Churches here in the states to translate those messages and now you find them on message Hub and so a lot of them they're able to be able to print out books from the message Hub in Spanish they got about 900 so or so right now give you an example of that there's Brothers over there just like there is here who are against uh are opposed to youth camps as well um but and so I there was we were talking there in the V vehicle in one of those instances and I pulled up a quote where brother brandom said that he was talking about Becky and how he wanted Becky to go to that youth camp that youth rally down there to receive the Holy Ghost and how he was encouraging her to go you can go and look at it I think it's in 1963 after he preached the seals right but and so the brothers they said we'd never seen that quote before and uh and and and one of the brothers finally found them the sermon where was that they had never seen that quote before cuz it it was so so uh so rare to to just find the the books you know or the message where it was at so it's that's just an example of that yeah that's why we're so fortunate because if we need an answer we know we just pull it up like I said we don't need an interpretation we've already got it but they need to have an interpretation they need somebody to tell them what it says in Spanish so that they can can do Can U the same is that never seen that quote before I never seen a quote about cremation till Aaron read it last night somebody asked about being cremated and brother Aaron if you look up the word cremate or cremation brother Brown speaks about three or four times on that where it doesn't matter you know about being it's just a personal preference if you want to or not so uh it just accelerates the process Bible says ashes to ashes dust to dust so it just accelerates the process and it's just you know but I'd never seen that quote and I had it in English so think about something though you're looking for it in Spanish and they haven't translated that book yet they haven't translated that tape it stops everything because there's no other way unless somebody like Luis or somebody says hey it says in certain certain message and you tell them about it in English and then you can send them a quote but uh we just we thank God that uh we got Able Body ministers that can go remember a long time ago brother Dale would go a good bit and he go to Jamaica and he's been to the Philippines he's been to Brazil and Ireland and different places and now we're able and I've been to Jamaica 11 times so and a couple times with the Philippines so we're getting where we're in the older stage and then we got younger guys here and that's what God does in the economy of God he always has somebody waiting in the wings he's always got somebody that he can the Next Generation that comes up because he he's never going to have a gap God can't he's not ever going to have a gap he's got this thing all laid out where there won't be a gap in the program and I was thinking this morning about brother Lis being here and I mean we love brother Lu and we know why he's here he's here for the word of God but he's also here to help take this gospel and even interpret somebody else now and we've been able to what I was thinking was it's kind of expanded us a little bit to where we can have ministers here that can't speak English that that that 10 or 15 years ago before brother L started coming to church here I'm giving you a rose man whole bouquet okay you're welcome one of them big ones that go around your neck we couldn't have certain people that we had before we could not we'd have to find an interpreter but we have one sitting around here and a good one a holy ghost filled one that knows to do you know what the word of God says and then you know then he can easily interpret for for brother Bob and the different on so we just appre brother brother Louise to be able to to to be a part of our family and part of the family of God and also before we before we finish uh we'll stand and and start with the communion service we're all we always have been um mission-minded um now there's a lot of other churches that that they have Mission funds and and they have take up special offerings and we do certain times take up special offerings but I know like I said before brother Bob and brother Luise they're ministers here so the church pays for their plane ticket to where they need to go but there's a lot of other money involved as far as having to to get money together and and you just don't know how much I mean it takes money ask brother Michael and some of them you know they hey you know it takes money to live you can't uh can't go over there and they give you everything all right and then you also do like brother Dale he' take a two suit suitcases full of clothes and come back with the clothes on his back literally right come back with the clothes on his back he'd take two full suitcases when he got done he'd take the two empties and put one inside the other one zip it up and he'd bring it back home empty he left all his clothes there and that's what you do you you give you know we we're able to do that and and I appreciate brother Dale and all the ones that's had anything to do with the the church and and and judging that we need to do Mission work there's a lot of people just like brother Louise said about uh youth camps there's people and this message is not going to send their kids to a youth camp they're not going to even um um you know they not going to even give any money they're going to support them at all and we could be the same way in Mission work cuz there's a lot of people that don't do Mission work they do their own work around here which is fine every church is Sovereign but I than brother Dale that he's that he's had the foresight to look and see that down the road he didn't know brother Lis was coming but God did amen God did God didn't know brother Dale didn't know maybe Bob was coming to be a minister God did so we put everything in place to where now we can send people into these foreign countries and uh be able to uh not burden all of you your tithes and offerings it goes sure to run into the church but it also goes to missionary work there's a need you know and a need like brother Luis came up here several years ago about to the house we need $4,000 you got it we can't do that for everybody but if we can do our certain part then God's going to get on somebody else's heart to do another part then God's going to get another church to do another part we're not you know it's not the full brunt of this church you know um supporting Nicaragua no we support a need we have brothers that have a need we support a need then another church will support another need so that's the way God works he works as economy like that so don't worry they got there that's a nice little building for $4,000 I mean it's functional and they're out of the weather and you were able to go dedicate it and see it so go ahead way just wanted to wanted to just give a special I guess shout out to my wife because and and really this was her idea to do this to bring the young people with us it was never in my intentions to ever do anything like that but uh it it was a good idea and I think it it was it was of the Lord yeah and so in the midst yeah yeah I appreciate I appreciate her because sometimes these ideas come to her mind and in the moment I'm thinking well what about the logistics and all that you know I if their parents don't go I'm not going they parents got to be but you know what these young people that went with us you know they they behaved they did they they maybe they were felt uncomfortable at certain times but they didn't show it yeah and uh uh and so they Trek through and I just really appreciate their efforts and uh but in within the midst of trying Christine trying to deal with the girls and and you know and of course dealing with our daughters as well and and she's also dealing with the money as well she's managing every every money that that that you guys gave I put her in charge of it because I've got to fellowship and be with the other brothers I've got you know they want to talk to me and things like that so she took care of all of that and by by God's help we were able to use up just about every single thing that you guys gave amen and that is our mission and if we if we see that we have anything left over we just kind of just give it away right amen uh to what we'll see what needs are there out there and we say hey this is this is from us just take it from a blessing from the Lord so don't think one bit that we' taken that money and used it for personal things no it's stayed down there absolutely and so we just appreciate each and everyone of you all that gave appreciate your offerings God knows who that $1 bill or $20 bill that you gave or whatever you gave where it went to and it blessed someone else amen and I believe God will tell us that we get to the other side where all things is made new and everything's where we ain't got to get up and go to work or anything thing and our mind is not so cluttered or it won't be cluttered we'll have a we'll have a a new body and we'll have our we'll have our senses inlightened somebody's going to walk up to you and say hey God just spoke to me and told me that that $20 you put in the collection plate it changed my life because I was able with that $20 to drive to a camp or drive to a service where i' have not been able to do that so that will be so you think well I'm not doing anything yeah you're doing something if you do it for God it'll never return void if you're doing it for yourself but if you'll do it for God and say look no no strings attached here take this money take it down there if you see a need we trust our brothers if we see a need that that needs to be dealt with and you deal with it and you just go right on and and like I said it's not for it's not for brother Luis and them to go down there and and stay in a festar hotel and and you know rent get a a rental car that's got air conditioning no we live with the people uh I when I tell people that I've been to Jamaica 11 times cuz a lot of people say yeah we've been to Jamaica they stayed at the sandals or they stayed at the you know you know brother John you know what I'm talking about that you know I I went to the Philippines well yeah I stayed in a festar motel no I've never stayed in a motel in Jamaica ever I did in the Philippines one time but not in Jamaica never stay I always stayed with the people and when you stay with the people you get a real perspective of their day-to-day life first place I stayed the first time I went I took a bath with a tea cup and a bucket of water and the water was drawn from a sister a common Anderson knows what I'm talking about a common place that they made a a concrete to come down like this and it just held rainwater you lowered the 5 gallon bucket down you pulled the 5 gallon bucket up and guess what what you didn't wash with you drank yeah of course you had to heat it with you know you heated it up but but see what you that's their day-to-day life wash clothes man we all we do here in America we just push buttons no you saw you saw what their dishwasher looked like over there it was called Jordan and Nyla yeah it was a Nyla Edition the Jordan Edition but all we do is we Mash May tag and you know we call the repair man as soon as it don't work they can't do that and to wash there plastic spoons and forks and knives that blows my mind but you know what they wanted that was the best they could provide for the guest they had now some of us would look at you know what we do we throw them away right we throw them away we never have you ever washed a plastic fork or a spoon or a knife you have but some people hasn't I do it at work do it at work brother Joe be careful with the spoons and the forks it's work Richard don't use it after Louise uses it but we don't think anything about that but you know what we got a table I or or or a shelf or a drawer full of what silverware if we need some more guess what we go buy some more silverware but they can't do that and they're just the happiest people like Bob I think that's what kind of got Bob they're just so happy you'd think oh man I'd be so depressed if I got over there and be no no they were happy you know why because they were happy in the Lord they put their heart in the Lord's work and not everything else so let's stand to our feet and we'll uh take communion thank you for all all of you for coming and being tentative and uh all the things of the day brother Ryan come on up here we'll get you involved Terence is going to call you the B team too so I'm going to go ahead and call bring the B team up but he's got to help you cuz he's the pro so he's got to have a little help for the for the uh um the U the B team go back over there go over there H you need a prayer CL okay all right we'll come up here we do that right now one okay okay let's pray dear heavenly father Lord this prayer clock Lord where it's going to go father I pray that it will as we were saying not return void but would accomplish Lord as your scripture says they took cloth off of Paul and even evil spirits were driven out of people because of that Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that where this cloth has got to go that it will do what it says it's supposed to do Lord and you'll help this brother Lord that it goes to Lord we appreciate Lord the time that we have to do this Lord thank you for allowing us to Bow our heads and pray to you father we thank you in Jesus name amen sorry about that didn't give enough time all right okay yes one Heavenly Father Lord our s knows what this Force you've seen it many times and Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that we're wherever it goes Lord that it will accomplish what our sister has desired in her heart father we pray that you would just bless the person this is going to also Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen all right everybody all M's clear now for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the same Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this this do ye in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this you do as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself that's why we stop that's why we have a word of prayer examine yourself Lord forgive me of my sins forgive me of doing this forgive me of being dilator this week or maybe like brother Brown said if you'' done something to somebody that you can't get to he said go ahead and take communion he said but you better make that right that's right all right when you go make this thing right for whatever you need to do but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eth and drinketh what damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and Paul tells the Corinthians the rest he'll set in order when he comes let's have a moment of Silent prayer brother Brown said pray pray for your pastor pray for yourself pray for the church and pray for this communion that we're about to take thank you for all things Lord thank you for the testimonies that we've we've been given lord of the work that's being done in another country Lord several thousand miles away Lord they love you just as much as much as we do father and I pray that we'll be together Lord one day we'll be able to sit down and talk to each other and realize what a wonderful time we had going and coming and flights and being delayed but all that's a part of the economy Lord that's part of you and I appreciate I thank you Lord for bringing them back safe and I pray that You' Lord give them a desire to go back again father if the Lord carries in Jesus name we pray amen the Bible said he took bless bread and he blessed it Lord thank you for this bread lord it's been made with holy hands it's been made and prepared exactly the way you told us to and father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that you Sanctified Lord in the nourishment of our bodies and Lord that we'll Lord see this as your body Lord and that we realize as the scripture says Discerning the body of the Lord that we'll know exactly what we're doing when we take this in Jesus name we pray amen yall able you were yall able L to take communion there they take while you were there no we didn't take come okay that was really um U we did it in the U Philippines one time I think we did in Jamaica a couple of times and it's really nice to see how they do it and how you know it's pretty much the same but they still do some things a little bit different and and uh it's good to see that uh not like the world the world just buys all this stuff no we've got sisters and brothers that take their time to make this all right and make it with holy hands dear heavenly father thank you for the word of the Lord thank you for this wine Lord that it has been made Lord and as it gets older it gets better Lord and as your word unfolds Lord may it get better and better for us Lord sanctify this wine Lord and the potatoes in Jesus name come morning I'll walk by the river how rest need the Ever Green Tree I will carry my cross through to the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how [Music] long then I take one more at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I'll walk by the [Music] river I'll rest Lord we'll have rest perfect rest thank you Lord how carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me I'll carry my cross through the midnight that doesn't seem very good cross in the midnight you know what that's your that's your time to give back you have your cross yeah if you can car it through the midnight I promise you you can carry it in the daylight amen you make it through we we're going to make through we're going to make it through I promise you somebody's going to make it through just say it's yourself have a positive attitude about it thank the Lord for what he's done ask him to give you more yes uh somebody was asking for something the other day and and I said hey prophet of God said ask for big things don't ask for little things ask for big things ask not God for just to for just to uh give you the Holy Ghost ask him give the k your kids the Holy Ghost that's to give your family the Holy Ghost save my family Lord don't not just me save us all all of us right and you know what if we don't ask we have not because we ask not that's right and our confession how many times we talked about that our confession what you confess that's you know you can confess Wy Wy woo or you can confess by his strip we're already healed and sister Ceta was um telling us a story about that you know she went up for prayer and she couldn't get prayed for her cuz a preacher was praying for somebody else at the time she said something just spoke to her and said by my stripes you're already healed it didn't have anything to do at that point with laying on the hands it was worth the she believe that that's part of the Bible and walked off got her healing amen you know I mean she didn't have to have you know hands laid on we do we believe in it but you don't have to you can pray you can pray to the Lord yourself right that's it there might be a time when you can't find a preacher or your pastor or somebody to do it you better be on speaking terms with a man before you do that amen that's why you need to pray and read your Bible and talk to God like talk to God like he's your he's your friend that's what he is he is your friend amen he's your brother he's your dad he's a lot of things there's one thing for sure he'll never leave us or forsake us he'll never say I didn't tell you that he'll never say no I don't think I want to do that anymore yeah he's going to do exactly what the Bible says he's going to do and he can't change it and he won't change it thank you brother Ryan good to see you up here everybody ready all mind's clear thank you Lord thank you Lord Praise Your Name Lord thank you Jesus you know some people even the message are not even taking communion anymore they said they're just a way above all this and they don't have to take communion and the Lord's already come and Jesus said do this till he comes amen and I know they said he come in 1963 that's their whole pretense well that's all right you can believe that if you want to but we still need to take communion I feel like we need to keep us clean keep us keep us alert right um many times you know youve heard a a preacher friend of mine he said we the old brother said we take communion when we feel like everybody's ready Well we'd never take communion when you feel like everybody's ready so we just tell you to get ready the first Sunday of every month just get ready and then we take our communion and you know what it really helps to know why you're taking it not that you're just a ritual it's that you're taking it because you're responsible for the body of the the Lord which is this right here this is the body of of the Lord body of the Lord somewhere else we know that but the the spiritual body of the Lord is right here this his bride so Jesus said John tells us in supper having ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and he went to God he rises from supper and he laid down his garments and took a towel and gted himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet wow and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me that's pretty plain if you don't do foot washing you're not doing all the ordinances of God and you have no part with him that's what he said Simon Peter said Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said he that is washed needeth not saved to wash feet but is clean ever wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet he taken the garments was sit down he said know you what I've done to you he asked him a question know you not what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example the man that created the feet that he was washing said you need to wash feet right all right for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent sent him if you know these things happy happy are ye if you do them happy I always remember brother Tom Ernest bless his heart uh and and he would he'd get down to wash your feet and he look at you and he said he said it's an honor to wash your feet and he really meant what he said it was an honor for him to wash your feet when we think about that or do we think it's just get in line wash your feet and leave no you're washing the feet of the Lord that's right you're washing the feet of the Lord until the Lord comes in his physical body so you're doing what God Said to do as an ordinance to keep us clean to keep us to where we are doing what God told us to do and we are doing the ordinances of God Amen and it keeps us clean Keeps Us whole Keeps Us fresh so let's buy our heads dear Lord thank you for the day you've give us thank you for this testimony we've got from Sister Christine and brother Bob and brother Lis Lord and the different ones that's before sister
