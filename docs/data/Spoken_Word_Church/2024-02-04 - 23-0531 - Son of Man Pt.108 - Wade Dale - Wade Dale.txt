come uh there will be service here so um if you don't come there'll be a service here so don't worry about that all right all M's clear everything good all right this is Son of Man part 108 we're going to look at a different angle here in just a minute and maybe not change your thought but but help you to think about godliness and not just to be so pure that we we walk around like like God zombies you know no we're not God zombies we're humans but we do have godliness living inside of us so there somewhere this thing's got to melt together all right we live as humans born in sin shap in iniquity have a carnal mind all right but we're trying to head toward the mind of Christ which is pure and holy and is godliness well if it's required then there's something we got to do that'll get us to that all right so we're going to see that here in just a few minutes so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you for this evening you've give us in the middle of the week pray that you'd be with us now and sanctify us Lord open us up Lord open our heart to you Lord that we'll hear from you father and Lord I pray there be any sick among us Lord that you'll heal them Father I know there's several that are at home that are sick Lord and several that are not with us sister Rebecca and sister Anna Lord different ones that's traveled to be with loved ones that are not that are not well father I pray that your healing hand would be upon them Lord touch us here now today Lord give us Revelation because that's what we thrive on that's what we live on just is the Mana that fell in the wilderness Lord let the Mana fall today father that we'll get something from you Lord and we'll be able to eat it and let it sustain us Lord till we meet again father just bless us now in Jesus name amen you can be seated so we've been talking about the um godliness and then we're going to head toward brotherly kindness but let's read the scripture here in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh that's what we're heading toward only in this end time as we were kind of trying to to uh show our brothers and sisters this past weekend that it's not just going to take it's not just going to take average reading it's not going to take average to get us out of here average will not get us out of here average sustained us through the church ages average will get you into heaven maybe maybe but exceptional is what we're required now we're required to live a Godly life that's what we're going to going to talk about here in just a minute and something kind of struck me yesterday no day before yesterday someone said it work and uh you know you you always you you never ever ever do you have a conversation with somebody about religion and they don't say well I ain't perfect you ain't perfect right cuz you start you start digging into that you know living a little bit higher life and they're like no no I you know I the Lord don't matter if it don't matter Lord if I say that bad word and I even asked I said would you say that in front of your pastor she said well if that's the only thing I say bad yes I probably would say it well okay all right so you see that's the mentality of the world mentality of the world is Satan has beat them down so much till there's no way to come to Perfection no way there's no way to get there your denomination has just got you sitting somewhere and you're what divided that's what denomination means it divides you up but we're going to be the word made flesh Jesus was not uh um I was watching the guy yesterday on YouTube his last name is Peters or Peterson and he's all crippled up with arthritis but man he went through that book of God's generals and he just berated every one of them said that all that charismatic movement was false all that was false and the Holy Ghost he had inside of him knew it was false I thought man come on I mean come on I mean what holy go we've got three or four different holy ghosts cuz the first thing he'd say he said oh they don't believe in the Trinity oh they don't he talked about William Brandon all he don't first thing he just doesn't believe in the Trinity and said we've excluded him called him a charlatan called him you know some of them he called they were just wanted money the different things but I thought man I would not be sitting where you're sitting no if I didn't understand it I just say I don't understand even to today we can say well we don't understand that but we've come to a place to where we have to understand we've got to come to it's a requirement that when we get our diploma to get out of here when we have our when we have our um deed in hand what do we have we have the title deed now back where it should be the title deed now you have eternal life but that's not all the title deed was your Earth the title deed was that your flesh was going to be made word and your word was going to be made flesh now is is the word Eternal absolutely the word of God is eternal man's words will fall man's words will go away there'll be Millions upon Millions upon millions of volumes of uh especially that guy that wrote you'll never know hear about that in glory you'll never hear about that you know you won't need a Webster's Dictionary but there's a time where you need all these things but then there'll be a time when they won't be you don't need that all right so second Peter 1 verse 5 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness that's what we're coming to Godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity and we told you the last time we spoke that when we get to that charity there is a gap in there there is something there there something takes place and we'll get into it maybe Sunday we'll get into that part of an interval because we're all humans I mean like today man I worked in the Garden today for for half a day I took the day off because of my they pulled some more teeth yesterday or they before yesterday and I be Lis and spit but I'll be all right but I worked in the garden all day and and went home and I was tired I was dragging the wagon was dragging but after about an hour of of coming in sitting down drinking some water uh June fixed some wonderful supper and Gary CR is not here but he gave us um uh meatballs and they were good so praise the Lord for that but I was rejuvenated then so there was an interval between me working hard there was an interval where I just took it easy kept eating I mean it was something I did it wasn't that I just sat there and didn't do anything and then now we're at church so that's the way we need to look at in the gospel there's there's seven Church ages and and it's like you know it's like Bam Bam Bam Bam like brother Brown said it talks about the uh the Roman Candle well there's going to be a time where there's going to be like a pause for everything to catch up and we better catch up or I'll promise you at that moment is when God's going to shut the door to the ark all right so don't get left behind 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy great is this mystery of godliness great is this mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached under the Gentiles believed on the world received up into the into Glory now what do we see we see that same man back down here we see him in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that we're going to see when it says holy spirit up here it's not that the First Holy Ghost is false it's just when we come to a as as Revelations 3:14 says the faithful and true witness he wasn't a false one he never was a false witness but we'll reading what brother Brown says about that he he explains true being like you tuneing Fork it's true it it sounds right everything's the way it's supposed to be and and as we were talking about godliness with contentment we come to that place where the struggle is about to be over folks without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God do manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit Sint of angels preach and the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory that great mystery without controversy if anything has a controversy there's a dispute there's a doctrinal issue now that you got the Methodist Church buddy they split now I mean they're splitting like crazy and they're they're abandoning churches and aband won't let people in certain churches and and uh that's not contentment but you and I got to learn to be content while that's going on we got to learn to be content while that's going on in the message ah so that means we got to move up we've got to be a little more scholarly all right so we know we talk we've been talking about the Plan of Redemption Romans 8:29 said for whom he did for no he also did predestinate so look simply one more time he saw this he saw that he would lay the plan out God himself f just just put the plan out it's not going to change or God changed so it's not going to change so as he threw it out brother B he threw it out with us in it not us coming to it I'm kind of quiet tonight he came he came with us with with remember we were in him so we were in the plan we were not something he thought of and then he thought of the plan as the plan unfolded as the Bible says we read it Sunday the Bible says in continuance was I fashioned in the lower parts of the Earth in other words in your mother's womb come on somebody that's where you were C curiously robed you were what you there was no way now when we grew up you could didn't even know the sex of the child till the baby came right you used to go to used to go to baby showers and there was a lot of yellow there for some of you you younger ones you're going what in the world no we didn't know the sex of the baby so it was either you got something pink or blue or they'd have to take it back so you got something yellow ain't that right Mom you got something yellow cuz yellow stood for both but that's that's then see now look as we progress in the end time you and I can see who the baby is what the baby's here for we go back the for knowledge of God he forew and he what he he planned according to what he already saw not what surprised them I believe the devil can't see so much by forign knowledge CU a lot of this stuff surprises him I believe that I just and so see that puts us in a position to where we we look at the Devil and we think well now if we look at the pecking order we thank God the devil or Lucifer cuz that's the way the creation part came when he said when he created Lucifer and then the genesis6 man folks that genesis6 man was already in eternity before Satan was made because you got to remember one thing Satan was not in eternity if he was he's an eternal being right so so he was not he had a beginning and he's going to have an ending you and I in that Genesis 126 man we did not have a beginning and we're not going to have an in if you can connect to that that's where you were before the foundation of the world and then the Bible tells us that we were curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth in other words your parents got together and and didn't have a clue what you'd look like didn't have a clue if you would grow up and be a preacher didn't have a clue if you'd grow up and be anything but that's not the way God works God knew as we grow up what are you saying brother way he know he know knows when we come up to a certain point we're growing we're growing and then we may have an issue we may have a problem in our life well he knew that already by for knowledge so he can predetermine something to help you thank God for that predetermine something to help you brother John once you get there it's that matching pieces there's a piece fell off in the Garden of Eden amen but remember it didn't get lost he didn't get annihilated brother Brown said I love what he said he said God just took the book back put it tucked his under his arm in other words I don't know if that's a direct quote but I believe God just took the book and he said okay I'm going to hang on to this cuz I'm a savior I'm a Healer I'm a redeemer and in this book I got people that I got to save cuz I already saw him I already saw him before the foundation of the world to be conformed to what the image of his son to be conformed to him that Genesis 1:26 man have never changed it never will change it can't change it won't be created in His image and then all of a sudden created in the devil's image or an image of a dog or a cat no it was already created in God's image the real you the Genesis 126 man the one that's supposed to be that Holy Ghost as that brother said that Holy Ghost that leads you and guides you into all truth I believe that right amen and I don't believe see he he's looking at it as a third person of Trinity I'm looking at it as God himself the throne man in other words not getting down to a secretary and getting down to a treasur and getting down to this and get no God had his hand in all this he has a title though he goes by those titles and he we were made in the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover moreover whom he he did what predestinate he called all right he saw it saw what we would come to saw as this thing unfolding that that that Boyd would be here in 2023 and and you know brother how would be where he's at in a situation of all those everybody's situation never ever slipped up on God so now if he sees it though brother Aaron if he sees it he looks into our Humanity CU we're not infinite yet we are finite trying to look at an infinite God but God's infinite looking at us going I knew you were going to get into that situation here's something to help you if you'll take it that's where that's where I see a plan that's where I see that you do have a choice it's the choice you make and God you've already made that choice you just don't know it that's why I love that scripture the Bible says All Things Are to be made new we're not have to we won't listen to the disappointments the trials that brother Hal went through the trials that all of us have went through in our life that's what bombards our brain now right right not anymore because we're going to go back to that Genesis 126 thinking to where that didn't happen that's what we got to look at folks this is not so this is not the way it should have happened this is not the way God wanted to see it but to be God and a free and to give you free moral agency he had to let you do what you doen cuz listen you never can take away his judgeship he is a righteous judge he's not just a judge I was thinking about it today you know if you look in the paper or you look um you look on online and you see the that there was um a judge that that that sent us somebody to to prison and he wasn't guilty that's not a righteous judge now I'm sure he was going by whatever they gave him but somebody lied in there somewhere somebody told a lie to get to that point but with God being the judge he can't lie praise the Lord he can't lie so his judgment can't be changed and it's always going to be true so moreover whom he did predestinate let he also called whom he called he Justified as I say before this weekend try to help the people see that we are special that we know we did something wrong we know we got in the pawn shot we know we got into in front of the judge we know we did something wrong we know that but that's what Grace is for but Grace is when you walk into the courtroom I know some of you may have I've been in it one time in my life so I don't know but some of y'all may have been in it more I don't like them frequent flyer miles in the judge I don't want to know the judge by name unless he's a friend of mine okay I don't want to know Josh knew all them yeah Josh knew well he's throwing it away now but Josh knew everybody up there when you frequent a place you get to know the people but you done something wrong and you you feel unjust everybody with me this is where we're going to head toward glorification you you feel unjust you feel dirty you know you did it you made a boo boo all right but you walk into this court and there sits the man you know as Jesus Christ sitting as a judge with his white wig on H you look over and that same man standing over here the prosecutor right and that same man is set standing over here the defense attorney and you look on the judge and you see 12 people and they all Jesus Christ how would that make you feel that make you feel wonderful but you know why cuz he knew we'd make a mistake he knew we would do wrong and he's going to justify us and glorify us not by his own will but he knew what we would do when we walked into that uh courtroom we wouldn't be arrogant we wouldn't be well bless God I you know I got all this I know all these people so I'm no you come in with wanting some Grace you come in wanting I want Justice amen man there's so much Injustice in this world I want justice so they so I can go now into the Bible and look at me being uh as we're going to talk in a minute about life and godliness even in our life we can live a righteous life cuz we know how everybody with me I know it's Wednesday night don't fall asleep come on SO brother R tells us that you're on the basis of free moral agency you can turn this down you can't accept it you know what you can do you walk into that courtroom you know you did it but the the jurors look at the prosecutor prosecutor looks at the defense attorney defense attorney looks at the judge and said we don't have no Witnesses wouldn't that make you feel good even though you knew you did it but you walk in the door and you don't say a word and they're all going I didn't see it they wouldn't call witness call witness nobody comes to the door right that's the way it is with our sins and whatever we do our life we got to understand that when we walk into that room we're already forgiven and not just forgiven they don't know you did itl cuz you're going yeah yeah yeah no I where's witness ain't that what Jesus said to the woman they threw her down and said hey she was caught in the act of adultery in other words he said did y'all see it I didn't see it they said oh yeah we saw we saw it well about 2 minutes later they were gone somewhere else there was some condemnation inside of them that sent them somewhere else and believe you me it must have been something with more condemnation than they wanted that girl killed cuz the law said Stone her cuz they watched her commit adultery but what dides Jesus done he got rid of their accusers he got rid of all the witnesses and he says I don't see it I didn't see it go on he said go on and send no more don't do that again now same way with us don't do that again cuz we're going to look at godliness where godliness is not you just keep doing the same thing over and over again we got to get rid of that stuff every once in a while don't you remember when you first got saved all that stuff you got over that you got over kicked out moved out shoved out kicked out didn't want no more it didn't even feel good to be where you thought you was before that's the step of godliness that's the step of godliness because look it wasn't godliness that got you in that place where you was at it was the devil that got you in the place where you was at brother R said you can turn this down or you can accept it to turn it down is to be lost and remain potach calcium petroleum but to accept it and have a new heart a new spirit in his Spirit part of the logos in you controlling your emotions controlling your emotions that's right sometimes we have we want uncontrolled emotions we want the shouting and the speaking in tongues and running the aisles and all that that's good fine and dandy but where's the new heart and the new spirit where's his spirit where's part of the logos at and you controlling your emotions and when he CS through his word you coup back and answer to him that's why you should say Amen when the preacher's preaching cuz you're agreeing with the if the Loos is inside of you you're agreeing cuz it's pulling it's bringing those two together you might you might not know somebody from nobody but he comes up here and preaches a wonderful sermon and you connect with that brother with well you don't know him you havin known him a day right so what is it then it's what's inside of you is what connects now you're going to have to make a choice Jesus said let every word man word be a lie mine be truth now you got to make up your mind now watch that where it says let every man's word be a lie and mine be trth every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth now you got to make up your mind you got to make a choice and this may be your last time to make a choice tomorrow may be too late God might have chose you to eternal life now this is to me this is an outstanding quote this just takes away the pulling through the tube and M God's going to make you saved and he made you saved from the foundation of the world well God might have chose you to eternal life but but if you don't make up your mind those pieces have got a match now God saw a match or he saw him not but it was because what you chose but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place in other words what's going to happen God's going to keep moving on cuz somebody's going to want it he saw somebody want it so he's going to move on further just like me and you there's more to this message than just brother Brown was a prophet there's more to this message even that we get the Holy Ghost and just start living right Philippians 2:15 says that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God look without rebuke well let me tell you something that's not talking about your regular life cuz you get rebuked all the time why do you women do this why do you women not cut you have why do you women not do this why do you men not do this what do you mean you you don't you don't you don't say a little bad word every once in a while I'm telling you that's what we're fixing the seed that's what's going to separate us and put us into where where the the Bible tells us life and godliness and it's in second Peter when we've been talking about the Statue of perfect man it puts us into that I mean listen did you walk in here today and just totally believe you were blameless of everything You' done no I'll go and answer that for you number one if You' have said yes you'd have been lying and that took you blameless part out amen we come to church to get rid of those things right but if we do it the right way come on somebody we do it the right way we've been told how to do it we know we should know how to do it if we do that that makes us blameless that doesn't have to watch your saying rehash or reup or bring something back up that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke look in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation in other words God did not take us and put us on an island and say hey bride you live right here because y'all are special people how easy would that be if everything we done revolved around the Bible the church and the message wow well that's what we're going to live in that's what we're heading toward but not now God put us in the midst of a crooked and a perverse Nation put us in the most perverse Church age among whom you shine as light in the world Genesis 171 say when AB AB was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou Perfect all right let's get into this just for a minute that word perfect means one who lacks nothing now look they talk about in physical strength and beauty they're sound wholesome complete morally innocent that's a hard one to swallow having Integrity one who is morally and ethically pure now let's talk about that in just a minute stop right here that word perfecting because the Bible talks about how we're going to get perfected the perfecting of the Saints is going to be given to us by the ministry of the Gospel of Jesus Christ all right somebody getting up behind this pull pit and ministering to you are there are brother Bob of the different ones asking questions helping people that's just the way this economy works and we can't do it no different you know why cuz it won't work you know why God wanted it done that way he saw it would work he saw there'd be a division of people that wouldn't want it over here right but he saw there be group of people that would consistently listen to pastors prophets teachers evangelist and get Perfection from that not Perfection from this over here right cuz remember there's a Godly and an ungodly there's godliness and there's ungodliness all that live Godly in Christ will what suffer persecution listen it's not so much they hate you they hate that Spirit that's inside of you because it's different from what like just for example I was telling you about work and one girl she just spit off a couple of good ones and she goes to the Baptist church with me and June was married in she's a good girl but Lord she let it go one day and I just looked at her and I said I just I H you know just kind of It kind of floored me a little bit she said well if that's the only that you know in other words if that's the worst thing I've ever said and that's why I said it I said would you say that in front of your preacher she said well if that's the worst thing he ever heard from me that'd be all right so you know you start backing up and smoothing all that over you know I made a mistake you perfect that's the same thing she said she looked at me and she said you've never said nothing like that I said not in 20 something years after the Lord save my soul he did not I have not they don't understand that though cuz they're they're seemingly righteous holy they're seemingly different than the world out there that just throws F bombs and all this all every every breath they got right but they're just not seeing that they're the same as that they still got that same Spirit The Same Spirit that they had then what happened Satan has just coed it over with religion he's just coded all this over with religion oh it's okay oh it's okay for your sisters to wear pants to church it's okay it's okay for you you men to you know have a little social drink every once in a while or or you know if you real thirsty get you get you cold one I got one today Diet Mountain Dew I know that's hard for some but it's good I like down Mountain dud so what's the difference what's the difference in me working out in the yard and drinking water or or or thinking I'm going to get a night mount do then for then for you know not our neighbor but just say neighbor does the same thing well he goes home and either he's got a six-pack or he goes and gets one you understand what I'm saying so life and godliness has got to work together it can't work separate you can't have one one one uh you can't have I almost said her name you can't have the girl at work you know saying a few this and that and the others and then she moves over here and she says well you're not perfect and and don't tell me you don't say them things listen they they will they'll call you a liar they'll call you a liar she almost did I said I'm never in 20 something years since I've been saved no uhuh and then they're like oh come on are you secret sinner that's just like job's accusers that's your right they got a bunch of there around you and like you really do you kind of having a rough time you may I bet you slipped up on one there a couple days ago didn't you no you just had life so let's talk about this just for a minute is everybody all right godliness is reverence all right respect pety towards God and I'm going to say one thing else piety toward each other respect toward each other amen respect for elders have went out the Doorly respect for parents has went out the door respect for anything the Bible tells us if you're even a slave hello somebody treat your boss right that's right I'm sorry treat your owner right well that's even worse treat your owner right right H so let's talk a minute about life and godliness that's okay and without controversy great is this mystery of godliness you know why it's a mystery because people can't without the Holy Ghost they can't live it amen without the Holy Ghost because God was manifested in the flesh your flesh amen that's why like I said before you've got this group over here that just don't care right Cur like Sailors then you got that group in between that slip up on one every once in a while now I want to ask you something slipping up on one shouldn't be now listen slipping up on one in your justification yes sir yes ma'am come on brother Brown said that unclean spirit is still in ins side of you at justification making you do what you did before it's just that everything you had done before has been chopped off that's why we're looking at the higher form of justification and I'm going to do a sermon on that the the um higher form of justification because when we get in here and we get when we get to the to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we start living this godliness and we start seeing that that we can live it listen I've come to a conclusion I can live this now you may not the altar is open get that thing off you or out of you I've come to the conclusion this is it sure I make mistakes you know what when she said what she did I thought the same thing in my head well now get quiet on me but we didn't entertain it like we used to entertain it you let that bird just fly right on by see that see brother John when we see that we're like thank you Lord thank you Lord we've been taught to know that that's not condemning me even though it did come in here sir even though it did but what did he do it didn't reside there it just moved on through cuz we have a carnal mind we have to deal with but you and I are going to have to hearing godliness we got to separate that thing we make mistakes we are not p r f c as the world sees perfect never make a wrong move everything at work goes exactly 100% every time cuz perfect is every time see that's what they're looking at that's why while they say I'm not perfect you think you're perfect I'm not perfect you're not perfect they're looking at the humanity part but when it comes down to situations of life and godliness as we're going to see in just a minute there is life that we have to live life listen us coming here us coming here into this world is contrary to God and is not so it's not the way it should have been everybody with me the Eternal part of God's mind can't change that's what we're getting to we come down here curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth my substance was hid from thee what me my [Music] Humanity but what happened at a new birth that's why it's called a new birth we had a chance come on we had a chance to be born right we had a chance to be born the way we should have been that's your new birth not just that I'm going to get the Holy Ghost just going to clean this out and I'm going to just no it brings you to a realization that you have to Paul I preached about 25 sermons on it do you remember that Paul said the life I now live which many lived another one before the life I now live I live by the faith of Jesus Christ you and I did not live our first life according to Jesus Christ well you can agree with it or not I'm going to tell you you did but we've got to as bride we've got to do you know you see the you see the the story of the Three Sisters and and the armor meat packing boy and and you know you look at brother brandham and and you look at this way you see you know there was a party house was full of people bunch of girls bunch of bride potential bride was in that room in that house my mind the three sisters we know were there right so they're putting on their danties and they're you know they're trying to impress the guy well the real bride wasn't even in that house she wasn't even in the house she wasn't dressed like the world she wasn't acting like them I'm sure them three women looking at this now look let's put the scenario here you've got a an armor meat packing guy that I'm sure at that time he wasn't worth billions of dollars like they are now but very wealthy cuz they made hot dogs and all that stuff eventually armor if you don't know Armory is a hot dog okay it's not an osar winner cuz you couldn't sing a wish you were an osar anyway so you know those three girls did everything in their power that they thought now come on people they thought they could get to him CU you know what they were looking at they weren't looking at his love they were looking at his money and his status and his you know he's up here we're down here yeah the wash the wash woman as brother R said the the fourth girl I like that number four when it comes to humans that fourth she probably didn't even know who he was but she heard his what she heard his voice she probably heard all that going on and then the armor meet packing guy like God does sometimes he said I'm disgusted I I don't even want to be in that room with them people I'm going to go find me somebody that I can talk to and he talked to her great is a mystery of godliness she was trying her best to live a Godly life because she had separated herself from the world are from that going on inside everybody with me all right so denominations let's look this real quick then we'll probably we'll just close here cuz we we can finish it Sunday won't be too long you look at life and godliness all right so without controversy great is the mystery of godliness now it is a mystery until now the prophet of God says the mystery's now been made known or the mystery is now history so we have the book open to tell us how to live Godly all right now look this just comes up in in our communion when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord chasen means instructed for 60 years now since the prophet's gone we have been instructed sometimes by different we have been destructed by some but we have been instructed by a a group of ministers that's brought everybody brought us to a place not just us but there's there's Ministry around the world that's brought a PE brought people that have instructed the people are they been chastened of the Lord look that we should not be condemned with the world Amen all right so the world is condemned why let's just throw the blanket out and let's I mean we know one thing for sure we know that they're condemned because they don't have the new birth all right so let's just get that out of the way but let's go over a few few things and let's see how that we can live Godly in Christ how that we can live a life that's close to him everybody with me number one we don't have a horse forehead think about it we are not a denomination we don't believe in denominations so we have been separated from that group of the and her harlots all right is everybody with me so that's just one I'm not going to put them one two three but that's that's one way that we can live Godly in Christ we don't have a a moniker on our denomination B where do you go church I'm Baptist remember what brother R said to that woman said are you a Christian I'm Methodist that's hard to say now but we don't have that title I hope you don't say we're message Believers and that's the reason we born again no we're born again cuz we know how how we know how to get born again we know how to get we know how it feels to be justified come on somebody we know how it feels to be Sanctified if you don't please please don't sleep until you realize that God has cleaned You Up made you different listen give you something to make you different by oh listen but people have took it to the extreme brother Donnie they have calls and they have these you you got to be with our group you know I'm hurting my sheep over here now it's the goat that's hurting the Sheep that's a denomination just wrapped up in a message church so we don't have the horse forehead we don't have the condemnation that that horse system is going to receive remember I just read you that we should not be condemned with the world why is the world going to be condemned because they didn't believe but there is going to be a Catholic church or whatever you want to call it a denomination that God hates now you can't live Godly and him hat you everybody with me on this we're trying I'm trying to pile this thing up where it's not so such a great big mountain but we do have to pile it up and get it together that's right right and I always wondered why brother brandham was talk about a woman cutting her hair the Bible says it's an Abomination how can you live Godly and be an Abomination can't so see that's another separation Point brother Brown said one time you know he said God w't him hear the prayer of a bobhair woman right amen only for her salvation you look at people like Joyce Myers her hair is shorter than mine amen and she's just people walking across a platform and just you know getting healed and and supposedly getting the Holy Ghost I ain't going to say they can't but but yeah exactly she kind of ugly but they but listen they've attached theirself to Godliness Geor Myers don't get up I hope she doesn't see that Geor smes don't get up in the morning and say I'm just as false as I can be I'm going to go out here and deceive a couple hundred thousand people today I'm going to go out here and teach them something false no she gets something studies just like I do amen y'all do she gets up she goes to church like some of y'all don't but she's so deceived though she still got tithes to the world everybody with me we're trying to untie this thing cuz the Bible tells us life and godliness and that we should not be condemned with the world right now we can just say and go home and say well we have the new birth according to Malachi 4 according to Luke 17:30 we have the new birth we've been Justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost we can go home let's think about just a minute right back sitting right back there I thought Lord why why do this what a struggle we already got eternal life in our soul we just go home and sit down have you ever not thought about that some of you do cuz you do it but really I mean if we got the Holy Ghost Bob come on if we got the Holy Ghost why don't you have to preach two sermons Sunday why you have to practic your music for really I mean come on we got the Holy Ghost we can't not have it if we get it right but if you got it you want more the problem is people think they got it and think I'm done this is it now you just starting but the denomination we have no horse forehead we have no horse thinking we're trying to get what the mind of Christ so you can't have the mind of Christ and have a horse forehead everybody with me on that remember okay I don't want to say that too many times but hair you sisters if you don't cut your hair guess what you will not be condemned with the world cuz 99.99% of this world ladies thinks it's okay to cut your hair is that not right am I am I pretty close to 99 can I just say 99% just to give 1% of the whole world I talk about the world the world is just it's okay to to do that and see nothing wrong with wearing pants right when the Bible says it's an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment pertaining to man the world has attached their to that we haven't unless you slip around and put some on and then you're still in the world come on somebody all right so now we're trying not to be condemned with the world we're trying to be chased and or Ted what did Brother Brown tell us he say Malachi 4 was sent to tie up Loose Ends what are loose ends oh it's okay oh it's okay you just trim a little I mean just you know do like some people do and I've seen it here at the church same way you don't cut it this way or it's obvious but if you cut it this way ah right don't you think we don't see what's going on Amen but listen God knows for we did so don't fool him you're not going to fool him we we're not going to be we're going to be condemned with the World by not doing what God Said so we're trying our best to what not be condemned with the world and then that leads us to Godliness not sinless Perfection right that's what that guy that Peter's guy he said oh all the all the uh everything they say is two things in the charismatic movement that that us everybody's an Elijah course he was referring to brother brand and different people and everybody thinks that they have sinless Perfection and you get a lot of money because of that he just a he's just blinded the bat what his problem is he's blinded by the what the God of this evil age right he's blinded by ungodliness everybody with me just a second our actions our dress separates us from the world our manner of life as I was saying before for you won't you don't see I you know I do I want to say this you you take a denomination like the church there in in town in Gillsville or any other church and and you know that it's nothing to them to smoke a little cigarette or take a little drink or say a little bad word just like the girl did there's no teaching for that it's all okay cuz we're not perfected we're not perfect we can't be Godly when the Bible tells us I've got 10 more scriptures that says be Godly to our mannerisms of life you take churches take this church I'm going reach your hand out like this pay me some money no reach your hand out like this and do this right here pat yourself on the back cuz cuz y'all are not any of you in a divorce case none of you are in a domestic violence case none of you have U been put in jail for DUI am I I hope I'm not hitting somebody here turn the camera off alter but see we look at it and we think there's no way we can do this but Donnie just to look at these people I'm serious look look at these people y'all live cleaner than anybody on the face of this Earth You live more Godly than anybody on the face of the Earth that's what God's looking for cuz remember he's looking for a separated people he's not looking for a perfect people he's looking for a separated people that becomes as this list is showing us that we're not being condemned with the world Amen we don't need bless your heart you get these big churches and they have they have a you know they have a a Ministry for divorce people they have a Ministry for single people that are divorced that are looking to get married again let's try that out every once in a while no we don't ever do that that's not in our curriculum everybody with me you understand what I'm saying you sitting here today you live more Godly than anybody on the face of the Earth and but you go I well I I just I got mad what I drove somebody off the road you better not do that but some of you thought about it though huh listen some of y'all are not behind bar right 99.9 I hope not I had to go get out of jail yet why cuz you try to live the law here through the law of life and godliness the law you see on your book keeps you away from the law man had you know why a man had right a law somebody broke it you know why you look you look at these lawnmowers you look down at the deck of the lawnmower and it's got a guy with his fingers whacked off says do not put your hand in this hole do you know why they put that sticker there somebody put their hand in that hole and it tore their fingers off right that's what a Law's for a law for DUI Law I remember when we used to when we were growing up they w a law they want to De you on law I mean you just they just take you home you know what they do they take you home I don't know that personally but I've heard praise the Lord but but you see how we develop now though we don't have to worry about that we don't have to have an alcoholics anonymous group to meet in church are y'all getting what I'm saying count that stuff off count that part that you don't have to deal with you don't have to go home and deal with if my wife's going to divorce me or not no you're going to work your problems out out through God and godly people everybody with me that we be not condemned with the world we're being instructed by the Holy Ghost right second Peter 13 says according as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness now that's part of Statute of perfect man through the knowledge of him look for through the knowledge of him who's him not me not brother Dale not to other ministers through the Lord Jesus in a Ministry amen everybody with me in a Ministry that ministers to us I mean listen come on we go through hard times as as parents as as um husband and wife um let's get away from in-laws but we'll talk about that later when there's not so many people here maybe two or three but even with that I mean we joke and cut up but we love we love the people that were around you might not like to be around them all the time but there's a love that wants to see them see what you see is that not you is that not you I don't want to force something on them I don't want to make them do something I want to just see God and start acting like it that's right I I was looking the other day that you look through and you see um take psychologist for example they're psychologist for everything now right for your pets right figure that one out and call me in the morning for your pet right hold on for you and your pths didn't brother B say this world was going insane it's here it's here it's here I mean all this stuff that goes on you you look at all this gun violence and everything going on we don't have to worry about that if you're born again filled with the Holy Ghost you come to church and you do your job and your duty you're not thinking about shooting up a school come on you're not that's not even in your thought process but I promise you it's in some of their thought process cuz they're doing it every day you know we don't hear about it we don't collectively put it together but after that one shooting in in um Louisville there was aund Louisville sorry not Louisville Louisville there was 163 mass shootings prior to that from January to that day right 163 mass shootings which is two or more people getting killed this weekend Chicago 43 people shot nine dead in one weekend because it's Memorial Day and everybody's all hyped up but Memorial Day is to what pay homage to the people that died well some of them decided to go ahead and be part of that that people but you and I we don't look at that day as anything different am I getting somewhere we just think that you know Satan just beats us up about stuff little stuff but godliness as we'll look in just a minute maybe no we're not godliness with contentment with contentment listen you know what love is you know what real love is is contentment I love my wife and I am content with her just in filo love cuz I'm content I don't have to go in and and have a gun battle with her she'd lose cuz she wouldn't want to shoot nobody she just is that way but that is the thought process in the world though domestic violence is just rampant what is that that's a husband and a wife that's two people that's supposed to be so in love with each other they can't do without each other come on somebody yet there's laws now because of all this that all you got to do is pick the phone up and say hey my husband smacked me upside the head well he goes to jail for 48 hours there ain't no attorney you don't you don't pass go you definitely don't collect $200 right that's why they made it so serious to separate I hope you ever get to never get to that point work on your issues June and I have been married 44 years yeah we still surprise each other she said amen but we there's no thought there's not a thought process is in my mind of getting rid of her come on people but this world is full of people that would love to get rid of their spouse you see that woman the other day she's some kind of advocate and she's some kind of they love her and she's some kind of oh you know angel and a guru they got her for poisoning her husband slowly killed him while she was doing Oprah Winfrey and all these other places telling everybody how great everything was she's in jail now cuz she was she didn't like her husband you see how the mentality of people are but would that enter please don't answer this question would that enter your mind is look over and say I just like to get rid I just like to get rid of her or him you know why we're not cuz we're separated we're separated from that now the old me what would have stopped it the old you what would have stopped it come on somebody it wouldn't have you're going to do what you are inside but now that we have that Advocate we have all the different things inside of us that takes us to this right here then let's stand our feet we'll come to a close right here whereby are giving un us exceeding great and precious promises listen we lean on those promises the world has no promise tell me that it does no none ask them ask a non-Christian say what do you think we're going to do here in about another 6 months or a year you know they're getting ready in July to change the uh change of currency not go completely by the dollar anymore well hello somebody we already read that news 50 years ago we got prophesied that so we shouldn't be going really like Terence said one time if we' have just really listened to what brother Brown said we'd have all bought gold a long time ago I mean really if it's going to go to some astronomical amount of money and then the Pope's going to that's the only way you're going to be able to buy or sale and the Pope's going to you know reimburse you for that we should have bought much gold but that's not going to get us out of here Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you rise up and walk that by these you might be partakers what these promises that I was telling you that's why the prophet of God had to come that's why zerubabel had to rebuild that house he had to rebuild that Temple and what Temple was he rebuilding Jefferson Tabernacle brother Bram brand Tabernacle no he's rebuilding you he's rebuilding me shable work on me not that world out there work on me having escaped look having escaped that's good enough for me having escaped the corruption that is in this world through lust that's a promise but look though verse five we'll stop right there come on musicians and besides this what we thought this whole sermon was the I mean we're up at the Capstone now we just getting started yeah Faith virtue and all his Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness it is not the headstone it brings The Headstone on but it's not the headstone besides this this giving all diligence add add we'll talk about a deity this weekend because you and I are deity if you have the Holy Ghost and deity doesn't make a mistake deity doesn't go backwards deity is not held accountable to mistake Jesus he made all kind of mistakes oh yeah he he he learned by the things he suffered he was a human we learn by the things we suffer I mean you should love your even even at at Mom and Dad's age at 60 something years being married mom be 81 uh Monday you should still be bindings closer together did we not get did we get married to Jesus Christ when we got the new birth did we not yeah and we hate him more now than we did then sir we don't like him now we liked him then but we don't like him now no love him more sure there's things we have to deal with in life absolutely but don't let them overrule your Christianity live what you preach amen all of us amen and listen I can start a list over here where we all failed but not from the Bible not from this deity part that we're talking about not from this godliness if the Bible tells us to be Godly or have godliness there's got to be a door for us to get into that there's godliness right here but it's shut off it's shut off and we can't get to it you know who shut it off Satan shut it off first church age Jesus or Jesus but the the Holy Ghost Jesus standing there though right in the the church ages he said you've lost your first love right just what I said you've married me now you don't like me no more come on kids you better put that in your cap you love a guy and you give your heart to him he's yours for life and you better believe that don't make him out to be a liar I ha a lot of lies goes WR during the wedding ceremony but they but in the world though stati statistics tells us 50% of people divorc in the first five years statistics so it must be right as bride is that what we're looking at I'm going to I'm going to love him till he don't get but when he gets sick or or when we have to live in a trailer we started out living in a in a nice little like 1,800 square foot house which cost you $400,000 now but um me and June started out in the trailer and Mom and Daddy we had to scrub the thing we actually literally open the doors mama she'll tell you I ain't lying and I ain't exaggerating we scraped stuff off the floor opened all the doors took a water hose and scrubbed that trailer out before we me and June could live in it but guess what it must have been all right okay must have been all right we live in a pretty good house now so we're okay we're good you know why cuz we progressed in love but I'll promise you one thing if I ever had to go back and live in that again I would I'd live it with her that's right don't don't open I would I'd live it with her I'm not going to live with nobody else cuz we've been through it that's right same way with your Christianity we are being going through it and being gone through it in all of our Christian Journey every little thing that we do and we can't we're not going and God we're not going to go back to living in a trailer we're going to we're going to a mansion amen that's already prepared and it's not prepared on his idea it's prepared on your idea it's built for you and me that's how much he loves us that's how much he knows we can do this we can and will overcome I'll promise you the Bible tells us he that overcometh amen just give him some time to work give God time to work with your Humanity if you're having problems I know we all do but when I'm talking about this when when God requires us to be Godly he's got to make a way and I just told you the way to do it and you're doing it already you just don't realize it if you're living Godly if you're living pure no drinking no smoking no no no all that hey half the battle's over you're living Godly so all that live Godly in Christ though what shall suffer persecution let's sing song Anybody have a [Music] name go down in that City well the sun it will never go down the flowers are blooming forever and the Sun will never go down I feel like this is a long journey folks it's been a long journey but there's an end to this down here we're toward something else forever and the Sun is will never go down I feel like sh sometimes I do I feel like child I do the flowers are blooming forever and the sun it will never never go [Music] down the sun will never in that City oh the sun [Music] it and the sun it will never [Music] hang on a minute go ahead brother um I'm going ask the church to be in prayer tomorrow morning at 9:00 Wade and I hadn't talked at all about this but Jan and I are going to be in court about uh an eviction that we're we've got a a person that's been with us probably 15 16 years he's almost like family and he moved into one of our homes uh two years ago he was homeless and I gave him a place to live and all I asked him for was 40 hours work a month that's all I asked him for he since uh hasn't helped us since October when we needed to help most and uh I've been patient my Temperance have kept it all in check so I told him I was going to have to evict him and he said no you won't do that to me and I said I'm sorry but it's business it's just life hope it's a life lesson for him and he'll turn his life around but the bottom line is we have two situations happening here and uh one of the homes one of the other homes we have is halfway on one of the cousins family uh property so I've got to move a home in the next couple months or quicker if they did really change challenges and that's family challenging us so there's just a couple things going on on top of everything else it's a want to be in prayer about but the main thing is what's what's hurtful about this whole thing is this guy I'm not asking for much just come weed we barter all the time somebody getting a tight come clean my house come wash my car I'll barter with you I'll give you the farm and that's typically what I've done with this fellow but just be in prayer because I know he's not going to have the right attitude and he thinks going tomorrow is going to save him because I've already given his first notice and official notice and Hall County served him he thinks he's going to get around it but it's he's just going to have 10 days is all he's going to have but he was living in a hole in the ground when I took him in he dug a hole and lived there on some pe people's property he burned trash and leaves around their home and burn it down he was and since then he's been got married so it's a mess but I hurt because I know he's not going to be able to help himself but I've done all we can we've done all we're willing to do we are we got the bill for pops monthly addition is $7,300 a month I need that place for income and I'm going to lose one in two months for income so it's kind of a tradeoff not gaining anything but certainly it's just a bad situation but be in prayer cuz I like the guy I would help him still Happ but I want to tell you I'm not the same P person I used to be because I wouldn't have that temper be able to handle the temperance and patience of this no there's days that we've been in fist fights and years ago when we got into this years ago but you know I've learned to be patient with people and just try to give them yeah love it just have the right attitude just love them right you know but just be in prayer at 9:00 you would okay um you know the Bible is pretty specific about taking somebody to court it doesn't say take don't take anybody to court it just says don't take a brother to court I don't think they're dealing with a brother here um so uh you have to use the law because you know what if that guy though was a member of the church or he was or he was a good Christian guy who wouldn't be dealing with this okay but then you got to deal with it though if you deal with the public you got to deal with those kind of people and don't let them run over you I mean I mean don't and I know Jesus said if you he wants your coat or your cloak give him your coat too you can go as far as you need to but but but right's right wrong is wrong you let the you let the the authorities deal with that and and U if you'll show a good attitude then that that guy will uh it never has been a good attitude to change your attitude when you get an attitude with somebody else's attitude I never will be able to say that again but do you understand what I'm saying if you have the same attitude they do you're going to get the same results with them right but if you'll have a different attitude they won't know how to handle it and 90% of the time they they'll back off cuz they don't know how to hand they want a confrontation the devil wants a confrontation with us but I thought the says resist the devil he didn't say fight him he didn't say argue with him that's resist him amen just walk off walk away get away from it so we'll be praying for that and situations we have to go through let's bow our head heavenly father thank you for this evening Lord I pray that something's been said Lord that'll help us in life when we go home tomorrow and get up in the morning the world smacks Us in the face Lord we'll take it with a grain of salt and continue on knowing that this is not our home we're looking for a mansion that you've already built according to our desires very soon Lord very soon Lord thank you for the brothers and sisters that's assembled today and the ones that that attend this church Lord I pray that you'd bless them Lord take care of them Lord raise them up Lord in the statue of a perfect man Lord as we continue with this this study Lord that maybe it would it would change our thoughts a little bit about about being so weary and tired and and and and seemingly insurmountable odds but Lord you're a God that takes those insurmountable odds and makes them surmountable one man thousand people one man with an ox go 600 people 600 trained Soldiers with the power
