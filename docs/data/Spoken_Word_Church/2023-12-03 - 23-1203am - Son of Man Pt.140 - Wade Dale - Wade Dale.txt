heart amen God bless you be seated amen you know I'd like to um challenge each of you this morning to when we when we do Bible reading pick a verse that you hear something that that just speaks to your heart and hold on to that through the through the service you know that's how you take the promises of God and say hey I I can identify with that thou are my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt uh Compass me about with a song of Deliverance there's something about singing you know when you get in a place in your life and uh you just lift your hands and start praising him it changes the atmosphere you know start quoting his word Tak him out his word like brother Ryan said I don't know about you that's set the atmosphere for today's service what he spoke I tell you it it really came down to where we live and it just takes flicking that devil off putting that shoulder down saying God I'm going to choose to read your word pray through and I really appreciate that Ryan um we want to say God bless you brother Dy we've been praying for the family and uh for the loss of your daughter we love you and um you're grieving and loss is ours as well so we just keep praying if anything we can do we're here for you so Amen Brother John would you come this morning and take up the TI and offering precious Lord we thank you so much father we can gather once again in Your Name Lord just thank you Lord for being in our midst Lord Jesus we pray Lord truly we just turn our hearts to see you Lord God in everything Lord the smallest things to the greatest things Lord help our eyes to be fixed on you bless the service Lord Jesus we pray bless our brother Lord Your Vessel this morning yield to you bring exactly what we need we love you father we pray you bless the ties and the offerings Lord part of the remaining ofice we love you we lift you up father strength Lord Jesus amen amen Let's uh let's sing that song fill my way every day with love amen we want more of God's love in our life and you know I thinking um when brother Ron was U that Sunday school Sermon Just sister Anna listening to that sermon is just as what of the chances of you listening to that sermon the same one that he has in his quotes there's such a confirmation a witness of the spirit there I want to share something I don't want to take up too much time I know this is a song service um last week Thanksgiving week we were all for a couple of days and uh you know sometimes you just need God to tell you I love you and you can read it in the scripture you can hear it a lot of times um through the sermons but when it's personal to you you look for that that thing that Supernatural way that it's impossible it just couldn't happen you just didn't pick up the this and so um I had a flat tire I had to go get a flat tire fix who wants a flat tire on Thanksgiving race so Friday I go get the flat tire fixed I need a oil change I go over to Walmart and get a oil change I had to wait walked around the store looking in the hunting section here comes a a man on a handicap cart one of those assist cars and he asked me a question about a gun and I said well it's about this and here's the BBS thank you sir you know bless you God bless you and we just went our ways I went back to the old change station cuz they were finished with the truck and he comes through the door and he's walking on his um um his uh crutches and he's missing a leg the same man he said we meet again and so I started to talk to him about Thanksgiving he started to talk to me about how good God is to him and things I'm waiting in line to pay for my own oil change and the Lord said pay for his and I said okay so I discreetly go up there and I try to pay for it and they said well it's going to take 2 hours cuz you can't pay for it until his car's done I said well I'll go get cash so I go get cash in the front I come back to the oil chain station he's gone he said well he went on his little cart into the store I walked around Walmart 45 minutes to try to find him and when I found him I told him I said the Lord just put it on my heart to pay for your oil chains here's some extra money for things given in your presence and stuff and he just opened up and I heard his story of how he lost his leg the hardships he was going through I took a picture of him he's on my prayer list and his name is Mike and and afterwards we uh he gave me his phone number I gave him my name I said you pray for me I pray for you and when I was walking away I got in my truck that song on my heart was I love him I love him because he first loved me and you need God to hear you say that so I get him my truck and I'm going to the next stop a store and I turn on my phone and some of you might have the lifeline app from voice of God I click on the sermon and it's a random sermon that just plays that's constantly playing and it was the bomb and gilean and it started at the end of the sermon when brother brandham and the whole congregation was singing I love him I love him cuz he first loved me what are the chances what are the chances just like this morning you had you were listening to that same sermon that he had in his nose what are the chances that God put a song on my heart out of 1400 messages I click on it and at that exact same place they're singing the same song a song of Deliverance right and then I realized God gave me a flat tire so I could go to town get it fixed meet a man pay his oil change so he can put a song in my heart so I got in my truck clicked on a sermon and it was the same song that was singing God gave me a flat tire to tell me he loves me the next time God gives you a flat tire or something look for him in that look for the testimony on that because he does things in such a supernatural way he speaks and don't we love him for that amen oh let me walk blessed Lord thou Hast gone leading straight to the land above giving cheer everywhere to the sad and the lone oh feel my way every day with his love oh fill my way every day with love let go walk with the heaven [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me go all a while with the song and a smile fill my way every day with love and keep me close to the side of my savior and God let me never in darkness ro oh keep my path free from wrath and my soul satisfied fill my way every day with love oh fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly let me go all a while with a song and a smile F my way every day with love soon the race will be your and I'll travel no more but abide in my home above sing blessed King all the way to the shore fill my way every day with love fill my way every day with love as I walk with the heaven be done oh let me go all a while with a S and a smile fill my way every day with love oh fill my way every day with love let's all stand as I walk with the Heavenly let me go all a while with a song and a smile till my way every day with love I'm going to live so God can use me anywhere Lord any time I'm going to live so God can use me anywhere Lord anytime oh I'm going to work Lord so God can use me anywhere Lord anytime I'm going to work work so God can use me anywhere anytime oh we're going to pra I'm going to praise the Lord God me [Applause] any any oh I'm going to pray so God can use me [Music] any [Music] oh my God can use me any day oh oh I'm going to pray God can use me anywhere how many of you going to love oh I'm going to love so God can use [Music] me so God can use me any day and any [Music] time you know how brother R said that that healing came by Love by love you entered into that person like the sister did praying for the little baby cuz she had a little baby and she was a mama and she knew so she entered into that and so today I thinking all the needs that we have in the building different ones we got a lot that that are gone and out brother Louis and brother Aaron are um in a foreign country today and we sure miss them but just whatever is on your heart today just bring it in bring it in the building bring it in here and let's let's let the Lord tell us what to do about it boy brother Ryan wonderful job brother good good job but let's just bring it in bring it in and give it to the Lord amen we try sometimes to work it out our own self you will fail you will fail fail every time but if you give it to the Lord he said bring your burdens and put them on me so we going to put our burdens on the Lord today everything that we have need of this is the time of the years like um brother Joe's talking about you see people that are uh this time of the year people I like this time of the year because people are happy most of the time but those that are going through issues and and losing loved ones brother Dy God bless him we're going to really pray for the family there and but anything that that goes on it just kind of it it just it it's more I guess you more it hurts you more I guess when you when you come into a time of of of having a time with family and some of the family's gone and um then you you you weren't the same one you did last year they're not there now maybe lose loved one or something it hurts but God said he'd be the one that would comfort us I can't comfort because I haven't lost a child but God can wrap his big old loving arms around you he can put his loving arms around you and he'll he'll do it by the word of God he'll he'll either put somebody like brother Joe said somebody he'll flatten your tire to get you to to get you to to be able to testify to somebody so um now how many of us have been in that position though I'm I'm and I didn't think that come on hello somebody you're there complaining why your tire was flat why this happened why that happened why' you do this why' that happen where did that nail come from how what am I going to do right hello okay I knew we were all human but then you look at the end of it though but why don't we start now and say Lord what is it am what what's next if we believe we're children of God he's going to let light afflictions and he's going to let light things happen to us that's what the Bible says to what drive us to him so that we can see that that that we are being used as brother Joe you know a flat tire to talk to a person to maybe to maybe give him a little uh you know he lost his legs give him a a little boost and then then give brother Joel a little boost say hey you're in the right channel because I'm I'm going to turn that music on that played probably 60 something years ago on a tape and that happens to be the one so that wasn't a coincidence that was God so we see him working and moving and we sure appreciate the Lord remember brother L brother Aaron I am so glad they took Aaron right off the airplane and put him in the pull pet he did a real good job if for those of you that didn't stream in it's on there somewhere on WhatsApp and sister Christine's kept us a breast of all those things so just remember that remember brother Bob he is in Mobile preaching um this coming Friday uh Saturday at 4:00 at brother burley's um is going to be a bonfire and then they're going to have a singing afterwards I'm going to try to go myself it'll be at his church if anybody like to go I can give you the address and then next Sunday we'll have one service and we're going to cut it just a little bit short cuz we're going to have a baptism okay so I'll get the pool all heated up this week and if anybody else would like to be baptized it'll be 100 degrees don't matter what it is outside that pool will be 100° and we'll baptize you but there is one young sister wants to be baptized and we're going to do it I don't care about a Christmas party all right I care about a soul all right but we will have the Christmas party afterward so don't worry we're still going to have that and that will be down at Hidden Acres um in Gillsville for those of you that are new that hadn't been here a year uh just get with me or somebody will give you the address but everybody is invited it's a catered meal I don't have to bring anything sisters don't have to cook it's all catered and they'll be down there waiting on us when we get there Remember December the 24th we're going to have one service that would be Christmas Eve but it'll be Christmas Eve day at 10:00 no Sunday school and we're probably going to have a baby dedication that day so we'll that'll be a surprise and U I was asked to do a baby dedication a couple days ago and he picked that day him and his wife did so his brother Daniel Perry and his wife so just remember that December 30th's already been announced brother Eric gu will be here at 6:00 on Saturday Sunday brother Luke Gibson will be here at 8:00 on our watch Night Service number 50 something in a row that we've had never not had one so remember remember Sister Mila she just sent me another a text a few minutes ago that she she thought it was a battery they put a new battery in and lights are still going on so she's going to try to make it back home so just remember her and Sister Christine in prayer thank God she was at sister Christine's house when all that went Bonker so there's God again man could have been on side of a road somewhere you know and this weather like it is no let her get there and that's okay listen cars break down lord can heal a car but it's still going to tear up all right Lord Heal you you still going to tear them too okay so but we're heading toward a place to where that won't happen no more that won't happen no more there'll be no e and flow it'll all be one big flow right into eternity and we're looking for that so remember that remember communion to be this afternoon and just keep all those in prayer uh parents and Lisa at their uh grandkids are being baptized in Augustus so they're down there so and Anna and Richard's at home with Dad so just remember remember the family keep us in prayer we're um trugging right along so let's U let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this service today Lord and without the brothers and sisters here wouldn't be a service at all so Lord as that word service means serve Lord I pray that you'd serve us a meal today we come asking in hungry Lord for a meal from you father and Lord I pray that you'll give it to us father and may we hear you Lord and understand what you're saying to us for the hour that we're living in forgive us of our faults and failures and our sins and sometimes as we were saying we have an attitude Lord that we shouldn't have when something happens and and there you are right in the middle of it and boy sure makes you ashamed when that happens it makes me ashamed when I see that the Lord does something like that and I become a little bit angry or or but be a human Lord but I pray that we as Christians should look for everything that that we do should be something connected to you Lord and I pray Lord that you be with us this service be with the ones that are sick be with the ones that are not here be with the ones that are in the foreign countries Lord just cover each one by your blood in Jesus name we pray amen all right part 140 we'll talk a little bit today about growth because we're and we'll talk about when you sit down so in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated and the Lord has his Blessing to the reading of the word in Colossians 1 this is what we're trying to get to for by him were all things created so God created all things this person this man that are in Heaven and Earth visible and invisible where they be Thrones dominions principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him what the powerful Gody we got here and he is before all things and by him all things consist so where's the devil in that I don't even see him in there but we we let him as Ryan said we let him poke in there somewhere all right get on our shoulder I he's a lot closer to me if he was just on my shoulder I could literally flick him off so but I he gets inside my head sometimes yeah once in a while once in the morning while in the afternoon so he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body of the church all right so he is our headship when we move he tells us to move supposely that's the way it's supposed to be because you can only move by what your body tell your head tells you to do this is a control tower right he's the beginning the firstborn from the dead and in all things he might have the prence for it pleased the father that in him now look it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell now what were we talking about last week now God is pleased that all fullness dwells in a bride amen all right and that is we'll stop here just for a moment and we'll look at the dispensations and we'll we'll see it on the chart here maybe a little bit later there's dispensations and God works in a dispensation like Luther Wesley different ones they weren't required what we were required we weren't required what they were required we we're required them plus cuz we're here at the end we got to have all things all right and and I don't think that maybe Martin Luther could have stood up and and preached the sermon that she is him he didn't have that understanding he didn't need that understanding listen God's not going to throw something out there and then nobody understands it he's going to give it to you in the portion that you need in the hour you need it in and in the dispensation so this is a the dispensation of the son of man all right now we had a dispensation we've been talking these 140 sermons we have been under the Son of God dispensation called Church ages okay all right and it started on the day of Pentecost God came back down into the People by the Holy Ghost got inside the people cleaned their soul up and then started cleaning their Spirit realm up all right but remember they weren't required to come to full adoption that's right amen okay that was not a requirement you don't it's not required when you go to this first grade it's not required that you understand calculus but you got to get the basic before you can understand calculus all right so that we can grow all right and then what what are we doing we're growing to where uh brother B calls it in morphe our our changing form so what happens is now the bride we know it's a she we know we've read a quote Brides brides Church churches Brides but there's going to come one so he's honing it all down to where a prophet of God could stand one day and it's rising of the son and say she is him yes she is him so the dispensation changed the dispensation changed from church to bride now that bride is supposed to be mature she's supposed to be not just like Jesus Christ cuz they did that down through the church ages they were like Christ but we're supposed to be Christ yes now they were they just didn't understand understand it listen it's hard to understand that the Holy Ghost never taught a false Doctrine yet Luther could stand in a pull pit and preach that just shall live by faith but be a trinitarian that didn't come from his soul realm that came from his Spirit realm but listen God said okay that's all right that's all I require you now is to come out of this church come out of this Catholic system same way with me and you he didn't requ require that you understand the full opening of the seals he didn't want you to understand that when you were a baby in Christ you were just struggling to do right yes you were just struggling to act right your dispensation is you were in the church ages you were trying to figure out who this son of God is amen not worryed about the son of man at the moment worry about who the Son of God is he's God in the form of the Holy Spirit now listen the Holy Spirit and it's continued to be the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit now working in a higher level all right the holy spirit is working now in a higher level there's more requirement listen there always has been a rocket there always has been Rocket Fuel there always has been all these things it just took a while for a man to get it together right Orville and Wilbur did not create a spaceship they were just trying to get out off the ground and they got like 30 feet off the ground and went a couple hundred feet and they were like wow well man you know what do we do we laugh at that now but the people watching it was like wow that's something new wow that's something new they're 30t off the ground they went 200 feet in the air well what came from that brother Aaron got an airplane in Atlanta flew all the way down to Central America you can get in a plane now and you can fly all the way almost to the Philippines Halfway Around the World in the same plane and they feed you 3 Mill a day or three meals in the flight give you all kind of entertainment well now Orville and Wilbur didn't have that so when you were a newborn baby in Christ you were just trying to get up off the ground yes sir all right I'm backing up just a little bit cuz I want to tell you about dispensations cuz we're fixing to change one we've been in the Son of God dispensation is the church ages the seven Church ages there was a dispensation that God was working through a group of people trying to get them saved right or filled with the Holy Ghost but not so much coming to maturity now he's also wanted he's always wanted us to come to maturity because Peter preached it but then the Catholic Church picks it up and says you don't need to be mature just listen to what we got to say because we're the mature one well that was the devil standing there everybody with me cuz God wants to work through his people as Bob was talking about with the nickolath and spirit we'll get into that when we talk about the in the seals it conquered the people the the people just finally just got so blinded and they just said okay whatever we're just going to go to church and we're going to you're going to preach in Latin we're going to understand what you say but we know when you do this right here and we do this that everything's all right right sister everything's good go back home do whatever you want to do but just make sure that you do what Papa Pope says and we're good well you see that was a dispensation listen he's going to be some Catholic bride oh yeah oh don't get quiet on me there's going to be some Catholic bride cuz they lived in their dispensation that they lived in everybody with me now they didn't they weren't Catholic like Catholic Catholic but even Martin Luther Martin Luther was half Catholic even when he come out he was still bringing some of the Catholic church with him out of there and Columba in the Dark Ages all of different ones worked in Catholicism I don't think go listen I don't think for one minute that God for that 15 UND years of Dark Ages that there was nobody saved somebody became bride during that time somebody accepted the message of the hour for their hour and became bride listen we sit here today knowing that we have the most powerful message in the world yes formidable opponent opponent to the devil AB but you know what when we get into that future home we don't we only going to be like one Street 99% of the people never heard of this message they're a bride they're already gone they're already in another dimension waiting on us to bring them here oh no it's going to be full of message Believers yeah it's going to be full of message Believers for their message for their day so we don't disclude all those but you know let God separate them yes sir don't worry about it we going to try to pull them all in remember brother around said draw the circle bigger amen all right but now we got to realize the dispensation we're in now is that God is now requiring that he's been in human flesh for 2,000 years now listen to me a minute he's been in flesh for 2,000 years right now he wants us to use that Aaron's not here I'm cutting the cool on cuz I'm hot I know the ones of you the fan and not just keep flies off of you maybe keep you awake right Jeffrey yeah ah air conditioning see there we got all we got to do is punch a button that's right Martin Luther and him probably would have they would have loved to had some of this air conditioning when they were outside preaching like I was talking about John Wesley reading his he preach 20 sermons a day he jumped up he one time he didn't have a place to preach he jumped up on somebody's mosum in the middle of a cemetery and started preaching you know what one souls to god what have we ever done but now that requirement has come to us to become to full maturity there not be a piece left there not be one section of this body not working that's why from now today from day forward it's serious time yes it's serious time we've had a whole year when we were talking about let it out get the thing whatever it is get it out and let's get something in or let the Holy Ghost out and let him reflect himself in a group of people to the world all right but she is him can you can you swallow that that you are God made manifest in another form called a bride that you are the manifestation not a manifestation you're the manifestation of God for the day and hour you're living in yes all right that's updated Revelation that's a dispensation that we come to the Brides brides churches Brides but they'll come what which is here now today yes sir and she is him so whatever the Bible talks of Jesus Christ now he's talking about you now back in the church church ages they couldn't preach that Jesus Is Here We must believe he's our savior right right believe on Lord Jesus Christ and thou shal be saved but you got to bring it now to where Prophet stood one day brother Tim pu was preaching yesterday at the at a Minister's meeting and he did a real good job about bringing bringing everything back in we got to realize every time that God talks about and gives a promise to the Lord Jesus in the Bible it's for me and you yes we're it's the same thing it's HS and Joint HS he got a glorified body you're going to get a glorified body you're going to have to suffer a little bit he said look take up your what take up your cross and follow me so you got a cross to bear you don't have to get up here and physically die but you got to cross you got to drag around with you all the time but she is him there's a manifestation now of God in this dispensation that's physical it's been physical all along we just haven't been able to understand it it now is physical that she is him that Adam and Eve were literally the same person that's right DNA from Adam DNA from Eve couldn't tell the difference because they came from she came out from him amen that's where where did we come from we came from out of him all right and that's that's where he wanted us to fellowship with us he wanted Adam was lonely remember God was lonely he made Adam Adam was lonely he made Eve okay so God's been lonely the whole time I was telling you before and I was telling him down at brother Martin's last weekend the Lord Jesus has not laid eyes on us physically he's waiting to see his bride physically see us oh when we get caught up in the air he's going to be you talking about being caught up he's going to physically see us Regina we're going to be right there with him and he's going to be able to touch us he's not able to touch us now he has nobody on this Earth but me and you he can hear us through the blood amen cuz we've not come to Perfection totally yet this thing's still dead that's right remember brother brandom he went across a curtain of time but where was his body his body was still there because it was born in sin that was the part that needed to be changed or go to the grave and be brought up in a resurrection that's the two things that we got to deal with but in this this dispensation is though is that somebody is not going to die according to the Bible according to the prophet's message someone is going to stand on this Earth and as brother Randon we were talking before in the adoption series he said you won't be praying for people anymore you'll be commanding the thing now brother Ryan what did he just tell y'all he commanded that devil to leave him alone he commanded that Devil he's going to believe it right here brother John he commanded that devil to get off his shoulder we think the devil's got his filthy claws dug in us he's not he's just sitting there right come on you think oh no he's got his claws you let him you you know what you did you let him sit there long enough to get fingernails help preach a little bit today you let him sit there so long he he become a part he he took Roots if you'll get him off to begin with you can get him off a whole lot quicker but this is what we have to realize this is our time brother B was talking about Easter and this is rising of the sun it's 1965 this is uh less than a year before he passed on he he was able to tell us this and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth now come forth from what him all right that's why we've been talking about the statute of perfect man this is the dispensation of the Son of God this is this is your seven Church ages everybody with me this right here has not been known by man until the end time and we'll read it a little bit he left the Earth the son of man left CU it was God in human flesh God in human flesh he left but remember what the angel said said that same one you see leaving that same one now that same one didn't come back on the day of Pentecost he came back in spirit form on the day of Pentecost he didn't come back in flesh form in their flesh yes but I mean when he was standing there brother George he was standing there on that mountain or wherever he was and he was what he he ascended well he took his body with him his Earthly body it all went but those two angels said hey you see that cloud you see that cloud that same Lord Jesus you see go up he's facing to come back in the same way he left and he is now in his bride amen but he came back on the day of Pentecost as the New Birth as the as the soul of God being parted out among a group of people that were trying to live the word of God the best they knew how but there's more requirement now there's more requirement that we are what wife that we use this uh power and authority that we have not power and authority to zap your boss out of existence or that guy that cut you off on the road or or you know the person that was mad at you in Walmart or something no that's not what it's used for right to me I want to focus on trying to get everybody saved and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost that's what I want whole family everybody everybody connected to me am man you ought to do that you say oh no that per now wait a minute God might have said the same thing about you one day when somebody's trying to talk to you about the Lord and you're like running off somewhere or you're running over under and running [Music] away he caught you though didn't he he caught you you know why cuz you stood still long enough brother BR said she he's got to get the bride what to stand still long enough so he can dress her we'll get that quote a little bit later on but he's got we're doing this stand still be still you read that thing right there be still and know that I am God now not be still and be a statue but be a stature we'll read it here in just a few minutes where the Lord Jesus grew in stature not statue sure we're all going to grow in statue unless you're unless you're stunning growth we're all going to grow in Statue because we're eating but we got to grow in stature which is growth development everybody with me so she's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life do we really believe that all right there was one purpose he had that God might dwell in his church now here look one purpose that God might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church sir not just dwell in her her sit there and enjoy life and enjoy s church service no to be used by God continue his plan through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plan through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church all right now see brother rown in 1959 he's saying Church well now that could be Baptist Methodist Pentecostal he was preaching to a whole group of people right but we come to the seals though and he says hey I now call you bride in other words words I weeded out he didn't but his message weeded out remember he's preached to thousands of people thousands of people when he was healing but when he come down to preach the Raptor message he preached it in a trailer out in Arizona there's only 30 something people I think in the in in the trailer this great message of the Rapture what happened honing time they couldn't take it so they left listen if you don't have the Holy Ghost today you're going to leave physically you're going to leave because you can't stand it you can't stand it so you'll physically leave cuz you don't have the Holy Ghost I ain't talking about going somewhere and I'm talking about you you see people you see people come in as one brother I've always love him still love him still see him all the time man he sit on the front row and he would just pull like you wouldn't believe and I mean he not like some of y'all like falling asleep he be be on that front row right there and he'd be he's gone he had some fuel but he didn't have no fire he had a little fuel but it takes some mechanics and the Dynamics to do it sir cuz listen you won't walk away from this message with the Holy Ghost the message of the hour is the Holy Ghost for the hour do you understand what I'm saying cuz you can't get Luther's Holy Ghost now it's the same Holy Ghost but you can't get his type cuz that's just justification that's just getting you stu started now the requirement is full adoption as brother R said many many times and continue his work through the church all right let's continue all that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured into Christ now that's a dispensation there was a dispensation of Jehovah and the Old Testament God above us there's no way he could get in man because of what because of the sin curse and the blood of an animal could only cover or Capo put it over the top of it and your sin would go through and God would forgive you but your sin stayed there the sin person was still inside of you that's right so you had to go back to next year and do another one you had to go to back the next year you read that in the book of Hebrews brother Bob's already been through it because if it would just been the blood of bulls and goats you'd come up here one time a year throw your sacrifice down we'd kill it and you'd go back home right for some of y'all that would be easy but it's a continuous going behind the veil not depending on the preacher to do it or the deacons or the Sunday School teachers you got to go behind the bail you got to come boldly to the throne of grace you know why cuz you can back then it was death to walk in there there was no way you would be a complete idiot to even get close to that holy of holies it was so revered in only one person and he had to be completely covered by oil completely covered by the different colors that he was required to do or he died right the pomegranates and the as he walked holy holy they could hear him they said oh he's still alive he's good he's good and when he walked down and said hey your sins are forgiven for another year wow I don't want my sins forgiven for a year cuz I might live another one sister Regina and them babies are coming back I want that sin curse gone all right I I do believe in once saved always saved if you get the Holy Ghost you can't lose it that's right right amen we may fall we may stumble we may head backwards every once in a while hey it's like brother Ryan said get up and go don't quit don't quit now you take a young man maybe I'll just preach a little bit today you take a young man like brother Ryan now I've saw him how old you when we first met 17 good grief how old are you now9 39 shut your mouth can got four young and a wonderful beautiful wife but when we first met Ryan he a little rough cuz he was so naive yeah that's right he was so naive yeah but he showed up everywhere he's like a gnat he was always there he's always there right you know you look there's Ryan you want to go to fellowship meeting yes yes I do there's right you want to go to this yes there's right you want to play the drums yeah I'm I'm good and then we go to those Fellowship meetings and bless his heart we had a van back then and he we'd get in go to brother Tom cranes and he would he' just have a sorry mouthful of puke and cuz he'd have to hold it back but he went right not like some of us is brother Bob said get a sniffle and a cat or cat get sick and stay home brother Ryan fought through that thing I mean we'd go down through that we I mean I mean it was 3 hours to brother Tom cran and all up through the mountains Highway 64 and Ryan was like but you know what he never complained actually didn't even realize it to one day I think he said something because he looked like a ghost he was white as a sheet but you know what he persevered he kept going he kept going he he kept going to camp meetings he kept or youth meetings and kept going to the camp meetings and met Gabby I couple at first may I cuz I knew them all I remember her testimony in 2006 I believe it was right at the meeting where she where she felt like committing suicide you have too right if you hadn't get ready cuz that Devil's still around I just read in the paper yesterday the suicide rate in the United States is up like 30% a lot of it is overdose but a lot of it people can't handle stuff cuz this world they don't know what this world is they don't know what tomorrow is they don't know what the next day is they don't know where they're going or they really don't know where they came from but you say oh now wait a minute that's not in the message cuz we know who we are baloney it's right here it's in this building but you got to fight it fight that thing listen God is a life what a life Giver not a life taker if somebody wants you to take your life it's the devil and he's got an end am God does not have an end that's what God said about us the Lord Jesus died on a cross for depression he died on the cross for people that want to commit suicide he died on the cross for all for adulterers and all that's what he died for he didn't die for the good people come on the good people hated him cus and all them they P God I ain't never done nothing wrong you know what you did you just turned down God that's what you did you didn't do anything wrong maybe in the out in the world but cuz you know people still depended on Kus even after Jesus went on out gone and they still depended on Kus to go in there once a year but that dispensation changed to a dispensation of a bride it went out of that church when he left he come back in a bride he didn't come back in that church that's why brother Brown says this will never be denominated this can't go back into a denomination like even Luther went into denomination Wesley into a denomination now you can't look at the Wesleyan Church now or look at the United Methodist some are United Methodist some are just Methodist because of the gay agenda and all these different things but you can't tell this one over here that they're still wrong too you can't do that that praise God that they come out of that junk but go higher that's where God is God's Not back there anymore he's here amen and he's here to fulfill your need because look Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that Jehovah was Old Testament poured into Christ the New Testament yes and all that Christ was he poured into the church look not into one individual right but into the entire body yes sir there's where we come together in unity we have power that's why we're Lambs we're her animals we have power together if you ever get separated from your church or from the Believers you know that's not God and you know you're not going to win you will fail that devil will sink his teeth in you but all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ was is in you Christ Myster God revealed brother R said and then to bring that fullness of the godhead body into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading why does he want that he can't work in false Doctrine he can't work when we come to church and we're not we're not born again he's not going to can't use you you got to be born again you got to be in a family before you even be adopted oh yeah we can work yeah keep coming to church keep coming brother Luis your ago he'll tell you he went to a certain church for a long time message church when he come to this church he said I sat there and he said for three months I think brother Bob and brother Joe said just sit and listen cuz Brother D was he's he's rough sometimes and he's and he's he's a wonderful teacher but sometimes he gets up in the atmosphere but if you'll listen long enough why can't you realize the Holy Ghost Inside of You has got to bring you the truth of that what he's talking about right cuz he's not confused he's not the author of confusion amen amen but Lou said I sat there for about 3 months he said all of a sudden things started falling together kind of like a Tetris game you know he said things went into place he said I started seeing things he said I realized I didn't have the Holy Ghost and he' been in another church and been preaching that's fine at least he realized he needed the new birth and he said he received it right here now he never came to the Altar and raised his hand up he it right where he was at ain't that the way we're supposed to do brother the Bible tells us that as the word went forth the Holy Ghost fell and people got the Holy Ghost amen sure it's good to come up here it's good to pray for the people now let's not do away with that but when we going to start accepting like a gentile yes Lord I'm an authority you're in Authority you just speak the word you don't have to go lay hand jarus is like come on in here lay lay your hands on me lay hands on my daughter L hands on my not not Gentile way right Gentile way is God whatever you say that's the way it's going to be so Christ mystery of God reveal said look now the complete fullness of the godhead body dwells in his church the premen is all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church the Believers look the Believers not the church the Believers all right what's his purpose now look Express himself as a son and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily talk about Colossians then look at the very end through this life of this son he's going to have a bride which is Eve the second Eve and that's me and you sitting here today Mighty God unveiled before us said then it was God in them days it was God and a man his son Jesus Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man not an ordinary human why because the spirit was God ours is not Hello ours is not we're heading there but our spirit is a spirit of man his Spirit was a spirit in Sun Times and divers marage spoke to the prophet the Holy Spirit that's why he was perfect that's why he didn't make mistakes when he spoke the word of God but now remember I'm going to read you a scripture here where it seems like he made some mistakes now as a human I believe he did I don't believe as a little child he just sat there and everything was good and he didn't throw his food in the floor and no uhuh no that's not the god that's I want that God to be so human that I understand him and he understands me all right so now it's God in men look God in a man now it's God in men the fullness of God and the God had bodily in his entire church manifest himself fulfilling his word now look so what is he talking about the fullness of the godhead B was in Jesus Christ all right let's stop right here just for a second pause pause for a second wake up punch yourself so the the fullness of godhead bodly was in Jesus Christ right he was the son of man right he made no mistakes in his Doctrine right but Luther had problems with his Doctrine Wesley had problems with theirs I'll read it to you in a minute where brother bar said you Pentecostals in other words you cabbage down on this gift part you didn't move on right right okay Baptist you had for a time you were good you had the truth but God moved and you didn't that's right right Jesus never said I do just about what the father says he says I only do that what the father says so that's the son of man that's God in human flesh being control that flesh being so controlled by God till it was God you said well that's impossible for me well you just stopped yourself CU says now it's God in men look the fullness of God he didn't say part amen because what we're going to look at in just a minute the reason we have to have these dispensations is is the Son of God dispensation did not require everybody to be the fullness of the godhead bodily there were flaws in their Doctrine listen I'm tell you one more time the son of man never preached a sermon that was wrong but now Luther did Wesley did Pentecost did they all did brother Brandon preached wrong until when till the seals open right oh boy people don't like that but he did he said he did he said I'd made a horrible mistake if ID have went back on my regular notes and preach the in other words he's going to preach a Wilder rider was the Holy Ghost he's the Antichrist but when the seals open so now you and I are working under that son of man dispensation that's why Luke 17:30 and all these different things said that son of man's got to come back in the end time to get in a group of people and not divide us that's right not divide Us by Doctrine but bring us together yes and it's only going to be a very short small group of people the fullness of the godhead fullness of God in the godhead bodily in his entire church manifest himself fulfilling his work now well we find now see God for all ages he had skin on it he's been veiled behind skin since the day of Pentecost 2,000 years ago but the fullness of the godhead bodily has not been required until now because remember he left as a son of man he left with that dispensation with him right right okay he was cut off that's what Jesus kept saying you're going to cut me off you're going to kill me and the disciples are going what are you talking about what do you mean you three days you tear this Temple down three days it took us 49 years to build this Temple how you going to they weren't thinking they were thinking carnal he was speaking spiritual but I'll guarantee you on the day of Pentecost Peter James and John and all the different ones that were up there they understand a little bit what understood a little bit what God was talking about cuz remember he said you can't take this now but when I come back I'll lead you and guide you into all truth Peter after the day of Pentecost Peter didn't try to cut nobody's ear off he preached till their ears fell off but he he ain't cut by his ear off cuz he matured he grew all right so God is in skin but he's in skin now to be revealed yes as the son of man Jesus Christ on Earth we saw a little portion of it with brother brandom but you're going to see in the fullness in the bride all right cuz look Jesus was telling them he stood there one day and said the stone which the builders rejected he's talking about himself the Revelation the stone that the church was supposed to be built on was standing there in front of them and they rejected him yeah right so I'm going to now become the head of the corner I'm coming down as Zer rubbable and take the foundation and then I'm going to put the plumet to the line and I'm going to build this great Army back up again remember Joel says I'll get this great Army back four eat it four brings it back all right so why didn't just three bring it back though why didn't why it why isn't it just justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost why has it got to be number four which is the word back in power again all right the word's been in power in part we know in part we prophesy in part but that which is perfect has come that which is in part to be done away with now that doesn't mean done away with but that means hid away right that means hid away they were in another they're all in another dimension waiting on me and you to come to full maturity all right but the stone which the builders rejected which was him the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you in other words taken from the Jews we already been over this and given to a nation what a gentile bride yes that will bring forth those fruits all right then here's rising of sun there's been churches churches Brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one there's got to come a real bride not that they were false but there's got to become one that's the son of man that's God in human flesh without error right you see can't do it no you can't but he can he can through you remember preeminence he's got to give you the preeminence he's got to have the preeminence in me and you Revelations 3:14 says to the angel of the Church of the layout of sins this is our age or the age we're living in the time period these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness not that there was false Witnesses but watch this word true the beginning of the creation of God you read that one more time the beginning of the creation of God how can God have a beginning he had a beginning the way he wanted to be in Jesus Christ that's right which was God in flesh right now as being the beginning of the creation of God now why didn't he put that brother Mark why wasn't that in in the first church age why didn't God put that in the first church age no he goes over to the first church age we're going to cover the church ages maybe during the year Lord with him first church age right to get-go brother George right at the foundation part God said you bless your first love right you're not doing what you're supposed to do you got off the foundation I'll take your name out you just keep reading all the all the things but he comes up here to this last Church age he says the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God how was God how did God want to be created he wanted to be in human flesh back into the Garden of Eden to produce me and you amen why do you wait till this church age to start that because it's the son of man Revelation coming back in power the beginning of the creation of God who was Jesus Christ he was the son of man when he was born he was a son of man the Son of God was inside of him but he was the son of man the fullness of the godhead bodily now look at this word true now this comes right from strong that word right there truth says that which has not only the name and resemblance watch now not only the name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to the name brother rown say you can say one day they'll be they'll be where they say Jesus Jesus and not get anything why because they've made Satan Jesus come on that's what the Bible says Satan wants to be worshiped as God not like God as God sitting in the temple of who God showing him s that he is God but the real nature corresponding to the that name the Lord Jesus Christ is me and you that's the real bride that's the true bride but the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect look corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true and genuine what did they do in the church ages we'll read it again The Book of Revelations what did they do they took another name they said you the Lord says you got a name you're living by but you're dead yes and it wasn't Satan it was Jesus Christ but they said you don't need a name let's just do these titles Father Son and Holy Ghost right that's why all that had to be restored in this age yes listen if this is boring you please go somewhere where you can get some excitement if this is boring you please or if you can find somebody that can help you get excited bring him here but you can't sit there and flipping sleep during the sermon and don't and think well I'm getting it no you're not you don't care I'm sorry the Lord's tired of this how many of you will sit and watch a movie for three hours and never bat an eye take watch a game making sure that you don't miss one play hello you ever walked away and be watching a movie and walk away and come back 20 minutes later you never done that before you hit pause cuz you don't want to miss what's going on hello right ain't that right I do the same thing hit that pause button when you come back 20 minutes later that guy still going why because you don't want to miss what that guy's fixing to do after he does this well let's respond to God now the same way let's say Amen when amen needs to be said because look we are the faithful and true witness we say oh that's Jesus Christ well I just told you for 20 minutes where's he at now he's in his bride and he's quickening everything that he said 2,000 years ago whatever you read in the Bible he's supposed to be quickening that I know more than I did a year ago I hope you do amen you know what that wasn't the devil did that the devil want you to know less than you did a year ago but if you know just a sentence brother Ryan tell them if you just hold on to one sentence and say God that's it right there I'm hanging on to that I'll hang on to this and like brother Ram said if this ain't it I'm gonna hang on right here yes sir until that comes oh did I knock the sorry about [Applause] that Bo devil calm down I can't calm down cuz listen we're the wife of a king we're the wife of a king we are royalty right God said we were that's right let's start acting like royalty I don't stick in nose up in the air but be humble humble you know you look at those the the different rulers in kingdoms and and even like Queen Elizabeth and different ones they they weren't harsh rulers harsh rulers didn't last very long that's right Hitler all the different ones they came to a very funny end they either took their own life or they were killed but you get somebody that will sit down with you and talk to you and not put that barrier you know from here to here same way with with all of us there's no big eyes and little you there's no there's no there's no great ones among us we we're all the same the only thing I believe I have is a gift to explain a little bit of what God's give us for y'all to get us to get and that's it that's all but there is part of our life that we have to give that but that's fine with me I don't I don't mind that one bit no cuz I want to see a mature wife whether I make it or not I want to see a mature wife I want to see God act in a church that's right absolutely in a people absolutely if it's not me that's okay but I want to see it now brother D's always said that remember he had the remember he had the vision the other the years and years ago about helping people up the mountain he didn't go right absolutely but he was helping people up the mountain up the mountain and put them in a what spaceship remember there was a spaceship and they were getting they were going up into that spaceship he was helping them get to the spaceship well we want to help each other get to that same spaceship cuz you know what that spaceship's going to do it's going to take us into another dimension it's not going to explode it's not going to take us to another country it's not going to take us to where there's trials and tribulations it's going to take us out of here it's going to take us into a wedding supper to where we can look at our lover and and say oh if you had come if you hadn't send us that Prophet we'd be as blind as the world is now we'd be blind you'd be walking at tomorrow you'd be going well what's going to happen the next day well what's going to happen the next day no we already got yesterday tomorrow's news yesterday's news we got all the news we know what's going to happen absolutely we know what's coming we know we are not going to go through the tribulation we know we are not going to stand judgment God ought to make a shout right there but being married I read this the other day and I want to read just a little bit more but cuz God give us a help meet not a helpmate all right somebody to help us so when you grow old who will take care of you for many that caretaker will be a spouse but does marriage actually improve life expectancy here's what research show marriage was one of the first non-biological now that means something you can't put medicine to biological is your biological self okay biology this is the first nonbiological factors identified as improving life expectancy it ain't a pill it ain't a shot it's being married now now listen this is typing us in Christ if you're not married and don't have a spouse Christ is your head right all right amen and if you stay married to him I'd rather be married to him than be married to June and where she's sitting there if I'm married to Christ me and her will be okay but if I'm not married to Christ K Barrow the door we talking about yesterday these people spend 25 and 30 and $40,000 on weddings 5 years later they're divorced all had to put that money up they could have divided it after 5 years and had $20,000 a piece right if you want to look at it that way but I mean it's just a waste of money but that's the way but that's the way the world is oh it's okay we're going to have drive by drive by divorces anyway you go through the drivethru and say I'll take that one but that's not what God wants the explanation was given that married people tend to take fewer risks with their health and have better mental and emotional health hello somebody ain't that what happened when you get born again you don't do the things you used to do don't drink smoke cut and do all those things right you try to live a little better healthy and then your mental health and your emotional health if you're a Christian it's got to be better than the world it's got to be yeah marriage also provides more social and material support read your Bible steady pray to your lover which means having someone to take you to the doctor well I want somebody take me to the great physician do you amen amen you got a need today go to the great physician you ain't got to go to your regular doctor go to the great physician if you need to go to the regular doctor that's okay but they can't heal you they can give you a pill or give you a shot and they give you a Band-Aid but God just want to heal anyway someone to take care take you to the doctor and care for you when you're sick it can save your life married people live longer and healthier lives listen if you're not married to Christ you have a very short life expectancy but if you're married to Christ you can't even put a date on the end of it Hallelujah come on you can't put a date on the end of it the power of marriage is particularly evident in late middle age that's wait a minute late middle we're already past that most of us so anyway we look at mortality differences and it it's just I don't want to read the rest of that you just read it if you want to you just look it up on the line it's got to be true right Amy in fact I mean look this person's named I sing Lee okay he it's got to be a maybe AI who knows they compiled a catalog look being unmarried is one of the greatest risk that people voluntarily subject theel to I say Amen if you're not married to Christ you're married to the devil right and your risk is going to be much higher so true come on sick people who are married live longer than their unmarried counterparts amen Eternal versus not science of studied immune functions in the laboratory finds that happily married couples have better functioning immune systems wow Amy did you know that it's got to be true don't lie you look at up happy happily married couples have better functioning immune system divorced people even years after the divorce show much lower levels of immune functions wow don't worry I'm not preaching on marriage and divorce but listen there's many facts and I've all I've never said it from the pull pit but I'll say it today there are many factors when you talk about divorce it it's it's horrible to begin with God hates it okay the Bible tells you not to do it but some have done it anyway okay that doesn't Knock You Out of Heaven it just knocks you away from a mental battle right you you'll battle yourself the whole time but just being just being that one thing that you get a divorce and you have to live alone or then you pick a different spouse and it's not the right one come on I mean I'm talking about life here so let's get married to Christ first and make sure that person that you're looking at young people is married to Christ first when that person that person is married to Christ first I'll promise you you may have some issues come on but you'll live a lot longer life and you'll be a lot more happier right if you know Christ first so marry him first marry somebody that's married to Christ first when you do that listen you take the divorce Factor right out of the way okay all right so anyway I dropped that in and you didn't go out the door we're good all right so let's look just for a minute now we talk about this man the Lord Jesus we talk about the son of man this is God in human flesh all right this is almighty God all right and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man brother John in his Humanity he had to grow in stature not statue that's stature all right now watch this right here HEB Bruce 5'8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things he suffered this is this is hold on this is almighty God this is the fullness of the godhead bodily this is a person that was born the way they were supposed to be born this is a person that has no carnal mind come on Amen this is the Lord himself this is God Almighty listen I do not believe for one moment he was a man and then he became God if he was a if he was a man we need to find that man that's right he was God Almighty the Bible said he was what Emmanuel born Emmanuel God With Us that's enough for me am that's right hallu he was born God but he was born a human all right God and man became one but though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered that's right look and being made [Music] perfect and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him right this is the fullness of the godhead Bing all right let me skip over here real quick then we'll close right here don't look at that it's going to hurt you going to hurt your eyes get all the way down here at the bottom all right now look let's look at the dispensation now we're going to this afternoon we are going to talk about this interval so if you come back tomorrow this afternoon bring your Bible with you or I'm going to try to maybe run some scoffield does a good job of of breaking it apart so so you can see it I didn't have time to do it I mean it had been pages of scripture to show those intervals or show those gaps like 1 2 3 4 5 6 we'll talk about that this afternoon because it's very important it's very important that you look at that interval and what happens between that time because remember there's nothing not happen something's happening during that time all right like we said dispensation change we've had Church ages Church ages Church ages bride churches churches bride now there's one all right and now she's required to be the fullness of God body she's actually the one that brings the Gap together right what brings that Gap together the Holy Spirit yes but it's the holy spirit in full maturity not the Holy Spirit down here right all right we'll talk about it this afternoon now look why wasn't he recognized as the son of man the son of man was the spiritual revelation of prophet son of man means Prophet all right he talks about turn over in the Bible in Ezekiel the promised word of that hour being made manifest oh I'm sorry Jehovah called him a man the son of man the same as Jesus revealed himself as the son of man what was it the promised word look of that hour Jesus didn't come in Moses this time Jesus didn't come in Moses he didn't come with John's message but yet he and John were overlapping all right we'll get into that maybe later on too God of ezekiel's time God of Jesus's time son of man he was not at that time listen he was the son of man because he had come to reveal himself to Israel as a prophet and they rejected it remember they rejected The Headstone which is the son of man right all right they rejected him God said that's okay I don't care I'm going to start I'm going to have my church I'm going to come right back I'm going to build a foundation and that was the prophecy that they should receive in him in in the name of the son of man a prophet because it was according to the word Deuteronomy 18:15 Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like an unto me and when he come he identified himself look he never called himself the Son of God they called him a Son of God he said you say cuz he identified himself he identified himself in his ministry as a man not a son of God Son of Man God is a spirit and he revealed himself as son of man what he claimed to be and they were blinded and couldn't see it all right but now unto to the Gentiles he reveals himself and now the Son of God which is the Holy Ghost now look that's the dispensation holy ghost in in the church ages all right now Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now I didn't put the rest of that quote but remember what happens the son of man's to be revealed again all right proving his word when he was on Earth he was the son of man he could not be the Son of God he never claimed to be he was the son of man all right now you keep going a little bit further the message of the hour cannot come through theology he's talking about the message he's bringing not Son of God there he had to be the son of man now watch then he served his office as son of man then he serves his office now as a Son of God see brother randam is standing preaching in the Son of God dispensation but he's the only one that knows about the son of man dispensation right he was the Gap just like John stood and introduced Jesus brother R stood in the Gap and introduced Jesus right to the world all right then he served his office now as Son of God God is a spirit and when now he served through the church ages as the Son of God now the Millennium he be son of David we know that goes to the Jews but there's a time period that you're in right now that you're in the son of man dispensation God's got to come back and cap that put that cap back on that pyramid that's the reason he cannot be the Son of God now watch this will prove something and then we'll then we'll pause for this afternoon that's the reason he could not be the Son of God there what where he was standing on Earth because he was the son of man the word comes to the prophet and he was the word in its fullness watch son of man the major prophet not the major prophet but God Prophet now watch the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him therefore or in other words that made him the son of man that's why the son of man can't come back in power until the end time when the fullness of the godhead B is being revealed which is the son of man that's what makes us the son of man as a collective body not me not brother brandham he was a son of man revealing the son of man but there's your characteristic Son of God dispensation is not the fullness of the godhead ble it's God and his bride trying to get them to see things they have these um doctrines that got to deal with but the son of man never had a doctrine that was wrong right when he left this Earth that day 2,000 years ago when he went up he can he could look back and say I never preached a false Doctrine right and how many can say that here well we're supposed to be able to do that coming up right here for 2,000 years he's been known as the Son of God Luke 17:30 says even thus shall it be in the day the day not one day the day we're in the day of the Lord like John was on aisle of pmas even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is what revealed he's here already he's here in his church but he's got to be revealed Matthew 17 verse1 and after six days well after six days so they're in the seventh day Jesus Took Peter James and John bring them to a high mountain and was transfigured before him now we know that was the hear you himm part I'm kind of skipping through this a little bit because it's 11:50 and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared on him Moses and Elijah talking with him now Moses and Elijah listen Moses and Elijah appearing to him everybody with me that's a Jewish dis dispensation not ours all right so they came to him to to talk to him about brother Ram said about the future right because who is the two prophets that's going to take the Revelation over there that's right it's not going to be the son of man Revelation though we get the son of man Revelation that we do just like he did we go up in the cloud that's right okay everybody with me answered Peter and said oh it's good to be here listen Peter starts interjecting his own Doctrine we're going to build three Tabernacles Jesus said sh cuz look says while he yet spake something stopped him and said hey Behold a voice out of the cloud which says this is my beloved Son and whom I pleased well pleased hear you him look and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid now here's Jesus Moses and Elijah have gone because they're going to the Jews and he's going in that dispensation so he's standing there with his bride for the moment they weren't bride yet because they had went to the went to the upper room but they were potentially bride all right and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw Jesus by himself now watch and when they came down from the mountain here's what I want you to see we stand to your feet Jesus charged them saying Jesus said hey we got a scene going on here I've been I've been looking about actors and scenes and different things and five parts of a drama and all that stuff I want to re I want to re um I want to re-enter that where um U Brother Richard Douglas did about a year or so ago because brother R talks about when he when the seals open it was actors in a play it was a play going on and they were acting apart all right and as as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying look tell this Vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead now why' he say again he should have just said now listen tell the vision of no man until the son of man be risen from the dead cuz he died 6 months after this right here he died he physically died they put him in a tomb and he came back right right he says come back again risen again well you're in the rising part right now you're in the second coming of the son of man he was there one time he's come back here tell the vision of no man till the son of man be risen again from the dead now what brother R tell us he told us he said he was in there and they killed him right the denominations he had to come out of the denominations put them away and marry a new bride right which is us so the son of man has now be risen again again he's now being risen the second time in his church in his bride in his people in the fullness of the godhead bodily but we're waiting for the adoption yes to with the Redemption of our body we are now in the dispensation of the son of man and listen folks I'm going to say this lightly God's waiting is about over God's waiting on us being frivolous and not and not doing what we're supposed to do me included is about over we either got to tow the line we got to come to the plummet we've got to come into that line or we don't make it that's just I'm sorry the dispensation had to move and listen now hold on a minute when God moves if we don't move what happens we become a denomination that's right you say in this message no they can't make it a denomination where they said this is brandom uh United brandom Church no or United Methodist Church but they've made it that CU they've not took the furtherance of the word they've not took all the word they just take the part they want yeah in the message and we may have some faults too but I believe that that that if you'll go back and start listening to brother Dale different different ones from this church pretty much on the Mark if it didn't I wouldn't be here I'd go find like Brother D said if you can find something better go find it he said but don't leave me here take me with you right cuz we're searching for that we're searching for the word of God we're searching for for the truth you say well I'm sitting in truth I'm talking about the faithful and true witness the one that when that message sounds you say that ain't nothing but the truth or you don't sit there and go I don't know if that's true or not well you better get to praying better get to praying better get reading your Bible better get study in the message and catch up cuz this true and we got to come to this adoption before we come to the Redemption of the body the son of man Ministry is here the son of man dispensation the son of man anointing is here what are we going to do about it let's sing a song [Music] soad Lord sing it to him so glad so glad you're [Music] Mery has follow me
