know you just remember that uh in doing Zechariah 4 and 2 Corinthians 12 Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace your love your understanding we thank you for the day and the time that we have upon the Earth and we just ask you now to come Among Us in a mighty way to speak to our hearts this morning in your understanding because that's what we desire more than anything else we ask you to

good and we ask you to just touch him and just remember each and every one of us have your way with each one we love you and we thank you for your word and we commit it to you now and guide us in Jesus name Amen in Zechariah 4 and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereof that and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of The Bold and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talk with me saying what are these my Lord remember these are symbolics so he's wanting to know then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zeru Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof shouting crying Grace Grace unto it now let's just stop there on that one and because that's where we're getting to then we will just use part of the verse n of 2 Corinthians 12 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been speaking about the displaying of God's attributes and uh I hope you've enjoyed it maybe we may have another message this afternoon but we'll just have to wait and see uh on this part and and then I want to and one reason for reading Zachariah is it's talking of the candlesticks and the things and if you'd like to read ahead of me and and things read the first chapter of Revelations and we'll try to get into because I've had it kind of a thought to speak about the Sevenfold Glory of his person am you know so we may try to go into that uh either this afternoon or next Sunday the Lord will but we've been talking about Redemption and we've seen from our life's message on talking on the displaying of God's attributes because we know that that's what he's doing still is doing been doing amen from the beginning is displaying his attributes attributes is what you are you're you're uh you know you are the attribute of your parents you're uh you know uh when you use using the word attribute it just simply means it the product and we know that God before the world ever begun that he had a plan and a purpose to uh come into view all right and in doing that then he would uh tie it up into his entire word and bring it forth to uh bring us the understanding of that what he's doing he didn't intend for man to fall because that would not be his uh you can't bring that out of God because there's no way to bring out a a fall out of an eternal God but yet he knew by the creating of man in the way that he created us and giving us free moral agency he knew that we would fall amen that was his understanding and then by doing that then he could display his attributes cuz had in him an attribute to be a savior well there was nothing lost he had an attribute of being a Healer but there was nothing sick or nothing so he permitted the fall to come into being not causing it you can't say well God made me this way no no he didn't make us this way we are free moral agents we make ourselves the way we are you can't blame him for something that we do when we come to the age of a kind of ability we don't blame Adam and Eve for what happened Amen to you and I that started the ball rolling but yet you and I are the problem with the rest of it all right so then in doing that he could by permitting us to fall he could display those attributes all right then he could come forth and be what he desired to be as I said a savior A Healer and things he could do those things and we watched his attributes as they displayed down through the scriptures and we've seen that and came down to the end time to where we're at that we are to be talking about the full Plan of Redemption you know being redeemed all right and that one of his attributes was that he would display and that's what we want to talk about today for a little bit is I believe the greatest attribute that God has so that's that's my thought his greatest attribute is his grace amen all right Grace is the greatest attributes because without Grace there would have not been any other attribute right right amen he would have not been displaying anything else had he not knew and saw what would take place and I said he knew we would fall right all right but he already had the in mind what he was going to do so as quick as man fail he comes down to start restoring man or redeeming man or to bring man back whatever you want to use all right and to do that see he's displaying his greatest attribute which is Grace now it's not disgrace see that's what we look at we we had the old baptis Doctrine we called it disgrace cuz we said it don't make no difference what I do I'm saved anyway now that's disgrace that's that's going into the wrong form of of understanding uh Grace truly is unmar favor right but it is not just a garbage can to throw out and just say well you can just live the way you want to do whatever because you saved anyway well that just goes to prove you're not saved that's that's a good point you're just it's not even saved to start with see but Grace is a display of his attributes and like I said now all of his attributes then relates to Grace you know where it be Advocate uh Rose of Sharon L the valley bright and Morning Star Alpha and Omega whatever you want to call and do and Redeemer you know whatever is a part of displaying that attribute that he had within him right which was Grace that's the simple point I'm trying to make it to where we'll think about it to to think about Grace as it says here in the scripture that The Headstone would come crying Grace Grace unto it amen all right now The Headstone is coming crying Grace Grace but you know what we we better have the same understanding to display back toward him right amen all right see then it can't be just well it don't make no difference what I do you know no that's going into disgrace right amen all right that's putting us into the wrong category and that's not a display of his grace that's a display of our disgrace right amen because that's that's what we wind up being right you know in total disgrace but now what about a product called Grace you know how old is Grace well see if you listening to what I just said Grace came first amen amen Grace was in the thoughts of God's mind amen it is not a new doctrine or a new idea or it wasn't something that the Baptist came along and picked up the message of Grace and know tried to bring it out and and messed a lot of it up but still they done a good job best they could but see grace was before the world Amen because Grace now caused him to display those attributes all right so he knew we'd fall he knew he created man he put us in the garden give us a choice he knew we'd fall all right but see then he already knew what he was going to do right you you got to admit that that he if he's God if there is a God or whatever you want to talk about God and doing then see if your God is not strong enough to know before the world what would take place upon the Earth after we came into the Earth then what kind of a god do you have all right see then Grace is what God look down and I've always said he kind of I guess we call it had Amnesia you know because God can forgive and forget amen we can forgive maybe but we can't forget but he can forget it amen now so now that would have to be a product of his grace amen that he could know what was going to happen know what we was going to do but yet he could still bring us into being right and then as we fall see he could come to restore back the bringing all right now then in this day as Paul says we were on like Sunday there Wednesday see as Paul would be covering to the Romans that the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen right now because the world is waiting on its Master amen all right so then in doing that then God is waiting on you and I amen right to come to the position to believe who we are and what we're here for right amen if you uh ever thought about well what am I doing in the world you know well you're here for a reason cuz God does nothing without a reason so then he's put us here for a purpose all right we are the people that the Bible says the end of all things has come upon now if you don't believe you're end of the world then just get your newspaper and read a little bit and sit down with common sense and you'll find it out in a hurry what's going on around the world it's falling apart how long it'll take that's none of our business because it ain't into us to do that and what good would it do to know you know you would you'd be like the guy was that tell you about that got the newspaper fictitional story got a newspaper a day ahead of time you know and he was doing good because he could win the horse races he could he'd know what was going to happen every day but then one day he read the obituary and found out he died the day before so that would put us into a problem all right see there's no need of trying to figure out what's going on is to try to just be ready against that day the Bible says all right now we talk about things and putting it in a perspective of redemption so then Paul says to the Romans that you know the full Redemption is to come in sunship are the position of where that the children of God would realize who they are what they're doing here and we're here for a purpose amen all right we're here to bring about the end of all things right okay now so then why don't we believe that that and accept it to find ourselves in the word amen all right now so Grace being is older than the world Amen and he said he wrote our names in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world right amen so that would be Grace amen but that was because what we were looking at last night that God doesn't predestinate by his desires he PR destinat by his for knowledge so by his for knowledge he could look down through time and know that you would be here this morning and that's no nothing pulling over on him he knew we'd be here and he knew what we'd be doing this day and and all like that before the world or something's wrong with your God I'd trade it off and get me something else if it wouldn't you know if that wasn't right I'd find a God that was really understanding but see then he knows what we are and what we're doing all right and in doing it that Grace would produce the attribute right are you following me right amen see grace then would produce what would be needed all right so Mankind in the garden when he sinned what was needed it was needed that God come down and make a way to redeem the man that had fallen all right so then as he does he starts displaying that attribute that he made the atonement Grace came first amen all right and he made the atonement to where that we could accepted or rejected and gave us that right but he knew what was going to take place but see then he could display that by offering these sacrifices himself because remember Adam and Eve had sinned they had their own ways figured out and their own doings but when they did God had to come down and kill those animals and cover them with skin because it had to be a blood atonement right all right so then God displayed his attribute of grace before mankind there in the garden to the point that he made a way amen Right and started his Plan of Redemption amen all right and see then from from then on everything the point I want you to get is from the time of the garden and we talk about Grace then to me the whole Bible is Grace amen all right that's the grace of God Amen to you and I like the prophet of God said one day he said my whole makeup is grac am well that should be all of us now not disgrace disgrace is totally opposite from Grace Grace is the love of God that's been displayed amen disgrace is what we take and do with it mess it up all right but you see grace would have to said be the product and then we would talk about Hebrews 138 that it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday amen today amen amen and forever all right so then his whole makeup would be grace to you and I but what do we think about that do we think Grace is some new doctrine some idea somebody came up with or do we look back and see that it is actually the producing of the entire Bible everything in the Bible's Grace no no we got this year thing called the law well see the law was never intended to be brought now that may shock some to think that God wrote the law and but man chose law in Exodus 19 he said give us something to do and God brought a law into existence it was never his full intent to bring that law because you don't need law when you're under grace right see that's where we mess up by our own choosing right you said when I wasn't back there no we wouldn't back there but by our representation of them before us we wouldn't in the garden the fall but because the fall came it brought us under the fall agree all right see then they wanted law Israel did because they wanted something to do they couldn't be satisfied just being the people of God that's right so they wanted something to do give us a law all right but see they didn't get what they thought that's where I like the prophet in his definition of he said they didn't get what they wanted or thought about they thought they'd got a book of rules to make them right you don't do this you don't do that you don't do this tell us what to do but see it should have never been that way you know why because Grace provided them an atonement in the garden without a bunch of works I mean there's no you know plain language now you read your Bible there's nowhere in the Bible it says Adam and Eve even repented that's right right that's right come on I'm sure they did but it's not in the word they didn't come out repented they come out trying to figure everything out they came out with a fig Leaf gospel because once they found out what wrong they made them some coverage remember from the Fig leaves that's right all right you know see it wasn't they were trying to repent right it was trying to get around right or a Pease what they thought was an Angry God right well was God angry I'll let you think about it it don't sound like he was he was doing everything he could to cover the mankind so he didn't wind up with saying well I'm angry at you sure he's angry at sin right but he wasn't angry at the products right he didn't even curse Adam he didn't curse Eve he cursed the Earth and made it to things all right so then in doing that see he was trying to display his grace but what does mankind want something to do tuck him some fig leaves solded them together made them some close God said that won't work that's right take them clothes off throw them back over in the bushes get in the bushes and put these skins on because it had to be blood right amen because we know the story of what would happened in the garden it was blood and and it had to be blood to atone right amen but my point is to get you to think about Grace in a way that maybe uh you know there was no Grace in the law now we're going to go two points so listen there was no Grace in the law laws a policeman to put you in jail right so why in the world would they want a bunch of rules there's no Grace in the law right none whatsoever Paul said the law was added because of transgression and they sinned and they wanted something as I said about about the Fig leaves to try to appease God and they wanted some way of trying to satisfy God and they said well God give us some rules to keep yeah and they couldn't keep them and they didn't keep them n and we don't keep them right but you see it's trying to in some way appease right God don't want to be appeased he wants to be believed amen all right now then Grace now listen to what I'm saying there was no Grace in the law the law put you in jail he says you're guilty well why would you want that why would the children of Israel want a book of rules to keep right they just put them in jail Paul said that the knowledge of sin come because of the law because the law said Thou shalt not covet it just brought out into the open the man that thought he had something to satisfy God right that he could do it brought him more out in the open than it did to start with now listen to what I'm saying there's no Grace in the law right all right but there was Grace before the law during the law law and after the law that the way the prophet says it that's is called Paradox Grace was before the law during the law and after the law that sounds contradictory doesn't it where he's the one that says there's no Grace in the law it puts you in jail all right but see there's no Grace in the law it does that it condemns but during the time the law was in existence the grace of God was there right right amen so it's correct amen there's no Grace in the law but during the law before the law came into existence it was already Grace Grace came first it wasn't a law see you ask most people they say well to lock it no Grace came first right see the law was added because of the transgression of the mankind something he wanted but Grace had already provided what they needed amen right now so we think about it this way on one side you look at the and a prophet that was to be sent and from one side in one quoting of what you want you can see that a prophet is a sign of Destruction a prophet is a sign of the Judgment of God right right Noah being a prophet he was a sign of a coming judgment right all right but to his family and the animals and the Ark he was a sign of Deliverance so now which way do we want it when you got both sides to quote from and it's true to a nation to the nation of America this last day Prophet was a judgment sign right but to the bride of Christ what was he amen amen right are you following me Amen to the world in the days of Noah a prophet meant death judgment but at the same time the flood that destroyed the world was what Noah floated out on right amen so I'm sure his family liked the grace don't you amen and as I said the animals that was put in the ark brought over with him right but see can we get it together to H to bring it into the right order and that way we can quote one quote it says that there's no Grace in the law but then we can quote the other one that says during the time of the law Grace was there a Prophet was Grace to the people cuz that's the way they heard from God is that Amos 3 and 7 he does nothing does he reveals it to his servants a prophet so a prophet then is a sign of Destruction to one and a sign of Deliverance to the other amen all right and you know that he's Grace see the children of Israel needed a deliverer amen God could have sent down a pillar of fire he did but I mean I mean he could have just done it that way he could have went down there and Zapped everyone of the uh the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and and but that wasn't his way of doing it because you know why because that would have been for everybody right y but see it wasn't for everybody right amen come on I said it to start with then God didn't make us be what we are we made our choices we made our doings we've decided ourselves what we are we've made ourselves sinners right but see God's grace to Israel was a prophet you remember Samuel the prophet and they said make us a king he said what do you need a king for read your Bible what do you need a king for amen oh we want to be like the Nations around us well what did you need that far Samuel could stand up and say listen where did God ever fail to tell me what you have need of have not we W ever battle have not we have not God taken care of everything because a prophet then is a sign now this will be for later on when we get back to it isn't it odd now the first is is the the the typing of the Messiah which was you know the the atonement right I mean that that atonement back in Garden when it was made was typing Christ am which would be our savior Our Redeemer or all and all but isn't it odd that he started off and this is my thought he started off with allowing a prophet to come and that Prophet would be his grace right and then it odd he ends up with a prophet to come you know showing its Grace from the beginning all the way to the end amen right right are you listening when he first made his contact with a man he made the T that speaks of Christ but then immediately he comes through with Noah Enoch Etc the different ones as the prophets that the word of God come to and why would you want anything else I mean how would you feel if You' have been Moses and Moses was out there and they had no problems and you everything was running wonderful and people come along and say you know we want a law we want a book of rules go up there and find out we believe you would you just go find out what God wants us to do how would you feel I know what I'd have done I'd have got my coat and hat and headed back to the Wilderness you know what I mean right i' left them why because they were spitting in his face just like I said about Samuel give us a leader so what do you need a leader for I'm your leader but we want something ourselves you know what the prophet of God said about him the problem was he said God knew and they'd start bowing down and giving reverence and respect to those kings that it would be the same thing that would come on over later to the Catholic church and bow down and kiss the Pope's toe right or go up and and shake hands with the preacher and say you're saved yeah you know whatever see it would start the order of bowing worship God don't want no worship like that he wants worship from an honest and a contrite heart he doesn't want our rules and Dr regulations and our doings and things am he wants us to believe him all right are you are you getting my point see that we'd say well there was no Grace in the law there wasn't because it was what man chose it was not God's original plan to give that law what did he need a law for and like he said to you know Samuel went told him said listen what do you want a king for said don't you know he's going to start taking your your kids away from you and he's going to start taking the money away from you and he's going to have to have something to run all this stuff with you know just plain language and said he's going to start doing all these things and said ain't everything's running good down well I said he parted with mankind of not wanting to give them a law because they already had Grace what a dis disrespect to God could it be that he had told him there in Exodus 19 read it he said you're are chosen people you're a royal priesthood right say anything that you needed that I didn't get for you right I fought all your battles I've done everything I've taken care of you and you you want something to do well you know that's just Mankind we we just can't help it we just can't help to think about that God could save us without us doing something like we talking about last night maybe something we done or something we didn't do well God saved me because I I never did drink I I never did lie and steal that's the reason God saved me no that's what he needs to save us from thinking that we are something but but but brother Dale I just never was like them other people and maybe that's why God saved me well that's a self-righteous hypocrite I need to make it any stronger that's right the Bible says that our righteousness is what filthy rags in the sight of God so that would be really something wouldn't it no salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9 says it's not our works right but that's the hardest thing to get people to realize you mean brother Dale you don't want me to be good no I don't want you to be good I want you to get born again if you get born again you couldn't be no greater right and you don't have to worry about it then right we don't have a book of rules to live by talking to a man other day come up of course he wanted some money but you know and buming and then he want a question said about this sabbath and things you know and what the day is and I said sir I said we worship on Sunday the first day of the week I said your original Sabbath is Saturday the seventh day you know coming out of the Old Testament bring it down but I said we worship not as a commandment of any day but we wor as Worship On the first day of the week in honor of the Resurrection course it's kind of odd I guess me talking like that to him but I did get an opportunity to speak a little bit cost me 20 bucks but like I told him that's blood money you spend it on the wrong thing it's up to you you know but I said you know I said we worship in honor of the Resurrection we as Christians are not under a set Book of Rules yeah like but but but you don't think we ought to be good no I think we ought to be born again if we're born again we're going to live the life right right if you're not born again you're going to have a book of rules you're going to keep trying to figure out what you can do to be saved and I know I'm hard to say it and I'm hard when I speak and I speak crazy but you know those the Bible says that have done more wrong are easier to be saved may I paraphrase it they're easier to be saved than those self-righteous guys am brother brand said one day about those Pharisees he said it was hard to get them to realize they were lost where he could die for their sins to save them what about a people that's taught all of their life that they are the people of God they are the children of God they are all of the things cuz that's what the Jews believed and then Jesus said you must be born again there stood Grace in front of them trying its best to explain what they could do if they wanted to be righteous but it's like Nicodemus he couldn't understand it do we understand that or do we just hear the words I say it I you know I said it now three times I don't want you to be good right well don't you think people ought to be good I come on how carnal can you get now if you're born again it'll take care of it that's right abely because Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith the Son of God right all right see then it's not your goodness that saves you you just think about a group of people that Jesus was facing that he could not in no way now even him being God himself in human flesh he could not condemn those Pharisees because they were doing exactly what they were supposed to do and they were not doing what they were not supposed to do you know every how you say that they were right but he said your righteousness is no good what you need to do is get born again see church we are a product of his grace there's no Grace in trying to keep a book of rules the grace is in that let me die out to my thinking and accept Jesus Jesus Christ and let him live all right that's Grace as I said then look what it would start with and how many people wants to believe that God sent us a prophet right amen nobody wants to believe that yeah well if it started with a prophet what's the problem with it ending with one amen right now people don't have no trouble with it starting with one right oh they believe Moses they believe this they believe but what about ending up with a prophet to bring us the grace of God Amen see and to bring us to True understanding of Grace that it would not be disgrace amen but it would be the true revelation of God's grace extended unto us and let him provide the the uh preparation right he done it in the garden you don't see Adam and Eve that said while to go running around repenting and crying out before God no they was hiding in the bushes having church right it's back our fig leaves thought this covered up no it was God seeking after man Adam Where Art Thou well we look back there is Sovereign Grace will take over if we it just allow it and it'll become true Grace and true Grace will bring the word together right Grace will put the word together rules will never put it together quick as you get something figured out to make you good Devil's going to bring up something else you need to do right you think man I'm doing pretty good I went all this week and I ain't had no problems well you're just fixing to get it come that's that's where you going to dump it all over you but you see if Grace is unmerited favor then what could I do to be saved we were talking about it last night there in Romans where Paul said that even David in saying blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin that's in the scripture but do you mean that he won't impute sin to well well we're just we're just so wonderful we're such a great a bunch of people till he just don't count it no that the righteous or self-righteous hypocrite he even got to the bases even though he had instituted the the sacrifice right in the garden he instituted the sacrifice and them for to do it and they were to offer the lamb and he said my nostrils is full of stink right from smelling your offerings that you've made and he was one that told him to do it but it become just a halfhazard thing you know just go get your lamb Throw It Up Walk on back do what you want to do and that's the way they were doing but he said a man with an honest and a contrite heart is what I Look to right what was the difference in David and the rest when David done enough to be killed right you agree right he took his best Buddy's wife away from him he he done all kind of things he was a murderer he was ever garbage can you could think of but God looked down and said he's a man after my own heart you mean God's a murderer and a warmonger adulterous no no not exactly now but David had a sincere heart and even as it says in the scriptures you know on his way from the bed with B Sheba and what he had done wrong he's crying out Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation cuz he knew he didn't have any he he proved that because what he just done but he was crying out for a deliverer that's what God looks at because there's the Grace Grace is not given for future events remember the the day we were talking about that amen you can't claim Grace for future events Grace is for what happened in the past there will be future events that will require Grace and be given right we we know that but don't be like the Catholic and pay for your penants before you ever do it you know you can go down there and pay them 50 bucks and go out and kill somebody well you're already forgiven before youve done it I'm not throwing off on them that's their beliefs huh you said well I didn't never know about that well you just think a little bit and it'll come out but understand what I'm getting at if Grace provided a savior then Jesus Christ was going to have to come and the only way that that Grace could be displayed to you and I the way that God wanted it would mean that he would have to come and die we are the only religion where it's required that our God dies you ever thought about that there's no other religion in the world that requires that your God died but see our God had to die up on the cross but my God can't die oh go ahead Jesus Christ was almighty God in human flesh you agree that's right and he died on the tree am no that was just a Son of God see that's where we're still in Catholicism amen and still believe believe in the old doctrines he's either was God in human flesh or he lied because that's what the Bible says Emmanuel which is god with us so then you're making the word a li that's why we believe in one true and living God not the the denominational doctrine of God in free persons Blessed Trinity there's no such thing in the word that's right there's no word Trinity in the Bible whatsoever it's not even there you can't put it there but see God's grace required that he had to die right amen the only way he could display that Grace to You and I right was to die in our place all right and why can't we believe it that way right you know why can't we believe it's all Grace instead of saying well you know I've been doing pretty good this week I ain't lied but three times that's just about as comical as you can get with it right right but follow me what I'm saying the children of Israel was not searching after a prophet no more than Adam and Eve was repenting to get an atonement right they didn't repent to get an atonement the atonement came you're regardless all right cuz that's unmerited favor see if you do anything to Merit anything you can't call it Grace it it's some works you do all right but see then the children of Israel down in Egypt sure they wanted out but they wanted some uh probably some Supernatural way of doing something or or they would have been glad to accept Moses if Moses would have come riding in on a white horse you know I come to take over but instead you see a guy with a stick right they would have been glad to accepted a a great charger and so would have they done the same thing in the days of the Lord Jesus had he come riding in as a great warrior to destroy every Romans and take over but that's not God's way but God's way was to send them a prophet now I've got to quote in here somewhere but you know what a prophet is really a sign you know what it's a sign of Deliverance all kind but you know that a prophet is a sign that God is going to speak amen is that a simple point I quot in here from the prophet he said a prophet is a sign that God is going to speak well see we put it all on the prophet speaking that's good his lips was used his mouth was used his vocal cords but who was doing the speaking amen right you see a prophet is not made to speak his own words that's why even who was it uh the one back there that went against it you know bam he said I can't say nothing but what God tells me right because you know what he was a prophet right amen and see he could only speak what God told him to say if that ain't Grace I don't know what in the world would be right you know to think about that a person could be so yielded to God as bad as David was and the garbage can that he was in his life and all the things but yet he was speaking the first person read the Psalms his brother was reading read the Psalms and David cries out they pierc my hands and my feet the dog wagged at me and the just like he was the one hanging on the cross because he was a prophet right amen a prophet being a sign of Grace to the bride of Christ now are we back where we at so you won't lose it but to the world he's a judgment sign because things are fixing to go wrong when a prophet shows up right amen and even the prophets a lot of times don't understand you remember Jonah he didn't understand he done went down and told him God's going to destroy all of them and they repented he still wanted God to destroy all of them now you can't put him over in the New Testament with that right right that was just a judgment or thoughts of a prophet amen God had to straighten him out amen about his thinking what about Grace what about the love of God Amen the gra greatest attribute that God could ever have is to love mankind amen and to pass his grace on to us and allow us to see the truth what if God had not sent a prophet in the last days amen where would we be right amen but yet he kept his word just as he promised the children of Israel a deliverer like I said they wanted all kind of other things but he sent a little old Prophet down there with a stick in his hand and he said I've come down to deliver he said Pharaoh let my people go Pharaoh said who do you think you are I'm Pharaoh I keep them he said okie dokie we see you later but you remember one thing that I've always tried to get you to see about Pharaoh he did have a little sense even though his daddy was the guy in charge when Moses was there the first time that guy still remembered and he was afraid what AM of pharaoh you go up and tell him let my people go we're going to get out of here and he said who do you think you are I'll just have you killed uh he was afraid God put that fear in that man's heart because that man feared Moses might take over Egypt again you remember Moses was in charge of the military right right all the mites all of the things he taught the Egyptians he he was a great man and he run to the Wilderness and when he come back that Pharaoh thought boy I better be you know I better play around with this guy a little bit cuz he might just cause an Insurrection you know a coupe to take over cuz everybody remembered him you know the old ones but you see see he knew who it was inside of him that was talking to Pharaoh so he said Pharaoh let my people go God sent me down here now let us get out of here we'll leave you alone cuz he was Grace the children of Israel was not going to leave out of the law right law came in the wilderness right amen there was no law in Egypt right it was Grace well why can't we believe that there's no law today there is a law yeah let me say it this way there is a law there a law of love right right I don't serve God because that I'm afraid that he'll destroy me and throw me into hell I deserve it amen if he does I deserve every bit of it I serve him because I love him because of what he's done for me he saved me we were talking about it so much the other day about it you know brother green and US speaking you see I'm 74 years old I was raised up when we when we were poor I was raised up in old houses where you look through the wall and see the neighbor coming look through the floor and see the chickens and look through the roof and see the stars telling Zach the other day the grandson about it for breakfast a lot of times we may have a little uh biscuit and gravy and if we got anything sweet a lot of times we put sugar on the gravy because we didn't have nothing else my point I was born and raised in the hard times all right I go to these countries or been you know to Jamaica uh Philippines and Brazil and I see those poor old people but when I went to Jamaica the first time my mind clicked back hey this is 1950 I remember when they used to tie the fenders on with hay bailing wire and the only way you got to crank the car was to put a thing in and jerk it and if you was lucky you didn't get your arm broke or push it off a hill because we didn't have anything else right you tied everything together and done it well see I could look at that and say 1950 then I could come out of it thinking well these poor people they're 50 years behind right right and see you can't go there well the problem is you go there you're going to give away everything you got right first time I went went first class which means three pieces of luggage full as you can get all doing you know when I came back I had three pieces of luggage two of them sticking in one of them and didn't have a thing gave away everything I had my wife said did you give them your underclothes I said sure did I hope it washed them but I give away everything I had why cuz you're looking at that and to think about America the grace of God that has been extended to us in the natural to worth what we have you know that's why I that I I can't uh I can't judge on nothing but listen do you understand what I'm getting at to one group of people a prophet is a judgment but to the other group of people it means God is going to speak amen that's why it says in the Bible in the days of the voice of the seventh angel it doesn't say in the day when the seventh angel starts talking it's the voice of God right you and I have heard God's word the correct understanding by grace and not disgrace we know what it is to be the children of God Amen and to believe his promises but how many people reads brother R's message as a message of Grace right why is the preachers all they want to do is preach on high and Gress and close and come on that's what most of them preach on like sister was talking about where they came from they wouldn't allowed to wear open toed shoes you know well all right that's their belief I ain't got nothing against that but it ain't what the prophet T but that's their belief you go and believe what you want to I'm not against you for what you believe that way I'm against it for the point of thinking that something like that would make us righteous right right amen like my wife said so you mean an ugly old bunch of naughty old toes you know but that's somebody's idea well all right but that's not the word and just like I I said I haven't done it yet I generally do it year hey Christmas trees you want to put up one in your home put it up if you don't want to put it up in your home don't put it up that's your business but don't condemn the other person for doing what you don't think is right amen cuz you show me where there's any righteousness and all of those things I don't do it well then you're going to wind up like most of the brothers has done you know what they've done brother Brandon put up a Christmas tree that's been proven but you know what a lot of them preach well brother brandham was in another age so he could put up one but we're in this age now that puts you prophet in the wrong age what do you got you done lost yourself well brother so and so said that well I don't give a hoot that's right who said what if you put your your messenger in another age then you better get over that age where he's at right or bring him over where you're at or something amen the grace of God if you're getting anything out of the message the grace of God is God's truth he said You shall know the truth that's right you shall know of the grace of God the truth of God and it'll set you free am not to know about it or a book of rules am but to be able to say I'm a product of God's grace am Grace has made me what I am then that way we don't look down on each other you know we we we are what we are by the grace of God amen right why can't we believe it that way and see then Grace would be that God would send us a prophet to bring us the correct understanding of the word of God right amen because of he's a true prophet of God he can't bring nothing but Grace come on you're not listening he's a judgment sign to the world right in a judgment signed to the bride you you get in the wrong way we're done judge that a long time ago in ourselves right got that right that's why everybody thinks all brother random come to do was preach hir and dress and clothes that was already in the Bible that's right come on I'm old enough to remember when women didn't cut their hair when women didn't wear pants and women didn't wear makeup and women didn't do that I'm old enough to remember that oh that was just old grandma well I'm old enough to remember when they used to go out in the backyard at the church and go down in the woods the women would get down on their hands and knees in the woods and praying for their children they wouldn't worried about snakes and bugs and things but you see I'm just a a product of Grace that's what I am amen now if it turned out to be disgrace then I would went on the wrong side right right well I don't agree with you on this well that's all right I'm not trying to judge you or rule you I'm trying to preach about the Bible of what it is for grace and now that that Grace has been extended to you and I that God would send us a message to find out what we're supposed to be right amen right right well see a nation a people they see a prophet coming them old Pharisees they didn't like them prophets right they didn't like him Prophets they want undo them prophets because they knew that that Prophet was coming to the nation was judgment yes right but you know the little widow woman that had a dead baby she was sure looking for a prophet right she wanted the grace what about you and I am see to one group of people back there Moses was a deliverer to the other he was a sign of judgment now which one is it to you and I right yeah the Messiah the prophet said the voice of the sign he said a prophet was a sign that the Messiah was ready to speak John the Baptist right judgment signed to the world and Israel as a nation but to the little remnant of the children of Israel they was looking for the Messiah to come he stood out there and he said I'm not him but said he's going to follow me and said you just get prepared see he was a sign of Grace amen you ever notice there in the Bible read it sometimes you might enjoy it you ever noticed that John had disciples right and they was John's disciples but then one day he said now don't follow me no more go follow him right pointed to the real true Prophet that was to be in Grace God brings his word to pass and why can't we believe that that's his grace you know that America is under judgment right amen why because the prophet came to this nation right amen it's judgment 56 he said I don't pray for this America anymore but yet you hear him over later saying we need to pray for president so and so we didn't do he wasn't saying it like we think he was saying it what was he saying we can pray for people but there's no need of praying for America to turn around it's not going to do it so as a nation is gone amen but we pray for people people so that's what I said he said I don't pray for this nation anymore then he turned around said let's pray for the president said you know that that man they ought not have killed him so let's pray for his family and let's pray for the one to take over and you know but think about it God gives you and I an opportunity to believe in grace are works I'll end with that thought we can make it which one we want it if you think it's a book of rules I'm not telling you not to keep them I'm not going to tell you not to keep a book of rules if that's what you believe but I'm not not going to tell you to go out and live like the devil that Grace May abound either right cuz that Paul said that's where they think we say to let us sin that Grace May abound he said God forbid that's right I guess he got a little upset that day maybe he's like me sometimes you get a little upset you know and say things hard but I hope you get it from a Heart of Love anyway the words from my mouth might be different but just remember what I'm trying to do right what now Grace is the oldest thing that there is in the world we read in the Bible word that it talks about the Morning Star saying together the sons of God shouted for joy that wasn't people up in heaven we don't believe that I'd rather believe it's God looking down now and seeing us because your Prophet did say that when they saw salvation coming and there wasn't people back there we don't believe in that I'd rather bring it down here now right and think about this is where the morning Stars ought to be singing and the Sons and Daughters of God ought to be shouting for Joy is over the true understanding of Grace to where we can look at it and say The Headstone comes shouting crying Grace Grace unto it like I said to start with he's speaking to us but we need to speak back to him we need to take back to him what he's bringing to us and then there won't be no legalistic works there won't be your thoughts it'll all be in his grace the Bible is full of the grace of God we've been through that right you know it was Grace to the children of Israel to bring them out of Egypt it was Grace to provide a lamb in the garden it was Grace to bring Salvation to us but now what are we going to do with it cuz remember as he says Grace Grace we must say Grace Grace amen if he says Grace Grace and we say grace and works now what have we done we haven't said what he said let's take back to him what he says and I hope you won't forget this point because we'll pick it up later he began by sending a prophet that could tell us his thoughts right amen he ends by sending us a prophet that can tell us his thoughts if that ain't Grace I don't know what it is amazing grace why would it say there Grace Grace unto it you know what do you believe about Grace well I think it's all right me just do what I want to do cuz God saved me anyway that's disgrace I want to live for God because he Liv for me that's Grace I want to stand in that Grace and say thank you Lord I can look back through the Bible and I can see his grace as it appears yeah look back there and see what happened cuz you can't explain the word of God I that God would forbid and tell you not to marry a woman of ill refute and yet you wind up with Rahab the Harlot coming into a position in the children of Israel that even David would come out of that lineage you can't explain that you might as well forget it you can prop up all you want to you can't explain that but you know what it wouldn't for everybody my last Point what prophet's a judgment sign but to the people he's a sign of Grace now which side are we on right why is the people always wanting to down everything and holler and scream about what's happening in America and what's happening around the world no tell me about the love of God it won't take me out of here to learn who's going to be president and I won't do it but to learn about the grace of almighty God Amen and what he's bestowed upon me to allow me to hear the word is that what the Bible say the Bible say it's a blessing to those that can what just hear yes what about it let alone to be able to believe it but just to hear it well because it's Grace let's stand come on musicians what do you think about Grace who was it Dwight Moody you remember and he run out in the street and grab the first person and said do you know Grace and they thought he's talking about a person you know Grace who he said the grace of God God Amen it's always been the grace but we better believe we're products of his grace amen and leave it at that right what we got brother3 number 93 anybody have a need the altar is open the
