the other day and he sends greeting to all praise the Lord okay this afternoon we're just going to have a Bible study that okay just look at the Word of God and some quotations from the Prophet because I'm going to speak about strange spires afternoon strange spires we don't need any strange spire because we have the original fire with us today we will read from the Book of Leviticus chapter 9 verse 23 to 24 first 23 reads and Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people and there came fire there came a fire out from before the Lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces Leviticus chapter 10 verses 1 to 3 we read and made AB and a by who the sons of Aaron took either of them censors and put fire therein doesn't say where they got the fire but they put fire therein and put incense upon thereon and offered strange fire by because it's strange fire before the Lord he commanded them not and there went out from the Lord and devoured them there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died before the Lord then Moses said unto Aaron this is that the Lord spake saying I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before the people I will be glorified and Aaron held his peace these are the words of the Lord s pray Heavenly Father we ask once again that you come amongst us and give revelation father and give sense to your word this afternoon Lord if you talk about it and reach out to the needs you're needy a congregation this afternoon we want to thank you and give you a face forever in Jesus name we pray amen may be seated hallelujah so we find in in in Leviticus chapter 9 after this is the first time that they ever made a burnt sacrifice before the Lord you know in the tabernacle that they built in the wilderness and when Moses and Aaron came out they came out from there from the inner court and they were blessing the people as they were blessing the people like kind of probably telling them you know go in peace the Lord has blessed us and may the blessings of God be upon you and as they as they were saying that then fire the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people and there came fire out from before the Lord of course they have already prepared sacrifice prior to this on the altar and when fire came before the Lord it consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw that they shouted and fell on their faces we understand that God comes in the form of a pillar of fire God is a consuming fire and the reason it came in a supernatural way is to vindicate God's Word and vindicate the man he's using in this case Moses was the man is using an air on his brother became I was chosen to be the high priest hallelujah and and so after they built the tabernacle and started offering their sacrifices then came the pillar of fire and consumed it's it's like God was pleased with their sacrifice and came down and ate and consumed their sacrifices hallelujah but then in Leviticus Leviticus chapter 10 the next verse that we read there were two persons NIDA been a by who and this were sons of Levi you know they were commissioned to do the priestly work you know the two to prepare the sacrifices and the altar and the tabernacle for worship they were designated to do it um in numbers chapter three we we read verse two and four these are the names of the sons of Aaron these are Aaron Sun the very sons of the high priests made up the firstborn in a by who and Eleazar and Ithamar these are the names of the even the priests which were unlearned that these people are anointed whom he consecrated to minister in the priests office and need up in a by who died before the Lord when they offered strange fire before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai and they had no children meaning that was the end of their genealogy huh that was the end of their race this these people they were cut off from the face of the earth Halloween why because they offered strange fire we don't need any strange fire amongst us because we have the original fire in our meets the see faith sees what God wants done with God's Word that's what faith does to you God gives you faith and faith but ROM says is a revelation God gives you a revelation he does not only give you the word but it gives you a revelation of the word and faith is a revelation for you see faith sees what God's once done oh I hope this goes in but mom says it faith doesn't look at the present time it doesn't see this but faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly that's what faith does it says what God wants and what God's once then done and and faith operates through that hallelujah praise God in numbers chapter 16 verse 48 fire from the altar saved the nation that saved the saved Israel from the plague there was a plague because people started right racing up from amongst the congregation of Israel and they begin to tell Moses and Aaron you're lifting yourself up about the people you're putting too much on yourselves because the congregation is now holy we're all holy we're all children of God we don't have to listen to you in other words hallelujah and Moses said unto Aaron take a censer and put fire therein from the altar how this fire cramp came from the altar Aaron was instructed to get fire from the altar and put and put put on incense and go quickly into the congregation and make an atonement for them for days wrath ground out for the plague is begun now this happened and the congregation of people that wanted to worship God there wanting to worship God but they begin dying one by one you know you know what happened because they were sympathizing with Nathan Korah and a Byram you see I thought for me to comprehend it after God for the vindicated Moses and Aaron Moses to be an arrest messenger for their their to prop the prophet for their their day and after he made this from instructions God made instructions you stay the people that want to follow you stay with you and the ones that would like to follow Dayton and Korah and a Byram you stay with your tents and there was a separation made in the congregation of Israel and God just there was the the Bible says the ground clay under them there was there must have been a great earthquake and the ground crack and there was a and and the earth the Bible said swallowed the people a Byram and data named nathan in a barrel and all the people that followed that believed them they were saying you know not only Moses can preach they were the first came to thee people that were respected in the congregation people people who were learned were people who were who had wished them and they had influence in the people of Easter two hundred fifty fifty two hundred fifty princess were swayed by them and of course they're beginning to influence the other people into believing what they're saying you see I believe God chose certain people to lead his people God chose Israel no chose Moses I should say to lead his people out of Egypt and in the wilderness and into the Promised Land hallelujah so thousands of people died already swallowed by the earth but then the next morning if you read in your Bible the next morning people were sympathizing with the people that died and saying Moses killed these people Moses you killed the people of the Lord you know and they were murmuring they were sympathizing and that's when the the plague struck the people and people just started falling dead hallelujah and so Moses gave the instruction to take fire from the altar and put it on the instant and put incense and go quickly into the congregation and make an atonement that is what saved the people tens of thousands of people died because they sympathize with the wrong thing you see real revival glorifies God and throws the people in submission to a vindicated leadership this is the reason why fire comes down from heaven to start a real revival what I mean by that is that to show that the message the messages of the messenger was the truth and that he has accepted their service their ministry and that they have to come under the headship of this particular ministry will let me say that again real revival glorifies God and throws the people in submission to vidiq to a vindicated leadership 1st Kings chapter 18 verse 37 to 39 this was the showdown on mark Mount Carmel Elijah prayed hear me O Lord hear me that these people may know that thou art God and the doors turned there heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stone in the dust and licked up the water that was in this trench and when all the people saw it see the result they fell down again they failed down today their faces and they said the Lord he is God the Lord he is God this is true revival hallelujah the Ministry of Elijah brought real revival to the nation of Israel Jesus okay we understand that God manifests himself through a form of a fire hallelujah Moses met the burning bush Elijah and Ezekiel saw God in a form of fire Paul met the same on the road to Damascus and fire from God initially they lit the altar of the tabernacle you know the same thing happened when the Temple of Solomon was dedicated hallelujah the priests were commanded to keep the fire burning on the altar it is a sign of God's perpetual presence or the policy or the coming to make his abode in the temple God did not just come he came to stay he came in abode in his temple Alleluia fire came down also from the upper room at the beginning of the church to see every time they built something built a place of worship for God and dedicated it fire comes down and consumes the sacrifice o God always manifested himself by sending fire from heaven hallelujah so the mystical body that's the Church of Jesus Christ the first believers on the day of Pentecost they were gathered on the upper room they were dedicating themselves they were in one Accord even one spirit then fire from heaven once again came hallelujah and divided itself amongst the believers and tongues of fires stayed on each one of them and they began to be filled with the spirit and started speaking in tongues we know that is true God also lead the altar of the lead the altar of the temple second quranic chronicles chapter 7 verse 1 2 3 now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of glory of the Lord filled the house you see when the tabernacle was built fire came down and then Solomon built the temple then fire came down and consumed the sacrifices and then all the children of Esau saw that the fire came down the holy the glory of the Lord upon the house and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worship and praise the Lord saying for he is good and His mercy and do it forever you see it produces the same result the same effect on the people they bow down humbled UM's themselves down and recognize the power of Almighty God the presence of God amongst them and and gave him praise and worship hallelujah you see that's why it's our priestly duty to keep the fire burning so the priests were commanded to not let the fire from the altar go out you see that fire is now it's no ordinary fire it did not came it did not come from from matches or man-made no my maid operation it did not come from butane gas you know the fire came down heaven this is supernatural fire hallelujah Leviticus chapter 6 verse 12 to 13 and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it that's why this is the Commission Commission this is the commandment to the ministry is to keep the fire burning because the fire upon upon the altar shall be burning in it and it shall not be put out and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning they and they and the burnt offering in order upon it and he shall burn there on the fact of peace offerings and the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar it shall never go out it's important that the fire in the altar don't go out that's why it's the responsibility of the Levites the priests to keep the fire burning of course you understand about the seven golden candle sixth we call it candelabra or D there's what another team that's another name for it you may burn Lewis the seven menorah yes menorah menorah was in the table of showbread or in the sanctuary of the tabernacle and the temple you can see in the next illustration the next slide please oh okay that's the candlestick we read about it in Revelations one verse pub and also in Sakurai chapter four verse one two three it's represented fire comes from God and there must be oil in the in the lamp and it supplies oil to each and every branch which causes the the lamp every lamp there are seven of them to be burning of course we understand that the seven golden golden hundred six represent the seventh Church ages hallelujah here's what happened butter bottom says they lit one lamp and then picked it up and lit the other lamp and then set it down and lit this lamp and then took it lit this lamp with the same fire that's it they started at the beginning are you getting it the fire the original fire that came down from heaven lit the altar and from the altar the high priest would take fire and light the first lamp and then he picks up the second lamp and then lights it up again with the same fire that they started at the beginning but one said oh I hope you don't go over your head mother Brown is trying to show us something here this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same Holy Ghost lit every one of those churches light down through the ages when fire came down on the day of Pentecost hallelujah and that fire was never put out it continues amen to burn throughout the Seven Church ages hallelujah it is burning still in our church eggs hallelujah when brother Branham died in an accident the pillar of fire didn't die it's still burning it's still in the midst of the people hallelujah amen we don't need no other fire we don't need men man manufactured fire man made fire that's a fake fire that strange fire hallelujah we need the one the original supernatural fire that came down from God hallelujah notice better BAM said the same fire that burnt the oil there in Ephesus burned it in fat IRA the same fire burnt their burnt it in Pergamos burnt on down through to the through the Laodicean Church age as he says we're living in the same what the same Holy Spirit lit by the same God by the same fire and the fire that fell on Pentecost has lit the candle and the church through every age right on down now hallelujah oh I believe it I love the same pillar of fire has lit this church aids hallelujah of course gitarama in chapter 4 verse 23 to 24 says that God is a consuming fire let me read it to you take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of anything which the Lord God thy God had forbidden D for the LORD thy God is a consuming fire even a jealous fire who God wants God is asking for a full attention amen for our full worship hallelujah we are not to worship anything else but him he is a jealous God too he is a fire and it's a jealous God oh my goodness consuming fire and it's jealous Redemption by power I'll read a quote God gave them the pillar of fire to go before them I think they had a picture here tonight and I say it with reverence to my honest opinion while we're here in this group tonight I believe I believe that this is with us tonight this is what man is speaking this this picture of the pillar fire is with us tonight the same pillar of fire that let the children of israel is going before us you believe that I believe this with all my heart performing the same science and wonders and any teacher here or scholar the Bible knows that the angel that followed Israel guided them to the promised land and the was the Angel of the covenant which was Jesus Christ hallelujah so God Brown is slowly attending us the connection between the pillar of fire and this angel now God has provided a lamb Paul recognized who the fire was who the pillar of fire was just to see him standing there great pillar of fire he said I come from God I go to God he was the low gas that was with Moses in the wilderness say amen to that hallelujah he was the no gas that was with Moses in the wilderness the pillar of fire he died on Calvary he was raised again and then Saul was on his road to Damascus that same pillar fire struck him down he said who are you lord see Paul was learned in the scriptures and he knew very well that Lord eloheem appeared in a pillar of fire that's why when the pillar of fire met him on the road to Damascus he he fell fell from his horse and stuck the ground and said who are you lord he doesn't know his name but he called him Lord means Elohim I know your God but who are you of course the answer was I am Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new now there are people that come to tell us that their Jehovah is a different person from Jesus they're saying the Lord said unto my lord the lord is your OVA and my lord is jesus well that's nonsense to me that strange spire I don't see it in the Bible it's not in the message that strange spires hallelujah because Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new hallelujah and when Paul asked the pillar of fire who are you he said he answered I am Jesus whom thou persecutors next life there's a picture of the pillar of fire over brother Branham and then describe inspect this picture the healing of Jerry gyros a daughter he said but that camera won't take an optical illusion the light really struck the lens this is a scientific proof that the same pillar of fire that led the children of Israel which is none other than none other than Jesus Christ Himself was raised has raised from the dead in the form of the spirit and is with the church tonight moving on with the same signs and wonders I believe this with all my heart hallelujah so he described how this photograph was taken six shots were taken abettor venom and the six negatives turned out to be blank but the seventh showed a picture of the halo of light over brother MEMS head it's the same pillar of fire but the bottom said that led the children of Israel hallelujah now let's go back to the sons of Levi need up in a by who getting killed by the pillar fire what was their sin what was their sin they only wanted to serve God you know burnt incense before the altar and God killed them right there what was their sin God did not command them to offer incense at this particular moment of special visitation there was no command they just did it upon themselves you know and offered fire before the altar also they presume it would be okay to offer incense as they were anointed to perform the duties of priests they were supposed to be ministers in the Old Testament where ministers were supposed to do this offer incense and fire upon the altar they probably were moved by the overwhelming display of the presence of the Lord hallelujah they were calling attention to themselves in a time when everyone should be focused on what God is doing at the moment and should be worshipping and glorifying God in any service God should be the main focus all attention should be given come on hundred percent to him and him alone hallelujah any distraction hallelujah is a sin any destruction is strange Speier did I say they offered strange fire any form of fire apart from the one that originated from God cannot mingle with it strange fires are strange doctrines manufactured by men and that contaminates the power of God you see you can't be inventing your own duckling and mixing it with but what God has has to bring to us in our age hallelujah outside of the message I cannot take it outside of the Bible I cannot take it hallelujah wildfires are the slightest distraction from worship any form of irreverence hallelujah the slightest destruction from from the worship of God like your cell phones can be a distraction amen amen like your job can be a distraction hallelujah no you know you're willing to work overtime but you sit in church sleeping through the service the strange spire but yeah I don't do you and God doesn't want painted fire he wants the real fire the original fire God came from God but herb Adam says now you see you're putting on something that isn't real now you cannot get warm by a painted fire it was talking about the Pentecostal movement and it lingered on during his time you cannot get warm about a painted fire like some of this church is trying to paint Pentecost or something that happened a thousand years ago or 2,000 years ago you cannot get warm by a painted fire Pentecost is just as well today as it was then how can you become deck contented with painted fire when there is true eternal fire that comes from God I mean still burning hallelujah in the Church of God today hallelujah you cannot get warm by a painted fire Pentecost is just a field today as it was then see the fire is still falling it ain't a painted fire it's real fire from God Springs fires are manufactured or man-made fires these are historical or psychological or psychological or purely emotional revival strange spires is a safe self acclaimed ministry this is a military ministry that calls attention to cell you know I wonder about these ministers that that have halos in their photographs and put them on websites you know just to to to to to to make to make a claim that the same fire visited them it better be the same fire amen if not it's strange spire and if it's a calling attention to one's ministry to the person rather than the message to the to the preacher rather than Jesus Christ it's it's strange fire false teachings mixed with a pure word or man-made interpretation this is strange fire now we were commissioned in Revelations 10 to prophesy again which means we can only prophesy or preach what has already been preached we cannot add or take away from it hallelujah we already have thus saith the Lord this is strange fire is hypocritical godliness like what happened to Ananias and Sapphira they made the impression that they were all out in giving to the cause of the gospel they were actually rubbing the ministry think about it and God had to kill them show an example the third pole is not a public show and the angel actually rebuked brother Branham for being a show man you know first of all he was trying to explain how the first pole operated see these little bumps I'll hold your hand and I can see what's wrong with you would be the man and his bumps are moving in my hands and he was trying to explain to the people and SEC second poll came and he's saying the scene appears before me like on a screen you know and I see a woman becoming a little girl and then he tells people how it happens you know that God was showing him he was actually trying to explain everything and the angel said you explained the first pool the second pool you explained that you cannot explain the third pool there's no explaining the third pool hallelujah and when as he was preaching on the seventh seal and brother branham Sin City said I better stop I sense that he wants me to stop right here you cannot explain revelation I mean the third pool is Christ in you that's the greatest mystery the third pole is Christ in the closet of your heart Matthew 23 verse 27 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites scribes and Pharisees are serving the Lord trade they're claiming to be T to represent God for ye are like whited sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness you think God doesn't see it God sees every hypocrisy hypocritical action that we may 1st Peter chapter 3 verse Peter for whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning and the plaything of hair and a wearing of gold and are putting on her apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart see God is interested in looking at that what the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the Ormond of a meek and quiet spirit which in the sight of God is great or some great prize quiet spirit seems like American people are they are so hard for them to identify with that but God will produce quiet spirit in a person when that fire comes into you First Samuel chapter 16 verse 7 for the Lord see it not as a man see it for a man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart hallelujah baptism of the Holy Spirit by the Benham pump brakes on the holiness groups there then we are going to come over to the Armenian side he blasts the Calvinists and then he now comes to their minions and blast their meanings what did they get works that's the holiness groups works blessed God I let my hair go out the woman you know praise God I won't even wear a short sleeve skirt the man will and so forth like that that has nothing to do with the kingdom no sir you can let your hair grow long you can wear dresses whatever you want to or you can do this that or the other it won't help nothing to do at all to do with it you are not saved because of your clothes I want to read that again you are not saved because of your clothes if so God would just have made some patterns of such get a pattern and pass it to the sisters I'm thinking of the of the the amis people yet you talk about holiness and the manner of dressing in the lifestyle and they were able to maintain this kind of lifestyle for hundreds of years hallelujah God is not in it it's not the works hallelujah these people cannot work you hallelujah because they they dress holiday this the top holding the lifetime so little don't even have electricity sitting in this inside house any form of entertainment hallelujah hallelujah if God is looking to that well I just I'll just join the Amish country join the Mennonites but God doesn't look at that he's looking at the heart hallelujah Jesus God would just have made some patterns of thoughts and Jesus wouldn't have to die see you're not saved because of the clothes you're wearing you say because Jesus died for you hallelujah and we only do these things you know let our air our air out let our hair grow out you sisters because of appreciation you are saved because that God saved you by grace and you do these things just in appreciation you don't do it to be saved but you do it because you're saying hallelujah common decency will tell you that you do those things in appreciation works is what I do for God and may God help us not to take on this holier-than-thou attitude this bedroom said here you him you say I let my hair grow along but about him I want to look like a Christian who doesn't you all want to look like a question but if that isn't coming from the inside it will sooner about again it will never last hallelujah it will rub out again certainly it will you get that holier than thou art attitude that is wrong or help us but if the Spirit of Christ comes in and it will actually bring forth new life then it's not nothing legally anymore it's something that's in your heart that sprout forth these things you'll get away from the walls of these modern Babylon buildings that's fixing to fall anyhow but graham says Arminianism holiness is correct as long at this stage it stays in the Bible holiness I believe in holiness to Berta BAM said Bible as long as it's Bible holiness not your holiness but his holiness see and that is that is not my bit business I'm not depending on my holiness I have none not the part of God said this he had no holiness of himself I don't depend on my own holiness I have none but I'm wholly trusting in his holiness hallelu see it he's the one who did it not my works but his finished works that I rest assured that I have I was received into the beloved and when the beloved was asleep by God then God received me in Christ and that settles it amen I thank God that I can rest in what he did 2,000 years ago on the cross of Calvary hallelujah the result of wildfire or strange spires is death next life just like David organizing a great parade religious parade making a new car to carry the ark and cause the death of a sincere believer think about it what did David do he put together a nice mechanism a nice machine with spools on it and put the word on that machine when it's supposed to be the arch is supposed to be carried on staves amen bye-bye on the shoulders of the five fold of the the priest the five fold ministry above the heart of the people should be carried by ministers not put in a machine with spools are you understanding me they might be they might miss sincere but Birnbaum said they're sincerely wrong and by their acts sincere believers can die like Pusa was sincere sincere believer and God struck him dead and don't worship out of posterity just for looks God is not impressed by any form of performance we don't try to entertain outward wholeness means nothing to God mother he hates it he put critical holiness he hates it it should come from the inside should be his holiness showing forth on the outside him anytime one goes out of place and thus God the service outside of the will of God it's strange fire to God God hates it denominational system is out of the will of God and has resulted in spiritual death how many knows that Satan interpreted the word to Eve and the result was death high breathing only causes it only produces death hallelujah here I forgot to give God the glory the people thought that it was the voice of God speaking to them she was a learned man you know he can speak nicely before the people lets it read in Acts chapter 12 or 12 verse 21 to 23 and upon a set day he rod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them he made a speech hallelujah and the people gave them gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not a man and immediately look what happened watch what happened immediately the angel of God smote of the Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost he died right there and then next like the third pole is not a public show and watch he's always scriptural he said did not our Lord say when thou preyus be not like the hypocrites that like to wear to make a show said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door and pray to your father what that see it in secret and he that see it in secret shall reward thee openly he said I will meet you in there and this at this time it won't be a public public show that's this is what the angel of the Lord told Batman I will meet you in there in that closet in that wooden room hallelujah and this will not be a public show it's not for entertainment let's let's skip the scripture we are not to misconstrue the messengers message her mom said now we are in the evening time and the messengers down through the aides we find out at the beginning when a messenger was sent to misconstrue his word or to doubt one word it means total annihilation and eternal separation from God this is scary to misconstrue that messengers word that's why we need to be careful to only say what the tapes say listen may I say this right quick now even the visions that God gives me here the place it's so misunderstood that's the reason you hear me on the tape say say only what the tapes say say what the visions say and he said in church areas in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why light comes through the some given God given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger these spreads through the ministry over others who have been faithfully taught this is how God operates first it speaks to the main man and this messenger amen propagates the word to other other people other ministers who have been faithfully taught pray for me because every month we do a training session and our ministers fellowship every just first Tuesday of the month and initially it was intended for young ministers that come up in our own assembly but when I opened it up to other churches another ministers came ministers that are older than me ministers are more senior than me came to be to learn about the message because paradigm said you know gather the ministers and train them in the message that's what we need ministers that are in the message not in bible school not in manmade theology or psychology but trained in the message hallelujah but of course those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken it's important that this we speak only what the messenger has already spoken because after preaching the seals for eight days this is what the Prophet said now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages you think you're just reading a book or listening to a tape now these are the vision plus the word plus history plus the searcher changes and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding according to the Word of God and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord I mean after preaching the whole series on the seals it said everything the vision in history everything that is in this book is thus saith the Lord hallelujah god forbid that we take away from it or add from it no in our country people are afraid to evangelize with the message I wonder why that was but we have a special way of presenting the gospel of salvation its anointed I'm telling you it's anointed and it affects the people that hears the word will be presented hallelujah so we started the mr. Expo seminar we go right to the leaders and invite them for a whole day to listen to the presentation of the word and by God's grace out of this we have led close to a hundred churches these are denominational churches and these churches have come to embrace the message and they are now believing the message of the hour thank God hallelujah hallelujah pray for this effort because I'm I've been constantly shot by other ministers even in the message you know I get the people to come in the message in this denomination they use new group they forsake their old denominational ways and start preaching the message to them but once I get the people to to come in the churches they come in and mass as a whole church they come in then here comes the other ministers trying to convince the new group of people to listen to them they're not working for the same cause they're actually working contrary fighting the cause of God they say that the seven seals were Pittsburgh bearable but there are other seven seals on the back side of the book you have to go to them to know the revelation of these other seven seals that to me strange Speier if it's there there are more than one Lord a strange spire to me you preach that you have two souls strengths by there's a group that teaches that the seven thunders are seven men and you have to listen to this man in order for you to know when exactly the day the time and the and the hour that the lord should come on the strange fire hallelujah thank you Jesus now this messenger of Malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to do two things uh-huh what are these two things one according to Malachi for he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's two he will he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in this SILS and it will be this divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to our Pentecostal fathers hallelujah the seven thunders and then there's coming for seven mysterious thunders but mom said that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through these seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith amen you want to be in the rapture you need rapturing faith hallelujah you want to be healed you need healing faith that's what you need to be healed you want to be saved all you need is saving faith but if you want to be in the rapture you need to have rapturing faith in you hallelujah and this can only come to you through the seven thunders there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly you've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this earth the seven thunders are not seven set of doctrines I'm sorry seven thunders seven is God's number of completion and the breaking of the seven seals is God complete revelation of himself is that clear the seventh seal is the mystery that contains all the mysteries in the Bible it's an all-encompassing mystery revelation ten seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound then the mystery of God one minister said you see better well it says mystery not mysteries yes he was meaning he was telling me you see the mystery the word mystery there revelation 10 7 speaks about the Godhead he said that's the mystery that that that's been finished when brother Branham was here as he has declared to his servants the prophets but you see when brother branham explained it to explain it this way in the next slide Birnbaum says and be realized in the scriptures over in Malachi 4 there is to be one like John on Elijah to whom the Word of God can come to and he is to reveal by the Holy Spirit all the mysteries of God he interpreted it in this vague explain it to us in this way mystery of God's Spirit mystery one single mystery but Bertman said all the mysteries of God amen this is an all-encompassing mystery all mysteries in the Bible are hidden in this great mystery of Revelation 10 7 hallelujah this is the open book hallelujah that that that that John took from the hand of the angel you see see I think that's the problem when people try to take it from the hand of the seventh angel there's a problem he won't be under able to understand the message that open book you need to get it from the hand of the mighty angel hallelujah hallelujah because if you think of it even but when we cannot give you a revelation the person of brother Branham cannot give you a revelation only Jesus Christ can give you a revelation of the open book hallelujah to restore back all these mysteries that's been probed that program through denominational arrears hallelujah in rub in the message paradox he was Parabellum spoke about this this man who said that's after he spoke he said that's that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation let's let's look at it after speaking on the seed is not every the shop in Los Angeles California this man came up here put his arms around me I was going to say he said brother branham not to be sacrilegious but that could have made the 24 chap 23rd chapter of Revelation now humming knows there's no 23rd chapter of Revelation but this man was saying that can be added to the scriptures hallelujah you know another book added of course he said that wouldn't be right of course but we're not supposed to add anything to it and just as I started to say that he started speaking in tongues and the boy didn't know about speaking in tongues what it meant and here's another incident here well somebody was trying to catch brother branham next slide even brother Branham could not do it he couldn't add to it or take away from the word it taught me about the Bible now hallelujah remenham considers the Bible as his absolute hallelujah now someone has been many has been saying to me and theologian said brother Branham if the Lord God said if with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this that you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested now they were saying after observing Bertram's ministry then you are eligible to write a Bible yourself I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me and I'm said it was this guy was trying to catch me said I said but you see I couldn't do that what I couldn't do that I couldn't add to the word or take away from the word I need to stay with the Bible that's the Word of God hallelujah he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications Parabellum you have all the qualification you qualified to write the Bible yourself but I said but kill look one word cannot be added or taken away see better ban him the pillar of fire was upon him and it said this Alleluia but her Branham crossed all the wildfires hallelujah it's a wrong thought next line this is the wrong thought he said well then seven thunders you see said wouldn't them be seven thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a revelation given to some man this was the question better BAM said no sir it would be adding something or taking it or something away taking something away from it it's all revealed in there talking about the Bible it's all in the Bible it's all revealed in there hallelujah thank you Jesus it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was then it said he's still the word you see you cannot get out of that word it won't leave that word and God's Spirit will never leave that word it will stay right through the word blinding some and open the eyes of others it will always do that amen hallelujah do we have the word if we have the word it will still stood do the same thing blind the eyes of some even and give revelation to the others who give faith to the others hallelujah and hybridizing will always produce that next life and when the church today that's called themselves Pentecostal call themselves Baptists and whatever they want to when they hybrid this word with Dogma it produces a red child and she cannot have no life in her she's dead and her children is dead God said I'll throw her in a bed of worldliness and kill her children God said so in Revelation how many knows that's true because a hybrid person or a hybrid thing is a confused creature next next slide anything hybrid is off the real main beaten road we ought to have a little time to talk on the original scene see where it comes from hybrid don't know where it belongs it don't know who his Papa was who his mama was or nothing no he don't know he has no pedigree he can't have a pedigree he can never breed himself back that's why a Catholic will produce Catholic custom it converts and a Baptist person can produce Baptist people Pentecostal followers will produce Pentecostal people hallelujah but the Word of God will always produce sons and daughters of God hallelujah Amen hallelujah not the hybrid but an original gene that comes from God sons and daughters of God manifested on this earth in this age this is the last life hybrid people cannot breed themselves back hallelujah that's what the matter with the churches today they cannot breed themselves back they are a hybrid they don't know whether they belong to God or some denomination only things that they can produce is a member not a Christian I believe maybe I ought not to have said that but it's already said that's right he don't know what he belongs to he just knows that he's a Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal that's only knows what about some message believers some message believers that's the only thing they know is there part of the message movement I'm a message believer I'm part of the bride that's all you know that's all you know it's a hybrid religion it becomes just another brand you need to have the real experience the real fire coming upon your soul hallelujah and quickening that word into your heart to make you understand and clearly see what God intends for us to do the message came to give us rapturing faith to make us all ready for the rapture let us be certain let us know that we stick by it and not be trying to add our own concept our own interpretation our own tangents to the word but let's stick to the word what the messenger has given us in our aids because this is the only hope for the rapture you can you can have the wrapped you can help rapturing faith by going to about this church by listening to a catholic theology rapturing faith is in those tapes the messages of the hour amen thank you so much god bless you we don't want any strange spire behind this pulpit below one and it strains fire you want the real fire that comes from God and it's still here it's still burning oh god is still anointed people minister to picture the whole the two the two anointed word of the hour the word and and the fullness of the word and nothing but the truth hallelujah god bless you say Amen let's give our brother a good how much you appreciate these messages and what he stands for to try to not have no hybrid religion but we don't need that we need the genuine don't let's all stand together go right into her communion first Corinthians 11:23 I have received her the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus I'm not in which he would which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is an is broken in for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me where as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but a little man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep first we should would judge ourselves we should not be judged now that loved this part of the scripture but when we are judged see even if we're judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another anything any man hunger let him eat at home that you come out together and the condemnation the rest I said in order when I come let's just have a moment of silent prayer as we remember to pray one for another and in taking that little time to to remember each other and to Lord let the Lord this be with all of us amen
