[10:50] some of you i don't know where you're
[10:51] happy or not
[10:54] but maybe the lord will help us that's
[10:57] right
[10:57] we're not here to judge one another and
[11:00] uh
[11:01] you know you can't always tell by
[11:03] looking at somebody's face whether or
[11:04] not they're happy
[11:06] but uh we used to sing that little song
[11:09] but the musicians already gone so you
[11:11] can i'm not gonna call them back up here
[11:14] uh happy and you know it's amen
[11:19] amen thank you happy and you know and
[11:21] say amen
[11:23] if you're happy and you show it and then
[11:25] your i
[11:26] shall
[11:39] you know sometimes we're happy and we
[11:41] just don't know it
[11:44] uh i was thinking about philip
[11:48] he said lord if you just show us the way
[11:51] you know show us you say you're going
[11:53] away
[11:54] and so forth if you'll just show us the
[11:56] way you know
[11:57] he said i am the way right he said
[12:00] me you know and the way you know he that
[12:04] has seen me has seen the father
[12:06] me you know and the way you know exactly
[12:09] but you know philip didn't know that he
[12:10] knew right
[12:12] that's right so sometimes we can know
[12:15] and
[12:16] and just not uh realize that we know
[12:19] right
[12:19] exactly uh this is not a message quote
[12:22] but i think they say it's a
[12:24] something like a chinese proverb this
[12:26] comes to my heart so i'll share it with
[12:27] you before i let you be seated
[12:30] i think it goes something like this
[12:34] he who knows not
[12:38] and knows not that he knows not
[12:42] he's a fool shun him right yeah
[12:45] shun him right now he who
[12:50] knows not and knows that he knows not
[12:54] he's simple right yeah teach him yeah
[12:57] right he who knows
[13:00] and knows not that he knows is asleep
[13:06] wake him
[13:09] wake him he who knows and knows that he
[13:12] knows his wives
[13:13] follow him yeah that's right amen
[13:17] and the wise shall know their god amen
[13:20] amen
[13:21] let's bow our heads for word of prayer
[13:22] just before we read the word heavenly
[13:25] father we're thankful this morning that
[13:27] we can come with joy in our hearts

[13:55] lord a little uh maybe this is a little
[13:58] bondage or maybe just a little

[14:06] is happy and
[14:07] rejoicing we remember your servant and
[14:10] prophet's word how that

[20:07] physically
[20:08] i don't feel that great be honest with
[20:11] you
[20:13] i had a fall i shared a day a little bit
[20:15] earlier i didn't want to
[20:16] bring attention to it yesterday or
[20:18] anything don't want to today
[20:21] but uh just to give a little brief
[20:23] testimony
[20:24] wednesday of this past week last
[20:28] wednesday and i was due to
[20:29] minister some of the saints down in
[20:32] buford there and i was helping brother
[20:34] keith
[20:34] for the job uh it's a column of brick
[20:37] about
[20:38] six foot high i had to tiptoe to see the
[20:40] top of it
[20:41] and uh but a fellow backed into it
[20:44] messed it up it was the corner column of
[20:46] a
[20:47] kind of a pickpocket plantation there
[20:50] is a show house and uh where they have
[20:53] the tours and so forth
[20:55] and so he was under the gun and he asked
[20:57] me to come down and help a little bit
[20:58] and then to minister for him on
[20:59] wednesday night
[21:01] well i had the the brick replaced you
[21:04] know i chiseled out the bad ones and
[21:06] straightened up the pier and got it all
[21:08] sealed back and so forth and
[21:10] and up on top of this six foot high or
[21:13] so
[21:14] porch was a a rail a
[21:17] wood rail wood wooden rail and uh
[21:22] this last brick that i put in place i
[21:25] had to get up on top of the porch and
[21:27] bend over this rail
[21:29] to dress that put a little grout in it a
[21:32] little
[21:33] uh cement you know a little mortar just
[21:35] finishing it off you know and so forth
[21:38] but as i was leaning over that rail
[21:41] you know on top of the porch that whole
[21:44] ten foot section of rail gave away
[21:46] and man i go about i didn't die and i
[21:49] fell i
[21:50] fell there was no doubt you know it died
[21:53] it was kind of a control
[21:55] something there was no control but i'm
[21:57] glad the lord
[21:58] had control and i
[22:01] it could have broke my neck but i i got
[22:05] one little bitty um
[22:06] a quarter inch scratch and it didn't
[22:08] even draw the blood but just on my
[22:09] finger a little bit
[22:11] and oh lord i was reaching feeling for
[22:14] blood
[22:14] yes my glasses had broke a bit down and
[22:18] so forth and
[22:19] thrown off the side of my head and i
[22:21] thought my
[22:23] talk about jordan of life that it and uh
[22:28] i didn't break any bones you know and
[22:31] i'm so thankful for that
[22:34] i shook myself a little bit i crawled
[22:36] over i was there by myself
[22:37] uh under the shade of the truck it was
[22:40] hot that day
[22:41] and the sun shining and so i i just kind
[22:44] of recuperated a little bit and
[22:46] i just thanked the lord you know that
[22:48] nothing and but then
[22:50] i thought well i sure don't need me
[22:53] checking anything out further i went
[22:54] back to work
[22:56] and uh i was just almost finished i
[22:59] thought but then i had to work another
[23:00] two hours to replace that rail
[23:04] railing you know and so anyway
[23:08] uh then it was friday night then
[23:11] we have at our little home church uh
[23:14] which by the way for some of you who
[23:16] don't know me
[23:17] uh uh i pastor i pastored the same
[23:21] church this next year will be 40 years
[23:23] is a little church that brother branham
[23:25] was instrumental in helping us establish
[23:27] he come to colombia twice and
[23:31] then in in that brother arnett asked him
[23:33] in 1965 if we should start the work
[23:36] and so the work was started in 66
[23:40] and brother brown said yes get a
[23:42] building feel led to the lord
[23:44] follow the leading of the lord you know
[23:46] so we got the building in 66
[23:48] for iverson how many of you ever
[23:50] remember brother
[23:52] uh i think came out of the presbyterian
[23:55] church
[23:56] and uh he had was our first pastor
[24:00] and brother palmer had asked me to come
[24:03] down into this
[24:04] part of the country in those days
[24:05] brother dale i was supposedly
[24:07] you know kind of rumored to be at least
[24:10] the youngest preacher in the message
[24:13] now i'm almost the oldest not quite
[24:24] and he just turned 70.
[24:27] he just turned 70 right 71. six
[24:42] anyway next year will be 40 years i've
[24:44] been pastoring the same church
[24:46] it brother palmer had asked me to come
[24:48] down and speak for him over here in
[24:49] macon and then he took me on over to
[24:52] colombia my first time to be in columbia
[24:54] south carolina
[24:56] in 72 and then they after brother did
[24:59] resign they asked me to come back and
[25:01] pastor i said well
[25:02] i'll come and minister for you for a few
[25:05] months i ministered for him six months
[25:07] and then i said i'll give you
[25:07] opportunity to vote
[25:09] and that way it don't it's not a
[25:11] dictatorship you know it's a sovereignty
[25:13] of the local assembly
[25:15] well so i uh and believe it or not last
[25:18] two years i gave them an opportunity to
[25:19] vote again
[25:21] and they're still putting up with me and
[25:24] but by the grace of the lord now we have
[25:25] an associate pastor
[25:27] and i'm able to get out a little bit
[25:28] more and he's
[25:30] bearing the burden this morning at home
[25:33] and so
[25:33] uh gives me a little opportunity to do
[25:36] more missionary work and so forth too
[25:37] man
[25:38] so i want to say this to you before i
[25:40] forget it i appreciate the
[25:42] generous offering that you all gave me
[25:45] yesterday
[25:46] the lord richly bless you not only the
[25:47] church but the different ones that was
[25:49] here
[25:50] nice offering and i appreciate that but
[25:52] backing up now i'm going to use some of
[25:54] that cash probably
[25:56] to pay the the uh a chiropractor how
[25:59] many knows brother brown said the lord
[26:01] used his car crap
[26:05] i'm going a long way around my elbow to
[26:08] get back to my thumb
[26:10] my mind you know runs in circles
[26:13] but we have there in our home church we
[26:16] have one two
[26:17] three four
[26:20] four services a week two on sunday
[26:23] wednesday night uh ministering preaching
[26:25] and so forth as well three services
[26:27] preaching and then on every friday night
[26:29] we have a great big eight by ten screen
[26:32] that we pull down
[26:34] and we have the table and it's continued
[26:36] kicks and we have not only
[26:39] the words of the message but we hear the
[26:41] voice of the prophet
[26:43] amen and we come to hear that a tape
[26:46] every friday night
[26:47] and so this past friday night we was
[26:51] finishing up the third part of the
[26:53] invisible union
[26:55] and as i was sitting back toward the
[26:57] back
[26:58] and um when it comes to that was
[27:01] telephone hookup you know on that
[27:02] particular
[27:03] message and uh brother branham said now
[27:07] uh and it seemed like he was talking
[27:09] referring to the telephone hookup
[27:11] somebody out there he's making the altar
[27:13] call and so forth
[27:14] and there's a a pastor standing up with
[27:16] his hand
[27:17] up and that just somehow struck home
[27:20] with me i can't explain it but i stood
[27:23] up
[27:24] and i lifted my right hand and when i
[27:27] did
[27:29] i uh i i heard on
[27:34] you know what i i don't want to be a
[27:36] halfway christian you know
[27:38] there's a pastor with his hand up right

[29:15] the headship of the word and
[29:19] you forgive me maybe i started to say
[29:21] something didn't complete my
[29:22] thought but uh let's go right into the
[29:25] word of the lord now
[29:26] i'm not we're not here to talk about
[29:28] ourselves or our bruises
[29:31] i'm sure each one of you have bruises
[29:35] physically and probably some spiritual
[29:37] faces
[29:39] uh i enjoy induced a little bit earlier
[29:42] with
[29:42] brother dale and brother wade and then
[29:44] brother marlo
[29:46] and uh different ones and uh
[29:51] i tell you what it's hard for me to pull
[29:52] away from that good sweet fellowship
[29:55] you know but we have to concentrate on
[29:57] the word amen
[29:58] and uh you know
[30:02] faces of christ
[30:06] amen amen
[30:10] you know right brother brahman said that
[30:12] jeremiah was christ to the people of
[30:14] jesus christ
[30:15] amen didn't say it was jesus but christ
[30:18] means anointed one right
[30:19] amen moses was christ to the people of
[30:22] his day
[30:23] and today we must see that is christ in
[30:26] bright form right
[30:27] amen christ in you right no hope of
[30:30] glory
[30:31] amen that's right so then uh we
[30:34] want to remember brother black that the
[30:37] lord is
[30:38] uh calling us as individuals
[30:42] to represent him and here's a beautiful
[30:45] thing
[30:46] nobody period can take this is god's
[30:49] love to you
[30:50] nobody can take your place in the
[30:53] accompaniment that's right
[30:55] man sir i said nobody absolutely nobody
[30:59] can take your place in the economy of
[31:02] god god's got a place for you and the
[31:03] body of christ
[31:04] amen that's his love to you everybody
[31:07] nobody
[31:08] hey if you try to be somebody else who's
[31:09] going to be you all right
[31:12] amen right brother see somebody's got to
[31:15] be you that's right
[31:16] oh god and see now
[31:19] you all forgive me and i know you
[31:21] wouldn't know who i'm
[31:23] thinking about here when i say this but
[31:26] perhaps you've seen it yourself
[31:28] some preacher that'll get the maybe the
[31:31] pastor or some
[31:33] popular minister spirit of them come on
[31:36] and they act just like them
[31:40] sound just like them turn just like them
[31:42] or whatever you know
[31:43] right and all this happened said we need
[31:45] to get the holy ghost
[31:47] right not you know man's killers
[31:50] we get one another spirit sometimes
[31:52] instead of the holy spirit
[31:54] but we don't want that right we want the
[31:57] spirit of christ
[31:59] is that right amen and so
[32:04] may the lord help us we want to talk
[32:06] this morning about the headship
[32:08] of the word right amen amen right
[32:13] now remember luther
[32:16] see um
[32:19] back up just a little bit here we look
[32:21] at um
[32:23] daniel's vision or the king's vision and
[32:27] daniel you know
[32:28] interpreted it um he's seen this hint of
[32:31] gold
[32:32] right and then the
[32:35] rest of uh silver and then come on down
[32:38] to brass
[32:39] uh and then on down to the feet right
[32:42] of iron and clay satan kind of
[32:46] in reverse yeah but god builds his from
[32:49] the feet up
[32:49] all right amen and so we see the
[32:51] headship of the body now coming
[32:54] to uh the body right the church
[32:58] and uh luther wesley
[33:01] pentecost coming on up see from the feet
[33:04] right on that brother
[33:05] in one place said right and the last
[33:08] thing he said now we're in
[33:09] see it was the toms speaking and so
[33:12] forth
[33:12] and he said now we're in the seeing age
[33:14] see the seer
[33:16] amen all right but he said the last
[33:18] thing then to come into the church is
[33:20] what
[33:20] right the intelligence there's nothing
[33:24] moves above the eyes
[33:27] you can maybe wiggle your ears a little
[33:29] bit but your eyes in most cases a little
[33:31] bit higher than the ears if you're
[33:33] looking up
[33:34] all right you're looking down your ears
[33:36] might be higher
[33:37] all right but the last thing that moves
[33:38] in the body is the eyes that seem
[33:41] right right but in behind those seven
[33:44] horns
[33:46] and behind those seven eyes there's an
[33:50] intelligence
[33:56] and that handshape is coming
[33:59] right i'm quoting now from the message
[34:03] um christ the mystery of god revealed
[34:06] that's right
[34:07] in that glorious message oh to me that's
[34:09] one of the most powerful messages there
[34:11] is
[34:11] yes sir but in there he said the
[34:13] headship and the body has
[34:16] h.a.s become one unit all right man amen
[34:21] what's he saying say christ coming down
[34:24] time and eternity blended right right
[34:27] yesterday we stopped about
[34:28] we talked about god stopping time and i
[34:31] read four or five quotes to you
[34:33] where brother brown said god's reached
[34:35] his mighty hand out and stopped time
[34:37] right another place he said he's holding
[34:40] tight right right otherwise he said
[34:41] we're
[34:42] past time right and god is just waiting
[34:45] holding or until the church can get in
[34:48] their position
[34:48] right right amen black he stopped the
[34:52] sun
[34:52] so in that first ephesus joshua
[34:55] paralleling ephesians in the new
[34:57] testament they could get in there and
[34:58] take their inheritance
[35:00] get placed position adoption see
[35:03] now so today he's waiting for
[35:06] the adoption right to quit the
[35:08] redemption amen
[35:10] everything has to come out and you must
[35:12] know your place right
[35:13] your position in christ and
[35:16] let the headship of the word come into
[35:19] your heart
[35:21] the handship of the living word i
[35:24] believe in saint john 6 63 jesus said
[35:26] the words that i speak unto you
[35:28] they are spirit and they are light amen
[35:32] you cannot separate god from his word
[35:35] when he's in his word his word is
[35:38] anointed amen
[35:39] and the words that i speak they are
[35:42] spirit
[35:42] and their life we read the quote
[35:44] yesterday where he also said we're not
[35:46] feeding up on a man
[35:48] right exactly hallelujah that's right
[35:52] luther was the carcass for his day
[35:54] wesley was the carcass for his day the
[35:56] message they had right and so forth
[35:59] but at pentecost for their day but now
[36:01] see the full
[36:02] word the full body word of god is here
[36:06] right for rapturing faith and it brings
[36:09] the very intelligence of god in
[36:12] to the bride right amen amen all of us
[36:15] in god he poured into christ
[36:17] all that's in christ he pours into the
[36:20] bride
[36:20] not into one individual right but into
[36:22] the body and if we're feeding on the
[36:24] body word
[36:25] right that's it we're not feeding on a
[36:27] man but we're feeding on the body word
[36:30] of the son of man amen amen
[36:33] what was that what is that the carcass
[36:37] amen the body the latin word carcass
[36:40] you know like corpus christi right you
[36:43] know it's the body of christ
[36:45] all right then if it's the body word
[36:49] it's the word in the body
[36:52] and the government shall be were up on
[36:55] his shoulder
[36:56] all right family where is his body amen
[37:00] man
[37:01] hey where's the headset on the shoulders
[37:04] right right amen
[37:05] and his body is his earthly strength
[37:08] amen
[37:09] but now all that was in god he pours
[37:11] into christ so you
[37:12] must know that it's christ in bright
[37:15] form
[37:16] you must see the faces of christ you
[37:18] must discern the body of christ
[37:21] that's right amen amen all right
[37:24] we can't take communion properly until
[37:26] we deserve that right
[37:28] right you can't see because you're not
[37:30] communing you're not feeding right
[37:32] spiritual communion is when you
[37:34] recognize
[37:36] christ that's right there's earning the
[37:39] carcass
[37:40] discerning the word in body form right
[37:43] right amen
[37:43] see feeding on the body word right
[37:46] there's the true five-fold minister
[37:47] sorry man where's
[37:53] god took his man but not his spirit all
[37:54] right he took the major prophet but he
[37:56] didn't take the
[37:57] faithful ministry all right right amen
[38:00] right
[38:01] and he he took amen his servant
[38:04] because and he prophesied ahead of time
[38:07] he was going
[38:08] listen to the message shalom there he
[38:10] said when the music reached low
[38:13] in this great symphony and he said it
[38:16] freaks out the
[38:16] end of the life of william branham in
[38:19] this earth
[38:20] he said i'll go down with the music
[38:22] right yep yeah
[38:24] he said but it'll be high again right
[38:26] amen that's right
[38:27] i'll come up with the music right here
[38:31] amen yes sir and then how can i overcome
[38:33] at least the message there brother
[38:35] said they're more privileged than we are
[38:37] all right the ones who pass on brother
[38:39] dale right and go by the way the grave
[38:41] are privileged above the ones who are
[38:43] alive remain
[38:44] right we thought it was the other way
[38:46] around right but no
[38:48] they're privileged above the watcher
[38:50] library made for one thing they rest
[38:51] from all their labors
[38:53] and they're the first ones to come
[38:54] forward right there could be no rapture
[38:56] till there's a respect
[39:08] yesterday what difference does it make
[39:10] what time the rapture is going to take
[39:12] place right
[39:12] if you're not ready for it right amen
[39:15] so the main thing is be ready for the
[39:17] rest
[39:19] right second kings the the
[39:22] sons of the prophets plural not sons of
[39:25] the prophet singular
[39:26] right but the sons plural of the
[39:28] prophets plural right
[39:30] see all right they knew the very day
[39:33] that elijah was going to be raptured yep
[39:35] right sure and they tried to show it to
[39:38] elisha
[39:39] myself said i don't want to hear it i
[39:41] know that but you know i
[39:43] you know i want your revelation of it
[39:44] right right yeah
[39:46] they knew the very day that elisha was
[39:48] going to be raptured
[39:49] take it up no it's telling up my head's
[39:51] going to be taken from me this day
[39:53] they were in touch know something about
[39:56] the times
[39:57] right but they wasn't part of it right
[40:00] right
[40:00] they stood it far off and watched both
[40:02] elijah and elisha cross jordan yeah
[40:04] and they watched elisha come back right
[40:06] and they wanted to look for
[40:08] elijah even is it right we're looking
[40:11] for him in the mountains and so forth
[40:12] the revelation of the rapture was not
[40:14] perfect
[40:15] it was not complete even though they
[40:16] knew the day right
[40:18] man the more important thing is to be
[40:21] ready for it
[40:22] right you'll know the day when the day
[40:24] comes right
[40:26] true bro whole mind right lord help us
[40:29] right if we're under the headship of the
[40:31] word right
[40:32] man see now
[40:36] let me just um i'd like to try to blend
[40:40] this with yesterday's message if we
[40:42] could
[40:42] because it's a it's a blending of time
[40:45] and eternity yeah
[40:46] amen now god has reached out in stop
[40:49] time
[40:50] for what purpose why was the question
[40:53] yesterday why did he stop time
[40:55] right yesterday i believe we learned
[40:57] that it was
[40:58] for the readiness of the church waiting
[41:01] for
[41:02] us to as it was when he stopped the sun
[41:05] and the moon
[41:06] right in the days of joshua that first
[41:07] ephesus now where ephesus means
[41:09] beginning see
[41:10] we're going back to the beginning now
[41:11] right we've run the full cycle of the
[41:13] seven we're back
[41:14] to the uh eternity now right at eight
[41:17] amen
[41:18] when you receive the holy ghost you pass
[41:20] from time to time all right
[41:22] you stepped into that hey man you know
[41:24] absolutely
[41:25] there's no beginning you know right now
[41:28] what's time
[41:29] time is a loop perfect circle right
[41:33] now this is all time is this is a simple
[41:35] thing listen real close
[41:36] and i've got a quote right here but i'm
[41:38] just going to take and paraphrase it
[41:40] and you can get it from the message
[41:41] perfection 56 but brethren said time all
[41:44] time is
[41:45] is a perfect uh eternity's a perfect
[41:48] circle
[41:48] and time is a little loop right like a
[41:51] little hickey
[41:53] like a little loop in that side see
[41:54] you've got a perfect circle going like
[41:56] this all of a sudden there's a little
[41:57] loop down the bottom
[41:58] satan calls that yeah yeah so it calls
[42:01] it
[42:01] but jesus come down from time into
[42:04] eternity
[42:05] to make that blood streak back across
[42:07] that little hickey
[42:08] that little loop all right see
[42:11] oh praise the lord and he's here now
[42:16] amen to stop time right and blend time
[42:19] with eternity right
[42:20] right oh praise the lord thank you lord
[42:23] and god and his people now are blended
[42:25] together amen
[42:27] as time and eternity is blended right
[42:29] christ and his people right
[42:31] right our blend yes sir amen that's the
[42:34] that and the whole thing then is
[42:35] restored
[42:36] right amen the whole thing is being
[42:39] restored
[42:39] this is the age of restoration right
[42:41] right
[42:43] see it's a restoration and um
[42:48] um i'm gonna be referring to this
[42:51] message now
[42:52] um christ the mystery stay with me
[42:56] in there he said um
[43:02] christ the tree of life you know
[43:06] was made flesh right right let me back
[43:08] up just a little bit
[43:11] god's whole purpose before the
[43:12] foundation of the world was to share his
[43:14] eternal act with you
[43:16] amen yes sir that's god's whole purpose
[43:19] yeah right
[43:20] that's right
[43:27] uh you know what let me say it like this
[43:30] i have to be careful
[43:32] um how many ever sat down and enjoyed it
[43:34] nice steak
[43:36] or a nice meal i mean by yourself
[43:40] and you probably didn't have to watch
[43:42] your manner so much because you're just
[43:43] really enjoying it you know
[43:44] by yourself nobody's watching no cameras
[43:47] on you
[43:48] okay that's good you enjoyed it but
[43:50] whenever you can share that with your
[43:52] wife right all right
[43:54] or a friend that's right now that's real
[43:56] fellowship
[43:57] all right it tastes better doesn't it
[43:59] man that's right
[44:00] right what would life be if you was the
[44:02] only one who had like
[44:03] yeah right right what would like be if
[44:06] you was the only one who existed in the
[44:07] universe
[44:08] if you was just elohim let's say right
[44:10] come on right
[44:11] god's whole purpose of existence is huge
[44:15] family see what i'm saying spiritual
[44:19] save gene of god
[44:21] the whole picture is so simple it's god
[44:24] materializing himself glory man
[44:26] he couldn't think in terms of being any
[44:28] greater any higher he was already the
[44:29] highest
[44:30] he couldn't think in terms of ascending
[44:32] he was already the highest
[44:34] but he could only think in terms of
[44:35] condescending right all right
[44:37] coming down coming down becoming
[44:39] material see
[44:41] and that's when the word was made flesh
[44:43] right in christ amen
[44:44] he was the beginning of the creation
[44:46] what are we the continuation of the same
[44:48] creation
[44:53] right right god made you pay for your
[44:56] sins at calvary right right
[44:57] god had not yet separated from adam
[45:00] the bride from the groom at calvary
[45:10] brother put it like this god made you
[45:12] pay for your sins account
[45:14] right living he loved me dying he saved
[45:18] me
[45:18] buried he carried my sins and didn't
[45:21] have any of his own
[45:23] right right bro carried my sins forward
[45:28] now if god if he was cursed
[45:32] stay with me three times in the book of
[45:34] genesis the tree of life is mentioned
[45:36] three times in the book of revelation in
[45:38] all six places it's speaking of the
[45:39] person of jesus christ
[45:40] amen but that tree of life had to come
[45:43] down and be made flesh
[45:45] before god could share that eternal life
[45:48] and before man could truly protect
[45:50] the tree of life it was ordained of god
[45:53] that that tree of life
[45:54] be made flesh right now amen
[45:58] only through that channel could we be a
[46:00] partaker that's right
[46:02] my blood is drinking deep in my flesh
[46:05] right here's me indeed right
[46:08] right amen stay with me
[46:11] we've got five kingdoms as it were i
[46:14] know there's many offshoots from that
[46:16] different branches my five main kingdoms
[46:20] earthly um mineral kingdom
[46:24] the botany kingdom plant life trees
[46:26] grass etc flowers
[46:29] mineral kingdom the botany kingdom the
[46:31] animal kingdom
[46:32] right and then the kingdom of man
[46:35] yeah and then the kingdom of god right
[46:37] right let's just look at from that
[46:39] that standpoint for just a few moments
[46:41] here all right
[46:42] now look it always takes something from
[46:47] the higher kingdom to reach down into
[46:49] the lower kingdom
[46:50] to transform part of that lower kingdom
[46:52] into the higher kingdom right
[46:54] plant the acorn see a seed had to be
[46:58] planted in mother earth
[47:00] right mother earth didn't produce
[47:02] anything
[47:03] without seed right exactly but when the
[47:06] seed was planted
[47:07] we've got a great big old tree i can't
[47:10] reach maybe about halfway around that
[47:12] thing
[47:12] right beside our house somebody said er
[47:15] won't you cut that down so close to your
[47:16] house
[47:17] it's not real close it's about 15 feet
[47:19] away i said that's the reason i built
[47:21] the house here
[47:22] because of that nice oak tree right it's
[47:24] a good healthy tree right
[47:26] it produces shade it's an air
[47:28] conditioner itself you know and so forth
[47:30] and
[47:30] an atmosphere about it's it's a living
[47:32] entity
[47:33] right but see that stared at one little
[47:35] acorn
[47:37] hallelujah and that anchor taking a
[47:40] transformation
[47:42] living on the minerals transformed that
[47:45] mineral kingdom
[47:46] into the botany kingdom
[47:49] how did it become that big when it was
[47:51] all that big
[47:53] it was a transformation of pulling out
[47:55] of the lower kingdom into the higher
[47:57] kingdom amen
[47:58] look at the grass it feeds on the
[48:01] mineral kingdom
[48:02] and then the higher kingdom the animal
[48:05] kingdom comes down and eats the grass
[48:06] all right
[48:09] our kingdom reaching down to the lord
[48:11] kingdom pulling the grass
[48:13] or the deer loves the acorns you know
[48:15] and they'll take that into themselves
[48:17] and we come along then the higher
[48:18] kingdom and kills the deer
[48:20] right put it on the table or the beam
[48:22] right
[48:23] amen what is it the mineral kingdom
[48:26] the botany kingdom has to die something
[48:30] has to die every day for the higher
[48:31] kingdom to live
[48:32] right
[48:42] now as we eat the beef or the venison
[48:45] their
[48:46] uh mineral kingdom minerals and vitamins
[48:50] and everything
[48:51] and the botany kingdom seed is
[48:54] uh from the animal kingdom comes into
[48:57] the kingdom of man and we
[48:58] live by dead man right but now we come
[49:02] to a little dilemma
[49:04] try sitting down see in a number three
[49:07] wash tub
[49:08] and grab the bales and pick yourself up
[49:10] yeah
[49:11] or see if you can pick yourself up by
[49:13] your own bootstraps
[49:14] so it takes always a higher
[49:18] source to come down amen hallelujah
[49:21] everybody
[49:21] and god came down amen christ
[49:25] see god amen oh my all is in god
[49:29] right and him dwell dwelleth not just
[49:32] dead or will but
[49:33] now present tense to wealth glory all
[49:36] the fullness
[49:36] right and he is now in the black right
[49:39] right
[49:40] he's here he's here elijah's god is here
[49:42] he's with us today that's right now
[49:45] so we see that when he came down some 2
[49:47] 000 years ago and that word was made
[49:49] flesh
[49:51] to do away and bring a blood streak
[49:53] across that hickey of time
[49:55] yeah see time is actually
[49:59] like a perversion of eternity exactly
[50:01] it's exactly all it is just a little
[50:03] perversion of eternity
[50:05] but god comes to blend everything back
[50:07] in perfection
[50:08] right see now when christ came down then
[50:12] what was it it was the tree of life
[50:15] being made flesh but he had to be cursed
[50:18] right now that's a that's a cruel
[50:21] thought in a way
[50:22] the tree of life right the most precious
[50:25] person
[50:26] the most precious source the only source
[50:28] of eternal life
[50:29] had to be cursed right what was it when
[50:32] that tree of life was made flash they
[50:34] chopped him down hung him on a cruel
[50:37] roman tree right
[50:40] yeah curse this every man hate on the
[50:42] tree the bible says right
[50:44] now think about the tree of life for a
[50:46] moment being cursed because of god's
[50:48] love for you
[50:49] all right bro
[50:52] god thank you lord who is the tree of
[50:54] life amen become accursed
[50:57] what for to redeem us who were under the
[50:59] gospel under the curse
[51:01] right amen of the fall right right
[51:04] amen and under the curse of the law
[51:06] that's right and so forth
[51:08] all right but see now watch them with
[51:11] that
[51:12] oh my this is you will get this in the
[51:14] message crash the mystery brother that
[51:15] makes this statement and all i
[51:17] listen to it now i'm just going to
[51:19] paraphrase it instead of taking time to
[51:20] read it i've got it here
[51:22] but i'm just going to paraphrase you go
[51:24] listen to the message yourself
[51:25] right i think that's a good challenge
[51:27] right
[51:29] in this message brother branham says now
[51:31] then when he was
[51:33] uh this tree of life was cut down
[51:36] cursed hot on a uh roman cruel tree
[51:40] yeah see public shame
[51:44] strip naked then we see that through
[51:48] that he brings forth the bridegroom
[51:53] all right all right yes sir right
[51:56] god had to put the first ever sleep to
[51:58] bring the about right
[51:59] god had to put the second adam asleep
[52:01] right as we born the image of the
[52:03] earthly that was the first animal right
[52:04] this is in the image of the first animal
[52:07] that's why it's the diamond
[52:08] right yeah that's why death wars and sin
[52:12] even warriors remember right it wasn't
[52:14] your body got born again right
[52:16] it was your soul right man is that right
[52:19] right
[52:19] the body didn't change it was the soul
[52:21] that changed hallelujah
[52:23] that nature of the spirit had to be
[52:24] changed right hallelujah that old man
[52:27] has to die
[52:32] but we see how that when that tree of
[52:35] life was
[52:36] cursed amen he brings forth through that
[52:39] a bride tree which will
[52:42] be the tree of life restore
[52:46] right that's the prophet's words
[52:49] that's god's words to you i am the
[52:52] prophet right right
[52:54] now watch this real close the tree of
[52:56] life cursed
[52:58] see through that bringing forth the
[53:00] bride tree which
[53:01] will be the tree of life right restored
[53:04] right
[53:04] sure amen amen did you all ever stop to
[53:08] think about the tree of life
[53:09] needing restoration right yeah
[53:12] i didn't until i come to the light of
[53:14] this message exactly
[53:16] the tree of life in need of restoration
[53:19] right right do you know brother brahm
[53:21] said that we
[53:22] are leafs on the tree of life right did
[53:25] you know jesus said i'm the mind and
[53:27] you're the branches
[53:28] right amen did you know the whole
[53:31] purpose of the bride is to reproduce the
[53:33] group
[53:34] did you know we are fruit of the tree of
[53:38] life
[53:39] did you realize that we are the fruit
[53:43] of malachi 4. right yes and did you
[53:46] realize that malachi 4
[53:48] was exactly what david the prophet was
[53:51] prophesied about in the first
[53:52] psalm right the greatest thing you think
[53:56] to write about in the first thing that
[53:57] he could think to write about
[53:59] and the most precious thing was the tree
[54:01] of life
[54:03] oh yes and then
[54:06] his son solomon must have picked it up
[54:07] also because over at 11 30 he said
[54:10] the righteous the fruit of the righteous
[54:12] is a tree of life
[54:13] right right amen amen
[54:17] oh i'm going to say something all right

[54:32] in his season right
[54:35] that's right he said if you'll notice
[54:37] there's two jesus there yeah
[54:39] he said his fruit god's fruit in the
[54:41] season of the prophet exactly right
[54:44] he shall not see his leave shall not win

[54:50] fruit in his season
[54:53] oh my amen what is it it's a restoration
[54:57] time
[54:57] right right now all right right here we
[55:00] find
[55:01] ourselves right yeah see god no longer
[55:05] stop thinking about this just a moment i
[55:06] know you might think somebody i'm going
[55:08] in circles but just stop and think about
[55:09] this
[55:13] one place the prophet put it like this
[55:15] he said
[55:17] elijah now remember he took a rapture
[55:19] right yes
[55:20] enoch he took her after yeah enoch
[55:24] elijah even the great apostle paul never
[55:27] dreamed of the opportunities that we
[55:29] have today all right that's right
[55:32] brother glory amen
[55:34] all right enoch elijah
[55:37] even the great apostle paul never
[55:40] dreamed of the opportunities that we
[55:42] have today
[55:44] amen god's even stopped time for
[55:48] us yep right right waiting for us to
[55:50] recognize
[55:51] our opportunities and who we are amen
[55:55] who he is right what our
[55:58] responsibilities are
[55:59] right oh my god help us amen
[56:03] the handshape of the word is here
[56:06] exactly
[56:08] we have the answer to the devil's
[56:10] questions
[56:13] that's what the world is and the world
[56:15] counts the churches and everything's
[56:17] being formed for us right
[56:18] right to try to shut us up
[56:26] that's what the devil's howling about
[56:28] right that's why
[56:30] everything is happening the way it's
[56:32] happening because
[56:33] god has slipped down into satan's eating
[56:38] just like satan slipped down into god's
[56:40] eating right
[56:41] amen in the garden yep i am impregnated
[56:45] eve before the first adam can get to her
[56:47] yeah
[56:48] so likewise jesus christ has slipped
[56:51] down into satan's even after six
[56:53] thousand years
[56:54] impregnated a bride and under no
[56:57] circumstance at all can she be deceived
[56:59] right amen under no circumstance at all
[57:02] because the spiritual womb is sealed
[57:04] right
[57:05] man no other sin can take place
[57:08] right brother amen the head ship of the
[57:10] bro of christ coming
[57:12] to the church in an invincible union
[57:15] right

[57:17] which is the hemoglobin of god
[57:20] the pure all things are pure stay right
[57:22] right see i'm
[57:23] talking about the resurrecting christ
[57:27] becoming one with his church right amen
[57:28] amen
[57:29] him taking the preeminence all right
[57:32] amen
[57:34] somebody told napoleon one time said he
[57:36] was a little tired you know and they
[57:38] bring him into a table
[57:39] where he's going to feed him and and uh
[57:42] it's a long table because it's room for
[57:44] all his generals and you know his
[57:46] staff and so forth and uh
[57:49] they had a head chair set up there he
[57:51] got about middle of table sit down
[57:56] oh no uh bonaparte mr napoleon
[58:00] sir the head of the table is up here he
[58:03] said anywhere i said it's the hidden
[58:04] table
[58:06] right amen exactly anywhere on the side
[58:10] right yeah it's the head of the table
[58:12] all right and if christ is in you yeah
[58:15] wherever you sing
[58:16] that's right do you hear what i said see
[58:19] he's got the preeminence in you all
[58:22] right exactly you don't have to sit
[58:23] behind the table right you're not trying
[58:25] to lift yourself up all right
[58:27] he's he's got you in a position where
[58:30] he has the preeminence he's the
[58:32] preeminent one thank you lord see
[58:35] it's christ in you that's right not
[58:37] christ in somebody else
[58:39] his identification is always with you
[58:42] right
[58:43] oh brother sister glory when the devil
[58:45] tries to shut us up that's when god's
[58:47] going to take us out
[58:52] glory to god you ought to rejoice and
[58:54] look up because right and we see the
[58:56] squeeze coming now
[58:58] there might be uh some uh listeners
[59:01] sitting right in here
[59:02] from satan's eating right you know
[59:04] taking inventory
[59:06] they've got access to the internet or
[59:08] you know take recording whatever they
[59:10] yeah they know what we're talking about
[59:12] but they don't understand it okay
[59:14] man it's not for them all right all
[59:17] right
[59:18] they could understand they'd be part of
[59:20] they'd be fellowshipping yesterday
[59:22] they had fellowship in the mystery
[59:24] they'd be in here all with themselves
[59:26] they left
[59:27] this tree of life right let me feed on
[59:29] this tree of life right glory
[59:31] they're looking for it yeah they're
[59:33] trying to reverse old age
[59:35] yeah yeah that's right brother
[59:39] you know they're trying to spot the uh
[59:41] the atom and all this
[59:42] and then smash it and you know find that
[59:44] matter that you know right beginning of
[59:46] creation and what caused creation if
[59:48] they could ever tap into that
[59:49] but the devil cannot create nobody can
[59:52] only pervert
[59:53] right right but he sees now
[59:57] that in the ranks of the bride there is
[59:59] this creation because squirrels have
[1:00:01] been created right and he knows the
[1:00:03] power of the word to degree
[1:00:05] right he just don't understand this
[1:00:06] mystery right
[1:00:08] that's it amen
[1:00:12] brother man said he just don't
[1:00:13] understand it right that's it
[1:00:15] correct he don't know this secret
[1:00:17] exactly now there is a secret folks
[1:00:21] uh and this i think it's the same
[1:00:24] message i was referring to christ's
[1:00:26] mystery
[1:00:27] brother brown said he just don't
[1:00:28] understand it and uh
[1:00:30] he said now but
[1:00:34] it looks like a contradiction but where
[1:00:36] the contradiction
[1:00:38] appears to be that's where the
[1:00:39] revelation lies right amen
[1:00:44] where he says there's no secret that
[1:00:46] they can hide from thee right
[1:00:47] all right that was the covering chairman
[1:00:50] he was god's right-hand man to
[1:00:51] fellowship with
[1:00:52] he trafficked in true revelation right
[1:00:55] yeah sure
[1:00:56] he trafficked in true revelation but he
[1:00:58] was exalted above measure
[1:01:00] by the abundance of that revelation
[1:01:02] right see god allowed it
[1:01:04] but he wouldn't allow it with paul right
[1:01:06] and he wasn't right
[1:01:07] right
[1:01:15] but see now satan the bible says there's
[1:01:18] no secret that they
[1:01:20] can hide from me right commanding satan
[1:01:23] sure
[1:01:24] another place commending satan it says
[1:01:26] thou art wiser than daniel
[1:01:28] right that's right and daniel was found
[1:01:30] to be about
[1:01:31] seven nurses so times wiser than all of
[1:01:34] nebuchadnezzar's biases right exactly
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:37] but they aren't wiser than daniel right
[1:01:40] yeah
[1:01:41] but see there is no secret they can keep
[1:01:44] from being right
[1:01:45] but god can keep it from exactly amen
[1:01:48] that's right we don't have to keep the
[1:01:50] secret from the devil
[1:01:52] the lord has fixed it to her he just
[1:01:54] can't see it
[1:01:55] he'll make three gods out of them every
[1:01:56] time he is or two
[1:01:58] right yeah he can't see this mystery of
[1:02:01] christ
[1:02:02] revealed exactly he can't understand
[1:02:05] this tree of life
[1:02:06] right exactly
[1:02:10] oh brother now what was i i think we're
[1:02:13] supposed to be talking about
[1:02:14] the hit ship of the world yeah amen
[1:02:18] but i i know it's a long ways around but
[1:02:20] we're coming back to it see now
[1:02:22] here the higher kingdom always feeding
[1:02:25] on the lord kingdom
[1:02:26] but when it comes time now for
[1:02:30] christ the tree of life to come he
[1:02:32] doesn't kill
[1:02:33] and feed on the lord kingdom right he
[1:02:36] dies for the lord kingdom right amen
[1:02:38] right is that right the creator become
[1:02:42] part of his creation
[1:02:43] amen and then said except you
[1:02:47] eat my flesh and break my blood amen my
[1:02:50] meat is my flesh is meat indeed right
[1:02:53] my blood is drinking right now it's
[1:02:55] spiritual right he
[1:02:57] paid the supreme sacrifice
[1:03:00] and the blood cell of jehovah was broken
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] see lord form of life couldn't do it
[1:03:07] under the law they could offer a lamb
[1:03:09] but that lamb
[1:03:11] the life of that lamb could not come
[1:03:13] back upon the adulterer right
[1:03:14] even though he was forgiven to change
[1:03:16] his nature but now the higher form of
[1:03:19] life the holy ghost
[1:03:21] blood cell jehovah was broken right
[1:03:23] right
[1:03:24] wasn't the blood of a jew blessed in the
[1:03:26] blood of a gentile
[1:03:29] acts 20 28 says take heed to be the
[1:03:31] flock of god we're with the holy ghost
[1:03:32] that made the yours here right
[1:03:34] which god capital g.o.d had purchased
[1:03:37] with his own blood
[1:03:38] right amen amen the blood of god
[1:03:41] right and when the blood cell of jehovah
[1:03:43] was broken it
[1:03:44] loosed the life of that blood come back
[1:03:49] right and how does he do it through it
[1:03:51] by the word

[1:06:40] that a little bit naturally and so forth

[1:06:43] that's the same way you do it in the
[1:06:45] spirit right hey man
[1:06:47] i tried absolutely just feed on the
[1:06:49] right thing come on
[1:06:51] but you know what we're too busy sexting
[1:06:53] or texting

[1:06:57] doing this this is the text we need
[1:06:59] right here
[1:07:01] amen and uh right here if we get this
[1:07:04] text
[1:07:04] yeah yeah amen but everything satan's
[1:07:07] eating see they made everything so
[1:07:09] convenient
[1:07:10] for him to look at some television or
[1:07:13] something
[1:07:14] no wonder it's driving them insane right
[1:07:16] yes that's right brother amen
[1:07:18] i've already sell the member to turn the
[1:07:20] thing on even in the motel room or
[1:07:22] where we're visiting we went in
[1:07:23] yesterday evening and
[1:07:25] there was one in every room yeah the
[1:07:28] lord had provided us a nice
[1:07:29] room the church here didn't have to pay
[1:07:31] for it but this little north of here
[1:07:36] i better be
[1:07:41] a careful called hollywood
[1:07:44] don't you call me a hollywood television
[1:07:49] there you go but there was a television
[1:07:50] in every room yeah it's two bedrooms a
[1:07:53] nice kitchenette
[1:07:54] and it's condominium like it a good
[1:07:57] friend of ours provided it in
[1:07:59] so uh first thing i've done one of them
[1:08:02] had
[1:08:02] you know the fold the doors that fold
[1:08:04] over it kind of like entertainment doors
[1:08:05] you know
[1:08:06] and we folded those doors i went and got
[1:08:09] towels and covered up the other two
[1:08:11] but you're not even tempted to turn on
[1:08:13] for the news
[1:08:14] because if you're not careful when you
[1:08:16] turn i'm not
[1:08:17] trying to be legalistic now just i'm
[1:08:20] just saying be careful
[1:08:21] i'm not saying it's sad to watch the
[1:08:22] news or anything like that but i was up
[1:08:25] somewhere here sometime back and i
[1:08:27] turned it on and
[1:08:28] and something else looked a little
[1:08:29] interesting you know i thought well
[1:08:31] that's just kind of clean you know and
[1:08:32] i'll just
[1:08:32] you know and first thing you know man i
[1:08:35] spent an hour or so yeah yeah and then
[1:08:39] when i finally got the
[1:08:40] or maybe longer and i finally got it cut
[1:08:42] off anyway
[1:08:45] my mind is going in a circle now and i
[1:08:48] know all those things are just
[1:08:49] acting and putting on but it's in my
[1:08:51] mind and all those things that
[1:08:53] whatever you know even whenever you're
[1:08:55] going down the street
[1:08:56] you better turn your head and look at
[1:08:58] the cross right there because
[1:09:00] once you see something your mind takes a
[1:09:02] mental picture of it
[1:09:04] right and then you've got to have your
[1:09:06] mind sanctified
[1:09:07] right to melt all that stuff away
[1:09:10] it takes the blood of the lord and that
[1:09:14] thing no wonder brother

[1:14:49] god to us right now
[1:14:51] amen to god we've received a vindicated

[1:15:02] indication right as it was perfectly
[1:15:05] given and perfectly understood in the
[1:15:07] days of saint paul
[1:15:08] that's what he's restored what is it
[1:15:10] it's the mind of christ

[1:15:13] word right it's something you can hang
[1:15:15] your eternal destiny upon right
[1:15:17] right like i talked about that chain you
[1:15:19] know it's only strong since weakest link

[1:15:30] eternal destiny on this word
[1:15:32] it didn't come from man right it didn't
[1:15:34] come from the assemblies of god

[1:15:38] the churches it
[1:15:39] come from the mind of christ amen it's
[1:15:42] part of the plan of his redemption
[1:15:44] he stepped right down into time right

[1:16:10] quick right stop thinking about that i
[1:16:14] know that's strong meat
[1:16:15] but bride's time for brad recognize who
[1:16:17] she is
[1:16:20] right yep at nate calvary brother brown
[1:16:24] said the greater works he said
[1:16:25] can't you see that he said the greater
[1:16:27] works
[1:16:28] is to impart spiritual eternal life
[1:16:31] right
[1:16:32] that's the greater works think about
[1:16:34] this what's the brightness what's the
[1:16:36] bride to do reproduce the groom
[1:16:37] right now man how can you do it apart
[1:16:39] from receiving his seed
[1:16:41] that's right sure
[1:16:45] amen but when you rest now a lot of us
[1:16:49] here maybe we might need to go and adopt
[1:16:50] something if we can't produce nothing
[1:16:53] right brother brown said just get that
[1:16:55] adopted faith to start with that
[1:16:57] all right sure uh
[1:17:00] you can't now i'm speaking spiritually
[1:17:02] to the church not just to the
[1:17:03] ladies you know that can't have any
[1:17:05] children but brother ma'am said it's
[1:17:07] been proven
[1:17:07] then that if a mother can't conceive
[1:17:09] maybe she just got over anxiety and so
[1:17:11] forth she's going to do it so bad she
[1:17:12] you know and that's where we want to be
[1:17:14] we won't serve christ right
[1:17:16] we want to produce right what what god's
[1:17:18] called us to reproduce
[1:17:19] right all i just want to produce the
[1:17:22] life of christ
[1:17:23] holland's going to produce a christian
[1:17:25] without slaughter blemish
[1:17:27] but you can't do it oh exactly all right
[1:17:31] i said you can't do it all right but you
[1:17:33] can receive something right man that
[1:17:35] will do it right
[1:17:36] right you say oh it's hard brother
[1:17:38] hughes to live this message
[1:17:40] it's impossible right without christ
[1:17:43] right right
[1:17:45] it's not only hard yeah it's impossible
[1:17:48] right right
[1:17:48] but when you receive him right he's the
[1:17:50] overcomer and it don't matter what you
[1:17:52] got to overcome as long as you know how
[1:17:54] to overcome

[1:18:38] we're blooming and we're going through
[1:18:40] this right is it right and we're all
[1:18:42] connected
[1:18:42] to the tree of life right whoa
[1:18:46] ah we should love one another right

[1:18:56] here and upset you
[1:18:58] and boy i've got to get to my messaging
[1:19:04] my original text here that i take it of
[1:19:06] course it's the hitchhike of the word i
[1:19:07] want you to see this one thing right
[1:19:08] quick before we close
[1:19:09] okay yeah all right it's
[1:19:12] 10 minutes until 12. it's okay if we go
[1:19:14] 12. yeah
[1:19:16] all right now
[1:19:20] i certainly feel a real good spirit here
[1:19:22] a real freedom
[1:19:24] man so you know it's that when it's that
[1:19:27] way
[1:19:27] it's a pull right
[1:19:30] now we become common with one another
[1:19:32] when we rub shoulders with one another
[1:19:47] but let's look here just a moment at
[1:19:49] mary and john
[1:19:50] at the cross now let's look at mary
[1:19:54] yesterday we talked about
[1:19:57] mary having that responsibility to
[1:20:00] receive
[1:20:00] conceive give birth to nurse and bring
[1:20:04] that word to maturity
[1:20:05] right right and then i told you that
[1:20:07] each one of you have that same
[1:20:09] responsibility
[1:20:10] right you have the same responsibility
[1:20:12] that joseph had
[1:20:13] to bring that word provide for the word
[1:20:16] do you know that's what you're doing
[1:20:17] right here when you're obeying the
[1:20:19] simple message of coming
[1:20:21] and being faithful right not failing to
[1:20:25] attend church
[1:20:29] not forsaking the assembly of yourselves
[1:20:31] together you're faithful in your tithes
[1:20:33] your offerings your prayers
[1:20:35] did you know that's part of the
[1:20:36] intricate part of the program of god
[1:20:38] right
[1:20:39] these simple things going with the same
[1:20:40] simple message you said all right
[1:20:42] this was part of god's program or
[1:20:44] brother brown wouldn't have said
[1:20:45] everybody needs a church home
[1:20:46] right someplace where you go you call it
[1:20:48] your church yes sir
[1:20:50] is that right absolutely right and where
[1:20:51] you pay your tithes and your offerings
[1:20:53] you call it your church you support it
[1:20:55] with your prayers your attendance and so
[1:20:56] forth
[1:20:57] and your offerings well look here
[1:21:00] jesus believed in church order right
[1:21:05] he's the origin of church organization
[1:21:07] that's right he believed in the fivefold
[1:21:09] ministry he wouldn't have a ministry
[1:21:11] but he imparted his own ministry to the
[1:21:13] 12th yep
[1:21:14] after the 70 yeah and he ended up with
[1:21:16] 11 when it was all over
[1:21:18] but then he got paul to replace students
[1:21:20] is that right
[1:21:21] and all right we see now that 24 hours
[1:21:23] have to be there in their place
[1:21:25] right now but look here at
[1:21:28] john and mary at the cross jesus the
[1:21:31] headship of the word
[1:21:33] amen the lord of the harvest fixing to
[1:21:35] go away
[1:21:36] all right now mary
[1:21:40] had been responsible to bring that word
[1:21:42] to
[1:21:43] maturity but then she come also under
[1:21:46] the headship of that word right
[1:21:47] because here she is following the word
[1:21:52] all the way to the cross all right amen
[1:21:54] she and john
[1:21:56] made it to calvary right you can't have
[1:22:02] a mount transfiguration experience until
[1:22:05] you have a gethsemane and a mount
[1:22:07] calvary experience
[1:22:08] you've got to come to the cross first
[1:22:10] there's got to be a death
[1:22:12] before there can be a resurrection and a
[1:22:14] rapture right
[1:22:15] right and so here is mary and john at
[1:22:18] calvary
[1:22:19] hallelujah born again there's really
[1:22:22] been a change in me
[1:22:24] right out of glory born again just like
[1:22:26] jesus said
[1:22:28] born again all because of calvary
[1:22:32] oh i'm so glad so glad i've been born
[1:22:37] here they are
[1:22:38] calvary and we see
[1:22:42] jesus giving instructions to mary to get
[1:22:45] under the headship of
[1:22:46] john right right jesus
[1:22:49] didn't leave murray without hitship
[1:22:51] right right
[1:22:53] let me say this too brother in one place
[1:22:55] he said it's possible he's talking about
[1:22:57] the five full ministry it's possible for
[1:22:59] a man to have more than one of those
[1:23:00] gifts
[1:23:01] sure that's what he said all right now
[1:23:04] here we see the apostle john who's one
[1:23:06] of the 24 elders right
[1:23:07] that's right john's the apostle
[1:23:09] handpicked by jesus
[1:23:10] vindicated to be one of the 24 elders 12
[1:23:14] apostles 12 patriarchs right
[1:23:15] all right now yet we see that this same
[1:23:18] john
[1:23:20] become a pastor of the greatest church
[1:23:23] of the new testament
[1:23:24] right and he was also a scribe
[1:23:28] yeah is that right right right john
[1:23:31] pastored the church at ephesus
[1:23:34] the greatest new testament church there
[1:23:36] is one didn't need much correction
[1:23:38] all right man amen all right now look
[1:23:41] and we see then that when jesus here it
[1:23:44] is now listen close
[1:23:45] jesus put mary under the headship of
[1:23:48] john
[1:23:50] john led mary to the upper room
[1:23:53] amen exactly everybody
[1:23:56] mixing the clothes considering the end
[1:23:59] of their conversation the bible says
[1:24:01] listen closely right man said nothing
[1:24:03] all morning long get this
[1:24:06] listen close john
[1:24:09] led murray to the upper room where
[1:24:12] she received that same word
[1:24:16] that she had conceived some 33 years
[1:24:18] before
[1:24:19] he received it in his heart into her
[1:24:22] heart
[1:24:23] right right he is now with you he said
[1:24:25] but he shall be in you
[1:24:29] the word that she had once conceived in
[1:24:31] her world nourished and seen
[1:24:33] brought to maturity and crucified and
[1:24:37] ascended right condescended now right
[1:24:40] into her heart
[1:24:50] and then john took her with him to
[1:24:52] ephesus
[1:24:53] right a gentile church yeah
[1:24:56] took her out of jerusalem yeah took her
[1:24:59] out of nazareth
[1:25:01] joseph perhaps already died remember he
[1:25:02] was old whenever they got married when
[1:25:04] she was six to 17 years old
[1:25:06] he was already in his 40s brother said
[1:25:08] right so at the cross
[1:25:10] he was probably already he'd been
[1:25:11] whipped and he's 70 50 was still alive
[1:25:13] yeah
[1:25:14] but now he was one of the overcomers so
[1:25:17] uh
[1:25:17] nonetheless we see that under the
[1:25:19] handship of john
[1:25:21] mary ended up over
[1:25:24] in ephesus yeah and you know what she's
[1:25:26] doing
[1:25:29] she's doing the same thing she'd always
[1:25:30] done she was helped bring that word to
[1:25:33] maturity amen
[1:25:34] but she had transitioned from the john
[1:25:37] the baptist age
[1:25:38] and the law age now over into the age of
[1:25:41] grace and the baptism the holy ghost
[1:25:43] and now she's under the headship right
[1:25:45] under john right
[1:25:46] and they're working together to compile
[1:25:48] all of the epistles of paul
[1:25:51] and they're working together to take the
[1:25:54] uh
[1:25:55] gospels matthew mark and luke and
[1:25:57] compile them together in a canon of the
[1:25:59] scriptures
[1:26:00] and that's why that john was put on the
[1:26:02] isle of patmos for the word of god
[1:26:04] saying
[1:26:05] exactly the devil didn't want that word
[1:26:08] put in order
[1:26:11] but holy ghost amen you're still here
[1:26:14] putting the word in order
[1:26:17] hallelujah amen what is it it's the mind
[1:26:21] of christ and you
[1:26:22] right when you read the bible when you
[1:26:25] pray
[1:26:27] when you hear those tapes yeah the holy
[1:26:29] ghost is there
[1:26:30] right they put it in order for you yeah
[1:26:32] yeah oh
[1:26:34] is that okay figured out but god's
[1:26:36] already got it figured out you don't
[1:26:37] have to figure it out
[1:26:39] you believe it right glory to
[1:26:42] god what is it it's the headship of the
[1:26:44] word yes exactly
[1:26:46] there is a true church of the living
[1:26:48] goddess but
[1:26:50] she might be few hallelujah jesus said
[1:26:53] she would be
[1:26:54] here a little in there a little every
[1:26:56] kinder nation tongue tribe language and
[1:26:58] people
[1:26:58] right yep closing with this thought
[1:27:02] hear about
[1:27:05] about a month ago my son-in-law ben
[1:27:07] david
[1:27:09] i'd ask him if he'd go and help us
[1:27:10] because we had some youth meetings
[1:27:12] to minister down in uh arakipa
[1:27:15] way south of lima and uh one of the
[1:27:19] original inca
[1:27:21] from descendants from those incas had
[1:27:24] come and accepted the message
[1:27:26] and it invited me to come down and want
[1:27:28] me to come
[1:27:29] and so uh brother
[1:27:32] ben david was he prayed he felt led to
[1:27:34] the lord
[1:27:36] but see he had to meet me in lima i had
[1:27:38] to go through
[1:27:40] bogota in colombia and he was to make me
[1:27:42] a lima but so he's flying myself i
[1:27:44] picked up my interpreter down in
[1:27:46] um or our interpreter uh down in florida
[1:27:50] brother tony cepeda he goes for the
[1:27:53] keister chill
[1:27:53] some of you know him very outstanding
[1:27:56] you know real introvert and so anyway uh
[1:27:59] he's flying in the plane
[1:28:01] brother ben david is and he gets his
[1:28:03] testimony uh down in peru you know
[1:28:06] and so he said lord i i i i
[1:28:09] i know you know you're i feel as you're
[1:28:12] leading but i just like a little more
[1:28:14] confirmation
[1:28:16] and here he is and he looks in the the
[1:28:19] front
[1:28:20] of the seat okay and there's a uh
[1:28:23] in the back you know of the airplane
[1:28:25] seat in the front there
[1:28:27] where the fray table somebody talked
[1:28:28] about tracer right
[1:28:31] in behind there a little place where
[1:28:32] they carry the magazines and stuff and i
[1:28:34] think it was a safety instructions
[1:28:37] and
[1:28:40] in that it was
[1:28:43] rev it said that's what stood out to him
[1:28:46] he got his attention
[1:28:47] rev 10
[1:28:52] and um
[1:28:55] eight or eleven let me just see right
[1:28:58] quick what that is
[1:29:00] i don't wanna um
[1:29:03] but he said now i knew that was probably
[1:29:07] you know uh speaking about being revised
[1:29:10] rep you know it's a revised from maybe
[1:29:13] um 2010
[1:29:16] or something like that you know it's
[1:29:17] what that meant because it was the
[1:29:18] safety instructions of the airplane
[1:29:21] but he said bless strange seem like the
[1:29:24] lord might be
[1:29:25] in that so he got the he said i didn't
[1:29:28] even know there was a ten hey there are
[1:29:30] 10 11.
[1:29:31] i knew it was ten one through seven yeah
[1:29:33] yeah now he's a young minister you
[1:29:35] understand
[1:29:36] right so you don't have to have it all
[1:29:37] figured out that's right
[1:29:39] and uh here though he um he uh
[1:29:42] he goes to 10 then and it was 11 i think
[1:29:47] the yeah the 11th verse it was 10 11.
[1:29:50] listen to this
[1:29:52] and he said now he's wondering about
[1:29:54] whether or not he should go do this
[1:29:55] missionary work okay
[1:29:56] he still wants a confirmation he felt
[1:29:59] led to the lord he moved by faith
[1:30:00] right but he's wanting a little more
[1:30:02] confirmation sure this is his thoughts
[1:30:05] all right and so here the lord gives him
[1:30:07] this scripture then
[1:30:08] right in front of him you know you can't
[1:30:10] see nothing about that yeah
[1:30:11] all right and it's revelations 10 11.
[1:30:13] listen to this
[1:30:16] and he said unto me thou must
[1:30:20] prophesy again before many peoples
[1:30:23] and nations and tongues and kings
[1:30:27] amen amen amen
[1:30:30] and then he he got to study in the whole
[1:30:32] chapter then and a lot of that
[1:30:34] yeah and he realized hey right john
[1:30:38] wrote the book right and that was said
[1:30:40] to john
[1:30:41] john is the type of the bride and the
[1:30:42] american embryo
[1:30:44] the type of the rapture that's right yes
[1:30:46] sir
[1:30:51] what is it what do you say brother
[1:30:52] hughes revelation 10 1 was christ
[1:30:55] 10 7 was the prophet's ministry yeah but
[1:30:58] we have a ministry
[1:30:59] amen that's right
[1:31:02] the bride is a prophetic i'm not talking
[1:31:04] just to the five-fold ministry that's
[1:31:05] right but the bride herself
[1:31:07] is a prophetic class of people and the
[1:31:10] testimony of jesus christ
[1:31:12] is the spirit of prophecy that's right
[1:31:13] the bible declares
[1:31:15] that the testimony of jesus christ is
[1:31:17] the spirit of prophecy
[1:31:18] right when you're testifying about this
[1:31:20] message you're prophesying amen
[1:31:22] when you're given testimonies of what
[1:31:23] god has done in this day and what he
[1:31:25] is doing it's prophecy coming through
[1:31:28] you
[1:31:28] and through the bride and the prophet
[1:31:30] he'll confound the world
[1:31:32] right they can't receive it but it still
[1:31:34] has to be preached in
[1:31:35] every nation for a witness whether they
[1:31:37] receive it or not right it's got to go
[1:31:39] into our nation for a witness
[1:31:40] that's right didn't say all the nations
[1:31:42] would accept it right right up here in
[1:31:44] rutherford north carolina here some time
[1:31:46] back we had a great meeting
[1:31:47] and one of the brothers from india come
[1:31:49] up and uh his brother um
[1:31:51] i won't call the names but he said i
[1:31:53] speak the word
[1:31:55] for all of india to be saved
[1:32:00] it's okay to speak the word but you got
[1:32:01] to speak according to the word
[1:32:03] god didn't promise all india to be saved
[1:32:05] right right you understand what i'm
[1:32:07] saying right right
[1:32:09] so be careful
[1:32:13] as long as you're speaking one with the
[1:32:14] word you have a will right
[1:32:16] this is the word revealed will of god
[1:32:18] yeah
[1:32:19] all right i'm closing see and uh
[1:32:22] we must speak accordingly all right
[1:32:26] you can't go do your own thing
[1:32:29] but and only as he inspires you right
[1:32:32] according to what he's already confirmed
[1:32:33] right
[1:32:34] it's the word revealed will of god glory
[1:32:37] you understand
[1:32:38] not your mind or your imagination oh i'm
[1:32:40] going to do this i'm going to do that
[1:32:42] oh be careful now that's right brother
[1:32:43] man it's got to be
[1:32:45] under the direct leadership of the holy
[1:32:47] spirit the only way we'll know that is
[1:32:49] through prayer
[1:32:49] right right amen what's going on
