we're here it's just a great privilege that god has grant to us amen to be in his house many have passed and gone on over the past two years it's just a real troubling time but by god's grace we are here amen and we're still fighting the fight of faith holding on to our great salvation amen i'd like to bring you greetings from our church in lynn jamaica and um from the other ministers brother lewis brother walman brother brady um mccoy but the jonathan and different ones we greet you in jesus christ's name i've always tried to keep the unity of the brethren you know and um so i can have an open door everywhere because the same people you have here is the same people you'll spend eternity with so you might as well be able to live and get together and get along on this side amen you know i many times says we certainly have little differences really i don't know if there's anybody who i see eye to eye with on everything but by the grace of god we aim and have a perfect word that's a reflection really and by that we can thank god hallelujah that at least we can greet one another hug one another's neck and says i love you my brother amen praise god so we certainly thank god for that um the past two years have been really hard 2019 was a very active time for me you know um i remember the immigration officer was asking me he said why did you come to the states so many times 2019. i said if you look i was just transferring because i'm on my way to africa um i went to nigeria and on that trip to nigeria i went to uganda then i went to kenya back to uganda then back home then they invited me back to um uganda in december and i went to fort portal to preach that convention and by that convention it had opened the door and they wanted me back at easter time and uh so 2020 i had a ticket for easter and one week before i left home everywhere was shut down and um so it's a good thing i i didn't leave home i can imagine if i'd left home and got stuck somewhere i could just see francie's face crying for a husband but that's the way i am so i mean we thank god for everything really and so like for two years i i didn't do anything but stay home you know there were some times when i was the only person in the assemble but thank god we had learned to stream before the pandemic so you know we could continue what we're doing and we kind of help the others to set up in their local assembly you know to do the same thing really so you know we had all things in in common you know um so remember brother brady in your purse you know is short her memory is just really leaving him really and um this year is actually 84. so brother valman is actually valman clark is actually the pastor of the church there in farmtown because um one good thing with brother brady he accept that um his memory is going there's a lot of people whose memories start to go you've got to fight with them really because they think that you are sick and they are okay but he he accept it really and um you know he tell me he said brother keith i'll be talking to somebody here and i turn around and when i come back i said who is this because he don't remember who that is really or if you call him on the phone he say a few words and so and he passed on the phone he hangs it up really because he doesn't remember that he's under the call so you know but but it's a part of all ages just that demon really but um we we trust in god brother branham said you know man might be out of his mind you know but he's still got the holy ghost and still rapture ready amen because um this old man does not determine you know but when you are born again that tiapany man and one day that call you not with the glorified body what a change that's going to be amen praise god so we we thank god for these things really that how would we know them you know um it's not thought theology or bible school or so but god has sent us a voice in this day amen praise god and by that we we certainly thank god for who we are then on this trip i've gotta cut my stay in in the states short because i've got to go to canada because our house is empty these days because the girls have gone to canada to live and so um do we talk every day every single day many times for the day but i've not seen them in two years and i'll be going to to see them and so so they're excited and i'm excited to see them really and um the challenges we had during the covid it has changed our lifestyle totally and so now we've got a business that we've got to work on and um people are depending on us so we we can't travel together francine and myself and so but i was talking to her i said man i'll never travel without you because um sometimes the little things you know and um you know man i'll put on any pair of socks on any shirt if it's man you know what i mean but um she said that's a reflection of her so um but sometimes i do it to aggravate her really you know i i had my solid black pants and i put on a striped jacket and i said i know she's going to call me jesus so when she said jesus look at my husband [Laughter] so she she she gave me a note on my phone she said dear husband and this shirt goes with this really but i i don't always read it because i really don't want to even but we thank god for our families amen we thank god for the dearest to us really and so we thank god for the friendship we have amen you know um praise god amen i thank god for this church that has helped me over the years and wherever i go i tell them that um i had a teacher when i was in my youth brother sam deal and he's really helped me to with the opening of the world you know the way i think the way i i look at the scriptures you know it's because of that really because sometimes the focus is different everywhere you go some persons you know and sometimes in the message we you know you hear people preach and you know i could go back for my textbook in psychology or social psychology and that's just what you're saying but there's a word for the redeemed amen praise god and all of that's not going to get us out of here amen there's a church and there's a bride and i thank god the bride is elected to stand and she will stand upon the word amen so let us stand on our feet this morning uh it would be appropriate to sing you a song now to get you in tune but if i sing you might walk out so we might as well go on amen we've got so much singers back home i don't know why the lord didn't give me part of that really i would trade some of what i have but there's hardly anything i have really so i might as well stick with what i have in any case i'm going to read from genesis 1 26 to 28 in genesis 2 and if you find it then we're going to talk to the author of the word um as this is the kisha here known for a long time amen and we certainly treasure her in jamaica i thought she would have sing that song that i love amen but she didn't sing that this morning i can't hold back on him i've walked away from sin that's a beautiful song amen praise god so let's just bow our heads this morning our great god and father when i thank you god for this day you have given to us lord god we we we've caught up and we have lord because of friendship lord god we've said many things but lord god we pray that you're sending your anointing of the holy spirit oh god because lord god there's a need in your people's heart and lord god you promise that you'll speak to us by your word heavenly father we pray now that you'd come on the scene and lord god may you change the atmosphere take my thoughts and the lips that speak and lord god made you anoint and anoint the years that would hear it oh god and we we pray god that all that is in the hearing of my voice whether here or uh streaming from somewhere lord god we pray that oh god that will hear from you this morning because lord god there's nothing of us to present but lord god it is all of you christ the hope of glory bless us now as we look to you and believe you in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen you know um i was thinking that um maybe somebody might be somewhere and they hear me preach and a message and they said uh you know i but the kids preached this way or brother keith preached that way but i preach based on where i am amen and so i was just in south carolina at the tenth meeting i never used a quote i just preached from the scriptures and the inspiration of the holy spirit because we're preaching to people who have never heard you know we want to preach repentance and healing and deliverance really but to the bride of christ we change our thought and so this morning i'd like to speak on the abstract title deed amen in genesis 1 26-28 he said and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the ear and over the catalan over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created in him male and female created them so if god is a spirit then this man had to be a spirit man and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the year and over every living thing that move it upon the earth may the law that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated but then i'd follow with uh genesis 2 16 and 17 the bible says and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat thereof thou shall surely die so here god gave him dominion of the fish of the sea the fowl of the year over every living thing that move it upon the earth he had dominion he could speak and they would come they would obey him as a command but then god in genesis 2 god put a condition to that dominion he said you should not eat of this tree and i just want to bring you too quickly to the the covenant that god gave to abraham this covenant to adam was a covenant with a condition but to abram he gave him a covenant without condition i'm going to bless you you you know if you whether you leave the land whatever you do i'm going to bless you and i want you to know this morning that is a covenant of the bride an unconditional covenant amen but that's not where i'm going in genesis 3 and 17 and he said and adams and adam and to other me said because there was arcana to the voice of thy wife now no the fall comes in right there and as eaton of the tree of which i command thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curses the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and this shall it bring forth to thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field in the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dost the what and unto dust shalt thou return i'd like to also tell you that no you shall eat of it you shall by the sweat of your brow you're going to plant it's going to bring forth to you and you're going to eat but before that fall yeah dominion he could speak and it would create and he would take of the earth amen then to cap that off in revelation chapter 5 and verse 1. so now we have seen that the man had fallen and the the covenant was conditional so he had break the cut the condition of the covenant and now the dominion that he had he had lost that dominion and i saw in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside and it was sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven are in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there upon and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me we not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david as prevail to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof now here it is it would seem like these scriptures are not connected but that is why god had to send us a voice because what he did he took the bible and he break by revelation the word of god and gave it to you and i no no so he said when when adam fall in the garden of eden he lost the book of redemption and that book of redemption had the names of the redeemed but adam had no more dominion to call his children out of the earth so the book went back into the hands of the original owner almighty god so you take back that dominion from man and he took it to himself hallelujah so if god had it somebody had to be able to go back and to take that book now in revelation five you know no brother brahm said like this he said god does it then he reveal it then he brings it to pass now here john and the isle of patmos was now seeing things that was before things that are are and things that will be and so hallelujah in revelation chapter 5 he was seeing before the foundation of the earth that mad god had put man on the earth free moral agency and man fall and the book of redemption went back in the hands of god so god hallelujah made a way of provision for man and what john saw in symbol he said he saw a lamb and that lamb is as though it was slain before the foundation of the world which is a reflection of calvary when the price was paid so all that god is going to do in the mind of god it's already done so we say god does it then he reveal it then he brings it to pass amen and and so revelation 5 says that the lamb was worthy to take the book hallelujah amen they said when when the lamb take the book hallelujah all the hosts of heaven hallelujah cried out amen blessed and holy and power and glory unto the lamb amen praise god now let me say it like this really jesus's ministry you know it progresses you know what i said it's not because jesus had to be baptized because he was born almighty god but jesus walked a pattern to show you and i the pattern that we must go through amen he was identified at jordan he was baptized at jordan the holy ghost came like a dove and sat upon him not because he needed that but he's showing you amen then he went to mount transfiguration not because he had to but he's showing you the part of adoption are you there with me amen hallelujah glory to god why do i believe this message because i see the scripture being made manifested in the message isn't right hallelujah that god sent somebody who was without theology without knowledge of bible school everything take by revelation the word of god and break for the bread of life to you and die amen hallelujah so jesus he turned the water into one his first miracle at the marriage of canaan amen then to the woman of samaria he discerned the thoughts and the intents of her heart amen and then he said john 6 he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and the bible says and many were no longer with him they wanted the the water being turned into wine they accepted the discerning of the thoughts and the intents of their heart but when the word was made flesh that was right there before them they couldn't take that and so is it with the seventh angel messenger i mean they wanted the first pull of the healing revival all the churches had accepted it they wanted the discerning of the thoughts and the intents of the ark everybody had accepted that but when it comes to the opening of the word that was rejected amen hallelujah praise god so now in the in the sixth seal paragraph 127 he said that's the reason john wept so he's now talking about revelation chapter five because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone she just simply turned back to atom and molecules and so forth and cosmic light and not even the creator the creation person nothing else because adam lost the right to the book so when adam break the conditional covenant he lost claim on the book of redemption are you with me he forfeited when he listened to his wife she listened to satan's reasoning instead of the word of god it was forfeited then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore it went right back in the original owner like any abstract deed would do goes right back to its original owner and that was god the creator who made it and he hold it is that right listen there is no man that can redeem you is that right there's only one that can redeem you as the one that take the book in revelation chapter 5 the lamb and it's a bloody lamb is it right now you see god made a law and then god would keep his own law what a god we serve he could have done otherwise but he made a law and he kept that law so god made a law that if there was sin it had to be paid for by debt the wages of sin is dead amen hallelujah oh we could go to romans and look at all of that really now in revelation chapter 5 1961 he said now a kinsman is under the seven seal book of redemption from the original owner amen who's the original owner almighty god amen when we lost it in the garden of eden through adam it went back into the original owner but there's been a torture on the land there's quarter and that was satan and he comes over hallelujah he's a portrait of this earth don't belong to satan it belongs to god but he's a porcher as quarter man oh i could say something right there but i better not he said the title deed of our redemption the seven seal book it's the title deed so oh it's breaking forth to you and i you wait till we get to those seals so listen so in all the ministry of the prophet the seventh scene was drawing him up into the presence hallelujah of that open book and so listen it's not as though it wasn't there no it was always there but it progressed until it reached that point hallelujah so we we talk about now the title deed a title it is a proof of ownership it says who holds it now hallelujah and the deed hallelujah is actually the the document that declare what that title and all the boundaries i said of that title amen so now we we talk about land deed you you know and i remember one time in jamaica when you when you bought a car it had actually a little book and and that book tells you all of the owner of that vehicle from the first time it will landed on the island until no your name is placed there so you could go back and look all the persons that had it before you amen ah my now so but an abstract title it talks about the original owner amen so so this one that one that one that one but there's an original owner you know sometimes to all all laws you know if a piece of land is clear lay vacant for a number of years you can go into the government and you can pay up all the taxes that is owed and if it's over seven years you can put a claim on it and you can actually develop a title for that piece of land but you're not the original owner is that right somebody can come behind you with an original document and claim i've got an abstract on it is that right oh that's where your life is this morning satan has been a squatter you came into the world speaking lies hallelujah but somebody's got an abstract on your life satan you were not my original owner god almighty had put me here for a purpose and there's a purpose for your life but satan admire your life because he knows that god had a plan for you i tell you this one thing when satan know that god has a mark on your life he will do anything tomorrow that life hello if he'll send a young man a drug a a young woman who got to prostitute herself because she don't yet know who she is is it right but the word of god is to bring you back to who you are when you realize you're you're not the devil's child but god have a purpose and a plan for your life isn't right then you start to recognize who you are amen hallelujah jesus my my oh so satan might have you this morning but god has got the abstract on your life and the earlier you recognize it you you know satan you're a liar you're a liar i am not a failure i am not a defeat i'm a promise and i'm a possibility amen only the god has a purpose there is it right oh he said you are you are falling amnesia because you have you have lost your way somewhere but they said the cure for amnesia is to bring you back to familiar places hallelujah let you see where you were before hallelujah so how does an abstract is made you see this condensed form of a real property history typically only include a summary of the original grant subsequent changes in ownership and any incumbent on that property and finally a statement by the person preparing the abstract that it is complete and accurate hallelujah i bought you with a price oh hallelujah amen and there was a sacrifice that was paid for your life no i see the message like this really you know in the church book it said the messenger comes to do two things according to malachi 4 to turn the out of the children we are the children back to the original pentecostal fathers and secondly according to revelation 10 7 to reveal the mysteries that are contained within the seven seals which are the seven thunders amen praise god so now you notice up to 1962 december brother preacher message sir is this the sign of the end time and what he did he went back to amen you know he kind of summarized his whole life and that old ministry of jesus christ and then he began to talk about the mysteries that are being hid from ages and generation and what mystery did he go to he got to the mystery of water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ hey let me tell you the bible is not confused jesus said go into all the world and and preach the gospel and they that believe baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost but there's a heavenly name hallelujah there's a name and that name is the lord jesus christ so the disciples were not confused when when peter said on the day of pentecost baptize them in the name of the lord jesus for the remission of their sins and they shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen so he talked about the mystery of the godhead oh and what a great mystery that there's a god in three persons what idolatry when the bible said hear your israel the lord your god is one lord so it was bringing this hidden mystery no these hidden mystery were not all hidden they were churches that they believe these ones but they don't believe these ones they believe these ones but they don't believe these ones but god's bringing it people to perfection of himself where all the doctrines of the scripture has got to be identified in a people the people of god not some here and some there no no no but all of it really amen so he brought all those mistress together and so we take the whole council of god but with that we were restored malachi 4 but we weren't complete because there had to be something to take us out of here so i preached a message by coleman the hidden mystery and the mystery of redemption hallelujah because there were hidden mysteries that were restored under malachi 4 but there's a mystery of your redemption that is in the book of redemption hallelujah which contains revelation 10 from verse one to seven when he stepped down and when he sounded seven thunder hot of your voice and the prophet said now those seven thunder are the mysteries that are contained within the seals and that unlocks the mystery to take you out of here if we should believe all of that mystery that he speak of in december 1962 will be a great pentecostal church amen the gifts restored to the church and and all of that that we go on and teach psychology but there's more than that you see what the devil did to you he messed up your marriage you know in jamaica they said we we ain't got no marital problem because when people separate they poor people don't get divorced they just stay apart but but when she's got four or five children and there's five different fathers but she's never been married you got a big martial problem right there you see him saying because that first act was a marriage amen and so you've got a problem but you don't see it the devil has blinded your eyes and so satan is going to do everything to you to cause you not to be able to stand in confidence and find something and said ah i've been redeemed amen so something had to happen so moses had to go up on the mountain and meet god himself moses had to come down and look at the condition that they were in that it could never match the plan of god and moses had to take that authority by god himself that one i met upon the summit and released them of that curse that bind them and paul had to do the same thing brother branham he saw the condition but not until the seals were open then he could have taken that authority and what a great authority from god that says now that the clorox blood has been applied to your life and you've struck an abstract in god's word oh hallelujah amen they said ah but but uh but my mother and my father they were the key of my condemnation or they were never married so i said oh that act of adultery how could that be predestinated eternally so god had to take the clorox blood and put an abstract not in my mother and father he had to take me beyond that oh not too hard because adam had some problems with himself but he tamed me back to the mind of god and let me know that i'm an attribute of god [Applause] and all of god's attributes are perfect oh hallelujah how are you going to release me you're going to take me back to mind of god oh and that priest couldn't do it the bishops couldn't do it hallelujah they hadn't got the authority amen but god take his chosen man and say don't take the book oh and release them so he preached now that clorox blood hallelujah and he said that blood when it it's like the bleach hallelujah when it's dropped when you drop it into the ink it dispel everything of the you can't find it again it's gone hallelujah he was telling you who you are what a mystery but god gave the key hallelujah amen break forth the bread of life to you hallelujah that door you are guilty though every ordinance of this world were against you hallelujah when those seals were open and he preached that abstract title deed it was for a purpose to take you out of here that hallelujah that is not what my mama did hallelujah amen it's not what satan did in my life but it's what god did that's why that lamb hallelujah it was worthy to take back the book nobody could do it oh don't get it wrong brother branham never take that book no sir it was given to him it was already taken and open so he could preach your redemption hallelujah that tell me now when that seal is open and the clorox blood of jesus christ comes in effect and it gives me another title deed but he gives me that track and my record his search all the way back you can bring it back where you want it but he took it back into the mind of god and the bible declared to you and i whom you have for known they may also call and will be called they may justify them and will be justified then he also glorified what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us all of you songwriters said for my records clear today for rewash my sins away [Music] hallelujah glory we thank god for the opening of the word that is what brings my redemption amen adam couldn't do it no he lost that book there's no prophet no priest and all the blood that was slain on jewish altar it still could do it but jesus christ himself and he gave john oh hallelujah that peak beyond the curtain hallelujah he saw that the lamb was worthy oh for revelation 5 who is worthy who's were they to take the book why is the book important because the names of redeemed is right there in it hallelujah and if your name is closed up in the book you can't make amen the book has got to be open so may i say to you your names were written under the seals hallelujah so if the seal's not open oh are you going to have redemption you'll go around this mountain all the days of your life but you're locked in that chasm and you can't get out of it really because the blood is there to redeem you amen oh you see what i'm saying hallelujah so the breach between the church ages and the seals paragraph 116. he said the title deed to eternal life that's what it is not the church programs no no no not to be a member of a church but the title deed to eternal life and he said that abstract title deed to eternal life when adam forfeited for wisdom instead of faith it went back into the hands of of the whole almighty god what a great thing hallelujah amen in the hands of god waiting for redemption claim amen praise god he made a way hallelujah of redemption he made a way back and someday the redeemer is to take it back you see where we are getting to now we'll watch this fellow sitting on the throne waiting for redemption claim what is this book of redemption this title deed abstract title deed we don't just want to say title deed but the abstract title did it search all the way back to the original owner tell me which one of you this morning never came into this world speaking lies i don't care how religious your appearance is and some of you would like us though all the days of your life you are righteous you're a liar hallelujah amen a little chillax grandma said grandma where's your husband i ain't got none then how did you have my daddy ah there's a revelation there's something coming out begin to look through the realities of life something's wrong somewhere and something was wrong in your life how did you come into the world speaking lies then you ain't gonna teach no baby to lie no he'd hold the thing right behind him and you're seeing i said i got it god didn't do that no because he was born in sin in conception you might have been praying but still born in sin amen because it was born after the fall is that right and you're all born in that fall there's like oh there's no virgin birth you don't lie amen i don't care how religious you are amen so you're born in sin and shamed in iniquity are you coming to the world speaking lies oh david said in sin did my mother conceive me he said that means they weren't married no no no they were married but it's still in sin because if you even if you can't speak your children by the word then they're born by hallelujah sinful desires is that right amen so it's waiting for redemption claim what is this book a redemption it's a title deed that abstract titled it abstract what does that mean means it is searched all the way back to the beginning amen hallelujah is it like that little drop of ink this morning i preach that he says hallelujah these things are for a purpose there was a reason behind all of that it did not just pick something off the shelf and say i'm gonna preach this this morning no there was a purpose hallelujah and you were in that purpose by the drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed hallelujah and falling into the blood of jesus christ oh my it gives an abstract right straight back to the creator again when sin is confessed and going to the blood of jesus christ i say this to you now that when god gives you the seal of the holy ghost amen everything that you need until the day of your redemption is in you are you gonna have pitfalls yes are you still going to be truthful every day no you're going to lie sometimes amen you're going to be frustrated you're going to be sick all kinds of things is going to happen to this man but when you receive the holy ghost your soul is sealed hallelujah your soul is sealed but you're walking for this body's redemption and satan is doing everything with you to stop you but revelation take you out of here amen it's a revelation that is sealing you when you know that lord i got them struggles i pray and i never was recovered hallelujah lord i did this i did this but lord i repented because there's something inside of me that i can't sin i can't do wrong and and go to my bed and rest like a baby there's something in me that hey come on old man you got to send it right is that right hallelujah glory to god and because of that amen sin confess and put in the clorox blood of jesus christ it creates an abstract he said but brother king that was that abstract you see because god knows everything that you're going to have every revelation that god is going to reveal to you about you it's in the birth when you're born again you always was eternal amen you always was eternal hallelujah then the presence of the seventh seal the capstone is drawing you through experiences really oh hallelujah abraham god gave him at the start i'm going to bless you oh glory but but he had some pitfalls he carried lot he carried a whole lot of package with him that god didn't call but god let them drop off one by one and so he began to straighten up hallelujah so when the two angels went down to south the bible said abram stood yet in the presence of the lord amen he's going to test your faith to the final point is that right hallelujah amen glory to god yes sir abstract title deed is held in the hands of almighty god amen its redemption means all legal possession of all that was lost by adam and eve that all to make a born again christian hallelujah amen all legal possession to the abstract deed the title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve lost hallelujah and so god now oh my it's showing it to you so in the life of jesus in the life of a prophet he's showing you that you don't just come to the first and second pull but you heat the flesh of the son of man and you drink his blood amen and so in that third poll there is your salvation your healing resurrection dominion creation all that belongs to you brother there's just a little veil a little veil that is holding us back to call the dead ones from the grave hallelujah but we've got to get out of ourselves this is what's holding us amen but when god revealed to you all that he's going to restore to you then watch the redemption plan coming manifestation hallelujah identification 1964 he saw there was nothing in heaven that could have done you know john look the book there the bible oh and he said the book the bible because there's no secret book it's there in the word because he's a word hallelujah amen yes sir and we find that he saw there was no one up on earth that was worthy to take the book the book of redemption you see that's why the prophet said when the seals were opened the bible becomes a new book you know in my family i've got a lot of preachers i realize i've got nieces who are preachers my brother is a preacher you know and i listen to them preach and i'll see how they been trained by theology they take the word and what they do with it you know but i see how the book that we hope on the same book and though they open the pages the revelation of the book is close to them and they talk about trivial things and and so really because they they can't strike the abstract because they have never started out right amen they have never received that revelation now christ the minister of god reveal 5 24 now you see the seals when he was in the minitorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get his book this book that he's redeemed and all that's in the book would be him hallelujah amen all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the word in the book and the word is him you are christ christ in you is a hope of glory hallelujah he comes forth from this book of redemption whose names are are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb that john showed you in revelation chapter five you come forth when he opened that book there was your redemption you weren't born yet but that can't stop you so you see we are putting focus on people because they they were there with the prophet they know the prophet they they said ah the prophet tell me something that he never tell nobody will keep it amen because don't think that make you anything because here here's the book and this book is going to be open to you and i is that right also we're looking at this one and that one and that one and and before when the prophet leave of the scene what was there was the acts of the prophet because we were still blinded and those who sit there when he preached the seal they were still blinded to what he was saying but the word of god cannot return to a void it must accomplish what god pleased so you have to stay there until you realize it's not what he go to haunt it's not the little things he talk about no that's just an attraction but the word that he declared to you it contained your redemption [Applause] hallelujah listen you know people look at things and try to prove this today and prove that you cannot prove spiritual things with scientifical means it will never come out for when the doctors say you've got that problem and you're going to live three months by the inspiration of the holy ghost as dumb as i am i take the holy ghost and i tell you you shall live tell the doctor though look again because it's going to be different next time amen i serve a god who can call back the dead let the doctor explain that to me amen who can take cells in your body that is corrupted they call it tumor cancer and speak to them and they're gone let the science explain that oh they say can't be but i tell you it is go check again amen because god has more power than what you think amen he's restoring the world back to us and brethren let me tell don't get called and formal because with the restoration of the world he said it's a restoration of the power and you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you i'll say this though we're not the only people that manifest the power of the holy ghost but it doesn't matter how much manifestation you have if you ain't got this word you cannot unlock your redemption to the abstract amen that's what makes the bride different from all of the church amen that i said ah well you know everybody's going to make it everybody if you just have love everybody's going to make it you're going to make the rapture no because the one that went up in the rapture you've got to be in him hallelujah it's the rising of the sun page 65 paragraph 246 like the pentecostal experience today and the coming of the holy spirit holy ghost in the last day as promised it's like the abstract to the title deed now you can get a title you can get a a title to a place but that still don't say that it's yours no sir somebody may back yonder could have come in and and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off plumb back to the foundation and so that's what the bride need this morning we need an abstract that everything that you have ever committed hallelujah you see satan they accuse of the brethren so he comes up and he said uh where dale there was one time he backslid you know that's the truth and so he's pointing it in the face of jesus christ you know you drink you you you know you do this you know you did that hallelujah he said ah that's when you had him that's when you had him hallelujah but take him beyond that hallelujah so they said when he said oh let there be who was he talking with i was a part of his attribute and notice in genesis one he said and let them before eve was taken out of adam hallelujah because oh glory to god so now you know i'm a part of my savior i'm a part of his word it's a revelation that's my predestination if my god never foreknown me before the foundation of the world he's not god but he knows the end as though it's the beginning hallelujah i'm going to jump i might miss you i received the deed but when the holy ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it whether my father done it whether my grandparents don't my grandmother done it hallelujah i don't care who did it because i'm not go i'm not redeemed there i'm redeemed before my mother know my father i'm redeemed before adam fall i go back into the mind of god as an attribute of god not you the person but the germ of god in you hallelujah amen but when the abstract comes it struck off omitted everything i'm an abstract holder now hallelujah the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that god give me by grace bye for knowledge oh my hallelujah 252 he said the abstract title the debt is settled amen that debt is settled everything against it has been struck off amen hallelujah he becomes sin for me whom knew said that i might become the righteousness of god in him amen he took my place that i through grace might take his is that right you see we've got a fear we've got a fear we've got a fear we've got a fear that if we say what the word says people are going to think that i've got eternal life and there's nothing i've got to do listen but if you've got the holy ghost paul said i've got the power to leader to lead around a woman but the holy ghost in him never want to do it that holy ghost is where you recognize who you are and it changed your desires is that right so so i could do it but i ain't got no desire for that amen because christ in me is a hope of glory you see when the holy ghost comes truly there is truly a metamorphosis that take place because you you can look back at who you are and many times said when when i was 18 years old and sitting out there on the bench at my first job and the minister comes to me and sit behind me and he begins to witness to me and he begins to tell me you know about jesus christ and so and i was a good old baptist and i began to tell him on my fingers some problems i had you know why i i just can't surrender my life to jesus i can remember i reach about number 18. you know wise crack you know amen i reach number eighteen but you know but when i said yes to jesus and many times try to remember what did i tell him i don't remember but he took my sins and he put that he took my burden he took my cross he took everything that i and he put in the sea of his forgetfulness never to be remembered no more oh i said i'm redeemed redeem our love to proclaim it i'm redeemed by the blood of the lamb hallelujah not just the blood that watch but like clorox blood that when it strikes in it dispel it nothing of it can be found hallelujah and when he dispelled my sin he gave me an abstract by the opening of the word and hear us stand today i'm standing on the word of almighty god hallelujah can't you see why i'm happy have accepted the word of the lord the revealed word that was spoken by the prophet of malachi 4. hallelujah that's it so the bible becomes a new book because now when i read it i'm reading of him and i'm reading of myself hallelujah although when he preached christ the mystery of god revealed i was a part of that mystery listen the cherubims didn't believe you could make it the seraphim didn't believe you can make it the elders didn't believe you can make it that is why there was silence in heaven for half an hour when he comes to me hallelujah because the angels never sin they had nothing to repent but for me to go through what i go through and come out spotless like gold hallelujah it had to be the grace of almighty god that's why he says oh hallelujah it's not by me but he said the capstone will come crying grace grace unto it because i did not put grace into it none of us could make it but by the grace of god hallelujah everything that's against you oh i'm gonna close now with the easter seal hallelujah 1965 paragraph run on hate he said it's the holy spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message there is a message that messages jesus christ amen and that message is not right just to 1962 no it takes all of the word oh he said there were portraits on our land satan is there and because of that there's many counterfeit that has run the mark oh you go places that you talk about the third pull the seven thunders people get stuck up in a cocoon because they think you're going to say something that is way off the word but if there was a counterfeit there's got to be a genuine amen you're not going to take me off my predestinated position because somebody has go off the word no i believe in my position and you can't take me from that hallelujah so i believe in the third poll amen i believe in a life ministry i don't believe that brother branham's got to come back to establish anything because the bible says in revelation 10 7 the mystery of god will be finished it is finished it is settled it's for you to take the mystery of the word and apply to yourself it's in you it is there and the word is being restored back to the believer oh and it's coming hallelujah oh we used to sing that song every wrong go higher and i and that's where we're going oh i tell you one day we're going to come in the presence of almighty god amen the perfect word in a perfect people the bride of jesus christ let us rejoice and be glad and give honor unto him for the marriage of the lamb has come and the wife has made herself ready we are married to jesus christ the world hallelujah we're not waiting on a priest to come and holy holy holy oh bless you bless you no no no we have jesus christ himself hallelujah yes sir hallelujah amen for the truthful mystery of god that god revealed himself completely in jesus christ hallelujah amen that christ might have preeminence among the body of believers amen that he might restore us to eden as if there was no fall hallelujah now look at your position of eliezer and isaac eliezer was sent by abraham to find a bride for isaac you you know hallelujah sarah died and abram had remarried but here was isaac he's grieving over his mama so abram see the need that you need a wife to move on from there so you let eliezer make the promise promise me you won't take a wife from among these why dwell but go to my homeland i might need to do that for my girls amen i wonder sometimes if they're looking amen but go back to my home and don't tell them that i said that you know go back to my homeland and here it is eliezer took that responsibility and he said lord let it be that when i go there when i do this let her do that then i will know it's a vindication of what god wants hallelujah and when he met rebecca hallelujah oh and he said ah give me a drink of water she also watered the camel but but he had to go to the parents and i said uh let her let her steal she said i will go there was something that was calling her you you could have stayed over in the church a little longer but i will go i'm going to a land i don't know i'm going to a people i don't know i'm going into a message hallelujah that i don't understand but something tell me that my birthrate is there in the world and i'm taking all of it i let nobody tell you because they were there before you that they've got anything more than what you've got because god ain't got no grandchildren amen we are sons and daughters of god amen and god will give you your portion hallelujah amen you know my last trip to uganda oh there's wonderful brothers good preachers but but i know today they they love the manifestation of the holy spirit and you know in september 2019 when i was there i went with two brothers to preach what i did not know from kenya and i preached the first service and the brother very senior minister he was preaching the secretary he said in pentecost we had seen manifestation but but i never really see anything since i come to the message he said we pray for people and they go to the doctor and we don't know if it's the poor or the medicine that healed them i i tell you that that place of about a thousand and a half people amen their fate was dash you know so i felt responsibility and i go amen and i preached the manifestation of the holy spirit amen you know first of all the pastor he said brother i received the holy ghost you were so happy amen people were not only born again but sicknesses were being healed and the manifest that the power of almighty god came down because when you put the word to the test all god wants is somebody to believe and to take him at his word hallelujah the power of god moved through that place manifestation after manifestation oh hallelujah but you know so i went back at easter this easter and i said you know the people believe in the manifestation of the holy spirit but to the message of the hour there was more than that if the words not open we can say the words of the prophet we can quote the courts we can do anything we want but there's a revelation of the word of god to take you out of here amen it's useless you'll sit in a message church and miss the rapture because we must take the revelation of the word of god this message come to prepare a bride for a rapture and how did he prepare a bride for the rapture because he went and take the abstract title deed receive it to yourself and your record is searched all the way back to the mind of god then there is nothing to stop you hallelujah from going into that rapture and so i preached the opening of the word i tell you i preached seven services it was hard for one person because they pulled the life out of you amen praise god but the minister says that was certainly a help to them really to realize that this message is not just the first and the second pull no it is a turtle the opening of the word christ himself hallelujah condescend and uniting with the bride hallelujah and that's what the seventh seal was for he comes to me personally hallelujah the baptism of the holy ghost incarnated into the person of jesus christ the bride pregnanted with the seed word of god amen it's in you in you hallelujah and in christ the mystery of god revealed become personal amen because not only it shows you who christ is but it shows you who you are and you take your saint john 14 20 in that day that's personal when he comes to me when that word breaks loose in my life and that birth of that word and i know it is him so you can tell me anything you want to say about the cloud about the bear that has no effect on me because the womb of life is already sealed said no false doctrine can come in you know who you are amen brother branham is not the the prophet of the 5-4 ministry he's a dispensational prophet amen that has a word and a prophet is not only a seal piece of trumpet but it's a reveal of the word of god that is written in his life amen so he come to call a bride he is our eliezer rebecca never fall in love with eliasa no it was for isaac we need to be careful we don't go into idolatry we've got this tongue there that hang there that hang there that hang there it is a life of jesus christ in you amen not just words but come to us not in words only but in power and demonstration of the holy ghost then challenge yourself to the word of god he's your healer is your deliverer amen he's a problem solver he's a brother and bearer he is your completion the amen of the amen hallelujah so let us cross the veil into the abstract then you know the make known age i know that it's not what i did yesterday sometimes you go around with complexes of what the devil did in your life and you you're in a tail spin but god took you beyond that hallelujah back into the mind of god that is what the seals is for that is what the open book is hallelujah and i know that nothing on this earth can stop me jesus said i come from god and i'm going back to god when time blends in with eternity it is your theophany united with this glorified body and you'll be caught up in the here like the lord jesus god bless you god bless you for i say to you if the power of the world is restored to you in your mouth dominion like before the fall what would you do with that word in your mouth what would you do with it what would you do to your desires no wonder the prophet tell us and all that you love and all that love you you will speak them back to the word of god amen why worry why worry it's all there in the world hallelujah the bride is united with christ by the revealed word so brother branham speaks about the personal things in his life you speak about the personal things in your life because nothing can stop you now satan you can't stop us hallelujah we've got an abstract hallelujah that's what the word of god did for us so let us not be message church just you know going around in circles but let us take the revealed word of god because it's yours god bless you may you stand this morning amen musicians who can come as we pray amen amen lord take the records of my life and lord maybe search all the way back to you it's jesus oh it's jesus it's jesus in my soul for i've touched the hem of his garment hallelujah as we pray oh father and o god we thank you lord god for your word we thank you lord god that in simply city you show us who we are the lord god we are united with you the lord there's no condemnation to us oh god because we are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and that lord god you'll send us a word oh god when our names were locked in that book of redemption you've opened that book so that lord god all the ordinances that were against us lord god you took them and you nailed them to your cross and we can accept the clorox blood of jesus christ lord god help us to walk in this newness of life lord
