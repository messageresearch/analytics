[0:00] the Lord
[0:01] you love the Lord this morning
[0:09] this power he has Heavenly Father we
[0:11] thank you for your grace and goodness to
[0:13] us we ask Lord that you'll just bless
[0:15] our study this morning and bless brother
[0:17] wait as he's preparing Lord God and
[0:18] prepare our hearts this morning Lord to
[0:20] receive what you have in store for us
[0:21] today Grant it Lord that you'll help us
[0:23] in your name amen
[0:26] that we're getting into Hebrews
[0:28] chapter 9 here
[0:30] and uh
[0:32] I've been just kind of going back and
[0:34] reading the Hebrews again and there's uh
[0:37] you know you think as you're getting
[0:39] close to Hebrews 11 and 12 that we're
[0:41] kind of closing out Hebrews and and uh a
[0:44] lot of the a lot of the meaty things are
[0:46] kind of coming to an end but now we're
[0:48] just getting started there's some good
[0:50] things ahead for us
[0:53] um so Hebrews chapter 8 was talking
[0:55] about that uh in verse 13 Paul was
[0:58] talking about the New Covenant
[1:00] and that he saith a New Covenant he hath
[1:02] made the first old now that was decaith
[1:05] and waxeth old is ready to vanish away
[1:07] so we were last time we were kind of
[1:09] comparing the Old Testament the old
[1:11] Covenant and the New Covenant the old
[1:12] Covenant
[1:14] a covenant of of of of rules laying
[1:17] there on tablets
[1:18] and the New Covenant take those tablets
[1:20] and put them into the heart of the
[1:22] believer so Galatians chapter 5 is
[1:24] Paul's talking about he said for
[1:25] Brethren when you have been called into
[1:27] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[1:29] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[1:31] one another for all the law was
[1:32] fulfilled in one word even in this Thou
[1:35] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and
[1:38] James said if you fulfill the Royal law
[1:40] according to the scripture Thou shalt
[1:41] love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well
[1:43] so we're talking about agape love the
[1:46] life of Christ could be in The Believer
[1:49] and and just to kind of compare again
[1:51] the old new covenants then become a
[1:53] story a love story where you've got
[1:55] Christ being married to his bride the
[1:58] bride the bride and the bridegroom
[1:59] they're standing and that so there's the
[2:02] whole picture of the Bible laying there
[2:03] for us so as we as we begin to move over
[2:06] into Hebrews chapter 9
[2:08] Paul is comparing the old Covenant and
[2:10] the New Covenant then verily the first
[2:12] Covenant had also ordinances of divine
[2:14] service in the worldly Sanctuary for
[2:16] there was a tabernacle made the first
[2:18] we're in was the Candlestick and the
[2:20] table and the shoe bread which is called
[2:21] the sanctuary and again what he's doing
[2:24] is he's comparing these things that were
[2:26] types back then of their reality that we
[2:29] have now of Christ tabernacling himself
[2:31] in the life of the believer
[2:33] and we know that these things were were
[2:35] examples for us to look and see how that
[2:38] God how that God would move through a
[2:39] Believer through these stages of
[2:41] justification and sanctification into
[2:43] the baptism holy ghosts and all these
[2:44] things that it would represent until God
[2:47] Tabernacles himself and moves behind the
[2:49] veil of your flesh where Paul said and
[2:51] chapter 9 verse 3 and after the second
[2:53] Veil The Tabernacle which is called the
[2:55] holiest of all which had the golden
[2:57] sensor and the Ark of the Covenant
[2:59] overlaid roundabout with gold
[3:01] wherein was the golden pot that had
[3:03] Manna and Aaron's raw that budded and
[3:05] the tables of the Covenant and over at
[3:07] the chairmans of Glory shadowing The
[3:09] Mercy Seat of which we cannot cannot now
[3:12] speak particularly
[3:15] when Paul said that these things signify
[3:17] the Holy Ghost in verse 8 of chapter
[3:19] nine he said the Holy Ghost is
[3:21] signifying that the way into the holiest
[3:23] of all was not yet made manifest while
[3:25] as the first Tabernacle was yet standing
[3:27] which was a figure for the time then
[3:30] present and which were offered both
[3:31] gifts and sacrifices that could not make
[3:33] him that did the service perfect as
[3:35] pertaining to the conscience
[3:38] pertaining to the conscience and and I'm
[3:40] kind of moving fast through some of
[3:41] these just to kind of background what we
[3:43] covered last last week to kind of get
[3:46] get on into into Hebrews 9 but a
[3:49] conscience your conscience is that that
[3:51] that inner feeling that that voice that
[3:53] that tells you whether you're right or
[3:55] wrong the conscience that tells you
[3:56] where you're if you were to die now
[3:58] you're you're you're probably not going
[4:00] to go to heaven or the conscious that
[4:02] tells you I'm free you know when you get
[4:04] up from your prayer room and you've been
[4:05] watched clean and and and and you know
[4:08] because God has testified to you that
[4:10] that that you've been born again and a
[4:13] god brother Brown said your conscience
[4:15] tells you something inside of you tells
[4:18] you you're wrong see you know if you die
[4:20] you couldn't meet a holy God so if you
[4:22] now now what Paul is trying to lay it
[4:26] before us now through the holy ghost
[4:28] that through this New Covenant Christ
[4:31] has given us away for our conscience to
[4:33] be made perfect where your conscience is
[4:35] made clean you can look you can you can
[4:38] come boldly to the throne of God of
[4:40] Grace knowing that Christ died
[4:43] and paid the price for all of your sins
[4:45] and all of your past life all the things
[4:47] that you did are now covered by the by
[4:50] the blood
[4:51] but Christ being coming a high priest of
[4:54] good things to come by greater and more
[4:56] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[4:57] that is to say not of this building
[4:59] neither by the blood of goats and cows
[5:02] but by his own blood he entered in once
[5:05] into the holy Place having obtained
[5:08] Eternal Redemption for all for us
[5:11] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[5:13] us by his blood he paid the price
[5:16] because it's it's life his life paid the
[5:19] price and his life comes back into the
[5:21] believer
[5:23] so Paul says for with the blood of bulls
[5:25] and of goats and the ashes of an heifer
[5:27] sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the
[5:29] purifying of the flesh how much more
[5:30] shall the blood of Christ to through the
[5:32] eternal spirit offered himself without
[5:34] spot to God Purge your conscience from
[5:37] dead Works to serve the Living God
[5:40] and dead works is you know last time we
[5:42] looked at you know how the how the Jews
[5:44] will they will take the uh
[5:45] the the a Sepulcher and they'll they'll
[5:49] paint it white on the outside and many
[5:51] times you know you have like the
[5:53] Pharisees just acting things out on the
[5:54] outside it would look like they were
[5:56] they were doing what what the law
[5:57] required but on the inside they were
[5:59] still dead men's bones so what does the
[6:01] Holy Ghost do the Holy Ghost has power
[6:03] to change you on the inside
[6:05] to change your to change your thinking
[6:07] to change your motives and and that's
[6:09] that's really kind of a point that I've
[6:11] been belaboring is that the Holy Ghost
[6:13] is going to change you you know
[6:15] sometimes we kind of Labor in our minds
[6:16] that well as long as I have knowledge of
[6:20] the word and that's fine but the the Old
[6:22] Testament Jews they had they had
[6:24] knowledge I had knowledge of the word
[6:25] but the Holy Ghost is going to change
[6:27] your life it's going to change you so
[6:29] that you ain't the way that you used to
[6:31] be that that person that used to look at
[6:33] pornography and Luke used to smoke weed
[6:36] and all of those things and and think
[6:38] wrong and that your whole life is going
[6:40] to be dead because you now you're dead
[6:42] in Christ and you're you're changed your
[6:44] change person amen so so it goes back to
[6:48] I I really appreciated that sermon
[6:49] brother Louise preach Wednesday night
[6:51] because
[6:52] what is it it's love and if you get if
[6:55] you inspect your life and see do you do
[6:57] you love God because your life is going
[6:59] to be changed and if you don't love God
[7:01] if you don't enjoy coming to the service
[7:03] of the Lord
[7:04] if you don't enjoy coming to church and
[7:06] praying and reading your Bible then uh
[7:09] maybe it's time to examine our
[7:11] conscience what our conscience is
[7:12] speaking back to us as you're conscience
[7:14] been purged
[7:17] so that's what did work what's dead
[7:18] Works dead works is just acting out what
[7:21] you try trying to trying to trying to do
[7:23] right trying to work yourself into the
[7:25] kingdom of God trying to go through the
[7:27] motions but you've been called to to
[7:30] serve the Living God a living a living
[7:32] Christ in your members not just
[7:34] something that's whitewashed on the
[7:36] outside but dead on the inside so in
[7:38] Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 when brother
[7:40] Adam was preaching on this he said pass
[7:42] from Death unto life what do you care
[7:44] what the world thinks what do you care
[7:46] what your neighbor thinks our conscience
[7:48] has died and we're regenerated and Born
[7:49] Again by the spirit of God to serve the
[7:52] true and the Living God there you are
[7:56] so Ephesians chapter 2 says for by grace
[7:58] are you saved through faith and not of
[8:00] yourselves it is the gift of God not of
[8:03] Works lest any man should boast there's
[8:05] your dead Works dead works is where
[8:07] you're just trying to do it yourself for
[8:09] we or his workmanship created in Christ
[8:11] Jesus unto good works there's going to
[8:13] be works but not your works his works so
[8:16] it's not your works that saves you but
[8:18] there's going to be works because these
[8:20] signs the signs and wonders are going to
[8:22] follow a Believer The Life of Christ
[8:24] where the Life of Christ is put in into
[8:27] the believer it's going to produce
[8:29] is going to produce his life
[8:32] so in in verse 15 Paul says and for this
[8:35] calls he is the mediator of the New
[8:36] Testament that by means of death
[8:39] for the Redemption of the transgressions
[8:41] that were under the first testament
[8:43] they which are called might receive the
[8:45] promise of Eternal inheritance
[8:48] for where our testimony is there must
[8:50] also a necessity be the death of the
[8:52] testator
[8:53] for a testament is a force after men are
[8:55] dead otherwise it is it otherwise it is
[8:59] of no strength at all while the testator
[9:01] liveth now you can see I got over there
[9:03] in the corners some red blood cells
[9:06] because blood All Through the Bible why
[9:10] life is really the theme of The Bible
[9:13] but we're talking about a lot we're
[9:14] planning talking about planting a seed
[9:16] that comes up with with life the life of
[9:18] Christ and it's the Life of Christ in
[9:21] that blood cell that was broke on the
[9:23] cross that that died for us and and to
[9:25] come back and the believer life and so
[9:28] what is what is your Eternal inheritance
[9:31] is life we were talking about when we
[9:34] were examining in Hebrews chapter 7
[9:36] where
[9:37] where uh where Paul used the example of
[9:39] Melchizedek and looked all the way back
[9:41] to Genesis 1 26 27 and there's your
[9:43] inheritance laying there that God will
[9:46] give you eternal life so you've got an
[9:48] inheritance that Paul's speaking of the
[9:50] promise of Eternal inheritance for where
[9:52] a testament is there must also be a
[9:54] necessity be the death of the testator
[9:57] now brother Branham said in adoption he
[9:59] said inheritance by predestination I
[10:02] inherited something what inheritance
[10:04] there had to be somebody leave me an
[10:07] inheritance why do you say Jesus left
[10:09] you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus
[10:12] never left me an inheritance Jesus never
[10:14] left you an inheritance he only came
[10:17] down and paid for your inheritance
[10:19] brought you to your inheritance but your
[10:22] name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[10:25] before the foundation of the world God
[10:28] give you your inheritance your
[10:29] inheritance was first and Jesus only
[10:32] come a lot here's the way they try to
[10:34] make it God said well there's a lot of
[10:36] people lost I don't want them to be
[10:38] saved so I'll send Jesus down and
[10:39] perhaps maybe he'll somebody feels sorry
[10:43] I know what I've done and get saved oh
[10:45] mercy I wouldn't run my office like that
[10:48] even as poor as I do run it sometimes
[10:50] then I wouldn't do it like that how
[10:53] about God so now as we're examining this
[10:55] scripture where Paul is talking about
[10:57] your inheritance let's just run through
[10:58] the Bible and see what the Bible says
[11:00] about inheritance
[11:01] and I did it again I made it font small
[11:04] so bear with me
[11:07] I'm gonna beat up on myself
[11:09] Proverbs 13 says a good man leaveth an
[11:13] inheritance to his children's children
[11:15] and the wealth of the sinner is laid up
[11:17] for the just now you think about on the
[11:19] day of Pentecost when Peter come down
[11:21] and he said this promises to you and
[11:22] your children
[11:23] the problem with the promise is your
[11:26] inheritance that you've got an
[11:28] inheritance that God wants to give you
[11:29] his eternal life
[11:31] Ephesians chapter 1 says in whom also we
[11:34] have obtained an inheritance being
[11:36] predestinated according to the purpose
[11:38] of him who worketh all things after the
[11:40] counsel of his own will you've been
[11:42] predestinated to an inheritance
[11:44] the Ephesians chapter verse 18 says the
[11:48] eyes of your understanding be
[11:49] enlightened that you may know what is
[11:51] the hope of his calling and what the
[11:53] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[11:55] in the Saints
[11:56] you've got an inheritance that you have
[11:58] access to because because Christ died
[12:00] for you
[12:02] Titus Chapter 3 Verse 8 says that being
[12:05] justified by his grace we we should be
[12:07] made heirs according to the hope of
[12:09] eternal life at Romans chapter 8 verse
[12:12] 17 it says that if children then heirs
[12:14] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[12:16] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[12:19] may be also glorified together you
[12:22] you're an heir to everything that Christ
[12:24] gets
[12:25] because why it was written back back
[12:28] there in the beginning God said let us
[12:30] make man in our image you've got access
[12:32] by what Christ did on the cross to your
[12:34] inheritance now now we'll just we'll
[12:36] just examine this kind of kind of some
[12:38] highlights real briefly but God the way
[12:41] that God gives you and your inheritance
[12:43] when you're born again he he gives it a
[12:45] little bit a little bit a a little bit
[12:47] at a time you start off just like just
[12:50] like uh
[12:51] laughs
[12:53] just like when you're buying a house you
[12:56] you uh you you're not going to make all
[12:59] the payment at once but you you put a
[13:01] down payment first and the rest of the
[13:04] inheritance is given based upon your
[13:05] character growth first you get first so
[13:08] the down payment is the uh your new
[13:11] birth is the down payment of eternal
[13:12] life now let's see what program said in
[13:14] here he him he said in the Old Testament
[13:16] a father on The Great portion of ground
[13:17] and he had hired servants all around
[13:20] little places and houses or tents that
[13:22] watched over his flock now when a child
[13:24] was born into this home the father did
[13:26] not have time to take care of the son
[13:28] the way that he should so he'd go and
[13:30] hire a tutor or a razor someone to
[13:32] educate the child
[13:34] now here's where I think that the
[13:35] Pentecostal Church made their mistake
[13:37] when that son was born into the family
[13:39] he was a son at Birth but his
[13:42] inheritance was not yet determined it
[13:44] depended on his character so though
[13:46] being a son and if he was a disobedient
[13:48] son he would not inherit anything but
[13:50] still he was a son but if he was an
[13:53] obedient son he was heir to all things
[13:56] and we've been taught not only through
[13:58] Pentecostal Realms but through the
[13:59] Holiness group and the Badness and what
[14:01] more that when we're born again we're
[14:03] sons of God that's true but that yet
[14:06] that's just the beginning then then it's
[14:09] your character from then on what means
[14:11] the difference now how's this tie in
[14:13] with what we've been talking we've been
[14:15] talking about life that the Holy Ghost
[14:17] is going to change your life but it it
[14:19] it you've got to grow into it you grow
[14:22] into your inheritance and what what is
[14:23] your inheritance
[14:25] if we could just kind of sum up what
[14:27] your inheritance is eternal life a mind
[14:30] and body and subjection to the word your
[14:33] inheritance is the virtues of God on
[14:35] display your inheritance is speaking
[14:37] condition the ability to speak to change
[14:40] the atmosphere to change the situation
[14:43] Oneness and communion with God is your
[14:45] inheritance a supernatural understanding
[14:49] of Supernatural things the ability to
[14:52] discern truth from air and fortification
[14:55] behind God's word an anointed life and
[14:59] dominion over the Earth full Redemption
[15:01] full Redemption is your inheritance
[15:03] where God will not just redeem your your
[15:06] soul but also transform your spirit and
[15:09] clean out your flus until he can cap you
[15:11] off to to work out full Redemption and
[15:14] so that Christ is fully manifest in you
[15:17] until your your body is changed that's
[15:20] what your inheritance is
[15:24] so in returns you believe brother Ram
[15:25] said yes sir it's time to return return
[15:28] to what brother Brown and return back to
[15:30] the organization I come out of no return
[15:33] back to your inheritance The Inheritance
[15:36] that our father left us what kind of
[15:38] inheritance did he leave Wei ye in the
[15:41] city of Jerusalem until you're endued
[15:43] with power on high that's the
[15:45] inheritance so what's your inheritance
[15:48] is is the new birth The Life of Christ
[15:51] Living in you the power of God that God
[15:54] knew that was waiting for you before the
[15:56] foundation of the world because you were
[15:57] written in him not go join this one and
[16:00] go join that one go join this one wait
[16:02] till the power comes from on high how
[16:05] long until one day two days wait until
[16:08] don't take some little emotion some
[16:11] little frustration to wait there until
[16:13] you are dead and buried and born again I
[16:16] knew in Christ Jesus and every pulsation
[16:19] of your life beats out Jesus Christ so
[16:21] you can see the Life of Christ reflected
[16:24] right in your living the way you go yes
[16:28] sir to you can find that power like they
[16:30] had back there in the beginning now he's
[16:32] saying wait until you see that life
[16:34] manifested in you because the Life of
[16:37] Christ is going to change you we're not
[16:39] talking this morning about just just
[16:41] knowing a lot of things but but the word
[16:43] being revealed and and transforming your
[16:46] life and transforming your being so that
[16:49] you are different so that you are not
[16:51] the same the new birth is going to make
[16:54] you different
[16:56] in Hebrews chapter 9 verse 18 He said
[16:59] whereupon neither the first testament
[17:01] was dedicated without blood
[17:03] but when Moses had spoken every precept
[17:05] to all the people according to the law
[17:07] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[17:09] with water and Scarlet wool and hyssop
[17:11] and sprinkled both a book and all the
[17:14] people saying this is the blood of the
[17:17] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[17:19] you why does it take blood to bring a
[17:22] testament because it takes life and the
[17:24] life of that animal had to die for you
[17:26] in the old the Old Testament but in the
[17:28] New Testament it was a life of God that
[17:30] gave his life so that the life of God
[17:33] could come back into believer
[17:34] in Exodus chapter 24 it says Moses took
[17:37] the blood and sprinkled it on the people
[17:39] and said
[17:41] behold the blood of the Covenant which
[17:43] the Lord hath made with you concerning
[17:45] all these words so it was Christ's blood
[17:48] that he gave on the cross where in
[17:50] Hebrews chapter 9 verse 21 it says
[17:52] moreover he sprinkled with blood both
[17:54] the Tabernacle and all the vessels of
[17:56] the ministry and almost all things are
[17:59] purged or by the law purged with blood
[18:01] and without shedding of blood
[18:04] there's no remission and brother Adam
[18:06] said or or the the definition of
[18:08] remission remission before I get to what
[18:10] brother Brown said that the remission is
[18:12] release
[18:13] from bondage or imprisonment the blood
[18:16] of Christ releases you from your prison
[18:18] house the blood of Christ remission is
[18:21] forgiveness or pardon of sins letting
[18:23] them go as if they had never been
[18:25] committed remission of the penalty
[18:28] and brother Ram said and the message the
[18:30] inside he said the penalty of death as
[18:33] something has to die to pay that penalty
[18:35] so it can only be substitutionary or
[18:38] we're all in death if there wasn't a
[18:40] substitute for us to hold on to you see
[18:43] what the Life of Christ did on the when
[18:45] he died on the cross he'd give us
[18:47] something to hold on to when he give a
[18:49] when he gave the new birth on the day of
[18:50] Pentecost is something for you to hold
[18:52] on to because it says life and man in
[18:55] doing this realize that he needs
[18:56] something to hold on to something that
[18:59] he can put his hands on
[19:01] something he can say this is it I've got
[19:05] it I know it's in
[19:08] it so and and the message identified
[19:10] with the Christ he said in the Old
[19:12] Testament and and I know again this is
[19:15] small so I'll just read it and just
[19:17] listen and the Old Testament when a man
[19:19] wants to be identified as the house of
[19:21] God he took the most innocent thing he
[19:23] could find a lamb and he know the lamb
[19:26] was free from sin because it know no sin
[19:28] and he went and took the lamb and put
[19:31] his hand upon his head and confessed his
[19:33] sin and by faith he transferred his sins
[19:35] on the lamb and the innocence of the
[19:37] Lamb back on him and then the lamb died
[19:40] because it was a sinner and the man
[19:42] lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what
[19:44] God Said but what did he do he went
[19:46] right back out of the temple with the
[19:48] same desire he had when he come in
[19:51] because when that blood cell is broken
[19:53] which the Life Starts in one blood cell
[19:55] and when that blood cell was broken the
[19:58] life of the Lamb would not coincide or
[20:00] come back into the human life because it
[20:03] was an animal life the man went out with
[20:06] the same desire he had
[20:08] so therefore he committed sins
[20:10] continually all the time again let's
[20:13] take a moment to just compare the Old
[20:14] Testament where your desire would not be
[20:18] changed and the person would not be
[20:20] changed with the New Testament where
[20:22] you're going to be changed your life is
[20:25] going to be changed your desires are
[20:26] going to be changed your conscience is
[20:28] going to be purged
[20:29] but there come a time when God made us
[20:33] an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus
[20:35] and when a sinner puts his hands upon
[20:38] his precious head and confesses his sins
[20:40] and his sins is transformed or
[20:42] transferred from The Sinner to Jesus and
[20:44] the innocence of Jesus is transferred by
[20:46] the Holy Ghost back into that person
[20:49] he's a new creature in Christ Jesus
[20:53] that's where I want to be identified the
[20:56] Bible said he knowing no sin was made
[20:58] sin for us the reason he suffered was
[21:01] for our sins and is no more than what is
[21:03] right no more than our duties
[21:06] to look at these things and see that
[21:08] these desires that we have that God put
[21:10] in us to create in us to make us want to
[21:14] be like him your desire is going to be
[21:17] changed when God gives you his life
[21:20] so as we keep reading all in Hebrews
[21:22] chapter 9 Paul says it was therefore
[21:24] necessary that the patterns of things in
[21:26] the heavens should be purified with ease
[21:28] but the Heavenly things themselves with
[21:30] better sacrifices than these for Christ
[21:32] has not entered into the holy places
[21:34] made with hands which are the figures of
[21:37] the truth but into heaven itself now to
[21:39] appear in the presence of God for us nor
[21:42] yet that he should offer himself often
[21:44] as the high priest entereth into the
[21:46] holy place every year with blood of
[21:48] others for then must he often have
[21:50] suffered since the foundation of the
[21:51] world but now once in the end of the
[21:54] world after he appeared
[21:55] to put away sin by the sacrifice of
[21:58] himself and as it is appointed unto men
[22:01] wants to die but after this the Judgment
[22:03] so Christ was once offered to Bear the
[22:06] sins of many and unto them that look for
[22:08] him shall he appear the second time
[22:10] without sin unto salvation
[22:13] what brother Adam would say about this
[22:14] statement that he should appear the
[22:16] second time those that look for him to
[22:19] those he's going to appear to those that
[22:21] look for him
[22:22] said and how can I overcome he said on
[22:25] that Easter morning when he rose out
[22:26] yonder and job's body no more than a
[22:29] spoonful of Ashes he was waiting he was
[22:31] that elected group he rose from the
[22:33] grave and entered into the city with
[22:34] Abraham Isaac Jacob job amen for they
[22:38] look for such a person and to those who
[22:40] look for Christ the second time what was
[22:43] he saying that can overcome the things
[22:45] of This World by his grace to come into
[22:48] him and shut your eyes to anything else
[22:51] but him and his word he will appear the
[22:53] second time in glory for the trumpet of
[22:56] God shall sound the dead in Christ shall
[22:58] rise those which are alive and remain
[23:00] shall be changed in a moment in a
[23:02] twinkling of an eye be called up
[23:03] together to meet him in the air
[23:06] now if you want to go back and study
[23:08] this out some more there's a whole
[23:09] sermon that brother Brown preached owns
[23:11] this scripture right here and it's
[23:12] called The Message look the priest in
[23:14] 1963.
[23:16] and brother Brown made this statement in
[23:18] that sermon he said as a group of
[23:19] Believers today assembled together we
[23:22] want to fix our thoughts
[23:23] our principles and things upon the
[23:25] coming of the Lord looking for Christ
[23:27] who shall appear the second time without
[23:30] sin unto salvation to those that believe
[23:32] and are looking for him to come
[23:35] the writer says here that we look for
[23:37] Christ the second time to see him as he
[23:39] is and now we know that the word is
[23:42] Christ in the beginning was the word and
[23:44] the Word was with God and the Word was
[23:46] God and Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[23:48] yesterday today and forever therefore
[23:51] it's the word that we look to then for
[23:54] it is the expression of what God is and
[23:57] when God came in Christ he was the
[23:59] expression of what God was and whatever
[24:01] he was he ever remains because he's
[24:04] Eternal and cannot change
[24:07] and brother Ram went on to say he said
[24:09] you got to see that God knows that you
[24:11] are a sinner and that you have confessed
[24:13] your sins and God put your iniquity upon
[24:16] Him upon himself and become a man he
[24:19] crossed his strain and come down from
[24:21] being God to be man that he might die in
[24:24] your stead to give his self for you and
[24:26] you confessed your sin and not a
[24:28] manufactured Clorox but a power of God
[24:31] that was made blood that he might take
[24:33] away your sinful blood
[24:35] my sexual desire and make you a free man
[24:39] and woman of God there you are what are
[24:42] you looking at you say oh I belong to
[24:45] the Assemblies of God I belong to the
[24:46] United Pentecostal I belong to the
[24:48] Methodist the Baptist you're still
[24:50] focusing away
[24:51] yourself away Focus yourself in on Jesus
[24:55] Christ hear the answer come back all thy
[24:58] sins which are many are all forgiven
[25:04] so Paul said in Hebrews chapter 10 we
[25:06] finally made it to Hebrews 10. for the
[25:08] law of having a shadow of good things to
[25:10] come and not the very image of the
[25:12] things can never with those sacrifices
[25:14] which they offered year by year
[25:15] continually make the comers there into
[25:17] perfect
[25:18] for them will they not have ceased to be
[25:20] offered because that the worshipers once
[25:22] purged should have had no more conscious
[25:24] of sins but in those sacrifices there is
[25:27] a remembrance again made of sins every
[25:29] year for it is not possible that the
[25:31] blood of bulls and of goats should take
[25:33] away sins wherefore when he cometh into
[25:36] the world he saith sacrifice and
[25:38] offering thou what is not but a body has
[25:40] thou prepared me
[25:42] and burn offerings and sacrifices for
[25:44] sin thou Hast had no pleasure then said
[25:48] I load I come and the volume of the book
[25:50] it is written of me to do thy will o God
[25:55] amen brother Brown was saying a message
[25:57] one as he said
[25:59] didn't have to borrow any timber Timbers
[26:02] anywhere to make a body he didn't have
[26:04] to borrow from anybody to make a body
[26:07] the world was framed by the word of God
[26:09] the things were made out of things that
[26:11] don't appear God just said let there be
[26:13] and there was he didn't have to go over
[26:15] and say Mr Moon would you loan me a
[26:17] little Timber Mr Starr would you let me
[26:19] have some calcium God don't do that he
[26:22] didn't have to say Mary you loan me an
[26:23] egg I want to make a body
[26:25] so I can dwell in it God the Creator
[26:28] spoke and she was a mother right then
[26:31] and he made a body so that he could
[26:33] dwell in it and then behold it greater
[26:35] than Solomon is here he said God is not
[26:37] an idol God is a spirit
[26:40] the musicians can go ahead and come
[26:42] forward and we prostrate ourselves
[26:44] before that and the spirit don't come
[26:46] into some Idol or some so-called
[26:48] Christians would have us to believe but
[26:50] the spirit comes into you and you are
[26:54] God's house living walking around
[26:56] manifesting the Living God for God
[26:58] dwells not in temples made with hands
[27:00] but a body has thou prepared me you are
[27:04] God's letter a written epistle God is in
[27:07] you manifesting himself through
[27:09] if you could prostrate yourself before
[27:11] God and say God I'm a sinner come and
[27:14] come into me and then the Holy Spirit
[27:16] comes in and then you are a living Idol
[27:18] of God living representative of God
[27:21] walking around with God speaking through
[27:24] your lips to others we'll stop there but
[27:28] that is what the Holy Ghost does to
[27:30] change your life and make you a
[27:32] tabernacle for the Living God that God
[27:34] can express himself
