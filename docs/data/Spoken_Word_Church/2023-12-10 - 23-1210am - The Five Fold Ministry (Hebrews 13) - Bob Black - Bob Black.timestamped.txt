[0:00] we we've been kind of studying I I just
[0:01] can't get away from remember them which
[0:03] have the rule over you and uh I was
[0:05] thinking what does this have to do with
[0:07] Christmas you know the this time of year
[0:09] and that I think the last couple of
[0:12] years I kind of tailored my little
[0:15] Sunday school lesson more toward the
[0:17] this the season and whatnot but um I I I
[0:21] didn't really feel led to do that today
[0:22] but um it still does have something to
[0:25] do with the holiday season because you
[0:27] read over in the uh Luke Chapter 2 and
[0:29] and the first people that heard about
[0:30] the birth of Jesus were shepherds and um
[0:33] if you go read that story The they heard
[0:36] a Heavenly message that was uh
[0:39] announcing that the word is here and the
[0:41] Shepherds went and found out that the
[0:43] word was there and they went into the
[0:45] city to Proclaim it and everybody that
[0:46] heard their message was astonished and
[0:48] amazed and a't it funny how or
[0:51] interesting how that God sets up that
[0:53] pattern sometimes that you can read in
[0:54] the Bible the first that's what brother
[0:56] Bram said why do they have to be
[0:57] Shepherds why do they have to be
[0:59] Shepherds Shepherds Shepherds know where
[1:02] you can find the word and so I've got
[1:04] just kind of little picture that uh of
[1:06] this the fivefold Ministries five five
[1:09] people in this picture but it's really
[1:11] not just five people it's five different
[1:14] kinds of people that God will use their
[1:16] um their their attributes and things
[1:18] that they're born with to present the
[1:20] word to be able to use them in in
[1:22] different ways so uh let's before we
[1:26] read this again let's just go to the
[1:27] Lord in prayer Lord we so thankful to be
[1:29] able to gather around your word once
[1:30] more Lord and so thankful Lord to be GA
[1:32] together with with like f other
[1:35] believers of this like Precious Faith
[1:36] Lord and we're so grateful for all the
[1:39] blessings that you've given unto us in
[1:40] this last year we pray Lord that you'll
[1:42] just bless us today Lord and bless
[1:44] brother Wade as he's prepared and
[1:45] studying Lord open up our hearts to
[1:46] receive what you have for us we ask in
[1:48] your
[1:49] name so Hebrews 13:7 says remember them
[1:52] which have the rule over you have spoken
[1:54] unto you the word of God whose Faith
[1:56] follow considering the end of their
[1:58] conversation and we've kind of been
[1:59] studying in that that this doesn't mean
[2:01] you know necessarily that you're that
[2:03] these men are like ruling over you like
[2:04] with a rod of iron or something like
[2:06] that but it's actually the word that
[2:08] they're preaching that actually
[2:10] um uh uh takes takes control of your
[2:13] life and just to just to background just
[2:15] to just briefly in Ephesian Church age
[2:17] brother R said now I want to say that I
[2:19] believe in leadership but it's not the
[2:21] leadership of men I believe in I believe
[2:23] in the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:25] coming through the word I believe also
[2:27] that God has set men in the church men
[2:29] who are gifted by the spirit and they
[2:31] will keep the church in order I believe
[2:34] that I believe also that the church is
[2:36] ruled over by men that God sends to take
[2:39] charge but that rule is by the word so
[2:43] that it is not men ruling but the spirit
[2:45] of God for the word and spirit are one
[2:49] now if you really think that about that
[2:50] that's kind of that's kind of difficult
[2:51] to articulate isn't it God sets a men
[2:54] men over the church but it's actually
[2:56] God doing it through the men but you
[2:58] look at the man and you you think you
[3:00] maybe you you think it's just a man up
[3:02] there but yet God is using that man to
[3:04] speak words to speak some encouragement
[3:06] to help you through life and brother R
[3:08] said in Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[3:10] today and forever he said and God has
[3:12] said in the church what first apostles
[3:14] then prophets then teachers then
[3:16] evangelists then pastors is that right
[3:18] for the perfecting of the church God has
[3:20] did it it's not the preacher that
[3:22] preaches not mean if he's really getting
[3:25] himself out of the way now is that isn't
[3:28] that why before the service a lot of
[3:30] times preachers will pray Lord help me
[3:31] to get out of the way because we want to
[3:33] get away from all of our conspiracy
[3:35] theories and our political ideas and all
[3:37] our little personal things our vendettas
[3:39] or whatever we might hold against
[3:41] somebody else lay that all the way to
[3:43] the side and just let God speak it's the
[3:45] word all the way the word is what's
[3:47] going to control it's not the preacher
[3:49] that preaches it's God preaching through
[3:51] him it's not the prophet that sees the
[3:53] vision it's God speaking through him I
[3:56] do nothing except the father shows me
[3:58] first what to do that's the reason he
[3:59] had to go through Samaria that's why all
[4:01] these other things taken place follow
[4:03] life his life and see if that isn't
[4:04] right and in blind Bemus he said and God
[4:07] said in the church first what
[4:09] missionaries or Apostles Apostles and
[4:12] missionary as I told you taught you is
[4:13] the same thing one sent Apostles
[4:16] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[4:19] God set in the church for the perfecting
[4:21] of the church that's Divine gifts that
[4:24] God foreordained and set into the church
[4:26] seat those are for the perfecting of the
[4:29] church
[4:30] Jesus speaks through his Pastor speaks
[4:33] through his teacher speaks to his Seer
[4:36] his Prophet speaks through his
[4:38] missionary to the countries and so forth
[4:41] that's his gifts that he's put in the
[4:44] church now now this time of the year is
[4:46] when we're giving gifts and whatnot
[4:48] aren't you glad that God give he he sent
[4:50] nine spiritual gifts into the church he
[4:51] sent five five of these predestinated
[4:54] gifts into the church to speak a word of
[4:56] encouragement and help and so that's
[4:58] what it says in Ephesians 411 he gave
[5:01] some he gave these gifts to you and I he
[5:04] gave some Apostles and some prophets
[5:07] some look at the the way it's worded
[5:10] there because at at different times at
[5:11] different seasons of your life you might
[5:13] need a different gift more when you're
[5:15] first becoming a Christian it might
[5:16] benefit you more to hear from an
[5:18] evangelist but then you start coming to
[5:20] a church and you need something grounded
[5:21] somebody that can help you and counsel
[5:23] you and that's where you need a pastor
[5:25] and you might need a you might have some
[5:26] questions about the word and that's when
[5:28] you need a teacher so different seasons
[5:30] of your life you'll need you'll benefit
[5:32] from these different kind of gifts and
[5:34] he gave some prophets and some EV why
[5:36] why would you need a prophet maybe over
[5:38] in Africa where everybody's it's a
[5:39] little bit more a different situation or
[5:41] whatever you need God will put a prophet
[5:43] right there to be able to tell you well
[5:45] you're fixing to kill somebody and this
[5:47] is what this is what going to and and
[5:49] and lay things out like that because God
[5:50] knows exactly what we have need of and
[5:52] he'll give us that amen there some
[5:54] evangelists and some pastors and
[5:56] teachers for the perfecting of the
[5:57] Saints for the work of the ministry Min
[5:59] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[6:02] so let's look at as as time's already
[6:04] flying let's look at the Apostle the
[6:07] term Apostle is derived from the Greek
[6:09] word AP apostolos which means one who is
[6:12] sent away or
[6:15] messenger and the term missionary is
[6:18] derived from the Latin word missionaries
[6:20] meaning pertaining to sending or echoing
[6:23] the concept of being sent on a mission
[6:26] now I got a picture here of of brother
[6:27] Paco who we met down in Nicaragua and
[6:30] and he actually I was watching one of
[6:32] the videos of brother a and he was
[6:33] calling him out to preach and down there
[6:36] when we were down there I got to uh just
[6:39] kind of talking to some of the brothers
[6:41] and they were kind of talking about how
[6:42] that there's different individuals that
[6:44] you can if if God just really God will
[6:46] kind of move them into a place where
[6:48] they just are more maybe more impactful
[6:51] than some of the others and brother Paco
[6:53] is one of these individuals and he he uh
[6:56] I've got a picture here he he will go
[6:58] into the the J he's constantly going
[7:00] into the jungle going I've got him on
[7:02] he's my Facebook friend and you can see
[7:04] him constantly posting videos of going
[7:06] way into the jungle going down a river
[7:08] deep deep into the like this where
[7:11] there's just mud he's got to wear uh
[7:13] boots to to even walk in Minister CU
[7:15] there's so much mud another picture I
[7:18] was looking at had his his wife was with
[7:20] him and she she had fallen down and
[7:22] slipped in the mud and you can see it's
[7:24] not a very nice situation it's it's
[7:26] rough but God calls these people and to
[7:29] to be to take the gospel to a to a place
[7:32] where nobody's ever heard it before
[7:34] maybe nobody's ever know anything about
[7:36] it you got to break it down and make it
[7:38] simple and then and then set things in
[7:41] order in a way where maybe you know
[7:43] maybe a pastor or a teacher might have
[7:45] never seen a situation like that before
[7:48] now there's an apostle let's see what
[7:50] brother B said about an apostle he said
[7:52] an apostle is a missionary both the same
[7:54] word someone that sent why you never
[7:56] desire to be called a missionary I don't
[7:58] know a missionary AR is an apostle and
[8:01] how they was sent all these God has put
[8:03] in the church then how does he touch
[8:05] this I I found this quote online that
[8:07] says never pity missionaries Envy them
[8:11] they are where the real action is where
[8:13] life and death sin and Grace Heaven and
[8:16] Hell converge and there's a brother down
[8:18] in Nicaragua preaching as as these these
[8:21] little young believers are coming to the
[8:23] to the Altar for salvation and you think
[8:25] about they they are where the where the
[8:27] real action is I was talking to a
[8:29] brother about what a statement that
[8:30] Lonnie Jenkins made years ago that when
[8:33] where you go into a place where the
[8:34] gospel's never been pre presented before
[8:36] you always watch out for God to come on
[8:38] the scene and do something truly
[8:39] miraculous if the gospel NE has never
[8:42] come into an air before and it starts
[8:44] being preached you watch and you see
[8:45] limbs being restored and eyes coming
[8:47] open and the service is just absolutely
[8:50] phenomenal cuz look that's where the
[8:52] real action is where the gospel is being
[8:55] preached in a place that's never gone
[8:56] before that's what a missionary is being
[8:58] is called called to do the the door
[9:00] inside the door brother R said now we
[9:02] have those things in the church what are
[9:03] they for is the Apostle the Apostle is
[9:06] the highest calling a missionary is the
[9:10] highest calling prophet and so forth
[9:12] down but they're not any different
[9:15] they're all God's servants sit together
[9:17] to temper and bring the body of Christ
[9:21] together and he said I want to say that
[9:23] the greatest call there is in Earth to
[9:25] my opinion is the mission field anyone
[9:28] who is a missionary is an apostle for
[9:31] the word Apostle means one cent so
[9:34] they're both the same word or used the
[9:36] same why why would that be the greatest
[9:38] call there is on Earth because that's
[9:40] fulfilling the Great Commission to go
[9:41] into the all the world and preach the
[9:43] gospel to go there everywhere and
[9:46] preaching and he said now I believe a
[9:48] missionary is a guy that goes and comes
[9:50] that's a missionary Paul was a
[9:52] missionary he didn't stay now look at
[9:55] let me back up for a second I I don't
[9:56] mean to skim over this too fast he said
[9:58] if you go over there to stay they call
[10:01] that a missionary but that's a
[10:03] homesteader you just changed your
[10:05] residence see that's not a missionary
[10:07] Paul was a missionary he didn't stay he
[10:10] just kept going and going and going a
[10:14] missionary not just change his residence
[10:17] just keep going a missionary why cuz
[10:19] there's just something burning in you to
[10:21] take that gospel to somebody that had
[10:22] heard it before the Apostle is a special
[10:26] man he's a set her in order he's a man
[10:30] that's sent from God to set the things
[10:32] in order what's that mean you come into
[10:34] a place where where you got some kind of
[10:36] strange marriage and divorce situations
[10:38] You' never heard of before and he's just
[10:39] LED of God to to know how to position
[10:42] everything let's get this straightened
[10:43] out this way and and he's he's he's
[10:45] called of God to get to get things right
[10:48] to to approach situations that maybe are
[10:50] some odd and maybe maybe difficult but
[10:53] God has called a man for that purpose
[10:55] and he gave some Apostles and some
[10:58] prophets
[11:00] and brother BR would say there's five
[11:01] ministerial offices how many believes
[11:04] that there's first apostles prophets
[11:07] teachers pastors evangelists how can you
[11:09] say there's a pastor or evangelist
[11:12] without saying there's a prophet now
[11:14] that's that's just something maybe to
[11:16] keep your in pocket in your back pocket
[11:18] for that time when you need to pull it
[11:19] out how can you say that there's there's
[11:22] all these other preachers and there's
[11:24] not a prophet and I believe there still
[11:26] prophets today that's that's one of
[11:28] those the people that leave the message
[11:30] they throw they pull that argument out
[11:31] and say well show me that there was ever
[11:33] New Testament prophets there was plenty
[11:35] of new agabus and all the others and
[11:37] there're still New Testament prophets
[11:38] today even even
[11:41] now and this is one of them and I'm not
[11:45] promoting other ministers or whatever
[11:46] but I think many of us have heard about
[11:47] brother Abraham that he he's uh I was
[11:50] talking to brother from from Africa I I
[11:52] was talking to some other pastors that
[11:55] that were talking about how that you
[11:57] there's so many when he comes over to
[11:58] the states that want to get want him to
[12:00] come to their Church to discern things
[12:03] and to talk about things that are going
[12:04] on in people's lives that you know it's
[12:07] kind of hard to get to get uh him to
[12:09] come around but let's let's let's read
[12:11] what brother Brown said about uh in
[12:13] questions and answers he said I don't
[12:15] claim to be his Prophet many times I've
[12:17] said it when I think I when I didn't
[12:19] think I said it catch myself on the tape
[12:20] but I say that sometimes because if you
[12:22] want to give it in terms a prophet is in
[12:25] the English term is merely a preacher
[12:27] anybody knows that get the dictionary
[12:29] see a prophet is a preacher under the
[12:31] English dictionary but under the Hebrew
[12:33] or the Greek a prophet is a Seer one who
[12:36] forsees things and foretells things so
[12:39] let's think about that statement a pro a
[12:41] new testament Prophet means all of these
[12:44] fivefold gifts because they're preaching
[12:46] the word and they've got a revelation
[12:47] that they're sharing with you but
[12:49] there's one of those that's a Seer so
[12:51] that doesn't mean let's let's maybe just
[12:53] set something straight for a moment that
[12:55] doesn't mean if you have a particular
[12:57] amount of Revelation that you're automat
[12:59] Al a prophet no a prophet is a seer in
[13:02] other words that doesn't mean because
[13:03] you're a really good teacher or
[13:04] something that you're a prophet that you
[13:06] to fit into this category you got to be
[13:08] a Seer a Seer is one who foresees things
[13:11] and foretells things and brother BR
[13:14] would say a prophet is a Seer and is
[13:15] referred to in the Bible as the eagle
[13:18] who goes way high in the air and the
[13:20] higher you go the farther you can see he
[13:23] said a sear is a is a he is a Seer that
[13:26] in the spirit climbs beyond the emotion
[13:28] of the church he goes beyond the rhythm
[13:31] of the music he goes beyond the Clapping
[13:33] of the hands he goes beyond the joy
[13:34] among the saints he goes beyond all that
[13:37] God brings him up into a realm alone
[13:41] then he opens his eyes and he lets him
[13:43] look around and see things that is to
[13:45] come you to think about that that God
[13:48] can catch a man and move him up into the
[13:50] Eternal Realms of God and be able to
[13:51] look around and then like like brother R
[13:53] said peering over a fence and then he
[13:55] come back and tell us what he saw over
[13:57] the fence
[13:59] then he brings him back down among the
[14:01] members of the body to for for tell them
[14:03] of what is in the making a prophet is
[14:05] also a gift of knowledge a gift of
[14:08] knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which
[14:10] Co goes up and finds out these things
[14:12] that are to come and brings them back
[14:14] down but they must compare with the
[14:16] Bible with the
[14:18] book he said now but this Seer his
[14:21] subconscious is not back there neither
[14:23] is it here it's right here both of them
[14:26] are right together and now just kind of
[14:28] skipping down to save a few moments of
[14:30] time and this man that sees Visions
[14:32] can't help it he's just made up like
[14:34] that God made this man not to dream
[14:37] dreams this one to dream dreams and made
[14:39] this one to see Visions now think about
[14:42] every one of these men are made up in
[14:44] the way that they are to bring the
[14:46] message in the way that God wants them
[14:48] to bring it each one of them has a
[14:50] special
[14:51] makeup he said in the signs of his
[14:53] coming he said now watch he was the word
[14:55] see now Jesus he just said this because
[14:57] he was the word but to us we have have
[14:58] to approach God through the word see the
[15:01] word comes to the prophets they're not
[15:03] the word in the Old Testament now Elijah
[15:06] and Moses and all those great prophets
[15:08] they wasn't the word they were a
[15:10] perverted body that the word of God came
[15:12] to the Bible said the word of God come
[15:15] to the prophets they wasn't the word but
[15:18] Jesus was the
[15:20] word that's why it says he gave some
[15:22] Apostles and some prophets and some
[15:27] evangelists now here's the the one that
[15:29] that that we like especially when we're
[15:31] when we're a new Christian he says the
[15:33] Evangelist is a special man he's a man
[15:35] that's burning like a fireball he runs
[15:38] into a city and preaches his message
[15:40] then gets out of there somewhere else
[15:42] see he's a special man he's he can just
[15:46] he he can just come in and what's he
[15:47] doing now he's let's let's look at let's
[15:50] kind of break this down the primary role
[15:52] of an evangelist is to proclaim the
[15:55] gospel the good news about Jesus Christ
[15:58] he's communicating that core message of
[16:00] what how to be saved and making a call
[16:03] to your heart for to to come to the Lord
[16:06] so evangelists are going to play a role
[16:08] in in Outreach and and and growth
[16:12] they're they're they're really critical
[16:13] for bringing in new Believers and it's
[16:15] to lead people to a conversion
[16:17] experience and to encourage existing
[16:21] Believers and they're associated with
[16:23] church growth and Revival so what
[16:25] brother bandam said he said when you
[16:27] come out of this at I I I I I just found
[16:29] this quote
[16:31] where uh you know he be he began his
[16:33] ministry now you think about that he's a
[16:35] prophet that can slip into the role of a
[16:37] teacher or or or a pastor or an
[16:39] evangelist and in the beginning stages
[16:42] of his ministry God told him that to do
[16:44] the work of an evangelist and this is
[16:48] that Vision where he he saw the Oneness
[16:50] on one side and the trinitarian on one
[16:52] side and he he grabbed from each side
[16:53] and pulled it together and then he saw
[16:56] his Tabernacle that he was going to be
[16:57] preaching out of the building building
[16:59] and God told him this this is not your
[17:01] Tabernacle and he said where and he said
[17:03] I've seen the Tabernacle as it is today
[17:05] I said where's my Tabernacle and he set
[17:07] me down under the bright blue sky and he
[17:09] said do the work of an evangelist make
[17:12] full proof of your ministry for the time
[17:15] will come when they will not endure
[17:16] sound Doctrine in other words preach as
[17:19] hard as you can and P pull and call
[17:21] people to what you're preaching because
[17:23] there's going to be a time that people
[17:24] won't want to hear the truth now isn't
[17:27] it interesting that that a pastor can
[17:29] slip into the move slip into that
[17:32] Evangelistic role or a pastor can teach
[17:35] that you can move back and forth but you
[17:37] really got a a a a a a a a spot a slot
[17:42] that you're default to the best way to
[17:45] say it I
[17:46] guess and he gave some Apostles and some
[17:49] prophets and some evangelists and some
[17:54] pastors brother R said but you see in
[17:57] the church there is the pastor
[17:59] and that Pastor is a special person he's
[18:02] built now now look all the others are
[18:05] built where they can just come and go
[18:07] the Apostle's going he's he's just
[18:09] always on the move the Evangelist can go
[18:11] into a church and I tell you when you go
[18:13] and preach at a different church it's
[18:15] nice to be able to swoop in preach a
[18:16] nice message uh you know if anything's a
[18:19] little bit odd maybe that the pastor
[18:21] didn't like you're you're on the road
[18:22] and the pastor can sweep it up and clean
[18:24] it up you're gone go out to eat you come
[18:26] back to church but a pastor can't do
[18:28] that a pastor is built to where he can
[18:31] put up with the fusses of the people
[18:34] he's a burden Bearer he's the ox of the
[18:37] team he's a man that can sit down when
[18:40] somebody's got something against
[18:42] somebody else and sit down with them two
[18:44] families and take neither side now you
[18:47] think about what a supernatural thing
[18:49] this would be to people fussing and
[18:51] can't get along and the pastor's built
[18:53] that way that he can sit between them
[18:55] and smooth out the fusses that's right
[18:58] and reason it out and bring it right
[19:00] back into sweetness without taking
[19:03] either side see he's a pastor he knows
[19:07] how to take care of
[19:08] things now if you break this down again
[19:11] Pastor comes from the Latin for Shepherd
[19:13] pastor's guide care for and protect the
[19:15] congregation similar to how a Shepherd
[19:18] tends to sheep now all of these you
[19:20] could say are Shepherds and that goes
[19:21] back to that story in Luke Chapter 2 why
[19:24] it had to be Shepherds first it had to
[19:26] be Shepherds to know where Christ was so
[19:29] they could go into the City and tell
[19:30] everybody this is where Jesus is this is
[19:32] how to get to him but this one is the
[19:34] special one that's really he's really
[19:36] The Shepherd of that local congregation
[19:37] to keep all the sheep from running off
[19:40] keep everybody United keep everybody
[19:42] moving in the same direction and see
[19:44] what pastors teach they can slip over
[19:46] into that teaching role and explain the
[19:48] scripture and pastors provide personal
[19:50] and C spiritual counseling if you got a
[19:52] problem in your life you can go to the
[19:54] pastor and get get some help and pastors
[19:56] they also visit the sick they elderly
[19:59] and and and help people out that just
[20:01] need some personal personal help and of
[20:03] course they're the administrative head
[20:05] of that local church and brother Bram
[20:07] said always honor your pastor why why
[20:11] give special honor to your pastor
[20:13] because of all that that I just read
[20:15] Because of they're dealing with the
[20:16] fusses dealing with all the complaining
[20:19] dealing with people that feel like the
[20:20] things should go in a different
[20:21] direction they're dealing with all that
[20:23] he he said he's worthy of every bit of
[20:25] Honor you could give him the Bible said
[20:27] that yes sir and don't muzzle the ox
[20:30] that Treads out the corn I saw this big
[20:33] dispute on Facebook where everybody was
[20:34] saying that ministers shouldn't be paid
[20:36] and that's what brother B was saying
[20:38] here he said if you're dealing with all
[20:39] that there's nothing wrong with getting
[20:42] a paycheck from the tith or something
[20:44] there's nothing wrong with receiving a
[20:46] blessing because they're pouring out a
[20:47] blessing they're pouring out their life
[20:49] to you why should a pastor have to worry
[20:51] about paying their hospital bill or
[20:53] paying their or being able to pay next
[20:55] month's Morgans and everything it's
[20:57] they're they're Worthy of every bit of
[20:59] Honor that you can give them am and I I
[21:02] am the resurrection and the life he said
[21:03] now th then you have to got you got to
[21:06] have confidence this is the house of
[21:08] judgment the house of God where God
[21:10] comes down and passes his judgment your
[21:13] pastor is supposed to be a righteous man
[21:16] the congregation supposed to be with him
[21:18] 100% you're supposed to be just 100%
[21:22] together and in there now you see what
[21:24] brother ad is explaining that that is a
[21:25] role of a pastor to keep everybody
[21:28] moving in the same direction and to keep
[21:29] them United and to keep the keep the
[21:31] spirit
[21:32] moving you're supposed to be just 100%
[21:35] together and in there if you're not then
[21:37] Satan's got a way to get in you got a
[21:39] loophole somewhere so have everything
[21:42] cleared out how's Satan going to get in
[21:44] if you're not United if you're not in
[21:47] unity in Revelation book of symbols he
[21:50] said if a boy was at the door and
[21:51] knocked at the door latch tell the user
[21:53] ushers I have a telegram here for Mrs
[21:55] Mrs so and so and Mr so and so he would
[21:57] be a messenger an Earthly Angel your
[22:00] pastor when he stands here on the
[22:02] platform ministering the word of God he
[22:04] is God's angel to the church Messenger
[22:07] to the church therefore Pastor should
[22:09] never leave that word but stay straight
[22:11] with the word because he's feeding the
[22:13] shepherd's place because the word pastor
[22:16] means Shepherd look it up and find out
[22:19] if that ain't right a pastor is a
[22:22] shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him
[22:24] overseer over a certain flock to feed
[22:26] him with what but with the word of God
[22:30] now that's what Paul is talking about
[22:32] remember them that have the rule over
[22:34] you not with a rod of iron but with the
[22:36] word of God where the word can claim
[22:38] your life that's why Jeremiah 3:15 says
[22:42] I will give you pastures and that word
[22:43] the translation of that word actually
[22:45] means Shepherds I will give you pastors
[22:47] according to my heart which shall feed
[22:49] you with what knowledge and
[22:52] understanding in 1 Peter 5:3 says feed
[22:55] the flock of God which is among you
[22:57] taking over sight thereof not by
[22:59] constraint but willingly not a filthy
[23:04] ler not for filthy ler but of a ready
[23:08] mind and Jesus said when when he was
[23:11] going to go on the cross he told him
[23:12] when he saw he he was as he was
[23:14] preaching going into the cities he said
[23:16] he saw the multitudes and he was moved
[23:18] with compassion on them because they
[23:20] fainted and were scattered abroad as
[23:22] sheep having no Shepherd now in the
[23:24] natural that's what happens when uh when
[23:26] you when a when the Sheep when the
[23:28] shepherd goes he goes to sleep or
[23:29] something or goes he goes takes a little
[23:31] vacation then the Sheep start to be
[23:34] scattered that's natural in the natural
[23:37] and that's the same thing that will
[23:38] happen in the spiritual that's what
[23:40] Jesus was talking about here in Matthew
[23:41] chapter 9 he said then saith he unto his
[23:43] disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous
[23:46] but the laborers are few pray ye
[23:48] therefore the lord of the Harvest that
[23:51] he will send forth laborers into his
[23:55] Harvest and we'll stop right there God
[23:58] bless you thank
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:06] you
