[18:33] good morning morning let's turn to uh
[18:38] Second Corinthians the 4th
[18:56] chapter man everyone
[19:00] okay therefore seeing we have this
[19:02] ministry as we have received Mercy we
[19:05] faint
[19:06] not
[19:13] butc hand the word of
[19:16] God manifestation of the truth
[19:19] commending ourselves to Every Man's
[19:21] conscience in
[19:23] the but if our gospel be head it is head
[19:27] to them that are lost
[19:29] in whom the God of this world blinded
[19:33] the minds of them which believe not
[19:36] that's the light of the Glorious gospel
[19:38] of Christ who is the image of God shine
[19:42] unto them for we preach not ourselves
[19:46] but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves
[19:49] your servant for Jesus
[19:51] sake for God who commanded light to
[19:55] shine of Darkness has shined in our
[19:57] hearts to give the light of the
[20:00] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[20:03] face of Jesus Christ but we have this
[20:06] treasure in Earth and vessels that the
[20:09] Excellency of the power may be of God
[20:12] and not of us we are troubl on every
[20:16] side yet not distress we are perplexed
[20:20] but not in despair persecuted but not
[20:23] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[20:29] in the body of the dying of the Lord
[20:31] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[20:34] be made manifest in our
[20:36] body for we which live are always
[20:40] delivered unto death for Christ's sake
[20:44] that the life also of Jesus might be
[20:47] made manifest in our mortal
[20:49] flesh so then death work in Us in
[20:54] you we have the same Spirit of Faith
[20:58] according according as it is written I
[21:00] believe and therefore have I spoken we
[21:03] also believe and therefore
[21:06] speak knowing that he which raised up
[21:09] the Lord Jesus shall rais up us also by
[21:13] Jesus and shall present us with you for
[21:17] all things are for your sake that the
[21:20] abundance of Grace might through the
[21:24] Thanksgiving of many abound rebound
[21:29] to the glory of
[21:30] God for which cause we F
[21:34] not outward men perish yet the inward
[21:38] man is renewed day by

[21:44] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[21:48] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[21:51] Glory while we look not at the things
[21:54] which are seen But at the things which

[35:04] things will will be done okay amen so
[35:07] let's let's sing Open the Eyes of My
[35:11] Heart
[35:13] Lord Open the Eyes of My
[35:16] Heart I want to see
[35:21] you I want to

[36:01] holy high lift it
[36:05] up shining in the light of your
[36:10] glory pour out your power and love we
[36:14] sing Holy Holy
[36:21] Holy Holy Holy
[36:25] Holy Holy Hool holy
[36:29] holy holy holy holy I
[36:39] to amen that's true isn't it Lord bless
[36:42] each and every one of you uh it's good
[36:44] to be back
[36:46] here they wanted me to come I think last
[36:49] April and preach one of the fellowship
[36:50] meetings and I just couldn't come
[36:58] Hallelujah had a lot of things happen at
[37:00] the Bartlesville Tabernacle a lot of
[37:02] deaths in the
[37:03] church it's just a trying time we're in
[37:06] it's what it is am but you know he in
[37:10] all the Journey of the children of
[37:11] Israel he never left them
[37:14] alone so we understand that he will
[37:17] never ever ever forsake us that's right
[37:19] you know that word forsaken if you
[37:21] really look at it it means left behind
[37:24] and I've told the church they made
[37:25] billions of dollars off this book left
[37:27] behind mind and I said I don't care to
[37:28] read it it has nothing to do with me
[37:31] whatever because he said he would never
[37:34] leave
[37:36] me he'll never leave me behind so I
[37:38] don't my mind my heart I don't even
[37:40] think that way because I know I've been
[37:43] born again and once you have that Born
[37:45] Again experience you recognize who you
[37:47] are not just who he is but you recognize
[37:50] who you are and the part that you have
[37:51] in that so I really appreciate him and
[37:54] the Revelation that he's given this end
[37:56] time he has just give us part word he
[37:58] hasn't just given me
[38:00] justification you know he's given me the
[38:02] mystery of God should be finished right
[38:05] in the day of the voice of the seventh
[38:07] angel I tell our church and I remind
[38:09] them a lot I say if a preacher comes in
[38:11] the pulpit and preaches a mystery you
[38:13] run from him yeah because my Bible says
[38:16] in 10:7 the mystery of God should be
[38:19] finished and I will declare to you that
[38:21] the mystery of God is finished in this
[38:24] hour so if a man come and preach you a
[38:26] mystery or a doct that you can't find in
[38:28] the message of the hour run for your
[38:30] life get away from him you understand
[38:33] because I will tell you he is he is the
[38:35] Satan that has transformed himself into
[38:37] an angel of Light is what he is so what
[38:41] I want to minister on today I preached a
[38:43] whole series on it I actually here when
[38:46] I was here the last time I was in the
[38:47] middle of this series and I was
[38:49] preaching on the history more of the
[38:51] history on the seven feasts and then I
[38:53] went home and finished that and then uh
[38:58] later on I got looking at it and instead
[39:01] of putting and brother R said you could
[39:03] put those seven feasts in the church
[39:05] agent I've got a quote I maybe you know
[39:07] the quotes brother but he said that you
[39:09] could put those seven feasts in the
[39:11] church ages right then I got looking at
[39:14] it and I thought it's not enough just to
[39:15] put them in the church ages you got to
[39:17] put them in the
[39:18] individual is that right because see
[39:21] what God is doing in this end time he's
[39:23] building a living Tabernacle for a
[39:25] living God is that right right that word
[39:28] living is now existent so let's put it
[39:30] like a now existent
[39:33] Tabernacle right of a now existant God
[39:36] so that's what it is today he actually
[39:38] exists in a bride people is what he does
[39:41] and it's tabernacling deity it's it's
[39:44] Jesus Christ in Bride form is that right
[39:47] that's what our Prophet said and that's
[39:49] exactly what it is so just want to let
[39:51] you know but I'm going to talk about our
[39:53] feasts and I'm going to hit some of them
[39:55] and the feasts that I really want to
[39:56] conent on today is the Feast of
[40:00] Tabernacles amen that is if if you want
[40:03] to zero in on a particular Feast that is
[40:05] the most important Feast that there is
[40:07] for us it is the seventh Feast Amen
[40:10] brother said the seventh seventh Church
[40:12] age right if you're going to put in the
[40:13] history of the church age then the
[40:15] seventh Feast is the Feast of
[40:17] Tabernacles is that right there's a lot
[40:20] of things that go on a lot of attributes
[40:21] of that that comes but it not only comes
[40:24] to the church ages but there's a people
[40:26] in those Church ages
[40:27] even when brother Brandon preached the
[40:29] stature of a perfect man you know I told
[40:31] the church you look at brother brandham
[40:33] what what it shows there here oh I like
[40:35] that I didn't know it was here see
[40:37] brotherly kindness right how many
[40:38] believe brother brandom had brotherly
[40:40] kindness I do you want me to I'm going
[40:43] to I going to say a quote to explain to
[40:45] you brotherly kindness hello Miss dog
[40:47] meat yeah yeah can I tell you that right
[40:52] did you know that was brotherly kindness
[40:54] yeah a lot of people don't think it is
[40:57] right but he said it did he not he said
[40:59] hello Miss dog
[41:01] me that was brotherly kindness so
[41:04] sometimes what you think brotherly
[41:06] kindness is and what brotherly kindness
[41:08] really is it's not this you falling all
[41:10] over somebody and shaking their hand say
[41:12] I love you brother and all that if you
[41:15] really love a brother you'll correct him
[41:16] you understand and if you got the spirit
[41:18] of Christ you'll take that correction is
[41:20] what you'll do so in the Statue of a
[41:23] perfect man brother brandham had to
[41:24] start explaining some of these things
[41:26] here to us is that right that's right
[41:29] and this right here I use a lot when I
[41:31] preach the feast days in a minute I'm
[41:33] going to show you why okay sorry to
[41:35] leave you standing I'm I'm not like
[41:37] brother ju forny where your helicopters
[41:39] up me helicopters down I tell people our
[41:41] church I'm like a C130 Transport I'm big
[41:44] and I go and finally I hit the end of
[41:46] the rail the the runway I'm up in the
[41:49] air and I come down a little slow too so
[41:51] you bear with me here cuz I preach this
[41:53] in 15
[41:55] sermons and I'm going to put it into one
[41:58] you understand that's what I'm going to
[41:59] try to do I did it the other day and it
[42:01] took me an hour and 20 minutes I hope to
[42:02] shorten it up brother Wade told me if I
[42:04] take longer then it means I got less
[42:06] time downstairs to relax and I got to
[42:09] come back at two so if I keep you longer
[42:12] I'm not hurting you I'm hurting me okay
[42:15] so my goal is to get out of here as
[42:17] quick as I can to get downstairs okay so
[42:19] let's go to the scripture second Timothy
[42:22] 3:16 amen
[42:30] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[42:32] God it is profitable for Doctrine for
[42:35] reproof for correction for instruction
[42:38] in righteousness where you the man of
[42:40] God right where you can have stand
[42:42] righteous before God right that the man
[42:44] of God may be perfect complete right
[42:48] right thoroughly thly and thly means all
[42:52] the way I want to say thly is soul
[42:55] Spirit body you understand we don't have
[42:58] something that just deals with the soul
[43:00] we don't have something that just deals
[43:01] with the spirit we don't have something
[43:03] that just deals with the flesh this is
[43:04] throughly it's all the way through do
[43:06] you understand this absolutely deals
[43:09] with the total man where we're at the
[43:11] stature of a perfect man that's what we
[43:13] got to come to right we really do truly
[43:16] furnished unto all good works okay now I
[43:20] want to read let's go to Leviticus 23
[43:22] and 1
[43:28] you know what it says God in Hebrews 1
[43:30] God in sunry times spake and and where
[43:33] it says spake by the prophets brother
[43:35] random corrected that did you know that
[43:37] he said it wasn't spake by the prophets
[43:39] it spake in the prophets amen little
[43:42] different isn't it exactly so you can
[43:44] run your head all you want to me but
[43:46] until you live it you don't believe it
[43:48] can I just be honest with you that's the
[43:50] way it is and the Lord spake unto Moses
[43:53] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[43:56] and say unto them concerning the feasts
[43:58] of the Lord now these are not the Feast
[44:00] of Israel does everybody understand that
[44:03] a lot of people misunderstood they say
[44:04] well those were the feasts of Israel and
[44:06] they leave them back there no no these
[44:08] were the feasts of God these are the
[44:11] feasts of the Lord and if God want
[44:13] establish is something it's Eternal does
[44:15] everybody understand that God don't
[44:17] change his mind about his word right so
[44:19] I want to establish it's a feast of the
[44:21] Lord which ye shall Proclaim you know
[44:24] what Proclaim means preach amen which ye
[44:28] shall preach is that right right to be
[44:32] holy convocations convocations is a holy
[44:34] gathery right is that right even these
[44:38] are my feasts he stresses it to you
[44:41] right these are his feasts they're not
[44:44] your feasts you understand but you're a
[44:45] part of it because you know what in the
[44:47] end times she is him amen right that's
[44:51] right am if it's an open book you know
[44:53] who I found in there I didn't just find
[44:55] Jesus Christ in there found me so now if
[44:59] they're his Feast they're my Feast you
[45:01] understand because where your husband
[45:03] goes the wife goes too I hope ain't that
[45:05] the way it's supposed to work sure it is
[45:11] Glory let's see where are my six days
[45:14] shall work be done but the seventh day
[45:15] is the Sabbath of rest and holy
[45:18] convocation ye shall do no work therein
[45:21] not by works least any man should boast
[45:24] okay we know that it is the Sab of the
[45:27] Lord in all your dwellings every one of
[45:30] you do you understand that is this Len
[45:34] what he said a living Tabernacle of a
[45:37] living God in all your dwellings there's
[45:40] going to be a Sabbath on that seventh
[45:41] day does everybody understand you're
[45:43] going to enter into your rest is that
[45:45] right remember Naomi is that or Ruth
[45:49] when when he was doing the the kinsman
[45:51] redeemer she was resting is that right
[45:54] she entered into a rest is that right
[45:57] that's what we are what was in
[45:58] Revelation five open up the book of
[46:00] redemption is that right he's doing the
[46:02] kinsman redeemer work and you know what
[46:04] I'm just sitting in a chair resting it's
[46:06] not my Works least any man should boast
[46:09] there's nothing I can do it's all Grace
[46:11] it's what he done for me is that right
[46:13] so I thank God he's given me a
[46:15] revelation these are the feasts of the
[46:17] Lord even holy convocations which ye
[46:20] shall Proclaim preach right in their
[46:23] seasons can I say this you supposed to
[46:25] be instant Inc seon and out of season is
[46:28] that what Paul said let's bow our heads
[46:31] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[46:32] the reading of the word Lord we pray
[46:34] that you'll help me to get myself out of
[46:35] the way oh Father may you come and
[46:37] minister to this people Lord Lord I
[46:39] appreciate the little Lula church here
[46:41] Lord Lord their Spirit-filled word
[46:44] living people even the ministers Lord
[46:46] they don't rule the people with fear or
[46:48] nickan ISM but they rule over them by
[46:51] feeding them the word what a great what
[46:55] a great PA thing a p p is and a gift to
[46:57] a local assembly I pray that you'll
[46:59] bless this people oh Father and Quicken
[47:02] your word to us today Lord we ask these
[47:04] things in Jesus Christ's name amen you
[47:07] may be seated amen like I say the last
[47:09] time I was here and uh preached uh I was
[47:14] in the middle of this at church so I
[47:15] really didn't bring this here uh but
[47:18] when I went home I was in the Atlanta
[47:20] airport and I was standing there and
[47:22] believe it or not there was a Jewish
[47:24] fell there and you know he had the the
[47:27] big hat on you know the black he had his
[47:29] prayer Shaw on he was there actually
[47:30] praying when I got there stood in the
[47:32] corner with his prayer book doing like
[47:34] that yeah and so I thought you know I'm
[47:35] going to take advantage of this guy
[47:37] right that's right so I went up there
[47:39] and I said uh can I talk to you for a
[47:41] minute he said well sure yeah you know
[47:43] of course you know we're dogs to them
[47:44] you understand that don't you so they're
[47:47] they're a little leery of us so anyway I
[47:49] asked him a few questions and I want to
[47:51] read I'd actually wrote it down I've got
[47:53] more notes up here so if I fumble around
[47:55] would you bear with me
[47:57] I tell our church don't get nervous
[48:00] God's not nervous is he that's right so
[48:02] I wrote it down here while I was at the
[48:03] airport and I just I I actually went
[48:06] back home to the church and preached on
[48:08] this subject and it and it it brings a
[48:09] very deep subject when you hear it I
[48:11] asked him this I said do you celebrate
[48:13] the Feast do you mean the festivals he
[48:16] said yes so a feast is a celebration
[48:19] does everybody understand that the feast
[48:22] is a celebration and this is what I
[48:23] teach our church in Daniel's 70 weeks
[48:26] brother said the anointing that'll be in
[48:28] the Millennium is Joy does everybody
[48:31] understand that see restore the joy of
[48:33] my salvation is what David had asked for
[48:36] and yet as message Believers we sat
[48:38] around the most long-faced people on the
[48:40] face of the earth now you tell me how
[48:42] you can do that if you've come right and
[48:46] you are celebrating when you come to
[48:48] church you're supposed to be celebrating
[48:49] you're supposed to have a joy in your
[48:51] heart I told our church if the anointing
[48:53] in the Millennium is going to be Joy
[48:56] brother Brown Say what you are here is
[48:58] what you're going to be there so if you
[49:00] don't start showing some Joy here amen
[49:03] you're not going to be there you
[49:05] understand what I'm saying you're not
[49:06] going to mess that up you know you may
[49:08] mess something up down here but you're
[49:10] not going to mess that Millennium up so
[49:12] if you don't have any Joy here what
[49:14] makes you think you'll be there so I
[49:17] told our church you better get some joy
[49:18] in your hearts what you better do is
[49:20] that right and I'm going to tell you
[49:21] when God brings a revelation to you
[49:23] it'll bring joy it'll bring the
[49:25] stimulation of Revelation you'll have
[49:29] joy in your heart you can't wait till
[49:31] the church do open cuz you're so full of
[49:34] the Holy Ghost you can't wait to hear
[49:36] the word of the Living God is that right
[49:39] so there's what we need to come to as a
[49:42] church as a bride can I say that okay
[49:45] amen next question as you know three of
[49:48] the feasts it is required you go to
[49:50] Jerusalem did you know that you got to
[49:53] go for the Feast of unleavened bread you
[49:55] got to go for the feast to Pentecost
[49:57] right so a Pentecostal experience is not
[50:01] an option come on brother is that right
[50:04] you're supposed to have a Pentecostal
[50:06] experience is what you're supposed to
[50:08] have is that what brother saying we
[50:10] don't believe in a Pentecostal
[50:11] organization or denomination well but we
[50:14] do believe in a Pentecostal experience
[50:16] is that right right sure it's required
[50:19] you be there it's required you come to
[50:21] the Feast of unleavened bread what is
[50:24] leavening it's a type of of the the
[50:27] doctrine of the scribes and the
[50:29] Pharisees you got to come to unleavened
[50:31] bread which means you got all that
[50:32] cooked out of you did not brother B say
[50:35] you burn that you can't bring that over
[50:37] into this then you have to burn some of
[50:40] those Baptist ideologies that you picked
[50:43] up sure you did because this is
[50:45] unleavened where we're at folks there's
[50:48] no leaving in it whatsoever is that
[50:50] right okay so unleavened the the Feast
[50:54] of unleaving you had to be there feast
[50:56] of Pentecost you had to be there the
[50:58] third Feast that was a requirement y
[51:01] every male every male had to go there
[51:04] the Feast of
[51:05] Tabernacles so I'm going to tell you the
[51:07] Holy Ghost is not an option it is not an
[51:10] option in the day okay it is a
[51:13] requirement all the males have to go
[51:15] there does everybody understand so there
[51:17] was three of them you were required to
[51:19] be there do you know what Jesus's
[51:21] Ministry he walked up and down in those
[51:23] feast days exactly when he was there
[51:25] during those Feast he would actually
[51:28] preach that he was those feasts all the
[51:31] feasts were were a shadow of things to
[51:33] come just like the scripture says all
[51:36] scripture is given by inspiration those
[51:39] feast days spoke of Jesus Christ but you
[51:42] can't stop it there you can't put to
[51:45] Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago he is a now
[51:49] a living existing God tabernacled in a
[51:53] br so those seven feasts will be on this
[51:56] play in the end time in the bride amen
[52:00] Jesus Christ in Bride form come on
[52:02] brother is that right right it
[52:06] is I asked him that you know as you know
[52:09] three of the feasts is required you go
[52:11] to Jerusalem do you right no the rabbis
[52:15] changed that since the temple was
[52:16] destroyed oh
[52:18] my they got no Tabernacle you understand
[52:22] but I'm going to tell you I tell people
[52:23] in our church this Moses had a vision Y
[52:28] is that right of the Tabernacle right he
[52:30] got caught up he was on the mountain he
[52:33] seen the vision of the Tabernacle is
[52:35] that right right he come down and he
[52:37] told the people did Moses build it the
[52:41] people build it that's right and people
[52:42] in this message wonder about the tent
[52:46] Vision didn't Moses have a tent Vision
[52:49] who built it didn't Moses build it do
[52:52] you expect brother Brandon to come back
[52:53] and build that tent no he gave you the
[52:56] ision the prophecy of it you know the
[52:59] word testimony means prophecy a
[53:02] testimony is you take the prophecy of
[53:05] this hour and you live it if you don't
[53:08] put Flesh on it you don't believe it
[53:10] come
[53:12] on Amen so when it talks about in
[53:15] Hebrews 11 a testimony brother man said
[53:18] testimony is prophecy exactly what is it
[53:20] what you testify of the way you walk out
[53:23] there is your you are either fulfilling
[53:26] the Prophecy of the message of this hour
[53:29] or you're not one of the other and don't
[53:31] you say you got the holy ghost live a
[53:33] hound dog life you got the holy you got
[53:37] the god tabern KN in you you can't do
[53:40] those things you try to accuse God of
[53:43] that that's nonsense exactly amen
[53:47] bless if there's ever a time we need to
[53:50] clean up right is
[53:52] now now Glory am
[53:57] this thing's fixing to close out you
[53:59] understand that we need to get ready
[54:02] come on Amen thank you you do know the
[54:05] Messiah is coming to Israel he looked me
[54:08] right in the eyes and you know what he
[54:09] said Elijah amen see I forgot I received
[54:14] my
[54:15] Elijah I forgot they ain't looking for
[54:17] the Messiah come on they're looking for
[54:19] Elijah that's right I had a heart attack
[54:22] I almost had a screaming fist that's
[54:24] right that's the truth I said well sure
[54:26] he looked me right in the face and I
[54:28] said you know the Messiah he said I said
[54:30] are you looking for he said Elijah he
[54:32] didn't say any other word I stepped a
[54:35] couple of steps back I said well sure
[54:37] Glory I didn't disagree with that's what
[54:39] they got to get to Elijah right we
[54:42] understand that by the message of the
[54:43] hour that's right am that's right I
[54:45] asked him I said well what are you going
[54:47] to do he said I don't know come on and
[54:49] that kind of the way it was for us amen
[54:52] did we really know did we have a
[54:54] revelation tell Elijah got here no no
[54:58] that's right they don't either they're
[54:59] just as confused as they were out there
[55:01] 969 denominations you talk about
[55:05] confused right I worked one time with a
[55:08] Jewish man from Russia we were walking
[55:10] down a Runway at work cuz we went over
[55:12] to the cafeteria I looked at him I said
[55:14] Mike I got a question to ask you I just
[55:16] could you answer it I said do you
[55:20] believe that the Messiah is going to
[55:21] come out of Bethlehem he said well sure
[55:24] the scripture says that I said now now
[55:26] my next question is you just gave
[55:28] Bethlehem back to the PLO will he be
[55:30] Arab Oh my he looked at me and he said I
[55:34] never thought of that I said there ain't
[55:36] no Jews in the PLO they're Arabs right
[55:39] so what are they looking for they don't
[55:40] even understand the very scripture he's
[55:43] supposed to come out of Bethlehem they
[55:45] gave it to the PLO is that right so what
[55:48] are they thinking over there
[55:51] right right what are they going to make
[55:53] a league with right I told them the
[55:55] other day you know God started working
[55:57] on getting the Jews out of Europe back
[55:59] in Martin Luther's day Martin Luther
[56:01] said they were Antichrist did you know
[56:03] that right away God laid that right down
[56:06] there and I told him I said you know you
[56:08] had to take every dime from a Jew to get
[56:10] him moving right sure he'll hang on to a
[56:13] dollar bill you hand him a dollar bill
[56:14] he laying the floor with it he won't let
[56:16] it up ask a Jew how much money he's a GU
[56:18] he'll never tell you you talk about a
[56:20] man who loves a dollar bill they love a
[56:22] dollar bill right there right so what do
[56:24] you think that persecution why it was so
[56:27] hard why there were 6 million people
[56:29] because that's the only way they could
[56:31] get out of Europe right they controlled
[56:33] all the money of Europe go look at the
[56:35] history of it that was the tender hand
[56:37] of Jehovah to get them out of Europe
[56:40] because he's wanting to go back to the
[56:42] Jews and he can't do it as long as they
[56:44] got a hold of a dollar bill is't that
[56:46] right
[56:51] exactly I asked him I said what sector
[56:53] you in he said between hidic and
[56:55] Orthodox you know the Jews have more
[56:56] denominations than we do they have the
[56:59] liberal Jew the conservative Jew the
[57:00] hidic Jew the Orthodox Jew they're just
[57:03] as messed up right with denominations as
[57:05] we are is that right sure do you know
[57:09] where the ark is no I said do you know
[57:12] where the manora is he said yes I told
[57:14] him yeah the pope had it that Rascal and
[57:17] he said he conferred with me he shook
[57:19] his head cuz on the Arc of Triumph it
[57:21] shows the man manora where Titus took it
[57:24] into Rome is that right why you think
[57:26] they're in the middle of this thing that
[57:28] that last week at Daniel how do you
[57:29] think they're going to make a league
[57:30] with them they got to have that manora
[57:32] they want that manora does everybody
[57:34] understand that there's a lot of things
[57:35] that's in Rome they want and they're
[57:37] going to make a league to get it right
[57:40] exactly so I just wanted to show you
[57:42] this conversation I had but I I tried to
[57:44] sit around the feast I said what do you
[57:46] call God they said Hashim do you know a
[57:49] Jew in conversational language cannot
[57:51] say the word God right he can't say the
[57:54] word Jehovah y he can't say Elohim I
[57:58] asked him I said uh you don't call him
[58:00] Jehovah or Elohim he said only in prayer
[58:03] in general conversation we call him
[58:05] Hashim that is a name that they conjured
[58:08] up do you understand and then I got
[58:10] excited I said you know what I know the
[58:12] lovely name of God Jesus Christ that's
[58:15] right that's right you talk about Grace
[58:17] I understood Grace real good after that
[58:20] they don't even know the name of God yet
[58:22] is that right they're going to find it
[58:23] out in their atonement aren't they
[58:25] they're going to find find out that name
[58:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ the one that
[58:28] paid the price for Redemption what did
[58:31] Brother brand sit there waiting for when
[58:33] he preached the seven the the the Feast
[58:35] of the trumpets right he said they are
[58:38] waiting for their atonement right the
[58:40] part of their atonement is that lovely
[58:42] name do you understand what I'm saying
[58:44] they have not spoke that name and
[58:46] they'll think he's a a belly buub
[58:49] brother said they called Jesus Christ
[58:50] Bells above the lowest name you could
[58:52] give a human on earth oh my that's how
[58:55] lowly

[58:59] right I asked him about the Feast of
[59:01] trumpets he said it is our new year a
[59:04] lot of people don't understand there's a
[59:06] civil calendar there's a religious
[59:08] calendar and the Feast of trumpet starts

[1:02:17] barley is it has no leav whatsoever in
[1:02:21] it amen Jesus had no sin does everybody
[1:02:24] understand that cuz if he had sin if he
[1:02:26] had leaven in him how could he be My
[1:02:28] Sacrifice it took a perfect sacrifice is
[1:02:32] that right in order for me to be
[1:02:33] redeemed in order for me to be brought

[1:02:52] leav does everybody understand this is
[1:02:54] the leaven that I got got right here
[1:02:57] scripture Paul said to Wi the Redemption
[1:02:59] of the body right there's when the full
[1:03:03] Redemption takes place can I say it that
[1:03:05] way right the rest of me has been
[1:03:07] changed if you want the truth it has all
[1:03:10] I'm waiting for now is a body
[1:03:12] change that's all I'm waiting for cuz
[1:03:15] this thing right here's leav it was born

[1:03:24] the same way they didn't come by a holy
[1:03:26] Veil they came by a lust Veil is that
[1:03:29] what he said no wonder he said the woman
[1:03:32] was the tree of death right
[1:03:35] amen bless was the two loaves wheat yes
[1:03:39] what did these represent he said barley
[1:03:41] is feed to the animals
[1:03:43] well you know I didn't I didn't go with
[1:03:45] that I knew what it was and he wasn't
[1:03:47] going to take it anyway weed is for man
[1:03:50] it shows transformation from animal to
[1:03:52] man which is
[1:03:54] true is didn't brother Ram say we had a
[1:03:57] transformation you know we everything I
[1:03:59] don't know about you brother and you
[1:04:01] guys I went down here yesterday in your
[1:04:03] Bible study they talking about
[1:04:04] sanctification every message I read is
[1:04:06] on a new birth now right transformation
[1:04:09] isn't that something that was changed if
[1:04:11] you're transform from AC to DC or DC to
[1:04:13] a is that a change right I every message
[1:04:16] I invisible Union exactly uh stature of
[1:04:19] a perfect man brother said you don't
[1:04:21] even get to start up this till you have
[1:04:22] the new B till you've been changed is
[1:04:25] that right right I told him last place I
[1:04:27] pre you know what the problem is we got
[1:04:29] a bunch of preachers ain't got the new
[1:04:30] birth pretty rough isn't it how can you
[1:04:33] preach strange you know if brother R
[1:04:35] said for a woman if you had the Holy
[1:04:37] Ghost cut your hair the Holy Ghost won't
[1:04:40] let you cut your hair you understand it
[1:04:42] sisters if you say you believe the
[1:04:44] message of the hour and you do things
[1:04:47] that this message says you shouldn't do
[1:04:50] oo go ahead is that right uh you better
[1:04:54] go check up so what you
[1:04:56] God just didn't send this message to
[1:04:58] tingle your ears right this message is
[1:05:01] to be lived it's to be a testimony this
[1:05:03] prophecy has to become a testimony in
[1:05:06] the people and if it don't become a
[1:05:08] testimony all you did is you heard God
[1:05:10] sent a prophet and you heard his message
[1:05:13] but you better get to the point where
[1:05:14] you're testifying testimony a live life
[1:05:17] of the prophecy right God wants Prophecy
[1:05:20] with flesh on it's what he wants can I
[1:05:22] just say it that way okay that was the
[1:05:25] end of the convers ation I had with him
[1:05:27] but I just wanted to give you a quick
[1:05:28] review on some of the things I thought
[1:05:30] you know that's what I've been teaching
[1:05:31] in the church so what I'm going to take
[1:05:32] you to now is the Passover and I'm just
[1:05:34] going to do it real quick and I'm going
[1:05:36] to really stick with Tabernacles here if
[1:05:38] I can the Feast of the Passover right
[1:05:41] right A lot of people don't understand
[1:05:43] you think and I I it's kind of I
[1:05:45] wondered about this myself the Passover
[1:05:48] it talks about every male had to be at
[1:05:51] the Feast of unleaving do you know the
[1:05:53] Feast of unleaving you know it was 7
[1:05:55] days right the day after the Passover
[1:05:57] for seven days you got to have all your
[1:05:59] unle go read it though the day of the
[1:06:01] Passover they got the leav out of the
[1:06:03] house then they didn't wait till the day
[1:06:06] of unleaving you understand so the
[1:06:08] Passover when the blood was applied the
[1:06:10] first time you believe the message of
[1:06:12] the hour and you applied the blood over
[1:06:14] your doorpost right you had to get the
[1:06:16] leing out is that right do you know how
[1:06:18] they did it they would take a candle
[1:06:20] pretty good a't it Seven Candle golden
[1:06:22] candlesticks if you were in the age of
[1:06:24] Luther you'd take Luther's life and you
[1:06:27] went every room of your heart and You'
[1:06:29] have got the leav out is that right now
[1:06:31] we know Luther had a dip for his age he
[1:06:33] had part word can I tell you that he did
[1:06:37] but the people in Luther's day had to
[1:06:39] take the candle light of that age and in
[1:06:42] the heart they had to go and take they
[1:06:43] had to take a breadcrumb that was in a
[1:06:45] corner of a room and get it out you know
[1:06:48] what they did when they found leing you
[1:06:49] know what they did with it yeah they
[1:06:52] burn it right that's what I told you
[1:06:54] remember when you were in a Baptist and
[1:06:56] they got you all crazed up with Doctrine
[1:06:59] or wherever you come from all of us
[1:07:01] practically come from a denominational
[1:07:03] church somewhere so we had some leaven
[1:07:05] in us right so before the P you need to
[1:07:07] get start getting rid of that stuff you
[1:07:09] know you got to apply the blood over the
[1:07:11] doorpost the heart right you got to get
[1:07:13] all the leavening out is that right now
[1:07:16] it's a process it's going to be seven
[1:07:18] days I'm kind of like you you know
[1:07:20] you're not you may sit around here and
[1:07:21] smoke cigarettes for a while but if you
[1:07:24] truly scripture says if you truly are
[1:07:27] Justified you're going to be glorified
[1:07:29] if you come to true sanc or
[1:07:31] justification that true justification is
[1:07:34] going to take you to sanctification that
[1:07:36] true sanctification is going to take you
[1:07:37] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:39] that's going to bring you to the person
[1:07:40] of Jesus Christ tabernacling in you is
[1:07:43] what it is is that right that's what the
[1:07:44] message of the hour says so we see the
[1:07:47] Feast of Passover get the Le out to
[1:07:50] apply the blood do you know they took
[1:07:52] what they applied the blood with was hup
[1:07:55] you know
[1:07:56] grew everywhere and you say well they
[1:07:58] heal people down they have healings in
[1:08:00] the Baptist Church it grows everywhere
[1:08:02] folks is that what he said his up grows
[1:08:05] everywhere it's in the Baptist Church
[1:08:07] it's in the Lutheran Church brother said
[1:08:09] it's mine and your fault they didn't
[1:08:11] hear it right you know there's going to
[1:08:12] be people in Lutheran Church going to go
[1:08:14] through tribulation and I'm I believe
[1:08:15] they'll come up the white Throne
[1:08:17] judgment why because the blood is still
[1:08:19] applied is that right remember he
[1:08:22] applied seven blood 7,000 years the
[1:08:25] blood is still applied through the amen
[1:08:29] Millennium to the white Throne judgment
[1:08:31] is that right the blood is still there
[1:08:33] there was one brother I don't remember
[1:08:34] who you were now but he talked about
[1:08:36] sanctification how you had to be sanc
[1:08:39] and it's true Sanctified every day of
[1:08:40] your life do you know there was a blood
[1:08:42] offering gave for every one of the seven
[1:08:45] feasts so it means sanctification is
[1:08:48] ongoing you understand it don't matter
[1:08:51] where you're at in the feast you got to
[1:08:53] have the blood of life you have to have
[1:08:55] have sanctification is that right it's
[1:08:58] the truth and that's what it's showing
[1:09:00] every one of the feast days there was a
[1:09:02] blood sacrifice given right but in the
[1:09:05] Feast of Passover they would take his up
[1:09:08] they couldn't just take a piece of the
[1:09:10] hiss up
[1:09:11] plant they took the whole plant yeah
[1:09:14] that's the rule do you understand when
[1:09:16] you come to the true Passover and you
[1:09:19] get this message of the hour this faith
[1:09:22] that has been given in this day you
[1:09:24] can't take a piece of it you got to take
[1:09:27] the whole whole revelation of the hour
[1:09:31] and apply the blood to your door poost
[1:09:34] you understand so you this is not a
[1:09:36] cafeteria style you can't take part of
[1:09:40] this and leave part of it you got to
[1:09:42] take the whole message of the hour and
[1:09:46] apply the blood is what you do so
[1:09:49] there's an important part of the Feast
[1:09:51] of Passover right amen so the next day
[1:09:54] was the Feast of unleavened bread right
[1:09:57] okay what they did they took a piece of
[1:10:00] unleavened
[1:10:01] bread no leavening in it is that right
[1:10:05] you had to and it was wheat you
[1:10:08] understand that right you had to put
[1:10:09] water in it and I read it up how how how
[1:10:12] you had Coast your unleavened bread you
[1:10:14] had to before 17 minutes put that thing
[1:10:16] in the heat right right because if you
[1:10:19] put water in wheat and you leave it
[1:10:21] there it will start Rising on its own
[1:10:24] why cuz it's got in it okay now you
[1:10:28] understand what I'm saying but what they
[1:10:29] do they take that they' put it and cook
[1:10:31] it before they did it they take a fork
[1:10:34] and they put stripes on it right was he
[1:10:36] beat with stripes was he yes was he the
[1:10:40] unleavened bread yes there was no s you
[1:10:43] understand and then he put it in the
[1:10:45] oven is that
[1:10:46] right does everybody understand that's
[1:10:48] what the UNL bread is and then you had
[1:10:50] to partake of that exactly is that right
[1:10:53] you had to eat the unleavened bread
[1:10:55] every day there's been given remember it
[1:10:57] was seven days the unleavened bread
[1:11:00] every Church age there was unleavened
[1:11:01] bread given in the days of Luther
[1:11:04] justification was the unleavened bread
[1:11:06] of that dayly now he had some he smoked
[1:11:09] a pip and drank a beer so you know he
[1:11:12] didn't have it all I'm going to tell you
[1:11:14] that like I said he had part the part
[1:11:16] that God allocated the part that he gave
[1:11:18] in that age Luther stayed true to it is
[1:11:21] that right there was no leav in that
[1:11:23] justification we still believe
[1:11:25] justification today is that right we
[1:11:28] really do I believe the new birth
[1:11:30] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:11:31] the Holy Ghost right that's what it is
[1:11:34] so I still believe in it so for seven
[1:11:36] days seven Church ages there could be no
[1:11:38] Leen found right does everybody agree
[1:11:40] with that amen now we're going to go to
[1:11:42] the fruit first fruits and and I want to
[1:11:45] kind of back up and show you in order to
[1:11:48] start the feast the high priest would go
[1:11:51] out every day into the field Y and he
[1:11:54] would check
[1:11:56] the crop to see if that barley had green
[1:11:58] ears on it right now remember he said
[1:12:00] Jesus was a green tree right exactly old
[1:12:03] dry one like us right the old wheat can
[1:12:05] I put it that way but he' check for
[1:12:08] green ears cuz then the priest would say
[1:12:10] it's time to start the feast when he'
[1:12:12] seen that barley was ready right it was
[1:12:15] time to start the feast like I told the
[1:12:17] church what did Brother R say it's
[1:12:19] holding this whole thing up us the field
[1:12:22] the crops the wheat The Barley we're
[1:12:24] holding this thing up do you understand
[1:12:27] God ain't holding it up he's waiting on
[1:12:28] us brother we keep thinking we're
[1:12:30] waiting on God God's waiting on us is
[1:12:33] what it is amen is that right so he
[1:12:35] could declare the feast that the feast
[1:12:37] would start what they would do is they
[1:12:39] would take the out of the corner of the
[1:12:41] crop or wherever it was rip first they
[1:12:44] would take pull up some barley and then
[1:12:47] they would take it into the temple did
[1:12:49] you know that yeah and they would beat
[1:12:51] it with a rod do you know they beat that
[1:12:54] with a rod
[1:12:55] yeah to get one r y yeah is that right
[1:13:00] right then they wave that R over the
[1:13:02] rest of the crop exactly is that right
[1:13:04] amen is that what they did right they
[1:13:06] would wave it over there it was three
[1:13:08] and a half how many years was Jesus
[1:13:10] ministry right that was the fruit of his
[1:13:13] ministry wasn't it what did he wave over
[1:13:15] the crop three and A2 year Ministry did
[1:13:18] Brother Ram say in a rising of the sh
[1:13:20] Sun that the wave sheath has been waved
[1:13:23] again in our day what did he wave over 3
[1:13:25] and 1/2 years of ministry down here now
[1:13:27] we have the seven the Messiah week you
[1:13:29] know how I believe Daniel 70 weeks I
[1:13:32] tell people I said you need to go read
[1:13:33] it again you need to understand what
[1:13:35] brother B was talking about you know
[1:13:38] people like I told him I said how are
[1:13:39] you going to know the whole purpose of
[1:13:41] Daniel's 70 weeks was to tell us we're
[1:13:43] at the end that's right how else would
[1:13:46] you if brother BR said Israel's our time
[1:13:48] piece how would I know it's truly the
[1:13:50] end time brother Bram had to preach
[1:13:52] Daniel 70 weeks to prove to me were at
[1:13:55] the end and without a shadow of a doubt
[1:13:57] we're at the end but you know there's a
[1:13:59] messiah week in there is that right and
[1:14:03] you know what I've received that Messiah
[1:14:05] week and like I told you I don't know if
[1:14:07] I preach I think I preached a parable
[1:14:08] here a parable has two parts it has a
[1:14:11] part he tells it and that's what he did
[1:14:13] when he was here but there's a mystery
[1:14:14] left on it that's right and this day the
[1:14:16] mystery of God is finished The Parables
[1:14:18] have come together I have taken at our
[1:14:20] church all 40 Parables and preached them
[1:14:22] out of the message of the hour there
[1:14:25] there is no mystery left in this is what
[1:14:26] I'm trying to tell you you understand so
[1:14:29] that that first fruits was that that
[1:14:31] came to fruition first was waved over
[1:14:34] the people that was Jesus Christ what do
[1:14:36] you think was waved over the people in
[1:14:37] the end time Jesus Christ people will
[1:14:40] say it's William brandom it's Jesus
[1:14:42] Christ it's the son of man that's been
[1:14:44] waved over you here in the end time you
[1:14:46] understand right it's a truth it was the
[1:14:49] son of man that was La over me and I'm
[1:14:51] going to be just like that is that right
[1:14:53] brother said she is him
[1:14:55] Glory boy I love that you know the more
[1:14:58] I say it the more I like it but you know
[1:15:00] when I first started saying my flesh
[1:15:02] would jump because remember there's that
[1:15:04] guy there's where that leav is right
[1:15:06] here but inside my heart and my spirit
[1:15:09] it says Amen to the word of God is that
[1:15:11] right I'll line right up to it this is
[1:15:13] the guy this is the black dog right here
[1:15:15] that brother BR was talking about if I
[1:15:17] feed that in there more than I feed this
[1:15:19] I win the white dog if I feed this guy
[1:15:22] this guy will win you understand that's
[1:15:25] why you better quit Fe and I'll tell you
[1:15:27] what I tell the church about neurotic I
[1:15:29] went one day I was going to preach a
[1:15:30] message on neurotic okay so I was going
[1:15:32] to preach it I went to all the
[1:15:34] psychological journals and looked up
[1:15:36] neurotic you know what they said about
[1:15:37] it it's no longer a valid analysis you
[1:15:40] know why everybody's in
[1:15:43] neotic didn't brother random say they
[1:15:45] were one in 63 they're one degree away
[1:15:47] from Insanity you know he explained what
[1:15:50] neurotic was is a guy that pulled around
[1:15:52] in going 92 mph to get home to set for
[1:15:55] an hour to wait on a meal that his wife
[1:15:56] was cooking and let me ask you so do we
[1:15:59] get caught up in the we if we're not
[1:16:02] careful I told the church we need to
[1:16:04] slow down right we get so fastpaced we
[1:16:07] don't read our Bible am I telling you
[1:16:09] the truth we don't read our Bible we
[1:16:12] don't read the books we don't get in the
[1:16:14] Tes we don't even pray enough why
[1:16:17] neurotic right you can get caught up in
[1:16:19] that this white dog will get caught up
[1:16:21] in that run here run there we do this do
[1:16:23] and I ask him why why do you have to do
[1:16:26] it ask yourself why right sometimes you
[1:16:29] know when Daniel Daniel it says they'd
[1:16:31] be running to and fro he prophesied of
[1:16:33] being neurotic is that right isn't that
[1:16:36] what brother R said neurotic was right
[1:16:38] they're running to and fro there's your
[1:16:39] definition of neurotic right right so I
[1:16:42] got on Feast of first FRS now I'm going
[1:16:44] to go to Feast of
[1:16:45] Pentecost Pentecost we know is a seven
[1:16:48] Church brother say it's the long Feast
[1:16:50] does everybody understand that it is the
[1:16:52] long Feast it's the church ages 2000
[1:16:55] years is a feast of Pentecost can I tell
[1:16:56] you that seven time seven right there
[1:16:59] was seven sabbaths in it every Church
[1:17:02] age a message was preached the people
[1:17:05] come under that message and were laid to
[1:17:07] rest they had a Sabbath in it right
[1:17:10] every one of them it happened that way
[1:17:12] on the 50th the day after the Sabbath
[1:17:15] came a jubilee which is a shout right we
[1:17:18] know that a cry a shout went out right
[1:17:21] we understand that in the message of the
[1:17:22] hour so you had a jubilee now in the
[1:17:25] Jubilee here in the church age if you go
[1:17:28] look at Jubilee and brother Brandon when
[1:17:30] I studied it out brother Brandon would
[1:17:31] talk this Jubilee the same as this
[1:17:33] Jubilee but this golden jubilee is
[1:17:34] different than this Jubilee can I tell
[1:17:36] you that this Jubilee here was you could
[1:17:39] go free right right but you didn't get
[1:17:41] all your possessions back is that right
[1:17:43] right you could go free in the first
[1:17:46] church age under Paul but you didn't get
[1:17:47] your possession back but in the Jubilee
[1:17:50] the golden jubilee when that blew you
[1:17:52] got your possession back and every every
[1:17:55] child of Israel got their land back they
[1:17:57] were all equal on the day of Jubilee no
[1:18:00] wonder there's no great ones Among Us
[1:18:04] the Jubilee says there's no great ones
[1:18:06] Among Us does everybody understand that
[1:18:08] the Jubilee another rule of Jubilee just
[1:18:10] to explain it to you is do you know that
[1:18:12] God said the land is
[1:18:15] mine he never said the land is yours
[1:18:18] right the land is mine does everybody
[1:18:20] agree he said you can possess the land
[1:18:24] what did Brother say you're the he
[1:18:26] was Christ exactly see the land's not
[1:18:30] yours but you possess the land my
[1:18:33] theophany is in there folks you
[1:18:35] understand I tell people what happens to
[1:18:37] a lot of people they're looking for
[1:18:38] something to happen brother said one day
[1:18:41] one of those lights are going to come
[1:18:42] pick you up it has you know what that
[1:18:45] light that Lo has come down into me and
[1:18:47] has picked me up as what it is I'm not
[1:18:50] waiting for a Rapture I am the rapture
[1:18:55] is that right right so there's your 50
[1:18:57] days your every day they put them to
[1:18:59] rest is that right then we come to a
[1:19:01] jubilee we're in that Jubilee time right
[1:19:03] now is that right so I can show you is
[1:19:06] the Passover still good today yes is the
[1:19:09] unleavened bread yes I don't have any
[1:19:11] leening in this message of the hour
[1:19:12] that's right like I say you get a
[1:19:14] preacher that brings some leing their
[1:19:15] own ideas you better run from that guy
[1:19:18] exctly is that right why because I'm
[1:19:19] feasting under the unleavened bread I'm
[1:19:21] in that Feast you understand I'm in the
[1:19:23] Feast of first fr fruits is that right
[1:19:25] he's Arisen in my heart exactly and then
[1:19:28] the Feast of Pentecost I guarantee you
[1:19:30] I've had a Pentecostal experience is
[1:19:32] that right then now what I want to show
[1:19:34] you those Fe the first three feasts are
[1:19:37] absolutely Jesus
[1:19:39] Christ okay the next one is the church

[1:19:51] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:19:53] Sher exactly you know see people in the
[1:19:56] message said now remember the trumpets

[1:23:32] you trim the front of here yeah a little
[1:23:34] girl yeah you got to be kidding me yeah
[1:23:37] you know brother R told about these
[1:23:38] women who were 60 years old trying to be
[1:23:40] a little girl is that what we got around
[1:23:42] the message the grow up sister come on
[1:23:45] right amen you you see you need to grow
[1:23:47] up right right right sure you do so
[1:23:51] there's your Feast of trumpets right
[1:23:53] then we're going to talk about the day
[1:23:54] of a atonement you know the day of
[1:23:56] atonement was when they Afflicted their
[1:23:58] souls right do you go look at that word
[1:24:00] Afflicted they humbled themselves right
[1:24:02] did you know that y see if you're really
[1:24:05] if you're really under that day of
[1:24:06] atonement you're in that Feast you're
[1:24:08] going to humble yourself right I know he
[1:24:10] told me he said well he can't take a man
[1:24:12] who's arrogant well yeah because we're
[1:24:14] under the feet we're under the day of
[1:24:15] atonement this is the day of atonement
[1:24:18] do you understand what I'm saying right
[1:24:20] so what do you we don't like anybody
[1:24:21] that's arrogant you're going to Humble I
[1:24:23] told the church the more God reveals
[1:24:25] this message to me the humbler it makes
[1:24:26] me if you got a revelation it ain't
[1:24:29] going to give you now I got a big head I
[1:24:31] apologize it's the natural but I said if
[1:24:33] that preacher's got a big head and all
[1:24:35] puffed up he's got Le and now what L
[1:24:38] does it Puffs your old head up is what
[1:24:39] it does right that's what we got around
[1:24:42] the message of the hour we got a bunch
[1:24:43] of preachers all puffed up they don't
[1:24:45] they're not humble is that right but if
[1:24:48] you got the day of atonement you're
[1:24:50] going to afflict your soul you're going
[1:24:52] to be a humble humble man right now one
[1:24:55] thing about the day of atonement I
[1:24:56] really want to explain to you do you
[1:24:58] know the day of atonement there was only
[1:25:00] one priest in there one yeah one there
[1:25:05] wasn't brother random of Jesus Christ in
[1:25:07] there does everybody understand what I'm
[1:25:09] saying there was one he was the high
[1:25:12] priest exactly do you know he had 15
[1:25:14] sacrifices he did that one day he did it
[1:25:19] alone you understand he did it alone in
[1:25:22] there Jesus Christ died died alone amen
[1:25:26] there was no disciple around him do you
[1:25:28] understand that on that day of atonement
[1:25:30] there was not one person there doing any
[1:25:32] work there was only one doing the work
[1:25:35] it was Jesus Christ and that's the big
[1:25:37] part of atonement that you need to
[1:25:39] understand that's why it'll humble you
[1:25:42] when you realize it's not by works least
[1:25:44] any man could boast that's right there's
[1:25:46] no Works in this you understand what I'm
[1:25:48] saying your works is an expression of
[1:25:50] your faith now I believe faith without
[1:25:52] works is dead so if you say you believe
[1:25:55] the message of hour and you don't bring
[1:25:57] forth works you are d e a d exactly is
[1:26:00] that what the scripture says it's the
[1:26:02] truth so the day of atonement is what he
[1:26:05] diden what he did right is that right
[1:26:09] Amen in Revelation 10 1-6 is that what
[1:26:12] brother brandham did could he open the
[1:26:15] book it was what he did does everybody
[1:26:17] understand it's what Christ did for me
[1:26:20] not what William brandham did and I love
[1:26:22] William brandom I want to shake his hand
[1:26:24] the other side if there's ever a man
[1:26:26] that gave himself up for a people it's
[1:26:27] him exactly he lived an example of a
[1:26:30] life did he not right I love him I
[1:26:32] really do but he's not he didn't make my
[1:26:36] atonement I'm not going to worship
[1:26:38] William brandom I'm going to worship
[1:26:39] Jesus Christ because he did it alone he
[1:26:42] died alone is that right that's exactly
[1:26:45] there's your day of atonement now we're
[1:26:47] going to come to the Feast of
[1:26:49] Tabernacles now A Feast of Tabernacles
[1:26:52] does anybody know when brother Brandon

[1:28:04] preached right brother brandham was
[1:28:06] telling us and about the feast the
[1:28:08] Tabernacles does everybody agree with
[1:28:10] that right amen the statue of a perfect
[1:28:12] man was preached the day before the
[1:28:15] Feast of Tabernacles was to start amen
[1:28:18] so what did Brother Brandon preach the
[1:28:20] statue of a perfect man is the Feast of
[1:28:22] Tabernacles amen right it is the Feast
[1:28:25] of Tabernacles does everybody understand
[1:28:27] that so if you want to understand what
[1:28:31] the Feast of Tabernacles was go read the
[1:28:33] statue of a perfect man amen is that
[1:28:36] right look at his look at his title even
[1:28:38] as they call it statue of a perfect man
[1:28:40] but listen to what he said and this
[1:28:42] morning we want to speak on a subject or
[1:28:44] teach rather if we can building the
[1:28:46] living Tabernacle amen building the
[1:28:49] building the living Tabernacle of the
[1:28:52] living God's Dwelling Place
[1:28:54] the perfect man the living Tabernacle
[1:28:57] the now existent Tabernacle right of the
[1:29:00] Living God where he
[1:29:03] dwells so brother Brandon when he
[1:29:06] preached stature of a perfect man he was
[1:29:09] preaching under the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:29:11] does everybody understand that do you
[1:29:13] know brother brand in Feast of the
[1:29:14] trumpets he said we are now feasting
[1:29:18] under the Feast of Tabernacles does
[1:29:21] everybody know he said that you think he
[1:29:23] just said that to saying that no what
[1:29:26] was brother Brandon doing now he's going
[1:29:27] to bring somebody by the preaching of
[1:29:30] the Gospel right is that right he's
[1:29:32] going to bring a man the stature of a
[1:29:35] perfect man and you know what you can't
[1:29:38] even start here without being having a
[1:29:40] new birth right come on did Brother
[1:29:41] brand call it the divine nature go look
[1:29:44] at what he says here it's a divine
[1:29:46] nature is what it is is that right so
[1:29:49] God can't even start the growth until
[1:29:51] you get a new birth now a baby tell now
[1:29:54] it it grows so big in the mother's womb
[1:29:57] right is that right so you could be in
[1:29:58] the church out here you can have a
[1:30:01] spirit right you can have a body but you
[1:30:04] still areen a living Soul until you get
[1:30:07] the new birth you understand what I'm
[1:30:08] saying you do not there's something's
[1:30:11] got to die in you because your first
[1:30:13] birth was not right you were born under
[1:30:16] a lust Veil not a holy Veil Eve walked
[1:30:19] away from that Holy Veil if she have
[1:30:21] stayed behind the word that was the Holy
[1:30:24] is that right we' have come the right
[1:30:26] way we' have been spoken into existence
[1:30:28] by the spoken word is the original them
[1:30:31] but you know what I come by a lust Veil
[1:30:34] is what I did this is what you say in
[1:30:36] the
[1:30:38] ugly you know in the Feast of
[1:30:40] Tabernacles they were going it was on
[1:30:42] their Journey did you know that and you
[1:30:44] know we show them and I don't know if
[1:30:46] you got one here we show these n real
[1:30:48] fancy tents you see them nice looking
[1:30:50] tents when they do it they were booths
[1:30:53] right they were foursided booth that
[1:30:55] they'd fold up and take the rule of the
[1:30:58] Feast of Tabernacles it had to be a
[1:31:00] temporary
[1:31:02] Booth a temporary dwelling is that right
[1:31:05] it's a temporary dwelling this is a
[1:31:07] temporary dwelling I live in this is the
[1:31:10] tab Feast of Tabernacles you know the
[1:31:12] rule of that is that when I looked up I
[1:31:15] had to be able to see at least one star
[1:31:18] and I have I have seen his star and I
[1:31:21] have come to worship Him Do You Realize
[1:31:24] that's what it is the Three Wise Men
[1:31:26] followed a star I followed a star too is
[1:31:29] that right and even a day star has
[1:31:31] arisen in my heart the New Birth has
[1:31:33] happened with me you understand so now I
[1:31:36] can start a growth pattern up is that
[1:31:39] right and these things right here do you
[1:31:41] know brother there's one word in statute
[1:31:43] of a perfect man he used he never used
[1:31:44] anywhere
[1:31:45] else anybody know what the word
[1:31:48] is vulcanized you ever looked it up yeah
[1:31:53] you ever look
[1:31:54] you're an old guy you he's an old guy
[1:31:57] I'm an old guy there's some other old
[1:31:59] guys here too remember we as kids we had
[1:32:01] a bicycle time and you had to patch it
[1:32:04] right we didn't use this man-made glue
[1:32:06] stuff they got now this organizational
[1:32:09] stuff they got out there we didn't use
[1:32:10] it did we what you do you take a scraper
[1:32:13] and you'd have to scrape it see when you
[1:32:15] come to the New Birth it ain't going to
[1:32:16] be easy boys you're going to get some
[1:32:18] scraping you're going to get some things
[1:32:20] scraped off of you going to rough you up
[1:32:22] a little because he's going to put that
[1:32:24] that patch on you and that patch is the
[1:32:27] same material as a tire does everybody
[1:32:29] understand that so what he's going to do
[1:32:31] he's going he's going to scrape her down
[1:32:33] then he's going to put that patch on you
[1:32:34] and there's four little screws pressure
[1:32:36] right and he's going to pressure you
[1:32:38] down is that right he going to pressure
[1:32:41] you down now that ain't all of it now
[1:32:43] guess what he's going to do he's going
[1:32:44] to take a match right and he's going to
[1:32:46] put it right in the middle of that thing
[1:32:48] right in the middle of it I remember
[1:32:49] when I was a kid you didn't put it over
[1:32:51] on the edge you put it in the middle of
[1:32:52] that patch didn't you you break it open
[1:32:55] and when it did guess what the patch me
[1:32:59] and the tire became one does it not say
[1:33:01] in Ezekiel wherever the wheel and the
[1:33:03] wheel went I went with him exactly why
[1:33:06] because I was vulcanized to that do you
[1:33:08] realize the stature of a perfect man is
[1:33:10] when you and him are one you watch how
[1:33:13] many times after brother Brandon
[1:33:14] preached that message he started saying
[1:33:15] she is him why he use the word
[1:33:18] vulcanized okay right so what it is
[1:33:20] you're vulcanized to the wheel does
[1:33:22] everybody understand that in 1963 what
[1:33:25] come down the wheel and the will am who
[1:33:27] was in the middle of it Jesus Christ
[1:33:29] there were four living creatures it came
[1:33:31] through eternity is that right spinning
[1:33:33] from eternity is that where it came from
[1:33:36] and you know what you got vulcanized to
[1:33:37] That Glory you understand in 1960 you
[1:33:40] were vulcanized today that's what you
[1:33:42] were and now I can say she is him I can
[1:33:45] read this message of the hour and say
[1:33:46] she is him if she is him he's the word
[1:33:49] you're the word right right I count it
[1:33:52] not robbery to be equal with God is that
[1:33:54] what the scripture says so the whole

[1:35:41] revelation in this hour a fire down in
[1:35:44] me you understand what I'm saying a
[1:35:47] pyramid and you know what you go look at
[1:35:49] the pyramids over there if you look at
[1:35:51] the pyramid you see in the picture now
[1:35:53] what you you got is a bunch of rough
[1:35:54] stones have you ever seen it do you know
[1:35:57] that on that pyramid was smooth stones
[1:35:58] at one time you know they came in and
[1:36:01] they they chiseled and burnt and got
[1:36:03] that smooth Stones off now let me tell

[1:36:09] up the rough Stones you were rough yeah
[1:36:13] you carried a club on your back you were
[1:36:15] the Rough Stones is that right so when
[1:36:18] he built the Tabernacle what did he
[1:36:20] build it out of first the rough Stones
[1:36:22] the Jews rejected him right so he took a
[1:36:25] a gentile for his for his name's sake
[1:36:27] right a bride what's he doing rough and
[1:36:30] we're rough buddy yeah we Gentiles are
[1:36:32] rough that's right is that right rough
[1:36:36] but it's Tabernacles remember y so
[1:36:39] there's where the next thing that they
[1:36:40] put on it was smooth Stones yeah now the
[1:36:42] rough Stones there's approximately 2.5
[1:36:44] million but they don't know how many
[1:36:45] there are the Gentiles aren't numbered
[1:36:49] the rough stones but then the finished
[1:36:51] Stones went on do you know how many of
[1:36:52] them there are

[1:36:59] tell me God hasn't built that pyramid in
[1:37:01] the day we're in the Gentiles are the
[1:37:03] rough stones and then the next Bunch
[1:37:06] that's coming back are the Jews that's
[1:37:07] going to be the smooth Stone it ain't
[1:37:09] going to take him 2,000 years to take me
[1:37:12] and polish like he's said to polish me
[1:37:13] and you up he don't have to polish out
[1:37:16] them trinitarian Doctrine I mean they
[1:37:18] stick a needle through a word a Bible
[1:37:20] and know where it's at right so it ain't
[1:37:22] going to take him 2,000 years to polish
[1:37:24] them up they're already pretty polished
[1:37:25] up right but they're going to find out
[1:37:28] right exactly and that's what's going to
[1:37:30] complete the pyramid now I'm going to
[1:37:31] tell you that pyramid City that comes up

[1:37:35] bride and the
[1:37:39] 144,000 brother renom was telling us in

[1:39:23] thing that survived it right the only

[1:39:26] thing is the pyramid The Dwelling Place
[1:39:29] of the Living God that's you are the
[1:39:31] ones that's going to survive it you
[1:39:32] understand amen it's the truth so you
[1:39:35] got the Feast of Tabernacles do you know
[1:39:37] let's go to St John 7 if you
[1:39:40] would I'm moving along pretty good see
[1:39:43] you're easy to preach to CU you've been
[1:39:45] taught you understand let's go to
[1:39:48] Ephesians 4 first would you do you know
[1:39:51] brother brandom there was only two
[1:39:52] places
[1:39:54] that he used the text of Ephesians 4
[1:39:57] yeah do you know that you know where it
[1:40:01] was where he used the text of Ephesian
[1:40:04] 41-15 there's only two places he used
[1:40:07] that scripture as one of his text
[1:40:09] scriptures you know what it was you must
[1:40:12] be born again and the stature of a
[1:40:15] perfect man what's going to bring you to
[1:40:17] the stature of a perfect man the
[1:40:18] fivefold ministry right amen see that's
[1:40:21] why people I don't understand around the
[1:40:22] message of why they don't put any value
[1:40:24] in a fivefold minister they'll play
[1:40:27] tapes they won't even give them Pastor
[1:40:29] when old Pastor dies I know churches six
[1:40:31] seven years down the road and they're
[1:40:33] bringing preacher in every weekend they
[1:40:34] ain't got a pastor yet well how are they
[1:40:36] going to come in the Statue of a perfect
[1:40:37] man without a pastor it takes the
[1:40:40] fivefold ministry to bring you into a
[1:40:43] stature of a perfect man cuz this guy's
[1:40:46] going to smooth you up you rough
[1:40:48] Gentiles you understand he's going to
[1:40:50] put some cement on you which is love y
[1:40:53] right to get this thing to stick
[1:40:54] together is that right and this ain't no
[1:40:56] man-made see in either this is love
[1:40:58] that's going to see in you got love in
[1:41:01] this brother gar I would to God that
[1:41:04] there' be such a love in a congregation
[1:41:07] that God can sweep down and heal you
[1:41:09] while you're sitting in your seat now
[1:41:11] that's cement buddy that's love that's
[1:41:13] what this church is coming to you
[1:41:16] understand this bride is coming to that
[1:41:18] where the love of God will sweep down
[1:41:19] and heal you set in your sins is that
[1:41:22] right amen sure exactly let's read four
[1:41:25] and what is 11 and he gave some Apostles
[1:41:29] some prophets some evangelists I want
[1:41:31] you to read I'm going to slow down and
[1:41:33] he gave some Apostles semicolon does
[1:41:35] everybody see that right okay and some
[1:41:39] prophets semicolon some evangelists
[1:41:43] semicolon and some pastors and teachers
[1:41:47] your pastor ought to be apt to teach
[1:41:49] right there's no semicolon between that
[1:41:51] office is there's nothing difference
[1:41:53] between a pastor and a teacher some days
[1:41:56] when I come out Sunday morning I say
[1:41:58] look I don't know how it's going to be
[1:41:59] till I get in the Pulpit number one if
[1:42:02] I'm the pastor part I tell them I'm a
[1:42:04] screaming M
[1:42:06] Mei is that right you just let her fly
[1:42:08] buddy but sometimes I come out and when
[1:42:11] I get in the Pulpit the anointing there
[1:42:13] is to be a teacher right with that
[1:42:15] pastoral gift and I've had people
[1:42:18] say somebody's a teacher and I thought
[1:42:21] am I reading that wrong if he's a pastor
[1:42:23] he's supposed to be able to teach what
[1:42:25] are they saying but you can go to
[1:42:27] churches around the message of the hour
[1:42:28] and you can tell when the people aren't
[1:42:30] taught try to preach there I have it's
[1:42:33] like pulling teeth you understand
[1:42:36] there's no pull I'm doing you know what
[1:42:39] I'm saying but when you go to a church
[1:42:41] like this where you're well taught it is
[1:42:42] easy for me to get In a Pulpit and teach
[1:42:45] because why you've been taught do you
[1:42:47] know that under the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:42:50] Jesus went into the temple and taught
[1:42:52] right that was a big thing in St John 7
[1:42:55] look at it and I can't read it cuz I'm
[1:42:58] going to hurry through this cuz I got to

[1:43:47] started reading it again she said you're

[1:44:38] 7 and these things Jesus walked in
[1:44:41] Galilee do you see that word Galilee
[1:44:43] that's important when you read this
[1:44:45] chapter and and if you go home read 71
[1:44:49] through St John 9:7 and you'll get to
[1:44:51] feel for what the Feast of Tabernacle is
[1:44:53] okay it tells you all the attributes of
[1:44:55] it there's just not one attribute to the
[1:44:58] Feast of Tabernacles there's several
[1:44:59] different attributes to it okay but he
[1:45:02] walked in Galilee okay important now the
[1:45:05] Jews Feast of Tabernacles was at hand
[1:45:08] right and they sought to kill him I
[1:45:10] missed that in the first one his
[1:45:12] Brethren his Brethren does everybody
[1:45:14] understand these weren't unbelievers
[1:45:17] these were Brethren that sought The
[1:45:18] Killing we understand that we've been in
[1:45:20] the message there long enough to
[1:45:22] understand that one don't
[1:45:23] his Brethren therefore said unto him
[1:45:25] depart hence and go into Judea that thy
[1:45:28] disciples Also may see the works that
[1:45:30] thou do us see they wanted works right
[1:45:32] right the Jews seeketh after a s
[1:45:35] constantly wanted works for there is no
[1:45:37] man that doeth anything in secret amen
[1:45:40] and he himself seeketh to be known
[1:45:42] openly if thou do these things show
[1:45:44] thyself to the world for neither did his
[1:45:47] Brethren believe in him right they
[1:45:49] didn't believe him all the signs all the
[1:45:52] Miracles they didn't believe him is that
[1:45:54] right now it made a turn his ministry
[1:45:58] he's starting to teach now that's when
[1:46:00] they started haing brother it wasn't
[1:46:02] when he had to First pull second pull
[1:46:04] but when he started speaking the word is
[1:46:07] that right he started teaching the
[1:46:09] message of the hour went out that's when
[1:46:11] they started hating him they hated his
[1:46:13] Doctrine is that right and he told the
[1:46:16] SC the the the uh disciples behold their
[1:46:20] Doctrine that's the leav right they
[1:46:22] hated what Jesus said and what he taught
[1:46:24] is that right I hate what you teach too
[1:46:27] exactly where did I leave off okay thank
[1:46:31] you then Jesus said to them my time is
[1:46:33] not yet come but your time is always
[1:46:35] ready the world cannot hate you but me
[1:46:38] it hateth because I testify of it now
[1:46:41] what is he saying he's separating light
[1:46:43] from dark in the Feast of Tabernacles a
[1:46:46] big attribute of the Feast of
[1:46:47] Tabernacles is light what is light
[1:46:50] Revelation under the Feast of
[1:46:51] Tabernacles did we get get some
[1:46:53] Revelation oh yeah what is it the
[1:46:56] stimulation of Revelation another part
[1:46:58] of the Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of
[1:47:01] Tabernacles when they were gathering in
[1:47:02] the fruit yeah the bread crops was
[1:47:05] during the Feast of Pentecost the
[1:47:07] Jubilee the 50th one the last bread crop
[1:47:09] had been brought in does everybody
[1:47:11] understand that but in the Feast of the
[1:47:12] Tabernacles it was fruit y does
[1:47:15] everybody understand it was fruit that
[1:47:18] was starting to be brought in of the
[1:47:19] Feast of Tabernacles it was what it was
[1:47:22] the olive what do they use olives for
[1:47:25] oil they brought the grapes in what was
[1:47:27] the grape for wine what is this day oil
[1:47:30] and wine touch not right you think the
[1:47:34] devil can touch you only God can allow
[1:47:37] that you understand if something comes
[1:47:39] on you it's simply because God's trying
[1:47:41] to cook some of this into you the whole
[1:47:44] purpose of God is to build a dwelling
[1:47:46] place is that right so if anything is
[1:47:48] allowed upon you you ought to thank God
[1:47:51] for it because all it is is trying to
[1:47:53] give you some Temperance right you
[1:47:55] understand it's trying what did Brother

[1:48:04] still don't have it but I'm will to be
[1:48:06] patient with God cuz he said if I'll ask
[1:48:09] if I believe it you ask it in my name I
[1:48:12] will give it to you brother r s the
[1:48:14] church a but if you'll speak the word I
[1:48:17] will perform it does everybody
[1:48:20] understand all you got to do is be
[1:48:21] patient for God all you got to do is
[1:48:23] thank him for getting it and that what
[1:48:26] brother BR said thank him for
[1:48:28] it that's
[1:48:31] right go ye on up feet yeah when he when
[1:48:35] he had said these words unto them he
[1:48:37] Abode still in Galilee yeah he was in
[1:48:39] Galilee right but when his Brethren were
[1:48:42] gone gone up then went he also up unto
[1:48:45] the feast not openly this is the key to
[1:48:49] the Feast of Tabernacles that's right

[1:52:01] talked to when I went home I preached on
[1:52:03] the Key of David yeah you know what
[1:52:06] brother man said the Key of David is

[1:52:16] understand so I'm not I don't I'm not
[1:52:19] wondering what he is I have a revelation
[1:52:22] I know what he is that's right every day
[1:52:25] I pick up the love letter and the
[1:52:28] message they're all one like I told the
[1:52:31] church if you go to th and I'm no I got
[1:52:33] to hurry I'm not I'm not going to take
[1:52:35] much longer okay do I have all afternoon
[1:52:39] take a
[1:52:40] break there you go there you go so Jesus
[1:52:45] in in St John
[1:52:46] 4 with Nicodemus right he told Nicodemus
[1:52:50] you must be born again is that he told
[1:52:53] him and Nicodemus said this he said can
[1:52:55] I crawl back into my mother's womb you
[1:52:58] know he was thinking terrestrial body he
[1:53:00] was thinking earthy is that right he
[1:53:03] wasn't thinking Heavenly he was thinking
[1:53:05] earthy as what he was exactly but you
[1:53:07] know he said you being a teacher and you
[1:53:10] don't know these things right you don't
[1:53:12] know them but you know what I thought
[1:53:15] well okay well how would he know it what
[1:53:18] scripture said you must be born again
[1:53:20] right Ezekiel 36 right is that right
[1:53:23] exactly now I going to use an example
[1:53:24] Jesus didn't say the exact words of
[1:53:26] Ezekiel he paraphrased the scripture is
[1:53:30] that right he said ye must be born again
[1:53:32] do you know what if I paraphrase the
[1:53:34] message of the hour they'll put you out
[1:53:36] Jesus paraphrased the
[1:53:38] Bible thank you is that right Hallelujah
[1:53:42] I told him as long as I say this message
[1:53:44] there and I keep the continuity on I'm
[1:53:47] okay but Jesus the absolutely my example
[1:53:50] did not quote the scripture
[1:53:52] verba he voted he quoted it with some
[1:53:55] Revelation in it is what he did and when
[1:53:58] I quote this message of the hour I got
[1:54:00] some light on it you understand what I'm
[1:54:02] saying it's not a dead letter so if I
[1:54:04] don't quote every jot and tit of the
[1:54:06] message they say you're not saying what
[1:54:07] brother brandom said I think you note
[1:54:10] you need to go see what he said as long
[1:54:12] as I quote it and I keep the continuity
[1:54:14] of it it's okay because I'm going to be
[1:54:17] honest with you I put some I tell the
[1:54:19] church I put some OK bonics On It come
[1:54:21] on I'm from we have oky bonics there we
[1:54:24] have words we use that you don't use out
[1:54:26] here when he said what do you say that
[1:54:29] read the Bible before they're going to
[1:54:31] what how did you say that I thought
[1:54:33] what's that I didn't know what that was
[1:54:34] that's Georgia bonic to me you
[1:54:37] understand but God he's going to quote
[1:54:39] the message of the hour and he's going
[1:54:41] to put it where you can get the
[1:54:43] revelation of it brother R said his job
[1:54:45] is to get the cool his room and break it
[1:54:48] down so that the people might receive it
[1:54:50] is that what the fivefold is to break it
[1:54:53] down where you can receive it where it
[1:54:56] becomes a part of you where you're
[1:54:57] starting to create a dwelling place for
[1:55:00] God because like we said the logos
[1:55:03] that's in you that new body is going to
[1:55:05] materialize around the word that you got
[1:55:07] in you so every service we're giving him
[1:55:10] word he's feeding you word he's feeding
[1:55:11] you word and one day your body change
[1:55:14] that new body is going to materialize
[1:55:16] around the word that you got in you and
[1:55:18] that word is light you understand it's
[1:55:21] the Feast of Tabernacle where you're at
[1:55:23] right now is that right so the Feast of
[1:55:27] Tabernacles is the feast that yours
[1:55:30] currently under but all the feasts come
[1:55:32] under you have to be a part you got to
[1:55:34] walk Jesus walked up and down through
[1:55:36] all the feast days does everybody
[1:55:38] understand that when he got before the
[1:55:40] priest at age 12 and he taught him in
[1:55:42] the Tabernacle that was the Feast of
[1:55:44] Pentecost is that right so he went to
[1:55:47] the Feast of Passover he went to the
[1:55:49] Feast of Pentecost he went to the Feast
[1:55:51] of Tabernacle there was three
[1:55:53] requirements you had to go to if you
[1:55:55] were an Israelite he made every one of
[1:55:57] them right and you will too Glory that's
[1:56:00] right now let me tell you something you
[1:56:01] ever thought of
[1:56:02] this you got three set times a week

[1:56:33] talk to them and say you know what I
[1:56:35] need to be there where do you think we
[1:56:38] come up in America where there's three
[1:56:39] services a week yeah that is just not
[1:56:42] happen chance you understand what I'm
[1:56:44] saying we have three set times and it
[1:56:48] was expected for every male Jew to be
[1:56:51] there y y
[1:56:53] you think God changes his mind about his
[1:56:55] word your pastor has gave you three set
[1:56:59] times to be

[1:57:05] you need to be
[1:57:07] here and you fix your schedule where you
[1:57:10] will be here that's right right you
[1:57:12] understand right I'm not trying to be a
[1:57:14] legalist but I'm telling you I prove
[1:57:16] that to you in the scripture it's not an
[1:57:18] accident we set three times you work
[1:57:21] your schedule around it where you can be
[1:57:22] in church now we're not going to be so
[1:57:25] dogmatic if you know they got to do
[1:57:26] whatever I had a man a preacher in my
[1:57:29] church come to me he said I'm going to
[1:57:31] take a job he's not there anymore by the
[1:57:34] way I'm going to take a
[1:57:36] job that pays a dollar more an hour but
[1:57:39] I'm not going to be able to be in
[1:57:41] Sunday and he was in my back office
[1:57:43] talking to me I said okay I said no I
[1:57:46] got one question to ask you are you
[1:57:48] going to go out in that church lot after
[1:57:49] service and tell the people that God
[1:57:51] gave you that job he looked at me he
[1:57:54] said no I said good cuz if you did I
[1:57:57] would correct you in front of the people
[1:57:59] God ain't going to give you a job where
[1:58:00] you have to miss church you understand
[1:58:02] what I'm saying if you got a job and you
[1:58:04] switch that job to get a job that you
[1:58:06] got to work on Sundays you better find
[1:58:08] you another job you need to be in
[1:58:10] service does everybody understand there
[1:58:12] is no brother said you got the Holy
[1:58:14] Ghost you can't wait till them Church
[1:58:16] doors open is that right you need to set
[1:58:19] your time and your schedules where you
[1:58:21] can be here to hear the word there's no
[1:58:23] greater privilege that you have as a
[1:58:25] people than to come here and hear the
[1:58:27] word of God where the light is going
[1:58:30] forth and that light will absolutely get
[1:58:32] into your body and it'll become you is
[1:58:35] that right and that's the way that new
[1:58:36] body is going to materialize around you
[1:58:38] is that right exactly a lot of people
[1:58:40] take it for granted coming to church you
[1:58:43] need to be here right I'm not trying to
[1:58:45] be a dogmatic but honestly when I seen
[1:58:48] that I've out had a shout right it's the
[1:58:50] truth he said time where he would know
[1:58:53] that they would put everything aside to
[1:58:54] be there right does everybody understand
[1:58:57] and that's why we do Church three times
[1:58:59] a week you need to be there whatever you
[1:59:03] got to do congregation to be here you
[1:59:05] better start doing it if your job's
[1:59:07] making you miss here you ask God to get
[1:59:09] you a new job cuz you want to be in
[1:59:11] church everybody understand but this
[1:59:13] preacher told me a dollar an hour I said
[1:59:16] okay he works 40 hours a week four times
[1:59:18] I'm pretty good at math 4 time40 $160
[1:59:22] when he preached for me I'd give him
[1:59:24] $200
[1:59:25] check he'd preached three times for me
[1:59:28] he forfeited $600 that he couldn't be
[1:59:30] there on Sunday to preach for me to gain
[1:59:35] $160 does anybody does that make sense
[1:59:37] to anybody I'm the only one that thought
[1:59:39] what in the world are you thinking
[1:59:40] brother man what was it there was
[1:59:44] something else working in his life
[1:59:45] exactly it wasn't long after that he
[1:59:47] left you understand and went back out in
[1:59:48] the world there was the real deal right
[1:59:51] right you understand but you need to be
[1:59:54] here in church right amen you really do
[1:59:56] you need to be brother said you need to
[1:59:58] be at your post to do exactly little why
[2:00:00] I said that that didn't cost you that's
[2:00:02] free you don't have to pay me for
[2:00:03] that but it's the truth isn't it it
[2:00:07] really
[2:00:09] is
[2:00:11] BL let me read a quote so you can
[2:00:14] validate what I said future home so old
[2:00:16] man and old woman don't you be
[2:00:18] discouraged if you are a representation
[2:00:21] up here in this attribute of God he's
[2:00:24] God if you have if you're represented
[2:00:27] here you cannot you're in the Eternal
[2:00:29] and if you cross that seventh day into
[2:00:31] the Eighth Day you got into the Eternal
[2:00:33] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're
[2:00:36] included in this now if you're just
[2:00:38] trusting Upon A S and you said this last
[2:00:41] night a sensation or jumping up and down
[2:00:43] or I appreciate you told them that
[2:00:45] there's a lot of people preachers won't
[2:00:47] tell them that you know that that was
[2:00:49] good so you told them what your
[2:00:50] experience was but you counting on that
[2:00:53] right you were counting when God come
[2:00:55] down on the inside of the inside and you
[2:00:57] got your new birth is that right it's
[2:00:59] not by emotionalism it's not a sensation
[2:01:02] now I believe once you get it you're
[2:01:04] going to have some emotion if you got a
[2:01:06] baby that's a new birth and that baby
[2:01:08] don't cry that's a dead baby so you're
[2:01:10] going the emotionalism S is going to
[2:01:12] come after the birth you understand
[2:01:14] that's right a sensation of jumping up
[2:01:16] down I do this I keep a seventh day I
[2:01:19] don't eat meat and things like that
[2:01:21] that's going to perish in the elect see
[2:01:24] but this is the Eternal this is the
[2:01:27] Eternal the feast after the Feast of
[2:01:29] Tabernacles see the Feast of Tabernacles
[2:01:32] was the last Feast the seventh Feast
[2:01:35] right we're worshiping now exactly under
[2:01:39] the Feast of the Tabernacles that's
[2:01:42] right the seventh Church age right we
[2:01:45] are feasting now right under the the
[2:01:48] Feast of Tabernacles does everybody
[2:01:50] understand that exactly and brother
[2:01:52] Brandon preached this right here to show
[2:01:55] you that right right here so the Feast
[2:01:57] of Tabernacles I can tie it right into
[2:01:59] here brother
[2:02:00] AB is what it is amen and you know when
[2:02:04] you look at the I I and I don't know if
[2:02:06] you looked at the word Tabernacle does
[2:02:08] anybody don't know the word Tabernacle
[2:02:10] is not a masculine word right it's a
[2:02:12] feminist word so that Feast of
[2:02:15] Tabernacles was a type of you right and
[2:02:19] it was a type of Christ lo I come in a
[2:02:20] volume of the book it's WR to me okay
[2:02:23] but that was you you understand that
[2:02:26] Tabernacle in the wilderness Tabernacle
[2:02:28] is a femin
[2:02:30] word that Tabernacle in the wilderness
[2:02:32] was you amen have you ever thought what
[2:02:34] was in that third compartment sure
[2:02:38] Mana Aaron's
[2:02:40] Rod right budded blossomed had fruit on
[2:02:44] it is there fruit in there yeah the law
[2:02:48] you know the law convert the soul is
[2:02:50] that what it says amen got see Jesus
[2:02:53] Christ people think that Jesus Christ
[2:02:55] came did away with the law no he
[2:02:56] fulfilled the law exactly you know
[2:02:58] brother random explained Grace like this
[2:03:00] grace is you got a sign that says 55 mil
[2:03:02] hour you know what Grace is you'll drive
[2:03:05] 50 you know brother random had a quote
[2:03:07] he said that you the bride is the final
[2:03:10] voice to the final age under her
[2:03:13] Messenger right brother BR said don't go
[2:03:16] 55 and you go 56 you're not under your
[2:03:19] messenger see you're here to do one
[2:03:21] thing fulfill this message of the hour
[2:03:24] your
[2:03:25] testimony right is what the prophecy was
[2:03:27] all about that's right and brother R
[2:03:29] said don't do this or your Miss dog meat
[2:03:32] then you won't do it because why you got
[2:03:34] a holy ghost that won't let you do it

[2:07:59] what he said sure resiliency and freedom
[2:08:03] from stickiness yeah and odor Yeah by
[2:08:07] combining additives in the presence of
[2:08:10] heat and
[2:08:14] pressure that's what vulcanized it
