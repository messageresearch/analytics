taking place everywhere but you know what that means we're closer to his coming that's what a day what a day amen good to see everybody house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in Romans 7 where we've been reading remember our thought has been on marriage and divorce but we're taking it into the invisible Union to carry on our thought as to seeing the point of how that we're free from the law and how Grace becomes involved into our lives and remember that now we appreciate the the Memorial Day weekend and everything we appreciate all of the military people that have served and all that are still serving that we can be free and be able to Worship the Lord and all of those that have made the the Great great sacrifice we certainly appreciate them for what they' done to where we could could be here and just pray for one another pray for the the soldiers and the things around the world because they're in an entirely different War now than it used to be it was used to get out and shoot each other but now you don't know who the enemy is a lot of times and everything else it's just taking place and blowing them up on every hand and all like that but just remember these and pray that the Lord would bless amen remember Lord willing Wade will be preaching this coming Wednesday so just keep him in your heart and you know know and Romans 7 any other announcements I generally forget something I had Richard to set the temperature on 70° this morning it was on 70 and everybody said it was hot it run it down to 68 and everybody said it was cold so I said Put it on 70 lock it we'll have to just get along with 70 if we can and you can find it already some doing it you know you know and everything else but we do the best we can but you know you can't do everything to please everybody I said yours ago you know I was down at Disney World one time and I asked a little boy how did he stay cool inside of that big old suit he was in he said he had his own little air conditioner thing in there you know I thought about buying them and bringing them back you know and let everybody sit inside and just turn their own knobs you know to to do but uh we do the best we can all right so don't blame the Heat and all it's just it's just the way it is in life all right Romans 7 father we thank you we love you Lord we thank you for all things thank you most of all for your love and your grace unto us we pray that you would just bless each one bless the militaries we were talking about as they around the world taking Lord the place of us to where that we could be free to speak as we can and Lord we know that one day that'll be taken from us but it won't be on the account of that it'll be on the account of Satan and his doings but we we just appreciate it appreciate the opportunity to be able to stand and speak for you we love you and we we just pray that you'd guide us now as we attempt to speak about you you come on the scene into each one of our hearts and lives remember the sick among us and just touch each one and deliver father in Jesus name amen Romans 7 know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though should be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that you should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit under death now watch it but now we are delivered from the law that being head wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now trying to just get a point you know and I want to stay on this and then the Lord willing maybe next Sunday we'll get over into the invisible Union and start talking about the new birth and the marriage and divorce and the the thing things that's covered there and then going on to law and Grace but remember the prophet of God said this is a point here that's a greater portion of marriage and divorce and explaining how that we are free from the law you know only by the new birth I know that I've made statements that are you know contrary to a lot of people's thinking but I pray that you will believe it or think about it so we think the law ended at Calvary and all like that that's fine Christ is the end of the law what for righteousness them that believes all a person that's not a born again believer is still under the law right see that's that's what's hard to get people to think about cuz we've been taught all of our life you know that the law ended at Calvary well that's good that's right but it only ended there for the Born Again believer everything else is still under the law all right then now the point is going to be so hard to try to accept or belief that we're talking about after you're born again so I want to get this out of the way where I can preach on the new birth and and you know and that way we can hold a point to the to what I want that we talk about after we're born again well the law see the other group says Law's done away with we don't have no law no more we're we're in Grace well then the people at the same time that they're talking about Grace are the most legalistic people that's ever been thought of see why do we want to look at dos and don'ts well don't you believe in living right I do I believe that if you're a born again Christian then Christ will be in your heart to live in you and then if you don't in other words if you go out and live like the devil you are the devil that's why I'm not just a Clos line as we talk about or hire and dress and cloth preacher like that because show me where it's ever done any good I'm just honest I'm honest to you as I can be show me a church that's any better dressed or any better action the women Etc than what's here but yet people think that I'm not against those things I'm against any sin whatsoever in any you me or who it is but I realize that we still are bound by by the human elements that we are you see that's where people are so they become so religious they raise up into an atmosphere and they shout and Glory Hallelujah and everything but then when they come down they can't walk too straight well why not just go about all day being what you are that's right I mean I've worked with these brothers there General Motors for many years and all before we all retired and they can tell you whether I lived any different dire than I live here you know I I just try to be the same well I thought that's what the Christian was supposed to be right I mean when we go you know we we go hunting or something like that we don't run down to the liquor store and get us some beer and stuff and go over and secretly you know drink a little and do this that and the other why because we're not we don't do those things you know old saying goes all but when we get it free we'll let her High down well if you let your high down come and find out it's in your eyes and you can't see Christ then that's just the best way of saying it but that's what I'm trying to get us to see and I just want us to go through some scriptures and just the main thing is to realize one thing that even though we are born again Christians we are still Bound by our legalistic ideas and thoughts because everybody has basically a a way of being if you have talk with Adolf Hitler as as mean as he was he would have probably had some real good side to him because that's a moral part of a human being but you see then you say but brother Dale if I'm born again I'm born again amen but that only deals with the soul it doesn't deal with your body and your spirit see then we've got to see that we've got to bring that under subjection amen we've got to bring these things that we are under subjection to that we just don't go out and live like the devil and claim to be Christians if we live like the devil we are the devil that's sensible but see let let's don't get to a self-righteous situation you know that we don't do this or don't do that we think that makes us some kind of a righteousness there is no righteousness outside of the blood of Jesus Christ amen the Bible says it says filthy rags in the sight of God brother Bram in the Hebrew series said i' hate to think that I was born 5 minutes ago and had to go to heaven on some merriage that I'd have he said because I'd born in sin shap it in iniquity spouse my mother's wound a liar you see then that way then we're not brother brandom that was the point that that when I begin to see the way he was bringing it out I could see that we we were all failing because we were just you know believing this or believing that and he starts laying it down and he says do we sin he said every day he said every day he said but we believe in the atonement is there any of us without sin no well then what's the difference in the little sin or the big sin then we better depend upon the blood of Jesus Christ then to live the best we can is commendable because as I said a moment ago then if we go out and live like the devil we are the devil so it's not a choice it's not a fact that we're trying to do this or trying to be righteous we just be what we are I drink all the liquor I want to don't you I smoke I do all all I want to why because I don't want to see then we we we can't get it to the right place of trying to understand but I hope you following what I'm saying especially like this morning the prophet saying there's no saving power whatsoever in the law he said it's a school Master we'll get to that in a minute it's a policeman to put you in jail there's nothing in the law can get you out of jail you got to serve your sentence you know there's no Grace with it there's no opportunity it only brought a knowledge see before the law remember what we were covering that before the law there was no Record Keeper there was no knowledge point of sin up until the law was given by Moses but I mean you done been 2,000 years plus a good bit you think all of them people in there didn't sin well they would never be judged them people cuz there was no law to be judged by you judg by your own conscience like I was discussing with somebody while ago about it you'd say well The Exodus 19 when they said you know whatever you say do we'll do well that looks good you say well what should they have said they shouldn't have said anything they already said Amen on what God had done told them that they were right he told them they were a royal people a priesthood a great nation and that he always be would be with him they would have said amen thank you Lord no see whatever you want us to do we'll do it then we found out the prophet kep emphasizing what they chose law instead of Grace and God knew did you you understand that God knew what they wanted and he gave them the desires of his heart their heart cuz it was never his will to brought law see but but I don't understand cuz that's written in the Bible and you're trying to say that I didn't say that brother random did you got to fuss with him first you know but then you think about it they made it a book of rules the Bible is not a book of rules it is all the way from Genesis to revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ there not a book of rules in there it's not something that you can find to make yourself better all you can find in there is we accept it right amen see we say when I L I sought the Lord I sought the Lord and the Bible says no man sought God now that's not doing away with the fact that you cried and prayed and fasted no that was you getting yourself out of the way where God could speak to you because that's all fasting is for fasting is to get rid of the flesh you cutting off the needs of the flesh you know and you making it to where you can commit yourself to the Lord see then once you get it then you can see that those Ten Commandments are that whole Bible the Old Testament was a revelation of Jesus Christ just as well as we read of the New Testament because it was showing in Christ right not as a book of rules not as something to to tell us to make us better right they took it and made it that way when you read Thou shalt not kill see you turn it around instead of making it Thou shalt not kill why not read it this way especially to us now a born again Christian should say there's no nature in me to kill there's no desire in me to kill take each commandment and read it like that changes the whole thing and then you'll see brother around and said they didn't get what they thought they got that they got God in letter form and they got what will judge them right the whole world is going to be judged by this Bible you say well then what about those that that's never heard they'll be judged by their moral obligation or their conscious part of them see so they have God has a way of judging a word to judge by but there's no saving power it can only bring us to a knowledge a knowledge that we're Sinners well why would you want that I'm I'm I'm back on this morning I can't leave that part to think about cuz that just amazes me to think that God had given Israel the atonement the sacrifices the the healings the the prophit to lead them and they wanted the Book of Rules they wanted something to do but see my warning is to you and I like this morning is Les Satan tempt you through his subtility as he did Eve through what the Bible says the Simplicity that is in Christ Jesus you say yeah but if you preach it and you don't preach it to to condemn people they'll just go out and do things wrong well no wonder they're lost somebody tell me just you know one of my favorite one of my wife's favorite sayings is you can say something about say well what do you expect them to do they're lost you said my neighbor down there is doing well what do you expect them to do they're lost yeah but they claim to be saved well that don't have nothing to do with you you're not known by your claims you're known by the life you live all right Paul here is explaining that a man as long as he lives he's Bound by the law see that's why when we get to the invisible Union it's going to be so much that we've got to cover it the new birth see the soul can be set free totally justified see then to come through marriage and divorce and see that the things that was wrong was wiped clean and way didn't go on to see that we're not trying in any way as we were reading this morning the prophet talking about making a denomination out of things what about Adam what about Adam we're talking about this morning and when God came down where did he get fig leaves he got them from his wife he got them from her Doctrine right her Doctrine see it started right there we need a covering we need something to do and she thought that that covered her I I think God has a little better Vision than even Superman but I always thought we believe the carnality of thoughts of mind that even of that he could look through walls and everything else you know a lot of people maybe hear that and they wonder what you're talking about was old comic strip character called Superman could fly and everything else it was fictitional just using it to short Point see God knew the desires of the people's heart even though it looked good what they were saying the desire in their heart was to have something to do but don't you believe in living right brother Dale no no not after I saw this message what this Prophet was talking about I don't believe in living right no I believe in being born again and then after I'm born again I'm going to make faults and failures and mistakes Grace is going to have to cover that because if not where is my atonement right that's why the scripture say he that receive the knowledge of the truth now remain us no more sacrifice now I've tried my best to explain that to you in in human terms if I don't know something's wrong I go do it and then I find out it's wrong all right God could wink at my ignorance right but if I do it again there's no sacrifice I've got to repent the first one might have been covered by the blood through ignorance but after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice he said well look at what we've all done all right that's what I'm try my best to preach is to get you and I to be realize one thing we need to repent we need to cry out for repentance I thank God every day for saving my soul don't youen why because I know and realize what I am but see Paul is saying as long as a man liveth all right now he's using the example we'll get back to it when we start on the next message that if you're born again you're supposed to die die right right and then it's no longer I that liveth the Christ that liveth in me but see that is only dealing with the new birth that's in your soul so now this will be the thought for today so I titled it becoming free cuz this is what I want us to think about if we die to ourselves and become born again we can then start does everybody Shake Yourself H you higher sleepy listen to what I'm saying at the time we receive the new birth we can start the process of becoming free right you're not free at just ification you're just repentance you're not free at sanctification that's cleansing process getting ready but when you receive the new birth you just start the process of being free well I I thought the New Birth has set everything free see that's where you got that denominational idea from somebody that's not in the word right you see we start the process of becoming free doesn't the Bible say what being born again how by The Incorruptible word of God not us lining up to get better if you think it's only that if we could get ourselves lined up in the flesh then we do need to just start making records and we'll just take one person at the time you know we'll just write down do's and don'ts well the problem is if you started with me you'd never get off the first one right cuz I'm a human mortal I don't believe that you got to sin no I just know we will they didn't didn't have to sin in the garden but God knew they would they didn't have to want a law but God knew they would see then we're becoming free a process adoption what do you want to call it statue of perfect man whatever you want to talk about put it in there and just see that but you got to start the process by the new birth amen and that'll make the soul Eternal pure perfect totally justified not even the fact of saying that you done it and then was forgiven no it means totally we'll get to it that the real you never did do anything the real you is that new birth that new birth never did do anything that eternal life that we have amen but we you got this other part of us to deal with why do you think we've been here 50 years since the prophet is gone right well we're waiting on you brother Dale we'll get out the Whip and start beating or whatever you know let's get out of here I'm not only getting old I'm getting tired of of our ideas and our thoughts listen let's just go through some scriptures now just just read some scriptures and just think about the scripture of what it's saying so let's go to Romans 8 let's just read the scriptures and just think about it only got a couple of quotes today we got a lot of scripture Romans 81 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus no do we want to stop there right but did we read the rest of the scripture who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so now evidently somebody that is even free of all condemnation is going to still walk after the Flesh and a lot of that is normal living you know well since I got born again boy I don't have no problems or nothing I don't have no lust problem nothing Well procreation take care of that and the problem with that is the preachers that I've heard preach like that has got eight or 10 kids I think they was of course it's always kind of funny they could they holler birth control birth control and had about eight and then all at once they don't have no more they changed their believing you know okay watch now what Paul says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death now the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus the new birth made me free from the law of sin and death so when you're born again you can never die no for what the law could not do and then in that it was weak through the flesh now what does that mean for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh now the law is the letter of God the word now where is the weakness in the flesh you mean has God got a weakness in his flesh and it's not saying that is it it's talking about this flesh right amen right it's talking about you and I who have the new birth but our flesh is weak Paul said the things I would I do not etc etc we'll get to that in a minute but think about it I pray that that we have never made it to the young ones to listen or think about that we've all tried to make us a self-righteous great big thing but to just realize we're all human you know is we're all human we're just saved by grace through faith that way we're not beating on somebody else and all it was weak through the F flesh the flesh couldn't do it the flesh can't keep the law that's right right is it true this flesh always wants to just push over the edge just to her and when the law says 55 56 just push just a little bit right cuz it's weak right we're not Born Again In the Flesh if we was we wouldn't have any trouble with it weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh not sinful in the likeness like us not a sinful body but in the likeness looking like us living like us being and for sin condemn sin in the flesh now he condemned sin in the flesh what is he saying he showed are you listening he showed the flesh could be conquered well but what it was was his flesh didn't have no problem the Bible says that he was tempted in all points as we are brother R said he's even tempted of women now I mean if if if I was the devil that's the guy I'd be picking on right it wouldn't be no challenge to pick on somebody that just flops over in sin and just does anything right but to the one who would challenge me on it and try to control but see he condemns sin in the flesh he showed that we didn't have to sin right good old Baptist we we just have to sin a little bit now where's that at in the Bible you know well we're not all perfect you know I ain't never claimed to be perfect I'm claim to be saved amen that's that's the only thing all right but once why did he do that why did God come down and die In the Flesh that the righteousness of the law nothing wrong with the law as long as we're thinking it's God's word right right that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled where in us what who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now does that look like that there's a whole lot of problems no it looks like this third grade reading we can understand that none of us were capable of living the law and when it was coming to the point then he would have to come and make a way and he did and when he did he brought to a point that he he could live that law himself right but now listen do you think the Pharisees thought he lived a perfect life I remember a few scriptures don't you right well you're you're eating on and you're doing this on the Sabbath and you're not even washing your hands you're just eating without washing do you think he was a perfect person in the eyes of the Pharisees all right then I don't try to be perfect then I just try to be what I am that's just what I try to be I just try to be what I am sure I'm a failure but I believe in an it's moment all right now why then would the law have to be given you know why would the law come into being all right now listen see this may sound like a flip-flop but I'm not so listen it was not God's will to bring the law we read that this morning right all right that's what man wanted right but yet God knew all the time he's going to give the law right he knew he was going to bring the law into being well is anything wrong with the law is there anything wrong with living right come on see that's the way I preach salvation is living right by the word of God but by the spirit within us is anything wrong with doing good no nothing wrong with living good but we order to just realize one thing we can't do it it ourselves right my realizing we can't do it ourselves we've got to have according to the Bible after you're born again an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous what do you need an advocate advocate for if we're so beautiful and perfect like everybody think but you know everybody's got an out because there's no way to win over people anyway like I've always told you about men you there's no need of you arguing with your wife cuz you're not going to win anyway because if you win the argument she's going to say well I'm the weaker vessel you would have know better than take what I said so you lost a battle you know forget it just just go on but listen if God would have you know if if God had have thought we could have made it without the law he wouldn't have brought it into being so now he's going to take what we wanted as a book of rules or something to do and he's going to turn around and with that same law he's going to condemn us to death right and he's going to make us guilty that we can't say anything at judgment you said well brother Dale though we're not going to the white Throne judgment I didn't say that but things have got to be taken care of somewhere so think about it so why was the law why did it come into being if God didn't want to give it you know it wasn't his will to give it but he knew before the world he's going to give it right right he knew before the world we would sin right so he stood as a l slame before the foundation of the world and then when we would come to Earth he would permit the law to come into being and he would make that work for his perfect will because Jesus Christ was the law made alive you agree with with that the word of God Made Alive Now if you'll notice in what we're reading Paul is not talking about just Ten Commandments that's what we think when we say law you say Ten Commandments no the whole word all right but why would he bring the law into being all right go ahead with number two Galatians but the scripture hath concluded all under sin Galatians 3:22 that to Promise by faith of Jesus Christ Christ might be given to them that believe but before Faith came before the new birth right because that's what he's talking about through the promise of faith I given to them that believe the Christian you know but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which would afterwards be revealed though there was no Gra under the law it locked you up in jail it made you guilty Paul said I would not have known lust if it had all the law hadn't said Thou shalt not covet wherefore the law was what our school Master to bring us under Christ that we might be justified by faith now if that scripture is true there is no way to come to Jesus Christ outside of the law condemning you first are you reading it just reading the scripture this is way I read I I like to look at the scriptures and just read it so now what's that talking about wherefore or therefore the law was our school Master to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith see there's no way to come to Christ outside of coming by the law because the law is the letter of the word amen you got to realize you're sinner right that's where people don't want to do that y I was born in this message I ain't never been out there like y'all well that's good but what is a school Master now when I went to school we had a school teacher Y and we had some of them the good ones yeah and you didn't play Belly AES and all of these things you know cuz some of them old ma School teachers just seem like they didn't have no conscience whatsoever everybody agree amen yeah they seem like it was tough ready to beat you to death right but you know what when it's all over with you found out yes sir they done something for you right amen y they w't allow the teachers today to do what those done they w't allow them to pick you up and wear you out and you know you see that's Mama y well the prophet said I don't believe in child delinquency I believe in parent delinquency that's it that's it amen they sent home word to us that our children had been corrected we took some steps yep well they feeding on my poor little old kid y I said what's the problem what' you do well Daddy I didn't do anything they accused me I didn't do it you're lying now you're lying to me now you're going to get a double whooping that's right right that's right but what you mean yeah but it turned out pretty good amen a school Master now let me take the side of the prophets that's talking about adoption and let me try to bring out a point on it see in adoption we think that Christ comes and lives in us and lives and that's great we believe that well if that tutor he's a razor or a school Master that's the Holy Spirit right amen but what if the Holy Spirit didn't have no rules and regulations to teach you right you agree do you get what I mean now you follow me I'm talking about how trying to make the importance of the law which you think I'm against the law see people hearing me no I've never tried to do away with the law because it's my school Master right if I could find all of those men I know they're most dead but I thank everyone that ever helped me during my Christian experience I than every Pastor that ever had you know we had a lot of them at l i mean at gil and some of them the last three months you know but you know what I appreciate every one of them you know what I stood on their side I was a deacon I Stood Beside of him if there was any argument went on I was beside the pastor and I told him I said as long as you're right I'll be here if you're wrong I won't be here I thank God for a school master that could teach me how to read and write in the natural I thank God that he'd give me a tutor to raise me and he can be called your school master but then he gave me the law that that tutor would have something to teach me now I thought we understood from adoption that the tutor was to teach the nature of the father is that true now are we with the message now the the tutor in adoption is to teach you the nature of the father well you want to know the nature of my father you you got a a while to read yeah here he is this Bible is the nature of my father from Genesis to Revelations amen it tells me about my father's nature amen it shows me that even when I do do wrong that he don't throw me out of the family amen may have to whip me may have to correct me amen but right hear is his nature right in the Bible the word of God I'm holding it up so then it is my school Master become a wonderful point now of thinking about the Lord law but the law was what held me kept me but then it directed me to God what about a school master that we might be justified by faith the only way to come to Jesus Christ to come by his word and when you hear it you're hearing the natural letter of the word because you're not born again you're hearing the natural letter of the word and the only way you can get born again is hear the natural letter of the word well I just out by myself and the Lord just fell down and saved me well you heard it somewhere right right are you read it or whatever right cuz my Bible says what faith cometh by what hear hearing and hearing by the word of God right right that's what's my school master I honor it I cherish it because it brought me to Christ it brought me to an understanding of God what about you did this message bring you to a better understanding of God or did it just so set you free until you can just live like the devil and still claim to be in the message so it was our school Master to bring us unto Christ so without it we would never be able to come to Christ without the law the letter of God's word you can never be saved right that's right so it sound like I'm not throwing off on it now huh so when I say the law is the letter that's what brought us to Christ but when I say like I did Wednesday and and this morning trying to drive it hard that we took the law they took the law and tried to make it some Grace cuz they chose law instead of Grace really they chose law thinking that was the word of God you know the way of God you know if we we we pray if we do this we do that we we can we can really get you know we can just appease Our Father you know you wouldn't talking a bunch of about a bunch of uh what do you call them idiots you were talking about people that knew the law the letter of it that's why I love to read Paul cuz I see in Paul myself I don't mean to claim that to be anything worth anything but I see myself in what he says I read it and I see myself and I realize that there was no Wretched Man standing here and who can free me from this body of death come on brother but look now wherefore the law is our school Master to bring us into Christ that we might be justified by faith but after faith has come we're no longer under the school Master for all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus so we just throw out the word right rip it up throw it out cuz we're no longer under Master now it's what I think the Bible says that they come to a point there one time that everybody done what they thought was right in their own eyes right that's right lady was telling her husband one day going down the road I heard this story and brother Randon was telling something on the tape and she said listen to the that he grabbed a tap throw it in the back it ain't no man going to tell me course he's a follower of this message but listen then we're all the children of God we all have to have a school Master bless God the holy spirit is my school master or do you think he's going contrary to the father's word all right solved the problem didn't it but think about it look what Paul had to say in Romans 7 right down below where we've been stopping on our reading Romans 7:14 says for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin I told you and you you not you don't believe it probably but you enough of you had enough rounds for me to tell you a thing or two and then you go out and find it out it's true you already to listen the Baptist teach that Paul wasn't born again there he got born again in Romans 8:1 he was explaining his life as getting saved go to Romans 1 and find out who it's written to Paul is not explaining that he needs to be born again we know the law is spiritual but I'm carnal I'm still sold under sin no he didn't say he was a sinner he didn't say he's going out every day and sinning no he said I'm just under this condition that I'm living in of Life watch him now the things that he goes through and he for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I sound like he's pretty honest man sound like he's just telling about his life don't it after he's born again then if I do that which I would not if I go out and do something wrong I consent or agree y that the law is good go it condemn me I agree with the word telling me I'm a sinner don't you now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me Paul are you admitting you're a sinner I think he's saying what brother random says he said we sin every day right right and say as long as we're in this flesh we will be a sticker right right see there's no more ey that do it now the eye that do it is no more eye than that one can't do it and it don't do it it's not I it's not the inward part of me that's doing it right it's not the soul of me that's doing it right it is my flesh motivated by my spirit remember the flesh is worth nothing without Spirit listen for I know that in me that is in my flesh now you know what he's talking about right dwelleth no good thing simple for to will is present with me other words I want to do it I want to be right but how to perform that which is good I find not can't you see the struggle in your life every day and the problems of life and the troubles and the heartaches amen you get flustrated with the kids and you would grab one of them up and spank it you you get flustrated C somebody run you off the road you you you know somebody chew you out at the grocery store because you stepped in a line or something and the human part of you don't stand there and say I'm going to I'm sweet no there's something inside of me has to say hey boy you don't supposed to act like that right not outside of me cuz outside of me wants to act like that you're just not honest the biggest problem I didn't hit anybody in the nose you know because of problems or whatever I step back give them the way do whatever but that little thing inside of me is the one that's taken care of it not me right now for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do he's not talking about sinning as a sinner dranking too much or running around with women or you know gambling or something he's not talking about junk he's talking about normal things if you want me I'll find where brother brandham says it about this very scripture I could probably look in my Bible and give it to you where brother bman is explaining that on conduct order and Doctrine and he says mainly what he's talking about is like he said I promised him I'd be at church tonight he said but when I come in I was just worh SL out see the things that I would I don't he's not talking about living as a devil and sin he said but I promised I'd be down here to service that's what he's explaining Paul talking about Paul gets a little upset with Peter one time don't he he said Peter why are you acting like that you trying to teach them Gentiles out there to act this way and you hear you acting this way he might have raised his voice at him he wouldn't take who was it John Mark which one was it that one one of the two that Paul wouldn't take with him Mark but later on he said tell him come on you know I kind of got over my part and he's got over his by now tell him come on see we think that being a Christian is walking nothing don't bother me well I wish it was out way but I the only problem is I'd have trouble following it I just try to be what I am you know by doing that I can say I'm sorry you know but if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me and Paul are you just a rank Center no no this outside man of me is still got problems right troubles and heartaches it's not that we just live like the devil and claimed to be a Christian that's not supposed to be I find in a law that's not just Ten Commandments right right right I find in a law I find a balance or a position or something that when I would do good Evil's present with me right I've always told you and it ain't no joke about it but I always told you you could go give away people a million dollars to people and you know in another day or two they' be run I got to go pay taxes on this now man back when we used to make $2,000 a year you know and that was that's all we made and I remember richer people you know they' GP about all the taxes they had to pay I paid more taxes than you drawed the whole year I said I'd like to do that yeah cuz that would mean I had to make at least 20,000 you know and here I am making two come on right I find a law that when I would do good evil is press for I Delight in the law of God what the law of God is that the Ten Commandments dos and don'ts and regulations he's not saying that about that is he he said I Delight in the law of God after the inward man not the outward he just got too sad he's having troubles but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members well not Paul it sound like you're just a sinner he'd say Amen I'm a sinner saved by grace all right in my body I'm going to get to this in a second we're human and we're mortal and we're you know we're carnal all right no because that's what we are and we're subject to this world no matter how much you're a Christian and what you are you're subject to this world you got to eat you got to sleep you got to work you got to pay taxes right yes sir come on the law of sin which is in my m members not after the inward man he just got through saying that he delighted after the law of the inward man so what of members is he talking about the body and the spirit okay look what he says about it oh Wretched Man that I am after he's born again crying out out and says who shall deliver me from the body of this death now John on patmas saw a man lost he was crying out for a redeemer right you agree right he wanted a redeemer to come a lamb to come now may I say something oh Wretched Man that I am will it ever come to a time that this body that I'm living in that will go by the grave cuz he knew his Rapture wasn't coming brother R said Paul was trying to get it out of their mind that the Rapture was coming right then said is there a possibility that somebody will reach a place in faith that will be able to draw me out of the Grave cuz you see if they're not brought out of the Grave they are still under death right oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death he knew he was having a lot of troubles in the natural and wanted to be delivered right right then but don't you think he's pointing down to a time that he really wanted to be totally delivered a resurrection would come I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord oh Wretched Man that I am is it a possibility that anybody could ever reach a place to draw me from the grave I thank God through Jesus Christ it will come in the end time so what are you going to do Paul what are you going to do Paul so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God that's not the brain that's the mind and of Christ being in you make you a new creature that's not the soul that's soul that's not brain all right so then with a mind until something takes place to remove me from this condition I'm in I will with my mind my the inward man I will serve God but with the flesh the law of sin not to be a sinner that he had to sin I'll just be part of this I'll just be part of this until it comes takes place see then what are we we say but brother Dale after the New Birth we're not under the law I don't understand what you're talking about we are under the law of the human body and spirit we're only free in the Soul by the new birth this flesh is holding me Romans 7:25 there says I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin not that he had to sin as some say I can't help it Jesus said we could and he proved it right but Paul was saying I'm in a carnal atmosphere subject to this carnal things of carnality you know life it would be great if we Christians were living in a cubicle what about those people down through there that had to give their life for the gospel Paul said I have the mind of Christ that's the new birth but I need something to help me with this Old Law of the sin of death as long as we're in this flesh we're going to be controlled to a degree by the flesh number four we'll try to hurry Corinthians 1 Corinthians 7: 32-34 but I would have you with uh uh would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried carried for the things that belong to the Lord out that he may please the Lord but he that is married cared for the things that are of the world he may please his wife all right there is difference between a wife and a vir virgin the unmarried woman virgin aren't she cares for the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married cares for the things of the world now she may please her husband just showing you the point that no matter how much we think we're not in this world we're still in this world and there's nothing wrong with it in the right order I love to eat yeah most everybody in here goes along with that there's a couple of skinny ones Joyce and Julie sister Monica she's holding on we'll get her out of if you stay around here a while right do you understand understand the point Paul is illustrating what I'm using it for as long as we're in this life we're bound to this life we got to work for a living got to pay taxes we got to send our kids to school or homeschool thems or whatever we do we got certain rules and regulation certain laws that we must abide by well there's anything wrong with that no it's a good life but the flesh will always let lean to the works of the law or the letter and then we'll look at what each other does do you see that girl had that dress on now I'm a human being and I hope you understand adult talking but but when you keep emphasizing so much about what somebody wires you know you might turn that into lust right okay but you see that's what we do because newborn babies are newly born babies you know they look at the DS and the don'ts and the things you said you calling us newborn babies well that's better than calling you Sinners okay better than saying you're lost that's but you start out looking at what people do and what they don't do and even shake my hand there something wrong maybe he's mad at me right they didn't even speak to me what did you speak to them no I wanted them speak first good kid we laughed yesterday coming back from down the road with Abby and Richard they both got into that Taurus thing arguing with each other about over a little old ball and I ain't letting you have it let me have that ball they just fussing like crazy but Abby finally give in said here Daddy you can have it but listen Israel wanted something to do I'm not getting along too good go to number five let's get a couple of quotes and then we'll try to just sum it up number five is the mark of the beast preached in 1956 75 dear God just as a poet wrote there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's Vine we realize that the kingdom of God is not what what we eat or drink or wearing of a pearl we realize that God we don't stop this and stop wearing this and that to make us different we don't stop this and stop that to make us different right but when the spirit of Christ comes in it does that itself right it's not what we do but what he does what he does all right look at the next one taking from the message mzc great Prince and King 5510 109 morning service and the Covenant was given to Abraham unconditionally not Abraham if you'll do something I'll do this but have already done it see it isn't what we do it's what he has done for us nothing we could do to Merit anything who could we the unrighteous ones ever do anything to Merit something before the great Jehovah God and his great Supreme Holiness watch now we only thing we can do is accept and be grateful ful for what he has already done for us oh that's so simple isn't it and I'm positive that many times in people's thinking that we try to make Divine Healing and so forth some great Outreach something way away if I could only reach it you see what he saying if I could do something and do it it but it won't work Paul Romans 8:7 says because the carnal mind is at enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God and neither indeed can be but to be carnally minded he says is death to be spiritually minded is life Paul in 1 Corinthians 9:27 he said but I keep under my body in other words I keep my body under this is the way it's stating it but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection that's the whole goal of the Christian attitude right one last point the law is the letter of the Bible and what we need is the new birth to interpret that we'll get to that next week or else we'll be like all before us even the Pharisees who said to Jesus John 9:28 about the blind man they said to the blind man you're one of his disciples but we are Moses disciples we do what Moses said people today say we hunted and fish with the prophet they can tell you everything he said but Paul said in Acts 19 and2 have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed in other words you got to First believe the letter of the word the law if you want to make me to use the word the letter of God's word you must receive that from first then the Holy Spirit can come and Quicken what you've held is that the promise that Jesus told him said I bring to you remembrance whatsoever I've said and teach you things to come he said Not only did he bring to what remembrance was that even taught him further on the Revelation then to start the thought that we must be born again and that will start the thought of being born again will start the point of thinking that we can come to a place to be totally dead and Paul sums it up and says not in the oldness of the letter what about it do we think we've been something that there a reason God saved us you think we're in this message because we're smart we've intelligent we've learned no you say is there any hopes brother Dale have ever overcome in this flesh when a change comes it will take care of that but we don't have to yield to the flesh now I hope you understand what I got through I went through all of it with that a man had to be concerned about his wife and to be this that the other the Bible says not even to fast unless it be with consent but the Devil tempt you for your inconsistency we're being set free death is slowly being annihilated even though we're getting older right right because the more the word is revealed the more death is being destroyed that's right there is no death in the new birth but it takes a death to get it that's right there is no one alive now listen to what say there's no one alive that's got the new birth did you understand that one if you're dead you can have the new birth you can't have the new birth while you're alive right so then we're to die out to ourselves and be born again being set free come on musicians being set free a process it starts by the new birth and will continue until the change of the body I believe then we can say we're free but what about those early cre Christians so much in Christ until they offered them in those Arenas and things they offered them to be set free if they just recant from their belief in Jesus Christ they wouldn't do it they walked into death and was so Gallant in doing it until it's recorded that even sometimes the soldiers that was leading them are driving them into the arena would just throw down their weapons and walk in with them they saw something that was real I like that song He's still working on me what we got brother let's stand number 9 too sad is fire that longing in your the whole anybody have a need find true satisfaction going to be going to see a friend that's dying with cancer out in Colorado so let's just send a prayer CLA let's believe that when she gets there it'll all be taken care of do you believe it see that's looking P death science says you got cancer you're dying but the Bible says he that is alive so let's believe it father we send this pray Clause believing it and when our sister gets there things will already be amending and all be well we love you we thank you Father in Jesus name anybody else I am who can free me from this body of sin an end time people that will become the word of God and walk up to death and just walk straight through it because he said it you know it's not going to be them it's going to be him fulfilling his word we're not something special in the end time we're no different than any other age we're just the people that he chose to be here to believe maybe it is a special point that we can believe but we're just human beings like everybody else he's G us the ability to believe look death right in the eye and life at it what about oh you heard our brother Lord just be there with him wind take care of everything but let him die out to himself and just be what you need him to be we love you father in Jesus name just believe it thank his word anybody else heard our little buddy he's concerned about somebody there father you just reach down and touch make everything be all right because our little buddy ask you he believes you in Jesus name amen anybody else your soul and only than you make you

thank you that we could have the spirit of the Living God within us that we could read your word that when mankind has read it for 2,000 years sometimes on people and they still hadn't found out what to talk about Lord with little group of people in the end time that could get out of their way of themselves and they just depend upon you and let you speak to our hearts and lives Paul could cry out and see this end time and know that there would be a change come to somebody and that he'd be raised before that takes place we love you father have your way just be with everybody on the way home take care of them be with the sick among us guide each one in Jesus name amen you dismissed all
