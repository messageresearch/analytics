[14:43] then we'll go to hosea then back to
[14:45] isaiah 59
[14:47] all right
[14:50] for thus verse 15 for thus saith the
[14:52] high and lofty
[14:54] one that inhabited eternity whose name
[14:57] is holy
[14:58] i dwell in the high and holy place with
[15:01] him
[15:02] also that is of a contrite now listen
[15:05] look where god dwells we think he dwells
[15:08] up in heaven
[15:10] now look where he says he dwells
[15:12] right
[15:14] said his name was holy i dwell in the
[15:16] high and holy place
[15:18] with him also that is of a contrite and
[15:21] humble spirit to revive the spirit of
[15:24] the humble and to revive the heart of
[15:25] the contrite ones
[15:27] for i will not contend forever
[15:30] neither will i be
[15:32] always wrought
[15:34] for the spirit should fail before me and
[15:37] the souls which i have
[15:39] made all right now let's go over to
[15:42] hosea
[15:46] and we'll go to chapter 6
[15:49] verse 1 and 2.
[15:51] come and let us return unto the lord for
[15:53] he hath torn and he will heal us he has
[15:56] smitten and he will bind us up
[15:59] after two days will he revive us
[16:02] in the third day he will raise us up and
[16:04] we shall live in his sight let's go on
[16:08] to the next you might not have it
[16:09] affirmative but he shall know and follow
[16:11] on to know the lord is going forth his
[16:13] preparedness the mourning and he shall
[16:15] come forth unto us as to rain
[16:17] as the latter and former reign unto the
[16:20] earth now we're back in isaiah
[16:25] 59
[16:27] and we'll read verse 19 and 20.
[16:31] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[16:33] from the west and
[16:35] his glory from the rising of the sun
[16:37] when the enemy shall come in like a
[16:39] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[16:42] up a standard against him
[16:44] and the redeemer shall come to zion now
[16:47] if you're reading over in in romans it
[16:50] says out of zion all right which is the
[16:52] bride
[16:53] and and the redeemer shall come to zion
[16:56] and unto them that turn from
[16:58] transgression in jacob saith the lord
[17:00] you may be seated the lord had his
[17:02] blessing to the reading of the word um
[17:05] brother aaron you might need to
[17:08] at least click us a fan it's hard to do
[17:10] in this time of the year we're up and
[17:12] down and
[17:14] air conditioning parts don't work
[17:16] and i've told them to put back on one of
[17:18] those
[17:19] thermostat things where i can come out
[17:21] and operate it because i'm just sorry i
[17:23] don't have the
[17:24] ability to figure out all this
[17:27] new fang dangle stuff
[17:29] you know but come over there and at
[17:32] least put some fan running
[17:34] now
[17:38] i want to talk about something this
[17:39] morning that i believe is a very
[17:41] important matter
[17:42] for us to understand
[17:45] but if we
[17:46] don't uh
[17:48] get the entire story
[17:52] uh i believe we will miss
[17:55] the truth of it of course i believe it's
[17:56] that way throughout the scripture all of
[17:58] the word is that way it's not just one
[18:00] scripture or one thought or one doing
[18:04] it's connected with
[18:05] all things that it must be put together
[18:08] because you can take anything you want
[18:10] to a quote a thought
[18:13] and you can have your own idea and
[18:16] that's basically what people do
[18:19] and i was thinking you know
[18:22] there the other day then while i was
[18:24] hunting
[18:25] uh
[18:26] and i wrote i had these notes written at
[18:29] home as kind of a lineup
[18:32] and i had to tire them up and change it
[18:34] over because
[18:35] i was sitting on a deer stand and
[18:37] you know and the lineup came as to kind
[18:39] of how to bring it apart
[18:41] and i got looking for something to write
[18:43] on
[18:44] i couldn't find no paper and all of my
[18:47] stuff i carry with me i couldn't find
[18:49] nothing you know brother random that
[18:50] wrote on gun stocks and and wrote on a
[18:53] rifle boxes cartridge boxes
[18:56] and all
[18:57] i wound up writing
[18:59] notes
[19:00] on flagging tape
[19:03] you know
[19:07] didn't see many deer but i got a whole
[19:10] line of flagging tape
[19:11] and brought it home because i knew if i
[19:13] didn't i would forget maybe the lineup
[19:16] that was coming to me as to how to
[19:18] present what i was talking about
[19:21] i want to talk about a revival
[19:24] and i know immediately
[19:26] there it goes
[19:29] internets of course to you on the
[19:30] internet hi how you doing somewhere at
[19:32] home today but ray said he'd be watching
[19:34] us
[19:35] but
[19:36] you know to all of you here
[19:39] automatically you have already by now
[19:42] considered your thought
[19:44] even just two minutes or one minute of
[19:46] talking
[19:47] as to announcement of what i was saying
[19:50] you have already crystallized your
[19:52] thoughts
[19:54] upon what
[19:55] you believe
[19:57] and and uh i was thinking about the fact
[20:00] of waiting them going to the minister's
[20:03] meeting and
[20:04] uh you know i wonder if you asked a
[20:07] question how many people came to the
[20:09] meeting
[20:11] praying
[20:13] for god to speak to their heart
[20:16] i'd say 99.9
[20:20] maybe a little more but
[20:22] came with intentions
[20:25] of speaking what they
[20:28] believed
[20:30] all right and they did
[20:32] they do
[20:33] but
[20:34] see instead of praying even for the
[20:36] speaker you come already set to what
[20:38] you're doing all right brother brown
[20:40] said people won't listen to what you're
[20:42] saying they're listening to refute what
[20:45] you're saying well you've already
[20:47] immediately mean me mentioning that i
[20:49] want to speak on a revival
[20:51] you've already set your mind
[20:54] to a point that
[20:56] uh instead of saying well now let me
[20:59] pray
[21:00] for this to where that maybe it will
[21:02] bring out something to open my eyes
[21:05] you've automatically done set to where
[21:08] you'd like to take over the service and
[21:10] explain what you believe
[21:14] yeah okay
[21:18] might be a surprise you know
[21:20] to listen
[21:22] and that's what i say if you cut your
[21:23] mind off see
[21:24] you'll never listen
[21:27] you won't pay any attention to what's
[21:28] being said you're only wanting to refute
[21:32] that
[21:33] and you're so religiously superior to
[21:36] you want to get up and
[21:38] explain it
[21:39] because you got it right
[21:41] well
[21:43] you remember one day we would have got
[21:45] up and run to the altar and tried to
[21:47] explain a trinity
[21:50] right
[21:52] because that's what we believed
[21:55] but then after a while maybe now we
[21:57] wouldn't run up so quick you know
[21:59] so then listening is my point
[22:02] forgive me for that blunt statements but
[22:05] i
[22:06] i know the human mind and how we do
[22:10] and things like that
[22:11] but i want to talk about a revival and
[22:13] before we even get into anything
[22:16] i want to remind you that if you'd look
[22:19] in the message
[22:20] and run in the word revival
[22:23] i really didn't look to see how many
[22:25] notes there were quotes they were
[22:28] but there's many things spoken about a
[22:30] revival
[22:32] a revive or whatever
[22:35] all right
[22:36] and see you can have a revival just in
[22:38] one service
[22:39] and brother brandon will speak of just
[22:42] a little short series of meetings this
[22:43] little revival we've had down here
[22:45] at uh you know maybe some statement or
[22:49] some place
[22:50] all right
[22:52] and he then he'd take it as
[22:54] a great sweeping thing
[22:57] then he would speak of it in many other
[22:59] ways
[23:00] and see we can say well you know which
[23:03] one's right well let's see if we can
[23:06] discuss that to the point or think about
[23:08] it
[23:09] as to what would do
[23:11] and i know even the scripture that i
[23:13] read it said after two days
[23:17] in the third day
[23:19] well
[23:21] okay now
[23:22] we should have known
[23:24] because we were looking for 2 000 years
[23:27] to end the thing up which would have
[23:29] been two days
[23:30] well we're already in the third day
[23:32] right
[23:33] because you've done past over your 2000
[23:35] years so you're in the third day so the
[23:38] bible's right
[23:40] it's just our thoughts
[23:43] back in the 60s 70s 80s or something we
[23:46] would have swore that it would have
[23:47] never passed the year
[23:49] because that's two two days you know and
[23:52] we couldn't do that you know
[23:54] but
[23:56] we'll try to get into the point
[23:59] now a revival signifies
[24:03] a move of god
[24:06] in power i'll read that in just a second
[24:09] of what it
[24:11] uh you know is doing
[24:12] and uh
[24:14] but now let's read
[24:16] 1a i've got that so i told them which
[24:18] way to go
[24:19] the message expectations
[24:21] and uh
[24:23] think about what the prophet has to say
[24:25] and if we for slow reading today i
[24:27] intend to read slow even if it takes
[24:29] both services
[24:31] to bring this out
[24:33] look what he says
[24:35] a minister cannot bring a revival
[24:38] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[24:42] okay
[24:44] he doesn't pack it with him
[24:47] the only thing he can do
[24:50] is just be loyal to god in his word and
[24:53] the revival has to come
[24:55] by the people
[24:58] right
[24:58] in your home in your life
[25:02] now revival isn't adding new members to
[25:04] the church
[25:06] it's reviving that what we've already
[25:08] got to revive means to bring back all
[25:11] right now we've no that in the baptist
[25:13] church when we'd say we're going to have
[25:15] a revival and
[25:17] revival is not to sinners you can't
[25:19] revive a sinner you got to get him saved
[25:22] before you can revive him so we knew
[25:24] that but the revival would be then the
[25:27] after effects of getting the people
[25:29] straight
[25:30] that were already in the church would
[25:33] bring forth salvation to a lot of people
[25:35] because you know it would bring a move
[25:38] in things so just remember now
[25:41] a revival signifies a move of god
[25:45] in power
[25:47] all right
[25:48] now
[25:49] so let's go and read but don't forget
[25:52] now as i said you go on and read and you
[25:55] say i've got this quote
[25:57] well all right i'll try my best to read
[25:59] it if not you
[26:01] let me know later and i'll be glad to
[26:03] read it
[26:04] because i want to be right
[26:06] but i want us to think about something
[26:11] is it possible
[26:14] to have a revival
[26:18] and nobody know it but you
[26:26] is it possible for there to be a revival
[26:29] for
[26:30] the bride only
[26:34] that would not have any relationship to
[26:36] the world
[26:38] all right
[26:41] and see in those things then we can find
[26:43] our answer
[26:45] to the quotes that he brings and like i
[26:47] said you read it you say well i've
[26:49] looked it up
[26:50] he said it 300 times revival well that's
[26:53] good and a lot of that was speaking of
[26:55] just our series of services
[26:59] a little revival he said we've had here
[27:00] at the tabernacle
[27:02] you know
[27:03] but you know it still meant when he's
[27:05] using the word revival it means the same
[27:08] thing
[27:09] a reviving of
[27:11] those that are already
[27:13] born again
[27:15] all right
[27:16] and it means a move of god in power
[27:20] all right
[27:22] now would you think in this day that
[27:24] there would be anything that could be
[27:25] related to a revival
[27:29] in our day
[27:31] you know
[27:33] what would you think
[27:35] well brother dale i got it 1956
[27:37] revival's over
[27:40] well i got one in 63
[27:42] that it ain't started yet
[27:45] so now which one do you want
[27:49] all right
[27:51] you see that's where we think we know
[27:52] all about it we get our mindset
[27:54] when maybe we ought to listen to the
[27:56] person
[27:58] brother molten
[27:59] myself years ago we used to check out a
[28:01] lot you know about people out in the
[28:05] message things and they'd be saying that
[28:06] brother's wrong that brother's wrong
[28:08] well you know that was the ones we went
[28:09] and listened to
[28:11] because if everybody was against them we
[28:13] figured they might have at least a
[28:14] little bit so you know so we'd run and
[28:17] listen to it
[28:18] all right but now look what he says
[28:23] see no one person can bring a revival he
[28:25] said well that's contrary to quote so
[28:27] and so because that revival of the azusa
[28:31] street was credited to start with one
[28:33] man that's right
[28:34] revivals were started in
[28:36] in uh
[28:38] swiney knox or one of one of them by a
[28:40] lady cleaning the
[28:42] pew all right and praying for the people
[28:46] and all like that but just remember
[28:48] that one person can't do it
[28:51] it would have to move out into others
[28:54] before it would have any effect
[28:57] all right so now go to number one and
[28:59] let's look and just read and see what
[29:01] your prophet had to say
[29:05] this is taken from the
[29:07] page 70 of the
[29:09] ephesian church age which is a church
[29:10] age book i want to carry this thought
[29:13] all the way through
[29:15] so let us go a step further
[29:17] have you ever studied the history of
[29:19] revivals
[29:21] now revival signifies a move of god in
[29:23] power
[29:24] and every time god moves
[29:27] satan is there to move also
[29:29] it never fails
[29:31] in the days of the great welts revival
[29:33] and most people don't know this the
[29:35] insane asylums filled up quickly and
[29:37] there was a great display of devil power
[29:39] to take away the attention from god
[29:43] it is written that in wesley's day the
[29:45] people would do most peculiar things
[29:47] that were definitely of satan to try to
[29:51] mark the goodness and power of god
[29:55] in luther's day it has said that the
[29:56] miracle of his ministry did not lie in
[29:59] the fact that he successfully protested
[30:02] the roman catholic church but the
[30:04] miracle lay in the fact that he could
[30:06] and did stay sound
[30:08] and sane amidst the fanatics
[30:10] who were often filled with and guided by
[30:13] wrong spirits
[30:14] and if you have been aware of this last
[30:16] day ministry you will have noted the
[30:19] same invasion of faults and wicked
[30:21] spirits
[30:22] it has to be that way now i hope and
[30:25] trust
[30:26] you are spiritually spiritual minded
[30:29] enough to get that and capitalize on it
[30:32] all right
[30:34] see we make our thoughts of a revival
[30:37] is to be
[30:39] that oh everybody would see it
[30:43] and there's been some revivals we'll
[30:45] cover that
[30:48] but if you couldn't read that right
[30:50] there and think
[30:51] that this age is the most or where we're
[30:53] at right now
[30:55] is the most definite signs
[30:57] that a revival is going on
[31:01] i think you're blind
[31:04] don't mean eyesight 2020s
[31:06] i think you're spiritually blind
[31:09] to just read that
[31:15] because
[31:18] what is a revival
[31:21] it's a power move of god and power
[31:24] all right
[31:25] and
[31:26] then to prove that god is here doing it
[31:30] every age had the insane asylums filled
[31:33] up
[31:34] well if you're not very familiar with
[31:37] what's going on today
[31:39] i would think that if i was you brother
[31:42] branham called it not insanity in the
[31:44] assigned asylum he said it's on the very
[31:47] streets
[31:51] so if there's any sign that you want to
[31:53] place anything on
[31:56] i believe you're to place this thing on
[31:58] the bases and step you're in your mind
[32:00] that says this is the greatest revival
[32:03] that has ever been
[32:05] because
[32:07] it's the greatest
[32:10] signs and doings of satan that has ever
[32:13] been amen
[32:14] right
[32:16] all right
[32:17] see then that order settled that part
[32:18] without even a thoughts of anything else
[32:23] because number one what god moves
[32:27] satan moves
[32:30] right
[32:32] all right so in the days of luther god
[32:35] moved
[32:36] satan moved there's a wesley pentecostal
[32:40] in this ministry of the last days
[32:43] all right
[32:44] well
[32:45] see then i think that we're in the
[32:47] greatest signs of
[32:49] a revival
[32:50] that could ever ever be
[32:54] because of the way satan's doing
[32:58] right
[33:00] he's on every way he's doing everything
[33:03] he can to fight truth
[33:06] look at the people of the message how
[33:07] they're going
[33:10] look at the things that are transpiring
[33:12] among the
[33:13] what we call believers
[33:17] the devil's gone on vacation
[33:21] he's he's gone taking a rest somewhere
[33:23] because he's not needed to fight the
[33:26] people because he's got all the
[33:27] preachers
[33:28] and remember the bible says he has
[33:31] ministers
[33:33] and the bible says they are ministers of
[33:36] righteousness
[33:38] they're not legalistic law teachers
[33:42] a preacher of righteousness is one who
[33:44] tries to preach righteousness as a form
[33:47] of being right
[33:50] is that the quote
[33:52] well see then think about it
[33:56] think about that point
[33:58] and consider it
[34:00] consider the fact that
[34:02] if satan is so
[34:04] prevalent today
[34:06] and the maniacs the craziness of the
[34:09] streets and the people and the way
[34:11] they're doing
[34:12] you know
[34:15] till they just go out and just just kill
[34:17] a bunch of people
[34:18] you know they don't care
[34:21] and it's insanity
[34:23] right down the highway they're going to
[34:24] run you off the road
[34:26] how much do we need to think about how
[34:28] insane
[34:29] this
[34:30] generation has gone
[34:33] well now according to the bible that i
[34:35] just read it
[34:40] no we're supposed to believe the bible
[34:42] according to where we just read in
[34:44] isaiah 59 it says when the enemy comes
[34:46] in like a flood
[34:49] what did it say god would do
[34:53] so we see the enemy
[34:55] but i don't know where god's at he's
[34:58] just not here all right you're with that
[35:00] man it was down in the ages it said
[35:02] how could god fold his arms you know and
[35:05] remember him
[35:06] i think it was joe lewis what it was the
[35:08] name
[35:09] not the boxer it was another
[35:12] and he said
[35:13] where was
[35:14] god well is that what it is today here
[35:17] in lula georgia is it where is god
[35:20] that's why wednesday night i had you to
[35:22] testify
[35:24] and i hope it was on the internet for
[35:25] people to do and i asked a question i
[35:27] said how many people's been healed in
[35:29] this 40 something 41 this is 42 i think
[35:32] sermon
[35:33] of this series and they would i think i
[35:36] call 15 hands that went up
[35:40] all right
[35:42] but yeah we don't see nothing going on
[35:46] well that's really a good answer right
[35:50] i should be able to just quit right now
[35:53] go sit down and say forget it
[35:58] and say we're in the greatest revival
[36:00] that has ever been.
[36:06] and you said i am because the proof has
[36:08] already been there but that won't do no
[36:10] good
[36:11] all right so we'll go through the best
[36:13] we can
[36:14] with other things to try to help you
[36:17] but remember come back to that
[36:19] all right
[36:21] now
[36:23] think about what
[36:25] is being said
[36:31] i asked some questions the other day to
[36:32] some about this
[36:34] and i mentioned it in one message
[36:39] if you believe
[36:41] that there's going to be
[36:43] now listen real carefully
[36:46] if you believe that there's going to be
[36:48] a worldwide sweeping revival
[36:52] in our day to the gentiles
[36:56] i believe you're wrong
[36:59] now did you follow me
[37:01] worldwide sweeping revival
[37:05] all right follow that line
[37:08] but now watch
[37:10] but if you're not looking and expecting
[37:12] a revival in our day
[37:15] you are wrong and in a very bad delusion
[37:18] of satan
[37:22] then we're not looking or talking about
[37:24] a worldwide sweeping revival
[37:27] all right
[37:29] yeah
[37:31] what do you think about a revival
[37:35] and why do you think
[37:37] like you do
[37:43] what do you think about a revival
[37:45] i think revival's over well why do you
[37:47] think that
[37:51] well i got a quote well good then we've
[37:53] got other quotes now which quote do you
[37:55] want
[37:58] he said revival is over 56
[38:02] that was thus saith the lord
[38:05] we'll read it a minute
[38:08] but he said the bride ain't had a
[38:09] revival yet
[38:11] i guess that's not thus saith the lord
[38:18] so then we ought to consider what's
[38:20] being said amen
[38:22] instead of taking our own thoughts and
[38:24] locking it down and say
[38:27] i'd like to get up there right now and
[38:29] explain this
[38:31] no
[38:33] well
[38:35] i'll give you a chance when i finish
[38:40] all right
[38:43] now
[38:44] look the pentecostal people
[38:49] well
[38:50] he uses the word pentecostal
[38:54] even back in the baptists and things we
[38:56] talked about
[38:58] a great move of god coming
[39:01] you know a revival
[39:02] and things
[39:04] to come
[39:06] and how many people would be saved
[39:09] you know have you ever heard that one
[39:12] the denomination of believing a
[39:13] seven-year tribulation period basic i'm
[39:15] said basics now
[39:17] all right
[39:18] and uh
[39:20] in believing that they believe that's
[39:21] three and a half years of minor and
[39:23] three and a half years of major
[39:24] tribulation that's what it's called
[39:27] in the three and a half years of minor
[39:29] there's supposed to be a great sweeping
[39:31] revival
[39:32] that
[39:33] millions
[39:35] come to be saved
[39:40] now that's been talked about organized
[39:42] religion coming down
[39:43] he mentions pentecostals
[39:46] i did run it and there's relations to it
[39:48] but
[39:49] i couldn't find the the thing of doing
[39:51] it but i know that for myself of what we
[39:54] taught and what we believed because
[39:56] that's the reason of the seven year
[39:58] tribulation was three and a half years
[40:00] of minor and they would be people saved
[40:03] gentiles to be saved in that period of
[40:05] time
[40:06] and then it would come to a tribulation
[40:08] that you know would be to israel all
[40:10] right
[40:12] but now
[40:13] listen to what your prophet has to say
[40:14] go ahead with number two
[40:17] this is a message adopted in 1960
[40:20] 522 in the
[40:22] evening and he's coming down he talks
[40:25] about the the presbyterian talks about
[40:27] the you know how they believe that
[40:28] lutherans will come forth in the
[40:30] resurrection the baptist presbyterian
[40:32] the children will come forth in that
[40:34] resurrection
[40:35] that's the reason today people say
[40:37] all right now what
[40:39] people will say there are
[40:40] there'll be a sweeping revival
[40:42] that's what people say
[40:45] they'll go out here and save a hundred
[40:47] million
[40:48] pentecostals
[40:50] and all get saved and there'll be the
[40:52] rapture
[40:53] you're mistaken
[40:56] the rapture will be hundreds of
[40:58] thousands that's right
[41:00] but they'll be all made up in the six
[41:02] thousand years of salvation
[41:04] to six thousand years back
[41:07] all right
[41:08] look at the next one now
[41:11] this is abraham's covenant confirmed
[41:14] 1961
[41:17] 318
[41:20] he's talking about showing you know the
[41:21] things he said most of the people that i
[41:24] meet
[41:25] are looking for some great big wide
[41:27] world sweeping revival
[41:30] that's done past
[41:33] we're at the end
[41:37] you're looking for great miracles and
[41:39] signs
[41:41] because just because they don't know the
[41:43] bible
[41:45] that's the two prophets of revelation 11
[41:49] going to stop the son elijah and moses
[41:51] that's after the gentile church is gone
[41:54] see
[41:56] so they're looking and that's what
[41:58] brother branham explains to people that
[42:00] are looking for a great sweeping
[42:02] worldwide revival
[42:03] to be coming
[42:05] he said that's to
[42:07] israel with the two witnesses
[42:10] all right
[42:11] so then he was disproving the thoughts
[42:13] that people had that you know one day
[42:18] that there'd be a great tribulation set
[42:20] in
[42:22] and the best i could make out is a you
[42:25] know and trying to figure out what was
[42:26] being said they evidently believed in
[42:28] some people going up and then some
[42:30] people had to go through the tribulation
[42:32] but you know millions would be saved in
[42:34] the tribulation
[42:37] under a great world wide sweeping
[42:38] revival well there won't be any gentiles
[42:40] saved in the tribulation
[42:42] all right
[42:43] it's only to the jews
[42:45] all right that's only 144 000.
[42:49] and i know that he's covering that
[42:51] as a worldwide sweeping revival with
[42:53] great signs and wonders miracles and
[42:56] signs you know the sun stops the
[42:58] different things happens
[42:59] but remember
[43:01] there'll only be 144 thousand
[43:06] so there won't be no millions saved
[43:09] you only got 144 thousand all right
[43:12] now
[43:13] so then we're not looking at it as a
[43:15] worldwide sweeping revival
[43:20] all right
[43:21] so then that must be taken out of our
[43:23] minds
[43:24] as to the thought that
[43:26] you know
[43:28] that
[43:29] it would be
[43:30] this great thing to happen
[43:33] well there's not going to be any
[43:34] worldwide sweeping revival
[43:38] and i'll even make this statement where
[43:40] you'll think i'm correcting brother
[43:41] branham but you better listen
[43:43] even to the jews 144 000 it won't be a
[43:46] worldwide sweeping revival
[43:49] right it'll only be to the 144 000.
[43:52] so it won't be but the signs and the
[43:54] wonders is what people were looking for
[43:57] all right there'll come a time and he
[43:58] said not knowing the bible
[44:01] then they're looking for these great
[44:02] things to happen he said but that'll be
[44:05] to israel
[44:06] that should be settled in our minds
[44:09] all right
[44:11] now
[44:14] let's take some things and talk about it
[44:19] as i said if you're
[44:21] if you believe there's to be a worldwide
[44:22] sweeping revival to the gentiles
[44:25] i don't believe
[44:27] that
[44:29] i'm blunt i don't believe that
[44:32] i've explained that part there
[44:34] but if you're not looking expecting a
[44:36] revival in our day
[44:37] i believe you're wrong
[44:40] all right
[44:42] now i believe we can conclude and prove
[44:44] that
[44:45] and i wrote like this what do you think
[44:46] about a revival
[44:49] in our day
[44:52] and this is not something i've come up
[44:54] with and in the deer hunt the other day
[44:56] this has been my thoughts ever since i
[44:58] came into this message
[45:02] i've preached on it many times before
[45:04] down through time
[45:05] it's not a new doctrine or idea to come
[45:07] out because so and so said so and so
[45:09] this was my thoughts 40 some years ago
[45:13] all right
[45:15] and many of you know for sure that if
[45:16] i've said it over and over
[45:19] as you say brother dale are you looking
[45:20] for a revival in our day i'm exactly
[45:22] looking for a revival in our day
[45:27] but i explained it then i'm explaining
[45:29] it now not a worldwide sweeping revival
[45:34] no
[45:36] but to the bride of christ we'll give
[45:37] you one in a little bit or this evening
[45:39] we take time where brother brown said
[45:41] it's only for the elect
[45:44] all right
[45:45] so now somebody's going to click off go
[45:47] ahead and click all but remember i'm
[45:49] talking about a revival for the elect
[45:53] all right now
[45:55] but it must be placed in the correct
[45:57] order
[45:59] to understand
[46:02] all right
[46:04] now watch the i'll give you two quotes
[46:06] this way
[46:08] and two quotes this way
[46:11] all right
[46:12] and you make up your mind what you
[46:14] believe
[46:16] all right
[46:17] so let's go with number four
[46:20] which is christ revealed in his own word
[46:23] now this is 1965.
[46:27] if you'll notice
[46:30] 8 22 and
[46:32] 65.
[46:35] we take that now and compare it over
[46:37] with malachi 4.
[46:39] he promised that there would be light
[46:41] come again in the evening time
[46:43] all right now that the purpose of this
[46:45] is to just to get the point that we're
[46:47] depending upon
[46:49] the light to come in the evening time
[46:51] according to malachi 4. so go ahead and
[46:52] roll up
[46:54] you know what he's supposed to do and
[46:56] and notice this is at the end time that
[46:58] the son of man would be revealed roll it
[47:01] on up you can read all between to see if
[47:03] i missed it
[47:04] now
[47:06] there can't be
[47:07] so there can't be no organization left
[47:10] neither can there be any further
[47:12] advancement
[47:13] than what's going on right now
[47:17] now watch him
[47:19] you remember how we could spend a long
[47:20] time coming back to the grain coming
[47:22] back to the original and it would be the
[47:23] son of man do you remember the messages
[47:25] back
[47:26] months and months ago or
[47:28] look look what he says
[47:32] no be there be any
[47:35] neither can there
[47:37] be any further advancement than what's
[47:39] going on right now
[47:40] first you'll burn before the day breaks
[47:43] again
[47:44] the revival is over
[47:46] across the nation
[47:48] there ain't going to be no more revivals
[47:50] big sweeping revivals
[47:53] this nation
[47:55] never receive it
[47:57] you might have an intellectual gathering
[47:59] but i mean a spiritual revival
[48:02] we've seen all of it
[48:04] i hope you're catching it i'm saying it
[48:06] in such a way that i hope you get it
[48:09] you talk about the doing fine ministers
[48:11] a while ago said brother branham if i
[48:13] could just have the joy of the lord in
[48:16] my heart
[48:17] i said son the revival's over
[48:21] that's 1965.
[48:25] all right
[48:26] you say well he's saying it our
[48:28] revival's over
[48:31] well
[48:32] when we read that bride ain't had a
[48:34] revival yet now what are you going to do
[48:36] with that part
[48:37] you know
[48:39] but i want to read this one
[48:41] the word that you'll have it go to
[48:43] number five testimony on the c
[48:46] 62
[48:49] if god willing
[48:51] i'm giving you a try now of i'm giving a
[48:54] try now of evangelism
[48:57] we know the revival's over
[48:59] brother i think we got heat on instead
[49:01] of our
[49:03] we need some
[49:04] we need some of you saying that's
[49:05] comfortable
[49:06] joyce is saying oh it feels good
[49:09] but some are stopping up okay come and
[49:11] click it we're going to get this thing
[49:13] fixed where i can walk over there and go
[49:14] pow and that thing goes to working
[49:17] all right
[49:18] because that thing is
[49:20] beyond my mind
[49:22] all right
[49:24] now watch what he says
[49:26] he said i'm going to try now of
[49:27] evangelism
[49:29] we know the revival's over
[49:31] everyone knows that i predicted that
[49:33] back in 56 watch
[49:36] when it would start ending
[49:42] now there's a reason for that
[49:45] he predicted it when it would start
[49:46] ending what 1956
[49:49] because he said they'll turn down
[49:52] god this year
[49:54] i receive him and i predict they will
[49:56] turn him down all right watch now
[50:00] billy graham come back oral roberts or
[50:02] tommy osborne come and them said this is
[50:05] it america will receive it or reject it
[50:07] this year
[50:08] and they rejected it
[50:10] there's nothing waiting but judgment
[50:13] now he's talking about the united states
[50:14] right
[50:16] and you mark that down and see brother
[50:18] branham's right
[50:19] or not see if brother runs right around
[50:21] that's thus saith the lord
[50:23] we headed for it and we're going to pay
[50:26] for what we've done
[50:27] we got too much glamour in the church in
[50:30] hollywood and everything god's sick and
[50:32] tired of it the last one will come in
[50:35] after a while
[50:37] and that'll be it
[50:38] all right
[50:40] so he says
[50:42] the revival's over
[50:46] so your mind locks on that
[50:48] it's over
[50:50] all right
[50:52] now
[50:54] remember he said that
[50:56] in 62
[50:58] talking about
[51:00] uh 56
[51:04] you know
[51:05] so now let's read another one
[51:08] remember here's two revivals over
[51:11] now let's read from
[51:13] why christ speak 1959 1004 to
[51:17] evening
[51:19] speak and go forward that's right that's
[51:22] god's commission to his church
[51:24] we have no time to slack
[51:26] they say
[51:28] rev the revival's over
[51:30] it isn't over
[51:33] go forward
[51:35] it's time that pentecost watch him now
[51:38] it's time that pentecost is played out
[51:41] see that's what they're saying
[51:44] now remember he didn't say pentecostal
[51:46] that's what's so wonderful how the man
[51:48] in his statements
[51:50] in other words they say pentecost
[51:53] is played out it isn't
[51:56] until the life member of the body of
[51:58] christ comes in and then we leave out of
[52:00] here and even after that the two
[52:02] witnesses pentecost is still going
[52:05] right right but we don't read that away
[52:07] we just read what we want we read that
[52:09] pentecostal
[52:11] he didn't say pentecost
[52:12] he said pentecost
[52:14] look
[52:16] it it's time for pentecost
[52:19] to rise in the name of jesus christ and
[52:22] go forward
[52:24] there's no retreat there's no staying on
[52:27] the same ground let's move the spirit or
[52:30] the spirit will move on to somebody else
[52:33] and leave you standing you follow it do
[52:36] all this in your heart for god is with
[52:38] you
[52:39] all right
[52:40] so that one says
[52:43] we haven't had it yet
[52:47] it's not over
[52:49] something's going on
[52:52] 59 let's move
[52:57] but 56 he said it's over well
[53:00] it is to the world
[53:03] there'll never be another worldwide
[53:05] sweeping revival to the gentiles
[53:08] that's right right so it's over
[53:12] but does that mean it's over for you and
[53:14] i
[53:15] well let's
[53:17] wait on brother brown come back and
[53:19] maybe he can tell us something well i
[53:21] praise god and hope he hurry it up
[53:24] i'm not against any of that i've told
[53:26] you where i stand
[53:29] we've got a 30 40 days we can have a lot
[53:31] of understanding open
[53:33] but look what he says
[53:35] go on to the next one this is your e
[53:37] hymn
[53:40] preacher 1960.
[53:43] placing of a son
[53:45] take him out in a certain place have a
[53:47] ceremony before angels and place him
[53:50] positionally what he is in the body of
[53:51] christ
[53:52] and that person has the authority let me
[53:54] say this if you count me a fanatic from
[53:57] this not on
[53:59] that very same thing that i'm speaking
[54:01] of will be done
[54:04] that'll be a power remember what a
[54:06] revival is a move of god in power
[54:09] there'll be a power put into the church
[54:12] and now is coming in
[54:14] that the holy spirit will so anoint to
[54:16] people that they'll speak the word and
[54:18] it'll create itself right there
[54:21] we haven't seen powers likes coming into
[54:24] the church now
[54:25] i know it for a fact
[54:29] say unto this mountain and be moved
[54:31] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[54:34] that what you've said shall come to
[54:36] price you can have what you
[54:38] say it the placing of the church in
[54:40] position where the fullness of the power
[54:42] of the holy ghost comes into the church
[54:44] then critics mouth will be shut
[54:47] it'll be a short time
[54:49] jesus come right off the mountain went
[54:52] straight to calvary notice it won't last
[54:54] long
[54:55] now when we came into the message
[54:58] and they were talking a little bit then
[54:59] about the manifested sons and daughters
[55:01] of god and you know what most of the
[55:02] people said then
[55:08] manifested sun is going to be over in
[55:09] the millennium
[55:13] you know why because they didn't believe
[55:15] they could attain unto it right
[55:18] so they put the manifested sons and
[55:19] daughters here some of us are old enough
[55:21] to remember those days
[55:23] and they put it in the millennium well i
[55:25] kept hunting for a quote that i knew
[55:27] brother branham had stated
[55:29] and back then we didn't have the
[55:30] computers but you know what i found it
[55:33] he said we don't need manifested sons in
[55:35] the millennium he said we need them now
[55:40] so then you know
[55:42] that's
[55:43] where we come to it's according to what
[55:45] we believe
[55:48] be a short time
[55:50] all right
[55:51] are you expecting a revival let's read
[55:53] the next one
[55:54] number eight
[55:57] paragraph 182 from the third seal 63
[56:00] 320.
[56:04] that's what's the reason today that the
[56:06] revivals that we're supposed to have
[56:09] we have denominational revivals
[56:12] okay
[56:14] we haven't had a real steering
[56:17] no no no no no
[56:20] sir
[56:21] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[56:24] oh they got millions and millions and
[56:26] millions of church
[56:28] members but not a revival nowhere
[56:32] no no
[56:33] the the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[56:37] see
[56:38] there's been no revival there
[56:41] no manifestation of god to stir the
[56:43] bride yet
[56:45] see
[56:46] we're looking for it
[56:47] it will take those seven unknown
[56:49] thunders back there to wake her up again
[56:52] he will send it he promised it
[56:55] now watch now she was she's dead
[56:59] you remember now what we were talking
[57:00] the other day awake thou that sleepless
[57:04] brother brown said that was a bride in
[57:06] denominations that was asleep
[57:09] all right
[57:11] well right now we read
[57:13] no more sweeping revivals
[57:17] now we've read that the bride hasn't
[57:19] even had the revival yet
[57:26] say well you've really confused me no no
[57:28] no no no no no i didn't confuse you
[57:34] i
[57:34] exposed
[57:37] you being confused
[57:39] i didn't
[57:40] confuse you
[57:44] i just read where the prophet said it
[57:48] you confused your own self
[57:50] all right
[57:56] i don't know where to try to finish her
[58:03] you see like i said
[58:05] i'll try to go as far as i can and then
[58:07] quit
[58:08] like i tried to explain while ago
[58:11] that brother branham mentions revival
[58:14] in a lot of things in a lot of ways
[58:17] you know he says well this revival has
[58:19] been going on for a week or two
[58:21] and then we talk about a revival it's
[58:23] just a short one or this revival has
[58:25] been going on here
[58:28] and he says it won't be no more the
[58:30] pentecostals are looking for a great
[58:32] sweeping worldwide revival he said there
[58:34] won't be no worldwide sweeping revival
[58:39] but have you ever seen what he said
[58:41] about azusa street
[58:46] 1906
[58:52] all right let's read
[58:56] church choosing law for grace 61 318
[58:59] number nine
[59:01] you can go through where he's coming
[59:03] down about azusa street and the things
[59:05] to know that for surety what we're
[59:06] saying is right save the time
[59:09] god has provided for them one of the
[59:11] greatest revivals
[59:13] talking of azusa street
[59:16] because that's back up above there all
[59:17] right
[59:20] that this nation has ever known
[59:24] now look what he's talking about azusa
[59:26] street
[59:28] and you'll see where the scriptures that
[59:30] have been are read three and they'll all
[59:32] come together in the right order
[59:35] i don't care when it was
[59:38] there's never been a revival like the
[59:39] pentecostal revival right
[59:43] wesley never had it none of them had it
[59:45] spurgeon calvin knox
[59:48] great reformers
[59:49] but they never had
[59:51] the revival like the pentecostal revival
[59:54] it's the greatest strength thing that
[59:56] struck the earth
[59:58] since the holy ghost fell on the dead
[1:00:00] pentecost
[1:00:02] nothing right now they got more
[1:00:04] conversions last year the church itself
[1:00:08] put more conversions than almost the
[1:00:11] rest of the churches put together
[1:00:13] you heard billy graham them talking
[1:00:14] about a long time ago
[1:00:16] azusa street
[1:00:19] that we think was a false this
[1:00:24] but remember
[1:00:26] what took place on azusa street
[1:00:31] according to the scripture
[1:00:35] the scripture says that
[1:00:39] from joel
[1:00:41] in acts
[1:00:43] that said in the last days i'll pour out
[1:00:45] my spirit upon all flesh
[1:00:49] and your sons and daughters will
[1:00:50] prophesy
[1:00:52] all right you can use that brother brown
[1:00:54] uses that for the
[1:00:56] pentecostal back there in the bible all
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:00] he uses it that way
[1:01:02] because it was the spirit poured out
[1:01:03] upon all flesh it was poured out back
[1:01:05] there but just remember
[1:01:09] the understanding
[1:01:11] there was 120 in the upper room
[1:01:14] the spirit wasn't poured out just upon
[1:01:16] everything in the original in the book
[1:01:18] of acts
[1:01:20] all right and remember also that even
[1:01:22] the 3000 outside
[1:01:24] it was poured upon
[1:01:26] might have been from around the world
[1:01:28] and the different things but
[1:01:30] it's not exactly the way it is when it
[1:01:32] says in the last days
[1:01:37] but it says in the last days i pour out
[1:01:38] my spirit upon all flesh
[1:01:40] your sons and daughters will prophesy
[1:01:42] your handmaids upon my children and all
[1:01:45] what
[1:01:47] azusa street fulfilled
[1:01:52] the scripture
[1:01:54] because it was poured out upon all flesh
[1:01:58] right
[1:01:59] you had a bunch that was poured out upon
[1:02:01] on azusa street
[1:02:03] that was just
[1:02:06] not like it was in the original in the
[1:02:08] book of acts
[1:02:10] and set up on your sons and your
[1:02:12] daughters in other words
[1:02:14] anointed ones come into view
[1:02:19] right
[1:02:20] you'll talk of anointed ones in the book
[1:02:22] of acts of the 120 or the 3000.
[1:02:27] but in the last days the spirit of god
[1:02:29] is poured out upon all flesh
[1:02:32] the greatest revival that has been since
[1:02:35] the original
[1:02:37] in the book of acts
[1:02:40] and your prophet said that
[1:02:43] well what was wrong
[1:02:45] the pentecostals couldn't see it because
[1:02:48] they were looking for something to be
[1:02:51] one of these days there'll be a great
[1:02:53] worldwide sweeping revival
[1:02:55] millions will be saved
[1:02:59] and the religious world was saying
[1:03:01] seven years tribulation
[1:03:04] and it'll be millions saved
[1:03:07] in that first three and a half years
[1:03:09] of tribulation
[1:03:13] you see the very people that were
[1:03:16] supposed to be resting in the revival
[1:03:19] didn't see what was going on
[1:03:23] do you understand
[1:03:26] do you understand it dire
[1:03:33] was a revival that swept the world
[1:03:37] from azusa street
[1:03:43] went around the world
[1:03:45] great things taking place
[1:03:53] could it be that we could sit right
[1:03:54] among something and not be able to see
[1:03:56] it
[1:04:00] was listening to a tape the other day
[1:04:02] going down hunting and read around and
[1:04:03] said would it be possible for someone to
[1:04:06] hear the voice of god and someone right
[1:04:07] next to him not hear it he said
[1:04:10] yes he said they didn't hear the book of
[1:04:13] acts with paul you know you know how
[1:04:15] that goes and
[1:04:20] see could it be possible
[1:04:22] that we even in this day could be as the
[1:04:26] pentecostals were
[1:04:29] looking for something to happen
[1:04:34] when your prophet said the greatest
[1:04:36] revival
[1:04:38] since the book of acts
[1:04:41] was azusa street
[1:04:43] pentecost
[1:04:47] but yet
[1:04:48] because of what they were taught
[1:04:53] and being taught
[1:04:56] they were looking out
[1:04:58] now is it the quote from the prophet
[1:05:01] what is the biggest problem with mankind
[1:05:04] looking forward to what will be looking
[1:05:06] back to what has been and failing to see
[1:05:08] what's going on now
[1:05:11] so there they were on azusa street the
[1:05:14] greatest revival
[1:05:18] that the world has seen since the day of
[1:05:20] pentecost
[1:05:23] yeah they were looking for something
[1:05:24] else
[1:05:27] well there's nothing wrong with looking
[1:05:29] for something else as long as you don't
[1:05:30] reject what you got
[1:05:32] because remember if you're looking for
[1:05:33] something else
[1:05:34] the only way you can know what that
[1:05:36] something else is is to know what you
[1:05:38] got
[1:05:39] right
[1:05:42] i never have seen a left-handed monkey
[1:05:44] range
[1:05:46] have you
[1:05:48] you ever been working in a place no
[1:05:49] chase go down and get me a left-handed
[1:05:50] monkey ranch
[1:05:54] you know
[1:05:56] well i just laughed and said well
[1:05:58] i'll go hunt for it
[1:06:02] that's a good way to get out of working
[1:06:04] and the boss comes alongs what are you
[1:06:05] doing i'm looking for a left-handed
[1:06:06] monkey wrench they told me to go look
[1:06:08] for it
[1:06:10] okay
[1:06:12] general motors you could put a fireplace
[1:06:13] in your back pocket and walk around all
[1:06:14] day and nobody said nothing but you went
[1:06:16] out of the employer your backpack
[1:06:18] you know
[1:06:20] but listen
[1:06:23] i've never seen some of those things
[1:06:25] right
[1:06:26] so i don't know what to look for
[1:06:29] you know i've never seen a left-handed
[1:06:30] monkey right so i don't know what to
[1:06:31] look for
[1:06:32] he said well just turn it over well
[1:06:34] i know that
[1:06:36] but
[1:06:37] my point is what
[1:06:40] if you don't have something
[1:06:42] with inside of
[1:06:44] you to know what it is what good is it
[1:06:48] doing for you to go looking
[1:06:54] i'll put this in and then we'll get into
[1:06:56] this evening because i'll just
[1:06:57] close it
[1:06:58] if you don't have the new birth
[1:07:02] which is the greatest revival
[1:07:04] to an individual
[1:07:08] he said well now wait a minute because
[1:07:09] you revive and you you said well go
[1:07:11] revive us to yeah well let's get the new
[1:07:14] birth but then after you get to new
[1:07:16] birth you know what a revival is
[1:07:18] because you know where you was revived
[1:07:20] or saved and you know what it is to
[1:07:22] climb up the pyramid right all right
[1:07:25] but think about it
[1:07:27] the greatest revival
[1:07:30] and yet people are looking out from
[1:07:31] warsaw
[1:07:36] let me give you one more then we'll quit
[1:07:38] on that part okay go number 10.
[1:07:44] he says taking go awake jesus 1963. see
[1:07:48] i hope you follow me on what i'm saying
[1:07:51] because see we start off with a 65 quote
[1:07:54] revivaled over we drop down to a 56
[1:07:57] quote
[1:07:59] you know or talk about a 56
[1:08:01] and says revival's over
[1:08:03] then we take a 63 in the middle and says
[1:08:05] it ain't come yet
[1:08:07] well now the man was massively confused
[1:08:10] or
[1:08:11] he was saying something that would be
[1:08:13] hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[1:08:15] prudent
[1:08:17] but we would be revealed to those who
[1:08:20] had had an
[1:08:23] that's experience and know what to look
[1:08:24] for
[1:08:26] brother are you looking for a great why
[1:08:28] why
[1:08:29] no
[1:08:30] no
[1:08:34] but i've always looked for a revival
[1:08:37] because i've always been in one
[1:08:41] all right
[1:08:42] look what he says
[1:08:46] and i think that
[1:08:47] a whole lot applies to this time where
[1:08:49] we're at living
[1:08:51] revival that we just been through now
[1:08:53] that's a compound
[1:08:55] because remember you're getting up in
[1:08:57] 63.
[1:08:58] i'll cover it this evening there's two
[1:09:00] revivals you got to consider
[1:09:02] to overlap them
[1:09:05] or you'll miss the whole point brother
[1:09:06] brown is making
[1:09:08] revival that we've just been through
[1:09:10] this pentecostal revival
[1:09:14] great healing revival that shook the
[1:09:16] entire world around
[1:09:19] just think
[1:09:20] revival fires is burning on every hill
[1:09:23] over the world around and around the
[1:09:25] world i travel it constantly fixing to
[1:09:28] make another world tour in every land
[1:09:30] and every nation the revival fires of
[1:09:32] pentecost is burning the presbyterian
[1:09:35] are receiving it the baptist
[1:09:37] the lutheran the methodist
[1:09:39] is sure it surely is the last watch
[1:09:42] that when god is calling his people in
[1:09:45] these great fires of revival are burning
[1:09:50] zeus street revival
[1:09:55] because remember one thing and we'll
[1:09:57] pick it up this evening
[1:10:01] if it is a revival
[1:10:04] it has no end
[1:10:11] if it is a revival from god it has no
[1:10:13] end
[1:10:16] it's just you got to know which way to
[1:10:18] go
[1:10:19] and what's going on
[1:10:22] do you understand what i've brought so
[1:10:24] far then
[1:10:28] that we're not looking for a worldwide
[1:10:29] sweeping revival no
[1:10:34] and even to the jews
[1:10:36] it won't be a worldwide sweeping effect
[1:10:38] but it's called that because of the
[1:10:40] great signs and wonders that will
[1:10:42] transpire of the clothes and the sun the
[1:10:44] stars of things happening all of the
[1:10:46] different things to israel
[1:10:49] but the key is it'll be just to them
[1:10:52] there'll be no revival for a gentile
[1:10:54] they won't be one gentile saved
[1:10:56] in the tribulation why because they
[1:10:59] rejected it
[1:11:01] when it ended a gentile dispensation
[1:11:03] there will be no more salvation for
[1:11:04] gentiles
[1:11:06] all right
[1:11:07] it goes to the jews he's not dealing
[1:11:09] with two different two nations at the
[1:11:11] same time then he's dealing with israel
[1:11:14] in her revival
[1:11:16] through those two prophets
[1:11:18] great things will take place but
[1:11:20] people have looked at that you know and
[1:11:22] thought well that's what's coming
[1:11:25] that's what's coming
[1:11:28] brother branham even relates it i got it
[1:11:29] on the desk at the home there he even
[1:11:31] relates he says that something compared
[1:11:35] and he says israel will see
[1:11:37] him coming after the bride and think
[1:11:39] that
[1:11:40] he's coming after them
[1:11:43] so evidently something must be
[1:11:46] going to be transpiring
[1:11:49] all right
[1:11:51] so we'll stop right there and just
[1:11:53] leave that because if i continue i'll go
[1:11:56] to 12 31 o'clock
[1:11:58] all right we'll end it there and we'll
[1:11:59] start this evening i'll give you time to
[1:12:01] think
[1:12:04] give you time to consider
[1:12:06] that your prophet will say the revival's
[1:12:08] over then he'll say you ain't even had
[1:12:10] one yet
[1:12:13] but all along he says no more sweeping
[1:12:16] revivals worldwide
[1:12:19] yet he drops back to azusa street
[1:12:24] and i'll give it to you ahead of time
[1:12:25] he brings in himself
[1:12:28] as the great revival that he spearheaded
[1:12:33] that has went around the world
[1:12:41] what are we going to do with that
[1:12:43] where you and i going to come out of it
[1:12:49] i'll give you one life statement then
[1:12:51] we'll quit
[1:12:53] the prophet said the pastor can't bring
[1:12:54] a revival one preacher can't
[1:12:57] but he says the people can
[1:13:00] all right
[1:13:01] martin luther protested the catholic
[1:13:03] church
[1:13:05] the catholic church wasn't upset with
[1:13:06] him about it
[1:13:08] but when the people began to follow
[1:13:09] after what luther was saying they got
[1:13:11] highly upset
[1:13:13] a revival started in the people
[1:13:15] because of what the man taught
[1:13:22] i want you to understand one thing
[1:13:26] i am not talking about brother dale
[1:13:30] going to spearhead a revival
[1:13:32] in the end time
[1:13:38] i hope you followed the lineup this
[1:13:40] evening
[1:13:41] brother branham has already spearheaded
[1:13:44] this revival
[1:13:47] now if one person catches it it's got to
[1:13:49] catch on somewhere
[1:13:52] and then i'll just contend i'm one of
[1:13:53] them and i'll contend it all the way
[1:13:55] down through here that i've been looking
[1:13:56] for a revival but i've been right in the
[1:13:59] middle of it too
[1:14:00] having a good time
[1:14:04] i sit there on a deer stand sometimes
[1:14:06] i'll go through three tapes
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:09] thing they made for me years ago i wore
[1:14:11] that thing out and wore it out and wore
[1:14:12] it out i just put it in
[1:14:16] because it's going to be looking you can
[1:14:18] you know
[1:14:20] three tapes sometimes just
[1:14:22] rotate
[1:14:25] one thing it keeps me awake
[1:14:31] one thing it passes time real good
[1:14:34] but then sometimes i just get something
[1:14:36] and i take out my little
[1:14:38] flagging tape and start writing on the
[1:14:40] side of it
[1:14:42] you know
[1:14:43] i thought
[1:14:45] as long as i get the thought and get a
[1:14:46] lineup don't worry about the rest of it
[1:14:47] they'll come into view
[1:14:50] but come on
[1:14:51] musicians
[1:14:54] see i'm
[1:14:56] myself
[1:14:59] i have never been down and out about the
[1:15:01] revealing of god's word
[1:15:06] and i could say it without any remorse
[1:15:08] of anything
[1:15:10] and it's been god to do it now i haven't
[1:15:12] followed after all of these two souls
[1:15:14] two lords seventh under virtue of
[1:15:15] prusions river jordan all these
[1:15:18] doctrines and it's been god it ain't
[1:15:19] been me
[1:15:23] but i'm gonna say i haven't done it
[1:15:26] and i'd like for somebody to come show
[1:15:27] me i have
[1:15:29] they just never been able to put me in a
[1:15:31] camp nowhere
[1:15:33] i just don't fit in
[1:15:35] well you know why
[1:15:38] because i just can't find the god there
[1:15:41] that i know
[1:15:44] i'm sorry
[1:15:47] you know
[1:15:48] but i just want to be me
[1:15:52] and that'll take care of everything
[1:15:53] right go ahead brother what we've got
[1:15:54] let's take them
[1:15:56] anybody have a need
[1:16:00] 654 anybody have an aide
[1:16:10] it's beginning to rain
[1:16:14] rain hear the voice of the father
[1:16:21] he's saying whosoever
[1:16:24] will come drink of this water
[1:16:30] he's promised to pour
[1:16:40] if you're thirsty and dry
[1:16:43] look up to the skies
[1:17:00] he's saying
[1:17:03] whosoever will come drink of his water
[1:17:10] he promised to pour
[1:17:12] his spirit out on his sons and his
[1:17:16] daughters
[1:17:19] if you're thirsty and dry
[1:17:22] look up to the sky
[1:17:28] think about
[1:17:42] he said this is not the latter rain
[1:17:46] he said because you haven't had the
[1:17:48] former ray
[1:17:54] he played around messages in the form of
[1:17:56] rain
[1:18:01] but the quickening of that
[1:18:03] it's a lighter rain
[1:18:05] take it up to him and think about it
[1:18:07] it's beginning to rain
[1:18:12] hear the voice of the father
[1:18:17] he says
[1:18:26] he promised to pour his spirit out
[1:18:31] on his daughter
[1:18:36] if you're thirsty and dry look
[1:18:45] that are already born again
[1:19:07] people that are letting me in that
[1:19:08] revival
[1:19:10] and you know what
[1:19:12] then they'd be revived
[1:19:27] hear the voice of the father
[1:19:32] he says
[1:19:46] on his sons and his daughter
[1:20:00] think about it
[1:20:04] former rain
[1:20:06] ladder rain
[1:20:12] great something was going on
[1:20:17] that prophet knew what it was
[1:20:20] but how could he explain it
[1:20:25] when the people couldn't even see
[1:20:27] that their pentecostal revival of
[1:20:30] azusa street
[1:20:32] was the greatest the world
[1:20:35] why couldn't they return to that
[1:20:40] no
[1:20:42] they had something out younger
[1:20:44] they thought was coming well that's
[1:20:46] wonderful
[1:20:48] but
[1:20:49] when we found out that's not for them
[1:20:53] so what good is it to look for something
[1:20:55] to come that doesn't belong to you
[1:21:03] i love the scripture
[1:21:06] behold i send
[1:21:09] you
[1:21:11] elijah the prophet
[1:21:15] but around his wife
[1:21:17] wondering where to marry him or not
[1:21:22] the voice spoke to her and said
[1:21:24] behold i send you
[1:21:26] elijah the prophet
[1:21:29] you know what
[1:21:30] she wasn't right i don't marry that guy
[1:21:34] why because
[1:21:35] she knew what that was
[1:21:38] in relation
[1:21:39] you knew that that fellow had spoke
[1:21:41] about it enough there had to be
[1:21:43] something about him
[1:21:45] that was related to it so he said okay
[1:21:47] i'll just go marry elijah
[1:21:51] right
[1:21:53] you see church we ain't
[1:21:56] you know we're missing our goal
[1:21:59] we're missing our
[1:22:03] what's going on
[1:22:05] because we already preconceived
[1:22:08] in our ideas
[1:22:11] and thoughts
[1:22:14] that's just seeing that as you leave and
[1:22:16] thinking about it
[1:22:17] it's beginning to rain
[1:22:36] he
[1:22:50] it's beginning
[1:23:10] foreign
