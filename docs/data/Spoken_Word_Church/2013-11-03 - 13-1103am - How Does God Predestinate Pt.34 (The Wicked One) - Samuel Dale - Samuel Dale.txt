we thank you for this day in the hour that we have and for the time that we've been able to come together and to and you just sat down for a little bit and take a little time this morning out of the hustle and bustle of the business of our life to be able to just sit down and and talk about you a little bit and fellowship Lord and that's truly what we love to do and we ask you to just come Among Us this morning and open Thy word unto us because that's our desire is to speak about you and Lord to just have you have your way with each and every one of us forgive our sins and cleanse Us by the blood and keep us in your grace have your way bless those that are not here today remember the sick among us you said that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you we commit it in your hands now have your way in Jesus name amen Romans eight we've been reading this for quite a while because we're we're on the basis of of talking about predestination and how that God predestinates by his foreknowledge now we've got over endogenesis to kind of see life upon Earth and the coming into these things so just remember this Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified now I love this part right what shall then shall we then say to these things in the words if all this is right what do we say if God be for us who can be against us that's a wonderful thing let's go over to Genesis two and we'll pick up verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust to the ground and breathed into his nostrils to the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now notice two trees one of them is the Tree of Life and we know for certain the tree of life is Jesus Christ because without him there is no life so that's easy to understand that that we talk about the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what kind of a tree is that all right verse 16 to just pick up the point 15 he put man in the garden to dress the garden 16 and the Lord God commanded a man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thy surely die he may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we have been up and down in backwards and forth and doing a lot of things and I thought today uh we would just try to take a lot of scriptures and deal with that in uh understanding but we we certainly believe the word of God I believe it's true and and believe it's forever settled and we don't have to worry about it because it is his word and who else's word could we take outside of the word of God because he gave us his word all right now as we've studied for quite a bit now talking about it this two trees as I said we know that Jesus Christ is a tree of life because there's no life outside of Christ there's no no life outside of God coming down and fellowshipping with man and then dying for our sins to pay the price that you and I could receive eternal life all right so it's easy to understand the Tree of Life all right but remember there was another tree there called a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now we know that Jesus Christ the physical body you know human element man uh was not standing in the garden there was trees you know the whole garden was full of trees but it it singles out to trees to speak of there and we know that as I said Jesus Christ wasn't standing there as a person all right but he was there in the symbolic of the Tree of Life all right we know Satan is uh a spirit being created spirit being he's not a man like a human man element uh and all like that we talk about the guy with the two horns you know and we all of those things but uh remember he's a spirit being was created he was the anointed cherub the Bible covers in Ezekiel and Isaiah and how that he was in Eden and he was Dire in representation as Christ was Dire in representation of the Tree of Life all right but now I've asked you questions over and over about it what kind of a tree is it that you could look at and it would be a tree of knowledge a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what kind of a tree is that I would like to know about that tree if you could help me uh my oh I'm I don't have Alzheimer's I got old timers and my memory is going away and I sure would like to be able to eat some of these things if you know that would help me you do the best you can with the herbs and things that comes out of the Earth but boy wouldn't it be something to to be able to eat of a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you know if it was just something to eat of but remember in the Bible that when it's speaking of these things remember it is written so that the wise and prudent the scripture says would miss it but the babes in Christ would that was what Jesus said about it would be able to receive it all right so now they were told that they could eat of all the trees that was in the garden verse 17 there we got to 16 and you know in other words I could eat the apples they could eat the pears the peaches the plums the you know all of the trees that was in the garden but they were told verse 17. to not eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil God if he did that day you would die all right at this specific time in verse or chapter 2 we know that Eve had not come into being yet Adam was still there if you read your Bible you know and Eve was in Adam a rib was taken out of Adam over into the second chapter going toward the end and made Eve out of it you know all right because that was making her a part of him and he said this is Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bones which was right you know that would have been the truth because she came out of him the other animals were created male and female dog male and female horse male and female cow you know well uh the animals but when it comes to creation of mankind he created Adam if you'll read chapter 2 there and he created him but Eve was in Adam all right then God separated or took a rib and took it out and and made a body he didn't take her from the dust of the earth like he did the other female animals because he was going to make her very close to Adam Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone he said that's why that a man is to leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife it doesn't say for the girl to have to leave her mom and daddy right yeah all right it says for the man you know to leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they become one all right and he made him a help meat not a help mate we want to translate that a lot of times mate but it's not in the Scripture it says make him help meat someone like him are with him or part of him all right and when that happened then they were put in the garden to uh you know to be happy and have a good time and in verse 25 you find a very unusual situation because it says and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed we look at things you know in a way as a human beings because as I tried to explain the other day you you take there a while back you take those little kids uh one two maybe three years old you might put a little boy in the bathtub with a little girl it might not be too bad but after the good little age on them don't do that oh but my kids don't know your kids just like everybody else according to the psalmist David he said we were born in sin shaping an iniquity and a spouse from our mother's wound a liar you know you look down at a little baby and you don't want to say it because it's derogatory against it but you look at it and you say that well look look at that little liar laying there you don't teach a baby how to lie it gets to be a couple of years old and it's got cookie all over its mouth cookie all over his hand and you ask I said you got to cook and he said see that's because we were born into Satan's domain because of the fall in the garden all right now whatever you do remember what happened in the garden was unbelief we first must approach it that way because that's the truth of it it's unbelief see they didn't believe Eve didn't believe God would keep his word all right so we're going to read that in just a second and get into it she didn't believe God would keep his word she was deceived but remember she went into unbelief there is only one sin that's unbelief drinking gambling smoking running around with women is an attribute or a display of the unbelief see before a woman can receive a man she has to First receive him in her spirit being or in other words her reasoning or memories or Consciousness before anything literal can take place all right but see two trees now what kind of a tree would be the tree of knowledge instead of Good and Evil and like I always say we rode to church today and needed just a little bit of heat you know because it was cool and it wasn't like the old days riding in a horse and buggy you know and or riding away models when you didn't have anything or it was there's some good about a lot of things scientific knowledge is good to a degree and that's wonderful you know I I like a house that's warm and I don't have to go out and cut all the wood and build a fire which is enjoyable to do and a lot of people do that and Heat their homes but you know I'm just a little lazy I guess and I just kind of on that style I heard the turn the thermostat up scientific knowledge we ride on airplanes we we go about the country you know where it used to take a year to cross the United States Maybe but now you can just get in a plane there you are and that's that's all of that scientific knowledge you remember that come off the tree of knowledge all right but now get back to the point if the tree of life would be symbolic of Jesus Christ for by him came life then what would be the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and why would God tell Even Adam before Eve was taken from him to not partake of that tree of knowledge and good and evil because in the day you do you're going to die well all right they did partake of that tree now physically speaking they never died that day all right but they died in less than a thousand years because Methuselah was 969 years old the oldest man you know and Mankind has never lived a thousand years 969 pretty close but they still didn't live all right now I'm quoting scripture just coming through Anna see then it was told the day you eat thereof that day you die all right so the Bible says a thousand years a day and a day is a thousand years that's scripture all right so we can say well God created the world in six days you know or whatever or we could say he created six thousand years what would it make any difference because a thousand years is a day in a day is a thousand years so we're covering the point of understanding all right but this tree of life if it was symbolic of Jesus Christ now then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil would be symbolic of Satan right because he'd already been kicked out of heaven he got exalted in his unbelief and what is it Isaiah or Ezekiel 1 said heart thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning see he was the anointed cherub that was created perfect in his doings but he went in his own ways in his own knowledge and it took him into unbelief and God gave him the right of free moral agency to be able to choose and he chose to do wrong because he wanted to be number one all right so when it happened in the garden that God created man Satan could not create it can cause a lot of confusion right but he can't create that's withholding from it because that was the ability that God had alone to be able to create man and to do what he was doing the world with Satan could pervert all right so his his goal was to come to Earth and cause the same thing he did in heaven which was war according to Revelations 12 and said Michael and his angels fought and Lucifer and his angels fought and he was cast out of Heaven that was not necessarily a war of movies it was a a an order or uh bringing to the place that those demons could not stay there any longer and they were cast out but he came to Earth and and those demons are the things that anoint you and I you say no well what causes the baby to lie you laughed at that a minute ago and shook ahead yeah but what caused the baby to lie it was not Mom and Daddy they didn't lie right see we're born in Satan's domain Kingdom all right you remember he offered it to Jesus you remember when they went up on the mountain not in the scripture in the gospel and see Satan offered all of these things to Jesus and he said ah well see Satan has control look at him he's really the prince and power of the hour out here he's you know these storms and things are not of God they can be used of God to do whatever but it's Satan's domain something happened in the garden that brought death upon mankind and that that happened was the horrible situation now first it was for Eve to disbelieve God's word she started as we'll read in explaining because ours where our Trouble Comes we all like to think we have a good bit of knowledge you know we like to think that we know something and we enjoy telling other people how we know you sisters love to talk about how to cook you know but you don't want to talk to my wife about how to cook even though she's the best cook in the building I don't back off of that at all right most of you will agree with it but when you ask her said how do you do this you said you take a pinch of salt and a shake of sugar and she never measures anything but it turned out wonderful why because she's learned to measure but what she's doing all right now if you read a recipe recipe that my wife gave you and she said a pinch of salt you'd say well how much is a pinch you know I mean you know and what's this much he'll say put this much Greece you know what you call it crisco's whatever what you call it you know you put that much well the recipe says put a cup well she's got the cup all right what are you talking about the main point is talking about that when we read the Bible let's read the Bible for itself and not read it for somebody that's interpreting the pinch or the cup or how much what is reading What God Says but when he said something remember that he's hiding it according to what he said in the gospels now he said I think the old father thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent right and what and revealed it unto babes such as we'll learn all right so we need to think about a lot of things but this tree of knowledge now it's not a literal tree no more than the tree of life was a literal tree but it's the tree of life was Jesus Christ and symbolic then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which brought death would have to be symbolic in the basis of Satan the devil Lucifer whatever you want to call him it would have to be in a symbolic form because he would not be their standing there see he's he's right here in the church today but so is Christ right here because that's in another world of spirit Realm that we we don't see all right but now thinking about it a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Satan will give you so much good to try to attract your attention right as I covered a second ago he offered Jesus and we know Jesus Christ came to die right to save the world save everybody right but everybody won't be saved but he come for that still and he come to save the world even and it will one day be changed and all right so it was placed there within him to you know bring life is placed in Satan in his foolings in his nature and ways is to bring death and that's why we can follow it through the scriptures but so much good of it sometimes is real good but it's it turns out to be bad all right now so remember the two trees symbolic of Jesus Christ symbolic of Satan all right as I said we think of Satan with the horns we think of him as the bad guy we think of him as the devil but remember he used that beast in the garden we'll read in a second to talk to Eve all right he's a spirit being he can do things he's great don't think in even Bible the Bible said Daniel was not a match for the devil and don't you think you and I are ever a match for him either you think you're a match for the Devil he's done got you you don't want to worry about it Jesus Christ is the only one that could ever conquer the devil even over in the Book of Daniel you remember the great great Archangel Gabriel was coming to Daniel read the book of Daniel and as he was coming to Daniel the Bible said he was hindered 21 days he couldn't get to Daniel because the devil was hindering him so Christ had to come on and say Michael came to the aid of Gabriel and he took over and Gabriel could come on to Daniel all right getting a little story in the Bible terminologies of what we're talking about so remember you're not playing with just something that's not strong and deceiving and and deliberately remember as I said he offered Jesus the world and as I was saying that why did Jesus come forth to die for the world right and he offered it to him in other words he said you don't have to die see Satan is very very shrewd he has a knowledge even of the principles of life he knows all the things he knew what Jesus Christ was here for and he said I'll give it to you but Jesus said no I've got to pay the price hey he offered him the opportunity to bypass death but he rejected that because he knew what that would mean just remember when somebody comes along wants to give you something you get them phone calls right we are in your area and we are doing this and we would like to give you you better hang up don't say well I might listen to you no you better hang up because anything that's free has got some links to it the prophet would say about Jesus he knew if he took that as Satan offered it Satan would still have his ear marks on it so we're going to let him have his hands on none of it you remember Abraham was offered a burial place for his wife Sarah when she died you remember that in the Bible what's Christ there what's what happened Abraham said no I purchased the property the man said I'll give it to you they said no I purchase the property because you don't know no uh it's good and evil which is not a good in it but then it turned out evil and runs in the wrong direction all right see now think about that as we go along into thinking of what we're saying that the devil is he comes to you in a way that's real soft and nice I've heard people say you know no I said the devil's talking to me well I I agree he does but now how are you going to know the difference between the devil talking to you and God talking to you oh brother Dale the devil talks mean and rough and tough and the Lord said oh I love you that's not exactly all the Bible what about when God sometimes tells you sit down and shut up and listen remember when they were offering them an opportunity there to to the animals in the temple when the poor old people couldn't go out and do much and they set it up in the temple and they said well sure we'll just put a place in here we'll put some animals in here and we'll we'll sell you the animals you don't have to go out and and here comes Jesus alone what'd he do he took a rope and he planted it which meant it took him a little time he thought it over and he started frailing the Daylights out of him and run them out of the Temple right didn't sound too good did it but he said you took my house this to be a house of prayer and you made it to den of Thieves the condo priest was standing there saying but I'm the one that let them do this which one sounded like it was the best guy come on that's how Satan does he's very deceiving he's very slow about doing it doesn't bother him to take a long time to talk to you what we're going to get into in the garden just remember it was not a five minute affair no telling how long the devil talked through the Beast to Eve before he got her into unbelief all right see it's not just a whole lot of doings it's whether or not we can stay you say well how do you know then as I said how do you know whether it's God talking to you or whether it's the devil talking to you go back and check it in the word to see what's right right you remember there in the Bible where that came up there who was it Ahab and um Jehoshaphat what was his name Jehoshaphat anyhow they had 400 Hebrew Prophets that all prophesied to go up the God has given you the land we remember Micah he said no the Lord didn't tell me that the Lord told me you're going to be destroyed well you know who they're going to believe the four Hebrews for 100 400 prophets over one man but yet he was telling them the word why because he had went back in the word Maca hit and he had seen that God had already cursed Jezebel and Ahab and said the dogs will eat your bones all right check it with the words what I'm saying what anybody says to you go back to the Bible with it and see if the Bible says that you remember the good things are always the tantalizing you know sometimes God just says to Nicodemus you remember that you must be born again a man that was the most religious leader because he was called the teacher in Israel that's what Jesus referred to it the greatest of all and yet he rebuked him and says you don't understand what I'm talking about because you must be born again a man that had lived in church all of his life all he ever done was in church you know as we call it today serving God all of his life and here comes God to him he says you need to be born again well see that's what we need we need a new birth all right but now think about it two trees one symbolic of Satan one symbolic of Christ let's see the outcome of what would be partaking of that the prophet of God said it one day like this he said the Tree of Life was in the garden to remind Adam that his youth was being renewed daily or an ongoing process all right and you know they could eat of the Tree of Life those two tourists because they tell them there's only one tree that you can't eat of them remember as Adam was seeing life being renewed each day because his body was not eternal right and he was seeing his youth renewed then he could see Christ and he could follow that all right but to eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil would be immediate death so which one do we want to eat off of today you know they're before us right now the same two trees it was dark right except before you and I right now and we don't blame Adam and Eve for watching what's going on now right remember we're all a free moral agent and remember we're all given as was called an age of accountability which nobody knows exactly what that is but you know because it's according to your mental ability and uh it's placed before us we can eat of what tree we want to eat of and to remember the word eat as we'll get to it in a minute the word eat is a word that's called it comes from a form of light partaking you know we ate some of brother Al's chili yesterday we ate some of your cookies and some of your your cakes that you made are wonderful but that means partaking see as I said we we read something and we we get the wrong concept because we don't consider are we like Nicodemus when Jesus said you must be born again what did he say you mean I've got to go now read your scripture I've got to go back in my mother's wound and come forth again that's all he could comprehend about what Jesus was saying but the original translation says Jesus was saying You must be born from above because born from the earth we do us no good all right so then let's get down to the understanding and read the Bible then as we see it and understand what it's saying and get it into the right understanding all right now so let's go over to and we'll put it up here where you can read it from that way you can read your Bible it'll be glad to let you take it out see where it's right or not unless the brothers make some goof up somewhere back there it's going to be out of the King James version you know I read other translations and things but I I still like the King James version because it's there and and this is really not the 1611 King James version because you don't even have that uh anybody's ever seen a 1611. um translation of the Bible it's about that big and yeah big it's you look on your thing and it says King James version well if you look you'll see that it was back in the best you can go well Schofield is 1909. uh you know into bringing it but the original King James version has a little bit different wordings but I've read some of it to check to see where and I I believe that we have the you know the King James version brought down to Modern time and I don't believe in the modern Doctrine or modern things of a lot of the Bibles that they bring good news for Modern Man Etc why do you want to change anything to be good news I thought the gospel was good news I thought you must be born again I didn't know that had to be translated I thought it had to be believed all right see then we don't need somebody to tell us what it is but yet it's good to read those things well let's just look and read let's talk about these things in the garden and just consider it a minute of what the Bible is actually saying now we got your story Adam and Eve Adam created and even Adam taken from Adam made into her own individual part of her and placed in the garden told they could eat of every tree that's in the garden but other tree of knowledge of Good and Evil not to eat of that because it would bring death right now you may not agree with what we speak here about it and talk about it but we'll just read the Bible to see what's right or not but remember the original sin is unbelief so what Satan done he got Eve to disbelieve God's word now that's that's the simple point that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is for Satan to get you and I to disbelieve God's word see we're talking about Mankind that God is a good god I agree with you but he's also a just God we say he's a savior that's I agree with you but he's also a judge there's a lot about the Bible we must get together all right all right to understand it all right but remember now before we start and you you call it later and say well brother Dale this is not you the original sin is unbelief Jesus said if you believe not you're condemned already see that's scripture all right we must believe in God all right not just take our thoughts and our ideas and you know kind of like it a little bit it's whether or not it's true all right so remember now the background story behind this is Moses wrote Genesis Exodus Leviticus number of Deuteronomy the first five books if I didn't get five there is he wrote the first five books all right now how did Moses know what happened in the garden right I mean oh you get hand down stories you know what are you gonna no no no how did Moses know what happened in the garden how did he know about a garden or a tree of knowledge of good and evil or it was revealed unto him by the Lord you remember a prophet the word of God comes to the prophet so he wrote five books all right trying to get us to understand God in those five books now with all that behind us look at what it says Genesis 3 and 1 says now the serpent was more subtle which is a deceiving you know capable of doing things that any Beast of the we feel which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea if God said he shall not eat of every tree of the garden now listen to it but remember first what it's saying there's a vast difference between a serpent and a beast right a serpent is a snake crawling animal Etc a beast is an upright creature all right now this animal as we talk about this Beast it could talk it did because Satan wasn't talking to Eve himself he was talking through the Beast all right as we tried to explain to you before had they brought that to us in school we wouldn't have had Darwin's theory and Darwin's theory he could follow up the chain of creation but when he got to to the monkey he couldn't cross over to the man it was withholding from him but he had he read the Bible and found out see this serpent the tree of knowledge the serpent was symbolic of Satan he's called a serpent in the Book of Revelations he's called a serpent Through the Bible like it says to Eve you know in second Corinthians 11 3. less through his sceptility the serpent that beguiled Eve or now what happened in the Garden that made this horrible situation that you and I exist in which we exist in our in a situation of death right no matter what you think you're getting older you know no matter what you think you can pretty up all you want to but you are getting older you know your husband can tell you honey you look prettier than you 20 years ago but just remember he's lying right because we're getting older that's just normal right the Bible says about Jesus you know it was about 33 years ago you know what the Bible said about him he said you're a man of not 50. in other words because of his his doings he wound up being looking like he was wore out that's why I like these two drawings of of Hoffman's and if you look at them real close this drawing was made of Hoffman by Hoffman of what he believed Christ looked like that's fine but that was made at 33 I mean at 30 when he was 30 years of eight this one was made by Hoffman years later and he's called the 33. that's why I have those two you know why because I'm the one that caused him to age and I'm between that so I keep them there all right see age is death right it's just death whether we like it or not we're just dying but we need to find something about these trees is what's killing us because the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is killing us hey like we said while ago I appreciate the automobiles but you know what there's more people killed every year in automobile accidents than any year of any war that we ever had right in the Hiroshima and nakasaki every how you pronounce those words when they drop those two bombs 100 000 people or more but yet there's a whole lot more than that killed in car wrecks because that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil well let's watch it get started so the serpent was more subtle than any Beast in the Bible simply telling you now we'll go through if we get time we'll go through and show that God cursed returned Genesis he cursed the Beast and it became a snake just called upon by barely shalt thou crawl right and duck shall be thy me he walked upright I don't think Eve would have been out there talking to a snake would you put a nice looking guy walk up you might talk to him right remember as I said Darwin he couldn't cross that link between man and the monkey have you read the Bible and found out there was a beast there that was an upright creature an animal uh situation that was close to the human he said well how do you know that because the Bible says it all right the Beast an upright creature the serpent snake that's easy to understand and as I said and I keep saying it I like to I like to repeat things because you know repetitive means you'll remember it he wouldn't talk to a snake she'd been more apt to talk to a monkey right I don't talk to snakes do you know but remember he wasn't a snake to start with why would God curse him and tell him up on your belly shall you crawl because he went some other way he was a beast a creature there that we don't talk about because we don't know about what the Bible knows about it but look and watch what he does and he the Beast he Satan talking through that Beast to Eve instead of the woman yeah hath God say it and watch him you shall not eat of every tree of the garden you know that's what God's he didn't say that did he now God never said that God said you could eat of every tree but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so now here's a good woman preacher that we don't agree because this word started out because he was the first one have nothing against women you know I was born from one I have a good wife I have a good daughter-in-laws good daughter I don't know I I take I stand up for the Sisters but I also know that she was the first preacher because she preached to the devil right but look how tricky he was God never said you can't eat of evertree God says you can eat of every tree but to one tree so look how easily Satan is starting to talk to her now she comes back what does she say and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die she corrected him but that was his deception he got heard of talking there's the biggest problem not women that's us men and all remember the Bible says in Adam all die so we don't blame he for everything you know but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman he shall not surely die what for God doesn't know that in the day you eat the Earth then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing Good and Evil there's the tree right knowledge of Good and Evil her lust for knowledge brought unbelief into her being right you know like I walk up to you and I tell you something and see if I deceive you into getting you to talk I've got you trapped all I got to do is just get you to explain it to me I'm on your side the devil's not all that mean big old guy with the horns as a matter of fact the Bible says that his ministers are as the Ministers of righteousness which means preachers right preachers in the pulpits the most damaging thing why because they're going to tell you what they think God said he said well that's what you're going to do well let's see what it's right or not all right go and watch at him for God doesn't know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing Good and Evil right and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit in our oven to eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat now people will say well what they've done in the garden is they ate an apple all right some of them come up and say well now they ate a pomegranate or a power or some form of fruit and we won't get time to get to it this morning but we've been over it you know that when Cain went to come to offer his offering you remember Abel offered the blood of the animal you remember that McCain offered the fruit of the land proven he still thought Mama knew what she was talking about why remember the first thing is he got her to disbelieve God are in other words to doubt God would keep his word right right because God said you die the devil slips around with it and he comes up to the point of saying you shall not die put it in plain language to us today what would he be saying God loves you we're not what we said while ago the world preaches today God is a good god that's wonderful it's a good God but he's also a god of judgment right he's a god of judgment all right but look what it says and saw that the tree was good for food right now I go blunt to start with and then back up all right I do not believe that you can cover anywhere in the Bible to talk about any form of a apple orange pomegranate Peach Plum whatever a fruit that would be the cause of the fall or the attribute that went with what they done first it was unbelief it's always got to be in that display now I ask you simple questions for you to think about if a if they ate any form of fruit any form a fruit why did Jesus Christ have to be born from a wound of a woman it's a simple question I'd like a simple answer why did Jesus have to come through the wound of a woman why couldn't God just step out he'd done it before he stepped out there in melchester right you know her Abraham read your Bible you come to Abraham one day Mel shattered it God in human flesh melt says that called him God I mean Abraham called him God he could create any time he wants to but why did he have to come through the wound of a woman and when they did wind up as the story Will Go On if they were eating apples oranges pears plums why was it that God killed the animals and put skins on and made a bloody atonement for him read your Bible read your Bible see if God made skins from the animals and covered them why didn't he give them a little patch to put over their mouth like brother Ernie Villanueva says why didn't he make a little thing to put up here if it was eaten now we're adults right we're adults when God made Adam and Eve's skins to cover them remember they had already made skins or coverings of fig leaves we'll get through that in the Bible read it they made them some coverage why because the ending of what it was said in Chapter 2 was that they were naked and knew it not but then when this situation took place they wound up being naked and they themselves made them fig leaves read your Bible to cover their body did you cover their mouth no no playing sensible as I said to start with put the kids in the bathtub one or two years old not no problem don't put them in there after you get three or four years old they're going to start figuring out what each other's got you say you I don't know a preacher or not talk like that why not you send your kids to sex education some idiot in school tells them all about it and describes it and even shows them how right well yet you'd say well the preacher or not use words like that why not sure we're human beings the Bible uses it why can't we he said well brother Dale what in the world do you think happened in the garden will you explain to me what happened why did Eve stage will read the minute the Beast he defiled he beguiled me why would she talk like that I hope I have time to get to it why would the Bible speak of Cain and Abel read your Bible 4 1. Adam knew his wife and she conceived and brought forth came and again Abel it doesn't say he had another time Cain and Abel were twins he said that's no problem I'm a twins but what about twins from different daddies you say no that can't be I've got to prove to lay in here if you want to talk about it or that they've proved that a woman can have a split over you know whatever you call it egg she can have enough fire with one man and not having a fire with her Hood when did we call it which would be intercourse there not in a fire and she can have children by two different men you say that's crazy science proves it right I don't have to argue I'm not arguing I'm preaching there was two kids the main thing I want to ask if I have time is how come Cain would be so robust about God to God in the face of God to say to God am I My Brother's Keeper when he'd already killed him where did that come from all right he said well brother Dale tell us flying okay in the garden Eve had an affair with a beast not a snake he was made of snake player and then that same day she had an affair with her husband our intercourse with her husband in there come Cain and Abel his twins read your Bible now if that's not true as I said again why would you make Leaves to cover themselves why would it come out to be in this day to understand human beings and why would Jesus Christ have to die to come through that wound to Die For You and I if the wound didn't have something to do with it hey we're adults I sit and talking to a lady in Jamaica one day explaining a few of these things to her turned around and looked at her I said look you're old enough to understand she was probably in her 50s I said you know what happened in the garden my daddy 45 years old before he married 13 kids later I come along I'm the baby of 13. I'm glad he saved the best of life my mom said One Day to my wife she said you know Sam's daddy told me one time he couldn't read she read the Bible and he asked her in life and said what do you think Hannah happened during the garden oh they ate an apple he said now that was her name Hannah he said now a hand he said I don't think that's exactly what it was he was 45 years old before he married an old Bachelor he knew a little bit about life all right that's not being derogatory or vulgaritas being truthful if you just sat down for a minute and think about it you know what happened in the garden you might not want to admit it because Cain didn't want to admit it you remember what Cain said over there I've offered My Sacrifice I believe it was fruit and God said if you'd offered it right I'd have accepted you brother Reynolds said if he had our done right he would have would have been accepted and said God went after him I've got these laying here he would have saved Cain if Cain had wanted to be saved that's brother Brown I'm getting people in the message argue and say that that's not true that's not go ahead I'm just trying to get into the scriptural point so what happened let's read real fast go ahead and pull it back up brother and let's read real fast you know what I believe I believe that they had on a fire in the garden and I'd like for you to explain to me what happened anything other than that you said that's not a vulgar thing no that's a beautiful situation because it explains why Jesus Christ had to come through a wound and it explains why Mary had to be a virgin come on see if we just ain't sensible a lot of the scripture starts opening up and a lot of the things get personal to us well I don't think we need to know what they've done well what was their own belief let's just deal with that and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes you know and a tree to be desired to make one wise so it had to be the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right she took of the fruit thereof and did he or put cook eat potato eat if you don't agree with that what about where Jesus said unless you eat my flesh is that scripture and drink my blood you have no part with me he wasn't talking about physically that's right he was talking about partaking right and the eyes of them both were open and they knew they were naked roll it up warm everybody can make sure and see it verse seven both were open and they knew they were naked if eaten apples will let people know they're naked I will personally Hawk everything I got to buy a few thousand dollars worth of apples and let you give them out right that's not joking apples give you bellyache but look what did they do the eyes of them both were open they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons covered their bodies right and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself watch it and he said who told thee that thou was naked right half thou eaten of the free wherever I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat what was that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil unbelief in God right but something else took place all right and the man said look at him back up four then talks about his wife look at him the man said the woman right blaming her right and the man said the woman thou gave us me gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat it's your fault so you gave me that woman you said that ain't what it said will you read it tell me what else to say he was passing the buck right right now look what she turns and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat Look up the word be God when you get home I don't think you need to you're old enough to have sense but God means to defile deceive trick right and the Lord God said unto the serpent who's he talking to remember serpent was the most subtle of all bees now he's turned to speak to the beast but he's really speaking not only upon that beast but he was speaking to the devil that was doing the talking that's why it's called a serpent watch him the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life a curse it was put on the Beast made him a snake put him on his belly cursed a beast now I ask you a simple question now this is serious to me whether it is to you or not but a simple question if it wasn't something connected with the animal in the form of enough fire and a beast you know remember the Beast was an upright creature if not so why was the animal made the atonement the Old Testament well when the apple tree made the atonement come on you said brother Dale you're just trying to get me to reason I'm trying to get you to have common sense whether it's called reason or what it is I'm just asking Bible questions simple why did the animal have to be made to sacrifice because the animal was used of Satan right to speak then it was made an atonement throughout the Old Testament why wasn't it made out of apple trees because Cain thought that's what it was and he brought come on he brought of the fruit of the land right and God rejected it Abel brought blood and God accepted it now go home and look this up the seed of man go look it up in your dictionary when you got home we're going to look it up in the Webster I mean the your internet you know the seed of man is highly congealed blood simple terminology just go look it up the seed of man is highly congeal blood the woman only produces an egg that's why the chicken you can lay all the eggs it won't do we didn't good unless it's been with a hint I mean a rooster right come on so what happened in the garden look he cursed the Beast but here's where we'll just have to stop because look God never left them in bad shape you think brother Dale you're just a doomsday preacher you just beat us down it looked like there's no hope for nothing I thought the Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free he didn't say to know about truth it said You shall know the truth the Bible said they that no they're God shall do exploits job said I know My Redeemer liveth do you know your Redeemer Lives you know that God can keep his word all right look right in the middle of the whole thing before we get down to the woman and you explain to me let's read this and I'll read it for us in a hurry unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply the eating of the apples and give you the stomach ache you're supposed to be reading the Bible what does it say unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception we're old enough to know in sorrow thy shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband remember Adam and Eve standing in the garden beautiful power standing there co-equal with each other but look what it where we at okay and he shall rule over thee the man's supposed to be ruler of the house right why because what she done in the garden that's not blaming her because he went out with her well let's go back to the scripture and we'll quit look what he puts right in there right when mankind has come up to where that he's cursed the Beast and he's speaking to the man he's telling him about how he'll have to to to uh work and toil he curses the Beast and makes it a snake he turns around the back to Adam and Eve and look what he says I will put enmity between thee and the woman who's he speaking to Satan serpent enmity means division the Bible says that the carnal mind is an enemity against God right I will put enmity between thee and the woman what and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel woman doesn't have a seed why would the bible say that the woman doesn't have a seed come on she has an egg doesn't have a seed that's the first promise of Jesus Christ written in the word of God all right between thy seed and her seed her seed all Bible scholars know to read it that's the first prophecy that Jesus Christ would come and die because Jesus Christ is the seed of the woman come on come on read your Bible he's the seed of the woman he come through the woman right a woman don't have no seed why would it say her seed her seed is Jesus Christ that was the promise that God would send the savior but if that be true then who is the other seed it's the seed of that Beast or the seed of that serpent the seed of that devil if you want to go back to your unbelief that is still right here with you and I today the seed of unbelief is still in all of us and that's where the trouble is at that's why we need a new birth and even with the new birth we need a whole lot more because the devil can still talk to us because that's what Paul said to the Corinthians he was writing to Christians in in Corinthians when he said let's you be tempted like Eve was beguiled by the serpent don't think this because we're Christians that we can go out and do wrong and get by with it right well it don't bother me maybe the reason it don't bother you because you're not born again in order bothers every day of what we do in life right but you see the seed of the serpent is still buzzing today right here to these heads that we are that seed of the serpent is still buzzing if you can't see what happened in the garden by reading the Bible we won't have time to get to it today but I want you to show me one thing I want somebody out there on the internet just going worldwide so I'm challenging the world to bring it not challenged but just tell you to bring it show me where Cain was ever listed in the lineage of Adam in the Bible it's not there Kane is not listed in the lineage of Adam Cain is not listed in the lineage of Jesus Christ Luke what is it three I believe that's right where's list the lineage and it comes down and it brings it down to Enos and us to say it was Enoch to Seth and coming down and it says to Adam which was the son of God Cain is nowhere in that lineage listed I want you to show it to me we read the Bible in Jude of course if you don't I can't remember exact verse but it's in the book of Jude which got only one chapter so you don't find it really easy it says in Job that Cain was of the wicked one why would he speak that way about Cain when he called him the wicked one who's the wicked one Satan unless you know what's in our dominance we're in the Bible he's a set of The Parables the sower went The Good Seed of the seed of the Kingdom but he said The Bad Seed is the seed of the wicked the Bible trying why can't we believe it man look oh we've never heard it maybe before but you heard it now he'll go home raise your Bible then come back let's talk about it I love to talk about the word of God it don't bother me if you come tell me I'm wrong haven't bothered me none whatsoever because if you're right I can be helped but if I'm right I ain't gonna worry about it I'm gonna be waiting on you to come tell me the truth why would it speak cocaine as it does in the Bible run in the ways of Cain right after the Arab Balaam what does it speak of Cain as it does but I want you to show me one lineage to Jude I believe it's in Austin John first John um Enoch the seventh from Adam read your Bible you put Cain in there Enoch is number eight read your Bible Enoch VII from Adam put Cain in in his eight of them so you're correct in the Bible go get your genealogies like I told you I'm not against people in their ways or thinking but there's a great group of people around the world that believe the tubala came is the seventh from Adam and they'll teach it to you in a hurry but that's on the wrong side of the lineage because you've got two lineages that started coming down but I want you to find me Cain in any lineage of Gods in the lineage of coming to Christ or the lineage coming from Adam as it says coming down because you get on over about the fifth chapter and it speaks of Adam and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and brought forth a son and called his name saith God's word is right let's stand I got about three minutes till 12 so let's just don't have anything and I'm sorry to be that long but I wanted to just cover these scriptures and get it in the right place that's all right musicians just let's just saying I love him anybody have a need we never want to leave without somebody you know if somebody has a need to be prayed for or whatever ah I love you why because judge my salary I have to have surgery okay for some lesions as on and from the circumcision they've done so let's just pray and believe that everything will be all right okay you believe it too because we believe right father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our little buddy here believing you that by your stripes he's healed and we thank you for it now we just committed
