[15:50] today everybody
[15:52] happy amen
[15:55] good when o
[15:59] so
[16:04] today I bring something on my
[16:08] heart each one of us come here to a
[16:12] fellowship and the word of
[16:16] God even the prophet of
[16:20] God taught us that in a
[16:23] fellowship each one has to be in one
[16:26] Accord and are we in one Accord
[16:30] because if we're not in one
[16:32] Accord you would not have come
[16:37] today and what I like about
[16:41] it is that there's several pastors here
[16:45] [Music]
[16:46] today and that among the pastors that
[16:49] are
[16:50] here including brother
[16:54] Samuel including each one that's here
[16:57] today
[17:01] none tries to overrule the
[17:06] other that's
[17:09] Fellowship remember that God sent us a
[17:13] prophet to take us out of the
[17:18] nism and in this last
[17:21] day the people have returned to
[17:27] nism there are pastors they want to
[17:29] dominate other
[17:33] pastors there are other pastors that
[17:34] want to take control of
[17:38] others and they see that they say they
[17:41] they see that in Malachi
[17:44] 4:5 but thank
[17:47] God that we have come out of
[17:51] them and we can't go
[17:53] back to
[17:56] nism because you came out
[18:00] keep walking
[18:02] Brethren that's why we do these types of
[18:07] services
[18:09] Fellowship one with
[18:13] another under only one
[18:17] guide and that's that is the holy
[18:23] spirit are we in
[18:26] agreement that's why it's an
[18:30] Fellowship under one guide shom Shalom

[40:16] church well there came a time brother
[40:19] Tony that the Lord got a hold of me and
[40:20] said you're wasting your your talent so
[40:24] I've been practicing and practicing and
[40:26] practicing and prac iing and still I
[40:28] ain't
[40:29] perfect but anyway I I hope you will

[40:52] and I have not a trace
[40:54] that I just appreciate him doing
[40:58] that and one other little thing I want
[41:00] to tell you you know sometimes God gives
[41:03] you a visitation in a way that you're
[41:04] not even you you never had that kind of
[41:07] thing
[41:08] before and I was getting a message
[41:10] brother JT puts up with me to speak on
[41:13] Sunday night sometimes and you know I
[41:16] was getting a message together and I
[41:18] couldn't make it work and I thought Lord
[41:19] I know you gave me this now why can't I
[41:22] get it to
[41:23] work so help me what happened was the
[41:27] Lord directed me said look at the
[41:29] scriptures just above where you're
[41:31] looking and when I did it fell right
[41:34] into place and I thought okay there's
[41:36] what I was missing you know I'm wrong A
[41:39] lot of times but he ain't never wrong
[41:41] amen so I'm hoping this will be a
[41:43] blessing to you the song is Holy Ground

[41:48] words up brother Homer because it said
[41:51] this is the temple no we are the temple

[1:06:49] so I ask God to give me inspiration to
[1:06:51] bring it to to Fellowship uh a thought
[1:06:54] to help just a unity and everything like
[1:06:57] that so that's what we was praying for
[1:06:59] so as we get ready to turn on read two
[1:07:02] places in the script I'm going to read

[1:07:33] chapter verse 25 it reads like this not

[1:07:43] another so much the more as we see the
[1:07:45] day approaching for if we sin Wily after
[1:07:49] we had we after that we have received
[1:07:52] the knowledge of the truth that remain
[1:07:55] of no
[1:07:56] sacrifice for sins I'm going to go to
[1:07:59] First

[1:08:04] verse start reading at verse five down
[1:08:09] through verse 8 and praise God it
[1:08:14] says this is the
[1:08:17] message which we have heard of him
[1:08:21] declared unto you that God is
[1:08:24] what and and in him is no Darkness at
[1:08:29] all if we say that we have fellowship
[1:08:32] with him and walk in darkness we lie
[1:08:35] right and do not the
[1:08:37] truth but if we walk in the light right
[1:08:42] and he is in the light we have
[1:08:43] Fellowship one with another yes and the
[1:08:46] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanse us
[1:08:50] from all sin yes if we say that we have
[1:08:56] no sin we deceive
[1:08:59] ourself and the truth is not in us let
[1:09:03] us prayer our gracious father help me
[1:09:07] one more time thankes to yeld my body my
[1:09:11] mind yes my spirit and my soul to you oh

[1:09:24] service in Jesus Christ name we pray
[1:09:26] amen amen God bless you you may be
[1:09:28] seated one
[1:09:30] moment I'm going to take my coat off
[1:09:32] brother Carl says you can't work and
[1:09:34] fight with a coat on he said when you
[1:09:36] preaching you're doing both so I'm going
[1:09:38] to take that off right now thank the
[1:09:40] Lord for the reading of the word of God
[1:09:42] this evening I like what they started
[1:09:44] off in the scripture here as we uh
[1:09:46] looked at the thought right here we find
[1:09:48] here that I read in the scripture here
[1:09:50] that if we should send with the after we
[1:09:52] have received the knowledge of the truth
[1:09:55] that remaining no more sacrifice for sin
[1:09:57] in other words God gift of knowledge is
[1:09:59] a profit for Edge H so then we find here
[1:10:03] at the the Bible brings us under
[1:10:05] Fellowship say if we walk in the light
[1:10:07] yeah and he is in the light we have
[1:10:10] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:10:12] blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all
[1:10:16] sins H that I want to be washed I want
[1:10:19] to be washed by the word I want to be
[1:10:21] cleaned by the word HJ so we begin here
[1:10:24] and I took a thought from there no light
[1:10:26] no blood Hall if you ain't got no light
[1:10:29] you ain't got no blood H because the
[1:10:31] Bible say we walk in the light and he is
[1:10:33] in the light then we have Fellowship one
[1:10:36] with another and the blood and the blood
[1:10:38] of his son Jesus Christ cleans us from
[1:10:41] all sins so I be to look at I took a
[1:10:44] thought from here and that way I'm not
[1:10:45] going to I'm going to kind of a
[1:10:47] different R I normally take it but we
[1:10:48] got to first off we got to have light
[1:10:51] order to be cleansed from our sins how
[1:10:54] we got to have in the the Book of
[1:10:55] Genesis one the first thing that God
[1:10:58] gave his creation was light let there be
[1:11:01] light how Adam walk in the light
[1:11:04] Hallelujah Adam you ain't got no sin
[1:11:06] just keep walking in the light
[1:11:07] Hallelujah so that would as long as Adam
[1:11:10] stayed in the light he was C that was
[1:11:13] nothing that was no Darkness at
[1:11:15] all and the next thing you know but what
[1:11:18] God required Adam to walk in the light
[1:11:21] it was just two things he required he
[1:11:23] required Adam to walk in the light and
[1:11:25] eat all he want Hallelujah eat from
[1:11:28] every tree of the garden but one tree H
[1:11:31] eat from every tree in the garden here h
[1:11:33] i just keep eating and just to keep stay
[1:11:35] in the light and keep
[1:11:37] eating as long as he stayed in the light
[1:11:40] and kept eating Hallelujah that was
[1:11:42] nothing that he was perfectly
[1:11:47] clean that's all he needed to do God Rec
[1:11:49] commanded him told him to say to stay in
[1:11:52] the light long as Adam walked in the
[1:11:54] light Hallelujah d other word and long
[1:11:56] as Adam his mate was in the light hallel
[1:11:58] they were perfectly one with each other
[1:12:00] Hallelujah other word she did not get a
[1:12:03] to receive a new name until she uh got
[1:12:06] out of the L how her name was Adam she
[1:12:10] was his Revelation how she was the
[1:12:12] mystery of Adam reveal but when she left
[1:12:15] the light that when she received the
[1:12:16] name the mother of e the mother the
[1:12:20] mother of all living H she received what
[1:12:24] any what she brought the human R in the
[1:12:26] power of
[1:12:27] Darkness but we realize we beginning to
[1:12:30] here I think about this thing here as I
[1:12:32] begin to think on the thing so now other
[1:12:34] words so now when Adam did this he he
[1:12:36] would to stay with the light Genesis 1:3
[1:12:39] he should have stayed in the light
[1:12:41] Genesis 2 and verse 16 all he had to do
[1:12:43] is eat H that what all that what the
[1:12:46] word required her to do and walk in the
[1:12:48] light and eat the word how walk in the
[1:12:51] light and eat the word hallu that's what
[1:12:53] the word this is what this message come
[1:12:55] for H didn't come here for us to look at
[1:12:57] it they come here for us to eat it h you
[1:13:00] don't get fooled by looking at the book
[1:13:02] you got to eat the book you got to eat
[1:13:05] the Revelation yes sir we begin to
[1:13:07] realize here but I want you to notice
[1:13:09] here so when Adam Veil and he left the
[1:13:13] light he broke the fellowship with God
[1:13:16] how do he broke his fellowship with God
[1:13:18] how do no longer could God how God could
[1:13:21] walk down and talk with Adam because
[1:13:23] here he was he was in that great real a
[1:13:25] light and him and God could come
[1:13:27] together to light to meet and they could
[1:13:29] talk personally lift
[1:13:31] the but when Adam fell and moved from
[1:13:35] the light other words he didn't he
[1:13:38] didn't need nothing everything was just
[1:13:40] perfect everything was eternal
[1:13:41] Hallelujah here he was everything was in
[1:13:43] unity right there all fellowship with
[1:13:45] God and man they can Fellowship together
[1:13:48] Hallelujah that was nothing bro but when
[1:13:50] Adam fell no longer do he need no longer
[1:13:53] get no longer do he need light no do he
[1:13:55] need to heat what he need to redeem him
[1:13:58] is blood hallel now once he fa he need
[1:14:02] blood hallelu know what the only thing
[1:14:04] can take away your sin is the blood of
[1:14:07] Jesus Christ
[1:14:09] hallelujah what he did is to restore his
[1:14:12] Fellowship back God had to now God had
[1:14:15] to go and get blood he needed blood his
[1:14:17] way back God just speak now God was not
[1:14:20] talking like he was God was not speaking
[1:14:22] lip ear to him no more but God was
[1:14:24] speaking by the revelation of the blood
[1:14:27] H without the shedding of blood there's
[1:14:29] no remission of sin I don't care how
[1:14:31] holy you've been I don't care if you've
[1:14:32] been raised in the me you got to come
[1:14:34] through the blood you got to be saved by
[1:14:37] the
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:40] blood is here now we go here we find
[1:14:42] here here he was here he was here go
[1:14:45] here that God go down and he slay a lamb
[1:14:49] and he clothe Adam with blood howu Adam
[1:14:51] was clothed with blood huah God see the
[1:14:54] blood H the Judgment passed over here
[1:14:57] hallel the Revelation became the blood
[1:14:59] hallelu now and the word but he had to
[1:15:02] still eat how you still got to eat you
[1:15:05] can have the blood but you still got to
[1:15:07] eat the word how the word is the blood
[1:15:09] that bleed for you H the prophet of God
[1:15:12] said any how are we going to stay
[1:15:14] sinless how can we be such a sinly he's
[1:15:17] the ever born again person everyone that
[1:15:20] confess their sin in the blood of Jesus
[1:15:22] Christ is totally sinless
[1:15:25] the word bleed for you the word bleed
[1:15:29] for you church and I begin to look here
[1:15:32] so so I'm not I ain't got this program
[1:15:35] I'm just preaching my inspiration so so
[1:15:39] now we realize here if Adam broke the
[1:15:43] fellowship and walked out of the
[1:15:45] light walked from the way that God had
[1:15:48] written order for God to restore the
[1:15:50] fellowship back we got to come back to
[1:15:53] the light we got to come come back to
[1:15:55] the word to eat it and we got to have
[1:15:57] blood so God started the plan had God
[1:16:00] begin to start the way back H so we find
[1:16:03] here here go
[1:16:05] Abraham when God left there here go
[1:16:08] Abraham there God came to Abraham told
[1:16:12] Abraham to get up from his his kind and
[1:16:15] and go to a land he ass show him here go
[1:16:17] Abraham Abraham to walk with the light
[1:16:20] Hallelujah other words God brought light
[1:16:21] to Abraham here he was a man that was in
[1:16:24] a heathen
[1:16:25] a man that was under Heathen God but
[1:16:27] when the light came how he expose the
[1:16:31] power of Darkness it broke the power
[1:16:33] demon power and Loos
[1:16:36] Abraham and Abraham begin to walk with
[1:16:38] God hallelujah then we begin to realize
[1:16:41] here and we begin to look at the story
[1:16:43] here just kind of paraphrase it through
[1:16:45] some many things but here he is Abraham
[1:16:47] get old didn't have no inheritance right
[1:16:51] Hallelujah word his body didn't have a
[1:16:53] anywh he did produce a son
[1:16:55] Hallelujah he did produce a son called
[1:16:58] ishma hallelu but Abraham did produce a
[1:17:01] son called ishma but if we look at the
[1:17:04] scripture Abraham never had
[1:17:06] ishmail Abram had ishmail how Abraham
[1:17:10] received the revelation God never give
[1:17:14] required Abraham to identify himself
[1:17:16] with that son right there he said offer
[1:17:18] your only begotten son Isaac what
[1:17:21] happened to Israel Israel was his old
[1:17:23] book
[1:17:25] your old book when you come to the word
[1:17:27] of God your old book is done away with
[1:17:30] God see your new
[1:17:32] name beginning Hall he saw he saw
[1:17:36] Abraham he bringing Abraham back in
[1:17:37] fellowship with him again how bringing
[1:17:40] AB Abraham back in fellowship with the
[1:17:42] word again here go Abraham here go
[1:17:44] Abraham you're going to receive that son
[1:17:46] Hallelujah here go God appeared to
[1:17:48] Abraham how he begin to reveal the
[1:17:50] Revelation to Abraham then God came down
[1:17:52] in a human
[1:17:53] body EXA God came down in a human body
[1:17:58] the light stepped in skin how it goes
[1:18:01] down to Abraham and he look tell Abraham
[1:18:05] you going to have a son you going Sarah
[1:18:08] when it when but the the problem was
[1:18:11] they were too old to have that son
[1:18:14] Hallelujah that was too old to have that
[1:18:15] son Hall the body Abraham body was dead
[1:18:19] Sarah body was dead how could that dead
[1:18:22] body have that son that light struck
[1:18:25] that body how when light said let there
[1:18:28] be light that same voice say you going
[1:18:31] to have a son that body had to give away
[1:18:34] to the power of God Hall then we realize
[1:18:37] here Abraham in and another way in his
[1:18:39] old age had this son Hall when signs say
[1:18:44] it can't happen but when God speak
[1:18:48] Hallelujah I don't care how long it been
[1:18:49] laying there if God speak you going to
[1:18:50] have that son you going to have that son
[1:18:53] so Abraham produced that son Hallelujah
[1:18:55] now here go here go Abraham here here go
[1:18:58] Abraham after he have this son God then
[1:19:00] God turned around and say Abraham offer
[1:19:02] this
[1:19:04] son that was a great test brother homie
[1:19:07] you talking about a great test that what
[1:19:09] you I'm talking about God required him
[1:19:10] to give something up that he done waited
[1:19:13] all them years to have and now he done
[1:19:15] got there the p a d body was restored
[1:19:18] back how W was restored by now God say
[1:19:20] offer this son it was the hardest test
[1:19:23] that Abraham ever had how Abraham when a
[1:19:26] brother died himself didn't let had to
[1:19:29] kill his own son but Abraham woke up
[1:19:32] early in the morning before Sarah got
[1:19:34] out of the bed I say he better done that
[1:19:37] cuz there been the biggest fight he ever
[1:19:39] seen you not killing her son that been
[1:19:42] out of the question Hallelujah let word
[1:19:44] you know ain't no woman in you do that
[1:19:46] you might get this Revelation you better

[1:19:50] going to be a fight there you going to
[1:19:51] have to kill two people that day here we
[1:19:53] are but Abraham get up
[1:19:56] Abraham get up and he started to walk
[1:19:58] with God hallelujah he started to walk
[1:20:00] in the light H he was not just walking
[1:20:03] he walked in the
[1:20:05] light and that light would lead
[1:20:08] him to the r where he going to so what
[1:20:11] did Abraham do he go get a couple of
[1:20:13] deacons he said come on deacons let's go
[1:20:15] here all right me and the L going to go
[1:20:17] young and worship and we going to return
[1:20:21] how how did he know that he didn't have
[1:20:22] no feelings he didn't have no sensation
[1:20:24] that they going to return but by faith
[1:20:27] that same holy ghost that told him he
[1:20:30] going to have a child but the same holy
[1:20:32] ghost on the inside of Abraham speaking
[1:20:34] the word we we'll go young and worship
[1:20:37] and we'll return HJ so they we know the
[1:20:40] story how they begin to go up here on
[1:20:43] the mountain here in other words they
[1:20:45] they get near the mountain Mount of
[1:20:47] Mariah Abraham at the mountain here and

[1:20:53] so a looking at his father he got
[1:20:54] everything but he got something missing
[1:20:57] the lamb is missing so I better say
[1:20:59] something here we going to how we going
[1:21:01] to offer a sacrifice we didn't even
[1:21:02] bring we didn't even bring a lamb to
[1:21:04] sacrifice so as said I better remind my

[1:21:20] power where is the sacrifice hallah but
[1:21:23] we need somebody
[1:21:25] that had the power of God H in your
[1:21:27] mouth if you say to this mou and beov
[1:21:31] not doubt of your heart you can have
[1:21:33] whatever you say that power is on the
[1:21:35] inside of you you got to realize speak
[1:21:37] the word Bri it will take the word to
[1:21:41] change
[1:21:42] you what did Abraham say Abraham looked
[1:21:45] in that Dimension how with under
[1:21:47] inspiration or Revelation Abraham said
[1:21:51] God will provide himself
[1:21:54] saice do you realize what did he do he
[1:21:57] released the lust the word that was on
[1:22:00] the inside of him God cl to create a
[1:22:06] ram that realm had to be
[1:22:09] created because that Ram was not just an
[1:22:11] ordinary Ram right it had to type Christ
[1:22:15] that Ram had to be the very type of St
[1:22:17] John 3:16 God so loved the world he gave
[1:22:20] his only begotten son and whosoever
[1:22:23] believe in him how did that real had to
[1:22:24] be the type of Christ it was just not
[1:22:27] any real he spoke a real and that real
[1:22:29] was not like any other real that's
[1:22:32] right I said that real was not like any
[1:22:35] other real it's what made that realm
[1:22:37] different that what made that Ram
[1:22:39] different that that realm did not have a
[1:22:41] father that realm did not have a mother
[1:22:44] it was created Power that real did not
[1:22:47] have a father mother that Christ on the
[1:22:50] earth Christ had legal right to come
[1:22:55] H the light so I'm not going to take
[1:22:58] here I'm not going to try to bring all
[1:23:00] this out today but I want you to notice
[1:23:02] here God was going to use that way to

[1:34:55] couldn't get a new birth without coming
[1:34:57] to the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:34:59] because he was the lamb that was slain
[1:35:01] he was a sacrifice that was K they had
[1:35:02] to die for the sins of the world he had
[1:35:04] to identify himself with blood
[1:35:07] Hallelujah he said Lord he said Lord he

[1:35:14] Lord he said I am Jesus the word Jesus
[1:35:17] was spoken and Demon power let go

[1:35:37] confess that he is Lord and he's still
[1:35:42] Lord oh Hallelujah I want you to notice
[1:35:46] this
[1:35:46] real but we need to eat we got Jesus I'm
[1:35:51] just going close kind of hit this then
[1:35:53] before we prise you here we are Jesus
[1:35:56] clo Jesus had to bring that same type
[1:36:00] that they had in the book of The Book of
[1:36:02] Exodus they had to have light they had
[1:36:06] to eat and they had to have blood so
[1:36:09] here when Jesus come on the scene
[1:36:12] hallelujah what if he claim himself I am
[1:36:14] the light of the world I am the light of
[1:36:17] the world Hallelujah any word he
[1:36:20] realized I am the light of the world if
[1:36:23] you in Darkness come to
[1:36:25] me then not only did he require you the
[1:36:28] light of the world he said eat me eat my
[1:36:31] flesh and drink my blood how he was the
[1:36:33] sa of he made the
[1:36:37] word and he was the one that shed the
[1:36:40] blood so he had to bring the same
[1:36:43] type to bring us back in fellowship with
[1:36:46] God we needed all three things to happen
[1:36:49] because we was in bondage H we need the
[1:36:52] light of the world to come where there
[1:36:54] no dead care in other words Jesus was
[1:36:56] such a he was so much charged with the
[1:36:58] light charged with the light of God he
[1:37:00] couldn't even go to a funeral
[1:37:03] service because Darkness and Light can't
[1:37:06] come
[1:37:08] together that why he had to let lar die
[1:37:11] before he show up because he would have
[1:37:14] come the second day it would have been
[1:37:16] it would have been
[1:37:17] over so since the Jews had a
[1:37:20] tradition they believe that the spirit
[1:37:22] hanging around three days
[1:37:24] he said I better wait the fourth
[1:37:26] day cuz I don't want them to base their
[1:37:28] Revelation on Traditions had a
[1:37:31] revelation of the Resurrection is not a
[1:37:33] truition is a real person so Jesus
[1:37:35] waited for about we waited for 4 days
[1:37:39] then he showed up now Elijah's been in
[1:37:42] the grave that Dead stick was laying ear
[1:37:46] laying behind the Tabernacle there no
[1:37:48] life in it at all but when the Chic of
[1:37:50] Glory come life come back in it so that
[1:37:53] should count Glory this time walking in
[1:37:55] SK hallelu walking down there walking
[1:37:58] down to the walking down to the tomb

[1:38:02] you would have been
[1:38:03] here if you would have been here my
[1:38:07] brother would not have died Jesus be to
[1:38:10] talk a little bit and and then Jesus
[1:38:14] then she said if you would have been
[1:38:15] here my brother would not di didn't not

[1:38:47] by this time so now she trying to put a
[1:38:49] circumstance why he can't raised he
[1:38:51] don't care if he was stanking buds C
[1:38:53] whatever is he was the resurrection so

[1:44:25] going through everything that you don't
[1:44:27] went through right now yes sir amen it
[1:44:29] went through everything right it was so
[1:44:33] deformed that God closed the heavens
[1:44:36] couldn't look at his own son he stood
[1:44:39] there as a man but on the inside of him
[1:44:41] was the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:44:44] he stood there and as he was standing
[1:44:46] there they took two low down theves yes
[1:44:49] sir to humiliated him the humiliated him
[1:44:54] yeah he was them two theves on the cross
[1:44:57] ain't done nothing but a thief is a
[1:44:59] thief
[1:45:02] people I
[1:45:05] know well I tell you what I tell you I
[1:45:08] used to go in place with my cousins and
[1:45:10] them guy was so good man you walk out of
[1:45:12] the store you said did y'all get
[1:45:13] something they have a whole lot of
[1:45:16] stuff I said man I didn't see you get
[1:45:18] that they said well that was a thief you
[1:45:20] don't F to see it I said them J was like
[1:45:22] Med
[1:45:23] but here we
[1:45:26] are that's the thing and they holding
[1:45:29] Jesus beside two peoples was not worth
[1:45:34] nothing I'm sure where the bloody that's
[1:45:37] where we stood without Christ we was no
[1:45:41] different from them two theves without
[1:45:43] the blood shed it we was no different
[1:45:45] from we were always by by Nature we were
[1:45:48] children the Wrath walking out the power
[1:45:51] of our own imagination
[1:45:54] but God who is rich in Mercy he stood
[1:45:57] down on the
[1:45:58] cross between two
[1:46:00] thiefs and blood running down blood just
[1:46:04] dripping down his body and all of a
[1:46:07] sudden Jesus is dying he's he's about
[1:46:09] ready to yield himself they couldn't
[1:46:11] take his life they never took his life
[1:46:15] he already declared no man take my life
[1:46:17] I'll raise it I lay it down and I raise
[1:46:19] it up ain't nobody ever made that nobody
[1:46:23] never said that before that can make it
[1:46:24] happen that's right but Jesus knew it
[1:46:26] was because he knew who he was he knew I
[1:46:28] am the resurrection how so he and where
[1:46:31] he's standing and he's bleeding and he's
[1:46:33] and he and he and he's gasping all he
[1:46:36] got to do is say Lord I commit my spirit
[1:46:38] in your hand his Spirit would have left
[1:46:39] his body that's the only way it could
[1:46:41] happen and Jesus don't and now the two
[1:46:43] thev is on the cross there's a conflict
[1:46:46] start right broke a
[1:46:49] fellowship that one Thief turned around
[1:46:51] and looked over there he say
[1:46:53] if you be God come off the cross and
[1:46:55] save yourself and save us that's right
[1:46:58] if he would have come off the cross we
[1:47:00] all would have went to
[1:47:02] hell because only thing that could take
[1:47:04] away our sin stain was the blood
[1:47:06] Hallelujah Jesus had to stay on the
[1:47:08] cross and this other th says to him man
[1:47:12] you don't fear God wait a minute what
[1:47:16] did it matter if he fear him or not
[1:47:17] y'all two getting ready to go to hell
[1:47:19] the devil wouldn't even worry about them
[1:47:21] H the devil probably told us demons
[1:47:23] y'all concentrate on Jesus how don't
[1:47:25] worry about them to their minds Hall
[1:47:27] their mind and know no doubt they
[1:47:29] thought he probably here you know he
[1:47:31] knew he had them they were th he knew in
[1:47:32] a few minutes they'll be coming in the
[1:47:34] hell way I w't let you know something
[1:47:36] here but they didn't know what God had
[1:47:38] in his
[1:47:39] mind they didn't know the mind of
[1:47:42] God so this thief as they talking the
[1:47:45] thief look at Jesus Oh My and he says
[1:47:48] these
[1:47:50] words he didn't do nothing he wouldn't
[1:47:52] going to church he didn't pay ties if he
[1:47:53] did he stole it in other words
[1:47:55] [Laughter]
[1:47:57] in I mean so you know he wasn't doing
[1:48:00] nothing religious for God at all neither
[1:48:02] would you before you met God we were
[1:48:04] cuss and we might not sto we cuss and
[1:48:06] did everything there committed all kind
[1:48:08] of unclean act and everything we needed
[1:48:10] the blood of Jesus Christ you said but I
[1:48:12] was in church how you might have been in
[1:48:13] church but that don't mean you were
[1:48:14] saved we got a lot of demons that go to
[1:48:17] church they never get the Holy Ghost you
[1:48:19] just going to church one thing bring
[1:48:21] your body to church another thing to
[1:48:23] bring your heart to
[1:48:27] church this is it so he's standing there
[1:48:31] so this th he begin to
[1:48:34] recognize I need Jesus wonder what made
[1:48:39] that Thief
[1:48:41] recognized he need
[1:48:43] Jesus he was a thief he was going to
[1:48:47] hell but he
[1:48:49] recognized I need Jesus amen I
[1:48:52] recognized my
[1:48:55] atonement I hadn't done nothing to
[1:48:57] deserve this and all he
[1:49:01] said
[1:49:03] father when you come into your
[1:49:06] kingdom would you remember
[1:49:09] me remember mean to bring back something

[1:49:14] back something in your mind before the
[1:49:17] in word the devil thought he had him but

[1:49:50] Resurrection so Jesus said there he
