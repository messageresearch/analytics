amen the words what's true nothing else man's ideas and our ideas nothing's true except god's word that's kind of what we're going to speak on today we're on the two spirits so we're going to speak on today part 14 what is truth because you've got your two spirits in the framework of the church one's true and one's false there's no tweener as we say there's no in between there's there's truth as as the bible tells us and as the prophet tells us and even jesus says i am the way the truth and we'll read that in just a second so let's go to first john 4. uh remember that remember brother bob he's kind of in a stressful way there at work and may the lord bless him and give them i think they're about over it but give them wisdom to deal with what he's dealing with at work so also right after the service remember i'll try to announce it again to see brother terrence at the back door to get your gift from the church but now all other gifts and all other songs and all other skits are going to be done at the barn so everybody know where it's at if you don't if you go out here right there where the prayer request list is there is a map it's really easy go to guildsville look over to post office going up a little further you'll see a road veer off to the left take the first paved driveway on the left there's one little bitty one that shoots off with a red gate but you go to the next one and turn left it's well i mean it's got pavement stuff on it it's kind of that asphalt looking pavement with gravel but anyway you turn to the left right there now look there's two that goes one goes like this take the immediate left all right then and you'll go back by the time you get about 200 feet in you'll almost see it but it's way back in the woods there so don't think you're getting lost and don't think we've sent you on a wild goose chase but that's where we need to do all that down there at the barn and please wear your mask if possible while you're talking i know you can't while you're eating but while you're talking please wear your mouth and please try to stay six feet apart except for family okay so just remember that we'll have hand sanitizer and all the goodies down there for you to uh to practice that and we still want to practice that until until uh let's see uh brother dale will be preaching next this coming wednesday i got schedule here for the rest of the month and then i'll be doing the next sunday the 20th brother dale will be doing the wednesday on the 23rd i'll be doing the 27th there'll be no service on the 30th that week it'll be on thursday and it will be the 31st all right brother william borlavon will be here with us but sister monica's brother he's been here before several times and that will start at eight o'clock and we'll go from eight to midnight so get you some songs ready testimony whatever you wanna do because we're gonna let brother william preach and then we're gonna sing and testify until midnight and then take communion and then most people are off the next day for the they always say they always say what you do in the first of the year is what you do all year well you take the first day off never thought about that but then on the third we are going to start back terence will announce it later on but we'll be starting back with two services gonna try that on the third which would be brother dale and myself give these other guys some time off so because they've been they've been on the plow for a while and we really enjoyed them really enjoyed all of them amen love the ministry here they do a really good job bringing the word of god so uh thank you for your prayers we came back we went hunting we didn't go killing so we went hunting so but we had a good time everybody in kentucky really enjoyed seeing us and we enjoyed seeing them they're dealing with the coveted thing too but they're still having church um so we just want to keep them in our prayers and make sure that we make sure we remember all the pastors around the country that are dealing with this and all the churches and that the lord will give us all wisdom in what to do amen because if we don't forget trust in the lord we can't trust in nothing else so we put all of our trust in the lord so let's bow our heads we're going to go to first john but then we'll go to john 18. this is talking to pilate so let's bow our heads do you heavenly father thank you should give us forgive us of our sin many mistakes that we make lord contrary to your word because we're being human lord we just were born contrary but lord you gave us the baptism of the holy ghost to turn everything back around and send it back in the right direction and that's what you're looking at today lord and we're looking at the atonement not what we did wrong we're looking at the atonement lord that we know that you died at calvary 2000 years ago and even this time of the year we're celebrating as the world does the your birth lord but if it hadn't been for calvary you died for us lord you knew that you knew you had to do it and you did it you did it willingly to save our soul and to make this thing come back right thank you for that lord remember us in this season that we will be joyful and everything will be wonderful father and you'll take care of all of us keep us all healthy be with the bride around the world lord take care of them lord you minister today father and just move this vessel out of the way and you take over in jesus name we pray amen all right so let's get the calendar and leave it right there i guess all right here we go beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know we the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god now listen it's like i told you before you can confess that jesus christ is god and and be an alcoholic or be a drunk and be a whoremonger and everything else but you got to really when you confess you know that that man lived 2 thousand years ago but he's now in your flesh and man jesus christ now is in you in your flesh and that's what we confess because most of the world thinks he's the second person of the trinity which is totally false no such thing as that amen we knew he was almighty god no more no less amen hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses to jesus christ come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world 2 000 years ago year of god little children have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world here at them in other words the daily conversation of the world they they get together and they talk about this and that and the other and then you get together and talk about the word of god and how god's been good and they'll they'll agree with you that far but when you start going into the major doctrines and you start reading the bible to them and you start talking to them about one god water baptism no eternal hell and all they that's when the conversation ends they might be there in body but they're not there in spirit because they're not paying attention to anything you're saying after that all right we are of god he that knoweth god here with us he that is not of god here if not us hereby know we now look here's where i got the thought from hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error that separation there you may be seeing let's read john 18 as you're seated john 18 37 pilate therefore said unto him king then jesus says that i am a king to this end i was born and for this cause i came into the world that i should bear witness unto the what truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice what was pilate's problem he was not of the truth what was the jews problem that put jesus on the cross they were not of the truth but pilate says unto him what is truth he was confused he didn't have the truth there was the no truth was found in him so now let's read john 14 6 jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so there's no other way you say oh now i don't know about truth i don't know who's got truth that listen if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul today you have truth amen you have the truth not a truth there's a lot of truths but there's not the truth the truth is that bible and what jesus christ said right and then and then we know one thing people you know get all convoluted and worried about the this and that the other going on about us believing that god sent a prophet but look at that confusion out in the world look at all the confusion out in the world if jesus stood up one day and said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life and the bible says in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us then that must have been the truth but what was he he was the word right glory so what is truth if we would have been standing there went during pilate's time and we know what we know now we'd go that's true point to jesus that's true that's right that's the truth right there but we weren't standing there wasn't our time right so brother brown says in the extra position of the seven church ages we good okay i don't my own son says don't know if we're good or not okay now remember this christ in the true church see i got that under the line there is a true remember i'm going to read this quote stand right there real quick they don't have it in the back keep it right there though brother brown said in the rising of the sun he says there has been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides but there has got to come one there's not two brides you don't take two women now maybe some people do if they believe in polygamy but they're you're only supposed to have one wife right right brother dale and i were listening to marriage and divorce coming back from um hunting the other day i kind of wanted to listen to that again and and you know brother brown hits on that he said christ can't have i mean christ can have multiple wives because the man can have i understand what i mean but remember that bride can't have but one husband but if you take on a different doctrine or that error that we're talking about you're actually worshiping satan thinking you're going home with another husband right right how horrible is that but that's the truth that's why marriage in divorce is hard it doesn't work i think it's dude well they picked the time to die okay well we might have to get another one then i'm not gonna move around at least maybe it starts speaking spanish or something i don't know maybe everything's hung on spanish never forget joe canada did that one day joseph me and timbo was getting in the truck we were getting ready to go do some cut some yards and stuff and back when we were doing that property preservation and uh we get in the car and crank the thing up and turn on the uh turn on the the gps and they go now i know i'm not wearing i got one and i'm not making fun but joseph had got in there and changed it to chinese the language so anyway it took us about thank goodness that we had about an hour to travel and timbo was over there you remember that tim where are you at out there okay he's sitting over there trying to get it back to so anyway yeah joe canada did that yes he did did that to us while he was working bless his heart i'll get him back one of these days so christ in the true church so like i said before there has to be a true right there can't be 900 different points or denominations or you tell me why there's a methodist on this side of the town and another method that's on this side of the town and they're only about two miles apart then you've got message churches that's not even that far apart and they won't even fellowship with each other what are we going to do in heaven i asked the baptist that one time he never answered me i said you say you got truth he said yep i said what about the methodists you're saying they don't have truth you look at me and you say i don't have truth because there's only one truth i am the way the truth and the life right there's only one truth everything else is false i said so what we're going to do in heaven i said what are you going to do with the methodist when you get up there what are you going to do with me when you get up here you all go it's just going to be all baptist and he never would answer me because see if you nail him down why are you a message believer why are you a baptist or a presbyterian or a methodist because you think they're right that's right right god can't be that confused he's not that confused that's why god had to send a prophet straight from the he became the mouthpiece of god he was not god he was a sinner saved by grace just like me and you amen he was not god but he's got the same god in you the same god that's in you was in him so then you need to respond to that that's what i was telling them we're talking about in kentucky if you don't if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have to respond you have nothing to respond with right you can say william branham was false and he did this and he'd all the dates and yada yada but if you've got the holy ghost and i've got the holy ghost we can't respond different to that right that's why jesus was standing there at pilate's hall and and you know even pot you know why pilate said what is truth you know why he said that because jesus said everyone that is of the truth hear my voice here's my voice and he's standing there by himself right right that's right jesus was standing there by himself pilate knew he was not a threat to his earthly kingdom pilate knew that so then he's like well if you're this in other words this is what he's saying if you're if you've got this great kingdom and everyone that hears the truth well follow me where's your followers and then he walks out and tells the jews later on in that in that um part there he walks out and he says i find no fault with him what he was he was no threat pilate just didn't know he was the greatest threat he had ever stood in front of but it was hidden inside of human flesh just like me and you hidden inside that's where the true church is it's not a building it's not a name it's god in your flesh amen amen god residing in your tabernacle all right so christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts right now remember the quote i told you there has to come a real bride right glory there is one on the earth if there's not one on the earth the only time there won't be a true bride on the earth is when we leave this place amen that's when there will not be a true gentile bride but now what does he do he goes to israel but remember he had to divorce them so they won't be bribed right they'll be remnant they'll be 144 000 because of the promise that god made in his word he can't go away from that so he has to go he said never will i forget israel well all these thousands of years you read remember in the bible we read it with zechariah where they'll look upon him and see the scars in his hand and he'll say where'd you get those scars he said in the house of my friends not my bride my friends so he goes over there to that 144 000 because remember as we were talking last sunday he's not in listen the the foolish virgin does not have the truth right inside of them they have a truth if you have a truth you're not going in a rapture you've got to have the truth which is the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul not anointing you but in your soul so let's read this now but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and polish so we know it's coming we know it's already here we know what hap started 2 000 years ago right so let's go back let's go down to the red he knows that if the people get the what true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for so listen you can't be a true church and not do what the word says because the word is the marker the truth i'm getting some rebound up here josh is that it's just happening it's just going to happen okay that's all right i can deal with it and what she stands for and that she can do the greater words now we look today and we think you know i was thinking this morning we about brother ray and all the different ones we thought man lord where are you but he's in all this don't ever forget whatever is going on he's got his eternal immortal hand in it and he being infinite whatever is happening if it's happening to the bride it's for our good right amen glory and light brother tara said he you know i know brother ray is in a better place there's no virus going on over there but sister rita we're still calling time and we need to pray for her and and i want to announce this they have a gofundme account so if you want to send some money she may need it okay i'm just saying um he's been in the hospital for 20 something days so i'm sure after the grief happens she'll have more grief for those hospital bills because that's what we get we live in the world this world but look if people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a white true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church because remember now as i was telling you in isaiah 3 25 a.d that those doctrines listen those doctrines deceive the whole world oh yeah right 99 if there was a billion people 99 999 999 999 billion of them or million toward the billion were deceived there was only like one percent on the earth right that's why if you see your church age where in colombia right in here it almost goes dark they call it the dark ages have you ever noticed that while i've been preaching this have you ever not looked at your church calendar and go well there's the true and there's the false because the black is the false and the white is the true well god separated them in every church age every church age had the truth that's right but they didn't have all the truth as we were talking about in kentucky they didn't get all the way out luther had the truth ma uh martin all the different ones they had the truth but they didn't have all right right the truth luther is the just shall live by faith now god wasn't in the water baptism in the name of father son holy ghost he wasn't in all that stuff that luther wanted to bring out of the catholic church god wasn't in that that's why god had to bring somebody here a mouthpiece in this end time to straighten all that up why did brother brown talk about we were look well mare's in divorce he said you've got into this condition by what misinterpreted theology where did it come from where is misinterpreted theology right here behind this pulpit right amen some preacher has told you it's okay to divorce your wife or divorce your husband and marry anybody you wanted to know that's not the bible we know that right amen but now because of misinterpreted theology god had to give a grace of marriage and divorce to moses he had to give a grace there with paul and now he had to give a grace to brother brown because right there at the end i love what he said he said this is to my people only go on as you are what was he doing he was wiping their slate clean if they would believe it if they would believe it right he said but don't you ever do it again so if you did it again you come right out from under that grace a marriage in divorce all right so i'm not going to get into marriage and divorce because today's a happy day we're going to keep that happy but look we got to know what the two spirits are right there's several you're saying in the building's got living husbands and living wives uh-oh but have you accepted the grace of marriage and divorce to take care of that because remember it's not a it's not an issue of salvation don't ever let me just add this to you it's not it's not a salvation issue the bible says believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved but it does take you away from some of the promises that god give you because god can't give you the bible that says you can't do this and then give you all the promises not going to happen right all right remember because there's no in between it's either the truth but god had to send us a prophet to what take us from the faults back to the truth amen all right because he said from this point forward don't you ever do it again what a wonderful grace of marriage endorse but you know what that's what god did when he saved you he taught everything you did i don't care paul says in corinthians he said some of you were revilers whoremongers adulterers yadda yadda all the way down the line he said but you've been watched he said oh foolish galatians you know i was reading the corinthians the other day he went to car rent three times they needed some help he went to car in three times a wrote first corinthians second corinthians and then he was there another year if you'll read in there he'll you'll see where he said i've been i've come to you three times why they needed help but you know what they it cleaned that church up that's what we want we were all born dirty what about somebody with something mentioned the other day about pat tyler you know he was a gangster he killed people he was a murderer right yeah but brother brown said he was a holy ghost film man went out preaching and you said hey it doesn't matter if you just smoke cigarettes it doesn't matter if you just did xyz it's all one sin one sin which is unbelief all right so let's just keep that in our in our mind and not uh that's why we the bible tells us not to judge let the bible judge let the bible do that for us but now that's our that's our sounding board that's our truth so you got to go back to it so by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her now we're going to read the next position of the church age number two did you get it now these are the two twins again there are those two trees growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain benefiting by the same sun but they come from different seeds now look one tree is for the word of god right there's your true and now one seed and loves it and obeys it the other tree is from the sea that is anti the word and look changes it where it wants to now that's exactly what happened at nasa they changed the original truth of the bible and man just fell for it why because without the baptism of the holy ghost you'll fall right for anything right yeah amen because you have no type post you have no guide to say what does the word say how many times like i said before have you been sitting in a church service and you listen to a preacher preaching and you go you feel that little bump and you go man that ain't right and it wasn't right if you got the baptism the holy ghost that's what you need to depend on and now you can have a little bump and say i have a question and go ask the question but when it's blatantly against even the word of god i hate it but people in this message have changed the word of god they've done the same thing these people in the denominations have done right made it cold formal and powerless but they got signs and wonders i i got a quote right over here signs and wonders the real bride i'll read it later i can't find it now but she'll not go after all that because signs follow the believer signs follow the word of god and then let's look at the word deceived deceived is to cause to accept that's true or valid what is false or invalid jesus was standing there he said i am the way the truth and the life i am the truth and pilate said i just really don't see that i see you a good man and you got some followers but they're not outside threatening my kingdom actually the people that you're dealing with are wanting to kill you because he was the jews that was wanting him dead i don't think the romans cared the gentile romans did not care they weren't they weren't calling for jesus blood but jesus the jews were calling for jesus blood so pilate was going your own people don't even believe you so you're no threat to me so what is truth yeah all right then we looked in matthew 25 and we see talked about the the 10 virgins and i really enjoyed that my own self talk about the 10 virgins because remember they are virgins and we can skim through it so then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom now look five of them were wise and five were foolish so you've got five truth and five not truth all right yeah you got it that's right there's no there's not 11. no there's five wives and five foolish and not somebody just showed up in between no the wise but remember as i was preaching in kentucky look at verse five while the bridegroom tarried they all right like some of you doing right now slumbering and sleeping can't believe you fall asleep at 10 o'clock in the morning but anyway it's cause you're not listening while the bridegroom terries they are all slumbered and slept now look they slumbered and slept the prophet told us through the denominations why they slept through the truth right all of them did now there's a true bride in every age but they all had false doctrine except for those first three church ages right that's right because when nicea came in and then they come into 606 which is about when this church age began they accepted all that junk and i said jump because it was junk boston holy ghost was not the right baptist right that's my brother said it came from the pits of hell because it had to come from a false spirit right it comes from a thought spirit brought that in it brought in the eternal hells and all the different doctrines that they can almost prove by the bible because they read the same bible we do the bible says the worm never dies hell's got to be eternal but how in the world can you take eternal life that god give you and put it in hell you can't do it that's it very simple to me that there's no eternal hell i i don't care what man says my bible says that hell was created for the devil and his angels it actually wasn't even created for humans we're just ones that are going there if we don't do what god said right amen so while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at the midnight look there was a cry behold the bridegroom broom cometh go out to meet him bridegroom and they both all 10 woke up yeah yep yeah that's what's strange they all ten woke up brother luis they all heard the call like i said before we were talking in kentucky all those doctrines that you that you all grew up with how that mama am i still alone yeah how that mama passed on and you know brother ray mcgovern he's over there walking with jesus down the street that's not true that's fine we had to have a prophet come in the end time go across the curtain of time see what was going on brought it back to us and exactly put it in the scripture that we're waiting for a place and a time that we can't see jesus but you're not seeing him right now when if you're in the i think brother ray he had that laugh didn't freddy you remember he had that laugh when he give a revelation or he'd want to talk anybody well i'll guarantee you when he walked across the curtain of time and he stepped over there he saw brother branham or somebody he knew and he went ha-ha-ha i made it it's a bit amazing i made it but see you remember those little things about people that you'll never forget right and i don't think he'll lose that when he stepped over across the curtain in time he won't lose that character of being brother ray montgomery amen because we all carry that character with us but at the midnight the cry came talking about those virgins look 10 were wise undeceived and ten were fully a five word wise undeceived five were foolish deceived right pretty much cut and dry right all right because this one had oil oh i gotta get back up here this one had oil and i'm not using one of them candy sticks over there i can't hold ice cream cone and preach one of these sorry so as the bridegroom called there's ten there was five that had oil and five that didn't that was the only difference right all right because look brother brown tells us in the ten virgins in 1960 now if you'll take that name virgin and run it down it means holy clean and sanctified right they had an experience right they just didn't take a furthermore of the word of god and how the seed word planted in their soul right yeah right that's right that's the only difference right they didn't take a furthermore of the word of god and even brother adam says even the brides down through the church jesus that's why he said it's been brought by his church's bride surprise they took part of the work but they didn't take all of it in other words they didn't let that baby that was formed in them mature that's right because we got we got have grown men grown gospel in this end time not baby form so sanctified but the only reason they were foolish was one thing they didn't continue on satan got in there so satan got in there somewhere that's right satan got in there somewhere if i go over there might change it it's almost over here satan got in there somewhere and said you're good remember i explained that the other day you're you're fine you're oh you quit all that stuff you used to didn't you right trap of the devil i know josh i got it turned over this way a little bit trap of the devil here you'll never see this again turn it on we're going to improvise now this won't work what do we do helen give me some give me some blue hey we good all right they can hear me anyway this would be for for going on the internet i guess so there we go we see that look brother brown said now there was the virgins ten virgins again continue the quote if you'll pull it up please now there was the virgins went out to meet him and the foolish virgins now did not have oil in their lamp but they had everything else they were clean they believed in christ they preached the word that they believed hear that right they believed their denomination would let all that denomination would let them preach because see let me let me ask you about something you take this message and you go preaching in a denominational church they'll hear you so far but then they'll send you back home why got to be a truth and got to be a false they're saying they have the truth and you're false but then when you take it back to the word they shut up because there's nothing in there to sound off there's nothing there to signal truth you say well now wait a minute they got i'm just telling you what the end time is producing it's produced twins and they're all both religious they're not we look and say well the truth is going to church and the false is staying at home watching football [Music] we deal with the true and the faults right here in our self much less what goes over the pulpit you've got to pray that you're hearing truth you've got to pray that you're hearing truth amen so let's go to john 17 verse 16. this is pretty clear okay all right they are not of the world even as i am not of the world jesus is praying right here this is to me this is the lord's prayer to the bride i know what the lord's prayer is but this is the lord's prayer specifically for jesus's people for his bride in the end times everybody got that say amen they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so i have also sent them into the world and for their sake i sanctify myself we know that jesus was a human being he had human desires because he was in a human body but he but he sanctified his self set himself apart nazarite vow whatever you want to call it so that he can have what listen this this junk of of people thinking jesus had a wife on earth and all this stuff you see these movies and all that stuff that's filth because look christ only had one bride he's only got one wife he didn't have an earthly wife and a heavenly wife he had one wife paul says i espouse you as a virgin to christ and christ was already gone and for their sake i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through part truth oh that's not what that says that they also might be sanctified through the truth i am the way the truth and the life second timothy verse three uh third chapter verse 6. now watch this because this is the group of people that are on the opposite side everybody got that say amen there is a true and there's a false listen but like i said before you and i is we're not obligated to say who's true and who's false like i said before if you got somebody in your mind that you think i'm thinking about right now my my mind is blank of names you can call names wherever you want to but i'm talking about the spirits that are motivating these people the spirits that are motivating all of us hey did you have truth from the day you were born right no some of you didn't have truth until about two or three years ago well you told me you didn't yeah well get quiet now would you yeah yeah so listen until we let me just put it this way until we rapture and our bodies change there will be a part error in us somewhere right everybody got that right up until the twinkling of an eye we're gonna have just enough oil like i said before about about the airplanes you know they just got just enough fuel to get them there you get just enough to get it we got just enough oil they said we don't have enough oil we in other words we don't have two or three years to try to bring you up you've been sitting here two or three years now that's where god can separate not me and you but look these people here having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sword are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women i hope that's not the heat that just turned on i hope it's air conditioner for this sort of they which creep into houses and lead captive women silly women women's what churches women are churches led away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the what knowledge of the truth knowledge of the truth listen there's only way one way you know the knowledge of the truth needs to be born again you are deceived until that happens we're all deceived right if i got that say amen now watch now as janice and jamers whistled moses so do these also what resists the truth he says oh they don't resist the truth preach the truth to them preach the truth to them you'll find out where it resists or not amen they will resist you men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further i like this for their folly shall be manifest into all men as theirs also was so now let's bring it down to the end time terrence said be short i'm going to be real short all right revelations three here we are in the end time this is our church age the laodicean church age this is ours so this is what this is our salutation to anybody that's living in this church age if i got that say amen and to the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness now read you what true means that word true means in just a minute the beginning of the creation of god so what's he doing he's bringing us back to the true revelation the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now what was the beginning of the creation of god this is the time now the world says in december we know that jesus was not born in december but anyway we go along with it just just to play just to be here and don't cause no stir but he was the beginning he was the way we should have come as a virgin-born baby by spoken word not by instrumentality of man prophecy god tells us that amen you and i had to though come the way we did because of the fall because of what eve did but remember what i said this is this is not true this is false so god had to come if he was going to say i am the way the truth and the life if he would have lied he would have just went to heaven and and disappeared right and we had all died and went to hell right because we were born in sin shape and iniquity you got it but he did not he came back on the day of pentecost and said i'm going to right this ship i'm going to turn this thing around i'm not just going to be with you i'm going to be in you and if the truth is in you somewhere folks we've got to come to the truth if you have the holy ghost or the bible's wrong or i can't stand up here and say that the word of god is the truth because jesus said sanctifies him through thy truth thy word is truth everybody got that now look the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god bring it back up the greek lexicon is a latinos is that true that i pronounce that right liam she's she's got some greek in her so she hasn't done anything about cooking but she she's great so anyway i ate greek yogurt every morning so look that word true means that which has not only the name and resemblance but watch but the real nature corresponding to the name wow i like that the faithful and true witness in other words he's the only one and if you've got him inside of you you've got to have the same resemblance the same nature because it's the real nature corresponding to the name in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name amen that's why the bible says all heaven is named what jesus not just j-e-s-u-s brother brown said there's many jesus jesus we jesus is all over the place there's many jesus's but there's only one that takes the character and nature of the bible and matches it 100 percent jesus never never never did not correspond with the word he always corresponded with the word his nature was always of the war of the word not the world he said oh what about when he platted the ropes and that was god you never read the bible where he said god was angry right um you don't like a lot of things we do but in every respect i like this true witness now look i'm going to read you a quote where brother brown said now that doesn't mean at one time it was false but now all other false witnesses can't correspond to that right yeah right you got it for louise they can't correspond you correspond what to the name that's why we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ that's what peter said on the day of pentecost that's what jesus was telling him to do by revelation when he said father son holy ghost because father is not a name son is not a name holy ghost is not a name look if i want to correspond to father what father whose father are you talking about there's probably about 4 billion i'm in the world but when i tell you lord jesus christ you know exactly who i'm talking about so that corresponds to the name in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true and genuine opposite to what is fictitious counterfeit imaginary simulated or pretended that's pretty good isn't it so he's the faithful and true witness but now watch let's see what the prophet said about this in the layout of seeing church age he is the true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back there in revelations 3 7. you recall that it does not mean true as in contrast to false in other words he wasn't the false witness down through the church ages and all of a sudden in the laodicean church age he became true no look what it means you recall that it doesn't does not mean true as in contrast with false it has a richer deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization because the faithful and true witness in this end time is going to bring us to the truth not a truth right there we are it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial realization amen now let's go to ephesians 1. ephesians 1 says in whom you also trusted what after right oh this burns up to always was eternal and this burns up the the uh listen we believe in eternal security we believe in internal security coming from god not that you can be eternally secured and then you can do whatever you want to that shows see but that's that's false doctrine that's been taught right yeah many times really i mean i'm not saying but you go to a funeral a good baptist boy died not too long ago and he hadn't been in church in 30 years but he got saved when he was nine years old back at a convention somewhere and that was his salvation but he lived like a dog and if he gave his life to god i hope he did but if he didn't then what's he dependent on he was dependent on a lie he was dependent on lie if we don't have the truth we are depending on a lie in whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise what else can we do brother wade you can get justified sanctified and then ask god to put that truth in your soul because you promised it amen and the scripture with promise is what repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission and sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what for this promise is to you and to your children now that's bible how are you going tonight right because you go over to matthew 28 and 19 jesus said be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost what is the name of the father the son holy i like what brother brown said we were listening and he said he said no he said now listen i think brother brown said now listen he said peter was giving the keys to the kingdom in other words he was saying if peter said stand on your head to receive the holy ghost you'd have to stood on your head to receive the holy ghost right peter was given the keys jesus said whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven so peter can't be contrary 11 days after jesus said what he did he can't be contrary 11 days later and tell you to be baptized a different way there's only one way to be baptized everything else is what false true false all right but after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise everybody got that so now let's go to revelations 22 7. i'll just stand right here because i got my little ice cream cone in my hand and he said unto me look these sayings are faithful and true i want to ask you a question how do you know that how do you know that that that bible is truth it was written by 20 something different men i think it was whatever how do you know that they were telling you the truth i'm asking you how do you know that because the jehovah witness is going to come in and tell you it says one thing mormons is going to write their own bible tell you another thing i work with two of them i know exactly what the belief is and i've read their bible and it's just it's just an addition which there is no addition because jesus told us at the end of this book in revelations 22 he said if you add something i'm going to add you the plagues if you take away i'm going to take away your name out of the book of life pretty clear and he said unto me these things that's what i was thinking well when i start i thought and i'm gonna be a little sarcastic how do we think john didn't why why what makes us think john didn't get all that from the devil because i'm sure when he was on the isle of patmos the devil was talking to him too he just wasn't now sure he was having a good time in the lord i know but how do we know that the devil didn't interject a little bit of this only one word off remember in 66 books and moses wasn't around for the first three of them two of them really he wrote about genesis right wrote about his own death so he wrote it pre-death how do we know he's telling us the truth because right here i can put my trust because i have faithfulness and that is the word of god that god can keep it straight we can't and he sent prophets that's why i don't understand why people don't realize we that we needed a profit we've needed profits all through the since the dawn of time we've needed a profit to come and straighten out or try to yeah right amen there's been minor there's been major but there have been prophets when lord needed to talk to israel he sent him a prophet when the lord needed to speak to us he sent us a prophet amen why don't we why can't we realize that and the lord god of the holy prophet sent his angel now how you know that was a right angel you see what john was doing john had to have the baptism of the holy ghost in order for him to say that because it rang true with what he believed amen come on sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings well how do we know that you know why because when i open it i know it's god talking to me and it has not got convoluted or messed up or even paul says i looked through a glass darkly you see that glass where sister freda is that right there see that clear glass right there that's what paul says you down to the church ages that's what they look through right there can you see outside but you know there's an outside out there right you see well the sun you can see the light yeah but you don't know where it's at right but you could do it if you were looking through that glass outside this is the glass man you're looking through we're not looking through that glass darkly anymore paul said i'm going to do that but one day i'm going to see him face to face that's why god had to send us a prophet to help us and and get away from well we believed the teachings of william branham they were not the teachers away in teachings of william branham they were the true teachings of what the bible said amen they were the true teaching because this he was a faithful and true witness and i've got that same faithful and true witness living in me and every time i open this bible up oh sure it hurts it's a two-edged sword but what is it doing it's performing surgery supernatural surgery and my soul inside says amen that ain't nothing but the truth what had he right tap into the same thing all these writers did right john said there ain't nothing but the truth this is what's got to happen moses was writing the bible he said that ain't nothing but the truth what happened in the in the garden of eden i mean nothing but the truth when abraham had to be 99 years old be changed back into a young man to have a child a mystery that the world knows nothing about but it's laying right there in the bible everybody got it say amen all right let's read this right here we'll be done number five queen of sheba bless that woman's heart she was hungering and thirsting for god and she laid in those animals with these gifts and perhaps she said this i'm going up i ain't going to take nobody else's word now this is the queen of sheba going to see who solomon the wisest man in the world at that time i'm going to take nobody else's word i'm going to find out for myself if it's the truth i'll support it if it isn't the truth i'll bring my gifts back that's a good idea if god's in it put everything behind it you got your soul your heart your mind your talent all that you've got give it to the glory of god if he isn't god then let it alone and find out where there is a god if it isn't the truth let it alone and find out what is truth amen didn't we wander around and we were almost like pilate what is truth there's a church on every corner that's got different names on it is god that confused are we that confused because we got them on every corner about it too number six god provided place of worship i think this is the last one and now at the end time we see the things happening the way they are there's a great warning amongst the elected people of god to find out what is right and it behooves us to know that now not somebody's theory but to know what is truth what the bible says is truth because it'll be too late one day wow the bridegroom call you'll either be a wise a foolish virgin or you won't even be considered in it and this may be the day so let's take real consideration of what god has said remember when god speaks the word i love this right here when god speaks a word he can never take it back brother john that's what i have to depend on there's not another addition to this bible book of maccabees they got a book of job they got a book of this they got a book of that which has some truth josephus was there during the time writing but there was a lot of things he wrote that god didn't see to put in the word amen god didn't seem to put it in the words i'm going to believe that this is what god put together for me the truth remember when god speaks a word he can never take it back he has to ever remain the same he can never say something now okay there was jesus standing before he was ascension and he said go into all world preach the gospel baptize the name of the father name of the son or the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost but find me one place in history up until about 300 a.d that anybody was baptized in that they took that title from the roman catholic church and i see a rome but everybody that was a true believer was baptized in the name of jesus christ read your bible there's not one place you ought to see these people's eyes go wide open when you go to the philippines and say ten thousand dollars to the first person that'll ever show me that you that there was any baptized anybody baptized in this bible other than the lord jesus christ or jesus christ i'll give you ten thousand dollars boy you ought to see them in that mystery expo their bible they just are flipping through it you can't find it because it ain't in there they've been told what their truth is what their truth is is the truth but it was error but you watch them when they see that water baptism when they see the different things well you know then there's something that's striking down here and then as soon as they do what they do they listen you don't have to leave a denominational church when you believe this message you just start talking among the people you'll be extracted and excommunicated you'll be given as brother ernie says the right foot of fellowship out the door why because there's truth and there's error and they cannot how can two walk and not agree to walk together right here we'll finish remember when god speaks a word he can never take it back so in other words he didn't say father son holy ghost and then he go come over here and say well now peter's going to say no remember when god speaks a word he can never take it back he has to ever remain the same he can never say something and then say well i didn't exactly mean that boy that's pretty powerful to know that he gave us 66 books of the bible written by 20 different people and he tells you that's the truth right right and written i mean moses was like what 6 000 years ago 5 000 years ago thousands of years ago and then god comes down and gets everybody together and compiles it lets the king james get together and start compiling wycliffe and all the different ones start compiling it and it not be wrong i just got to believe that's the only true true thing there ever is is this bible he has to ever remain the same he can never say something and say well i didn't exactly mean that see he's infinite he wrote this bible before we were even formed this bible was written before the foundation of the world how can it be wrong if it was written then he had but he had to have a conduit right he had to have a conduit he had to have a way to get it pinned so that me and you can read it then he came down his self in flesh and he said okay whatever you're fixing to hear i'm the way i'm the truth and i'm the life all right look he is infinite he knows the best to begin with we say things that we think is best and after a while we take it back how many of you have done that no don't worry i'll raise all your hands you're lying if you keep it down okay so we pray for liars too but he knows the best we say things that we think is best and after a while we take it back but god can't do that and remain god so if he's infinite he does not do that because he is perfect in every word he never utters a word unless it's eternal glory wow so how what are you what are we doing with all these people i mean message and denominate they're changing the bible all of his eternals that's us was with him at the beginning his thoughts his attributes and they're only expressing themselves in the world today so where is the truth the the truth is right here inside of you if you have the baptism of the holy ghost it's the same guy that spoke that the same person that spoke it is inside of you how can he say something different than what he's already said he cannot say anything different he can't go against his word oh sure he can send you a prophet that can help you out as in paul and moses and brother branham are given a grace and marriage and divorce he said but it was because of misinterpreted theology we must get away from misinterpreted theology this world's full of it let me read this one quote the unfailing reality is living god in 1960 stand your feet musicians come we'll sing a song before we go make sure you get to the back of the door let brother terrence give you an envelope look you know a woman is the type of the church we're the bride everybody got that we're the bride the church is the bride there's a lot of brides and yet they let them women entice them the ministers today let them churches pull them off from the truth what if you don't preach the truth they'll just kick you out send you someone you know put you out and what does she do she cuts her hair she cuts off her power she has her way end time seed sign brother brown said in the face of all this there is a real bride that god's bringing forth each time there's been a reformer there's been so much of the word spread forth and each generation gets it did you ever notice they'll be a man of god come along strike a fire with god there'll be a great revival and what happens immediately after they take that man's idea they denominate it and bring in creeds and mix with it there she dies and never rises again but each generation what does it get it gets an opportunity at the fresh word of god each time like luther under justification western under sanctification pentecostals moving on the baptism the holy ghost each one gets his chance that what the that's then what does the man that follow the great reformers they denominate it organize it mix it with creeds a little bit here a little bit there a new bunch of school scholars he says death he said they died spiritually and that's the way it's always been the truth will never die that's why jesus said i am the way sure he had to die in flesh but that man inside of him was not dying i'll promise you that man inside of you that's what took brother ray over into that other dimension that that that thing that was formed in him at his new birth took him right over into that next dimension and there he was with brother branham and all the different ones that he knew they'd went on across the curtain of time sometimes brothers and sisters we envy that yeah amen but we've got a job to do until that because you and i have a job that we are ordained of god not to be in another church age were we okay with this doctrine and okay with that doctrine this word right now is pure just like when jesus stood on the listen when jesus stood on earth he wasn't creating a denomination but what if they based everything off of all the denominational ideas have been based off what brother bruham said the people that comes in and preaches the message somebody grabs it satan grabs it and twists it just like they grabbed this message and twisted it but there's a true bride there's been brides brides churches brides churches how many times did he say that he said but will come one and i contend that this is it i put everything i got on this sister trudy i don't have no faith and nothing else this right here is what i have my faith in that this message is [Applause] i right care what the world says what's that song let the world go by what yep man all right let's sing a song god bless you now remember when you leave we leave here to be at the back back there go down get in your car head to gillsville get into town go right past the post office there'll be a road that turns to the left across the railroad tracks go about a quarter of a mile there'll be a road that turns up to the left and if i get there before you all do or or somebody does we're going to put a little something there that you'll mar will mark it maybe a red bow or something and then you just keep going down that road it'll take you right you can't miss that bar and it's huge it's not a barn it's a venue but we call it a barn but it has a different name to it but we will eat down there and fellowship have our singing and gift giving uh i know some of the there was a question about the sunday school classes i think some of y'all got something some of you did that's okay this year has been you can't stamp nut listen that's why we have to put everything we got on what god said we came to rely on what man says because they said do this they said do that they said wear a mask and we're still got numbers way above everything else where's all them trump haters that hated when he didn't have a mask on that now said he's supposed to wear a mask now now we got a million more cases a day now and listen 50 of the people this world are wearing a mask and it's still going up so mass to me are not is not helping nothing that's not the answer this is the answer god's word is the answer this is the answer let's do what god tells us to do and let's move forward god bless you let's sing a song before we dismiss if you have a need come forward if you don't just believe it in your seat somebody he touched me oh i was shackled by a heavy [Music] but then the hand [Music] and now i am no longer the same [Music] god [Music] because someday [Music] [Applause] [Music] think about it now oh did he touch you today [Music] something can really happen and now i don't [Music] i [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the truth [Music] he touched me and [Music] he's good to us too now we're going to go down we're going to go down to the barn i'm going to go ahead and pray over the food that way when we get there we can they're supposed to start serving at 12 and you only got about 15 minutes to get down there so just god be with you um as i was telling the people in kentucky just real quick we we don't celebrate christmas as the world does but we do like this time of year i like what brother chris long says he said i live for christmas he said but that's every day of the year all right man so to a christian christmas is every day of the year but we do we i love i don't

amen satan's lied to us all of our life when we were born in sin shaping an iniquity when you got the new birth satan still started lying to you did i mean he really started lying to me then oh you didn't get nothing this jesus ain't nothing uh this is nothing oh come on all right right this is the way the truth and the life there's not a jesus christ in physical form flesh on the earth so he only has one group of people that he's in and that's the bride of jesus christ that's his body his church his bride not churches out there bride of jesus christ knows what to do with the word right
