verse 18 through 23 then we'll go to 36-43. but just remember all of these announcements remember all the sick father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for Calvary thank you for being who you are and revealing yourself unto us as who and what you are because we know and realize that there is nothing worth anything in any of us without you we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now and just have your way as we read your scriptures the words you've given unto us then you come and break that unto our hearts and our lives bless these that are away the sick ones and just be with each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Matthew 13 we'll start verse 18. he therefore the parable of the sower when anyone here at the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catch his way that which was sown in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside and remember he's explained in it but he that received the seed into Stony places the same is he that heareth the word and the none are at once with joy receiveth yet hath he not root in himself but do it for a while for when tribulation of persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended he also that receives seed among the Thorns is he that heareth the word and cure and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receive a seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also bears fruit bringeth for us which also bears fruit and bring us forth some and a hundred fold some 60 some 30. all right go to verse 36. then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and disciples came unto him saying declaring to us the parable of the tires of the field and he answered and said unto them he that here he he that saweth the good seed is the son of man now remember that he's the only sower of the seed we are just vessels to be used all right the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tires where the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angel and therefore the tires are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be at the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all that offendeth and then which do iniquity and she'll cast him into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing in Nashville teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as a son in the Kingdom of their father who have ears to hear let him hear you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been trying to cover the uh many different angles are points of view as you would call it uh or illustrations of you know the Bible and the way in the prophet's message and bringing it down and the last parts we were speaking of was how that the the same Bible that speaks of the bridegroom speaks of the Bride because it has compound meanings to the scriptures you know and showing it all right and then how she is to be the fullness of the godhead bodily now that was an illustration of going from here partial realization to perfect realization and coming forth and remember that the point we've always made when we talk about the bride be in the fullness of the godhead bodily or when we start in more this afternoon on the bride being the son of man remember that we're not talking about just the end time you know we're talking about uh the entire bride all the way down Through the Ages because you'd be leaving Parts out of it but now think about it see the reason we covered if you remember in the point of saying that the bride is the fullness or the godhead bodily that's the quotes your Prophet gave all right and to me that the reason is that the bride is the same material coming from the same source and even is eternal with him according to power page 151 of the church age book somewhere in church age it's the same source now watch that in a minute and you'll see why it's so valuable to try to hold her and him together as one source remember that was the argument at nicaea on 325 A.D not whether they was three gods or or whatever the argument whether was whether Jesus was God or another source you know all right which in when they took him and and trying to decide whether it was another source then that brought in the doctrine that would later develop into trinitarianism and it would would come forth see to try to make you something different from him now we're talking about the new birth in your soul not talking about you and I as people right as people we're people and even where we were reading of the children of the kingdom and and all like that everybody wants to take that as some kind of serpent seed you know this away and you and I a great seed this way just remember we were all born kin folks to the devil all right all Prophet or whoever he is he said was hybrid that's his words all right and see in being that then there's nothing good in you and I at all the children of the kingdom are the are the people of God right and the children of the tares are the wicked one is the ones who reject God you know and in the way of becoming into the family of God not dealing with whether it's serpent seat or not because we're all born kin folks to the devil all right we're all born between Satan and Eve all right now it doesn't say the prophet didn't say between the Beast he said between Satan and Eve all right see putting it all together as one all right but remember now that we've got to hold the point though that new birth that you have that eternal life that you have is the life of God because it's only one eternal all right there's only one eternal life there's only one Eternal God there's only one God so then when you get away and try to get into the to your trinitarianism you really get confused in the Bible and you'll miss the whole point so watch that now as we go along this morning because really this is a a kind of an inset message to prepare us to think about how the bride the prophet said is the son of man uh you say well that's I just don't believe that well then you're going to have to reject what your Prophet says so I'll let you do that you know I'll just read it that's why when we went to those with the bride be in the fullness of the godhead bodily we even ran off all of you the copies of where that we was to read it and those on the internet are reading it anyway and seeing it and they're capable of downloading it to understand so it's not what I'm saying but it is a point that I preached this in 1969 the first sermon that I preached in this message was that the Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man right now as we get to that point you'll see what I'm doing but hold a point in your mind that the the that he's not one now we're talking about the New Birth now not talking about human beings everybody understand the new birth makes us the children of God The Offspring of God in our soul all right then there's no difference in that eternal life that you have than the eternal life that God is because that is God's life right see then that way then he and I are one I in you as Wade was talking about Wednesday night and you and me the I and you can you understand because that's the holy ghost coming in you but then when he Jesus said and you and me that means there has to be some part of me yeah that was in him all right or else he said it wrong all right so then the only part I know that's in me that could be in him would be the new birth that I receive you know all right the eternal life see then that makes us the same source so what speaks of the Bride I mean the bridegrooms he speaks of the Bride he speaks of him being Eternal he speaks of us being eternal he speaks with him being the fullness of the godhead bodily right and then it would be speaking of you and I to be the fullness of the godhead bodily but not just the end time that's what I want to divide a little bit this morning to make sure that you understand what I'm saying because if you don't you'll miss the whole point all right but now remember the only difference between him and her brother random says is the Corporal body now the difference in him being here now or whether he was back under then is the Corporal body amen all right because it's the same eternal life it's just in a mini-membered body right called the bride of Christ all right and that whole body is him what him made manifest right all right now see then we are the attributes of God made manifest in our lives the new birth is is the attribute of God the Eternal life all right see see then she then is him trying to get a little off of the bringing it from the former messages and what I'll do probably next weekend excuse me this coming weekend Vernon then the next weekend I'll probably be still on this and we will get down to some questions and answers so you got a couple of weeks to write down things you know to to do and I wish you would study these things that's why I give them to you all right but see what she is is him made manifest right there's nothing good in you and I whatsoever period whether it be Body Spirit and soul it's all lost doomed and on the way to destruction right but yet he comes and gives us eternal life all right then it's his own life living in us as Paul said the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith is the Son of God all right see then that new birth brings us to the place to where that we can be as we covered last Services a many membered body that would be his offspring his children see why it's so important to get the new birth see why it's so important for you to have the new birth because without the new birth you don't have eternal life right he said well brother Dale I thought he the the new birth was just believing well then wherever you got Bible for that the disciples believed three and a half years went through a lot and still didn't get the Holy Ghost Jesus told Peter said after you're converted strengthen the brethren you see it's like Wade was bringing out Wednesday you know that those Old Testament Saints he could not have eternal life why because Jesus Christ had not been given the life that was in him see could only anoint them in the Old Testament because there was no way to enter into mankind back there and then remember we were bringing out that into many membered body and that's why we reflect back to the son of man and read it again as being the sower of the seed then he actually sowed his bride that's what he was doing while he was preaching he was preaching to the disciples right you know to anybody here but mainly to the disciples why where they would take that and they would sow that same seed right and see then them sowing that seed would be him in them still sowing all right so then he's not he's not stopped creating because he created his own bride right and he still as a member of the Bride is coming in today of somebody beginning the new New Birth being born again God is still creating he stopped the physical creation back Yonder but yet he's still creating now his many membered body all right now he said I want to make sure as I've said it before over and over and I've done said it one time I'll say it again make sure you don't misunderstand and get the idea that we are trying to make this end time bride you know the part we are to be something different from the rest of the Body of Christ it's just a point of where we are and what he has chosen us for right see because of specific purpose all right we've covered how that the bride of Christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily and if the prophet said he's not complete without you all right so then it is his choosing it is not what we choose we're not trying to pump up Prime up or make some kind of a special Doctrine to try to make us different that's what I keep emphasizing it we are the we're built on a foundation Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone all right so whatever the disciples taught we must teach that or we're not in the word and we're not the children of the Kingdom if we don't hold it together in the word all right see then doing it you run into trouble because it's hard to describe how that way God does things you see he started his church off on the day of Pentecost with 120 in the upper room and those were Sons and Daughters of God capable of writing the scriptures right he didn't give anything to novices or little kids you know because what kind of writings would you have if you had little children right might have better than some of us adults but not not the point he he used his church you know to write his writings to send it to mankind all right and in doing that then they were not anything different from what he was that's why Paul could say that if anybody comes and says anything different Galatians 1 8. he said even an angel he accredited that the angel brought him the Revelation right the mystery was brought to him by an Angel we believe that all right and he said even if an angel comes to say anything different he said let them be accursed I just don't believe it well you're the one that's cursing yourself now not me because I don't have no problems with that I've never tried to cast anybody into hell I've always tried to dig people out of it you know all right now but think about it then thinking about the ages as they come down and how did he starts off with a great church but it goes down all right it goes into the ground at niceea and then has to start coming back out in Luther you know Wesley Pentecost and then coming back into our age where we're at all right and those things are divided in uh the point but remember one thing it's the same God because he stands in the midst according to the Book of Revelation the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which means his presence is just as present in one age as it is the other age right and see people say oh no he wasn't down through there well then you've lost your even your carnality of human thinking because he he specifically stated that he was in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick well that would if you're going to take your carnal terminology that would make him greater in the middle right you see where terminologies go down to the door when we get to thinking that would put him in the middle greater than anywhere else but why not just let him be that he's a holy ghost in every age Prophet preached a message of that in the church ages right same holy ghost in every age it was the word that was eat down and it had to be restored back all right and what you do is we get through into the message later and covering it it was the son of man that sowed deceived it was the son of man that came forth in the early church he said Don wait a minute the Son of God well we'll get to that in a minute so just holds your point the son of man the prophet on its arise in the sun more this afternoon he said who is that son of man he said in the beginning was the word all right son of man refers to God manifest in flesh whereas Son of God refers to Holy Spirit dwelling in you and I not two different gods and it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal you know the Son of God to reveal the son of man is that sensible because the only what if 45 Christ is the mystery of God revealed I believe that's right the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word see I can't reveal it to you brother Branham couldn't reveal it to you Jesus rode around and said said my own life didn't reveal that unto thee but my Father which is in heaven see the Holy Ghost the only revealer of the word all right just as the son of man is the only sower of the seed all right but we're talking about coming back to the original seed that went into the ground all right coming back to the son of man is where we're we're going to be dealing with in a few for a few messages and to do that let's get something that will help us and then clarify some points and and you know but let's think about something we're very familiar with the word and we'll get to it in a little bit and brother random says that he's a dispensationalist then he says he's not much on being a dispensationalist so I think that needs to be clarified because of what he's saying because to me it's a great understanding but now dispensationalist is not in the dictionary you go into Google and pull it up and it'll tell you what dispensationalist means in the form but it's not a word it's a modern form of word you know bringing it more down to the days that we're living but see a dispensation is what we're talking about there was a dispensation in the Old Testament a dispensation of the New Testament all right we'll read in a minute that's where dispensation of the Son of God dispensation son of man dispensation son of David all right a dispensation then is very valuable if you understand what it means right because if you don't then you're going right back now watch my point we don't believe in a god of the Old Testament and a different god of the new do we no we believe that Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the new it's the same God all right so now when you're covering dispensations remember my point of what I'm driving at is I believe is what the prophet is saying that you can't have two different gods it's the same God the only thing it is is just something not different there was a Salvation in the Old Testament right right under the dispensation of the law there was salvation all right there's salvation under the new but remember Jesus Christ stood in the Middle with his arms stretched out both ways to cover the old and the new he had to pay the price for the old as well as the new there's no salvation in the Old Testament without Jesus Christ right so then when we're looking at it remember keep it the same Source keep it the same person being revealed and then you'll see why the prophet would make these statements so let's go ahead and we'll just pick up something look at number two and we'll start from that number one is I give it to you paragraph or page 150. he said it's the same source we're Eternal with him God manifested into many member body all right now watch this is paragraph 521 of question of questions and answers on Hebrews 2. he said Gentile dispensation and he's quoting the scripture we'll get to it in just a minute and Luke all right and it doesn't say Gentile dispensation in Luke you're watching you you'll get the point of what I'll be driving him sitting by the Gentiles until the you know wall to be trodden down and I'll Gentile dispensation now you people that don't believe in dispensations what about that the Gentile dispensation would be finished and when the Gentile dispensation is finished the time of the Gentile just finished all right now he's talking about believing in dispensations when I watched in a minute when we refer to other quotes it sounds like he doesn't believe in dispensation see I believe this is very valuable or I wouldn't be covering it all right I I I've got too much to go on down to preach I believe this is valuable for you and I to keep it in the right order so I go ahead now let's pick up number 2A and just read it because we'll read the scripture and if you'll look at the scripture you'll catch the point of what I'm driving out because the scripture doesn't say in the dispensation of the Gentiles it's not dark all right Luke 21 24 says and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captivity in all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled he doesn't use the word dispensation use times record that record that in your mentality all right in First Corinthians 9 and 17 it says for if I do that which do this thing willingly I have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me Paul is using the word dispensation all right Ephesians 1 10 says that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together all in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in the Earth all right Ephesians 3 and 2 says if we have if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word all right Colossians 1 25. whereof I am a made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God now dispensations okay we've done used one up here where he's talking about a dispensation look at number three all right this has taken 64. the future home and he's talking about the times in the coming down remember that the sevens Remember come up to the sevens and then he makes this statement says what are you going to do now you're a dispensationalist which I am I believe that God is too you're running out of dispensations types all right so he says I'm a dispensational he says and God is too God is a dispensationalist and he said I am too but then why would he come up now to we're going to give you the definition just a second and try to defied something where that you'll see what it means to believe in one true and living God you know I mean to a trinitarian he don't care how many gods you see right but the Bible would speak in the Book of Revelation of one God sitting on the throne right one God riding a horse one God doing this or that or the other the whole Bible see it's very valuable because see you you get all tied up in trying to study your scriptures but if you keep it to the one true and living God you got it right all right now watch what he says and the message says we would see Jesus number three a I just put three of them together in it so go ahead and pull up 3A and we'll roll it pretty fast this is taken from sirs we would see Jesus 57 12 11. now we're in the last days when Jesus at the closing of the Gentile dispensation and once I'm not much of a dispensationalist now he just said twice that he was a dispensationalist and God was a dispensationalist that's what I'm telling you you try to look up that word dispensationalist and you dictionary this is more terminologies of the last days aren't I'm not much of a dispensation now watch but I know that there is a dispensation of the Gentile Jesus said so in Matthew 24. now why would he say he's not much of a dispensationalist when he says Jesus is God is a dispensation he said he believed in dispensation what's this point go to the next one which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 58 207 E 33. this is the ending of the Gentile dispensation I'm not much of a dispensationalist but the Bible speaks of it that the Gentiles have come to their end yeah go to the next just to get these out of the way the message to the lady you see in church 58 609 I think it is Eve 9. this text of Revelation here is a message to the latest in age which I truly believe that not being a dispensationalist exactly but yet I believe that we're at the end of the Gentile dispensation that was spoke of now what's this what is the whole point I bring these out because see you you bring out something you you bring up and you read and people out on the internet you know and maybe some of you sitting there when I say that brother random is a dispensationalist and I say God is this I know where he says that he's not a dispensationalist and you don't cut off everything I'm talking about and you don't hear nothing I'm talking about and the rest of the message means nothing so I like to give both of them because you know my way of doing that I believe they will both come together to reveal a beautiful picture that we must have if not we're quoting each other as a Jehovah Witness reading room that will you read that and I'll read this and but they're different you know but I got a quote that's not getting down your quote I got a scripture donkey or something like a you know where it says baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the name of Jesus Christ but I've got a scripture where Jesus said father son Holy Ghost you know you're arguing scriptures but you're arguing over something that is a beautiful revelation then when Jesus said baptize in the name of the father and the son of the Holy Ghost you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why it says siren Acts 2 Jesus Christ then you go over in the scripture and says Lord our lord Jesus all right why because it brings out a beautiful picture into view now if a prophet would say I believe in a dispensation and God believes in a dispensation and we know that there is a dispensation we'll read it and he uses it throughout this message the dispensation of the Old Testament and dispensation in the New Testament and you just keep going one of the other to understand and that's what we're trying to understand because we read in a minute that this is the dispensation in the end time of the son of man we will see that it's a dispensation of the Son of God down through seven Church ages because it was a Holy Spirit but to be revealed in the end time as the son of man but it's the same God it's the same God being made manifest all right but see we try to look up words and we get a carnal concept of what words mean and remember we're in our our English language trying to understand the word of God which runs into a lot of problems all right but see look let's look up dispensation now what is a dispensation brother Dale as you've looked up the lights will go to the Greek Lexicon 36 22. that a dispensation is it means like stewardship it means the management now dispensation that's the word the management of a household or of the household of fires specifically the management oversight administration of others property the office of a manager or overseer stewardship Administration dispensation now you take that definition is the definition of stewardship you know is the definition of dispensation of those scriptures that we just use it doesn't look like that it's covering what we need to know but yet you can take this toward shift and you can move it over into it and line up with it you know and the things and and try to bring out the thing but just remember we're trying to look at the word dispensation and we're trying to look at it as a dispensation of the Old Testament a dispensation of the New Testament right a dispensation of the law a dispensation of Grace all right and looking at it then this definition doesn't ring out what we need they said you can take stewardship you can take those things or a household or you know management of a household and say he's the manager all right if you understand but think about it we're not trying to talk about managing a household we're not talking about trying to be a good steward because you were supposed to be that in every dispensation right yeah I mean we're supposed to be that in the Old Testament as well as the new but what are you dealing with all right let's go back to think about what we read in Luke where brother Reynolds says and uses it in the refers and says the dispensation of the Gentiles when it doesn't say that you know literal wording it says the times of the Gentiles the times of the Gentiles all right now Webster says that dispensation is the act of an instance of dispensing Distributing giving out so that doesn't ring up to hold together what we need to understand see now a dispensationalist we had to go through the Googles and the things here to get that because I couldn't find anything I've checked on it and the word dispensationalist is not a word in the dictionary he'd come up into the modern forms like remember we used to say ain't in the finally put that into dictionary as a a form of word but it was there as the little four-legged creature that runs on the ground but we used it so much until they finally put it in the dictionary all right but you see that's more modern terminology in a dispensationalist is like a dispensationalism you can use that word but it means that it's a dispensationalist theology so a dispensationalist is if one who studies dispensations because it's a dispensationalist theology referring to the unified teaching of dispensationalism all right I know that don't mean a thing to most of you it's just all this past 10 minutes 15. you know it's gone but it's very valuable to me because that way I can keep it together and then somebody comes along said oh you didn't know it brother randomly used that over here that he didn't even believe in that well the quotes I gave you where he said he didn't go along with that much he goes right on to say that there's a dispensation of the Gentiles so what are you saying brother Dale why not convert that word dispensation into Times and remember that it's the same God in the Old Testament is being revealed in the New Testament he didn't change God's you changed the times then you're not going into a dispensationalism Or List as to be just studying dispensations you can see what brought a random is saying that he believed in dispensationalist in the basis that it's revealing the same one true and living God that there was salvation in the Old Testament the Salvation in the New Testament all right now that's dispensations but the same salvation now dispensationalism or dispensationalist theology what if you're a trinitarian then you had a god of the Old Testament remember father you know he knew you've got a god of the New Testament son so you'd be totally out of the scriptures so you can't follow the scriptures you can't line up with that form because you're into trinidarianism I mean this ought to help you a little bit on one God it's the same God being revealed in the Old Testament is in the New Testament all right it's the same God being revealed in Bride form in a many-membered body right it's not another God see if you were going into dispensationalisms you can go into any kind of a theory or a theology that would divide up those things and they'll cover seven dispensations I've got them in office you've got seven dispensations according to dispensationalisms you got this you got that you got all kinds of things but yet it won't tie together because if you're taking trinitarianism to try to understand one God where are you going to be but if you take it as a dispensation that God is revealing himself this way here and this way here now you can understand the church ages you can see that it started out as a great beautiful church with the true teaching of one true and living God what you can see is the word went down and it started to be restored that you're coming back into a time that they didn't have all the word revealed right Luther come forth the best he could be which was great it's in the Bible spoke of I will restore the years of the Canton Warren by more Locust caterpillar but Luther couldn't bring it all forth these two is the same illustration is if you're taking trinitarianism you're going to have a God here and a God here and it'll make it two different gods but if you take the same God that was in the early church and let that word that seed go into the ground and then that seed come back into two little shoots of Luther and you'll see that that grain is heading back toward where it's supposed to be and then you can cover and they'll cover your dispensation then you come over to Methodist see more is brought out why because it's coming back more towards original all right so then it's coming back to the truth of understanding then you come into the Pentecostals with the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother around said no message to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in a great prophet that's not brother random because he says it that's 464 the old silver he said then that's the other the messenger comes at the end of the age see this since the day of Pentecost of Zeus history this has been a prophetic age no that's only with brother Brown me no the Holy Ghost is the prophet right I remember we were up at Jeffersonville when Billy Paul come out there in the old thing with who was to take over and who was the guide after who was to be this holy ghost that was to leave he said I just heard the prophet say the Elijah of this day is the Holy Ghost well that was good you know you're not changing dispensations as to make this this dispensation be great and this dispensation not be very great that's my point of trying to get you to see that it takes the whole entire bride to seven Church ages to be the fullness of the godhead bodily it will take the whole bride through seven Church ages to be the son of man but we're just in the end time dispensation we're in the end times words to come forth in full manifestation that don't make us no different in Luther's justification that's where I've been fought all the years trying to bring that oh he was how fun he was Omega how many of you heard messages on and he's nothing in between that's a direct quote then he's an alpha and omega and all in between that's a direct quote now well you got two quotes fighting each other well I want this one I believe this one you you can take that one you ever heard people in the message say we as the bride take Acts 2 38 as for our baptism you know Lord Jesus Christ consider denominations take father son Holy Ghost if they took Father Son and Holy Ghost they would get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they took a perversion of it and took the literal compound meaning of the word and died with it so can we that's why I fight so hard I know I make it hard why because we don't play in church I was thinking the other day and and I won't do it now but I was thinking especially out on the internet too but but them on the internet I can't see you so you can raise your hands if you want to but if I asked how many here have the baptism when the Holy Ghost a lot of hands go up and I'd say how many of you believe that by having that baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes you the bride of Christ everybody's hand it went up the first time or to go up the second time all right right well watch it watch your hand go for that how many of you believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily that's what the Bible says and what's your prophecy but the hands don't go up you believe it all right up to a while and you'll say well now brother Dale in a way or our brother Brandon was really just saying something to you know make us feel good he made me feel good because I read the quotes in the church in Athens Georgia in 1969 and back then we just had very little concordances of most of it was handmade off the tape recorders ourselves as quotes from The Prophet and I thought enough of it I wrote it in the front of my Bible and everybody's ever here you know I can hold it up and show you the quotes that I used then and I just kept adding to it that's where the computer come in to help us I used to buy every concordance could be bought even though the first 15 pages was to prove a false Doctrine still bottom you know why because what they were saying was right they were just interpreted it wrong and the rest of the message I was getting the quotes I didn't give a hoot about your Doctrine because that goes into what it's talking about dispensationalist but theology that you can argue over dispensations um but the Bible is divided up into things to be revealed maybe it's the way of saying it and that word things is not thrown off on God but it means that that Luther couldn't make manifest what we can make manifest but when are we going to believe it like I said I believe I'm bride I've heard people say I believe I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know where I'm where I'm gonna be in Rapture or not now that's a great understanding and I say how many believes you're born again oh I believe how many believe you in the bright well I don't know yet whether I'm in the bride that's utter stupidity if you have the Holy Ghost that is the bride right and why can't we believe that if Luther made it manifest in his day Wesley made it manifest Pentecost made it manifest brother Branham made it manifest what are we doing sitting around waiting on the bus you know well when when uh when when the woman gets in the White House it's got to be a you know it's got to be elected president now the United States you know and she's got to be a pope too because she got quotes right one a woman in the White House there wasn't a pope and so you know about the United States so once you put it all together and just make some of these women let them run for president let them be the pro Pope too that's what it is it's this Plum silliness because we're looking for something to happen when brother Brown said like the the moon turned into blood he said I can show you where that happened we're still looking for the moon to turn the blood oh if I ever see it with a with a red Cloud going across the Moon it turned to blood there it is we're ready to go now I thought it was Rapture in faith Rapture in Revelation that was going to take us out of here I didn't know it was just because of dating the times and the seasons Paul said I'm scared of your experience we get people to really hear dates and times and to hear the truth right well see when I look at dispensation then there's a Time for the Bible says at the time what to all it doesn't say there is a time for all things that's in Ecclesiastes it does not say that it says there's a Time to not a Time far because that would mean you got to wait to that there's a time too when God brings it to Pius it'll be right did you understand what I'm trying to get at yes we can look at a dispensation of the Old Testament we can look at a dispensation of the New Testament we look at the dispensation of one being the law we look at the other half be in Grace but do we see the same God or do we change gods in the middle and get a second person or something right you know a prophet coming over after years and years of preaching one true and living God he's rejoicing overseeing three now if I'm putting this not getting it right together the whole point you get it together he saw the rainbows and things and it The Voice or something said Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new good night yet he'd always preached that right he said in him never preaching a trinity but he said I used to think that God hated me and Jesus loved me he said until I found out it's the same person come on Church it's about time for us to to get into it what is what are we here for that's all I've been screaming about for 40 something years not had to change to get a new doctor and get a new date and a new time and a following or another to follow her or something as a matter of fact God has always seemed to have left me alone I just don't fit nobody's camp I never have they tried to get me into this and try to get into the ice don't fit well I guess I'm just too independent too stubborn and the older I get I get more independent more stubborn and you do too okay you're young you do it too listen Church do you see what I'm talking about to understand why Prophet would say I believe in dispensationalists but I don't believe in dispensations he's putting together something in a way because when his thoughts this year of believing in dispensationalist he said God is a dispensationalist and the Gentile dispensation and the then when he moves over he's still using the same scripture but he's seeing it that if he's seeing a God over here different from the god over here you know one over here at the Old Town one over here is the New Testament oh that old time he was angry hateful well even mean hateful was he who made the first killing in the Bible God to cover his children the first murderer of physical things was God himself to cover us who is that hateful arrogant old mean God of the Old Testament when he says Abraham I give you an unconditional Covenant come on that don't sound like a arrogant hateful old Dodie God he's not fixing to kill the people and Moses said Aaron grab your sensor run among the people free adventure you may make an atonement you know what God backs off on what he's doing right I mean arrogant hateful God that Moses said one day he says now listen if you kill them people you got to come over me all right okay Moses okay Moses I will come over here we said one of these days I'll visit them but we look at it as what kind of a God have you got if Jehovah the old is Jesus unto you if it's right in the Bible do you believe the Bible don't raise your hand just if you believe it well then Hebrews 13 8 says he's the same what oh he's the same today and tomorrow because that's Utah no that's not exactly the way it says it says Jesus Christ is saying yes today Old Testament today not their worries standing in Forever the same God do you understand it then the church ages is covering the same God but it's just the way he's making himself known that was what he'd done in the Old Testament I write these messages down I think man I'm going to get through this message in a hurry I ain't going to get through this and it'll be this evening I'll finish it but do you understand the times the Bible says of the Gentiles be fulfilled the prophet interpreting that says the dispensation of the Gentiles so then what we need to use as dispensation is the word times that's not changing nothing we can read what Paul would say in the times that God chose to give this these Church aides was God was revealing himself in those ages as I said while ago he's in the midst of the seven golden candlestick means he's in every Church age the same but you just can't make himself manifest because they don't have the word he was in the Old Testament right come on brother Brown said that was Christ in Moses that could tell God a better way of doing something it was Christ coming down through there but he couldn't make himself manifest as a savior could he because it was a different dispensation he was born a baby laying in a Manger he wasn't a savior he was a savior to be later on right he was coming to be king right he was a prince Prince is one in the leading line to go to be king you know what's going to happen to King got to get out of the way it's right do you see what I'm talking about then throughout the whole Bible at the whole Bible is revealing the one true and living God see it doesn't wind up into Revelations with a different God it's just the basis of how he's dealing he's a wonderful God person today gets saved somewhere right here or anywhere but say they've never heard nothing you know and then they come in and they they get saved you know God don't require them to understand everything right but I get into the silliness of it you know like I say I'd preach to some of you for 10 years to try to get some Doctrine out of you that I can see there that you can't see you got or won't admit you got but then you start to tell if somebody else to say I saw that immediately the quickest the prophet said man I saw that I saw that immediately I said well why did it take me five years to get you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come on I'm sorry I'm just too old to be playing but I didn't play when I was there in my 30s you go back and listen to the tapes back there there here and you hear me screaming and hollering these same things why because church I've always looked at it and believed it if I could if that was the first message I preached that the bride would be the son of man you think I've changed since then but it was a wonderful thing to start out amen I mean I didn't come up with any little sugar tits you know well God is good and we're all good and we don't need to throw off on anybody because we're all the same we're not going to be a Christian Life that would not be nothing you don't have to be born again to be a good right you know we're not you don't have to be born again to not look down on nobody else in order to teach your kids that you're going to be taught from birth that you're no different that's wrong we don't have no problem with racisms or nothing why because we never were racist I don't even know the difference in them words I can't keep up with it I've never looked down on anybody as a coloration of a skin we're all human beings let's see Church look when God is revealing himself he's revealing it for the hour the time ah right right we'll get to it more this afternoon where see Jesus kept saying son of man son of man son of man why because that's what he was making manifest he wasn't making manifest Son of God that would come as a baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost but it would be a revealing or a time to all things a time for this to take place this is the end time for us to realize Who We Are but there we go I believe I'm born again I believe I'm bride I don't know about this being the son of man brother Brown's just on a man run around and make these son of man he says he wouldn't now you argue with him about it he said he was a son of man the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man so if you say he was decent of man you're making him the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what a lot of the people of the message has done well yes you tell them that they're a deity as to that and they'd fight you but your Doctrine proves what you're thinking you know the best way to find out what a preacher is preaching I found this out a long time ago you sit down talk to him all you want to and you'll never know what he's preaching just go to his congregation and ask them right and especially get up and preach something contrary to what he's talking you're going to find out in a hurry what what he believes right that's the people what the pastor believes and I'd hope you'd give the right answer there's one thing about brother Dale he believes one true and living God because every Sherman that's what he preaches one true and living God well 40 something years I'm still preaching on it we stay around here another 40. oh that'd make me older but my Lord Church why don't we to make manifest well brother Branham done it all we're just sitting down waiting on the end of time now I want to see that in the Bible I want to see it in the quotes of the Prophet I don't understand anything I want to see it in plain common sense well I believe right around was a prophet but I don't know about you if I read what he says you're not arguing with me you're not arguing with me if I read those quotes about the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily you're going to talk to him about that not me I read what he said well you slanted it I see you're slammed you got to Pulpit this evening men women children whoever wants it and I don't mean that sarcastically I mean it is a God's honest truth I'll let your sister get right up here this evening in this pulpit and straighten me out on what I've tried to preach to you for 40 something years and it'll go on internet where they can see it see that's just why I believe it and when I believe something I'm going to stand for it what is that old saying if you won't stand for something you'll fall for nothing or something like that anything yeah at least tell somebody what you believe I'd rather tell you what I believe then if I'm wrong I get the benefits what if I'm right ain't gonna worry about it but you see that's what the people don't want to talk to you like that but I'm just saying I like to see when brother Randall will come along and say I'm a dispensationalist and God is then he says I'm not much on being a dispensations I know there's something got there got to be put together and when it does I can be happy because I'm not just quoting quotes I can see it by revelation was totally against the dispensation of the Old Testament to be anything different than the new other than that was the law that was the time that was salvation under that law but it could not bring the New Birth and then it would come into the New Testament as to bring in that same Jehovah and then the prophet would say it you know Jehovah crying in a cradle prop he took a prophet say that no Theologian would ever even have enough sense to have you ever heard him say like this he said a god with no teeth I remember when I first heard god with no teeth but see he couldn't have a baby die for our sins even at 12 years old or 13 whatever that he would argue with the priest he could argue with them in the word but yet he couldn't die for the sins of the people when he started his ministry on the River Jordan he could not die at that time it would have to be three and a half years or something there later that he would be able to come and die for the sins of the people why because it would be the times of it time for this and the time for that but I hope you understand maybe they'll get it out of the way at least to what I believe the reason I say it don't look as to think that we in the end time are something special we're different from all the rest of them that was Alpha back to our national Omega down here and boy we're great look at us you heading to the garbage can when you think like that don't think too much about it because you're already in the garbage can when you think like that but when you see that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he was he still is and forever will be right a dispensation a way of showing himself for the time but not showing something else it's one of the Bride I keep emphasizing that the bride is not some other source he is the same Source made manifest by the new birth and the difference between him and the bride is the physical Corporal body that he lived in because we live in these sinful garbage cans but we're coming to a place to have a body like unto his glorious body if we have a body lock into his glorious body you know what that means evidently going to be like him right right Wednesday night and he didn't know where I was headed you know turn on over here a little bit and I get over to Genesis 1 26 27. we don't talk about what we're going to preach deliberately you know why because I don't want him to be influenced I don't want these brothers to be influenced I wondered pretty much on their heart because that's the only way I'll know whether they preaching the truth or not because if not they're just saying what I say what good is that make your twofold child of hell and start with come on musicians think on these things we are in a day and a time that there is a word to be revealed in this day we're in a dispensation if you want to call it but we're not changing God's to change dispensation it's the same God made manifest in a many-membered body there's no way that we could have anything to do with even thinking about being the fullness of the godhead bodily if he had not ordained it to beat that away because we can't be anything as long as we keep remembered we're nothing we're all right well brother Dale I'm trying to be something well go ahead I'm trying my best to be nothing then he can use me but if you're trying to be something you're getting the wrong idea you know that a sister used to play the piano for us told me she said the way it's preached here and you realize we were preaching back then so the way it's being preached here in the church about the one true and living God and us being God made manifest in flesh she said well then it don't matter what I do I said sister you've got the wrong idea the more that I see of what he is the more conscious I've become of how this garbage can is in the way I told her I said you've misunderstood she said yeah but it's preaching I'm gone I said but it's not that kind nope I knew that let's stand go ahead bro 161 unspirable hey sons are breaking news yesterday you'll remember thank you Matthew Matthews preparations everybody gosh not fears Alid tonight foreign the days Nations foreign of Victory is growing there is Library story is

who's going to be president who's going to be this who's going to be that ain't come no concern to me my concern is for you and I to do one thing and that's become what God says we are the only way you can do that is by reading or and studying it it's not going to come by some special thing falling out of the sky God has already give us the word what else do we need what would it be to try to something to stir your thinking well not just read if that don't stare you there's something wrong with you I mean I love we've listened to a tape last night in this California thing and brother random he spent longer in a prayer trying to get people to alter and probably the time that he preached because he was concerned and you know what his thought was I want a Revival as Angeline Temple he said I want a Revival he said I've even canceled my fishing trip that I'm supposed to leave and go he was going to somewhere where he always wanted to go fish down in Mexico or somewhere New Mexico or Mexico one he said I've canceled that he said I'm going to stay here he said I want a Revival he needed for praying and the people coming to the halter you see the man's sincerity it wasn't a great seals the plagues the vowels the trumpets to things it was the Simplicity of trying to get them to see Jesus cry he was trying to beat him to come to a Revival never hurt him that long I've heard the tape before I know a lot of times I'm just like you when I get ready to go to bed or something at night I listen to the tape and dude when he comes down to the prayer line or something we turn it off and go to bed because we're out something but 45 minutes or something he was still giving an altar caller talking to the people the prophet of God was doing that in order to be the desire in each one of our hearts and lives for a Revival let it begin in me because that's what I've prayed for 40 something years is for people to see who they are when you see who you are you're going to be in a Revival and you may be the only person that's in it right because it's to you personally father we just thank you Lord we love you we just ask you to go with us now as we go into the natural meal bring us back together this afternoon in your love we love you father and we thank you have your way in Jesus name you dismissed
