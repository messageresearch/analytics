[0:01] all
[0:03] right Isaiah

[0:27] for the came and all over the world
[0:37] have sister with us
[0:43] from we' known him for about eight years
[0:45] now six seven years and GE we still
[0:48] learned things that we've done almost
[0:50] the same so I think
[0:52] maybe we were in a past life brothers
[0:56] and sisters for real so but than one
[1:00] more thing Jun you didn't think nothing
[1:02] about them coming mama she thought I'd
[1:03] bought her a new
[1:05] car he put the blindfold on me I thought
[1:08] he was taking I mean when you well I
[1:10] mean I just thought that were coming you
[1:12] well not I mean I knew they were coming
[1:14] on my birthday but I didn't know that
[1:16] there was anything no she was getting
[1:18] sick nervous that she thought I
[1:28] had
[1:31] buy her one buy me one he's not buying
[1:33] me there's one thing for sure folks one
[1:35] thing for sure she's never going to
[1:37] trust
[1:39] anybody I you I repented of My Little
[1:43] White Lies last night the clock that I
[1:46] had last night to repent so I repented
[1:48] they didn't even tell me about it you
[1:50] know what we
[1:52] were weight well I was working out it
[1:56] just taking
[1:58] longer all right listen we're on
[2:00] internet they don't care about
[2:06] that are you I said I'm at Pine
[2:11] gr it happen so he had to come off but
[2:14] thank all of you for for
[2:16] helping yes thank you very
[2:19] much all right so we've been going
[2:21] through the breach and now what did we
[2:24] see out of the breach was the breach was
[2:28] a time time to where a lot of people
[2:31] think that a breach means a a gap which
[2:34] it does but a breach also means that you
[2:37] break
[2:38] through that's what when you breach
[2:40] security what do you do you broke
[2:41] through security so what we're doing in
[2:43] the Bible brother Rand had to preach the
[2:46] breach to show the bleach of the blood
[2:49] of Jesus Christ for Redemption because
[2:51] that's exactly what all the seals are
[2:53] for is for Redemption but now what did
[2:57] we see in job see job said in my flesh I
[3:00] shall see God but in the end time we got
[3:03] to say the same thing but in my flesh I
[3:05] shall see God without death job couldn't
[3:08] say that he was one of the ones back in
[3:11] the Old Testament that couldn't be born
[3:13] again because Jesus hadn't died yet
[3:16] blood hadn't been
[3:19] shed but looking forward to a group of
[3:22] people like you and I he at least got a
[3:25] better Revelation than a lot of people
[3:27] he said in my flesh I shall see God
[3:29] right my flesh not another so it's a
[3:32] personal revelation of Jesus Christ in a
[3:35] new birth but it's got to continue past
[3:38] the new birth past the new birth that's
[3:40] what that statute of a perfect man is
[3:42] for you see that Holy Spirit up there
[3:43] that is the same Holy Ghost you receive
[3:46] but there's more word attached to it
[3:47] there's more life there's more not human
[3:51] knowledge but holy ghost knowledge
[3:53] knowledge of the word of God all right
[3:55] so that's what we saw in the breach and
[3:57] also we saw that um that brother randam
[4:00] was in the breach he was showing us
[4:02] there was a connection with the church
[4:04] ages and when we went through the other
[4:07] day and was showing that you know a lot
[4:09] of people in the message think that
[4:10] Redemption is over because brother R
[4:11] said in Revelations 5 that Jesus went
[4:15] and sat on the throne his redemp his
[4:17] mediatorial work was over well and we
[4:21] explained that I'm kind of go over it
[4:23] again before we start on the first deal
[4:25] but what happens is is you got to look
[4:28] at this thing
[4:31] as being
[4:33] finished that's what I dad and I were
[4:35] talking coming on the plane back from
[4:37] brother Jesse
[4:38] funeral brother brandham spoke I don't
[4:41] believe brother brandham you everybody
[4:43] gets into this Rema Loos and starts
[4:45] preaching all these different things
[4:47] brother Brandon was a human but yet he
[4:48] was a man sent from God to give us a
[4:50] message right brother Brandon would say
[4:53] you were always was eternal you wern't
[4:54] born on any certain day that was not the
[4:57] human William brandham telling us that
[4:59] that was God telling us because in God's
[5:01] mind it was already finished but then
[5:03] brother Brandon could turn around and
[5:04] say in another quote he said you start
[5:07] your eternal life right here at the
[5:08] altar right that was the human William
[5:10] brandom telling the human people you got
[5:13] to begin here at the altar but when God
[5:15] was
[5:16] speaking in the first person this is
[5:18] what I believe it's just me cuz you
[5:20] can't put the two quotes together how
[5:21] you going to take a quote where brother
[5:22] rown said you always was eternal you
[5:24] wasn't born again on any certain day
[5:26] then he said your eternal life started
[5:27] at the altar that's a contradiction
[5:30] in our human mind that's right but but
[5:33] the Revelation that I have that that D
[5:36] and I were talking about is that that
[5:37] God was speaking to us and saying you
[5:39] always and in God's mind we were always
[5:41] Eternal remember this Prophet went back
[5:43] into God's mind like no one else did
[5:46] actually he didn't go to God's mind
[5:47] God's mind came to him all right and
[5:50] gave him the Revelation that hey if
[5:52] you're born again that eternal life that
[5:55] you have never had a beginning that's
[5:57] right and it will never have an ending
[5:59] that's right
[6:00] and we are raised up sitting right
[6:02] sitting in Heavenly places MH right now
[6:05] MH that Soul you have and that's what's
[6:08] going to be
[6:09] hard because when we read Isaiah 53
[6:12] there's your Daniel 70 weeks your
[6:14] sixfold purpose that is also six
[6:17] seals in Isaiah 53 he was wounded for
[6:21] our transgression bruised for our
[6:22] iniquity iniquity the chastisement of
[6:25] our if we don't see that he did that you
[6:28] can't start for this guy
[6:30] right you can't start Redemption for
[6:32] this guy that you looking at now the one
[6:34] you're not looking at that was born
[6:36] again in 1998 he never said a bad word
[6:39] he never had iniquity right he never did
[6:42] anything wrong right the soul I'm
[6:44] talking about the soul they real inside
[6:46] me the new birth that came to me in 1998
[6:48] and cleansed this guy out and made me a
[6:50] new creation well you know what my
[6:52] Redemption is over that's
[6:55] right my redemption's over that's right
[6:58] sir for the
[7:01] soul and we're going to
[7:03] see the body's got to go with it that's
[7:07] right if we believe
[7:09] this that's true in my
[7:14] flesh not a flesh somebody else gave me
[7:17] right and the flesh that Mom and Daddy
[7:19] gave me I'll see God cuz job didn't say
[7:22] in my in my new flesh right he's going
[7:26] to have to go through a change that's
[7:28] right but you and I going to have to say
[7:30] this and go through it without death
[7:31] that's why we're going to have to have a
[7:32] change here right all right the Holy
[7:35] Ghost is going to come give you the new
[7:37] birth and then you're going to grow in a
[7:38] statue of a perfect man all the way up
[7:40] to where it says love the Capstone all
[7:42] those virtues and God's going to seal
[7:44] you away because remember Jesus was on
[7:47] the River Jordan and God said through
[7:50] the prophet brother brandham he didn't
[7:52] read it like they did in the Bible he
[7:54] said this is my part of the earth that I
[7:57] have
[7:58] redeemed and from this part read it in
[8:00] future home and from this part of the
[8:01] earth what Jesus's Earth he said I'll
[8:03] redeem the rest of it right cuz what did
[8:06] he do he he there was a curse put on in
[8:08] the garden God didn't curse Adam and Eve
[8:11] he cursed the ground so here's the
[8:13] ground it's curse where were you and I
[8:16] you and I were in this table this ground
[8:20] right then your mom and daddy ate beans
[8:22] and potatoes and and procreated you you
[8:25] come out of what you come out of that
[8:27] cursed earth right
[8:29] but Jesus Christ didn't come out of this
[8:31] cursed earth right a body thou Hast
[8:34] prepared me he said sure it was a human
[8:37] body but it didn't come out of what Mary
[8:39] ate sure it nourished and brought that
[8:41] body out but that body was the body of
[8:42] almighty
[8:45] God but remember when it was born into
[8:48] this
[8:49] domain it started dying because Jesus
[8:52] was 30 and look 50 so his body wasn't
[8:55] Eternal but from that body from what
[8:58] we're going to read right now because
[9:00] his
[9:01] soul was given for a purpose but also
[9:05] his body was given for a purpose all
[9:07] right to get into this first seal we're
[9:09] going to have to see that that we
[9:11] are as Isaiah says here he was wounded
[9:15] for our transgression but remember
[9:17] Psalms said we were what born in sin
[9:20] right shapen in iniquity a spouse from
[9:23] our mother's womb a liar putting two
[9:25] verses together of scripture all right
[9:28] so now let's read Isaiah
[9:32] 53 and pay attention to what this is
[9:35] saying right cuz you got to see in
[9:39] Revelations 5 we saw and how many times
[9:42] did I go over and over we're
[9:44] number
[9:46] 12 on the breach and this is the breach
[9:48] SL first seal so we took 12 30 minute
[9:51] sections talking about the breach and
[9:55] what you know what it meant to
[9:57] us but
[9:59] as far as we're concerned Revelations 5
[10:02] was the opening of the seal that's what
[10:04] the prophet said right cuz the next time
[10:06] you see the book is open right he takes
[10:09] the book sits on the throne he has he
[10:11] has acquired something he has taken that
[10:12] book in his possession sit down on the
[10:14] throne and then he begins in Revelation
[10:17] 6 to what open the seals and then we see
[10:19] in Revelations 10 that that little book
[10:21] was open all right
[10:25] so if I believe that then I have to
[10:29] believe that what Jesus Christ did in
[10:31] flesh and gave his solar Ransom like
[10:33] we're going to see here that my
[10:35] Redemption is over that's right so I can
[10:40] believe that in my flesh I shall see God
[10:44] but remember one thing we got to look at
[10:46] it the way God looked at
[10:48] it but humanly we got to go through the
[10:51] Journey that's right pardon is not a
[10:53] pardon unless it's accepted as a
[10:55] pardon brother Claude died myself we
[10:59] preach the pardon
[11:01] right we do like Abraham Lincoln every
[11:04] time we get up there we sign the pardon
[11:06] but unless you say that's for me right
[11:09] that's right that's right it does no
[11:11] good that's right okay so you still got
[11:13] to accept it you can't shout and praise
[11:16] God about being uh born again if you're
[11:18] not if you can't shout and praise God
[11:19] and say well my body's changed look at
[11:21] me no your body's not changed till I'm
[11:22] looking at it's old right mhm okay so
[11:26] let's have reality but let's look at
[11:28] what God saw God saw this thing
[11:30] over and done
[11:33] with so I'm standing in the body that
[11:35] I'm going to live in for eternity now
[11:38] but it's not all the way changed yet
[11:40] that's right you still see me as
[11:42] gray-headed and all that but inside of
[11:44] me is that 20-year- old guy what me and
[11:46] dad was talking about the other day we
[11:47] got to understand one thing that one
[11:50] inside of us had better be greater than
[11:53] the one on the outside that's right
[11:55] because right now brother Tom is 84
[11:59] four he's old he's he's he's been over
[12:03] he's having a lot of health problem but
[12:05] inside that man is a 20y old Eternal
[12:09] being with God right and all it's going
[12:13] to take is for that Inside Man to break
[12:16] that shell of the outside man and the
[12:19] ins and the outside man is going to be
[12:21] what changed to a 20-y old person that's
[12:24] right so see we're not going to get in
[12:27] new body so really honestly let's be
[12:29] truthful if you're born again today your
[12:31] Redemption is over your Journey's
[12:35] finished that don't mean we don't have
[12:37] to keep coming to church that don't mean
[12:38] we don't have to keep praying I see that
[12:40] people go on the other side this side of
[12:41] the message that redemption's over we
[12:43] don't need anything so let's go live
[12:45] like we want to we've heard that before
[12:47] right there's this on this side say we
[12:49] don't have anything we got to wait for
[12:50] brother Brown to come back but why don't
[12:52] we just bring them all together and say
[12:53] okay this guy inside of me is done and
[12:55] finished he never did anything wrong
[12:58] right right never right back in eternity
[13:02] he's an eternal person with God that's
[13:04] right but we had to come down in a body
[13:06] of
[13:07] Flesh to
[13:10] prove that that's what it is that's what
[13:13] Jesus Christ did he came to prove that
[13:15] he could live in a human body God God
[13:18] always wanted to live in a human body
[13:20] told you that many times before that's
[13:21] God's plan do what come down on earth
[13:24] have children live in a human body and
[13:26] commune with us and live with us you
[13:28] said how do you know that well that's
[13:30] what we're going to right and God can't
[13:32] change his mind that's right right
[13:34] that's right we just drop down into
[13:35] permissive will to show Satan that we
[13:37] can do it and then we're going to go
[13:40] right back to where the Garden of Eden
[13:42] condition where God can come down in the
[13:43] cool of the day and talk to his children
[13:45] Adam and Eve which is going to be the
[13:47] Bride of Jesus Christ all right any
[13:49] questions on that before we get
[13:52] started brother Brian said as though you
[13:55] never done that's right but we got to
[13:58] realize that that thing inside of us you
[14:01] I don't like to call it a thing but the
[14:02] Bible did did that thing inside of
[14:05] you all right but that thing inside of
[14:07] you we got to realize that God gave us
[14:10] that if you're born again if you're not
[14:12] then we're not even talking to you
[14:13] that's I'm telling you about this seals
[14:15] the seals have got to be revealed to
[14:17] Born Again Christians that are a little
[14:19] bit in the maturity stage that's right
[14:21] okay somebody that really understands
[14:23] and that's what but still though even
[14:26] going through the seals the seals are
[14:27] given for Redemption of the body yet
[14:29] inside those seals is redemption of your
[14:31] soul you can get Born Again by listening
[14:34] to what we're talking about because
[14:35] there's nothing
[14:36] but nothing but one two three four a
[14:41] step remember s Johnny how we I haven't
[14:45] done your chart yet but I think we're
[14:46] going to do it again and put it on the
[14:47] internet since it was it's been watched
[14:50] by a lot of people but the first
[14:53] seal it shows
[14:56] justification this is what I want you to
[14:58] keep keep in your mind second
[15:01] seal sanctification third seal baptism
[15:04] of the Holy Ghost fourth is the word
[15:07] being born inside of you then you go
[15:10] right back to what justification
[15:13] sanctification and there is your highest
[15:15] form of the Holy Ghost right when that
[15:17] Seven Seals open to you that means
[15:18] Christ has come to you as a person right
[15:22] you Lisa
[15:24] Dale as a
[15:27] person this is baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:29] in its highest form so you go through
[15:32] justification what are we talking about
[15:33] now getting rid of our iniquity pretty
[15:35] good start a get
[15:38] start white horse rider what does he do
[15:41] he starts cleaning you
[15:42] out red is always sanctification we're
[15:46] cleansed by the blood and and then then
[15:48] Paul said we're what I Die daily we're
[15:52] cleansed being born again all right
[15:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the
[15:57] black horse rider or death death well
[15:59] that's when you
[16:00] die remember you don't die at
[16:02] justification sure there's Parts there
[16:04] things that go out sanctification
[16:06] unclean Spirit goes out but he don't die
[16:09] because he can come right back right
[16:10] that's right but if you're
[16:12] dead that's death all right then you got
[16:15] what you got all three of
[16:17] these makes the Pale Horse cuz what was
[16:20] the Pale Horse He was white red and
[16:24] black mixed together you mix those three
[16:27] colors and you get that
[16:29] okay you get to pay a horse and that is
[16:31] the word all these mixed together brings
[16:34] the word to you then you start again
[16:36] right back out in
[16:38] justification where you are like Mom
[16:41] said you didn't do it we got to realize
[16:43] that we did we did do it Satan's going
[16:45] to tell you in your brain you did do it
[16:48] for the day that we get changed right
[16:51] but remember if the devil ever talks to
[16:53] you he's a liar that's right he's a liar
[16:57] he may be telling the truth cuz you did
[16:59] do what you did that's
[17:01] right but in God's mind he's a liar
[17:04] that's right inside that man that man
[17:06] inside of you or woman Inside of You
[17:08] person inside of you did not do those
[17:14] things that's why in this age we are the
[17:16] only people that can understand this
[17:18] because in the other ages they've come
[17:19] to a certain level and it was like Paul
[17:21] said I see through a glass Darkly they
[17:23] come to a place and they're like well
[17:26] well you know all the denominations and
[17:27] most of the people in the message think
[17:29] you got to get a new body that God don't
[17:31] have enough his sanctifying blood didn't
[17:33] sanctify us enough but now when see
[17:35] Jesus dropped his blood at Calvary the
[17:38] prophet said it done what
[17:40] Sanctified the Earth that's right see
[17:44] he's coming back the Earth's got to come
[17:45] back in the same process that we do it
[17:48] follows us justification by Noah start
[17:51] with water baptism sanctification Jesus
[17:54] dropped his own blood and what does the
[17:56] blood do it sanctifies you
[17:59] so he cleansed and claimed this whole
[18:02] earth when he was hanging on Calvary
[18:04] that's why we're going to read out of
[18:05] that 53 that's why I love that scripture
[18:06] so much and where was your body your
[18:10] body was in that Earth now but we still
[18:12] had to come through permissive will
[18:13] though we had to come through mom and
[18:14] daddy that's right but he was
[18:16] sanctifying a group of people who his
[18:19] bride his bride hadn't been born yet
[18:22] remember his bride was inside of him
[18:23] that's why they pierced his side
[18:24] remember and the side was open brother
[18:26] Brown said we came out the bride the
[18:28] life came out right Isaiah 53 who ha
[18:32] believed thy
[18:34] report and to whom is the arm or what is
[18:37] the arm word of the Lord
[18:41] reveal where he shall grow up before him
[18:44] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[18:45] dry ground he ha no form no cess and
[18:48] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[18:50] that we should desire
[18:52] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[18:55] man of sorrow acquainted with grief and
[18:58] he hid as it were our face from him we
[19:00] hid as our face from him he was despised
[19:03] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[19:05] borne our griefs and carried our sorrow
[19:09] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[19:11] of God and Afflicted most people that
[19:13] didn't know what was going on thought
[19:15] that he was just a human mortal man
[19:17] which he was but that was God dying for
[19:20] us people that was not just a normal
[19:22] human
[19:24] being but he was wounded for our
[19:27] transgression he was bruised for our
[19:30] iniquity cuz where do you
[19:32] transgress your body where you commit
[19:35] iniquity in your body the chastisement
[19:37] of our peace was upon him and with his
[19:39] stripes we are healed we don't get sick
[19:41] in our soul we get sick in our body yes
[19:44] sir so Jesus come to do two
[19:47] things John said Behold the Lamb of God
[19:51] which was our sacrifice that takes away
[19:53] the sin of the
[19:54] world he had to die in flesh cuz you put
[19:58] a human you put a not a human but you
[20:00] put a lamb up on a on a um fire to
[20:04] commit him as a sacrifice but he was the
[20:07] ultimate sacrifice he was a human lamb
[20:09] all right but then you see the second
[20:11] thing he done which we're going to read
[20:13] right here but the first thing he done
[20:14] he did all those
[20:17] things to clean us up on the outside man
[20:21] but watch
[20:23] this we all we like sheep have gone
[20:26] astray we have turned everyone to his
[20:28] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[20:30] the iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[20:33] Afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he
[20:35] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[20:37] as a sheep before her shears is dumb so
[20:39] he opened not his mouth he was taken
[20:42] from prison and from judgment and who
[20:43] shall declare his
[20:45] generation for he was cut off out of the
[20:48] land of the living
[20:49] now who shall declare his generation
[20:52] Isaiah is asking a question this man if
[20:55] he is going to be the great almighty God
[20:57] and he's going to would be the one
[20:58] that's going to have children and he's
[20:59] the one that's going to live with
[21:01] eternally with all these uh children of
[21:04] his he's
[21:07] dying he's dead in the flesh he's dead
[21:12] who shall declare his what generation
[21:14] his genealogy in other words how is this
[21:16] man going to
[21:18] fulfill this
[21:20] scripture cuz in in the scriptures
[21:23] before it if he takes away your sin
[21:24] takes away your iniquity and he takes
[21:26] your healing gives you your healing
[21:29] Isaiah in his in his mind he was
[21:32] thinking how is this great man going to
[21:33] do it and he's dead or he's
[21:37] dying
[21:39] okay for he was cut off out of the land
[21:42] of the living for the transgression of
[21:45] my
[21:46] people was he stricken and he made his
[21:49] grave with the wicked and with the rich
[21:50] in his death because he had done no
[21:52] violence neither was any deceit in his
[21:54] mouth Isaiah's thinking of a mortal man
[21:57] hanging on a cross there's no way he can
[21:58] procreate because he's dying he didn't
[22:01] have a wife there was no other way for
[22:02] him to get his genes or
[22:05] genealogy to go any further there was no
[22:07] other generation past Jesus Christ as
[22:09] far as what Isaiah could see of this
[22:11] flesh man hanging on the cross cuz I
[22:13] believe Isaiah had a vision okay that's
[22:16] the way brother R said prophets were
[22:17] they had Vision okay God would give them
[22:19] a vision they'd write it down but that's
[22:21] what John did and that's what Isaiah I
[22:22] believe the Old Testament
[22:24] did but Isaiah was looking at a mortal
[22:27] man right
[22:29] he was looking at this great man but he
[22:31] was looking at a mortal man that
[22:32] couldn't procreate that he was dying and
[22:34] his generation was going to be cut off
[22:37] but see he wasn't dying for the he sure
[22:39] he was dying in the flesh for the
[22:40] natural man but the real man he wanted
[22:42] out of was what was inside of him which
[22:44] was the eternal life right cuz I believe
[22:46] it was in in Jesus Christ from the time
[22:48] he was the baby all right cuz remember
[22:50] he was Emanuel God With Us he wasn't
[22:52] just a man walking around and all of a
[22:53] sudden he become God I don't believe
[22:56] that I know you you don't need
[22:59] him and he had made his grave with the
[23:02] wicked and with the rich in his death
[23:03] because he had done no violence neither
[23:05] was any deceit in his mouth yet it
[23:07] pleased the Lord to bruis him he has put
[23:09] him to grief when thou shalt make his
[23:13] soul an offering for
[23:18] sin now sins in the body we can be
[23:20] forgiven sins in the soul we can't be
[23:23] that's right you understand what I'm
[23:24] saying if you're a sinner and you're
[23:26] sinning
[23:29] you're a sinner that's
[23:30] right but if we sin as a Christian we
[23:33] don't sin in our soul if you're born
[23:35] again we sin in our body that's right
[23:37] our spirit Spirit realm we we have sins
[23:39] every day we have bad thoughts things
[23:41] like that but this man right here he
[23:43] made his soul and offering for sin he
[23:45] shall see his seed now what does a seed
[23:47] do a seed is a procreation that's that's
[23:50] the generation isai now he's getting a
[23:53] revelation he's saying oh the soul of
[23:56] this man
[23:59] go back to Genesis 1:26 that was not
[24:03] natural
[24:04] procreation that was spiritual creation
[24:08] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[24:11] spoken word not from the loins of man
[24:14] anymore and this watch what Jesus did he
[24:15] come to show that that not out of the
[24:17] loins of man was was was anybody any
[24:21] good but now the soul
[24:24] see
[24:26] listen shall make his Soul an offering
[24:28] for sin he shall see his seed he shall
[24:30] prolong his days and the pledge of the
[24:31] Lord shall prosper in his hand remember
[24:33] go to Revelation 3:14 Jesus Christ was
[24:35] the what beginning of the creation of
[24:37] God all
[24:40] right he shall see the travail of his
[24:44] soul remember he cried
[24:48] out for forgiveness of the for the
[24:51] people when he was crying out all right
[24:54] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[24:55] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[24:57] shall my righteous servant justify many
[25:01] for he shall bear their
[25:03] iniquities therefore will I divide him a
[25:05] portion with the great and he shall
[25:06] divide the small with the strong because
[25:09] he hath poured out his
[25:10] soul unto
[25:13] death now his soul can't
[25:15] die but his flesh had to die to release
[25:18] that Soul right so it was unto death it
[25:20] wasn't to death it was unto it was going
[25:22] toward it was going to death because you
[25:24] can't kill God right but when God
[25:26] stepped out of that human body guess
[25:28] what human body
[25:29] died simple as that but that was a
[25:32] sacrifice hanging on the cross that was
[25:34] the Lamb of God but the soul was the one
[25:37] that paid the ransom the soul is the one
[25:39] that went to hell to preach to the souls
[25:41] in prison the soul is the one that come
[25:42] back up to paradise and picked up all
[25:44] the people the soul is what came back to
[25:46] you in the New Birth on on the day of
[25:48] Pentecost 120 people were not birthed by
[25:51] their by fleshly Jesus that's right cuz
[25:54] it's not coming back to the Millennium
[25:56] but he sent his soul a ransom
[25:58] a ransom is something you pay that's
[26:00] right somebody steals something or or
[26:03] takes a child you go pay a ransom right
[26:06] to get him
[26:07] back Satan
[26:10] stole this Earth from God just for a
[26:14] little time and then he started on
[26:16] working on you and I that's right right
[26:19] so God is buying them back he's giving
[26:22] an
[26:23] offering and he was numbered with the
[26:25] transgressors and he bare the sin of
[26:26] many and made Obsession for their
[26:28] transgression now if you go back to the
[26:30] sixfold purpose of Daniel we have read
[26:32] the whole six-fold purpose right there
[26:34] in that in that scripture we've also
[26:36] read six
[26:38] seals iniquity sin all these things he
[26:42] give his soul what that's a new birth
[26:45] the soul of God is a new birth amen
[26:47] that's the new birth coming to you and I
[26:48] that was the very soul of God come in
[26:50] brother R said you and him vulcanized
[26:53] you and him in there as persons right a
[26:56] lot of little things brother brand said
[26:57] he said this is my eye God gave it to me
[26:59] what was he saying this is my eye my mom
[27:03] and daddy made it but when God give it
[27:05] to me it's mine right it's not somebody
[27:07] else's so when he gives me the new birth
[27:09] it's not God's anymore it's mine and you
[27:12] can't separate me in that new birth okay
[27:15] same way what he said all those little
[27:17] things that brother R said is it was for
[27:18] a
[27:19] purpose he did not just tell stories to
[27:21] fill up space on a
[27:23] tape didn't I mean he did not and and
[27:27] life stories that we have don't just
[27:29] fill up you know pages in a book or or
[27:32] you know a
[27:35] tape but the breach showed
[27:39] us how it was going to begin how that
[27:42] that God was going to come in human
[27:44] flesh cuz remember
[27:47] remember he didn't just come in human
[27:49] flesh to take away the sin of the world
[27:52] and everybody
[27:53] die he came to find a group of people
[27:56] that was going to believe enough to
[27:58] where they could destroy death while
[28:00] they were here amen I've told you many
[28:02] times before we've got to come back as
[28:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ we just don't
[28:06] come back as a resurrected Jesus Christ
[28:08] we've got to look to where when he said
[28:10] all power in heaven and earth been given
[28:12] unto me where were you and I we were
[28:14] inside of him right in the new birth in
[28:17] the eternal life that when that man
[28:18] raised he raised in a Immortal body
[28:22] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[28:24] an eye he was when he come out of that
[28:27] grave that same man went right back and
[28:28] picked that bruised body up and as soon
[28:31] as that eternal life went right back
[28:32] into that body and raised that body up
[28:34] guess what happened to the body sure he
[28:36] still had the nail scars and and the
[28:38] prince but that's for our sin he was our
[28:41] sin Bearer but he went he didn't come
[28:43] out of that tomb looking like a bruised
[28:45] old man CU Mary remember Mary
[28:49] Magdalene this is the key Mary magdaline
[28:51] did not know Jesus as 20 years old
[28:54] that's right she knew him as a 30
[28:56] something year old man that had been
[28:58] through a couple of years of ministry so
[29:00] he looked kind of old cuz Mary turned
[29:03] around and thought remember the Bible
[29:04] said thought he was the young Gardener
[29:06] that's right right that's right so she
[29:08] heard the voice she heard the voice she
[29:10] heard that voice when that boy said Mary
[29:13] she said my Lord that's why they didn't
[29:15] believe who he
[29:17] was they remember Peter they he appeared
[29:20] to Peter and Peter went fishing the next
[29:21] day if a man raised from the dead that
[29:24] I'd seen die I he wouldn't be out of my
[29:26] sight but they didn't have a revelation
[29:29] they weren't born again Peter was not a
[29:30] born again Christian sure sure Jesus was
[29:34] standing there but he still had to go
[29:36] up and come back down in the spirit to
[29:40] give them a revelation and that's why
[29:42] the 121 went preaching all over the
[29:44] world cuz they saw what had happened and
[29:46] God quickened every bit of that to their
[29:48] heart but that's no different than you
[29:50] and
[29:51] I God giv you a new birth he's going to
[29:54] Quicken you and do the same thing that's
[29:56] right the difference in them and us is
[29:59] they went down remember the Bible say
[30:02] you've lost your first love but in the
[30:04] Sabbath Church age there's no losing of
[30:05] our first love because we are turned
[30:08] back to the first love and we don't go
[30:09] away from it anymore we don't go down we
[30:12] go up that's right all right so when
[30:14] we're going to start we're going to
[30:15] start here next
[30:19] Sunday the word
[30:22] iniquity I ask you to look it up
[30:24] yourself I found a few different ones
[30:26] some this is Verity
[30:29] depravity guilt
[30:31] punishment guilt of
[30:33] iniquity guilt or conscious of our
[30:36] punishment for iniquity or one of these
[30:40] here I have
[30:42] is is like I told you last Sunday is a
[30:45] hideous sin now brother randam
[30:48] definition was is something you know
[30:51] better to do and you do it anyway that's
[30:54] basically the same thing they're telling
[30:55] you here that's the Hideous sin is when
[30:58] you know you're doing it wrong right he
[31:01] said you either do something that you're
[31:02] not supposed to do that's iniquity or
[31:06] this is another one people don't like
[31:08] are you something you should have done
[31:11] and you didn't do that's right
[31:15] right let me quote you a scripture if
[31:18] you think your brother has an odd
[31:20] against you you must go to that brother
[31:23] that's right not wait for him to come to
[31:26] you right
[31:27] and if you know he's got an odd against
[31:29] you you're committing iniquity he's not
[31:32] you are he's got answer for God for what
[31:34] he's thinking about you right but as far
[31:36] as you knowing there's a problem you got
[31:38] to go to that person that's iniquity
[31:40] that's thing want see we're going to
[31:41] really dig into our life now cuz this is
[31:43] going to be life lesson number one first
[31:46] seal
[31:48] iniquity hideous
[31:50] sin you don't ever sin in your
[31:52] soul John the B John the John the
[31:56] Revelator
[31:57] was born again for 60 years how many
[32:00] times did I tell youall that 150 okay
[32:04] this is
[32:05] 151 John the Baptist was John the
[32:09] Revelator that's why I had to tell you
[32:11] that this many times CU they keep saying
[32:12] John the
[32:13] Baptist John the Revelator what do you
[32:17] get
[32:17] over John the
[32:20] Revelator was born again for 60 years
[32:23] remember he he got born again in 833
[32:28] in ad90 he's on the aisle of patmas he's
[32:30] been a born again Christian for 60
[32:34] years and he's crying for
[32:38] Redemption he wasn't crying for
[32:40] redemption in his
[32:42] soul he was crying because there was no
[32:45] man worthy to destroy death in this man
[32:49] right
[32:50] here that's the key people to that
[32:53] Revelations 5 John was weeping cuz it
[32:56] was was no man worthy to change this
[33:01] body that's just the way I believe it
[33:03] because John was born again Christian he
[33:05] didn't need eternal life in his soul
[33:07] he'd been born again for longer than
[33:09] most of us been
[33:10] alive living and saw the master himself
[33:13] and walked with him and laid on Jesus's
[33:15] bosom Jesus's closest friend little
[33:17] young man walking with Jesus Christ but
[33:20] he comes up to the Ale of patmas
[33:23] Revelations 5 and he sees no man Worthy
[33:27] and they
[33:28] was until they saw that lamp come around
[33:31] behind the
[33:33] Altar and then they kept then they they
[33:35] said worthy John saw that that man was
[33:38] worthy to take a body change cu no other
[33:42] man was worthy for that we'll start on
[33:44] iniquity read Isaiah 53 over again and
[33:49] then read Daniel 9
[33:51] 24
[33:53] right
