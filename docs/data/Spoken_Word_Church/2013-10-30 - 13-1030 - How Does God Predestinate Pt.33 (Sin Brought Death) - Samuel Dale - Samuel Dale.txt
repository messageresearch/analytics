holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you you know every day we're getting closer to the time to see him so that's the great thing right we're not backing up one day closer right amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord uh I know that you're all expecting and getting ready for the Saturday Festival where we can all eat together and fellowship and just sit around have a good time laughing and talking about the word of the Lord and make sure you bring you a uh coats and hats and things and a chair because you know we'll be outside if WEA permitting if not we'll all be inside and then we'll have our Bible study at 6:30 it's supposed to be on the pyramids so just uh come and be with us and we'll have a good time and then I know Terrence is unannounced they will be having the chili cook off over here so it worked out good this time instead of us all being here because they they like to use our parking lot and things for their car shows and and uh that was fine also he told me he said well I have been connecting on and listening to some of the service so that's good you know he said when I get to where I I I want to get something good you know something some way I said well I hope you click somewhere else and not here but anyhow so just remember he was having a little trouble this afternoon and we prayed over a prayer cloth and gave it to him to said he'd been having some problems he'll just remember that pray for Danny and Richard they up in the mountains and Richard's trucks quit on him and they've been trying to work on it and the Lord willing we're going to go pull it in tomorrow but maybe they'll get some hunting done the Lord will bless them and everything to take care of them up there on the mountain just remember that now any oh yeah uh remember to pray for my wife the little spot she had on her face here uh they took it off the other day and they told us that it was skin cancer and they want to do some more treatments or something we don't really know what it is yet so let's just pray that everything will be all right no problems it'll be taken care of because believe it that's because you know because that's what he said right remember brother Claude wi singer will be with us here on November the 10th and brother for's mother passed away you know was supposed to be here tonight but uh he will be with us on up into November and preaching for us and be hunting a little bit so remember that I guess that's all the announcements anything else okay yeah a couple of weekends in the third weekend in November the fellowship meeting will be at brother Tony's down at Six Flags so remember that amen father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us this day thank you for all things because we know and realize Lord that none of us are worthy of anything but yet truly you are worthy all praise honor and Glory goes into your your hands Lord from us because without you where would we be father we pray you would come tonight and just speak to your people use the vessel no matter what would be of of benefit of what we could do or whatever Lord and forgive us when we don't speak according to what you want to be said or done and you just have your way we love you and we thank you be with each one of these be with the sick among us you promised it so we believe you we never did read where that we had to do certain things to be able to accept at our receive it all we had to do is believe you so we thank you and we commit it all into your hands now as we read your word you come to speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen okay Romans 8:23 where we've been reading and then we'll go to Genesis 4 Romans 828 through 31 and then we'll go to Genesis 4 and we know that all things work together for good to them that of God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predes whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen can anything thing happening to us without him knowing it cuz remember we're still talking on predestination and we're getting now to the point that I'll probably maybe Sunday make an overall length part of a message and then we will try to get into the uh point of back to our points of predestination and start on the predestinated seed might have another message or so before we get there but that's my full intentions is to try to to get back to our original thought cuz to me this is the thought it's just that we're trying to express how life is upon Earth and how that God knew what would happen all right and I hope you've been following it that he knew what would happen so then it didn't pull anything over on him he didn't have to run around and get another plan he immediately even kill the animals as I was covering last week there this sun past Sunday that he even killed those animals to take the Skins to make an atonement and gave us a bloody we'll repeat that again in a little bit because I love it all right but just think about it you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word and I'll pray in just a second because I got one more scripture so go ahead and be seated James 1 and 15 says cuz this will go into our thought of where we're going then when lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word because that's our prayer always in him all right now we've been as I was saying we've been covering the the beginning and I hope you're catching on to the point of seeing that when the beginning started on Earth and you know beings and whatever then God's predestinated plan would begin to come into view all right and it and it's it's that we'll we'll get to a couple of quotes that we got where brother Brown said it was necessary for his predestinated plan for you know to bring things into view even the loss the the conditions ET Etc but he couldn't make it that's right he could not make it and be just but he could know it and be just right that's my whole point of trying to get to of Adam and Eve he knew what would happen all right and and then knowing what would happen then he could predestinate now now follow this and then we'll get on to our thought he could predestinate that atonement eternally cuz see we're going to get to it one of these days you know about a predestinated seed predestinated eternally right all right now but he could predestinate what it would take to to uh cover mankind right see he had to predestinate that because he knew what was going to happen when we got here right all right and see then he could predetermine it this is not no casual thing of just well you know the sin come then God just decided to do something else about it you know and no no he knew before the world what he was going to do and he predetermined that to be cuz I believe in a predestinated eternal seed amen I do but maybe not the way a lot of people believe it you know but we'll get down to those things and try to bring it into but James says that When sin is finished it brings death amen all right now so we've been trying to cover what the original sin is what unbelief all right that's that's something that everybody should be able to follow no matter what or what church you'd be in you would be able to follow it that way see Eve believed the devil's lie about what God had said right now I'm hoping that dwells in our heart and our lie it wasn't the devil coming up with some new plan you know some new thing that wouldn't have worked with Eve but he went straight to the word of what she understood and he began to not to try to destroy that but to uh would you say interpret or misinterpret either way you want to place it that he would start really the way I look at it he he was trying his best to to get Eve not away from God as the prophet said but he wanted her to doubt God's word or now think about it and you'll see why did it happen as this the devil you know says God knows in the day you eat thereof uh you become as Gods you know knowing good and evil etc etc what was he doing he was trying to tell her okay we we've heard this we know that but surely remember one we gave the prophet said surely God knows he loves you and he wouldn't kill you you know he loves you you're part of his predestinated plan well that can be true but it's according to how you approach it all right now get into the thought for tonight see there's always um like I've always said about it you you you you uh you take Sin Sin being unbelief all right we know that and believe it but there's always a display there's never just something that you're doubting something there's always a display of that there's always an attribute right and we get to it in a minute we know the quotes but it's right in where I want to read from that see sin being unbelief was in the reasoning factors of Eve the second realm of her being whether you want to call it Soul or where you want to call it Spirit just remember it's in the reason memory conscious affections and in that realm he begin to get her to doubt now now think about what I'm saying was it to doubt as much God's word or to doubt that God wouldn't keep his word right now I gave you where the Prophet said she failed on Hebrews 13:8 right that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever well now that's not just to saying letters of a word amen for us to believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever means that we got to believe that same God you got a lot to be involved in it but really was he trying to get her to disbelieve God or to doubt that he would keep his word amen wouldn't it be a convincing argument to be maybe standing there listening and and Eve that Beast talking to Eve and said now you know he loves you I gave you the quote from the prophets you know he loves you he cares for you he knows what you're going to do and you're going what if it happened this way what if he said and you're going to help him fulfill his predestinated plan come on cuz that's what took place right you can't deny that can you right what if he explained a lot of things to her I don't think it was a f minute conversation you know it could have been days and days and weeks and months of exp explaining to her the great things and got her to doubt God's word or God keeping his word now what about you and I all right now do we doubt God as being God do we doubt him as being real no no the devil don't try he he the devil never tries anymore now he used to come on we all come through it right he used to when I started studying of the one God he try to tell me other fallacies and and thoughts and ideas and opinions and etc etc but see he doesn't do that anymore it's unsettled he can't even approach the idea of a trinity into our minds now all right so we wouldn't even listen to him but what about the deception in the last days through the people of the message that say well now he's God here but he's not God over here our are you know two Lords seven un virtues what about all those doctrines and and even saying that he was not god Till The River Jordan then he became God then he lost his godship then he died now come on I'm not thr off on nobody I'm just telling you amen that's what we believe see and we can take those things into our being and not realize I've talked to a lot of people and express a little about the the two Soul Doctrine and I've had them to tell me so well you know I used to believe that sure well the truth is the only thing that's going to take out what we don't right amen believe all right now brother Mo years ago I remember this came back to me today and I was thinking I remember him preaching a message which he and I discussed it at length he said brother Dale if we ever understand what death really is he said then and only then can we think about conquering it that's right that's right boy that's a you know let that ring into you well you man stand death you die you buried you're gone that ain't the end of you that's right it just takes you out of this existence amen you go into another existence and have to remain until even if you're a sinner to be judged and Etc but you know I've always thought on that point when you find out what death really is then we can talk about conquering it we should be to the place that we wouldn't worry about death because we know that death is only an ability to carry us into the arms of our Lord and savior amen righten all right but yet what's keeping us here see that's the point I want to deal with tonight if you're in the message you watch it what's keeping us here is sin now not as drinking gambling smoking running around women if if that's a problem we already dead don't worry about it that ain't no hopes for that those are only the attributes of unbelief all right we see unbelief is original sin and unbelief is original death and when unbelief is destroyed death will have to go with it come on when unbelief is gone yeah but I just don't know because I have so much unbelief what unbelief do you have I mean you believe in the Trinity well get rid of it you doubt whether the word of God is true by now after what 40 years for some of us and more than that of studying the message now sin is unbelief amen and sin notice what James said when it's finished right amen it brings forth death amen it's like I said the other day where that Eve see when it says the day you eat thereof that day you die well they partook the next day she said Adam I told you God wouldn't going to keep his word because we're supposed to died yesterday they died in A Thousand Years cuz thousand years is a day and the day is a thousand years God was right right but what was their interpretation of that thought I told you that we wouldn't die and we didn't but they was out of the garden too where were they I want to get over to that about Cain being put out of the presence of the Lord but I hold that but think about it remember sin being unbelief and not sin as unbelief like I don't don't believe God and the Bible said he that believeth not is condemned already all right I I don't believe that that's not what I'm talking about Satan can't approach you with trying to get you to believe in another God truly right now I mean the youngest ones Among Us would would argue that point with the devil but yet all he's got to do is to get us to one thing to think that we're not worthy and you know what I agree with him before he ever says it I'll tell him ain't worthy but yet God said I was right amen so I don't have to worry about it right amen I'm going to take what he says amen there was only one sin I was looking at those things but decided not to go that way so much but you know the Bible says there's only one sin under death and Peter or Paul or there one of them said that that's that's the one I tell you you don't have to pray for you know you don't pray for that sin on death why that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost attributing The Works of God to the devil you know in the things but every other sin you pray for but brother Dale I'm a Christian I don't have no sin your Prophet said he sinned every day your Prophet said sins all Christians have sins all right well I just don't don't believe that well you're an unbeliever all right so you're condemned already see watch that as we go through the message now but remember everything has to start with an unbelief but it's easy to hide now I'm not talking about from God I'm talking about us from each other it's easy to hide your unbelief you can sit right there and me preaching on one God after all these years been preaching you can sit right there and say don't believe that well ain't nothing I can do about it cuz I don't know you're thinking that you know but when it comes from a unbelief into an outward act see then I begin to have something I can look at you know all right and you know what that means by a lot of people I don't believe what you preach and they just get to walk out the door right yeah that's a pretty good attribute but it's all right cuz I've never said anybody left here left the word right amen CU that ain't between me and them that's between them and God Amen all right but now think about it Satan does not try to get us to turn against God but he tries to get us to doubt that word as for being for us come on he don't talk to you like that I read something brother brandom says and he says the bride will or the the Bible would say the world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and you know I say Satan God said that but you know what he do well where's it I you know right if we had the word here like we think we have the word here how many times have that been said then it'd be great things taking place I don't try to justify nothing cuz I see great things taking place we've seen the dead raised the sick heal we've seen all kind of things so we don't have to worry about it right but I don't try to justify nothing but I will tell you the truth there's no need of praying for rain in a monso season that's right then what do you mean by that that's what I just mean God is among us but the prophet said he would try this bride to see whether she would fail for Satan's lie well he can't try if he don't pour on the pressure sister asked me to look it up and I got one in there in the office where brother R said you better get used to cold weather cuz they got some places up in Alaska well that's on the internet course that's been 20 30 years ago that they've been talking about that a lot of the brothers used to be here talked about it you know all of these concentration camps in America and all who's worried they can't get us until God gets to with us wouldn't it be nice if we was all put in one place right amen might be a lot of knock down drag out fights but still be better than what we exist and has right we could at least argue and not have to go home you know we'd have plenty of time to discuss what we wanted to discuss that's why I don't worry about it I'm concerned with the one thing that's killing all of us unbelief all right now I've got it in here a time or two to say see a lot of times unbelief is because of lack of understanding right amen right amen lack of understanding leads us in unbelief or lack of understanding you know I'm Southern far sorry folks a lot of people haven't heard this message right and they've not heard it taught to them correctly right amen and see that leads them in unbelief the Bible speaks of it there said you stand in the door talking about the preachers you stand in the door and won't go in and won't let the people go in either right all right unbelief is not always displayed by drinking gambling smoking and that's where I've tried my best to explain it and get into trouble about it a born again Christian cannot disbelieve in their soul right there is no way can be done their inner being Center being what do you want to call it Spirit where you want to call it Soul the center being has only one Faith one thing Faith or doubt so I've tried to explain that that inward part of us called reason memory conscious affection thing there's where the unbelief comes in out am all right because if we sin from our soul we're dead right well how many people wants to hear it like that but think about it now is God trying to get us to turn against even this message I said this what 20 years ago I said you give enough time and I said this will be one of the biggest Cults there ever is and I said it'll be no count how many followers well you look at them now they say there's over a million in Africa alone but I thought the Bible said if Fe not little flock well okay if it was two millions over 5 millions of us believe in it that' still be a small flock compared to 700 billion people in the world all right but you see folks I'm trying to get us to see what's killing us it's not the food we eat sure we know that are we breed sure we know that the water we drink sure we know that but you going to quit drinking you going to quit eating come on you read where one day read one man said sleeps to Too Much sleep's killing you then read another one said not enough sleep's killing you well we ain't worried about sleep it's unbelief unbelief about this message you say well now I I believe everything the prophet says all right but now think about it there's got to be a display of the unbelief and that the prophet would call like paragraph 87 we won't have to get that in brother Joe we'll read it in a minute but drinking gambling smoking the prophet said is not unbelief he said that's an attribute of unbelief or a display right a display a display you can see thought you can't right all right I've went through many things in the past few weeks talking about about how that Satan has attacked the minds of the people to get us to doubt the message as being true amen outside world is not attacking us they don't even know how right that's right amen right but it's right Among Us amen doctrines and ideas all right what about what we were talking about last Sunday when I ask you the question do you believe Cain could have been saved do you know there a lot of people in the message I've heard that over and over ever since I've been in the message that Cain couldn't been saved he serpent seat no serface seed can't be saved but brother brandom I gave it to you off the power of transformation he said came knew the perfect will of God now listen to what he's saying if you want to pull it pull that go and pull it up let them read it brother Joe can you the perfect will of God Brother Anderson I guess it back there I don't know who's on the pole a lot of time but he refused to do it yeah now we put a lot of emphasis listen to this as we're on it we put a lot of emphasis on the difference between Cain and Abel that Abel had a revelation and I agree with that but Cain knew what was right but he wouldn't do it that's right so he knew now let's read the prophet then he can knew the perfect will of God he knew the perfect will of God can't knew it why but he refused to do it he proved then to be the Serpent's Seed when he seen the perfect will of God he refused it watch he had seen God vindicate Abel's message he know that was the will of God now irregardless of what of any thought look at the situation you lay something down I lay something down God consumes your offering that what he done with Elijah and all those prophets and things he consumed the offering and he'd leave M land there well I ought to have enough sense to realize right that there's something wrong with what I done that's right that's right but I won't get to it today I want leave you a little time but I I wish I knew we had these I had one or two written down in my Bible cuz you know how I keep things been doing it for 50 years now about what the prophet said and write it in my Bible where I keep up with it brother Brown said Cain said this is all I'm going to do he said you take it or leave it I wish when you get home cuz it won't bother me reading what I'll read I wish when you get home you'd run in the computer take it or leave it and see how many times R around spoke about that and how many times it applies to you and I I built churches I I go to church I'm in church all the time I worship he said that's telling God take it or leave it okay he know that was the will of God he seen God vindicate Abel's message and what did God say to him he just said do the same do worship like your brother and you'll do well but you see he seen the perfect will of God but he didn't want it see amen he wanted to add something to it right y do like your brother look at the next one power transformation that's on U power trans next one is God's power transformation look what he says he's coming down to Genesis 4 and 6 and 7 God said to Cain said why are your countenance Fallen why are you all full of temper walking around you just heard a message that upsets you listen to brother BR said well what are you doing that far why are your countenance fail because I didn't come into your church so why did you do it are you using a thinking man's filter why or or why why are you looking like that said if you'll do well go do like your brother is doing out there I'll receive you and bless you now I wrote it like this for you and I to say after we read this that Cain could not be saved you realize we are in unbelief that's right because your Prophet said it and I gave you the other quotes Sunday on it more than just that yeah but that's my idea about it what are you saying God I've done all I'm going to do take it or leave it brother rold said Cain knew the perfect will of God but he wouldn't do it and said take it or leave it what I've offered take it or leave it you said I wouldn't D do that like my mom used to say she said I born to baptist that I'll probably die one well I love my mother and I hope she'll be there but she made her own judgment I don't have to make nothing for her if God wants me to hear the word he'll send it how many said that he'll send it to the church I mean that's in the message I've had that in my face not for me to try to invite people to come to this church but for them to let me know what they were doing if God wants me to hear it he'll send it to down to my church you don't quote from Brother Bram God's obligated is that a quote God is obligated to put somebody on the pull pit let him send it down to my church but they don't read the others said if your pastor won't stay with the word you get away from your pastor then it don't read them take it or leave it is that what we're saying now all right I try to be sensible you said but brother Dale all people don't have the ability to find the quotes Etc of the Prophet like we do I agree with that that's 100 I agree with that I covered it just a second ago because a lot of times this lack of unbelief is unbelief is a lack of understanding and I know that and God knows that but let me just ask you because this is the way I think I write down the thoughts and this is the way I think I said you say but all people don't have the ability to find the quote of the Prophet like we do that may be true but they have the ability to think that Cain could not be saved where'd he get that from are you read listening to what I said I'm reading to you what I wrote down they don't have the ability but they have the ability to think that Cain could not be saved right where'd he get it from preachers right why would we think any way whatsoever that God would not save Cain do we think we are some special he wouldn't save Cain but yet he'll save me that means you think you're something special but are you listening somebody might not have the ability to quote the it right but they get the ability from somewhere to believe a lie why not search for the truth well I'm afraid brother Dale I might get confused don't worry about it honey you already confused don't be concerned about getting confused that means what you're saying is I don't want to hear more truth can I quote it sister Gil when she told Brother dick said don't tell me no more and I won't be responsible right come on don't you I'm not picking on her cuz every one of us done the same thing right the same thing we all to listen but don't we believe that God would save everybody right if they'd want to be saved you mean it's God's will for some to be lost son to be saved no he would at all be saved that's right right well then why would we come up with a Doctrine see it's an unbelief well see I'm pretty sure probably on the internet Sunday or theight one click it went all I don't agree with what he's are saying you see I can't do anything about that I wish I could but maybe I could find a better way and somebody give me a better education I guess to be able to put my words together beautiful I'm sorry see unbelief brought sin or is sin and sin brings death look at what the prophet of God said in page 66 of the church age book The Ephesian Church age number four he said just to change one word bring sin and death just to change one word look the scripture he going down through other reading if anybody adds to anybody takes from one word all it takes and as I said even I was given it about that God killed the animals but my God can't kill he's a Spirit Well the Bible said he did the prophet said he did I gave it to you there last week paragraph E36 with the way have Fellowship 1955 109 brother R said he set forth a bloody Plan of Redemption he killed the animals we'll get to that in a minute that God was the first one the first death in the garden was not Cain and Abel the first death in the garden was the animals that were sacrificed but see the first death that would be starting the serpent seed would be unbelief that's what's killing us unbelief and brother R said we was born between Eve and the serpent no bless God I born my mom and daddy the prophet said was born between Eve and the serpent right next time you see a snake say hello Daddy no they're not that way right cuz we don't believe that way we believe the Beast was used right but see the first death was death in the spiritual realm of Eve and Adam in their reasoning memory of conscious affections and then God had had to kill the animals y because he knew that death was the only way why didn't he just go down if he say well it's going to be a blood doctor it's going to be a blood why didn't he just go down draw out a little blood and go over to Adam and Eve and go come on no because you remember what the quote we gave you the prophet said the animal was used the Beast was used to pregnate the human race right he said thereby the animal would have to be the atonement then spiritual death brought the death of the animals to make an atonement that's an attribute right spiritual death was unbelief right the natural death was the animals being killed that was an attribute or a display oh God it's so great why did God just say oh I see I see the blood I see the blood no no no no no what are we saying when I see the blood all pass over you not if I think about it all right but see then it went on from there until Genesis 4 and8 Cain actually killed Abel so sin brought death right all death comes starting from unbelief the seed of the serpent unbelief wound up into death physically do you understand what I'm getting at all comes because of unbelief but as I said I want to deal with what is death and see how that death is still following you and I right amen right death is still following us you said what brother Dale why why are we sick it's not because we don't believe in God right that's not what it is that's the fall that's the condition the existence that was brought into being because of the unbelief right but Cain killed Abel an attribute took place a literal happening took place God killed those animals a literal happening took place I don't like you to talk about my God being a killer well I'd invite you to go home take your computer and type in God killed I we should just go on take a computer type it in you on internet type it in cut me off type it in and see what it says come back later and look where your Prophet said God killed Jesus Jesus God killed the lamb you see we do have the ability to study out things but have we run out of the ground we know that in the garden now the sin of unbelief then was displayed by an attri into Eve the Beast Adam Etc and it put them into a bad situation which would be attributes Sara and childbearing U Adam would be your ruler you know the husband would be the ruler Adam would have to work sweat of his brow uh you know things would grow up the ground wouldn't wouldn't do correctly and all things it brought a lot of things but what I want you to think about for a little bit is about Adam and Eve and you'll see why I'm driving it just so much and what I'm driving it is to show you and I what the devil can do with quotes he can kill you with them amen he's done it with the Bible all the years none good no not one next sermon be therefore perfect your father in Heaven is perfect couldn't get it together sa by faith save by works couldn't get it together what about what happened to Adam and Eve and you'll catch on a little bit more what I'm talking about go ahead brother and pull it up but let's start in this this will be taken off the breach which will start paragraph 87 number six of you notes there and that's why I said I wouldn't read that while ago because we'd have to come down to it anyway this is paragraph 887 through about 90 something of the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven seals 1963 317 e just before the seals broke in case you want to say this before go ahead that's death too now we say sin we just call it sin break it down what is sin a lot of people say drinking committing adultery no that's the attributes of sin see that's what sin causes see but real Sin is unbelief that's where that's where it's named and called out if you you are a Believer you don't do those things but no matter how holy you try to make yourself and how religious you try to be if you do those things you're an unbeliever that's scripture he said not scriptural now something is something's lost and it's groaning it's trying to get back to be to be back to its original condition would you imagine someone falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and was struggling climbing buing they must by some means get out of this pit they're not in their original state and frantically they're screaming they're clawing the walls making a noise or doing some way they're they're groaning because that they want to get back to the original state all right and when a person is struck by diseases aches and pains one time that wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong and they're groaning and trying to get back to where they was when they had health and when Nature and people as the Bible said are groaning it shows there something that they're not in their ought to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere now watch now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the Fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death a tree never died before Adam an animal Wouldn't Die before Adam and there's only one thing that cannot die and that's God because he's Eternal and that's the only way we can get keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be sons and and Daughters of God but when we when when but when we died as I said in the message this morning to sin and sold out our Birthright cross this Chasm now we're beyond the reach of God on this side on this other side of the chasm now of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation and he was given free moral agency it was given he them just as we so to make a choice now brother Brown said Adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden got a quote what do you think about it so I'm trying to show you something and show you how that we use the message for what we desire but Brother D you just read Adam fell to death he fell from eternal life now why would he say that when just a few months prior to then on Blasphemous names he said that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam eternal life now go ahead we'll read that just to make sure where anybody on the internet and things can can read it then we'll get back to her thought what I'm saying things that look so contradictory generally has a simple sensible understanding but it takes a simple sensible understanding and then let it be revealed now I I'm saying this so that you'll think about it and the reason I read that Cain knew the perfect will of God but wouldn't do it was to lay it down that tonight that I can say these two things it looks totally contrary and then make a sensible answer and let's see what you'll do with it internet people whatever see what you'll do with it try to show you the perfect will of God let's see what you do with it we just read that Adam fell from eternal life to death right now look what he says from blasphemian 9 he's preached 11:04 in the morning and this was the three so it's about 4 five months somewhere in four months he's talking about the soul and what the things are and how that people breathe this and they breathe you take the scripture from back there and God breathed breath into his nostrils and he became a living soul and see he's explaining absolutely the things watch now I want to ask you something back come back down okay if he was a man what kind of breath was he breathing before God breathed the breath of eternal life into him now you can take that right there and you can argue either way you want to with that quote but remember my understanding okay no problem I believe Adam was created Body Spirit and soul Adam all right if he had been created body and spirit and then God just put his life in there there wouldn't have been Adam that would have been Jesus because that's what happened with Jesus amen So Adam was created Body Spirit and soul then God breathed into his nostrils now you can argue that quote back as Force go ahead and argue how you want to he said I think he said well go ahead you got a right to think according to the Constitution but what if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed his breath of life into him see what kind of a breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul see you you can argue the point backwards and forth because they breathe human soul and our soul and all together because see that's the African way of you breathing out and breathing in that's not talking about what God makes you then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice would have been sufficiency so brother the argument don't stand now but God did roll it on up what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he we know who he talking about Adam right then he became a living Soul a soul that can't die now watch now we're going to get into honey plumed her elbows not notice breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul because God breathed not what nature done but what now what's nature done nature gives us we know it comes from God but we call it nature gives us you know life Etc all right not what nature done but what God God did breathe the breath of life into his nostrils and he became a living Soul then you say to me Adam died brother brandom watch but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah those who forew he has called he had a lamb to redeem them he was a top Adam fell then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the Eternal God and he had become a living Soul he was a Son of God not his breath as Africa word I don't know what the Greek word is for and all but the African word means a more your animals breathe a more your all right then why would we struggle pull it on up why would we struggle for eternal life if you just breathe it in and out let me ask another thing if it's like everybody in the message says we come here with eternal life already in us why would we search for eternal life amen I like questions right watch them questions their gender Strife heyen for The Strife why there must needs be heres among you that they that are approved may be made manifest come on let's quote a lot of scripture all right but look what happened why would we struggle for eternal life if it's just what you breathe it backfire brother you can't do it but God specially lip on Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he was an amateur God he was a god of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the earth and someday these sons of God will again become Gods all right now why would a prophet say here in Blasphemous names that God breathed into Adam's nostril eternal life and he became an eternal person with God then he gets over in the seal book and says or the breach and says Adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden now if those two don't come together you're going to have to show me where he corrected it or said he was wrong over here and right over here and whatever you know oh of course Brother D that's progress pressive Revelation those were 62 and this is 63 that's Progressive well let's go backwards forwards and just find out something let's just ask the prophet a question is God an Indian giver the prophet says no is not number eight paragraph 55 of Hebrews chapter 6 you'll make mistakes you'll fall you willfully do wrong I've heard that preached over and over to True Christian can't willfully do wrong the prophet said we can so that settles out you'll go out sometime and do things that don't mean that you're lost that means you going want to get correction like his little boy says you know what to expect when they do it they're going to get a whipping for it sometime sometimes a good one but it's still your children it's impossible for that man to ever be gone again it's impossible for you to ever be gone again what if you're saved that's once been born of eternal life God is not an ending Giver he that heareth my words and believeth on me as everlasting life never come into the Judgment pass from death into life that's God's promise is God an ending giver no he's not an ending giver than you no look the next one number nine paragraph 145 questions and answerers 61115 morning service he's talking about Saul a man telling him that Saul was lost all right go back and read above and everything he's telling him Saul was lost he said well Saul could not be saved if you become an enemy of God you remember the scripture said you become an enemy of God but you don't go on to the rest of it where that Samuel told Saul said tomorrow you and I going to be together well everywhere Saul is that's where Samuel is are the Bibles wrong somewhere right I said Saul was saved oh he said I said he was a prophet he had to be saved God saved him now I want to get on that predestinated gifts one of these days you'll find out about them prophets and things all God's not an ending Giver as we call it you know well if God gave you the Holy Ghost knowing that he's going to lose you right down here why what a foolish thing it would be for him to give you the holy ghost in the first place God's not an Indian giver God's not an Indian Giver so why would a prophet say that Adam received eternal life and if you want some more we'll be glad to read it and find some more you know but then turn around and say that Adam fail from eternal life what actually happened in the garden to Adam and Eve first off Adam body and Eve's body was not Eternal you agree Amen brother brandham says on the message the future home paragraph 431 432 that his youth was continually going on he was not his body was not Eternal so what happened to Adam why would a prophet say he fell from ET life all right death brought sin brought death to the body according to Genesis 3:22 let's put them out of the garden L they partake of the tree of life and live forever it didn't say Eternal it said forever all right cuz Adam's Body was not Eternal Adam's body is in the ground right of course you can believe Adam come up in the resurrection do whatever I do too not exactly like a lot of people do but I believe it too but I believe what the prophet said to one of these days Adam will reach over and Shake Eve and Eve will reach over and shake shake Abel and Abel will reach over and Shake Seth and up will come to Resurrection I believe that too all right now I believe that whatever thing Adam lost that Jesus Christ is going to restore amen that's right I believe like the prophet said said he proved he's going to restore it but says cause he stood right there created walked on water he done all kind of things but back to the point now if Adam had eternal life in his soul and was an eternal person with God then what is the prophet talking about when he said that Adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden look like contradictory doesn't it well which one do you want well I'll take the one after I'll take four but you see most of you that been around here a long time you've heard me preach this for about 40 years and it's exactly right brother RS right in both places right amen as brother RS right exactly in Blasphemous names when he breathed into Adam's nostrils and he become an eternal person with God but he's exactly right over in the seal book when he said Adam fell from eternal life amen that's right to death now show me where that he ever said Adam fell from eternal life and went to hell I want to quote no way I've studied it 40 some years you ain't going to find it help yourself searching you might find a lot of other good things but you see a simple form or illustration is all it takes Adam never reached eternal life in body that's right because of the Fall he fell from that place and he died amen so he fell to death in the garden he fell from living eternally in Body Spirit and soul you see church because I can look right at it and stand here and talk to you about it that you and I have eternal life and our soul but our body and spirit is not Eternal amen and we're still in that Fallen condition but I can say what Adam lost Jesus restored am he proved it amen he died come on Jesus died he went to hell he was raised back up but to God in him didn't die amen that's right and only released the ability by death of the body we call Jesus for him to be able to finish the Plan of Redemption or the ways and he went to hell for you and I and his soul right and he preached to the spirits that were in prison then he comes back up and picked up the Old Testament Saints right right and then he came back up and picked up his own body amen so Jesus the body died am but he never fail from eternal life right cuz the Bible had already said I'll not leave my soul in hell and see my Holy One reap corruption what don't should apply that to you and I amen he's done been to Hell For Us amen paid the price we don't have to go amen we don't have to do none of that he'll not leave my soul even in Paradise as we call it is taken up in the New Testament he's not going to just even leave it there an eternal condition existing of brother Brandon beyond the curtain of time he's not going to leave it there why because brother of Brown's Body was on Earth the Lord Jesus was down paying the price and preaching to the lost his body was in the grave dead y but it was raised up am Adam never lost eternal life and went to hell because if he lost eternal life where would he be going don't think I don't think you say well what it was and Adam died back there but Jesus Paid the price and then he could come back up and live just remember Adam had eternal life in his soul he was the example son that God wants you and I to be and then death has no problems over me no sting no troubles it's my master can't take me to God gets through with me but I hope you understand what I'm getting at Adam fell from the position that he should have went on into total eternal life but Body Spirit Soul everything would went right on in and the fall not come but because of the fall and the death it brought it throwed you and I into this condition that we exist in that even though we have eternal life in our soul in our body and our spirit is still Satan's domain that he can do everything so he didn't fall to death like death like hell or gone he just never achieved the place that it should have been should have been that's right amen if I die today I've always told my wife I said you don't have to worry about me anyway I said just take my old body out and throw it off on the side of the road let it rotten CU was it matter I said I want have to dig my way out of the grave who worries about it she said you ain't going to have nothing to do with it cuz you'll be gone well all right but if I die today don't say I died that's what I'm talking about death see we talk about death as being where you just breathe that last breath and you're gone it was a little girl one time or a child no let's get it right there was a man named Nicodemus that had died and his soul had left his body the prophet even one time said maybe four days out there somewhere you know where is it Lazarus let me get my Nam right okay thank you and Jesus was trying to explain to them disciples and he says Lazarus sleepeth and they said well great he's resting he'll be better what's the best thing for sickness rest what do the doctor tell you go home and rest let the body work itself you know so finally he gets around to it and he says now listen Brothers I'm trying to tell you without it being so sarcastically a wrong way but Lazarus is dead but I'm going to go wake him because he ain't dead like dead like separated like dead dead dead cuz that don't even happen to a sinner when a sinner dies he got a place to go to I said I'm going to go wake him brother Brown said when he stood there he said maybe that body that Soul was out three or 4 days or whatever he said he simply just called it back amen what if you had a choice like some people did one time when their child had died don't up in age a little bit they come to brother brandham to ask him about it y he said 'I searched the reals of the lost and said I can't find him said thereby must be in the Realms of the just said now if you want me to I can call him back they said no if that's where he's at let him stay there amen yeah wouldn't that be something see death we think is just dying it's just well l a poor old brother you know he's dead you ain't even there if you ever walk through like that and walk and look down in my casket just look over in the corner and I'll wave at you you said that's silly it's not silly it's truth brother BR said he let them saints look over the banister sometime see what's going on see we don't make it real the Bible says The Last Enemy to be destroyed is what death death and hell is cast into what lake a fire which is the second death death we better worry about that death I ain't concerned about getting killed or dying what is death we keep on dying I was thinking about it today I thought well Lord you know what if you don't come pretty quick death's going to take a bunch of us cuz that's just natural I mean it's natural a lot of us is the 70s you know and he you know I mean you ain't promised much more that's as far as you promised I done reach that goal I'm on bar time some of you bared a whole lot more time than I've bared but who worries about dying but if we can find that out what death really is and it all ties to the unbelief we can conquer it that's these brothers in karate that's little Zach back there in Kate they teach you to have no limitations in your mind because if you got limitations in your mind you limit the body come on I told you the guy that broke the water first 4 minute do I get that right 4 minute mile he was an invalid at Birth or whatever he was he couldn't even run but you know what they just forgot to tell him and he got to walking and he got to run and and they forgot to tell him he couldn't break that 4minute mile you know what he did he broke it the prophet said we'll just walk right through death that's what the scripture says death is my helper or whatever you want to call it I'm his master until God gets to with me then who wouldn't want to go you know but we stay here for one another right you know what I'm talking about you look at somebody and they'll be doing pretty good and even in the natural and they'll be doing all right maybe the husband dies and like Brother Gary he's listening in his who was his mom died there his daddy died daddy died one Saturday the next Saturday she he died she just didn't want to live sister Tatum passed on and brother Tatum just never did talk no more about wanting to live he talked about going on over being with her amen right talk to the nurses is that the way it is talk to the doctors the first thing is try to get you to believe because if we can believe we can conquer death let's stand come on Brothers sin brought death but belief will bring life I all things are possible what we say with God but that ain't what the scripture says scripture said all things are possible to them that believe we want to see death destroyed Just Keep On Believing God's word right right that's right you tell me what else I can do if shouting or do it we'll start an oldfashioned shouting real everybody comes in the door you eat a shout we whoop you which one's it going to be no I'm not against it I love it amen but I know they ain't but one thing can conquer death and that's God's word God's word you say no he conquered it that's what his word says that he conquered it what we got brother 381 the red book 381 the red book
