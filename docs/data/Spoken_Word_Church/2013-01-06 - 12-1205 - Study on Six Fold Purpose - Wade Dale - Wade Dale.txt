========================================

oh me stop closer is oh oh is me in moments like these amen in moments like these i lift up up love you oh is i love you see open i want to see shining in the light of your glory for out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy good to be in the house of the lord couldn't have any have each and every one of you with us brother richard back from his trek to arizona you can get suntan so he must not have stayed out in the sun too long always good to come back no place like home right no place like home you got your bibles go ahead and turn to daniel 9 we're gonna try to continue our thought on the study on the six fold purpose and we're gonna kind of take a little different angle as far as going into the sixth seal we covered last time we covered the seals in the six-fold purpose and we're going to kind of intertwine what brother dale's been preaching the past few services and just kind of interject a few things that that we saw that that may help you so remember me i know parents told you this weekend that uh that uh we're going i'm going out to brother claude's uh just keep him in your prayers i mean he's he doesn't have any help out there he doesn't uh doesn't even have a qualified deacon so he really doesn't have anybody to uh to kind of take over and while he's uh sick plus he needs some everybody needs some skin physical support phone phones okay and this is okay and that's okay but sometimes you just like to be there it's kind of like being there with sterling at the in the hospital last sunday and just said a simple prayer and brother aaron and myself and and i just told them according to mark 16 it says lay hands on the seat and they shall recover we're going to take that commission and we're going to apply and when you apply that commission you just leave he has nothing else to do you just forget about the symptoms i mean he was throwing up i mean we saw in a cup he was throwing up big clots of blood huge clots of blood but pretty good size enough to make you worry but then to hear that he came home the next day we know that that god was there and we gave him all the praise so we're going to take a prayer cloth to brother claude so we're at the end of the service remind me if i forget i've got a big note here but sometimes you overlook these things but we're going to all as a church pray because he really thinks a lot of each and every one of you and we all thank a lot of the big guy out there too so it's just just tough for him to be uh started with pneumonia they sent us a text last night and said he was had pneumonia and that they were going to take him to the hospital because his blood pressure was 200 over 83 and then when they got into the hospital they found out he had a urinary tract infection and he couldn't he couldn't eliminate any fluids and being a diabetic they really were concerned because he couldn't get any fluid off so now they've they've uh done a catheter so they're going to keep him he's going to be stuck there two or three days at least two days they said and uh they've they're testing him for congestive heart failure and prostate trouble so just keep him in your prayers and just remember that um that we're going to be traveling um brother benny is going to give us a plane flight i just talked to him a few minutes ago and he's going to get us a real cheap plane flight so it's not going to cost a lot to get out there so just keep him in your prayers and keep us in your prayers because it'll be a pretty short visit but we're going to try to leave out friday evening and get back on monday but it's just something that i want to do because he's a good friend of mine and i hope you all understand that i won't be here for the uh christmas dinner so um somebody'll have to step up parents can step up and take over all the all the giving outs and stuff and he's he's well capable to do that also remember i brother tim and sister esther's doing great they've sent me several uh text messages and and a few pictures of of their honeymoon so it all went well he's doing good she's doing good so just keep them in your prayers because they need it i want to make one little announcement too and it's not a um i it's kind of funny but yeah i want you to listen because brother dale doesn't text now the bible says faith comes by hearing right right not by testing right and the bible said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel not the days of the texts of the seventh angel right now i just got into the text mode some myself but if something no what i'm trying to say if something's going on in this church you can't text brother dale right and and get any answer you gotta call him or you can text me and i'll call him or physically because what will happen is if you call his cell phone number some of you may have already done it if it goes to voicemail it sends you a link to me where you can call me on my cell phone because i keep mine with me most of the time but what i'm saying is like with sterling being in the hospital and people being in the hospital if you need to get in touch with brother dale don't go on facebook for sure and don't text him because he's not gonna get it right actually don't even leave him a voicemail right he's not gonna get it that's why when i set up his voicemail i set it up to where it says that if you can't reach brother dale and if you need to find him my phone number my cell phone number is on there for you to call me so and i don't mind because i keep mine with me most of the time but he's not tech savvy obviously i was thinking in the shower the other day the bible says faith comes by hearing right not by texting right so i know it's an age to where we like to text each other but if you need brother dale you need to call him right on his physical telephone right so because you never know what happens but we're so used to pulling out a phone and sending a text until it's just nothing you know he's not going to get it right you don't get it so you just send him um even not even a voicemail it's going to come to me so just leave it on on there and i'll get it on my phone so just remember that but but really i mean that's just the way it is you're going to get in touch with brotherdale you need to call them and physically call call them on the telephone all right and also remember uh brother jason jackson's gonna be here this this um the weekend of the uh of the watch night service he's a good brother met him uh up in uh uh virginia and he's good brother good brother and also remember i don't know if any of you know who the laster family is that brother um up in kentucky they used to go to brother butler's church but uh we've known him for a long time but but uh the oldest bruce his um wife is dying with cancer they found it only about a week ago and they've only given her a couple of weeks to live uh her colon burst yesterday and they did operation on it and found that she had cancer all through her body but you know what i don't mean one thing to god that's right i don't mean one thing to god just keep him in your prayers though because it's really a shock about this time and also remember one other request we've got a salesman that works in our livonia office uh his name is hal sauder and his father passed away yesterday so uh just keep him in your prayers also and really just it's a trying time but you know what god built us for this that's right he built this for this time so this is just the way it's going to be he built us to take it he built us to take it if not we wouldn't take it we'd go crazy but he built us to take this time so you just trust in god whatever symptoms come don't worry about the symptoms we look into a god that takes care of all those things he never works off symptoms never he never works off symptoms he never says well if this gets but no he said i'm the lord to heal with all your being so let's just keep all these in in our prayer let's go to the lord and prayer before we before we get started daniel 9 24 we're going to read one scripture there dear lord jesus we pray tonight lord that you would come among us again lord in a special way tonight father we see that there's sickness on every hand we see that the world is falling apart we see that all these things are happening and lord you said they happen for a purpose you said that lord that you whatever that come to your little bride in the end time that you would raise up a standard and you have that standard already there and it's your word fathers we listen to your word tonight we pray that you would just touch each one forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make lord be lord and active participant in this service lord you do the speaking and you do the hearing through our brothers and sisters in the congregation lord and the ones on the internet we pray father that you just be with each one be with brother claude lorded as he's there in the hospital lord just lift him up for your honor and glory lord we pray that you the ones that sister janey lord the one in kentucky lord we

honor and glory for each thing in jesus name amen daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city and we're going to look at tonight we're going see this the people we're gonna take a little bit with the city and at the end of the service we're gonna maybe kind of move over a little bit into the end of the trumpets if we have time if we don't we'll do it at another time but we know that all the trumpets sound under the sixth seal so they all come right there together but seventy weeks are determined upon thy city and upon upon thy people excuse me and upon thy holy city to do six things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now let's go to revelations chapter 6 where we've been in the study on the on the uh sixth seal revelation six verse twelve and i beheld we had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake keep these things in mind the great earthquake the sun became black as sack cloth of hair the moon became its blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree cancer untimely figs now watch all this this is all happening to what nature all right when she is shaking shaking of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains why because of what was happening in nature right right right what was happening in nature right and so it said to the mountains no i'm sorry and the kings of the earth let's finish that one and the great men rich men chief captains mighty men every barman ever freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come not has or will this is come by present tense we know it's a future event to us but is come so let's bring it down to the day he has come because we're going to talk natural and spiritual tithe and who shall be able to stand amen there's a question who shall be able to stand you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word but now look at all these events these events remember that keep that in your mind events brother brown said modern events made clear by prophecy so let's look at these events and see what we're not going to pick each one of them down but we're going to try to go back and and you know brother dale was was preaching the other day and he's always said it but it kind of struck me he said one seal will tell the entire the entire bible together well it's kind of hard sometimes without a spiritual eye to go back and see now i know he's preached it and so have i is where you bring in the four horsemen in genesis with cain and abel all right the blackness of cain and all that but we realize that in this sixth seal this sixth seal is we're gonna read it in just a few minutes but it's a purging time right right the sixth seal was a purging time so god has started since the fall now he didn't need to purge man before the fall man was perfect right the nature was perfect exactly uh the the order of nature was perfect there was no earthquakes before the fall there was no thundering lightning there was no typhoons there was no floods there was no things that that harm the earth and in harming the earth you know we get caught up in that sure they just had a philippines yesterday a typhoon killed 200 and some people just like that because so you're caught up in the nature we can't get away from the natural part of this earth right but when it was in perfect harmony with god the way it should have been adam didn't have to run from nature right eve didn't have to run from nature amen right all right but the animals didn't have to run from each other right then i have to run right peace that's why it comes over until this time and it says peace on earth man good will to man well there's never been peace on earth since the fall that's right but we know that jesus christ brought peace when he came right right man he just hadn't been applied yet we're going to talk about that a little bit but we got to see that that god didn't just that sick seal doesn't just happen with two prophets opening it we know it's gonna happen because it says it in the bible and brother brown said those two prophets open those that sex seal right but we need to see though that if that sick seal is a purging seal or or a sanctifying seal right right yeah we got to see that after the fall even when even when i'm kind of jumping ahead a little bit but when god said i'll put enmity he was getting ready to purge some people right and persian earth he was going to bring everything back to where it should have been to start with right all right so the sixth seal is a seal of nature breaking forth and then you and i are caught in that right because we're part of nature right right all right and let's look at let's pull up number a and let's look and see what purge means because the word purges is all throughout the bible it's it's a it's a wonderful word because it says purge me lord in hebrews it talks about purging and john we'll read it in just a minute first corinthians says purge out therefore the old heaven all right so purging has been spoken back into genesis but look the word purge means to cleanse of filth and purity now watch this it says trees and vines in other words pruning is the same word as purging right because if you don't if you don't prune your vines i have apple trees and i have plum trees and i have certain different plants and even if i could get to my pecan trees i trim them but you're supposed to trim back to bring more fruit jesus said right here in john 15 22 and 15 2 it's not on there but listen every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it right that it may bring forth more fruit sure so the more word purrs the more food fruit will bring forth the more the apple tree you say no you're hurting the apple tree now you're cutting away what the apple tree doesn't need right remember in the corn ears of corn come up and then you got the little suckers well what does the suckers do that's why they're called suckers right right they suck the nutrients out of the tree out of the the stalk but it's useless it'll never come to fruition right it'll never bear fruit it's a sucker it's stunning but it is going to draw that nutrition from that main stalk and cause it to not bring forth much fruit right but that's what jesus said he said purge the vine and it'll bring forth more fruit so how many of us want to be pervs absolutely to bring forth more fruit all right but now look it says also to cleanse look down here at 16 where it says 16 in parentheses all right to make clean to be clean to purify to make cleaner cleanse from physical stains and dirt oh yeah we can purge the outside of this guy but what about the inside right right all right in a moral sense to free from defilement of sin and from fault now that's what god's doing in daniel 9 24 he is going to purge a group of people amen and the earth right right that's right the earth fell when we fell right right the earth found the earth fell because we felt right it wasn't the earth's fault it wasn't the deer's fault right it wasn't the lion's fault that he has to eat another being to survive it's our fault that's right right that's why in romans it says the whole world growing up in travailus waiting on lazy me and you yeah right all right roll it on up is that true right ethically free from corrupt desire from sin and guilt free from every admixture of what is false right in other words we don't want to mix anything with false right sincere genuine blameless innocent unstained with the guilt of anything that's what purging is and that's what purging does so you see what the word purge means it means to cleanse right cleanse me o lord try me o lord purge me o lord but look the effects of the fall we can't get around yeah right we're here but you and i are left with this one thing the last group of people to bring it back that's right right amen without fat without that you forget about 144 000 right because god come to purge me and you first then he goes to israel then he then he goes to the earth and then he does these things for the others you and i are the ones that's holding this whole thing off amen okay you saw not me yeah you're the first one let's look it wrong let's look at romans eight now look how clear it is in romans for the earnest expectation of the creature now what is that and look at your scofield bible it says creation so that's going all the way back to genesis right all right for the earnest expectation of the creature waited they're waiting on us amen for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly the line didn't fall because he wanted to the cheetah didn't fall because he wanted to the tree doesn't die because he wants to right it died because we did it right so not willingly they were subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope amen so we they're under subjection to us subject right right to the same in hope that we're going to bring it back right amen all right because the creature itself also shall be delivered amen exactly success delivered purged from the bodies of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation not one speck of dirt that's not groaning right and travailing right read birth pains the world is in birth pains that's right why because we're here right it's trying to bring forth something from the earth right but we know that you know that's why they call it mother earth right it's what's called mother earth this is mother earth that's what mother nature right okay it's a nurturing of the earth it's the mother part but we know that the whole creation groaneth and travailleth in pain that's why claude's sitting in the hospital that's why sister jamie's that's why we're sick that's why all these things are happening right right in pain together until now so let's come to a place to say until now until now so we can do something about it and he says until now paul's prophesying but we're standing now in that prophecy right all right so god began to cleanse back in the garden of eden when he said i'll put enmity or a division between me and your seed because your seed's corrupt and mine's not right right your seed can't bring anything back mine will amen you can't purge your seed i can purge mine right right because of what happened we're going to have to be purged remember that's permissive well perfect will was we didn't have to be purged right all right let's uh let's go to number one let's look what brother brown said on a sixth seal now before we get started listen to this because remember our body goes first right right our body's purged and redeemed first right then the earth follows amen right right okay so remember this you say well well i i i don't know about this per listen even in your physical body right now you're being purged that's right that's right if not you're like brother claude see his body can't purge that water that's being produced by those damaged cells same thing with cancer cancer is what they do is they they take the chemotherapy and they shoot that chemo in there and try to kill your blood cells to raise those white ones up right the white ones does the fighting right the white ones does the fighting and that's what you're trying to do you're trying to break the body down enough to where the body says hey i gotta start fighting this thing right he tries to bring himself what he's trying to purge that stuff out so so even we know obviously certain things we know is purge but every day you sweat you do the things of life your your body is being purged but now remember adam didn't have to do that before the fall adam's body was perfect he could live in that body and not have to be purged because he had no sin you say how can his body be redeemed simple get it back to the same condition adam was right exactly because he didn't have to be purged every day right now after the fall that's what happened he had to start being purged every day his body did to keep his body have fever right now right when you have fever take fluids drink why they tell you drink fluids liquids and all that stuff what to purge out the bad stuff out of your body right same thing now take that in a spiritual sense get a bad cancer get a bad cold get a bad attitude amen get a bad thought against somebody get a bad desk get about that what's god do he sends you a little fever called a preacher yeah and he gets your blood pressure up a little bit and hopefully that helps you purge a little bit of that out now look brother i want a sixth seal that's the way it works i can see more how god works just in nature right just in nature because that's what he's in that's what he used he used nature that's why nature is going to have to do a reversal that's why those two prophets are going to call those plagues down what to purge this earth but it's going to purge a group of people too right all right same way with you and i we're being purged by the word now all right now i want you to read with me as you do compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption book of redemption all right now remember these are hidden mysteries and the sixth seal all together is one great big book just six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed amen was by that sixth seal but now remember where did it begin does it begin with two prophets well what did god do in genesis let's look at number two and a sixth seal now see if we can get back here under these seals if they can ever get when they're open you can see exactly look what god is doing what he has done and what he's going to do which is which was which is to come right right so it doesn't just show the sixth seal as being boom you and i must understand how that seal works all the way through the bible how the first seal works all the way through the bible the second seal i just picked the sixth seal because i'm in the sixth fold purpose and it fits in good with it because you're gonna have to redeem a group of people out of that six-fold purpose right that last week that but the last three and a half years of jesus's ministry on earth through two prophets is going to thoroughly purge right what did john tell him john told him said his fan is in his hand and he's gonna what he will thoroughly purge the floor amen now what does the threshing do they throw the weed up the tears in the chaff floats off with the wind go somewhere else starts living a different life we're going to look at a little animal in just a few minutes that i had a i had some familiarity with several years ago and was able to learn from it but what comes back down the wheat all the others burnt right all right so that's what he was saying his fan is in his hand that's what he was doing he was fanning the wheat i knew a thoroughly purged his floor well guess what he's talking about me and you right right we know he was talking about purging the people that were there that's what john was talking about he said he'll thoroughly purge the floor well which floor is he going to start with he's going to start with this one when they're open you can see exactly what god is doing what he has done and what he's going to do all right so that which is which was and which is to come all right because you're going to see that this sixth seal brother brown said open in a threefold matter right so we're going to see how that is in just a few minutes now go to number three and finding in this this is in look and finding in this sixth seal that there's a great interruption in nature keep that word nature okay you're gonna think about trees and and and wind and rain and let's talk about this nature yeah right there's what change purges our nature that's right the holy ghost comes in sure and it burns out all the stuff but remember they're still doors yeah remember the the dream that sister shepard had there was water flowing out over right the pyramid and it had one in it trash yeah you still got trash in you even if you're born again that's right but we're going to look and see though i was telling brother donnie he kind of got into my sermon i had to walk out of the room so i told him i said dude you're going to hear it tonight so you don't have to hear it there so the moon the stars the earth belts forth the church is purged israel is purged and everything is purged under that seventh seal we know he was going to the seventh seal so that the millennium can start in there has to be a cleansing first so for god to step on the earth there's got to be a cleansing for god to step into your earth there's got to be a cleansing there's got to be a purging all right and that's what the church today and what i want to point that you need you that we need a cleansing now that word cleansing means what purging all right before anything can begin from god listen before read that before anything right can begin from god we've got to have a purging and when we see when we look and see things that is now under the present condition existing the way they are we can see that we got to have something to happen before god can continue his program and the purging right god's program what's god's program he had a plan and a purpose what to do all god was he poured into christ all christ loves you pour into the church take her back to the garden of eden that's where we went from that's where we got to go back to amen right that's what the purging is going to take us back to all right okay so that's in look but now all right let's go to now genesis 7 because god started to purge the earth way back in the book of genesis with the flood there's a six seal purging of the earth beginning of the purging and the flood and not brother brandon will tell you that in a minute he even says moses the plagues that fell on egypt was a purging right to purge them out of egypt okay now listen listen to this though there was no cleansing factor at that time to cleanse the people from sin right that's right it was only covered right that's right right so it wasn't a purging like we're talking about now but yet it is in type a purging because what happened why did pharaoh let the people go because moses walked up every day and said let my people go right no because of nature because of the falling of nature around egypt he finally said i've had enough right right i've had enough i told him i said we have been a lot of things have happened but there's one thing for sure the elected is going to be ejected one of these days like brother ernie said and what do you do when you purge you eject when you excuse my language when you throw up that's a purging right the reason you get sick and regurgitate is because something in you doesn't need to be there it's a it's a it's a little virus or something and it's got to be purged what you do you get it out right you get rid of the stuff right that's right exactly everything uh everything goes goes along i mean i was sitting the other day and i thought man and i come up on a little animal and i won't tell you about him in a minute okay forget seven days and i will call it rain upon the earth 40 days and 40 nights and every living substance every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth why the the imagination of men's mind the bible says was continually evil god had come to a place to where and listen let me just be honest with you god couldn't cleanse the people brother that okay god couldn't cleanse the people there was no blood sure he said i'll put empty which was a prophecy but he hadn't come yet but he knew he was coming so god's patient god said i'm going to wipe this thing off if you believe me i'll save you i'm going to give you 120 years to listen to this one preacher yeah right that's right and they must have hated him at the end and the beginning because he didn't get no more congregation than what he started with right all right fear not a little flop that was only eight and one of them was the devil right ham that's right but now look watch what he done though because he showed this in tight i have every living substance every tree died all the grass not everything remember when the fountains of deep of the deep right here look it wasn't just a 40-day rain i've been through this with you before but some of the new ones are here it's not just a 40-day rain that destroyed this earth listen in the 600th year of noah's life in the second month 17th day of the month the same day where all the fountains of the great deep broken up now if you'll look somebody sent it to me a long time ago but i can't remember they did a study remember the ground was being moisturized coming up out of the ground right that's what the bible said right there was no rain there was no clouds there was moisture coming up out of the ground and that gave you your your moistness of the soil so what was underneath there was viaducts of water right running underneath when god created the earth he made those viaducts under the water big ones i ain't talking about these little buildings i'm talking big big ones and what happened was all the fountains in the deep what happened was they broke they broke up and when they did they flipped yeah that's right a total interruption of nature right but that god couldn't save those people as he's purging them now because the blood sacrifice was not there we know before the foundation of the world but listen why didn't god just save the whole world yeah if that was true no he's still his program still is you believe what i say i'll save you right amen it was then and it is now right only eight people and it's i was thinking about this this morning the bible says as it was in the days of noah there's seven billion people on the earth right now yeah there were seven billion people on the earth in noah's age eight people one two three four five six seven eight sorry for you well i'm one of the animals but from here back died only eight people when they walked out of that ark there was only eight people on the earth because god said every living substance that i have made i will destroy right okay and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man cattle creeping things foul of the heaven they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark and the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days anybody know how many how long ago was in the ark 140 days but one year one month i've got my bible he was in that ark over a year right feeding those animals how must have been god but see god had a program that he was going to destroy the world but those that believed him went over on the ark right right all right so now god has started a purging of the earth because nature was lost right brother brown said everything fell in the garden of eden right right you and i first and then everything tumbled behind it all right so now let's go to all right we got all those let's go to exodus 10 because brother brown said right here's where god purged israel and the lord said unto moses stretch out thy hand toward heaven that there may be darkness because brother brown he goes in that sixth seal and he said see he said there's been darkness in the land a lot more than just the time of the sixth chapter the sixth chapter of revelations these two prophets are not gonna bring something on the scene that hadn't already happened earthquakes and you know not rain for three and a half years they're used to it because god did it during the time that they were here moses and elijah stretch out thy hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days and they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings goshen remember they had life right so god was taking care of his people that he was getting ready to purge out of israel i'm out of egypt because that's getting over toward the end of the purging time all right now let's go to number four quote number four this is brother brown he talks about this on the sixth seal all right now let's turn to exodus 10 21 through 23 exodus 10 21. now i just read that to you and scroll up notice just exactly like come over here and the sun became as black as sackcloth see same thing these happenings of nature look at that word nature what is it what when nature happens like this has been god calling israel right all right he called him out of bondage with these this interruption of nature amen all right so god calling out israel now here he is bringing them out of the roman hands now he's over 144 000 now yeah right because he brought him out of egypt then now he's bringing them out of the hands of the romans now here he is bringing them out of the roman hands where they've made their covenant same thing happens that's the plague the time that this plague will call they'll plague this group of gentiles right so the gentiles why why are the gentiles going to be plagued they turned down their prophet right anywhere in the bible you see anybody turn down a prophet that's judgment right united states turn brother brown them down turn the prophet of the end time down so judgment that's what he says they'll play this group of gentiles right see the time that this plane will call they'll plague this group of gentiles because what plagues israel the rejecting of the two prophets right that's what causes their purging so so i i don't understand these people that are that are rejecting brother brown because i don't see nothing but plagues right you're right i don't see nothing but plagues to fall on them right right right you turn brother branham down as being the prophet of the end time and being the the mouthpiece of god you bring the plagues of the book down around right so that's what i told him i told brother gerald hughes the other day um we um online brother bob black sent that uh email about the man named sirenthius who preached or was that he was a gnostic during the time of polycarp and he was preaching that jesus wouldn't go out to the river jordan i mean he preached the same thing that they're preaching now two thousand years ago and then john the revelator found out he was in the same house with this ceremonies guy runs out of the bath house and says i don't even want to get be caught in the same house with this guy because he's a deceiver of the people right right right that's the plane right that's the plague that'll fall all right now let's go to number five and the sixth seal back again now look see here god is about to deliver his son israel after the same manner of the tribulation that he did down there moses see he sent moses down there and delivered israel is that right and he done these very same things what did he do turned the river to blood he brought locust he he brought darkness that's right all the things he sent elijah they have right purging a group of people what he purged 7 000 people came out amen 7 000 people quit doing what they were doing and followed god's word right all right you see a pattern here you see a pattern god's always been able to purge a group of people out of purging nature amen that's why that struck my heart the other day god delivered his people using nature nature's what we fell and then nature fell so god's using nature to bring us back right right to bring us back and that sick seal is exactly what it's doing that's it look he sent elijah to ahab and 7 000 came out is that right he sends him right back over here again in the time of the tribulation and calls out the 144 thousand what he purged the group of 144 000 you you read it sunday about what he he took and and brought out a group of people right all right now see you notice between revelation or between the sixth chapter or the sixth plague seal pardon me between the sixth c and the seventh seal the seventh chapter of revelation mathematically set together right yeah you see what he's talking about right revelation six the seventh seal doesn't open to revelations eight one right revelation seven is what bringing in what brother dale was told until today bringing in the tribes and boy i really enjoyed that that really answered a big question of mine he and i were talking about the other day but it really helped me to understand why those certain tribe went in certain tribe went out right certain tribe went ahead and traveled with there well god didn't give the promise to joseph's two kids he gave the promise to jacob's 12 children right and those 12 children which included levi and dan see remember ephraim and manassas i wondered how they got swapped there i mean got split because dan and ephraim was taken out right but you see dan back in at one time over there and dan and ephraim's back in but where's manasseh but you see that when we go to that city and look at that gate you're going to have 12 gates and they're going to be jacob's kids amen not joseph kids jacob's kids and that makes your 12 which is levi and joseph perfect just the words perfect you know that okay right all right number six on the sixth seal if that is so now we for we know that this sixth seal is the judgment seal so god when god said this that's what struck me when god said i'll put enmity what is enmity division i'll put a division between me and you because we're all born that serpent seed so there was a division but i'm going to come and and breach that gap right i'm going to breach that gap back because god and adam could stand side by side adam didn't have to be purged right right he could just walk right up the guard i'm talking about man right now why didn't he do that brother robbie why didn't he do that after he said i'm afraid after what happened in the fall god said where are you adam he said i'm over here but i was afraid right what was he afraid of something had come between him and god amen so god said okay i'll use that gap called sin to keep you from coming to me but i'll make a way i'll make a way because he purged himself at calvary right right that's the woman's seed genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman and then i'll put this thing back together in the other word in other words but look the sixth seal is the judgment seal it's a judgment seal exactly what it is right now here is the breaking forth of the judgment upon the people where out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144 000 redeemed jews right all right i'll prove that they're jews somebody probably you know a lot of people thought the hundred forty four thousand was the bride or gentiles and no it has nothing to do with that 144 000 is 12 000 from 12 tribes right that's 144 thousand all right for some of you maybe that that that's new that's okay now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word my brother don't read this one too it's the judgment seal of the word so it's not just in revelation six verse 16 or whatever it is that's not when the sixth seal starts sure that's when it breaks forth in its fullness as the book of revelation but god is starting to purge people since he said i'll put enmity there i'll put division in other words i'm going to purge this earth remember what he said brother brown said god's program god's program is to bring us back right it's his job it's his job to do it he said he was going to do that right because he's got some lost kids out there that that needs to be found right he's got an earth that he don't like this earth to be in the condition that's why he can't come down here in a physical form that's why the millennium is for him to come down here with us but it's after the purging of the earth is the last thing right to be purged okay the earth so he can do what step his foot on it so there's still even a division there and i was telling brother donnie it you say well what about people let me make this statement and don't get me wrong the people that have dead i have died and went on they've went through their purging because we plant them in corruption and we raise them in what right oh really so there's their purging right they have to go back into the earth and as god purges the earth he purges them this purging i'm talking about is live people though right remember that this is live people that's right god's purging live people right not dead people if you die and go on brother tom has been purged done what else is there left god purged him he gave him the baptism of the holy ghost and purged his soul but the curse of the fall took him down to the ground incorrupt in corruption not incorruptible in the corruption he's in the earth right but when he comes back up he's going to be purged amen that's right so what does death do to a christian purges it purges the old man right i was telling somebody the other day we're going to be changed the bible says i'm changing the moment twinkling woman eye remember the original says changed in the atoms right where are we falling our atoms is what's killing us because in a fallen condition but when we're changed in the atoms we're purged we're done there's our body there's the cleansing so just remember that there's got to be this group that we're talking about now is a live group of people right because even the foolish version we'll talk about in just a minute has got to be purged they're going to have to be killed but they're going to go through a tribulation to purge them right then they're going to die the 144 000 is going to go through a purging then they're going to die but now remember because of the opening of the seals there's a group of people praise the lord that's right it's going to go through a purging and not die amen that's right because they're going to be changed in the moment in the 20th of an eye right here amen but we got to take these seals and we got to take all the plan of redemption and apply it i said apply it right you know jesus died at calvary it proves everything amen right everything right even the jews sure right but they rejected it we accepted it right right all right we'll just hold that for just thought for just a second we'll get to it all right where are we at now notice the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word so every time we read the word that sixth seal is opening up to you amen that seal is being made known to you that you need this because of this amen that's why that's why pharaoh said go he knew if he kept that group of people there he wasn't going to have anything left and that's what the devil same thing with the devil one day he's going to have to let us go amen he's the only one that's got us bound right between our ears there's the enmity that's the division is about the eight inches or bless his heart brother claus is about 12 inches between his ears he got just a big head but he's going to have to purge that group of people so much the word we're going to have to remember brother brown said i want to be so close and wrapped up in god right yes that satan doesn't know what to do with me right right now that's a purging that's the purging time that's when we come to a spot where when the devil don't know what to do because he knows what to do with you he'll kill you right you don't know what to do he'll just kill you right he can't touch the soul but he knows he can kill that guy right because he's got a claim on it right but we gotta see here that how this sixth seal purges that claim of israel because god told them i mean they told themselves they said let his blood be on us and our children that's right right exactly in other words they they basically cut their self off from redemption right but god said father forgive them for they know not what they did right so the purging started with israel think of ad70 titus is like it's like claude said actually titus's father is the one that encircled israel yeah and and they were there for so long they sent him back to to uh wherever he was in rome and made him an emperor and his son titus which was a mean guy he's the one that finished the job he's the one that went in and took over because the people of israel were so stubborn they thought god was still with them when he had already left because they had what they called judgment on themselves right because jesus said don't be in the city don't be in the city when this happens don't be here when it's happening don't do this when it's out he was preaching to him he was telling them don't do it right yeah dudes and don't sorry amen they're there somewhere yeah there's a lot of grace but there is some do's and don'ts in there right all right but what's the sixth seal doing that is purging the old man notice the sixth hill is the judgment seal of the word all right let's go to isaiah 13. i think that's the next one in it brother yes now isaiah 13 watch this is where god is delivering israel how ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be feign and every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pains and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travails birth pains hello that's what we were talking about they shall be amazed one another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate right over in daniel he says until desolations are determined this is what's going to happen all right so now i want you to look they scrolled it and i lost it number ten nine thank you behold behold the damn lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it purging amen purging right god's getting rid of the drops he's getting rid of the old you i hope you're seeing the spiritual part of this all right for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their life you heard that before that was when the sixth seal opens amen in the book of revelations the sun shall be darkened as is going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and i will punish the world for their evil what purge and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud deceased and will lay low the hardness of the terrible did you read down there where it said the kings of the earth and the great man and the rich men said let the rocks fall on that one that's the arrogant people that's the one that said hey that's no problem we're okay but when they see those plays coming down and they hear even not even see those two prophets if they hear that there's two men that's just absolutely when they just move their hand an earthquake happens just drops a whole city down in it right you think they're going to be arrogant and proud then i don't think so but i will cause the arrogancy of the proud deceased i will lay low the hardness of the terrible i will make a man more precious than find gold now what's he doing he's going to bring somebody out of this god's not just going to waste his place he's always brought something or somebody out of something all right i will make a man more precious than find gold even a man than the golden wedge of offer therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place what the earth is going to do what turn right back up on its axis again right and who can do that god all right therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger so see there's a sick seal there in isaiah brother brown said i don't know if it's this quote or one coming up let's go to number seven excuse me yeah see even in the sixth seal and look 13th chapter of isaiah let's begin here at the sixth verse now we're going to read this again how ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction with the almighty watch this sixth seal opening up here now plumb back here 713 years before christ even come on the earth he's been 2 000 years that'd be about seven about 2700 years ago isaiah seen this seal hanging there now we know it breaks in its natural form over here again in israel but it's being spoken of all down through the ages and all down to the scriptures therefore shall all hands be faint every man's heart shall melt what did jesus say and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax them and man's hearts will be failing for fear see a roaring man's hearts will faint now he reads all that go down to the bottom see there just exactly isaiah saw the same thing that jesus spoke of that the seventh seal reveals when he's cleansing the land with tribulations that's the tribulation period this sixth seal yes he was a prophet and the word of god was made known to him that's 2700 years ago amen brother brown was trying to tell the people that the sixth seal it's going to open in its pure form over there but it's being shown all the way through them right since the book of genesis first seal has been shown all the way through since the book of genesis second seal all the way through the book of genesis all right and i don't know where brother raised that in that but you know dad preached after he preached the seals he preached the seals in the ages the seals and genesis and he preached the seals coming down through there in other forms other than just one two three four five six seven right but you see here that let's go to isaiah 24. here's one i picked up that i just kind of uh i'm not smart enough to remember all this stuff so i'll write a header up in the top of my bible i'll uh i'll write it up there is that the next one we go to y'all asleep back there hello all right they're taking a break okay let's take a break isaiah 24 19. he must have missed that one yep okay look isaiah 24 19 the earth is utterly broke down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression therefore shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall punish the hosts of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited all right then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion mount zion and in jerusalem right brings in 144 000 too in the city too and before his ancients gloriously god is going to has been speaking of this sixth seal all down through scripture showing and pointing what's going to happen now they don't have isaiah 53 but if you'll turn there and read yourself you don't have to do that tonight read isaiah 53 the whole six full purpose is opened up in isaiah 53. exactly transgression sin iniquity all these things you can see who has believed our report just keep going up keep going all the way we know he was as fine as let's go on up to about number six verse six and all we like sheep have gone astray we've turned everyone to his own way the lord has laid on us the iniquity laid on him the iniquity remember make an end of sin transgression remember the sixth full purpose iniquity those words and the sexual purpose what's he doing all we got she's going straight we've turned everyone around the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us he didn't have any but he had ours right he was oppressed he was afflicted yet open on his mouth he brought us a lamb to the slaughter and there's a sheep before shears down so he opened on his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment keep scrolling up please okay for he was cut off remember we preached on who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of living for the transgression of my people was he stricken what's god doing he's purging a son he's purging a son to be able to deliver a group of people right and he made his grave with the wicked and with a rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he put him to grief when he shall make his soul and offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied for by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify amen many for he shall bear their iniquities glory see look therefore i would divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with a strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressor but he wasn't a transgressor he was numbered with the transgressor and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressor does that seem familiar over there in daniel 9. amen all of that he's doing is he's taking his people and he's purging his group of people that didn't want him to transgressed they sinned they they they uh caused iniquity and all those things but god said hey i'm not worried about that i'm gonna give you my soul a ransom so that i'll see my seed in other words my blood is gonna be poured out for you now let's go to matthew 24 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light the scars shall fall from heaven is this all familiar we've been talking about it all evening all right and the stars shall fall from heaven now watch what's this brother goes back to matthew 24 and shows that brother brown preached six seals all right and here's the number six right here that i think brother dale read it last sunday and the starship all from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour now this was after the crucifixion this is matthew 27 45. this is when god was purging his son right all right god was purging his son at calvary we know he fought it out in the garden but he had to go to calvary that's where he really had to be in control right he was he was in control of everything amen he said into my hands i command my spirit he wasn't killed he gave his life right okay all right matthew 27 51 and behold the veil of the temple was renting twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake in the rocks rent so brother brown said there was the judgment seal there was a sixth seal there's calvary and you know we've heard it preached many times before that a six seal calvary is a purging that purged his body that purged him yeah right right all right so now let's go to number eight six seal go back again he was now hanging on the cross at three o'clock on good friday afternoon just about to take place matthew 27th chapter of matthew in the 45th verse i just read that all right blackness darkness egypt blackness darkness god delivering jesus at the cross just before he brought him up from the resurrection first darkness sun went down in the middle of the day and stars wouldn't shine two days from then he was going to raise him up with a mighty trump after the sun moon and stars and everything in egypt all these taking place he delivered israel to the promised land now what he's going to do now he's going to deliver israel 144 000 he's going to deliver them into the millennium all right he's going to deliver them he's going to purge them so much until they're going to be in the millennium with a group of people that was already purged us yeah right we're not given white robes there we're giving white robes tonight if you're born again you've got a white robe all right and you're protected glory in your soul you're protected satan can't get to you but he still can get to this thing right here because it's corruptible right right is no corruption in god glory there's no corruption in his word right that's why these people try to say that the word is fallible or or that's what they're trying to say even when they say jesus made mistakes and made slips of the tongue and brother brandon made slips as dumb they're saying they're fallible that the word's fallible yeah the word is infallible right period right i ain't arguing with nobody about that unlike the bath house incident you start talking about fallibility of the message i'm leaving right now amen amen that's a good judgment for me to be purged from right because i don't want to be you know what john was saying i don't want to be in the same house if god decides to strike that man i don't want to be in the same house with him that's what he was saying right they were in a bathhouse together and he went running out and said i'll not be in the same house with that man no we gotta love everybody yeah that wasn't a lot of love involved there all right so now now listen listen to me for a minute god redeemed everything at calvary right right amen but now listen he applied it as it was accepted one more time he applied it as it was accepted right if not the rapture would have took place when the dead saints raised out of the ground right right but he applied it as it was accepted the pardon purged that man if he would have accepted that pardon it would have purged him from killing the man right because the pardon sign said release the man purge him from anything he had done before but he when he didn't accept that he had to stand exactly on what he was right a murderer and they shot him the next day right same way with you and i pardon's not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon you accept the pardon then that purges you from what you've done right right and covers you but see the jews rejected that they rejected that pardon at calvary but so that god could blind the eyes of his own children like we were being going into now but i want to show you a little something because the gentiles accepted it and how are we purged because it's going to be where maybe we'll have time to get into it but we have been in the feast of pentecost all down through the church ages right we've been in the feast of pentecost all the way down he's dealing with the gentiles amen sure we know the jews came in right there at first 120 and 3 000 but he turned to the gentiles and began to give them the holy ghost because what's the feast of pentecost at the feast of pentecost is when they received the holy ghost right when the day of pentecost was fully come right they were in the upper room you understand we're in the scripture here but the gentiles accepted it but how are we purged it's the purging of our old nature yeah very elementary but we got to see that the same persian that god purged the earth with and it's not that oh when 14 earthquakes begin to happen we need to get ready no or when we got this happen or or that happened sure we know things happen for a purpose to drive us to the homeland we know that but we don't need to wait until california sinks and then try to get ready right that's why we come to church on sunday it's why we come to church on wednesday we're being purged amen just like i said many times before and i know some of you can't make church on wednesday and i know some of you can't make every sunday but you miss a visitation from all the almighty man if you miss church if i'm sick this is where i want to be this is where god promised he'd visit me i don't know that he promised he visited me at my house i know he said i'll be right here at ten and two on sunday and it's seven on wednesday night right so if you want to go where god is you need to be right here right you sure well god's with me all the time that's true but he promised he'd be right here right where two or three are gathered together in my name there i'll be in the midst all right so anyway i picked up on something and i forgot about this when i owned the seafood company we had a little thing that we would get from louisiana called the crawfish or some of you want to call it a crayfish it's c-r-a-w it's craw it's not cra that's crayfish it's crawfish or claude call it crawdaddy yeah but the story of the crawfish goes like this we used to buy them in 30 pound richard do you remember about getting those things you know it was before richard's time back when we first started jng poultry and seafood we we merged the seafood company in with us but we didn't know deadly about seafood we knew that it smelled like fish look like fish so it must be fish that's all we knew so stan started getting we get this truck backed up one day and josiah there's this big old thing like this and it's it's mesh and they threw it up on the dock and the thing started moving this little red bag and started moving and you could hear something clicking and i looked down and it was about 5 000 crawfish about that big from louisiana now crawfish is a special animal crawfish lives in brackish water or salt water in the bayous of louisiana and they're bottom suckers so were you right and they suck up mud and that's they get their nourishment out of the little plankton and stuff that's in that mud so they suck that mud up into their stomach well what you have to do is you have to purge him before you eat him so what do you do you change from where he was to where he's going to be yeah you take him out of that salt water and that real warm salt water and you put him in a tub of good fresh cold water and the first thing he does he burps all that mud up yep it's called purging you have to purge that crawfish before you can eat him yeah but you have to take him from what his old nature was in the things of the world and the water that was salt that he was real warm and had a real good time out there drinking smoking gambling running around doing all the things that a crawfish does and you take and change his position amen yeah and what does it do it purges it you give him some water of the word right you give him some good fresh clean water he's not used to that he's used to eating mud he's used to eating all that old junk inside there but if you put him in good clean water first thing he does he starts throwing up all that junk of the world that's right he starts throwing all that stuff up and that's what you call it you call it purging crawfish you take that whole bag and you put it down in water in a in a tub and it's good old clean water but you know what about 15 minutes later it's dark and muddy and grungy so you have to take it out shake it off put them in another batch of water until the water is pretty clean then you can eat the crawfish that's the same thing what god did with you and i right man yeah we were an old crawfish that had a good time where we were at and we loved the water that we were in and we loved all that mud and junk that we loved before right but when god took us and put us in another place he changed our nature amen it purged our old nature to make us to where god could use us amen but i thought about the story of the crawfish just something to help you to see that what god has done to a group of gentiles and that's what he's done amen he took us out of the world and he put us in some good fresh clean environments and good fresh clean water what clean people man i hate getting the grunge of the world on me don't you i hate it sure i love to to do things with people and and all but man there's a time when i want to go with that stuff off right i want that stuff purge you know what every once in a while i might just get another gulf of mud because i'm still a crawfish right but god does what he just takes a little more good cold fresh water of the word throws me in it yeah holds my head under he says throw it up boy right throw it up i know it's in there throw it up all right and that's exactly what god done and that's what he's doing even to the to the jews because he's going to take 144 000 let's go back to daniel 9 24 and bring all that down to here to where we can see that 70 weeks are determined upon thy people now he's going to purge a people in a city because of their what because of their transgression right because of their sin and because of their iniquity they got their self into this place and then the city got desecrated right because the mosque of omar's sitting over there now they're gonna have to wipe that thing off they're gonna have to purge that mosque off of there for them to build that city in the millennium you're not gonna see a little moscow omar sitting up in the millennium no that thing's going to be blown to pieces right they're going to wipe what they're going to purge that thing off so that they can build a real temple there because that's where the temple is going to be right there all right to finish the transgression make an end of sins make reconciliation for iniquity bring in everlasting righteousness now after the purging is over that's what it's going to bring in that's what brother tim calhoun called me a couple days ago and he said i see it i said i said what do you say he said i see that that 70 weeks of daniel has to lap over into the millennium glory because right here here's where the reconciliation of iniquity this is where israel is restored the people right yeah that's right then there's a battle of armageddon right right cleansing of the earth purging of the earth and then bringing everlasting righteousness well the way that most people have got it in a message and look i'm looking right straight at you i don't care who you are the bible says these six things are gonna happen in that 70 weeks of daniel right every how you put it ever what you think the prophet said he didn't say what you thought he said all right that's right because right here israel is finished their pursing is finished right here right battle of armageddon cleans and purges the earth right right then how are you going to bring an everlasting righteousness are they going to build a city and then destroyed in the battle of armageddon because the way the people preaching the message there's only three and a half years left of 70 weeks of daniel after the rapture how can you do that you can't the bible didn't say that right there's no half weeks in the bible right right right there's four weeks seventy weeks are determined upon god people in the holy city holy city to do these six things and brother brown said this anointing to the most holy is us riding back in the millennium right we can't ride back in the millennium before the battle of armageddon right do you see how that they're misplacing the word brother brown said don't well it didn't help me you preached on many times miss place dislocate misplace this mission thank you i knew you all know and i had it written down somewhere the other day but those three things and if they don't do it right then that's what brother brown said you're going to put the cow eating grass way up here it's a pretty picture it's a cow it's a tree it's green grass but the cow's not in the tree and that's the same way with the word of god if you don't place it right now the way the way that that we see it now is that we see a full picture of redemption taking us all the way in right all the way into the millennium completely purged the gentiles the 144 000 right even the fifth sealed jew and the earth right so we don't dislocate or misinterpret or any of those things when you see that there is one week left after the rapture for the redemption of israel and the city right nobody understand that amen now there's only three and a half years of ministry left to do that right 1260 days in 260 days israel is going to be redeemed right see that's not redeeming the earth right at that time it's beginning to be just in stages like we just talked about starting from the flood coming all the way down to jesus now coming down to the full plan of redemption finishing on the earth all right right everything's going to sit back up straight the earth's going to be purged off and then we're going to be able to right see right here everything's got to be purged here or he can't come down here right so revelations 19 21 is when he rides back with us to rule and reign on the earth right so that the purging and all has got to be finished because we know the sixth seal opens while the two prophets opened it during that 1260 days everybody understand that during that 160 days the two prophets opened that sixth seal they caused this interruption of nature that we're talking about interrupting our nature but it interrupts the nature of the whole earth the jews 144 000 and bringing everlasting righteousness brother brown said that's when satan is sealed in the bottomless pit well buddy let me tell you something that's pretty purged yeah now we know the full purging comes at the white throne judgment we know that when satan is destroyed before he even gets there but see this is the time for the jews to enjoy amen us to enjoy our honeymoon right right us to enjoy the honeymoon come in here to the millennium but all this has got to be purged before god can step on the earth before god can step in this earth we've got to be purged we can't be the old crawfish that's full of mud like we were before we got to be a new crawfish right looks like a crawfish smells like a crawfish acts like a crawfish is how we were in the world yeah but now we still look like a human we act like a human but we're not human in the terms that we were before right now we've been purged we've been changed changed amen our change started when we got born again right right then it works its way out all right let's finish right here revelation 7 3-6 saying hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads and i heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed in 144 i'm sorry 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel other charges of judah and it keeps going down through there and it it names them all off they are sealed or purged all right sealed until the day of the redemption all right so look as it took a prophet to purge us when when brother brown brought the word he brought it not disfigured he didn't bring it misinterpreted like they say or dislocated he put it just exactly the way it was supposed why'd he say he had to tile them loose ends up why there was loose ends dangling there was things that people didn't understand they see the book of redemption in god's program like we read a minute ago god's program runs like this it's not broken up and changing his mind and changing this and changing that god don't change his mind this is his program there's no gaps in that program but what happened is man has pulled gaps out of the program and said i think it's this i think there's only three and a half years after the rapture and that's all because that's what brother brown said that's your opinion right he didn't say i was wrong he said you didn't understand what i said ah man i don't see how they don't get that he didn't he never said i was wrong he said you didn't understand what i said right he wasn't changing what he said they just didn't understand what he was saying all right but thank god for the opening of the seals because the opening of the seals will bring you back glory and show you the whole plan of redemption the way it's supposed to have been and you say well it's not important because we're not going to be here that sixth seal has to open to you just like it opens to those two prophets over there or you don't take a body change you don't take a body change unless that six seal opens the same way right right because we're dealing with our nature right right with earthquakes and with he said a total interruption of nature right your nature right now just like the two prophets you're going to interrupt nature on the earth god is interrupting your nature through what one prophet brought a message to the gentiles and that is doing what it's supposed to do it is purging your own nature out this was never taught things were never taught like brother brown taught him right sure man probed at him but brother brown come and god put that program together there's no gaps you know if rapture and faith lies in the books and tapes if there's one error and we know there's where brother brown talked about the holy ghost being a white horse rider and that was something that god corrected him on him man he said if the holy spirit had to come in the room and corrected me on what i was going to say right right so listen to what i'm saying but if you can find a flaw in the message then rapture and faith don't land in books today right right because what i've got to put my soul dependency that this message is the message right not the message of william branham but the message of almighty god through a man that said 700 meant 7 000. but listen the holy spirit is the deserter the holy ghost is what you're supposed to say here and if daddy says abraham and he means adam right now lord you're supposed to know the difference i honestly i try to correct him because the people on the tape yeah because they'll take what you say and they'll say just like brother brown 707 000 they wrote him about 10 questions brother brown you mean 700 what they were doing is they were saying did you change the bible it means 700. no i just said 700 meant 7 you know just a human error human mistake but if rapture and faith doesn't last we can't put our sole dependency on what we read right we can't put our soul dependency on what we try to live i say try to live if we can't put our soul dependency that this message is infallible that's right then we can't take a body chain right right there is no way you're going to have to go to the grave and be purged that's right right you're going to have to be purged in the grave if you can't say that this message is rapturing faith doesn't lie on the tapes it lies in them so you gotta get in there and dig them out right all right amen look at number nine almost done seventh seal now we find out also this that the sixth seal now being open it was for a threefold purpose now here was the purposes the first thing was that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification we just went through that remember they go through and they die all right she had to be purged of her sins there's that word purge of her sins of unbelief why she was that crawfish but she held a little bit of that mud in her she didn't get totally purged remember she's she's a virgin but she didn't get the holy ghost she didn't get god dwelling inside all right she had to be purged for her sin of unbelief and rejecting the message right this what she this she was done in the tribulation period we see that wind up over here in revelation 7 between 6th and 7th chapter here that she had been pursed and she's been given her roles right all right now now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive a message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets right you notice that another purging time so the six sales all got to do with purging another purging time that's for israel when she gathers now he's talking about 144 000 right that's the second fold god purges israel in the tribulation period out of the millions that will gather there there'll be a selected 144 000 and they will be purged also god purging israel notice there is a whole earth to be purged that's number three all right there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself right being purged getting ready for the millennium the millennium's coming and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal so god's shown all down through time that i am going to purge a group of people under this sixth seal now now do you notice in the opening of this seventh seal it's also in the threefold matter we'll get to that maybe later i know brother dale will so let's go to number 10. i i said a minute ago i that people must be alive to be purged because death purges the body for the ones that are going that went on by the grave but now how are they going to be brought up let's look at that just for a second don't look at the quote how's that going to happen yeah there's got to be a group of people that's purged more than the ones that died yeah that just makes sense it does that just makes sense it's got to be a group of people standing here that's so more purged than the ones that are in the grave that the ones are in the grave have to come and meet those that are purged right right so there's a soul purged group so you know what that you know what that shows me that it can happen right that's right and it will happen amen so there is a group of people that's going to be standing here that's going to be so purged that when death crawls up your sleeve right right right the mud goes out right the drops the junk right the flues get stopped up remember he talked about flush same thing with a with it with a crawfish but buddy once he's purged he's good to eat yeah but you've got to purge him first right before he's good and that's the same way what god's doing he's going to show purge a group said he would and under the seals he has to because it's the seals of redemption right so he has to do it because he promised he would so there's going to be a group so purged here that the group that's purged in the ground is going to have to meet that and they're going to have to come back to that that's why they're going to come back to us that's my brother ramsey you're going to look around you're gonna see what you're gonna see the people that come out of the grave you're gonna see them why because they're connected to you right you've been so purged by the word of god now look let's just get 10 11 12 and 13 here real quick because we've got to get into the gentiles in the feast of pentecost and then we're going to look just for a second at the feast of trumpets and then we'll do the feast of the trumpets maybe sometime later what can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is they're the one who brings on this sick seal right they uncover and open it now listen what do they say what position are they in to be able to say that right because a group of gentiles has come to that position amen first that's right right because we're first partakers the feast of pentecost you got you took right right the feast of pentecost is when god comes to the people all right beats the pentecost the the whole time from pentecost to the gentile doors shut that's the feast of pentecost when god comes and gives us the baptism of the holy ghost right all right so watch they uncover and open it up it's the power of god to interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature right so it's got to be that they know something about that nature or nature i'm talking about the ground nature and all these things looking back and seeing that we took a rapture by the interruption of our nature that's the way i see it they're connected with us those two prophets brother brown said the spirit will come off the gentile church and do what go right over to the jews and start with them what the same message right the same message that look glory jesus christ purged your sin whether you said what you said or not let his blood be on us and our children he promised you you know what they're gonna do they don't even have to read them the new testament yeah because the old testament what's going to come alive right to those people over there because they know the word but when their eyes are open they're going to see isaiah 53 they're going to see a virgin shall conceive they're going to see and all that revelation i'd only believe they got to read the new testament why because that was to us corinthians and visions now that was to us right to take us up a statue of a perfect man or do those things but the old testament's gonna be made alive their their eyes have been covered from the old testament the revelation of the old testament do you know they have a lot of traditions over there right right tradition says tradition says what it's passed down one from the other tradition says this is what they've done tradition says this is what they saying psalms 19 or psalms 119 the tradition says they don't have a clue there's about 18 000 different traditions but remember brother brown said that orthodox group that one that really knows the word god's going to come to him and say hey i came to you right here and you turn me down then they're gonna say oh god we're done because see they don't see redemption in there they don't see redemption and getting rejected right but god will say look i'm the one in isaiah 53. he said i'll take your transgression right i'll take your sin read daniel 9 24 he'll tell him he says look read daniel 9 24. look what happened i made an end to your sin i made an end to your transgression i made an end to your iniquity that's right you're free right you're purged and they say oh god we missed it but he said no don't worry these nail scars i got in the house are my friends do you get it now there's your seal who does it it's the prophets the other side of the rapture amen with the power of god the word of god they just condemn nature they can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood sun can go down or anything at their command amen there you are there you are see now how the seals open down there in the church ages look see how the seals open down there in the church age how it showed the martyrs and now here's these two prophets standing here with the word of god to do anything to nature they want to and they shake the earth see look the reason they're doing that all the gentiles are gone right that's right their body's not laying in the grave right he ain't got to be purged again right this earth has got to be purged all right remember they've had a resurrection their bodies have come up they've come out of the purging and they've taken their they've been taken up so these two prophets they said hey them guys over there can do it so can we all right because look and it shows exactly who does it it's moses and elijah because their ministry is re-impersonated again both men oh my do you see it now see what the sick seal is it's those prophets now notice don't let it choke you but watch what opened that seal prophets see amen there you are oh we're living in the eagle day brother head up among the clouds they open that sixth seal they have power to do it there's your sixth seal coming open all right let's go to the next one real quick number 11. now here is this is the feast of the trumpets now here's the calling out time now listen don't get involved in the all trumpet sound on the sixth seal and we'll break that down and brother dale's done it before and brother dean's preached on it before and several others just just be careful and let somebody explain it to you about all how the trumpets sound and how this happens and how that happens because it is a little confusing if you don't have it put together right all right same way we're down seven to eight same way with anything amen if you don't have it put together it's confusing and i don't like confusion now here's the calling out time at the sixth seal when it opened the persecution struck the jews in the literal standpoint listen now and here comes the persecution to the church and the ecclesiastical standpoint so the sixth seal is not just going to be to the 144 thousand it's a three-fold matter right it's where in the ecclesiastical standpoint who is that for the because the ecclesiastical people are going to kill the foolish virgin right right because the bride is already called so we're gone the sabbaths are over and ready for the jews to be called where to the feast of atonement oh church don't you see that call to the feast of the atonement to recognize the atonement not to kill something again you don't put christ back on the cross but you realize out of isaiah 53 that he's already been killed exactly he was bruised for your iniquity israel what re what to recognize the atonement not know more chickens and geese and what they've been doing the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world israel is going to know that amen what it's going to be revealed all right let's try the next one six seal here it is in the tribulation period and here stands in prophets to who has the control of the word that god gives them they can only speak as god gives them the word see don't go down the bottom he's fixing to take the 144 000 out for redemption out of the book of redemption the sixth seal book of redemption all right and that's under the seal of redemption in the sixth seal because six seals finishes redemption sealed that redeem it brings crops back right that's why you can see now that it's the end of seven seals the end of all things right it brings him back to the earth with us in the millennium all right that's it my dear friends that's that sick seal being so mysterious the sixth cell is very important right very important you know the other all the other ones are but the sixth seal right now to a group of people the sixth seal is very important right because it's that last purging of the old nature getting ready for him to come back right right okay so we're right at the door of that i know that the first one is important if the first one didn't break you couldn't get the rest of them which is one god but i believe there's a group of people that's worked their way up to that amen sick seal up to that time to where we have to realize we have to be purged we have to realize that we have to walk the walk and talk the talk right all right let's go to number 13. lord i'm sorry it's 9 o'clock but let's get this right here because just kind of keep this in your mind because we're going to do the feast of the trumpets maybe later on after the first of the year and by the way i'm not going to uh i'm not going to the philippines i don't feel led to go now as much as i thought maybe i kind of have a zeal in my own self but i'm not going i'm going to kind of stay around the house stay around here the gathering of israel is the trumpets the trumpets is together in israel now what does the trumpet do blow of a trumpet it brings the group together right all right notice the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail and everything scattered the ground see what was he doing bringing israel out of spiritual egypt what way out all over the world bringing them back into their homeland now let me say this right here that every trumpet that blowed blown under the sixth seal so we'll get into that don't worry about that but all the trumpets because the trumpets are to israel sure we get the spiritual part we get the end gathering and the feasts of pentecost and we get to feast the trumpets right as far as the spiritual aspect bringing us together setting us right here today right what did the feast of trumpets do today it brought you here and then gathering all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew that was a minute or hour that christ would come as he revealed it to us notice now exactly the continuity of the scripture exactly the same under the seventh trumpet is to israel all right look israel gets the trumpets and they get the literal part of the seal but we get the spiritual part of all this right right right under the seventh trumpet is to israel is that is to israel the same as the seventh seal was so it had to already open was to the church we found under the seventh ceiling when those souls that were under the altar there received robes they were given robes not that they earned them because they were in the dispensation when god was still dealing with grace with the gentiles not the jews so that ought to be a key right there to show you the feast of trumpets that the uh fifth sealed jew receives robes right exactly under redemption dealing with grace with gentiles not the jews right because when the gentile door is closed he's going to go to the jews right amen israel is saved as a nation god deals with israel as a nation gentile is a people not a nation for his name so the seventh trumpet let's read before we close let's read revelation excuse me eleven 15 it's not on there but if you can find it real quick in your bible because this is the seventh trumpet to israel is the same as the seventh seal to you and i and the seventh angel sounded and there was great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world for us are become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever amen so that's gonna happen to us before it happens to israel right amen but it happens to israel bringing in the kingdom remember the ten toes the ten toes have to be destroyed ten kingdoms have to be destroyed by the battle of armageddon that's where all of everybody pulls together right there's no united states russia china in the millennium that's god's time that's the kingdom of god being set up not the kingdom of man there's nothing to do with man because what god has purged a bride purged 144 thousand and before that he really purged the fifth sealed jew 144 000 and the earth and now god can ride right down right and the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever you love the lord amen maybe that will help you a little bit when we get into read in the bible about purging psalms 51 says purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be harder than snow psalm 65 3 iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them away amen my mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord man departs from evil proverbs 16 51. just keep reading down through there even in malachi he's talking about purifying of silver and purifying of gold and you may offer that to the lord what a purging purge the old weapon that's what we were talking about right purge the old man let's sing a song 341 greatest he that is greater is he that is is he promises an overwhelming power is he that is greater all of you that are born again that have the power of god inside of you i want you to come up here and touch your prayer clothes before you walk out that head what's been said today and believe what mark 16 says take care of each other in world is is according to marxism is everybody is is
