[0:17] good evening everybody
[0:19] so two Wednesday nights ago brother
[0:21] Terrence mention the request a praise
[0:24] report that we had about a tree that
[0:25] fell on our property and I wanted to
[0:28] give you the testimony than the pictures
[0:32] about that can y'all pull up the first
[0:34] slide please
[0:36] so because what happened was actually
[0:38] very supernatural so it's over the last
[0:41] 10 years gee that's can y'all see that
[0:45] you dim a couple of lights maybe four
[0:48] please so ten years ago Gabby now got
[0:52] married and moved into this little house
[0:54] that we live in and we've been keeping
[0:57] around on that big Hickory tree because
[0:59] it's enormous and because of that little
[1:00] hollow place there at the bottom of the
[1:02] tree but it wasn't any real reason to be
[1:04] concerned right off just because it was
[1:06] a still great live tree very strong now
[1:09] I can't see further way next slide
[1:19] please
[1:19] in March of this year though there came
[1:22] a big wind in the storm and the like a
[1:26] tornado force wind just for about five
[1:28] seconds it's not like a locomotive in
[1:29] our backyard and and we started seeking
[1:32] shelter and then all at once it stopped
[1:34] went out the next day and looked and
[1:35] there was now a big crack in addition to
[1:37] her hollow place down the side of the
[1:39] tree about the first 12 feet of that
[1:42] trunk so we started calling around and
[1:46] thinking you know now it's time to have
[1:47] the tree removed so we called several
[1:49] tree companies go back one side please
[1:53] and what we're just going to do is have
[1:56] them cut the limbs off the top of the
[1:57] tree that would remove the threat so it
[1:59] couldn't reach our house maybe 500 bucks
[2:02] is what I was thinking well they said
[2:03] two to four thousand dollars because
[2:06] they're gonna have to bring in heavy
[2:07] equipment so I said no thank you
[2:08] so they're looking into ways of doing it
[2:11] myself which is somewhat irrational
[2:13] because it'd be very dangerous but
[2:16] anyway in the meantime go to the next
[2:18] slide please
[2:19] just so you know what these are
[2:21] also temporarily as a measure to keep
[2:24] try to keep it from falling our house
[2:25] secured it to two other adjacent trees
[2:27] with log change but that really wouldn't
[2:29] keep it off our house permanently that
[2:30] was just in the meantime till I could
[2:31] get something done all right
[2:34] next slide so here's the setup we've got
[2:39] next slide next slide there's so our
[2:47] house here this is on the back edge of
[2:49] our property can anybody see that okay
[2:51] so our house here oh that's bare
[2:55] neighbor's house here other neighbor's
[2:57] house here our utility building us here
[3:00] barn down there so the tree is
[3:02] surrounded by about five structures so
[3:03] any way it would fall in that direction
[3:05] it would desecrate whatever it would
[3:08] land on because a very lively very heavy
[3:10] full of moisture tree so it would be
[3:13] very damaging
[3:14] I'll stand there all I was doing wasn't
[3:17] thing about the scripture I was standing
[3:18] about in this spot where this picture
[3:20] was taken from looking up at it studying
[3:22] and thinking now what can I do to take
[3:24] this down without hurting myself and all
[3:27] of a sudden the scripture came to my
[3:28] mind where Jesus said Luke 17 6 if you
[3:31] have faith as a grain of mustard seed
[3:32] you shall say to this I thing said sick
[3:35] of entry be thou plucked up by the root
[3:38] and be thou planted in the sea and it
[3:39] should obey you so I looked up at the
[3:41] tree and I thought now I can't fall
[3:43] anywhere over this way without doing
[3:45] damage but back on this side is a
[3:46] dilapidated chain-link fence
[3:49] it belongs to an adjacent commercial
[3:51] property already falling in they don't
[3:54] care about the fence evidently so I said
[3:55] to that tree I just looked up in a quiet
[3:57] voice I said when you fall fall this way
[4:01] I didn't shout I was an anointed I
[4:04] wasn't like anything great God hides in
[4:07] such simplicity that sometimes it can be
[4:08] working through you and you not even
[4:10] know it okay God is really incredible in
[4:13] hiding in simplicity and so much to
[4:15] where you won't even realize when he's
[4:16] working through you well that was back
[4:19] in March or so and I went on and forgot
[4:21] about it now I should also mention that
[4:25] on this side of the tree facing our
[4:29] house most of the limbs are on that side
[4:31] and I'm not talking that little limb
[4:32] some of these limbs are the side
[4:34] of a small tree themselves and some of
[4:36] them shoot 20 or 30 feet out over our
[4:38] yard so all the weight from that side of
[4:40] the tree if you stand here and look up
[4:41] it's got about a four or five degree
[4:44] lean toward our house and then the
[4:46] hollow place in the correct place on
[4:47] that side of the tree so everything
[4:49] every rational thought would tell you
[4:51] that that tree is going to fall on that
[4:53] house okay but I didn't stand there and
[4:55] rationalize about it those things didn't
[4:57] come into my mind I just simply looked
[4:58] up and said when you fall fall this way
[5:02] you know there's a thing in the military
[5:05] I've never been in the military but
[5:06] heard this quote that I like a soldier's
[5:08] duty is not to reason why a soldier's
[5:11] duty is to do or die
[5:13] be desperate or perish but just simply
[5:15] obey what you've been told to do no
[5:17] matter how irrational it seems and the
[5:19] scripture plainly said you just didn't
[5:21] say wood the tree lean that way or make
[5:23] it follow the way it's you know won't to
[5:25] fall in anyway he just said speak to
[5:27] this tree that's it we had a legitimate
[5:29] need we just needed it not fall in our
[5:31] house which wasn't meat temps in God I
[5:32] wasn't testing to see what I could do so
[5:36] next slide please
[5:37] at the same time this was going on I
[5:39] didn't realize this but Gabby was inside
[5:41] the house during the same about the same
[5:44] time telling our kids they said mommy
[5:47] isn't going to fall in our house they
[5:48] said and she said to them no this tree
[5:51] is going to be like Goliath you know in
[5:52] the story of David and Goliath he was
[5:53] struck in the front but he fell forward
[5:56] he should have fallen backward but I
[5:57] believe God had him fall for it because
[5:59] he was defying God the boss says every
[6:01] knee shall bow you know if you defy God
[6:02] he'll bring you to your knees and bring
[6:04] you down and the fact is Goliath forward
[6:06] when he should have fell backwards so
[6:08] Gaby was telling the girls no baby that
[6:10] tree is going to fall backwards the
[6:12] weight was on the phone it researched
[6:14] assault should fall forward she said no
[6:16] it's going to fall backwards so she was
[6:17] making that confession and I was
[6:19] speaking to the tree and we didn't know
[6:21] that either one of us was doing that
[6:22] no but the veil told us to read the
[6:25] message of grace about a week ago I was
[6:26] reading to that about my third time
[6:28] reading that and I've never caught this
[6:30] before sure y'all knew this but this is
[6:32] the second time that brother venomous
[6:34] poke squirrels into existence I always
[6:37] thought it was just that one time
[6:38] but he says I thought right here's where
[6:41] God gave me them squirrels last year to
[6:43] speak into existence took off my hat
[6:44] again and said Lord God you're still the
[6:46] same Jesus you're still
[6:47] some said to me how many do you need
[6:49] this time I said this to the other times
[6:51] limit and then I said I shall have this
[6:53] limit before 10 o'clock today in
[6:55] strangers it seems just then there was a
[6:56] very bad mosquito area grows infested
[6:58] with mosquitoes and kind of a swampland
[7:01] and the great big mosquito came to bite
[7:03] me right by my eye and I said not one of
[7:05] them will bother me this day so speaking
[7:08] the nature and then he went on to say
[7:10] before I knew it and he said the Sun
[7:12] will shine within 30 minutes so brother
[7:14] Brennan speaking to nature three times
[7:15] he's commanded nature and if you read on
[7:17] all three of those things came to pass
[7:19] the squirrels came to existence the
[7:21] mosquitoes went away and the Sun came
[7:23] out so what's happening here Jesus said
[7:25] the meek shall inherit the earth
[7:26] right this is there's a position we're
[7:29] coming to and I believe this is leading
[7:30] up to that now the next slide please
[7:33] this shows you that tree towering over
[7:36] our house it dwarfs the other trees in
[7:39] our backyard it's this middle one right
[7:40] here that's our Goliath okay and this is
[7:44] our little teeny-weeny house and just
[7:48] before I forget to say if the tree were
[7:50] to fall this way we later measure the
[7:52] tree and found out where it would land
[7:53] the top of the tree would be on my
[7:55] Nissan Frontier in our front yard
[7:56] it would have engulfed our house there
[8:02] was another storm that came - Tuesday
[8:06] nights ago 10:30 at night that tree fell
[8:08] now there's only one tree in our
[8:11] neighborhood that we know of that fell
[8:12] there was a lot of wind in a lot of
[8:14] areas I think a lot of damage in North
[8:15] Georgia evergreen street had a tough
[8:18] time there was a lot of trees fell on
[8:19] Green Street but in our neighborhood
[8:21] there's only one tree that we know of it
[8:22] fell very odd the way this happened but
[8:26] that night the girls are already in beds
[8:28] they weren't stomping and running around
[8:29] making noise so there's no reason we
[8:31] should have not heard that tree fall see
[8:33] buddy ever heard of tree fall it's very
[8:36] violent and very awesome it takes down
[8:37] the tops of other trees with it it
[8:39] brings down whole other trees with it
[8:40] and breaks off the limbs of other trees
[8:42] it grabs everything grab on the way down
[8:44] the the the trunk will pop and crack and
[8:47] twist and torque and then finally when
[8:48] it hits the ground it makes a loud thud
[8:50] and you can feel it and your insides
[8:51] shaking if you're within 100 feet of it
[8:53] well none of that okay the girlfriend
[8:58] bed is sleep I was on this end of the
[8:59] house
[9:00] gabi now I was off work that week so I
[9:03] was at home Gabby and I were doing our
[9:04] quiet time on opposite ends of the house
[9:05] I was reading so I was well able to hear
[9:07] the storm and she was on this end but in
[9:10] the back bedroom the most vulnerable
[9:12] position to be in
[9:13] if that tree should fall in the house
[9:15] and she was listening to brother Bob I
[9:18] think in one year she always keeps one
[9:20] ear open she has a hair bud in one ear
[9:22] and she keeps other ear open to hear
[9:23] kids because they get it so we were both
[9:25] able to hear the storm there wasn't a
[9:26] lot of wind at our house it was done but
[9:29] not a lot and then you know just heavy
[9:31] rain and thunder and lightning all of a
[9:34] sudden we heard a pinging sound on the
[9:36] back of her house sounded like little
[9:37] pieces of bark or debris hitting the
[9:38] back of our house where that thing
[9:39] snapped and then we heard Gabby said she
[9:42] heard a few limbs breaking so we ran to
[9:45] the back window and looked thinking that
[9:46] maybe some limbs fell off the tree
[9:47] pitch-black dark about that time to
[9:49] light and lit up the sky
[9:51] and we saw this huge void go to the next
[9:53] slide we saw this great big void where
[9:55] that tree used to stand and it fell
[9:58] exactly where we told it to fall down to
[10:00] the inch exactly the opposite way from
[10:04] our house and I'm telling you I don't
[10:07] know how much wind it would take to make
[10:09] it do that but to overcome the leverage
[10:11] of all those limbs and to write the tree
[10:12] in the first place because it was
[10:13] leaning and bend it backward like that
[10:15] make it fall back had to have taken a
[10:17] lot of wind but there wasn't so next
[10:20] slide go back one go back to this
[10:25] previous slide I'm sorry we measured
[10:27] that next one in the length of the tree
[10:29] to be 95 feet we measured it twice we
[10:32] just walk down the length of the trunk
[10:33] on into that neighbor property nothing
[10:36] over there by the way there's a
[10:37] commercial storage building place down
[10:39] here but nothing else for it to hurt it
[10:42] didn't hurt anything except that fence
[10:43] back there 95 feet and we measured from
[10:45] the stump back this way to our house 60
[10:48] 68 feet so it would have completely
[10:51] consumed our home then now the next
[10:54] slide the closest thing came to is that
[10:56] little cheap metal building of ours real
[10:58] thin metal it came within inches of that
[11:00] just a big piece of the of the Barton
[11:03] splintered off of there thanks slide I'm
[11:06] not a good photographer this the best I
[11:08] could do about getting a side view but
[11:10] basically this is only like the first 10
[11:11] feet of the tree so with your
[11:12] imagination
[11:13] flip that over this way and then add
[11:16] another 85 feet going out that way
[11:18] toward our little house next slide this
[11:22] is just a before and after shot of the
[11:24] life that's before he fell standing nice
[11:26] and strong and then after he fell and
[11:28] there's a little Pentecostal kid dancing
[11:30] in our front yard either because it was
[11:33] the last day of school or because the
[11:34] tree fell next on just a closer up view
[11:42] of the same thing and then the last one
[11:45] is a picture of my mom she came to claim
[11:47] the firewood for the next several
[11:48] winters she's got a fireplace so we're
[11:52] going to try to cut it up and haul it to
[11:53] her house but uh the most amazing thing
[11:55] about this is if you look back to the
[11:57] last sermon that was preached here
[11:59] before that happened it was on May 21st
[12:02] the tree fell on May 23rd May 21st for
[12:05] the wave the second sermon that day he
[12:08] preached the fall and he preached about
[12:10] the title deed he was talking a lot
[12:12] about these things about us coming back
[12:13] to the position that Adam was in before
[12:15] the fall having dominion with fishes in
[12:17] the final the air and so forth not a
[12:20] coincidence jesus said the meek shall
[12:22] inherit the earth and you know what's
[12:24] amazing too about this is I'm not
[12:25] standing here to toot mine and Gabby's
[12:26] horn and say we did anything I'm saying
[12:29] all of y'all have done this before y'all
[12:30] y'all spoken to storms whether spiritual
[12:33] or natural and move things in your own
[12:35] life you know just don't overlook those
[12:38] things cuz god hiding simplicity if you
[12:39] really think you'll realize that God was
[12:41] there working through you and just
[12:43] remember the things because what God
[12:45] wants to forget when he does something
[12:47] it's for purpose you know thank y'all so
[12:49] much for the time raise the lord is he
[12:58] still God amen
[13:00] I appreciate that testimony but Ron I
[13:03] think we all do that all things are
[13:06] possible to them that believe
[13:08] you know butter on I just appreciate
[13:11] their testimony and he's quiet
[13:14] they're just quiet but allowing God to

[23:11] glory for everything father we we praise
[23:15] your great name and we thank you we just
[23:17] ask you to have your way with each one
[23:20] of us and guide us in your understanding
[23:22] and keep us in Jesus name Amen I was
[23:26] thinking while brother Ryan was telling
[23:28] the testimony about the tree and I was
[23:30] leaning but thinking about back in the
[23:32] times you remember when they were
[23:35] killing the Christians and vines and I
[23:37] forgot what age it was in but you
[23:39] remember the story that was told that he
[23:42] said tommy's of the tree on the bottom
[23:43] side he said this time neither and said
[23:47] if I'm God you'll see so the tree was
[23:50] leaning they tied him on the bottom side
[23:51] which is supposed to go
[23:52] they cut the tree and tree fell back up
[23:56] and killed the ones that was and didn't
[23:58] bother the man so I still believe God is
[24:01] real don't you ok Joe - we're very
[24:06] familiar Scripture with us
[24:08] and we'll try to get back into some of
[24:10] this you know to do but says be glad
[24:13] then you children of Zion and rejoicing
[24:16] the Lord your God for yet giving you the
[24:19] former rain moderately and he will cause

[24:49] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[24:53] praise the name of the Lord your God
[24:54] ready yet done all right and it goes on
[24:57] bringing the other to go over now to
[24:59] Malachi very familiar scripture with all
[25:02] of us and I'd like to read verse 4
[25:06] because remember Melek hides the last
[25:09] book of the Old Testament all right now
[25:11] the lice wordings God is giving to the
[25:14] Old Testament alright life's book of the
[25:18] Old Testament the last chapter the Old
[25:20] Testament the last few verses of the Old
[25:22] Testament the reason I like to read
[25:25] verse for me and talks about all the
[25:28] other you'll tread then the ashes of the
[25:29] wickedness thing but said remember you
[25:32] the law of Moses my servant you're
[25:37] ending the Old Testament and God's
[25:39] reminding you to remember because
[25:42] remember who brought the word of the
[25:43] Lord through the Old Testament remember
[25:47] you the law of Moses my servant which I
[25:50] commanded him in Horeb for all Israel
[25:52] and with the statutes and judgments
[25:54] behold I will send you Elijah the
[25:56] Prophet before the coming the Great and
[25:58] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[26:00] turn the heart singular notice of the
[26:03] father's to the children and the heart
[26:06] of the children through your father's
[26:07] let's not come in from out to earth with
[26:09] a curse you may be seated
[26:11] the Lord that is blessing to the reading
[26:14] of the word now I know we won't get to
[26:20] it but
[26:21] I want your thinking to be connected to
[26:23] where we preached two weekends ago and
[26:27] enjoy brother the cash having them with
[26:29] us for the weekend and all it gives you
[26:32] arrest but it helps and everybody you
[26:34] know can can listen and and follow along
[26:37] in maybe his way of bringing things
[26:40] coach you know that's what we believe in
[26:42] but now what was we talking about what
[26:45] have we been talking about for about
[26:47] three services we've been talking about
[26:52] that the children of Israel they
[26:57] rejected the headstone to them because
[27:03] when Jesus Christ come riding into
[27:05] Jerusalem he was the headstone all right
[27:09] and they rejected him crucified him and
[27:13] everything in it it turned out that all
[27:16] of those Old Testament Scriptures who he
[27:18] brought through the Psalms and the
[27:19] things where it was promised that that
[27:22] stone would come all right and that
[27:25] stone is not a rock it's not something
[27:28] like that it's a revelation it's a
[27:30] person Israel rejected the person of the
[27:35] Lord Jesus Christ as being the great
[27:37] eternal God right and they crucified him
[27:44] see then the scripture said that they
[27:46] rejected him and said that stone was a
[27:50] stone of stumbling coming into the New
[27:52] Testament
[27:53] using the wording and a rock of offense
[27:55] and those people actually the people
[28:04] that claim to be the people of God and
[28:06] they were the chosen alike all right
[28:10] everything was okay until they rejected
[28:14] the Messiah now once they did that then
[28:20] that stone that revelation you remember
[28:25] what the scriptures are and Matthew were
[28:28] that that Jesus read who to man say I
[28:31] the son of my name
[28:33] and they said dark the Christ the Son of
[28:37] the Living God then he said to Peter
[28:40] upon this rock I'll build my church
[28:44] now that robbed are as a revelation of
[28:46] Jesus Christ it's not on Peter the
[28:51] Baptist the Methodists and the things
[28:52] like that when a claim is on that and
[28:54] the Catholic wants to claim its own
[28:56] Peter no he didn't say that he said upon
[29:01] this rock I'll build my church and the
[29:02] gates of Hell shall not prevail all
[29:04] right it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[29:06] once they turn God down that was their
[29:10] Messiah right if they reject his sonship
[29:16] and they will never come back as sons
[29:20] and daughters of the Living God as the
[29:24] bride are a sonship they rejected that
[29:27] even 144,000 you go over the revelations
[29:30] they'll come back to be servants they
[29:34] they won't come back because they
[29:35] rejected that part and that's what I've
[29:38] kept asking you and I are cautioning us
[29:41] could we turn down the revelation of
[29:46] Jesus Christ in our day and miss it
[29:49] oh no we believe everything well you
[29:55] know what if you to ask them what they
[29:57] believe they would have told you they
[30:00] believed everything they would have told
[30:04] you that they were looking for a messiah
[30:05] they'll tell you today they're looking
[30:08] for a messiah and they'll tell you that
[30:12] Messiah will be God in human flesh upon
[30:15] the earth we'll see then when they
[30:22] rejected Jesus Christ they lost all
[30:24] rights the Bible says adoption was to
[30:29] Israel
[30:29] the Oracles which is the word of God it
[30:31] came to Israel all of them when they
[30:34] turned it down this reason I would like
[30:35] to reverse forward our Malachi because
[30:38] he's telling you to remember what Moses
[30:42] said
[30:45] remember the law Moses the Word of God
[30:50] right is the the law is that the Word of
[30:52] God the Ten Commandments that's the Word
[30:54] of God that was God in letter form not a
[30:57] bunch of rules to keep that's where we
[30:58] don't understand we think it's something
[31:00] we can do or not do no it wasn't that it
[31:05] was a person they rejected from being
[31:09] their Messiah their God turning that
[31:14] down and when they did he became then as
[31:19] we read in the scripture on those and we
[31:23] can he can pull that up he'd like to but
[31:25] in first Peter it turns out to saying
[31:28] I'll lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone
[31:36] where was that laid out it was rejected
[31:38] by the Old Testament it was laid in the
[31:42] early church on the death pendant the
[31:47] disciples had walked with the Lord Jesus
[31:49] for three and a half years he had taught
[31:52] them the things of the coming kingdom
[31:54] and all of the things that would take
[31:57] place and how he would have to die and
[32:00] you have to give his life of course they
[32:01] didn't understand that that's oh no no
[32:03] then we won't let that out and Peter
[32:05] tried his best to fight for him over in
[32:08] the garden you know whoever grabbed a
[32:09] sword cut off when the high priest
[32:12] guards here you know but see he became
[32:19] the chief Cornerstone he became the
[32:25] cornerstone to the church because that's
[32:29] what Jesus said to Peter he said thou
[32:35] art Peter and upon this rock not him
[32:39] revelation it was it goes on to tell it
[32:42] right the revelation of Jesus Christ
[32:46] alright then we go into the scripture we
[32:49] kept on bringing that out in in
[32:50] Ephesians 2 and 20 how that we're built
[32:53] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[32:55] prophets Jesus Christ being
[32:59] a chief corner stone to you and I today
[33:05] are build upon what those disciples told
[33:10] that's when he said to Peter upon this
[33:14] rock I'll build my church upon this
[33:17] revelation Peter of who I am and who was
[33:21] he use either Almighty God in human
[33:24] flesh are we're the most deceived people
[33:27] in the world oh he's a second person of
[33:31] the Trinity
[33:31] show me the word Trinity in the Bible
[33:33] anyone kind of like a men it worked one
[33:39] time and I'm talking to him about water
[33:40] baptism because we firmly believes and
[33:44] water baptism according to Matthew 28:19
[33:46] no it says in the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:48] Christ I don't we read Father Son and
[33:51] Holy Ghost with father son Holy Ghost
[33:52] Lord Jesus Christ that's sensible he
[33:56] said to baptize in the night but I
[33:57] talking to a man about baptism and I
[34:00] said you realize that early church I
[34:03] said I can show you in your own
[34:04] encyclopedia were that the Catholic
[34:08] Church changed the mood of baptism and
[34:10] let it father son Holy Ghost and I said
[34:14] that early church baptized in the name
[34:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ he said that's
[34:21] right okay I got shotting talk today but
[34:28] actually finish the rest of the sentence
[34:30] I don't think because I walked away cuz
[34:36] you know what he's saying he said that
[34:39] early church was Trinitarians now I'm
[34:43] not joking it's what the man said and he
[34:46] said then being Trinitarians they had to
[34:48] be baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:50] to get him back to one God but said now
[34:54] we baptize father son Holy Ghost call we
[34:56] know who he is and I said so long buddy
[35:00] because anybody would be that carnal to
[35:03] think the early church would be baptized
[35:05] and wrong and the Catholic Church would
[35:10] be baptizing right
[35:12] but it's the way we are anyway we do but
[35:17] listen now Joel try to get into the
[35:23] point jaws that I will restore yours of
[35:29] the cankerworm Palma worm locust the
[35:31] caterpillar now if you read you Bible
[35:33] you know if you're a sensible as a
[35:35] farmer you know that that's four stages
[35:38] of one bug right cankerworm pom worm
[35:41] locust caterpillar as one thing this
[35:43] went through all the cocoons went
[35:45] through all of the changes and turned
[35:47] out it's the same bug because what is
[35:49] Satan showing you what has happened all
[35:53] right and down to the ages we see on the
[35:56] debt Pentecost that they started off
[35:58] with the faith of the fathers the one
[36:00] true Living God how many God did Israel
[36:03] of old house that's why they would kill
[36:06] you if you say anything about a Trinity
[36:08] now because they're not Trinitarians
[36:12] they believe in one true and living God
[36:14] if you asked him about Messiah he will
[36:16] be almighty God because they believe the
[36:21] Scriptures they just don't see it and
[36:25] see then believing it that way then we
[36:28] know that what happened during the ages
[36:31] from the time of Paul and Peter in them
[36:33] coming down through time that's what
[36:37] joel is speaking of because he's
[36:39] speaking of where that old cankerworm
[36:41] pom worm locust caterpillar and all
[36:43] started at the same bug eating it to
[36:45] church you know what would happen to a
[36:48] tree go back and study a little you take
[36:50] a tree and you got a tree and it's got
[36:52] bark it's got leaves it's got this and
[36:55] you go back and think about how that one
[36:56] of those bugs takes the leaves off one
[36:59] of those bug takes some fruit off one of
[37:01] those bug takes the bark off one of them
[37:03] goes and gets the SAP of the tree
[37:05] same old bug that's what Catholicism has
[37:12] done to the church and it went down in
[37:20] state as a true word it was eating away
[37:23] in the church and bringing it
[37:25] but the true word life stood about the
[37:29] first for ages and you get Martin the
[37:33] new at Columba you get meeting like that
[37:38] when Martin st. Martin he would
[37:42] there was great signs and wonders
[37:44] fathered to them
[37:45] the sick healed to d'etre is all kind of
[37:47] things in every service it says about
[37:51] him if you studied your history weighed
[37:54] it ate it down not trying to get a face
[37:56] run through it ate it down until it was
[37:59] really just down to a stump but God said
[38:02] I will restore those things so what did
[38:07] you do
[38:08] he took a man named Martin Luther and he
[38:11] preached the message of the judge shall
[38:14] live by faith and it started a worldwide
[38:18] revival bringing back the life the
[38:23] Congress for messengers of death took it
[38:25] down can one farm or local scatter field
[38:27] for messengers are life's going to bring
[38:29] back Luther Wesley Pentecost and in the
[38:34] word that's why we don't deny any
[38:37] churches in their teaching everybody
[38:40] thanks we're so much against this that
[38:41] or the other
[38:42] I believe what Martin Luther told her to
[38:44] just you live by faith
[38:45] but now I don't believe the other things
[38:46] he told it was not correct I certainly
[38:48] wouldn't agree with Martin Luther said
[38:50] to order take the juice out and kill
[38:51] them because they crucified Jesus crying
[38:53] she things like that is back to that
[38:56] wouldn't be right but now you take the
[39:00] Lutheran Church today and compare it to
[39:02] Martin Luther Wright you take the
[39:06] Methodist Church today and compare it to
[39:08] John Wesley and was teaching when John
[39:11] Wesley said there was no need to even
[39:12] drinking black coffee because there was
[39:14] nothing within it those people were the
[39:18] Word of God for the Iowa right Martin
[39:23] Luther preached the just shall live by
[39:24] faith
[39:25] John Wesley come along you get men many
[39:29] buildings put in there between you bring
[39:31] in the Baptist and then we're bringing
[39:33] back baptism buddy mercy we're still
[39:36] kept it Father Son Holy Ghost because
[39:38] the Catholic Church is
[39:39] one in ordain didn't brother but John
[39:42] Wesley brought the truth of
[39:43] sanctification he's in Azusa Street 1906
[39:49] what we call Pentecostals started a
[39:54] worldwide revival over the guilts and
[39:56] the understanding of the Godhead and the
[39:58] bringing forth of the truth the one true
[40:00] and living God coming back my because
[40:03] God promised it alright but now you got
[40:08] to bring it to the word because the word
[40:11] was what was the eating them so the cane
[40:14] corn pronghorn locust caterpillar for
[40:15] bugs then we come over on those I to
[40:17] Martin Luther see preaching and just you
[40:21] live that's the truth he's one of the
[40:24] church eggs messengers come on get into
[40:27] your Bible and study
[40:28] oh no it's not written in Nara blue
[40:30] turban but just read just history of the
[40:32] age in the time read the message to the
[40:37] age and you'll see that those people
[40:39] with are alright see then it comes back
[40:43] there's got to be the word to be
[40:45] restored
[40:46] alright so now listen when I'm calm I
[40:50] didn't draw said I will restore well the
[40:55] promise is to be restored back what to
[40:57] the word of the Living God and the
[40:59] presence of Almighty God among his
[41:01] church and as that began to be brought
[41:05] forth me the promises dinner the Bible
[41:11] picks up and see that's why we then read
[41:15] Malachi 4 Joe tells you it's going to
[41:21] happen right God is going to restore
[41:27] Malachi tells you how it's going to
[41:30] happen behold I send you Elijah the
[41:35] prophet and he turned the hearts of the
[41:40] children see the fathers fathers to the
[41:45] children we know the scriptures and we
[41:48] were able to place them together see God
[41:52] is promised in
[41:53] his word the five times of the coming of
[41:55] the spirit of Elijah
[41:57] you remember Elijah come forth with the
[42:00] word for the hour Elijah done for
[42:02] miracles
[42:03] read your Bible go back studying Elijah
[42:06] said to Elisha before he passed you
[42:09] remember he was going over and he throw
[42:10] the mantle back to him he said give me a
[42:14] double portion of your spirit he said if
[42:18] you see me go you'll get it so he didn't
[42:20] let him get away he stayed right with
[42:22] him didn't he and Elijah come forth with
[42:25] the spirit of Elijah or alas as the
[42:28] Bible called and when it did he comes
[42:31] forth with that truth Elijah does eight
[42:36] miracles a double portion John the
[42:40] Baptist the Bible said he came in the
[42:43] spirit and power of Elijah
[42:46] Richard Bible he came to fulfill what
[42:51] Isaiah 42 witness right I know it's
[42:55] right into 40 41 42 that John the
[42:58] Baptist come to brain season in the end
[43:03] time that's got to come back because
[43:04] John turned the people from the Old
[43:06] Testament introducing Jesus Christ right
[43:11] and he turned them from the Old
[43:13] Testament and that's why I read Malachi
[43:16] 4 and verse 4 because remember the law
[43:20] of Moses John turned them by pointing to
[43:23] Jesus Christ and saying behold the Lamb
[43:25] of God that takes away the sin of the
[43:27] world he turned them to that new message
[43:31] comes I stood the new message that stood
[43:34] the cornerstone I stood the headstone
[43:36] that stood every time because it was
[43:41] Jesus Christ right and what we say we
[43:46] know that was we'll get to some things
[43:49] later but I'll listen and see we think
[43:54] that mccullen look 1:17
[43:56] he said he'll turn the hearts of the
[43:58] other if we think John turned them
[44:00] backward he turning back under the law
[44:02] you mean he turned them to the faith
[44:07] and turn them back away from it meaning
[44:09] reading scripture it said that they
[44:12] would have to come one and Elijah would
[44:17] be sent in the last days before the
[44:20] burning or else it comes from unto earth
[44:23] with a curse
[44:25] so the forth coming of Elijah had to
[44:27] come in our day to bring us the message
[44:32] received in the felt time it will be in
[44:34] through one of the two witnesses to
[44:36] Israel because it would be Moses and
[44:38] Elijah going to Israel
[44:39] all right are you with me them to follow
[44:43] there's got to be a restoration back to
[44:47] the faith of the Father now ever born
[44:52] again believer I'm trying to make this
[44:54] point so if I don't get into message
[44:56] don't worry I got to preach next two or
[44:58] three services waves going video ever
[45:02] born-again believer is born again at
[45:05] faith that's why Peter over in 2nd Peter
[45:10] II says to those of like precious faith
[45:13] every person enters the pyramid the same
[45:17] at faith we said faith is a revelation
[45:21] revelation is the new birth faith
[45:24] according to Hebrew said what faith is
[45:26] the substance of things hoped for the
[45:28] evidence of things not seen you can't be
[45:32] born again without having faith because
[45:35] faith is a revelation to you of who
[45:37] Jesus Christ is what is the new birth
[45:39] then a revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:41] personally to you it doesn't matter
[45:43] where it would be the days of Martin
[45:45] Luther or whether it would be any of
[45:46] these everybody entered the pyramid of
[45:49] faith but the disciples had been taught
[45:52] for three and I years right and when
[45:57] they did today they were born again was
[45:59] not just to put him at faith it put them
[46:02] right here where it said Holy Spirit
[46:05] so we're built on the foundation
[46:07] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being
[46:09] the chief Cornerstone now come on not
[46:10] take out second Peter take out second
[46:14] Peter if you don't believe it totally
[46:15] you said what do you mean I'm seeing
[46:18] what Peter
[46:20] Peter standing there he said with them
[46:21] of like precious faith the prophet of
[46:24] God said what this is written to the
[46:26] church this is not to the world every
[46:29] born-again believer starts at faith
[46:31] that's why you got to split condition on
[46:34] the Deaf Pentecost
[46:35] you got the 120 in the upper room that
[46:38] were tutored and trained by the Lord
[46:40] Jesus for three and a half years I'm not
[46:43] saying every one of the hundred twenty
[46:45] with our just don't don't get all caught
[46:47] up with any philosophies just listen
[46:51] with that group of people
[46:53] we're born again and when he did God put
[46:56] them right here how's your faith and
[47:00] fathers if not what you're going to
[47:03] restore are you going to agree that
[47:09] Martin Luther had the new birth if
[47:11] you're not you might as well pack up and
[47:14] go home because you ain't even in the
[47:18] story
[47:19] you said you shouldn't don't like why
[47:21] not did Martin Luther house the new
[47:24] birth oh it was just a just a little bit
[47:26] but it was the new birth
[47:31] you can't put what is the new birth
[47:34] justification sanctification and the
[47:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost but look at
[47:38] them never taught it like that no what
[47:39] they come through it you say well now
[47:42] how do you prove that okay I ain't going
[47:44] to argue I'm just going like a statement
[47:46] go on now how many of you sisters and
[47:48] had a baby water blood and life now did
[47:55] any of you ever bypass any of those
[47:57] stages and we're talking about normal
[47:59] birth we talk about caesarean but
[48:01] caesarean still gets the water blood and
[48:03] a lot okay so don't jump up and get all
[48:05] smart etiquette it's be sensible so you
[48:09] can't say that those people didn't have
[48:11] a new work they had the new birth for
[48:14] the word of the hour was birth within
[48:17] them because that's the restoration I
[48:20] know the story I know Martin Luther come
[48:23] out to be and turned out to be a
[48:25] Reformation right on Wesleyan went on
[48:28] the end of Reclamation but it had to
[48:30] start with restoration
[48:32] you won't run around them when he says
[48:34] it Azusa Street turned out to be
[48:36] Reformation and you got to admit they
[48:39] got to baptise for the Holy Ghost
[48:40] cuz the Bible says and he does too but
[48:44] listen trying to get you to think about
[48:48] we're at what we're doing so then Joe
[48:58] tells you it's going to happen now
[49:04] that's why I like things in the Word of
[49:05] God I love to be able to put it in the
[49:10] Word of God and say well Joe said this
[49:14] is going to happen then God comes along
[49:20] and he don't leave it that away he comes
[49:22] alone he puts Malachi in and he tells
[49:25] you how it's going to happen it's going
[49:29] to happen by sending Elijah the Prophet
[49:33] to bring the enzyme message and to turn
[49:36] us back to the face of the Father but
[49:40] remember what it says in Malachi he
[49:42] turned the hearts of the Old Testament
[49:44] to the New Testament message right John
[49:48] introduced Jesus Christ bringing new
[49:49] testament a-c-c then somebody's got to
[49:52] come to turn our hearts back to the
[49:54] original up Aroon experience because
[49:58] remember what I was saying 120 in the
[49:59] Upper Room
[50:00] you see that new but at a higher form
[50:04] than the others because they had the
[50:06] word but the 3000 outside it heard one
[50:09] sermon right you can't put them up in
[50:14] the pyramid other than faith I'll try to
[50:18] explain that for over 40 years and
[50:19] people just look at you like who let's
[50:23] hear you explain I don't mean that
[50:25] sarcastically I mean the truth to show
[50:28] me how this thing to come out of the end
[50:31] to where it can be finished up it's
[50:35] promised that the faith of the fathers
[50:37] would be restored right and that it
[50:42] would come to a place
[50:44] to word it would be built upon the same
[50:46] rock the same revelation of the Apostles
[50:52] now you know yourself that the church
[50:55] world don't teach what Paul taught now
[50:59] right is that sensible like I said about
[51:02] the water baptism I can't even get it
[51:04] straight when Peter we're riding it and
[51:07] Matthew come forth and put it in the pen
[51:09] and the one little thing of water
[51:14] baptism you shall be one person in the
[51:19] Bible that was ever baptized father son
[51:21] Holy Ghost are you in me show me one
[51:29] person in the Bible they were baptized
[51:31] father son holy go I'll write you it I
[51:33] mean baptized tell me any word that
[51:36] anybody ever baptized father son Holy
[51:38] Ghost
[51:39] until the Catholic Church come along
[51:41] starting at 325 AD for 606 show me
[51:45] anybody
[51:47] they were baptizing them the name of the
[51:49] Lord Jesus Christ you show me anybody in
[51:53] the Bible it was baptized father son
[51:55] holy go and I'll give you a check for
[51:56] $10,000 you're welcome that's how sure
[52:03] the Word of God is
[52:04] oh you'll come along and say
[52:07] philosophies of this right let's forget
[52:09] it any time like that you shall be in
[52:10] the Bible we go to the Bible we read the
[52:15] Bible we don't read histories and I when
[52:17] I history will verify where it came from
[52:21] and how it developed see what I'm trying
[52:24] to get them across is what I tried to
[52:26] get across in three messages we can be a
[52:28] blind as a bat and set in claiming I'm
[52:31] in the word what about the doctrines and
[52:37] things of this message and how they took
[52:39] one message and split it all into every
[52:41] kind of thing with all kind of doctrines
[52:44] even saying that Jesus wouldn't God
[52:46] until the River Jordan and then he
[52:48] finally become God
[52:55] now quote your prophet if that wasn't
[52:59] God where we no need a fooling with
[53:04] nothing else but listen upon this rock
[53:10] Matthew 16 says I'll build my church and
[53:13] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[53:15] against what about the wonderful things
[53:19] of doing like I said now watch the point
[53:22] and follow me through the night I'll
[53:23] just get a little bit and then go John
[53:27] tells you what's going to happen Malachi
[53:32] tells you how it's going yeah but he
[53:40] don't stop there see it comes down to
[53:45] our day in our time to understand you
[53:52] get the illustration Malachi tells you
[53:59] how it will be done John the Baptist
[54:02] would come and turn the hearts of the
[54:05] people of the Old Testament to the New
[54:07] Testament message and a lot of those
[54:13] disciples is the Lord Jesus coming over
[54:15] John's convert right those easily one
[54:20] that introduced the Messiah but then
[54:23] somebody's got to come and turn that
[54:25] back to the faith of the Father because
[54:27] you tell me that these churches today is
[54:29] believing in the face of us unless this
[54:30] I don't even preach out there let's
[54:32] preach the message you know what I mean
[54:34] let's stay here you don't need them
[54:36] going off on nobody I'll show with our
[54:38] let's stay here and talk about it let's
[54:40] stay here on the internet and the things
[54:42] and talk about it show me in this
[54:43] message where the people are staying
[54:45] when Hebrews 13:8 that he's the same
[54:47] yesterday today and forever tell me
[54:53] where they're believing it the Prophet
[54:54] brought the message to turn us back oh
[54:58] they'll tell you he come and swept off
[55:01] the foundation and we're got to build
[55:05] the rest of it
[55:08] who's gonna bring forward the hitch time
[55:11] remember the headstone was so rejected
[55:15] until all that could be in the Bride of
[55:17] Christ on the day of Pentecost was a
[55:19] cornerstone right why because the
[55:24] headstone was rejected Jesus Christ was
[55:28] either Almighty God or the biggest
[55:30] deceiver the world has ever had
[55:32] I don't mind statement anyway they must
[55:38] have thought he thought he was God they
[55:40] killed him cause he said he was God
[55:42] right they must've thought he thought it
[55:48] was God
[55:49] that's reason they killed him all right
[55:51] but now listen you know what I'm doing
[55:53] I'm having to bring down and open up a
[55:56] few things and the can of beans to where
[55:57] we can move on right so bear with me all
[56:02] right
[56:03] I've never been like what a lot of
[56:06] preachers a lot of preachers get up here
[56:08] they're going to preach what they gonna
[56:09] preach it don't matter who's sitting in
[56:10] the building no matter where anybody in
[56:12] the building even those anything about
[56:14] what they gonna preach they gonna preach
[56:15] that straight line when the Holy Ghost
[56:17] don't do that I'm just telling you don't
[56:19] do it so I don't worry about it well
[56:20] I've got to let me do it
[56:22] it makes me back up pick up try to do
[56:24] the best I can to help everybody give it
[56:29] understanding and you know what I found
[56:31] out a long time I found out by backing
[56:33] up and going over time that the old ones
[56:36] wasn't getting it with ones the new ones
[56:38] were setting out of saying amen
[56:40] may I I'll do it myself I've been at it
[56:45] 40-something years I don't have to worry
[56:47] about it I mean on that for 40-something
[56:49] years do you try to preach to the old
[56:51] heads of these people of this message is
[56:53] where you get snarled up at oh I don't
[56:57] know who does he think he is well who
[56:59] are you no problem I just made what
[57:05] listen like I said I like to see things
[57:08] in the word then take the word as
[57:11] further advancement and then come out
[57:14] with the end time to where the message
[57:17] compares to all of them scriptures
[57:19] do you understand one of these days
[57:23] you'll understand what I used to do I
[57:26] don't do it as much now because I'm
[57:28] anchored into it all of those that was
[57:32] sitting in the Bible study Saturday
[57:33] heard a statement out of me that you
[57:35] wouldn't hear out of most preachers God
[57:38] used to give me things I'd spend thirty
[57:40] minutes writing a sermon and spending
[57:42] three hours trying to tear it down
[57:47] because if I could tear it down it
[57:50] wasn't right that's why when I preach
[57:52] I'm open like a book that's being what
[57:58] you want to I am what I am that's the
[58:02] best way I can be all right but listen
[58:07] now do you see what I'm talking about
[58:10] Joe says it's going to happen Malachi
[58:14] tells you how it's going to happen and
[58:16] God sends Elijah the Prophet right to
[58:22] turn the hearts of the children then
[58:24] back to the Pentecostal father's so now
[58:30] let's read that one go ahead brother
[58:35] number three a very familiar one with us
[58:43] then you see in church age and it's
[58:46] messenger Malachi 4 and Luke 17
[58:50] I mean revelation Malachi 4 in
[58:53] Revelations 10 7 you can put Luke 17
[58:56] dirty in there easily that's no problem
[58:58] right it's going to do two things one
[59:05] according to Malachi 4 you turn the
[59:08] hearts of the children to the father's
[59:14] now that's what I just went through
[59:16] showing you Joel says it's got to be
[59:20] done because it went down and it's got
[59:23] to be restored Malachi shows you what's
[59:27] going to happen how it's going to turn
[59:29] back and here is the number three stay
[59:33] each of the profit verifying the
[59:36] Scriptures so when you mouth of two or
[59:39] three witness to say these things mouth
[59:44] of two or three witnesses this sealed up
[59:46] you can do what you want good you say
[59:48] life's don't believe it your way with us
[59:50] if yourself is it what the word says if
[59:56] it does argue with the one who wrote it
[59:59] one according to Malachi 4 you turn the
[1:00:02] hearts of the children to the father and
[1:00:08] this is what I love because that just
[1:00:11] leave you to where you could say well
[1:00:12] does this turn this or that turn no god
[1:00:15] finishes it to the mouth of the Prophet
[1:00:18] right number two one thing he's going to
[1:00:22] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:00:24] father's back to the Old Testament I
[1:00:26] mean back to the Apostles doctrine which
[1:00:29] is what I said we're built on the
[1:00:31] foundation apostles and prophets I was
[1:00:36] setting our life in the day because
[1:00:38] there's a Sunday when I was preaching I
[1:00:40] was watching that message and I was
[1:00:42] preaching away how did
[1:00:43] Zachariah was going to build a building
[1:00:45] I figured somebody saves a ruble in a
[1:00:49] minute they didn't say it but I wouldn't
[1:00:51] think you know it then but you don't
[1:00:53] want Zack arrives when it wrote it
[1:00:56] Zachariah wasn't one didn't told truble
[1:01:02] the words of the Lord I just like
[1:01:05] looking ok this is I just old age ok so
[1:01:10] late the two he will reveal the
[1:01:13] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:01:16] Revelation 10 which are the revelation
[1:01:19] contained in the seven seals so you see
[1:01:22] we're not looking for another prophet to
[1:01:23] come or another messenger to rise and
[1:01:25] all of that it's done been done look it
[1:01:28] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:01:31] true the seals is the only way the
[1:01:37] statue of a perfect man can be built you
[1:01:40] can't turn to the face of the father's
[1:01:42] dr. seals coming first he just said
[1:01:49] it would be these divinely real mystery
[1:01:51] troops that literally turned the hearts
[1:01:53] of the children to the Pentecostal
[1:01:56] father's that's why I brought around
[1:02:00] them come forth
[1:02:01] priest the message and had to pass on
[1:02:06] but he preached the message so we're not
[1:02:09] looking for another messenger no we're
[1:02:16] looking to the Word of God
[1:02:17] so you see number three Joel said it
[1:02:22] would take place Malachi tells you how
[1:02:25] it's going to happen if God is going to
[1:02:26] send this messenger and then this
[1:02:29] messenger that comes backs up and tells
[1:02:31] you that's exactly what will take place
[1:02:37] now some of you flip a little bit on the
[1:02:40] head out of the church age book remember
[1:02:43] the church age book never came out to
[1:02:44] laughter the seals broke so there's
[1:02:47] things in that church age book that
[1:02:48] everybody fights against I love it
[1:02:51] they fight against it but there was
[1:02:53] things he said in there that will
[1:02:56] flabbergast you if you really think
[1:02:58] about it because God put that in there
[1:03:02] to be said that away where the people
[1:03:05] could argue over what is what do you
[1:03:09] understand what I'm getting at how is it
[1:03:11] that we could be turned back to the face
[1:03:13] of the father's not God bringing his
[1:03:17] message seals and everything marriage
[1:03:19] aboard all a whole that's enticing on
[1:03:22] and then leaving it into our hands you
[1:03:28] know like this and what he left at the
[1:03:30] FIFO ministries and now you sort of own
[1:03:33] that once all right that's where he left
[1:03:35] it because he said they break it down I
[1:03:37] wouldn't want to send him times and you
[1:03:41] got to argue ahem
[1:03:42] what do you say one two three one two
[1:03:46] three one two an hour think about it
[1:03:56] the early church we've covered it
[1:04:01] started out with the faith of the
[1:04:04] fathers now to show you that it's the
[1:04:10] faith of the fathers and the way it goes
[1:04:11] I'll make one statement to you I never
[1:04:16] use the novice to write the word right
[1:04:23] come on I'm not saying anything wrong
[1:04:28] with that 3000 outside or anything unto
[1:04:31] death Pentecost we take one thing about
[1:04:32] it he didn't use them to write the word
[1:04:34] he used the ones that were in the word
[1:04:38] who brought the word and brought the
[1:04:41] revelation you get over to Peter and
[1:04:44] look at what Peter dude
[1:04:46] Peter's looking at the early church and
[1:04:47] he's saying these people needs to know
[1:04:49] how to get where we're at brothers so he
[1:04:56] preaches the statue of a perfect man as
[1:04:58] we come and your faith virtue knowledge
[1:05:02] temperately bringing you back to the
[1:05:04] faith of the father just because you're
[1:05:06] born again by the new bird that only
[1:05:09] puts you in the body of Christ
[1:05:11] where everybody is put there by the new
[1:05:14] birth but the growth development becomes
[1:05:17] because of the words you hear so now
[1:05:23] it's exactly right then the Prophet
[1:05:25] brought the message went on all to see
[1:05:27] we got the message how are we going to
[1:05:29] be turned back to the faith of the
[1:05:30] fathers well I just need patience
[1:05:32] writers how patient tribulation worketh
[1:05:34] patience that's not exactly what's being
[1:05:39] said if it is we'll just line up and
[1:05:43] start beating each other to death that's
[1:05:46] not tribulation anyway it's the opening
[1:05:50] of God's word that turns a church back
[1:05:52] to the face of the father's are you
[1:05:54] following me the opening of God's Word
[1:05:56] what if it probably had to come to tell
[1:05:58] us this time you realize that six that
[1:06:02] revelation was lost from mankind of the
[1:06:08] second Peter in the
[1:06:09] eighth of the fathers in the Statue of a
[1:06:11] perfect man nobody was teaching at until
[1:06:14] the profit came on the scene and he said
[1:06:17] he preached 30-something years before he
[1:06:19] could preach that you reached out to a
[1:06:21] perfect land see if he did sure he know
[1:06:25] things new things up and down through
[1:06:26] that but uh it's kind of odd that he
[1:06:29] said he just read he said I just got
[1:06:31] this the other day where this fits in on
[1:06:33] something like want the truck he's
[1:06:35] talking about second Peter add to your
[1:06:36] faith virtue knowledge right you see
[1:06:42] Church the message had been delivered
[1:06:44] into our hands but what are we going to
[1:06:47] do with it what are we going to do so
[1:06:53] then we know and see that we need Joel
[1:06:57] says it Malachi tells you how the
[1:07:00] Prophet verifies it that's the way it's
[1:07:02] going to take place let's take another
[1:07:03] little illustration I know we'll give it
[1:07:05] this much tonight so we'll do this we
[1:07:10] know for a certainty of just a statement
[1:07:13] to where you get started even at the
[1:07:17] faith of the fathers of the Apostles the
[1:07:23] headstone had not come in because it was
[1:07:27] rejected
[1:07:35] I'll show you what was rejected Jesus
[1:07:38] preached in matthew 24:6 seals none of
[1:07:44] the Apostles knew anything about show me
[1:07:49] any writing of any apostle other than
[1:07:52] Matthew Mark Luke and John as a recorder
[1:07:55] of the situation showed me even Paul
[1:07:58] mixing me shut up man come on give me a
[1:08:05] buffalo I'm open
[1:08:07] show me any of them talking of son of
[1:08:09] man but what about a little profit walk
[1:08:14] out there in the earliest we've got his
[1:08:15] 47 and I think I looked it up when
[1:08:17] diamonds either 48 or 49 he started
[1:08:20] talking about sort of plan could it
[1:08:28] leave that was a revelation that was
[1:08:29] missing and worried about it but I know
[1:08:34] it's truly a boy's mission that's why
[1:08:37] they couldn't follow Frodo random in his
[1:08:39] ministry he would talk about the Word of
[1:08:44] God and how it would be standing there
[1:08:45] and it would show and reveal and be done
[1:08:48] and and the signs would go with it I got
[1:08:51] one written over here later I'll get to
[1:08:53] it but I want to say this to you let me
[1:08:55] just hit my mind you know what read
[1:08:57] around says Luke 1730's assigned he said
[1:09:04] Malachi 4 is the voice that's in the
[1:09:08] message portion design melikhaya
[1:09:17] is the lawyers
[1:09:20] Luke 1730 was the sign of the Son of Man
[1:09:23] which is the resurrection sign Malachi 4
[1:09:27] is the voice in the days of the voice of
[1:09:31] the seventh angel Melek are saying what
[1:09:38] behold I send you Elijah the pride in
[1:09:42] he'll bring this word to you to the
[1:09:45] church in the church being able to
[1:09:46] receive let's take another situation
[1:09:52] just for a minute I know this will
[1:09:54] probably basically finish it so we'll
[1:09:55] hold the notes until Sunday and preach
[1:09:57] on okay let's read another scripture and
[1:10:02] let's see if it follows the same pattern
[1:10:05] as we've been using that a scripture
[1:10:09] declares something is going to take
[1:10:14] place you go on over into the word and
[1:10:18] it will unfold into deeper things then
[1:10:23] the prophet will come and give us the
[1:10:25] correct understanding come on you maybe
[1:10:34] never talk to anybody about millicom
[1:10:37] over in Luke 17 30 very much to
[1:10:39] understand this one you ever talk to him
[1:10:41] about my look how forward and they said
[1:10:42] John the Baptist Luke 1:17 they knew it
[1:10:45] cuz scripture said he turn the hearts of
[1:10:47] the joy in that
[1:10:49] it's obedient unto the kind of and said
[1:10:51] they could see he turned at this waiting
[1:10:53] he turned it right back well that turn
[1:10:56] of the Old Testament to the Uni coming
[1:10:58] right back no and your prophet said that
[1:11:01] to do so but listen go ahead with number
[1:11:07] number forward
[1:11:12] I want to bring in to you one thing that
[1:11:16] is astounding to me very wonderful piece
[1:11:21] of little machinery that goes in the
[1:11:23] Word of God do you know
[1:11:29] now say this it was the first one who
[1:11:35] come up with the point of restoring the
[1:11:38] temple and don't start jump into his
[1:11:43] rule and try to figure it out
[1:11:45] just listen go to Ezra they don't have
[1:11:50] to put it up who was it in Ezra one and
[1:11:59] one who first talked about restoring the
[1:12:04] temple Israel one and one now in the
[1:12:10] first year of Cyrus king of Persia that
[1:12:15] the word of the lord by the mouth of
[1:12:18] jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord
[1:12:23] stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
[1:12:26] Persia then he made a proclamation
[1:12:29] throughout all his kingdom and put it
[1:12:33] also in writing so you'll find it in
[1:12:36] chronicles if you look in your Bible I'm
[1:12:39] reading from Ezra back up three verses
[1:12:42] in chronicles and he told you the same
[1:12:44] time thus says Cyrus king of Persia and
[1:12:51] I love to hiss he thank the bottle later
[1:12:55] right when he said I put in King I take
[1:12:57] out king look what this King says the
[1:13:04] Lord God of heaven has given me all the
[1:13:09] kingdoms of the earth turning Ezra if
[1:13:14] you want to read it and they got it up
[1:13:15] here okay kind of here
[1:13:17] thus says Cyrus king of Persia the Lord
[1:13:20] God in heaven has given me all the
[1:13:22] kingdoms of the earth and he has charged
[1:13:24] me to build him a house at Jerusalem
[1:13:28] which is in Judah
[1:13:29] he's charged me a he turn King
[1:13:41] and he said who is there among all of
[1:13:44] his people he is God be with him and let
[1:13:47] him walk to Jerusalem which is in Judah
[1:13:49] and build the house of the Lord God of
[1:13:52] Israel he is the God which is in
[1:13:58] Jerusalem read on through you'll find
[1:14:04] out that he emptied all of his treasures
[1:14:08] he paid for the temple to be restored he
[1:14:14] emptied all of his treasures to pay for
[1:14:17] it even gave them back the vessels that
[1:14:22] Babylon had taken in the captivity with
[1:14:28] Jerusalem I mean that's Bible Ricci Baba
[1:14:38] the healer and King is recalling saying
[1:14:42] God laid on my heart to build him a
[1:14:46] house in God did it and he supplied the
[1:14:53] material
[1:14:59] okay
[1:15:00] it ought to be number one remember
[1:15:06] number one was your promise in the
[1:15:11] restoration snackin was America third
[1:15:17] was brought a random explaining it so
[1:15:21] there's number one the King tell them
[1:15:24] the building now let's go to Shaka brah
[1:15:32] let's read a little bit and Zach a rifle
[1:15:35] and the angel that talked with me came
[1:15:38] again to wake me the man as a man that
[1:15:41] is awakened out of his sleep and said
[1:15:44] unto me what see us now not who get him
[1:15:47] down here a little bit but you know what
[1:15:49] happened when when there in Israel that
[1:15:52] it was required to do it
[1:15:54] they wrote her to wrote a whole bunch of
[1:15:55] them eggs like I forgot seven or eight
[1:15:57] thousand of the people known always way
[1:15:59] under two hundred seven thousand all the
[1:16:01] children of Israel went up to build that
[1:16:03] temple it's removable was the leader he
[1:16:08] was the governor he was the leader a
[1:16:13] look he sent him to me what she is down
[1:16:17] I said I have looked and behold a camera
[1:16:19] stick all of gold with a bold upon the
[1:16:22] top of it any seven lamps their own in
[1:16:24] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[1:16:26] on the top thereof and two olive trees
[1:16:29] by it went up on the right side of the
[1:16:31] boat and the other from the left side so
[1:16:35] I answered and spake to the angel that
[1:16:38] talked with me saying what are these my
[1:16:41] lord now listen we just look at it and
[1:16:47] we want to run down to the rubble in the
[1:16:50] parks now we should read that I've asked
[1:16:54] you to to read it I emphasize Zachariah
[1:16:59] for to read it I roll it back down
[1:17:04] brethren let's just say something what
[1:17:08] about from here here
[1:17:13] three verses he covers the entire
[1:17:17] journey of mankind all the way 144,000
[1:17:29] and the two witnesses it's not playing
[1:17:36] folks you don't read like that maybe
[1:17:38] it's not meant for you to read but at
[1:17:40] least you're to read behind me look
[1:17:43] ain't going to talk when they came and
[1:17:45] wake me and when I said unto to watch
[1:17:47] the Istana said I have looked and behold
[1:17:49] a candlestick all of gold revelation
[1:17:54] seven golden candlesticks right then the
[1:17:58] bowls on either side and the vault upon
[1:18:05] the top of it remember seven lamps are
[1:18:07] owned and selling pipes to the seven
[1:18:09] left we jump on the table there and two
[1:18:11] olive trees now where you won't jump
[1:18:14] ahead I'll go ahead and say it
[1:18:15] the two olive trees first number one is
[1:18:18] the old and new Testament right that's
[1:18:25] why you don't want to run it with the
[1:18:26] book of Revelation and make it just the
[1:18:28] two businesses you got to give them to
[1:18:30] it insist something to say the old and
[1:18:33] the new testament now i'm quote rotor
[1:18:35] Branham on that and that's been part of
[1:18:37] here if that's the old in the New
[1:18:41] Testament the two olive trees but then
[1:18:45] when it comes to finality the two olive
[1:18:47] trees wind up to be the two prophets to
[1:18:50] Israel follow me and listen the two
[1:18:55] olive trees I know they don't up now the
[1:19:00] angel that talk when the answer in the
[1:19:02] Senate to me no it's not now not what
[1:19:04] these be and I should know my lord any
[1:19:10] incidence back unto me saying this is
[1:19:13] the word this up here is a description
[1:19:17] of what will happen through time who
[1:19:22] show the very beginning over to the very
[1:19:26] ending
[1:19:26] time you know it's all about the two
[1:19:30] witnesses is the lies we have time
[1:19:32] matter then we know that well we only
[1:19:34] have earthly journey picking those up
[1:19:37] and taking them into the millennium
[1:19:40] listen
[1:19:41] what is this did you sing well I saw
[1:19:43] seven golden candlesticks and I saw two
[1:19:46] angels and I saw two lampstands and
[1:19:48] that's all this when the Prophet said
[1:19:53] well remember in Bible study other night
[1:19:56] we were talking about you know that
[1:19:59] Moses went up into heaven and got the
[1:20:05] pattern and come back built the temple
[1:20:07] that right now what did Moses see in
[1:20:10] heaven a temple or a person he's I hope
[1:20:17] we'll see you're not listening Moses saw
[1:20:22] Jesus Christ and came back to earth and
[1:20:25] could not put it in words what he saw so
[1:20:29] he put it in stone don't you think he
[1:20:35] was standing there watching them
[1:20:36] somebody move aboard and started doing
[1:20:39] these old it holding what Moses you see
[1:20:43] this up never know but that don't fit
[1:20:45] the rest
[1:20:47] there's temple so you're not bringing
[1:20:50] out what I'm talking about that's just
[1:20:53] money okay the answer to take this is
[1:20:57] the word of the Lord unto rouble saying
[1:21:00] not by might nor by power but by my
[1:21:05] spirit says the Lord of Hosts that's all
[1:21:08] of this summed up in that many words
[1:21:13] then look at those words as they finish
[1:21:18] go art Thou O great mountain before
[1:21:21] zerubabbel
[1:21:22] I shall become a flame and he shall
[1:21:26] bring forth the headstone thereof with
[1:21:28] shoutings crying grace grace into it
[1:21:32] who's going to bring the headstone the
[1:21:34] ruble no one said
[1:21:38] who are no great mountain for drew but I
[1:21:40] said come to play and he she'll bring
[1:21:43] forward you said well that's Jesus okay
[1:21:44] fine no problem we got it this right but
[1:21:46] this is a rule because there was a man's
[1:21:50] rule building a literal temple so you
[1:21:53] had to have the literal to be able to
[1:21:55] have the spiritual come on
[1:21:59] read your Bible sometime but he says and
[1:22:02] he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:22:04] thereof
[1:22:04] why didn't it say he's folks for praying
[1:22:06] the cornerstone let me asking you the
[1:22:16] question why didn't it say he shall
[1:22:18] bring forth corn we're going to read
[1:22:20] down here it does tell it to lay the
[1:22:22] foundation then we're going to read read
[1:22:26] around with what he says okay moreover
[1:22:30] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[1:22:31] the hands of Giroud will have laid the
[1:22:34] foundation of this house his hands shall
[1:22:38] also finish it
[1:22:42] he said what are the cornerstone even
[1:22:48] the ruble by the word of God I'll just
[1:22:53] say it this way evident in one of the
[1:22:54] prophets were standing with him because
[1:22:56] only those prophets knows where the
[1:22:58] temple is to be built now I'll quote you
[1:23:01] the guy that Curtis was over in Israel
[1:23:03] he said Elijah is to come and precede
[1:23:09] ammos the Moses to bring this temple and
[1:23:12] he said Elijah will tell us work to put
[1:23:15] the temple thanks a prophet once you
[1:23:22] think about carnality just a little bit
[1:23:25] they destroyed the temple right they
[1:23:29] rolled off everything but did they care
[1:23:31] up all those foundation stones and I did
[1:23:36] safe and others stated it was a one
[1:23:39] stone left that was not totally
[1:23:42] annihilated that's all they needed to be
[1:23:45] able to reconstruct a temple on the same
[1:23:49] spot just give you a little something
[1:23:52] well if they just had one time that
[1:23:57] could restore it I was so amazed when a
[1:24:01] lady when we were over there and we were
[1:24:04] looking at pottery and things in an
[1:24:05] arena where they had killed a Christian
[1:24:07] who died in such a surreal anyhow oh and
[1:24:15] that lady I picked up some pieces of
[1:24:17] pottery and she said listen see if you
[1:24:20] can find me a quarter or piece a little
[1:24:23] tip of a handle of a piece of pottery
[1:24:27] said I can restore it back to original I
[1:24:33] thought oh okay we found a large stone
[1:24:37] all right
[1:24:40] total rule bullets to bring forth the
[1:24:42] headstone in these hands has laid the
[1:24:47] foundation okay because that's the word
[1:24:53] of the Lord now let's read this one and
[1:25:01] then we'll quit this is why I asked you
[1:25:04] to read it's called the message of grace
[1:25:06] I just said message of grace on it and
[1:25:08] something misunderstood but it's the
[1:25:10] message of grace I just forget sometimes
[1:25:11] let's read what your prophet had to say
[1:25:13] about this Zachariah and listen real
[1:25:19] careful to what he says we're all
[1:25:22] acquainted with this scripture that
[1:25:24] reads the Bible we know that this was
[1:25:27] during the time of the preparation
[1:25:29] restoration of the temple and Dhruva
[1:25:32] bull was a great prince among the people
[1:25:34] who had laid the foundation of the
[1:25:37] building listen and now won't you to put
[1:25:44] on your spiritual thinking anointing
[1:25:47] jacket this morning as we think this
[1:25:50] Great Prince had determined to rebuild a
[1:25:53] house of the Lord and then when he did
[1:25:56] he had laid the foundation stone
[1:26:03] roll it over and as we read on further
[1:26:10] we find that God said ruble has laid the
[1:26:12] foundation with his hands he also shall
[1:26:16] bring forth the headstone I want you to
[1:26:20] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:26:23] forth the cornerstone he shall bring
[1:26:30] forth the headstone
[1:26:38] you read if you notice now he didn't say
[1:26:42] running forward to Cornerstone see the
[1:26:45] cornerstone was already laid brother
[1:26:51] branham never come to lay the
[1:26:52] cornerstone because the cornerstone was
[1:26:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:26:58] faith of the father's given to the
[1:26:59] disciples so he never had to lay the
[1:27:04] cornerstone the cornerstone was already
[1:27:07] laid we just got away from it and
[1:27:09] Malachi says we're going to turn back to
[1:27:11] the cornerstone I want you to notice
[1:27:18] something else as Malachi ends the Old
[1:27:21] Testament jaw said it would take place
[1:27:24] Malachi tells you how the headstone was
[1:27:28] rejected and there was no way the church
[1:27:34] could come to the headstone now your
[1:27:39] prophet do you want oh my god I'm late
[1:27:41] for everybody when I say something that
[1:27:43] start he said the headstone was rejected
[1:27:47] he said but it became the cornerstone
[1:27:50] see this is what we want to do we want
[1:27:54] to take this stone because it's shaped
[1:27:55] like this and turn it up here and put it
[1:27:58] up here or put this stone down here for
[1:28:01] heaven's sake don't move nothing and
[1:28:05] I'll give you a carnal illustration that
[1:28:07] you don't move anything
[1:28:08] would you mind redrawing that picture
[1:28:11] and would you hit that put that
[1:28:13] headstone down on there you realize what
[1:28:20] you'd have you'd have that right there
[1:28:23] leave that headstone where it's at we
[1:28:27] got to grow up into him who is the head
[1:28:31] the Bible says you bring it down you're
[1:28:34] going to make your shapes different just
[1:28:36] plain Carlos finish listen you notice he
[1:28:43] never said he'll bring forth the
[1:28:44] cornerstone is you'll bring forth the
[1:28:46] headstone and we know that the scripture
[1:28:49] says that Jesus is the chief Cornerstone
[1:28:52] and he's also the headstone and now if
[1:28:56] we would think for a few minutes that
[1:28:59] the 7th church messenger was to restore
[1:29:01] the faith of the children back to the
[1:29:04] father's in other words rebuild the
[1:29:09] church again under the power of the
[1:29:11] Spirit is that what we've been talking
[1:29:14] about is that what I've been talking
[1:29:17] about America I want it done
[1:29:19] listen not by power not by might but by
[1:29:22] my spirit saith the Lord
[1:29:24] not my organization not by denomination
[1:29:26] but by the Holy Spirit God will bring
[1:29:29] forth the church in the last days the
[1:29:32] robe of the Prince with Joshua was the
[1:29:35] one that was to bring forth this
[1:29:37] headstone he had laid the foundation now
[1:29:43] what does he call it
[1:29:45] he took the people back to the
[1:29:50] foundation in time he never had to
[1:29:55] relate the cornerstone you don't listen
[1:29:59] to what I'm saying
[1:30:00] see we talk about cornerstone we think
[1:30:03] we know all about it we think this is a
[1:30:04] cornerstone right here and this is the
[1:30:07] headstone up here what the games will
[1:30:10] then walk up in front of one of those
[1:30:12] banks and try to find me a cornerstone
[1:30:18] well it's the corner it was the corner I
[1:30:20] thought no it's not it's the plaque that
[1:30:23] tells you us in the building's about
[1:30:25] where's your cornerstone he says first
[1:30:29] nice nobody establish or anoint your
[1:30:31] nerves you go under stone right you know
[1:30:38] that an archway and you put the Keystone
[1:30:40] in the property call to the cornerstone
[1:30:42] and can call it the headstone or an
[1:30:46] archway and put the stone in the middle
[1:30:48] you remember how to cut down this s in
[1:30:51] the middle holds it together that's why
[1:30:53] we think we've got it all figured out
[1:30:55] because we're talking we're not talking
[1:30:57] about stones we're talking about a
[1:31:00] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:31:03] those are samples had the revelation of
[1:31:06] Jesus Christ personally to them by him
[1:31:10] walking with him and teaching him and in
[1:31:12] the Holy Spirit Quicken
[1:31:17] it's not just stones stones or
[1:31:23] revelation upon this rock I'll build my
[1:31:26] church
[1:31:27] well you probably said he didn't say he
[1:31:30] bring the cornerstone coach Jesus Christ
[1:31:32] as the chief Cornerstone you say yeah
[1:31:36] but that was eight down he was in the
[1:31:38] stone it never took it totally away to
[1:31:44] get down into the stump and then God
[1:31:47] began to reveal I just given you a
[1:31:48] natural story when his rule got back
[1:31:52] there he looked and he said where was
[1:31:55] the temple and so I he just sold it out
[1:32:00] here and started heaven help you in your
[1:32:06] spirituality that are so carnal he
[1:32:11] searched until he found the original
[1:32:14] foundation and it didn't matter what
[1:32:18] stone he found he knew exactly what
[1:32:22] happened tell you those pyramids and the
[1:32:25] things and how perfectly ever stone was
[1:32:30] in place you show me one stone I'm gonna
[1:32:34] get technical with you show me one stone
[1:32:38] I know the violin I know what your
[1:32:40] prophet is said not everything but I got
[1:32:42] a little sense of him talking about the
[1:32:44] stone and the sight show me in the
[1:32:48] temple where their stone was left out or
[1:32:51] the natural temple
[1:32:57] do you think you know all about it show
[1:33:00] me where the tone was left out of the
[1:33:01] temple
[1:33:02] show me the cornerstone left out of any
[1:33:04] of those pyramids because it's not
[1:33:09] stoned its revelation he said upon this
[1:33:13] rock upon this dog I'll build my church
[1:33:15] and the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:33:18] against that Church oh yeah they can
[1:33:21] beat her down they can do everything in
[1:33:23] order which they can't destroy because
[1:33:25] God ordained it and it will be just
[1:33:30] remember what he said he didn't say he'd
[1:33:33] bring the cornerstone minor cornerstone
[1:33:35] was already laid in the Apostle right
[1:33:37] around him didn't have to come back and
[1:33:39] bring us a new Bible
[1:33:45] we didn't come and get it william
[1:33:47] branham translation he says this King
[1:33:53] James Version is perfect in every form
[1:33:58] the ends and the Bucks is in the right
[1:34:00] place he said can you show me like show
[1:34:05] me one contradiction don't be a garbage
[1:34:09] can in your mind and I'm gonna show me
[1:34:12] where the worth it
[1:34:13] the Bible was all messed up I said
[1:34:16] before we start don't come up with two
[1:34:19] blind man by Martin one blind man by
[1:34:21] Matthew well he didn't do that you know
[1:34:26] we come
[1:34:26] he's an untraditional he said here it
[1:34:29] says it that David had three thousand
[1:34:32] charge so here he said he had forty
[1:34:34] thousand some thing I said not to do but

[1:37:18] open door policy he cooked right through
[1:37:21] the middle of it and made our opening
[1:37:24] and right there in the door right
[1:37:31] in that door I came down through that
[1:37:33] because I wanted to see if he was
[1:37:35] telling the truth
[1:37:36] I walked down through that I looked over
[1:37:38] in there and he says come on hear me a
[1:37:42] little peon out on the plant you know he

[1:38:13] are open you don't agree with something
[1:38:16] I say tell me don't come to Miami but
[1:38:19] once you tell me go tell the world just
[1:38:21] do that just tell me and then you go
[1:38:23] tell anybody you want to it's no problem
[1:38:27] but you see I've made a report to you
[1:38:30] today on one time Joel said it would
[1:38:33] happen Malachi tells how it's gonna
[1:38:35] happen go to random shows how it would
[1:38:37] happen in his own ministry the Bible
[1:38:44] speaks of ative of Israel and telling I
[1:38:46] was going to build a temple and a
[1:38:49] heathen King was going to supply the
[1:38:50] material God is going to make them do it
[1:38:55] he laid a burden on that man's heart I'm
[1:38:58] just honest I believe he'll get eternal
[1:39:00] life if you want to do a cup of water in
[1:39:04] my name he'd have a lot of cup of water
[1:39:07] but listen in Zachariah tells you about
[1:39:14] zerubabbel rebuilding the temple rouble
[1:39:21] represents the end time gnashing jerk
[1:39:29] because who's going to bring the head
[1:39:31] stop who's going to bring the system and
[1:39:40] we know for certain brother brown
[1:39:41] without the headstone we're going to
[1:39:43] sense know that we're not the headstone
[1:39:47] we hit stone people we went on headstone
[1:39:50] as lively stones you know we know you
[1:39:54] listen
[1:40:03] you know what I've said it to you over
[1:40:04] and over and I'll say it real fast I've
[1:40:10] always believed since I read it seen it
[1:40:13] at this prophets message is the
[1:40:18] headstone to the church notice
[1:40:22] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:24] the apostles and prophets were the
[1:40:27] foundation because it was a revelation
[1:40:30] that's Jesus Christ this prophet come to
[1:40:34] brain what wood blocks down through
[1:40:35] there and the things of Matthew 24 we
[1:40:38] were talking about that Jesus preached
[1:40:40] six seals and none of the disciples
[1:40:41] understood nothing none of them spoke of
[1:40:44] the seals even the great Apostle Paul
[1:40:47] never spoke of it we get us to be
[1:40:53] brought in the end time and I've always
[1:40:56] made this statement and it sounds
[1:40:57] comical but it's a means of God's on his
[1:40:58] crew if everybody in the world seven
[1:41:02] billion people had the faith of the
[1:41:04] fathers it would be a wonderful world to
[1:41:06] live in but there is no headstone to cut
[1:41:10] off the church to change the body if the
[1:41:14] son showed me where it say now you get
[1:41:18] what I'm talking about I'm not sarcastic
[1:41:19] I'm just coming true you come tell me
[1:41:21] well I think it's going to be this way
[1:41:22] brother there well that might be
[1:41:23] involved in what you're talking about
[1:41:25] but I'm talking about the headstone what
[1:41:29] is the headstone brought around can't be
[1:41:30] the headstone will you smash this key
[1:41:34] because remember what he says in the
[1:41:39] days of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:41:41] begin to sound the mysteries of God
[1:41:43] should be finished
[1:41:51] remember what we brought out trying to
[1:41:53] do God a service without his wheel
[1:41:56] mistress to be revealed not when he
[1:42:01] starts out doing this but when he begins
[1:42:05] to sound his message works his faith
[1:42:15] expressed our of the seventh angels
[1:42:19] message when he begins to sound forth
[1:42:21] the message not in a healing service but
[1:42:27] the message that follows the healing
[1:42:29] service how many times you only to quote
[1:42:33] read around them as the bait on the hook
[1:42:34] you remember you don't show them the
[1:42:37] hook cuz you're on the bait on the hook
[1:42:39] they get caught they got caught people
[1:42:41] did buy this message by sitting
[1:42:43] listening and seeing the signs and
[1:42:45] wonders and some people stayed with it
[1:42:47] you are proof of it I don't understand
[1:42:50] it that way that's honor to you you
[1:42:52] stayed with it when the rest left the
[1:42:56] message I have heard but now I see when
[1:42:59] the seller's angel begins to sound his
[1:43:01] message not the healing service the
[1:43:05] message that follows the healing service
[1:43:12] then what are you taking this to be a
[1:43:15] backup over these so good work if they
[1:43:19] can get to our quick enough on number
[1:43:20] six which starts a man here that can
[1:43:22] turn on relies Luther's manner was the
[1:43:25] message of justification Wesley's
[1:43:29] message was the manifestation of
[1:43:30] sanctification Pentecostals was a
[1:43:33] restoration of gifts but this is
[1:43:35] introducing the headstone introducing
[1:43:44] the headstone standing in a gap he said
[1:43:48] in a church it was the cornerstone in
[1:43:51] the full church it was the headstone it
[1:43:57] never did come because it was rejected
[1:44:05] who come to come to her is the mystery
[1:44:09] of godliness the true vine with the
[1:44:15] fullness of the Spirit and the word will
[1:44:17] do the very action powers that Jesus did
[1:44:21] the NS she nears her headstone becoming
[1:44:25] like him through the word Jesus will
[1:44:28] come and the bride and groom be there
[1:44:31] forever
[1:44:34] the dynamics of this church will be
[1:44:36] refilling of the Holy Spirit that we
[1:44:38] have worked in a small measure while the
[1:44:40] headstone is coming down to unite with
[1:44:42] the body but when the head and body
[1:44:44] unites together the full power of the
[1:44:46] Holy Ghost will raise her up Christ the
[1:44:53] mystery of God revealed I love this
[1:44:54] therefore it's the word or nothing
[1:45:00] that's right so what is the headstone
[1:45:03] that that's right he the word how do you
[1:45:09] know it's right
[1:45:09] he the word is vindicated see he the
[1:45:13] word properly vindicated is the headship
[1:45:16] the head of the church he is the word
[1:45:21] the headstone
[1:45:28] what about continuing on down into that
[1:45:30] message we don't let Louis other thing
[1:45:38] 29 hold it then our head chef is a
[1:45:42] kingdom the kingdom of God is within you
[1:45:46] that the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are
[1:45:48] not a denomination we belong to the
[1:45:50] kingdom and the Kingdom is the word of
[1:45:52] God made spirit and life in our own life
[1:45:55] bringing device every promise in this
[1:45:57] days as it did in that day when the word
[1:45:59] and God was one and the word and God is
[1:46:01] one in his church today making it the
[1:46:04] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:46:06] bring the message in the last day
[1:46:11] I thought we believed according to cross
[1:46:18] the mystery of God revealed that the
[1:46:21] bride was part of the mystery well then
[1:46:26] she's got to be revealed I'll end with
[1:46:29] this room crisis the mystery of God
[1:46:32] revealed paragraph 555 number 11 hey
[1:46:37] there's only one thing can happen there
[1:46:41] has to be a message at the end time
[1:46:45] there's nothing else can follow the
[1:46:52] nomination can't follow this message you
[1:46:56] and I can't follow it with our carnality
[1:46:57] stand together maybe I got enough there
[1:47:01] I'll continue on something there you
[1:47:04] don't understand it then get these notes
[1:47:06] it's like the hidden bodies to unite in
[1:47:10] the last days to bring the message yeah
[1:47:14] but I just don't see it what is it does
[1:47:16] that make it's not true because you
[1:47:20] don't see it does that make it not true
[1:47:24] I got a five dollar bill in my pocket
[1:47:29] then nobody in here can see it and I
[1:47:33] can't either
[1:47:39] does that mean it's not true
[1:47:45] you see what I'm talking about that's
[1:47:48] why we can turn down the cornerstone and
[1:47:50] there's no need of talking about the
[1:47:53] headstone until the cornerstone is
[1:47:58] probably into reality or the faith of
[1:48:01] the father's the church to be turned
[1:48:03] back to the original faith this message
[1:48:08] is the headstone to the church is what
[1:48:10] I've always stated my report has always
[1:48:13] been that this church this message is
[1:48:16] our head the faith of the fathers was a
[1:48:18] head back diet of the church Luther's
[1:48:21] just shall live by faith was added of
[1:48:23] that day this message is the head to the
[1:48:26] church then why are we studying murder
[1:48:28] Dominic could try to find a message I'm
[1:48:33] told awful nobody we're telling the true
[1:48:35] one man said when Tommy said I couldn't
[1:48:37] get a message at all so I went down to
[1:48:39] Walmart walked around said got a message
[1:48:40] you know what he preached on when
[1:48:42] addressing her I'm not going on for me

[1:48:51] around look try to find a message I walk

[1:49:01] sleep but 30 minutes for an hour come on

[1:49:10] because I want this message they don't
[1:49:15] want you to understand one thing for
[1:49:18] sure about me I believe this message is
[1:49:21] a headstone we're not looking for
[1:49:22] another stone it's this message that

[1:49:52] life see the faith of the father's can
[1:49:58] bring us back to that place but yet
[1:50:01] there's got to be something to change
