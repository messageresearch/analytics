[27:05] what sermon that you're on so that's
[27:06] okay I think brother Donnie is only like
[27:09] 254 or so so so 85
[27:14] oh okay
[27:15] so in the beginning was the word worms
[27:17] with God and the Word was God and the
[27:19] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[27:21] we behold his glory
[27:23] the glory of the only begotten of the
[27:25] father
[27:25] full of grace and truth he maybe said
[27:27] you know there's nobody can say that but
[27:29] us do you think for one moment that that
[27:33] day beheld his glory as he was here on
[27:35] the face of the Earth he was a human
[27:37] being
[27:38] he was he that he was a common man a lot
[27:41] of people didn't even know who he was uh
[27:44] the twelve that was with him still had
[27:46] questions in their mind so we beheld his
[27:49] glory we actually are the only people on
[27:52] the face of the Earth that know his full
[27:53] Glory we're the only ones that know his
[27:55] full potential we're the only ones that
[27:57] know his character to the degree of
[28:00] having that headstone come back into
[28:02] this church into the people and give us
[28:06] rapturing Faith that's what we're
[28:08] heading to we're heading to Rapture in
[28:09] faith all right so as we're heading to
[28:11] Rapture and Faith then we got to get up
[28:14] there somewhere
[28:17] we got to get there somewhere somehow
[28:19] somewhere we ought to get there
[28:23] and we're now looking at the word
[28:24] acknowledge we see that knowledge is a
[28:27] two this is two uh sides of the story
[28:31] you got a tree of life and you got the
[28:33] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we
[28:34] talked about this morning where is the
[28:36] Tree of Life the tree of life is inside
[28:37] your soul if you're born again today you
[28:40] have the tree of life and you're feeding
[28:42] from that brother Brown said we're
[28:44] feeding down the body word of the son of
[28:46] man which why that was word made flesh
[28:48] he told him to eat my flesh and drink my
[28:50] blood that's exactly what we're doing
[28:51] but we know what we're doing we know
[28:53] we're not eating the physical body and
[28:54] we're not eating drinking the physical
[28:55] flesh as a representation next Sunday
[28:59] we'll be taking communion
[29:01] and um
[29:02] that's what we'll be doing but we'll
[29:04] know in our mind why we're doing it
[29:06] we're taking the wine and we're taking
[29:09] the bread as a symbol and he said do
[29:11] this until I come back amen so we know
[29:14] one thing's for sure we're going to keep
[29:16] doing it till he gets back all right
[29:18] we're going to do what the word says
[29:20] we're going to do what it tells us to do
[29:21] in our communion all right and in Isaiah
[29:24] 53 says by his knowledge so we're not
[29:27] looking at our knowledge as we were
[29:28] talking about this morning our knowledge
[29:29] is over here
[29:31] our knowledge is like way over here
[29:34] and his knowledge is like way over there
[29:36] because he said
[29:38] go aways are not my ways
[29:41] your thoughts are not my thoughts he
[29:43] didn't say you might have one two or
[29:44] three little bit ones he said no my
[29:46] thoughts are not your thoughts my ways
[29:49] are not your ways so we need to wait
[29:51] keep our ways or take his
[29:54] that's what I thought we're going to
[29:56] take his way
[29:57] now look in John 8 verse 31 Jesus said
[30:00] look he said those that believed on him
[30:03] if you continue in my word and that's
[30:06] what we're doing now we're continuing in
[30:09] the word of God it should be a
[30:11] continuous as we were talking about this
[30:12] morning a continuous revelation of the
[30:14] word of God if you continue my word then
[30:17] are you my disciples indeed and you
[30:21] shall know the truth now that word no
[30:23] comes from the word knowledge knowledge
[30:26] is to know all right and you shall know
[30:28] the truth and the truth shall make you
[30:30] free now that was a group of people
[30:31] though that was in the Bible that Jesus
[30:33] said
[30:34] Jesus said ah they'll come to me in that
[30:36] day and say have I not cast out Devils
[30:38] have I not done these Mighty works and
[30:40] we've done it in your name and he said
[30:42] depart from me I never knew you now that
[30:46] word no and new is used in the Jewish
[30:50] language is intimate relationship or
[30:53] where Adam knew Eve in other words
[30:55] making love all right that's what Jesus
[30:57] is telling me he said look you might
[30:59] have known who I was intellectually but
[31:01] you never had an experience with me to
[31:04] become my bride you never were my bride
[31:06] you you I give you a chance to be and
[31:09] you did these Mighty works but you
[31:11] didn't go on down into that throne room
[31:13] and let me in you were just anointed by
[31:15] a spirit let's please let's don't be
[31:17] anointed by that kind of a spirit amen
[31:20] let us continue on and as brother Dale's
[31:23] always said we need to every day say
[31:24] Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost give me
[31:26] the Holy Ghost if I don't have the Holy
[31:27] Ghost please give me the Holy Ghost I
[31:29] want the Holy Ghost Lord you I want him
[31:31] he's not going to get tired of that you
[31:33] know what he's tired of he's tired of
[31:34] the people says well I got it
[31:36] but I ain't got to do everything you say
[31:38] Lord I'll just do us every once in a
[31:39] while I'll get some of this out of uh
[31:41] you know I'll pull the book out every
[31:42] once in a while and I'll listen to tape
[31:44] every once in a while
[31:45] that's not what he wants
[31:48] he wants us to be what's be children be
[31:50] sons of daughters of God start that way
[31:52] start as a child
[31:53] but I speak as a child Paul said but now
[31:55] what I put away those childish things
[31:58] um it'd be kind of it'd be kind of awful
[32:00] for us to go to your house and go to
[32:03] Donny's house and and look in the floor
[32:05] and there's there's
[32:07] Jonas be going
[32:09] but Donnie what are you playing with
[32:10] Legos for
[32:13] bro daddy why you got hot wheel cars out
[32:16] on the
[32:17] ain't nothing wrong with Hot Wheel cars
[32:20] but that but I used to do that but
[32:22] that's been put away
[32:24] that's those childish things to be put
[32:26] away
[32:27] I want those hot wheel cars to be real
[32:28] big cars and I won't have that 57
[32:30] Chevrolet in that all those different
[32:32] things you know that we get now as you
[32:34] get older guess what same way in God we
[32:36] do start by playing
[32:40] you don't know what you're doing we
[32:42] start by playing
[32:44] don't I don't have an idea what's going
[32:46] on but as we get older and get older and
[32:48] get older guess what we start figuring
[32:51] life out just a little bit that's the
[32:53] same way with God if you'll just stay
[32:54] here stay under the fountain listen to
[32:56] the word of God listen to the preachers
[32:59] listen to your elders and listen to
[33:01] brother Bynum on his tape then guess
[33:04] what something good is going to happen
[33:06] it's when we quit doing those things
[33:07] it's when we quit and stop and leave
[33:10] church and nobody don't love me no more
[33:12] nobody don't care about me and and you
[33:14] know brother Danny didn't shake my hand
[33:16] didn't even look at me today
[33:19] sorry
[33:20] it's all right with him he knows all
[33:22] right with him
[33:25] but that's the way we get we get all
[33:26] these feelings involved
[33:28] amen
[33:30] that's why Satan went after Eve and not
[33:33] Adam
[33:35] was the man Adam had the not more
[33:38] intelligence than a woman okay okay
[33:40] sisters y'all should have said amen and
[33:42] clap but
[33:44] it wasn't that he was she was you know
[33:47] less
[33:48] dumb
[33:50] no she had emotion and feelings and
[33:53] Satan knew that he could feel that and
[33:54] he knew that if I can just get to her
[33:56] and get to her emotion I'll turn her
[33:59] away
[34:00] now don't you think he's slick he's
[34:02] slick now doing the same identical thing
[34:04] if I can just get the get get the
[34:06] emotional part to override everything
[34:08] else then I got him that's what he did
[34:10] with the church that's what he did in
[34:11] Isaiah he took them they went to nicia
[34:13] and took a false Doctrine
[34:17] the bride brother rammsted went to
[34:19] nicaea and tried their best to turn the
[34:21] people back but it didn't happen it
[34:23] wasn't time it was time for this Joel 2
[34:26] 25 for the tree to be eaten down the
[34:29] bride tree was eaten down almost to a
[34:31] stump but listen
[34:33] I will restore
[34:36] and that's God not the man I will
[34:39] restore to you the years the Locust eat
[34:42] caterpillar canker worm Pummel were in
[34:45] my great Army which I sent among you and
[34:47] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[34:49] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[34:50] you know today it's The Darkest Day
[34:52] Darkest Hour that ever been but you know
[34:54] we can eat better than anybody ever
[34:56] that's naturally and spiritually
[34:58] we got restaurants everywhere
[35:01] one more time everywhere
[35:04] amen
[35:05] and we can eat and plenty but so do we
[35:08] have the word of God in our access we
[35:10] got it in our hand we got it in our
[35:12] watch now we got it in our car we've got
[35:14] it everywhere we need it we've got
[35:16] access to the word of God and what are
[35:18] we doing about it
[35:21] we shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[35:23] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[35:25] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[35:28] my people
[35:29] shall never be ashamed
[35:31] Isaiah 28 says Whom Shall he teach
[35:33] knowledge me that's a question Whom
[35:36] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[35:38] who's he talking to he's talking to me
[35:39] he might be talking to you but he's
[35:41] talking to me then that are weaned from
[35:43] the milk and drawn from the breast in
[35:45] other words we come to it a stage of
[35:48] where we come into adoption when we come
[35:49] to fullness will we come to where we eat
[35:50] meat instead of eating
[35:53] the carrying of the world
[35:56] and the junk that this world feeds us
[35:58] everybody with me amen you can amen
[36:00] anytime you want to
[36:03] really ain't gonna bother me a bit
[36:05] I want to read something that I got
[36:07] that I had on this one that I had didn't
[36:09] read this morning talking about
[36:11] revelation
[36:13] and I want to read this right here real
[36:14] quick
[36:17] I didn't get to it right here
[36:20] we were talking about Revelation and
[36:22] brother Brown talks about needing
[36:23] Revelation more than anything else in
[36:24] the world
[36:25] watch him continuation in Revelation and
[36:28] Jesus Christ the program said no man
[36:29] knows the things of God save the spirit
[36:31] of God and He To Whom the spirit of God
[36:34] reveals them we need to call on God for
[36:37] revelation
[36:41] more than anything else in the world
[36:45] we have accepted listen to this now he's
[36:47] not finished we have accepted the Bible
[36:49] we know it's true we have accepted the
[36:52] great truths of it absolutely but it
[36:55] still is not real to most people
[36:58] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[37:01] not there
[37:02] I don't want us to be intellectual
[37:04] Giants
[37:06] I want us to be revelated Giants
[37:09] because listen you can quote all you
[37:11] want to
[37:12] but when it's deep down inside and it
[37:14] comes from God Satan has to back up
[37:18] and you know what
[37:20] remember I wrote read your quote several
[37:22] weeks ago
[37:23] Satan is the biggest bluffer there is so
[37:25] if you start blessing him he knows when
[37:27] you're blessing
[37:28] so he just goes but when he knows you're
[37:30] not bluffing when he met Jesus Christ
[37:32] the three times after the Wilderness
[37:34] Journey when after Jesus was in the
[37:37] wilderness in those three times he
[37:38] tempted him he knew he was not talking
[37:40] to a normal person
[37:42] all right why he said it is and all he
[37:44] said was it is written he didn't jump up
[37:46] down and shout and preached a 25 or 30
[37:47] minute sermon
[37:51] he said it's written
[37:54] that you shall not tempt the Lord thy
[37:55] God
[37:57] but look it's still not real to most
[37:59] people because we're
[38:01] not there
[38:05] the second Corinthians 5 21 that we have
[38:08] become the righteousness of God by our
[38:10] Union with Jesus Christ did you get it
[38:13] it says that we are the very
[38:15] righteousness of God himself
[38:19] that's what I want us to get to know
[38:21] this year please you are the
[38:23] righteousness of God through Jesus
[38:26] Christ by being in Christ it says that
[38:28] he Jesus became sin for us it does not
[38:31] say he became sinful but became sin for
[38:34] us that our Union with him we might
[38:37] become the righteousness of God if we
[38:40] accept the fact look and we must
[38:43] that he literally became sin for us by
[38:46] his substitution for us then we must
[38:49] also accept the fact that we are by our
[38:51] Union with him have become the very
[38:53] righteousness of God I want you to read
[38:55] this with me
[38:57] read it with me to reject one is to
[39:01] reject the other to accept the one is to
[39:04] accept the other all right that's your
[39:07] choice today
[39:08] now we know the Bible says that it can't
[39:10] be denied but the revelation of it is
[39:12] missing
[39:14] wow that's a prophet back in 1961 but
[39:17] the revelation of it is missing it is
[39:20] not real to the majority of God's
[39:22] children
[39:24] he didn't say God's
[39:27] mature children he didn't say God's
[39:29] adults he said God's children it is just
[39:33] a good verse in the Bible but we need to
[39:36] have it made alive to us that will take
[39:40] a revelation to make it alive to us for
[39:45] everyone that uses milk is unskillful in
[39:47] the word of righteousness for he is a
[39:49] babe but strong meat belongs to them
[39:51] that are of full age even those look who
[39:53] by reason of use
[39:56] the Bible says to what exercise your
[39:59] faith
[40:01] even those who by reason of use have
[40:03] their senses
[40:06] senses
[40:07] memories and conscious effects and
[40:09] Imagination remember there's only two
[40:10] there's only one or the other in your
[40:12] souls that's Faith or doubt right who
[40:14] have reasons by reason of use have their
[40:16] senses exercised to discern
[40:21] both Good and Evil
[40:23] you saw that was for a prophet no it's
[40:25] for you
[40:26] it was a gift given to an age that he
[40:29] could discern the thoughts and
[40:31] intentions of your heart bring you up in
[40:32] front of a group of people and discern
[40:35] it and be 100 true now that can still
[40:38] happen but not in the magnitude that it
[40:40] happened back then
[40:41] because that was one gift to one
[40:43] generation everybody with me but now I
[40:45] believe that since we have the word of
[40:47] God because brother Brown you watch him
[40:49] and I want to see these people that that
[40:51] want to do away with brother Ratterman
[40:53] think he was wrong I mean he stood there
[40:54] and he said if God be God
[40:58] if I've told you the truth tonight
[41:01] let him come on the scene and vindicate
[41:04] it and he did it every time
[41:06] God didn't have to
[41:08] he'd have to vindicate non-word he
[41:10] didn't have to
[41:11] vindicate somebody that was false
[41:15] but he stood before hundreds of
[41:17] thousands of people
[41:19] and he said tonight if I've told you the
[41:21] truth he said let God come on this
[41:23] platform and you'll see the glory of God
[41:25] and God was there every single time
[41:30] he never had a sermon please bring me
[41:32] one if he says now I've been waiting on
[41:34] him for about five minutes we're gonna
[41:35] wait a few more minutes and see if he
[41:37] comes now I know that there's times that
[41:39] he did wait on God
[41:40] because God's Sovereign he can come
[41:42] whenever he wants to listen we can't
[41:44] override the sovereignty of God whatever
[41:45] what that was something had to get out
[41:47] of the way for him to come but he wasn't
[41:48] because brother Brown was preaching
[41:49] fault Doctrine
[41:52] but he didn't wait 30 minutes and then
[41:54] 30 minutes later he's like
[41:56] well he's not he's not coming tonight he
[41:59] must be somewhere else he's probably
[42:01] over there Oral Roberts or somewhere
[42:02] he's not coming tonight he never said
[42:05] that God has to honor his word take him
[42:07] at his word start speaking to yourself
[42:10] speak to your children speak to your
[42:12] wife everything you need speak to
[42:14] yourself for the new birth
[42:18] who by reason of use have their senses
[42:21] exercised to discern both Good and Evil
[42:25] Jonas
[42:28] yesterday
[42:31] Ewan
[42:32] um Thomas
[42:33] where did y'all go
[42:36] went to Perry George why
[42:39] so he can shoot archery first time
[42:41] you've ever picked up a bow right
[42:44] really
[42:46] oh you practiced
[42:48] oh man
[42:50] how many times you practice
[42:53] yeah I know if it was Guns going off
[42:54] we'd done arrested you
[42:57] you go over to this house it looks like
[42:59] Custer's Last Stand
[43:01] but it's usually in the bullseye same
[43:04] way with with Thomas they shot well why
[43:06] have they practiced
[43:09] well I don't know one thing there was
[43:10] not one person down there your dad said
[43:12] there's about 800 people down there
[43:14] shooting archery
[43:15] not one of them walked up and said I
[43:18] ain't never done this before hand me a
[43:19] bow
[43:21] I wouldn't be in the same room with them
[43:22] because you know what they'd be doing
[43:25] why they were unskillful in what they
[43:28] were sent to do
[43:29] you and I cannot be unskillful in what
[43:32] God sent us to do but we got to practice
[43:34] and practice and practice
[43:37] practice what Jonas form practice your
[43:40] form every time your muscles have to be
[43:44] toned to do that job because it's a
[43:47] stick in the string and it's hard to
[43:48] shoot them things I promise you'd done
[43:50] it before
[43:51] but when you get everything down right
[43:53] and you lock that baby in you locked in
[43:56] back muscles and you don't do this
[43:59] your training will put that Arrow right
[44:02] where it's at same thing with me and you
[44:03] our problem is is we're unskillful
[44:07] I'm me okay I'm sorry I'm gonna preach
[44:10] to me today I'm unskillful because
[44:12] there's things that I want done in my
[44:13] life and things that I won't done not me
[44:16] personally but I want God to do in my
[44:18] life that's not happening yet
[44:21] why I haven't practiced enough
[44:24] to discern both good and evil the word
[44:27] discern means to separate make a
[44:29] distinction discriminate to prefer and
[44:32] remember we're in this age of of
[44:35] discrimination and all this stuff
[44:37] brother Brown told us that God was
[44:40] he did discriminate
[44:43] he said
[44:45] these are my kids these are not he was a
[44:48] segregationist he separated why he
[44:51] discerned brother Brown's discernment
[44:52] was to what it was to separate the good
[44:55] from the bad the false from the true
[44:57] remember there was people that came up
[44:59] in his early Ministry and gave him those
[45:01] cards and it was wrong
[45:03] and they were trying to do that to trick
[45:05] him well what brother rhyme tell him he
[45:07] said look there's nothing wrong with you
[45:08] this is not but now
[45:10] since you've done this to the Holy Ghost
[45:12] now you have those things that are on
[45:15] that card
[45:16] you don't play with God
[45:18] no
[45:20] he don't play with that gift either
[45:23] so to discern it so that discernment is
[45:25] for me and you both it's to separate
[45:27] make a distinction we got to know what's
[45:29] right and what's wrong we got to know
[45:30] whether we listen to false Doctrine or
[45:32] we listen to True Doctrine and to do
[45:34] what to take that and use it in our
[45:37] archery tournament or you use it in our
[45:40] track of life or the things that we do
[45:42] and that we do for God and and like
[45:45] brother Bob and brother Louise brother
[45:47] Bob has never been over to another
[45:49] country before I don't know if you've
[45:50] ever been out two or three states before
[45:52] every time you see the pictures of him
[45:54] he's like his white eye like a deer in a
[45:55] headline
[45:56] he's having the time but he's saying
[45:59] things he probably has never seen before
[46:01] amen but now Luis
[46:04] he's been there
[46:05] he's been there two or three times he's
[46:07] you're part of the culture you know and
[46:09] he's he's like just as comfortable he
[46:10] can be and Bob's like
[46:13] why
[46:16] he doesn't have discernment because he
[46:18] doesn't know what he's looking at yet
[46:19] that's not to say anything against Bob
[46:21] it's just his first time
[46:22] but when he goes back again he's going
[46:24] to be more calm you know I've been to
[46:26] Jamaica 11 times and it doesn't bother
[46:28] me one bit to go get on a plane go to
[46:29] Jamaican I could probably Drive I'd have
[46:31] to remember to drive on the other side
[46:33] of the road but I went wasn't bother me
[46:36] because I pretty much know the place why
[46:37] I've been there
[46:39] so I can separate the good from the bad
[46:42] I can go to the right places well that's
[46:45] the way God is with the word he tells
[46:47] you what to do and we're supposed to do
[46:48] that we're not supposed to well you know
[46:52] let's just live close enough to the
[46:53] world where they can't tell the
[46:54] difference no you need to live so far
[46:56] away from the world so they definitely
[46:57] can tell the difference amen so that's
[47:00] discernment and what is their
[47:02] discernment oh y'all just get beat down
[47:04] you just have to do this I am so sorry
[47:07] and I'm going to tell you something to
[47:09] be really honest sisters with long hair
[47:11] like that like Jim's got
[47:13] God bless you
[47:18] God bless you
[47:20] because I'm telling you if fires is
[47:23] wrong we gonna get it cut
[47:27] yeah I mean if we got two or three you
[47:29] know every time June's got them Flyers
[47:31] you know got them to stick out way out
[47:33] like this and you can't ever get back to
[47:34] the back
[47:36] right but see we don't have to do that
[47:39] we just go in there and go man that's
[47:40] been there a while you know start
[47:41] cutting it off but your sisters don't do
[47:43] that to fill the glory of the Lord not
[47:45] because it makes you look good battery
[47:46] indifferent you do it for the glory of
[47:48] the Lord right
[47:49] but it is a sacrifice
[47:52] God bless you for that I appreciate you
[47:54] washing your hair you have to have to
[47:56] wash all that all that hair bless your
[47:58] heart I sent her up the Genies up to our
[48:01] girl at the at the beauty shop and she
[48:02] washed her hair for her because I don't
[48:04] know if I could do that or not that's
[48:06] just a lot to have to wash that's a lot
[48:08] of hair but you know what
[48:10] that's your example
[48:12] that's your example to the world you
[48:14] can't preach
[48:16] come on but you can show the world that
[48:19] it can be done what the Bible says
[48:22] and you know what it not be done
[48:24] begrudgingly but be doing it for the
[48:26] glory of God and doing it because you
[48:29] you don't feel you have to everybody
[48:31] thinks you know what well y'all are so
[48:32] depressed and so suppressed and all that
[48:34] we're the most free people on the face
[48:37] of the Earth we do it because we want to
[48:39] not because we have to
[48:42] mine
[48:44] and I pray to you that your love may
[48:46] abound yet more and more in what
[48:48] knowledge and in all judgment we have
[48:51] been given this knowledge right down
[48:53] here at the bottom of the pyramid to
[48:55] judge because I'll promise you when you
[48:57] get Temperance and patience you're gonna
[48:59] have to know what you're doing
[49:01] somebody say Amen because that's going
[49:03] to be the rough one for all of us
[49:05] but now there's a group that has a form
[49:07] of godliness I'll get back to my other
[49:09] sermon in a minute I didn't finish this
[49:11] this morning some have a form of
[49:13] godliness but deny the power thereof he
[49:16] said from such turn away in other words
[49:18] go in another Direction
[49:20] for this sort of they which creep into
[49:22] houses and Lead captive silly churches
[49:26] women are churches in the Bible
[49:29] Laden with sins LED away with many lusts
[49:33] ever learning and never able to come to
[49:36] the knowledge of the truth God don't
[49:38] ever let me get in that place
[49:39] don't ever let me get into that spot
[49:42] Hebrews 10 verse 23 let us hold fast the
[49:45] profession of our faith look without
[49:47] wavering
[49:49] so why if the storms of life hit you
[49:51] right between the eyes if you're a child
[49:53] of God it's got to be for your help
[49:56] God's not going to put something on you
[49:59] that you can't handle you just don't
[50:01] know whether you can handle yet or not
[50:04] and let us consider one another
[50:06] to provoke under love and good words not
[50:09] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[50:11] who put that in there
[50:13] thank you
[50:16] not forsake you the Assembly of
[50:18] ourselves together as a manner of some
[50:20] is but exhorting one another and so much
[50:22] more as we see the day approaching for
[50:25] if we sin willfully look at that
[50:27] scripture right after that if we sin
[50:30] willfully after that we've received the
[50:32] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[50:35] no more sacrifice for that sin
[50:38] and I'm not going to read you the rest
[50:39] of it because it's pretty horrible
[50:41] so let's get out of that one let's go up
[50:43] here to get back on my sermon here
[50:46] everybody all right say Amen
[50:51] so here we go I love that little thing
[50:52] that says welcome back knowledge
[50:55] second Peter 1 verse 5 beside this
[50:57] giving all diligence add to your faith
[50:59] virtue into virtue knowledge knowledge
[51:01] is no cease which is science science is
[51:04] good if it's right listen God's the
[51:06] greatest scientist there ever was
[51:09] the greatest he's the most perfect
[51:11] scientist he can answer every question
[51:13] there's not a uh when you say that Aaron
[51:16] when you can't come to it's like you
[51:18] can't have a whole number it's like
[51:19] 0.3333 and it continues isn't there a
[51:22] there's a there's a there's a theory or
[51:24] some kind of a something that I can't
[51:27] remember been a long time ago but it
[51:28] never comes to a straight number it just
[51:30] keeps going like threes and twos and
[51:32] ones and you can't ever get the exact
[51:34] definite number well in God that'll
[51:36] happen
[51:37] wait
[51:39] yes thank you and it just keeps going on
[51:42] and on and on and on why there's no end
[51:44] to it we haven't figured it out yet God
[51:47] doesn't do that
[51:48] God's yeses are yes and there's no's or
[51:51] no
[51:52] knowledge signifies in general
[51:54] intelligence understanding the general
[51:56] knowledge of Christian religion the
[51:57] deeper more perfect and enlarged
[51:59] knowledge of this religion that's what I
[52:02] want
[52:04] I want God to make us deeper in the word
[52:06] of God because you know why it make your
[52:08] life a whole lot better
[52:10] it may mind in your life a whole lot
[52:12] better if we dig deeper and get the
[52:14] knowledge of God not the knowledge of
[52:15] the world
[52:17] such as belongs to the more advanced
[52:19] especially of things lawful and unlawful
[52:22] for Christians see that's coming from
[52:24] this is coming from from the um from the
[52:27] Greek
[52:28] now why does the denominations not see
[52:31] that why does the people that are
[52:32] tricked into believing these doctrines
[52:34] that are not true because look it says
[52:36] especially if those things lawful and
[52:37] unlawful for a Christian it's unlawful
[52:40] for you to cut your hair sisters
[52:42] it's not just a uh well maybe no it's in
[52:45] the Bible
[52:49] such as belongs to the more advanced
[52:51] especially if things lawful and unlawful
[52:53] Christian moral wisdom such as in seeing
[52:56] and right as seen in right living
[52:59] now see
[53:00] we shouldn't have to teach that
[53:07] we shouldn't have to teach right living
[53:09] but we do for the babies
[53:12] you have to remind the baby a hundred
[53:15] times you ought not have to remind an
[53:17] adult a hundred times
[53:20] everybody with me so make sure you sign
[53:22] up that sheet down there before
[53:24] Wednesday
[53:25] make my mama mad Genesis 2 verse 9.
[53:30] listen we're all the same old same
[53:33] I'm the same way
[53:34] amen my wife's in
[53:37] that's all right
[53:42] out of the ground made the Lord to grow
[53:44] every tree
[53:45] and what are we feeding off let's get
[53:47] back on our subject the Tree of Life
[53:50] in the midst of your garden is what
[53:53] we're eating off of
[53:54] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[53:55] Evil
[53:57] is that next realm of memory region
[54:00] conscious affection that we were looking
[54:01] at this morning because look see you can
[54:03] have a knowledge of Good and Evil listen
[54:05] to me you can have a knowledge of Good
[54:06] and Evil in your spirit
[54:09] you can't your soul
[54:12] it's either good or evil
[54:15] but you can have a knowledge of Good and
[54:17] Evil in your memory reason conscious
[54:20] affection imagination because Satan
[54:21] plays in that realm and God is in that
[54:23] realm everybody with me on that
[54:26] the knowledge
[54:28] of Good and Evil
[54:30] you wrote in on that today
[54:34] you wrote in on the tree of knowledge of
[54:36] Good and Evil today because some people
[54:38] literally wrote in and their horse on
[54:40] their horse several hundred years ago
[54:42] you know I hadn't been long
[54:44] it had been about a hundred and
[54:46] something years since the motor was
[54:48] created and then it was just a little
[54:50] bit it will get you 20 miles an hour
[54:53] maybe something like that but look at it
[54:55] now we've come to where uh we got
[54:59] well airplanes run six seven hundred
[55:01] miles an hour we broke sound barrier and
[55:03] just keep on going 1500 miles an hour
[55:04] two thousand well guess what that's the
[55:06] way it should be in the word of God
[55:15] then remember he sent us out sent him
[55:17] out of the garden listen we went out
[55:18] without him and Eve
[55:20] we stay in the garden
[55:22] we went out with Adam and Eve because we
[55:24] can't get back in the garden yet we're
[55:25] getting we're heading back to the Garden
[55:27] but we came out with Adam and Eve
[55:29] brother Brown said that was our that was
[55:31] our father mother
[55:34] we were born between Satan and Eve
[55:37] well you can get quiet on me it's okay
[55:40] I know it's afternoon I know we ate
[55:42] something and it's a little bit sweaty
[55:44] but
[55:47] I'm going to anyway doesn't matter if
[55:49] you sit there and look at stare at me
[55:50] like I'm crazy
[55:51] I know I'm crazy so don't stare at me
[55:53] like that you're wasting your time and
[55:54] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[55:57] every tree of the garden they may you
[55:59] may freely eat but of the tree of
[56:00] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[56:02] not eat for in the day
[56:04] you eat that tree you're going to surely
[56:07] die and Eve did
[56:09] and then Adam did and then we died
[56:12] and that part we're still eating off of
[56:14] to this day
[56:16] but you know what's going to happen
[56:18] when we talk about you go to the
[56:20] invisible Union brother Brown says the
[56:22] second Eve talking about what then you
[56:24] take Christ to mystery God revealed that
[56:26] that threefold purpose of Christ the
[56:28] mystery what
[56:30] all things in Christ all things in the
[56:32] church take us back to the Garden of
[56:33] Eden but we got to have all things in
[56:35] Christ and then hurt us first before he
[56:37] takes us back to the Garden of Eden he
[56:39] is going to take us back to the Garden
[56:40] of Eden whether we want whether the
[56:43] world says not ain't never going to be
[56:44] Eden yes there will be in Eden yes
[56:48] there'll be a time even in a millennium
[56:49] there's going to be a time that me and
[56:51] you're not going to have to worry about
[56:52] a car worry about a credit card worry
[56:54] about a bill
[56:55] somebody's saying man good grief I don't
[56:57] want to make you happy
[56:59] travel like I thought
[57:02] eat what we want to not we have to what
[57:04] we have to
[57:07] well maybe you'll get a revelation one
[57:08] of these things
[57:12] but remember the church left their first
[57:14] love that's why that's why we're having
[57:16] to start down here again
[57:20] because we left our first look they had
[57:22] these virtues
[57:24] but Joe they had them working in the
[57:26] first church second Church in a little
[57:27] bit in the Third Church what eat it down
[57:29] man's ideas eat that thing down to hair
[57:32] again
[57:33] that's why he had to restore our restore
[57:35] saith the Lord because look first three
[57:38] Church ages brother rap said they had
[57:39] the pure word of God
[57:41] no denominations sure the ideas were
[57:43] coming in because he said he said
[57:45] there's nicolaitanism it's coming in
[57:47] right now
[57:49] but it was in the baby form
[57:52] baby form
[57:54] remember from where you've fallen and we
[57:56] did we we had a prophet to tell us
[58:00] where we left
[58:02] where the church got off
[58:04] and where to come back to
[58:06] we know that now
[58:08] the Baptists don't know that they think
[58:10] they're still on the right track
[58:11] methodists were on the right track
[58:13] someone might be on their right track
[58:17] but I tell you before like I said again
[58:19] there's Brides brides churches Brides
[58:21] but there's going to come one there's
[58:23] one church one bride that's going to be
[58:26] without spot or wrinkle and we're going
[58:28] to take a body change
[58:30] I just contend it's us
[58:34] remember where you fall repent do the
[58:37] first words
[58:39] or else I'll come and take your
[58:41] Candlestick out of its place no I'm
[58:44] going to take your fire out because
[58:45] you're not using it I'm gonna take your
[58:47] light out because you're not using it
[58:49] except I'll reprint but this thou has
[58:52] that thou hatest of these are the
[58:53] Nicolaitans which also hate watches
[58:55] nicolaitanism what Conquering the laity
[59:00] if Satan can get you guys
[59:04] either have to near let him hear what
[59:06] the spirit says to the church and him
[59:07] and overcometh well I give to either the
[59:09] tree of life now we're back eating a
[59:10] tree of life if you're born again today
[59:12] you are eating off the tree of life
[59:15] all right which is in the midst of the
[59:17] paradise of God and right here is the
[59:19] paradise of God
[59:20] does not mind He knows where the new
[59:23] city is going to be he knows what it's
[59:26] going to look like he knows how square
[59:28] miles he didn't he had brother Branham
[59:30] got that by Revelation but God didn't
[59:32] get it by Revelation he knew it was
[59:33] going to be 1500 Miles Square and only
[59:35] the bride was going to live there but we
[59:37] didn't know that they know World nobody
[59:39] out there in the world knows that we're
[59:41] going to live in a 1500 square mile city
[59:43] just to bride
[59:45] just a bride and 144 000.
[59:49] but we do know that we know God's given
[59:51] us a place but you know what the
[59:52] paradise of God's inside of you
[59:55] by the new birth
[59:56] you have a peace and a part of that City
[59:58] inside you today and that's that desire
[1:00:00] you're going to see it come down out of
[1:00:02] Heaven you did when you got born again
[1:00:03] but remember we're going to go over in
[1:00:06] another dimension God's going to destroy
[1:00:07] this thing and he's going to bring that
[1:00:09] city that was built by your desire
[1:00:13] all right
[1:00:18] what does knowledge mean the fact or
[1:00:19] condition of knowing something with
[1:00:21] familiarity I got it right gain through
[1:00:24] experience or Association acquainted
[1:00:26] acquaintance with our understanding of a
[1:00:29] science art or a technique the fact of
[1:00:31] condition of being aware of something
[1:00:33] listen we can't go through this world
[1:00:36] and not be aware if you've come under
[1:00:38] this message of the hour you ought to
[1:00:40] know that and be aware that you are
[1:00:42] special people that you are the chosen
[1:00:49] some choose to be the chosen Frozen but
[1:00:51] that's okay one day God's going to put a
[1:00:54] fire under you and
[1:00:57] you'll find out there's nothing in this
[1:00:58] world that you need
[1:01:00] besides God
[1:01:04] circumstance or condition of
[1:01:05] apprehending Truth
[1:01:08] what do you do what does apprehend mean
[1:01:10] when somebody steals something or you
[1:01:12] you chasing some robbers what do you do
[1:01:14] when you you catch them you apprehend
[1:01:16] them you go catch them and you bring
[1:01:18] them back and that's what we're doing
[1:01:19] with these
[1:01:21] these look folks this has all been lost
[1:01:25] the virtues have been lost down Through
[1:01:27] the Ages they've just been scattered
[1:01:28] everywhere thank God it took a master
[1:01:30] builder it took the rubble
[1:01:34] it was removable to bring it back
[1:01:37] put it back together build it back up do
[1:01:41] a little prophet of Malachi 4. he even
[1:01:44] told him how to draw this drawing
[1:01:46] nobody ever put the pyramid with the
[1:01:48] with the Statue of perfect man
[1:01:51] right is that one
[1:01:53] and that's good enough for me because
[1:01:54] you know what it fits
[1:01:56] it fits
[1:01:59] if you continue my words then you are my
[1:02:01] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[1:02:03] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:02:05] now listen
[1:02:07] we can't know the truth and it behind us
[1:02:11] you can't
[1:02:13] it's not the right truth
[1:02:15] if you got something that's binding you
[1:02:17] it's not the truth
[1:02:19] because the truth is going to set you
[1:02:21] free
[1:02:21] that Jubilee year when they got to that
[1:02:24] place and they realized it was the 50th
[1:02:26] year and they realized I don't care how
[1:02:29] much debt I incurred I don't care how
[1:02:31] much I I my house needs this and the
[1:02:34] gutters and shutters and all that stuff
[1:02:36] I'm going free
[1:02:38] God give me a place over there not here
[1:02:42] come on people God give us a place over
[1:02:45] there not here we know it's going to be
[1:02:46] here but we got to go over here and let
[1:02:48] him clean this off then we're going to
[1:02:49] come back
[1:02:50] man
[1:02:52] that word know is to perceive understand
[1:02:56] get a knowledge
[1:02:58] of perceive or feel
[1:03:01] understand perceive have a knowledge of
[1:03:03] to understand look it's a Jewish idiom
[1:03:05] for sexual intercourse between a man and
[1:03:07] a woman Adam knew his wife Eve all right
[1:03:10] look at this to become with acquainted
[1:03:13] with to know to the Greeks it's meant to
[1:03:15] know facts but these facts May or not
[1:03:18] affect one's conduct
[1:03:20] to the Jews true knowledge always
[1:03:23] manifested itself in one's conduct
[1:03:28] you know what that is
[1:03:30] it always manifests itself in one's
[1:03:34] conduct
[1:03:35] if you got a problem with your temper
[1:03:36] I'll promise you God is going to make
[1:03:39] sure you know whether you got left left
[1:03:41] you or not I used to say no that's the
[1:03:43] devil now that's good if you're a child
[1:03:45] of God it's God guiding this because
[1:03:48] what brother Brown Say
[1:03:49] he said he turned the devil loose on you
[1:03:52] if you consider my servant job job was a
[1:03:55] wonderful guy he was just having a party
[1:03:56] he was great
[1:03:59] devil didn't even notice him
[1:04:02] lord said
[1:04:05] if you consider this guy right here
[1:04:09] we've been Satan me walking up down the
[1:04:10] Earth in other words there was millions
[1:04:11] of people on the Earth and he just he
[1:04:13] just tormenting every one of them and
[1:04:14] here's job over here somewhere in the
[1:04:16] corner and nobody's bothered him
[1:04:17] nobody's seen him he's got all the
[1:04:19] cattle he can he can feed and he's got
[1:04:21] all the kids and he's got houses and
[1:04:23] he's got property and he's got
[1:04:25] everything and he said hey devil if you
[1:04:27] have you checked this guy out yet
[1:04:31] God did that
[1:04:33] you know why because he knew what job
[1:04:35] would do job didn't know what job would
[1:04:37] do you
[1:04:39] got new and knows what you'll do but you
[1:04:41] don't know
[1:04:42] and see to me that's a revelation
[1:04:44] because it'll it'll help me understand
[1:04:46] where I'm at
[1:04:48] our trials our test is like I said it's
[1:04:52] for a testimony
[1:04:53] but these facts are may may or may not
[1:04:56] affect one's conduct to the Jews true
[1:04:59] knowledge always manifested itself in
[1:05:01] one's conduct one did not know something
[1:05:04] until that fact had a particular
[1:05:07] outworking in his life well that just
[1:05:09] sounds exactly what these virtues are is
[1:05:12] an outworking in your life and sometimes
[1:05:14] you don't know you got it until you go
[1:05:17] to a test and then you figure out yes I
[1:05:19] do or no I don't all right
[1:05:22] Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy as a man
[1:05:24] that findeth wisdom and the man that
[1:05:26] giveth understanding for the merchandise
[1:05:29] of it is better than the merchandise of
[1:05:32] silver and gold
[1:05:33] she see it all that all turns into a she
[1:05:36] now she is more precious than rubies and
[1:05:39] all the things that can't desire are not
[1:05:42] to be compared
[1:05:43] unto her Length of days is in her right
[1:05:46] hand and then her left hand riches an
[1:05:48] honor her ways are ways of pleasantness
[1:05:50] and all her paths are peace she is a
[1:05:53] tree of life
[1:05:55] to them that lay hold upon her and happy
[1:05:57] is everyone that retaineth her
[1:06:01] you know what people ought to be happy
[1:06:03] to be around you
[1:06:06] that's right people ought to be happy to
[1:06:07] be around you
[1:06:12] sit there and think about that for about
[1:06:13] 10 seconds
[1:06:15] and figure out if that's what's
[1:06:16] happening in your life or people can't
[1:06:18] stand to be around you want to do
[1:06:21] and this I pray that your love may
[1:06:22] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:06:24] and in all judgment
[1:06:27] you say judgment yes that knowledge
[1:06:30] right there
[1:06:31] watch this first Corinthians dare any of
[1:06:34] you having a matter against another go
[1:06:36] to law before the unjust
[1:06:38] and not before the Saints
[1:06:41] dare any of you Paul said Paul's in
[1:06:44] corinths all right we got all these
[1:06:46] Corinthians that are babies and they're
[1:06:48] some of them are still out of worship
[1:06:50] person some of them still partying some
[1:06:52] of them still drink at the Lord's table
[1:06:53] and some of them are just newborn babes
[1:06:55] and Paul's gotta treat them like babies
[1:06:57] he said why y'all take each other to
[1:07:00] court
[1:07:04] to go to law before the unjust and not
[1:07:06] before the Saints do you not know that
[1:07:08] the Saints shall judge the world
[1:07:12] and if the world shall be judged by you
[1:07:14] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:07:17] matters
[1:07:19] no ye not that we shall judge angels
[1:07:24] world now angels
[1:07:27] they were created before you got here
[1:07:30] we're still going to judge them
[1:07:33] no you're not that we shall judge Angels
[1:07:35] how much more things that pertain to
[1:07:38] this life
[1:07:39] if then you have judgments of things
[1:07:41] pertaining to this life set them to
[1:07:43] judge who are least esteemed in the
[1:07:45] church you know what Paul's saying he
[1:07:47] said don't take him to the smart guy
[1:07:50] take him to the ones who leads to steam
[1:07:52] because if he's got the Holy Ghost he
[1:07:54] does have some discernment
[1:07:57] now the problem is and and I want to
[1:07:59] explain something real quick because
[1:08:01] um
[1:08:01] don't let people run over you in life
[1:08:04] this is talking about a brother me and
[1:08:07] Donnie
[1:08:08] taking each other to court you should
[1:08:10] not do that
[1:08:12] number one you save a lot on all your
[1:08:14] Thief
[1:08:15] yeah say Amen again
[1:08:17] yeah
[1:08:18] but we should be able to bring it here
[1:08:20] and judge it right here
[1:08:22] now not judge among everybody there's
[1:08:24] some private things but get the Saints
[1:08:25] to get the the elders together and the
[1:08:27] pastor and the sister pastor and the
[1:08:29] deacons and elders and we're going to
[1:08:31] sit down and talk this thing out but now
[1:08:33] if Donnie was in in business with an
[1:08:35] unbeliever
[1:08:37] you can't do nothing about the
[1:08:38] unbeliever you be the Christian
[1:08:43] but he's unjust you see where it says
[1:08:45] right here
[1:08:49] right here
[1:08:52] there you interview having a matter
[1:08:53] against another go to law before the
[1:08:55] unjust and not before the Saints and
[1:08:58] others why are you taking it to somebody
[1:09:00] that's unjust not a Christian and why
[1:09:02] are you letting them jump make you make
[1:09:04] your judgment
[1:09:05] No it should be done here
[1:09:08] that would be a brother and a brother
[1:09:10] together
[1:09:11] if you have a problem it needs to be
[1:09:13] handled here
[1:09:14] now if it's out in the world you can't
[1:09:16] do what they they don't even think like
[1:09:17] we do
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] they don't
[1:09:22] we've handled them before
[1:09:23] they want to take you to court for
[1:09:25] everything
[1:09:27] we should be able to judge it right here
[1:09:30] well get quiet if you want to it's okay
[1:09:34] thirdly add knowledge knowledge now that
[1:09:36] don't mean worldly knowledge because
[1:09:37] that's foolishness to God but knowledge
[1:09:40] to judge just what right from wrong
[1:09:42] how do you judge it then if you've got
[1:09:44] Christian knowledge with your virtue and
[1:09:46] Faith you judge whether the word is
[1:09:48] right or wrong
[1:09:50] and if you can lay us out all your
[1:09:52] Creeds and all your unbelief everything
[1:09:54] you claim you have done
[1:09:58] then you have knowledge to believe that
[1:10:00] God cannot lie
[1:10:02] let every man's word be alive but mine
[1:10:04] be true now you're getting knowledge
[1:10:07] that Supreme knowledge
[1:10:09] you don't have to have four degrees in
[1:10:11] some college or something like that to
[1:10:12] have it because all these virtues are
[1:10:14] given to you by God to place upon the
[1:10:17] foundation of your faith that you might
[1:10:19] come to the full stature of a real
[1:10:21] living man of God
[1:10:23] yes sir but
[1:10:25] when you can see that the scripture is
[1:10:27] not contradictory that you can say that
[1:10:29] and can see that by the revelation of
[1:10:32] God the whole word word is wrote in
[1:10:35] Mysteries somebody asked the other day
[1:10:37] we were talking about something why
[1:10:39] didn't Moses he wrote Genesis he
[1:10:42] actually saw what happened between Adam
[1:10:44] and Eve and he wrote fruit
[1:10:47] trees and fruit
[1:10:51] to hide it
[1:10:53] to hide it from us to make it a mystery
[1:10:56] to the unlearned
[1:10:59] remember God wants to tell us his
[1:11:01] Secrets not the world
[1:11:03] because if they become like us in
[1:11:05] becoming the family of God they'll
[1:11:07] understand it just like we do
[1:11:08] anybody with me why did Moses do that
[1:11:11] Moses saw what happened
[1:11:13] he called it fruit don't eat of that
[1:11:15] either this they did this they did that
[1:11:17] he watched the whole thing he didn't
[1:11:19] just write it down by you know God just
[1:11:21] wrote letters up in the sky now I
[1:11:23] believe he saw I believe he saw the
[1:11:24] whole soon as a creation and he just
[1:11:26] started writing what the creation was
[1:11:28] looking like through a television
[1:11:30] that's just the way I see it
[1:11:35] but folks man didn't see it that way
[1:11:38] they think Eve ate an apple that caused
[1:11:40] all these problems that we have
[1:11:42] but it was hidden but you can take then
[1:11:45] you take the whole Bible
[1:11:46] the Bible talks about being the fruit of
[1:11:48] your mother's womb and about being the
[1:11:50] fruit of your mother and about being
[1:11:52] this and being a fruit and being being
[1:11:53] all this and eating of this and eating
[1:11:55] of that if you put all that together you
[1:11:57] know exactly what happened in the garden
[1:11:59] then when you get and say punctuate
[1:12:02] every word of God with an amen then add
[1:12:05] that to your faith
[1:12:07] then the statue of perfect man I read
[1:12:09] you this morning the prayer was Build Me
[1:12:11] Up Lord into this let Christ be my head
[1:12:13] that works through me on my Foundation
[1:12:16] my faith is in him that virtue and all
[1:12:17] this temporations godliness brotherly
[1:12:19] kindness working Me O Lord is my prayer
[1:12:21] I don't care live or die I think or
[1:12:23] drown domination no denominations friend
[1:12:26] or no friend can we say that
[1:12:29] can we say that
[1:12:31] word working me whether I don't care who
[1:12:34] the world's gonna call us crazy anyway
[1:12:36] because we don't even think the way they
[1:12:39] think
[1:12:41] let that work in me let Christ's virtue
[1:12:43] his knowledge flow out that not be able
[1:12:46] to teach those let's continue on the 70
[1:12:49] weeks so Daniel Brothers talks about a
[1:12:51] spirit coming in the church there's a
[1:12:53] spirit of wisdom comes into the church
[1:12:55] to make known to the church by the
[1:12:57] revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing
[1:12:59] the church in and revealing what day
[1:13:01] we're living in just the same as Gabriel
[1:13:03] come to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:13:05] the church in the last days to reveal
[1:13:08] these great deep secret things
[1:13:12] do you understand now
[1:13:15] oh that's too deep for me you haven't
[1:13:17] studied enough
[1:13:18] you haven't listened to enough tapes you
[1:13:21] haven't read enough books you haven't
[1:13:23] listened to enough sermons because
[1:13:25] somewhere in that if you're a child of
[1:13:27] God he's obligated to put that there
[1:13:29] in front of you for you to make a choice
[1:13:31] with he's obligated he asked he wants to
[1:13:36] not want to as the Bible says you you
[1:13:39] your son starts crying for bread and
[1:13:41] he's hungry and he can't eat you give
[1:13:42] him a rock
[1:13:44] all right
[1:13:45] he's hungry and you give him a scorpion
[1:13:48] that's not our God
[1:13:50] he gives us the best we got the best
[1:13:52] preachers the best deacons the best
[1:13:54] everything we got is the best
[1:14:01] there shall come forth a rod out of the
[1:14:04] stem of Jesse who's you talking about
[1:14:06] Jesus Christ and a branch shall grow out
[1:14:08] of his roots and the spirit of the Lord
[1:14:10] shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom
[1:14:12] and understanding the spirit of what
[1:14:14] counsel and might the spirit of
[1:14:16] knowledge and of the fear of the Lord
[1:14:18] every bit of that is in Jesus Christ now
[1:14:21] everybody that's been transferred into
[1:14:23] me and you
[1:14:24] every bit of that
[1:14:27] Ephesians 1 17 says that the god of our
[1:14:29] Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory
[1:14:31] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:14:33] and Revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:14:36] the eyes of your understanding be
[1:14:38] enlightened that you may know
[1:14:42] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:14:43] the riches of the glory of his
[1:14:45] inheritance
[1:14:46] in the Saints
[1:14:49] Hebrews 5 13 we read a few minutes ago
[1:14:51] we'll read it again everyone that uses
[1:14:53] milk is unskillful now it doesn't say if
[1:14:55] you use milk you were wrong
[1:14:58] and that you denied the word no it just
[1:15:00] says you were unskillful
[1:15:02] in handling the word of God
[1:15:05] for he is a babe but strong me belonged
[1:15:08] to them that are a full age even those
[1:15:10] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:15:12] exercised to discern both good and even
[1:15:15] we read what discern means to separate
[1:15:17] make a distinction discriminate to
[1:15:19] prefer
[1:15:20] so I said about brother Brown I'm
[1:15:22] standing there night after night he's
[1:15:24] sitting there and so vivid he'd tell you
[1:15:26] a house number he'd tell you they got
[1:15:27] bushes in front of your house he said
[1:15:29] your your house number's on your door
[1:15:31] now why did he just say your house
[1:15:33] numbers
[1:15:34] 214. he said it's on your door and your
[1:15:37] door is green
[1:15:38] and you live on so-and-so Street
[1:15:40] and you had you saw a doctor yesterday
[1:15:42] and he owned a blue coat why'd he say
[1:15:44] that he wanted to make sure
[1:15:47] God wanted to make sure that we knew
[1:15:50] that that man was not a hoax that he was
[1:15:53] literally seeing what was going on and
[1:15:56] listen if you see what's going on you're
[1:15:58] an eyewitness
[1:16:02] Timothy says having a form of godliness
[1:16:05] but denying the power thereof
[1:16:07] from such turn away for this sort of lay
[1:16:10] which creep into houses Elite captive
[1:16:12] silly women or silly churches Laden with
[1:16:15] sins LED away with many of us
[1:16:18] ever learning
[1:16:19] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:16:21] of the truth they're learning over here
[1:16:23] but they never come to the knowledge of
[1:16:25] the truth
[1:16:26] you know why because
[1:16:28] most don't want the truth
[1:16:34] the truth hurts
[1:16:36] the truth's hard to handle
[1:16:40] if it was really easy thereby would live
[1:16:42] this Bible and it wouldn't have no
[1:16:43] problems at all every person would live
[1:16:45] this right here and it'd be no problem
[1:16:46] at all it ain't easy it's hard
[1:16:49] you know why it's hard because you fight
[1:16:51] you
[1:16:52] you don't fight me you don't fight
[1:16:54] Donnie
[1:16:55] you fight you
[1:16:57] Hebrews 10 verse 23 let us hold fast the
[1:16:59] profession of our faith look without
[1:17:01] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:17:03] promised and let us consider one another
[1:17:05] to provoke unto love and good words not
[1:17:07] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:17:09] together who put that in there again as
[1:17:11] a matter of some but exhorting one
[1:17:13] another look
[1:17:14] exhorting one another
[1:17:17] and so much more as you see the day
[1:17:19] approaching for if we sin willfully if
[1:17:21] we do this
[1:17:23] we do this willfully now folks there's
[1:17:25] no sacrifice
[1:17:27] for that
[1:17:29] there's the words that we're going to
[1:17:31] stop we'll stop right here musicians
[1:17:33] come on
[1:17:35] the word knowledge the word wisdom
[1:17:36] Spirit of wisdom and to discern all that
[1:17:39] isn't what we just spoke about now we're
[1:17:42] going to talk about Wednesday night
[1:17:43] we're going to talk about the wise and
[1:17:45] the unwise virgin
[1:17:47] and we'll talk about
[1:17:49] being known
[1:17:52] and a little bit more about judging
[1:17:55] but those are the things those are the
[1:17:56] words that go with that knowledge we
[1:17:58] must have Holy Ghost knowledge to go to
[1:18:01] temperance
[1:18:03] to go to patients to go to not godliness
[1:18:07] but the spirit of wisdom I pray that
[1:18:10] this year the spirit of wisdom will come
[1:18:11] into this church more and more
[1:18:14] wisdom to discern wisdom to do the right
[1:18:17] thing wisdom for all of us to do the
[1:18:20] right thing wisdom for us to get in our
[1:18:22] position know what we're supposed to do
[1:18:23] and do it all right
[1:18:26] and not be tossed about with every wind
[1:18:28] of Doctrine we we shouldn't that that
[1:18:31] should be one of those things that we
[1:18:32] move over to the side we don't have
[1:18:34] false Doctrine here I don't believe I
[1:18:37] don't believe I'm telling you I don't
[1:18:38] believe you might believe it but I don't
[1:18:39] believe we have false Doctrine okay if
[1:18:41] we don't have false Doctrine then take
[1:18:42] that and put it over to the side
[1:18:45] put that over to the side we've we've
[1:18:47] we've won that war right we won that
[1:18:49] battle in other words not war we won
[1:18:51] that battle that battle is what
[1:18:53] let's work on something else let's start
[1:18:54] sharpening let's stand to our feet let's
[1:18:56] start sharpening our short and whatever
[1:18:58] the devil's got for us this year
[1:19:01] hack him
[1:19:04] what brother Ernie say hack him smack
[1:19:06] him cut him
[1:19:09] if he knocks her teeth out we gum him to
[1:19:12] death
[1:19:13] that's right what else what else does he
[1:19:15] say
[1:19:16] I I miss brother Ernie
[1:19:19] I miss him a lot I was looking online
[1:19:21] last night they have that memorial
[1:19:22] service for him and I thought man he's
[1:19:25] just gone
[1:19:27] he's gone but you know what
[1:19:29] he went when God knew he was going to go
[1:19:33] that's right he meant when God was
[1:19:35] finished with that man he was done with
[1:19:36] him because I believe that man was a man
[1:19:38] of God I believe he led many people to
[1:19:40] the Lord I Believe by his testimony he
[1:19:43] led a lot of listen to me he led a lot
[1:19:45] of intellectual people that maybe we
[1:19:47] couldn't have got to
[1:19:49] him doing those seminars for the you
[1:19:50] know the other for people you know like
[1:19:52] in sales and all that he was able to
[1:19:55] touch their heart where we wouldn't be
[1:19:57] able to touch it I believe every
[1:19:58] Ministry has a has a part to play that
[1:20:00] nobody else can play that part you've
[1:20:02] got a part that you can deal with this
[1:20:03] certain thing and then the other
[1:20:04] minister comes in he deals with this
[1:20:06] certain thing May preach the same sermon
[1:20:09] it's just a little way that you bring it
[1:20:13] it goes over into this angle so it'll
[1:20:15] help you and it goes over this angle so
[1:20:16] it can help the other person
[1:20:20] because God's obligated to what
[1:20:22] his word
[1:20:23] he's not obligated to me and you he's
[1:20:25] obligated to his word
[1:20:27] his word will set you free
[1:20:30] this world will bind you
[1:20:33] this world will smack you and hack you
[1:20:35] if you'll let it
[1:20:39] but I don't want to be The Hunted
[1:20:45] let's go hunting
[1:20:47] we don't have to hunt the truth truth's
[1:20:49] here
[1:20:50] we hunt souls and we hunt a better way
[1:20:52] to live a better way to act
[1:20:55] a better way to show people around you
[1:20:57] God
[1:21:00] that's my prayer for this year
[1:21:02] help me Lord like I said before I know
[1:21:04] New Year's resolution we're going to get
[1:21:06] New Year's revelation
[1:21:09] I just read you brother Brian said
[1:21:10] there's no prevailing power what is
[1:21:13] prevailing that means it goes over every
[1:21:14] other power
[1:21:16] there's no prevailing power except for
[1:21:18] Revelation then you need to pray for
[1:21:21] Revelation the prophet said above
[1:21:23] anything pray for revelation God I need
[1:21:26] a revelation
[1:21:27] because you know you can put things that

[1:28:00] natural natural husband and wife but we
[1:28:03] love you all man I tell you
[1:28:06] um this past week's been a struggle but
[1:28:09] uh
[1:28:10] we're gonna and it's a better struggle
[1:28:12] because I've had to take care of June I
[1:28:14] know what y'all were thinking are y'all
[1:28:15] thinking that I discerned that because
[1:28:17] the women are rolling their eyes you
[1:28:18] know
[1:28:20] no it's not because of her no
[1:28:23] but but we did say you know the by we we
[1:28:26] talk about our bowels some of you that
[1:28:28] forgot your vows that says better or
[1:28:29] worse
[1:28:31] sickness and in health
[1:28:35] richer or poor right
[1:28:38] that's what you said and you promised
[1:28:40] before God to do with your spouse
[1:28:43] rich or poor sickness and health
[1:28:47] till death do us part
[1:28:49] wow
[1:28:51] a lot of people break that vow you know
[1:28:52] there's a lot of people standing to
[1:28:53] pulpit and they'll say that and it won't
[1:28:55] be long before they break those loud
[1:28:57] you know what that vow brother Brown
[1:28:58] what did he say he said he said the man
[1:29:00] he said no your vow is what marries you
[1:29:03] to that woman your vow to say I'll take
[1:29:06] you it's going to be really good in
[1:29:08] about 18 to 20 years old not a problem
[1:29:10] but when you get 65
[1:29:13] and 70.
[1:29:15] it's going to test that vow that you
[1:29:18] made several years ago
[1:29:21] but you know what
[1:29:24] it's no better thing than that right
[1:29:26] there other than the Salvation is to
[1:29:28] have a wonderful wife and a wonderful
[1:29:29] husband and we appreciate that
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:36] was God Did It folks I promise you that
[1:29:38] yeah it wasn't me wasn't my it wasn't my
[1:29:41] good sense to do that don't you smile
[1:29:46] you know you need to get a little bit
[1:29:48] taller if you're going to be the same as
[1:29:49] your brother back there you're going to
[1:29:51] wear you some like
[1:29:52] well they don't make 12 inch shoes I
[1:29:54] don't think
[1:29:55] because you need to be up here and
[1:29:57] talking instead of being done here like
[1:29:58] this
[1:29:59] we can get you that little booster so
[1:30:00] you can stand over there but why did
