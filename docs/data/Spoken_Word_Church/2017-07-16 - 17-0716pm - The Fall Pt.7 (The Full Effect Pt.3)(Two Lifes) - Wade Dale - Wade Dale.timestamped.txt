[12:07] raise our hands your holy holy holy holy
[12:21] holy mine you could say that for a
[12:31] million years and it still wouldn't even
[12:33] be worthy holy holy holy Lord got on
[12:37] money good to be in the house of the
[12:40] Lord could have each and every one of
[12:42] you here all smiling and feeling good
[12:47] everybody doing alright at least doing a
[12:50] good job leading saying good good to
[12:51] have everybody back I know Bob's life's
[12:54] not back yet and June will be here in a
[12:55] few minutes so we'll have both of them
[12:58] back get everybody back together again I
[13:01] like it when the teams together I don't
[13:03] like it when they're all separated all
[13:05] out in different places so we have a
[13:07] good team and a good support team so
[13:09] it's good to have good to have them here
[13:12] and I can remember years ago when it was
[13:16] a it was a miracle to just have a piano
[13:18] player
[13:19] daddy remember that lead singing
[13:21] preaching deacon clean the charts all in
[13:24] one person but now the Lord blessed us
[13:27] over the years too to be able to put
[13:29] together a good a good team so and
[13:32] that's okay but I'd rather be on God's
[13:34] team then just be this team but but now
[13:39] it can be this team and God's team we
[13:41] can put them together and it will be
[13:42] wonderful some we thank all of you for
[13:46] coming we are going to probably try to
[13:50] step on a little few things that brother
[13:52] Dale couldn't
[13:53] to this morning there's a few few new
[13:56] ones here so and that's alright that's I
[13:59] feel sorry for him sometimes he won't go
[14:01] he's like huh it's like a horse at the
[14:03] Kentucky Derby you know he's getting
[14:06] ready and then somebody comes in he goes
[14:09] thank you but that's okay but really
[14:13] it's not a problem because you know what
[14:15] before the foundation of the world God
[14:16] knew they'd be here and knew that they
[14:19] didn't have to listen to a certain
[14:21] sermon so we you know we don't we don't
[14:24] I wish you had new ones every service
[14:26] hey ma'am I just wish they'd come back
[14:28] and stay anyway and you know you never
[14:34] know you plant a seed come up a little
[14:36] bit later sometimes so let's turn to 2nd
[14:39] Corinthians and back where we were again
[14:41] but we're going to kind of go to another
[14:45] level at them for the time this would be
[14:48] to life's part 3 but we're going to talk
[14:52] about building his family because that's
[14:56] what Christ came to do he came to build
[14:58] his family and release the life so that
[15:04] we can have two life because if you had
[15:06] just one life the first life Rome the
[15:11] first life dying the first life had a
[15:14] beginning the first life is going to
[15:15] have an end so we had to come somebody
[15:17] come down to this life and man give His
[15:21] life so that we could go to eternal life
[15:23] ma'am so we'll get to that in just a few
[15:25] minutes but if you would turn to 2nd
[15:27] Corinthians 5 verse 1 they'll have it up
[15:29] on the screen and then we'll read
[15:31] Galatians 2 verse 20 and then we're kind
[15:34] of background a few minutes and then
[15:35] we'll carry on all right let's bow our
[15:38] heads there Heavenly Father we pray Lord
[15:40] then you'll be with us today as an
[15:42] active participant in the service you do
[15:44] the speaking you do the hearing you'd be
[15:47] the one Lord that gives revelation
[15:48] father we pray that you would just be
[15:50] with the ones that are traveling sister
[15:52] Monica and June ones that are not here
[15:54] it will bring them all back safe home
[15:56] Lord we pray that you just be with the
[15:58] ones that are not here that are sick
[16:00] that you just touched them sister Glenn
[16:02] some of the ones that went home just
[16:04] touch them father and give them strength
[16:05] blessed each one today
[16:07] give us a charge of energy to make it
[16:10] through this time and then a super
[16:13] charge of energy to make it through
[16:15] Monday through Wednesday till we come
[16:18] back Lord because truly that's this
[16:20] world is getting dark the pressure is
[16:23] beginning to push on each one of us but
[16:26] you told us Lord you said the bride
[16:28] would not be pushed out she'd be pushed
[16:30] up so we are thankful that you gave us a
[16:33] prophet that would tell us these things
[16:35] that would point us to you and now as we
[16:39] speak about you Lord you come and reveal
[16:42] yourself
[16:43] probably just bless the missionaries
[16:45] that are coming in be with the ones that
[16:47] are still in the foreign fields give
[16:48] them fruit for their labor the ones that
[16:50] are coming in Lord just give them good
[16:52] traveling mercy it will all be made
[16:55] together a new father
[16:56] let's give us this day our daily bread
[16:57] and jesus name amen
[17:00] second corinthians five verse one for we
[17:02] know that if our earthly house of this
[17:04] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[17:06] building of God a house not made with
[17:09] hands eternal in the heavens for in this
[17:12] we groan earnestly desiring to be
[17:15] clothed upon with our house which is
[17:17] from heaven if so be that being clothed
[17:20] we shall not be found naked for we that
[17:23] are in this tabernacle do groan being
[17:25] burdened not for that we would be
[17:28] unclothed but clothed upon that
[17:30] mortality might be swallowed up of this
[17:33] life that we're talking about a man this
[17:36] new life a man because the old life is
[17:38] going to pass away there's no doubt the
[17:40] old life is going to pass away but it's
[17:43] going to pack to the to us that are
[17:44] Christians it should have already passed
[17:46] away man because we should be born in
[17:49] newness of life alright we'll talk about
[17:51] that in a minute Galatians 2 verse 20
[17:53] says I am crucified with Christ I didn't
[17:57] know this was brother Bob's favorite
[18:00] scripture till Wednesday night I'm
[18:02] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[18:03] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[18:07] and the life which I now live in this
[18:11] flesh I didn't have to go somewhere else
[18:13] to live this life I'm living this life
[18:15] right here in my flesh the life which I
[18:19] now live in the flesh I live by the
[18:20] faith of
[18:21] son of God who loved me and gave himself
[18:23] for me you may be seated in the Lord add
[18:26] his blessing to the reading of the word
[18:29] now as we get started we'll look and see
[18:32] that come in building his family there
[18:36] were certain things that God had to do
[18:38] and there were certain things that he
[18:40] didn't have to do because he's God and
[18:43] his brother Dale has been telling us
[18:45] about God and he doesn't change there
[18:47] was there was no way he could come up
[18:49] with a better plan there was no way that
[18:51] that he could somehow get down the road
[18:54] hey sweetheart
[18:56] change made it back so we got one of
[18:58] them back Bobby Oh sweetheart be here
[19:00] about five o'clock so we'll be okay all
[19:02] right so anyway we come to this place to
[19:04] where we see these two lights and we we
[19:08] know I know in my flesh I used to live
[19:12] one life and now I live another life but
[19:16] now remember you can't kill this life
[19:20] because you still have to live we still
[19:23] are alive Paul but Paul says I am
[19:26] crucified with Christ in other words
[19:29] he's putting his identity back to that
[19:30] Genesis 1:26 man that come what here
[19:34] with Christ when Christ came to this
[19:37] earth he brought that Genesis 1:26 man
[19:40] with him amen and we'll look at that in
[19:42] just a second because remember back in
[19:44] the Old Testament and I'm going to
[19:45] explain today it was a brought to my
[19:51] attention that sometimes when we say
[19:53] well there was no one born again in the
[19:55] Old Testament and we just kind of just
[19:57] say a few things and go on well I'm
[19:59] going to go back and we're going to read
[20:01] some scripture and we're going to show
[20:02] that that the Bible tells us that
[20:05] there's no way a person not one person
[20:09] in that Old Testament besides Adam who
[20:12] was imparted eternal life which was not
[20:15] a new birth he wasn't birth he was he
[20:20] was created a grown man and God put that
[20:23] Genesis 1:26 man eternal life into that
[20:26] man okay so he didn't have to grow up as
[20:28] a baby he never came out of a womb but
[20:32] now remember what happened in the fall
[20:34] brought up
[20:35] through the womb so now we had to be all
[20:38] be born babies there's nobody on the
[20:40] earth since jeet sent some Adam got here
[20:45] full-grown man we got here the baby
[20:49] everybody you see guy here the same way
[20:51] I don't care you walk through billions
[20:53] of people they all got here same way
[20:55] alright so but God's going to take that
[20:58] same way and he's going to turn it and
[21:01] make it work for his good he's going to
[21:04] bring he knew we would have two lifes
[21:07] and then he knew that so there's nothing
[21:11] new Under the Sun and there's nothing
[21:13] new that that I know there's things new
[21:16] to us but remember to God nothing's new
[21:20] remember he's already seen this he's
[21:22] it's already happened in his great
[21:24] intelligence and we'll read it in a few
[21:26] minutes we're brother Brent talks about
[21:27] foreknowledge but let's look and see
[21:31] though in the Old Testament and I'm just
[21:33] going to go you don't have to pull these
[21:34] up but remember we've been talking about
[21:36] Abraham meet Melchizedek well who did he
[21:38] meet he met God in human flesh right but
[21:42] it was not the god Savior in human flesh
[21:45] and then it was a it was to be and I'll
[21:48] read it in a few minutes the Bible tells
[21:51] us or this morning I was showing them
[21:53] brother the lease did a good job of
[21:55] talking about looking back you know it's
[21:59] not it's not bad to look back but
[22:01] looking back to the Word of God you
[22:03] should but now looking back on your old
[22:07] first life nature well don't worry you
[22:10] don't have to look by Satan we'll bring
[22:12] it up right he says I said his job is to
[22:15] bring what you did but I told him yes
[22:18] this morning I said I was sitting
[22:20] yesterday or day before yesterday I said
[22:22] God because something came to my mind
[22:24] that I did a long time ago and I said
[22:27] god I just forgive me of that and if we
[22:31] would have been in the dimension of God
[22:32] sitting on the throne God would have
[22:35] looked over and said what are you
[22:37] talking about what are you talking about
[22:43] if that sin that's why the property God
[22:46] couldn't see sin under the blood
[22:48] why it wasn't just under there hiding it
[22:52] wasn't there to begin with and man
[22:56] that's what you and I've got to look at
[22:57] and see that this new life this Genesis
[23:00] 1:26 man is so supernatural till it is
[23:05] just like God it's not finite it's
[23:10] infinite it never sinned today never had
[23:13] a day that it began never had an end and
[23:16] never sinned a man because if it did if
[23:19] there's one mark against that soul of
[23:23] God that come into you then you have to
[23:26] go back and say God you made me do this
[23:28] our God it's your fault that I can't get
[23:31] rid of the sin nobody I'm tell you
[23:33] something there's not his fault it's our
[23:35] fault amen because we leaned back to
[23:38] that oh damn it nature you know you look
[23:40] and see things like that you think we'll
[23:42] well at some times this is easy to
[23:44] forget well there's a lot of things that
[23:46] are really hard to forget but one
[23:47] thing's for sure if you've truly
[23:49] repented it doesn't matter how many
[23:51] times you ask God to forgive you it's
[23:54] done what sins are you talking about I
[23:58] got preaching brother Burleigh's where
[24:00] where God was working on that
[24:03] masterpiece and and I gave a little
[24:05] illustration of Satan leaning over and
[24:06] saying God don't you see them down then
[24:08] them people down there they leaving the
[24:10] message and they shut up Satan I got
[24:12] work to do that's all got to shut up
[24:15] Satan I got work to do he's not worried
[24:17] about the devil he don't even sure he
[24:20] might turn and say something to him but
[24:21] he don't even have to and then what sins
[24:24] are you talking about I thought I
[24:27] thought Christ died on the cross to take
[24:29] away sin not just cover it because
[24:33] that's what I think about brother Brown
[24:34] said well if it's placed under the blood
[24:36] and we as humans think well we you know
[24:38] it's something is something is placed
[24:40] under the blood well then it's still
[24:42] there no when it goes through that
[24:45] bleached blood it's gone you can't find
[24:47] it anymore that's why the Prophet
[24:49] couldn't find it because it wasn't there
[24:52] and that's our problem you know what we
[24:54] do put it back out again
[25:01] we'll read it in a minute the reason the
[25:05] blood of bulls and goats couldn't take
[25:07] away sin is that room as a remembrance
[25:09] and we'll read about it was a
[25:11] remembrance of sin every year when that
[25:13] priest went behind that belt everybody
[25:15] in Israel knew they were sinning they
[25:18] knew what he was going to do but let's
[25:20] let's read it in the Bible this I'm
[25:22] getting ahead of myself but Abraham
[25:24] meets Melchizedek twice Moses meets milk
[25:27] meets God in theophany remember he walks
[25:31] by and then Joshua met him as the
[25:33] captain of the hosts many times God
[25:35] comes through the Old Testament and what
[25:38] he does though he shows his self as a
[25:41] pillar fire or as a the one that was in
[25:44] the fire the one that spoke from heaven
[25:46] the one that spoke from different places
[25:47] but remember one thing's for sure it was
[25:51] always God Almighty it wasn't to take a
[25:54] person it wasn't a third person it was
[25:56] God busying himself with his people even
[25:59] in the Old Testament even though he
[26:01] could not see them he was there and then
[26:07] because remember that's why in the old
[26:12] and back in the Garden of Eden God made
[26:16] that sacrifice and then many times we
[26:18] we've heard this before but I'm going to
[26:20] say it again that before the foundation
[26:22] of the world though they'll read it that
[26:24] we stood as a lamb slain before the
[26:26] foundation where God made sure God made
[26:29] sure that everything brother Larry was
[26:31] covered because he did it before the
[26:34] foundation of the world before that
[26:36] Genesis 1:26 man that Genesis 1:29 26
[26:41] men come out then the two seven men
[26:43] before any of that he was already slain
[26:46] in the mind of God so you're covered
[26:49] that's our problem we think there's a
[26:51] part in there that God didn't cover he
[26:55] wouldn't be eternally he wouldn't be
[26:57] perfect if that happened man he is
[26:59] infinite he is eternal and there is an
[27:02] eternal qualities the prophet of God
[27:04] said to me and you a man a man there's
[27:09] an eternal property to the II leg what
[27:11] if that Genesis 1:20
[27:13] six man and then so here we go now Jesus
[27:17] Christ which we should we showed that
[27:18] brother Brown called him King theophany
[27:20] so there was there's no other theophany
[27:24] spilt at Rome there's no other theophany
[27:27] that I'm worried with and that's the
[27:31] eternal it's not funny
[27:34] spellcheck didn't work on my computer so
[27:38] it's not softening it's a king theophany
[27:41] see yeah we've had that up there three
[27:44] times and nobody's seen it so anyway
[27:46] we'll fix that
[27:47] but God in building is family now for me
[27:52] for me to say and I'm going to say
[27:54] something here and I hope you don't
[27:56] misunderstand because brother Dale
[27:57] talked about the book there is one book
[28:00] that has pictures in it and all the
[28:04] other books don't have pictures why
[28:08] would God want to take a picture of a
[28:09] sinner hello if I go to Donny's house
[28:15] don't even do anything for me he'd do
[28:17] anything for my family but I'm not a
[28:19] publisher so when I go in and I look at
[28:22] all his pictures of his family I don't
[28:25] find my picture in there why I'm not a
[28:29] published so God has not got he's only
[28:33] got one book that's got pictures in it
[28:35] because it's his family members hey man
[28:38] if his children will read that in just a
[28:40] few minutes but I look let's read our
[28:42] first quoting and bring him down
[28:45] properly God said in 2 min 1957 and no
[28:48] then no doubt in my mind but that's what
[28:50] Jesus had in his mind and I thought
[28:53] about that this morning look see that
[28:56] word infallibility we've got to realize
[29:00] now listen to me that Genesis wants what
[29:03] them brother Lewis was speaking this
[29:05] morning and I got something else on the
[29:08] Genesis 1:26 men because remember we
[29:11] talked about the infallibility of God
[29:12] right God is infallible we know that
[29:16] well then that Genesis 1:26 man is
[29:18] infallible
[29:21] hello against is 1:26 man comes straight
[29:25] from God it's
[29:26] part of God it is as infallible as God
[29:29] is a man so look there's no doubt in my
[29:32] mind and I was thinking this morning
[29:34] brother Dale and correct me if I'm wrong
[29:37] Paul says we must have the mind of
[29:39] Christ well why can't we take that word
[29:42] out and put soul in we must have the
[29:47] soul of Christ oh you don't know you
[29:52] have if you're born again you got the
[29:54] soul of Christ now we know there's a
[29:57] mind that we think with but remember the
[30:00] mind of Christ
[30:01] when he came on earth he didn't have a
[30:04] carnal mind that's our problem the Bible
[30:07] says the carnal mind is enmity to God
[30:09] not the mind of Christ
[30:13] am I going too far here it's like the we
[30:17] said he said when we say I and my father
[30:19] are one or I come from God and I go back
[30:22] to God there's people in the message
[30:24] that have questioned him because saying
[30:25] that please people we haven't said it
[30:28] enough we haven't got ourselves to
[30:31] believe that's where we came from My
[30:34] heavens where'd you come from and were
[30:38] you going back to where were you last
[30:44] time day afternoon
[30:46] well we'll look at in just a second okay
[30:49] in fact flipped your switch then it just
[30:51] lifts you switch but that's what Jesus
[30:54] had in his mind when he was here on
[30:57] earth was that infallibility of God's
[31:00] eternal Word for we know that in him
[31:03] dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[31:05] the entire Godhead was in him he was
[31:07] both Father Son and Holy Ghost but weld
[31:10] in the human form that the Alpha knee of
[31:12] God the great image of God that he made
[31:16] man in them placed him in the earth he
[31:18] had a body and then so Jesus Christ came
[31:23] with the ability to produce that Genesis
[31:26] 1:26 man Adam was given potential
[31:29] ability to do it and he really messed it
[31:32] up amen
[31:34] he went to the carnal mind and then what
[31:38] did God tell him in the garden
[31:40] see to me that's the great promise and
[31:42] we'll talk about in just a minute the
[31:43] great promise glogg said in genesis 3:15
[31:46] to me that's one of the most powerful
[31:48] scriptures in the Bible because it says
[31:51] I'll put enmity between you and her
[31:55] seeds but anyway in other words I'm
[31:57] coming and whatever gap that there is
[32:00] I'm going to fill it in and then the
[32:03] promise the prophet of God said the
[32:05] promise of the woman sees what Jesus
[32:07] Christ was the woman sees he's the only
[32:09] one that could produce what we needed no
[32:14] other man could that's why in the Old
[32:16] Testament you couldn't find the person
[32:19] they had the new birth you can find it
[32:21] the person had the Holy Ghost in their
[32:22] soul amen
[32:23] but dwelt in the human forms as he often
[32:25] in God the great image of God that he
[32:27] made man in then placed him in the earth
[32:29] he had a body God isn't without a body
[32:31] God's got a body and it looks like a man
[32:34] Moses saw it others saw it and it looked
[32:36] like a man all right we already read
[32:39] that several times now look let's go to
[32:43] John now what happened is we're going to
[32:45] look at this what we call the promise
[32:47] we're going to read in a few minutes you
[32:50] say what is the promise listen if we
[32:53] didn't get a promise of a new life if we
[32:57] didn't get a promise of a new life our
[32:59] old life was going to take us to hell
[33:01] and then we needed a promise and what
[33:05] happened in Hebrews 11 we'll see that
[33:10] they received a good report to faith but
[33:13] did not receive the promise and then
[33:16] they had to go into Abraham's bosom they
[33:18] couldn't go into the presence of God why
[33:20] because their sin went with them sorry
[33:25] but that's the truth if we dies
[33:28] Christians our sin doesn't go before us
[33:30] in that soul of man you're going to
[33:35] understand something one day when you
[33:36] got born again brother man said that was
[33:38] the most important thing that took every
[33:40] sin in your life away from you in your
[33:43] soul what was this thing okay now look
[33:49] remember he promised us a new life he
[33:53] in promised us a perfect life down here
[33:56] that perfect life is coming but you had
[33:59] to get the promise of a new life down
[34:01] here to get rid of the old life that you
[34:04] had a man that's why David under the
[34:08] inspiration of the Holy Ghost he could
[34:10] say they pierced my hands and my feet
[34:12] and they he could write the whole song
[34:15] speaking of Jesus Christ
[34:18] but then that anointing would leave in
[34:20] me and he would go and have his best
[34:22] friend kill so he could have her
[34:24] relations with now see a Holy Ghost fell
[34:26] persons that will never happen I said
[34:29] the Holy Ghost fell person would never
[34:32] do something like that Moses was a
[34:35] murderer
[34:37] Abraham led twice give his life away
[34:43] twice did God impute that not when he
[34:47] looked through the blood he didn't he
[34:49] looked back through Calvary and Peter
[34:51] and Paul wrote having great faith not
[34:55] staggered not at the promise of God
[34:57] sometimes that's hard for us to see you
[34:59] think man that dude staggered his whole
[35:01] life but not in God's eyes he didn't now
[35:05] what did Jesus promise because remember
[35:08] our first life that we were born in was
[35:10] born in sin all right so he gave us a
[35:13] promise and I will pray the father and
[35:16] he shall give you another comforter that
[35:17] he may abide with you forever even the
[35:21] Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[35:24] receive so remember the whole world is
[35:27] not going to see this new life the whole
[35:30] the whole world is not going to receive
[35:32] this promise amen
[35:34] all right because it seeth him not
[35:36] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[35:42] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[35:45] all right now there's your promise I
[35:47] will not leave you comfortless or here's
[35:50] a promise I will come to you not to your
[35:54] group not to your doctrine or your
[35:58] religion or your denomination I'm going
[36:01] to come to you yet a little while and
[36:05] the world seeth me know
[36:06] or but you see me now how we seem we
[36:11] understand him we were by revelation we
[36:13] understand see we contractures like
[36:16] brother Dale said we can we know what he
[36:18] looks like but we can track his whole
[36:19] movement we can we can track him from
[36:22] the foundation before the foundation of
[36:24] the world all the way to the future home
[36:26] because God sent us a prophet that could
[36:28] raise up go into the mind of God the
[36:31] mind of God how'd he get in the mind of
[36:32] God he had the mind of God that's how
[36:36] they could connect and then that's how
[36:39] he can get up in the mind of God because
[36:40] he already had the mind of God and then
[36:43] yet a little while in the world said me
[36:45] no more but you see me because I live
[36:47] you shall live also and that day and
[36:51] what proper God say that was this day
[36:52] and that day you shall know that I am in
[36:56] my father and ye and me and I and you
[36:59] now if cliff if the prophet of God told
[37:02] us that the scriptures there speaks of
[37:04] the bridegroom also speaks of the bride
[37:07] Amen in me I and you where ever he that
[37:14] that's where we are wherever we are
[37:16] that's where he's at and you know what
[37:18] he's pleased to be there alright in John
[37:22] 14:26 but the comforter which is the
[37:25] Holy Ghost now see John brings it right
[37:27] down and shows and God this is you know
[37:30] Christ speaking he's not leaving
[37:32] anything out telling you what the
[37:35] comforter is the comforter which is the
[37:37] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[37:40] my name that's why we're going to see
[37:43] that name come over and book of Acts
[37:44] well send in my name he shall teach you
[37:47] all things and bring all things to your
[37:51] remembrance now look not the minded mom
[37:54] and daddy gave you not them not the
[37:56] carnal mind he's bringing you what you
[37:59] thought he's bringing you a new life
[38:03] bring to your remembrance whatsoever I
[38:06] have said unto you the promise of
[38:13] eternal life now let's back up on
[38:16] Hebrews 9 and let's read
[38:20] going on here because God can't go past
[38:25] his word God has to go through his word
[38:29] alright so now let's go to them Hebrews
[38:32] 9 6 all right now here's Paul speaking
[38:37] now when these things were thus ordained
[38:39] the priest 1 always into the first
[38:41] tyrannize oh now we're selling the Old
[38:43] Testament and I told burly's kids
[38:46] birdies kids I told his people we were
[38:49] talking about the where there was the
[38:51] first book of the New Testament what you
[38:52] think that's technical but it's not it
[38:54] really helps me because I'm going to
[38:56] read to you why that the New Testament
[38:58] started on the book of Acts not in the
[39:00] book of Mathew and then the Bible tells
[39:03] you why all right the priest went always
[39:08] into the first time when I go
[39:09] accomplishing the service of God but
[39:11] into the second went the high priests
[39:13] remember that was only two veils you had
[39:17] you outer Court veil enter court veil
[39:20] Holy of Holies so he's talking about
[39:22] here the high priest could only be the
[39:24] one that goes in to the Holy of Holies
[39:25] right right which is a type of what your
[39:29] soul a man your soul but into the second
[39:32] went the high priest alone once every
[39:35] year not without blood he took the blood
[39:38] which he offered for himself and for the
[39:42] errors of the people the Holy Ghost this
[39:47] signifying that the way into the holiest
[39:50] of all was not yet made manifest there's
[39:55] the key in your answer right there the
[39:57] Holy Ghost this signifying that the way
[40:01] into the holiest of all was not yet made
[40:04] manifest while as the first hibernal was
[40:08] yet standing which was the whole
[40:10] Testament and then sure they'd knock it
[40:13] down the building back they knocking
[40:15] down that built it back but they always
[40:16] out of Harvard I know a man which was a
[40:20] figure or an example which was a figure
[40:25] for the time then present in which were
[40:28] offered both gifts and sacrifices that
[40:31] could not make him that did the service
[40:34] perfect as pertaining to the conscience
[40:39] what the conscious carmine which stood
[40:44] only in meats and drinks and divers
[40:46] washings and carnal ordinances imposed
[40:48] on them until the time of reformation so
[40:53] it was going toward something right but
[40:55] Christ being come as a high priest of
[40:58] good things to come by a greater and
[41:01] more perfect Tabernacle his body not
[41:06] made with hands that is to say not of
[41:08] this building here neither by the blood
[41:11] of bulls and calves but by his own blood
[41:15] he entered in once into the holy place
[41:19] having obtained eternal redemption for
[41:23] us now that to me explains it right
[41:27] there the death we'll see in a minute
[41:32] you had to have a death of someone that
[41:35] had a soul someone that had eternal life
[41:39] in their soul if you if his job was to
[41:42] bring us back then he had to have a soul
[41:46] to connect with our soul amen
[41:51] bulls and goats couldn't do it to me
[41:56] it's so simple but you you say this in a
[41:58] congregation and they go quiet you know
[42:01] why they don't understand but we do
[42:04] thank God and we're understanding more
[42:07] we're not just we're not just understood
[42:09] and we're done now look neither by the
[42:11] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[42:13] blood
[42:14] why because the life send the blood and
[42:17] then the life was in the blood that
[42:19] could what speak and do some good in the
[42:22] animal it was just there God just said
[42:25] I'll in other words I'm going to allow
[42:27] this to happen
[42:28] until I come but when I get here I'm
[42:32] going to bring you a life that you're
[42:34] not going to be able to get from mommy
[42:36] and daddy and you're not going to be
[42:38] able to get coverage from the high
[42:41] priest and then the high priest can give
[42:44] them eternal life why
[42:45] every year same thing every year next
[42:51] year same thing next year same thing
[42:55] alright for if the blood of bulls and of
[42:58] goats and the ashes of an heifer
[42:59] sprinkling the unclean now look
[43:02] watch this it did do some good in the
[43:08] Old Testament right there's your right
[43:09] there's your answer it covered their sin
[43:13] its sanctifies to the purifying of the
[43:16] flesh not the soul now how much more
[43:22] shall the blood of Christ who through
[43:25] the Eternal Spirit offered himself
[43:27] without spot to God purge your
[43:32] conscience from dead works to serve the
[43:34] Living God he asked the question and for
[43:37] this cause he is the mediator of the New
[43:41] Testament that by means of death for the
[43:46] redemption of the transgressions that
[43:48] were under the first Testament what the
[43:51] Old Testament amen look they which are
[43:54] called might receive the promise of
[43:56] inter eternal inheritance in other words
[43:59] the New Testament for where a testament
[44:04] is there must also am necessity be the
[44:08] death of the testator something had to
[44:12] die for a testament is of force after
[44:16] men are dead otherwise it is of no
[44:21] strength at all while the testator
[44:24] liveth in other words Matthew Mark Luke
[44:26] and John the testator was alive a man
[44:31] sure right over two very ending in the
[44:33] chapter he died but what was the next
[44:36] thing come up the book like Jesus said
[44:38] go what go to Jerusalem you'll be endued
[44:40] with power from on high
[44:41] why because the testator had died and
[44:43] listen to what he says right here
[44:45] because we read it we read it all the
[44:47] time for the let's go to Matthew 26 and
[44:55] he took the cup and gave thanks and gave
[44:57] it to them saying drink ye all of it
[44:59] this is my blood of the New Testament
[45:01] and then which he shed for many for the
[45:06] remission of sins he was going to
[45:09] Calvary to die for our sins
[45:12] amen not to just hide them but to do
[45:17] away with us cuz I thought it said
[45:19] eternal Redemption amen
[45:24] done all rights amen
[45:27] because remember even though we'll not
[45:31] sure we have things now we're real
[45:32] modern we have living wills and all that
[45:34] stuff but a will can't be read until a
[45:36] person dies there has to be a death amen
[45:41] you don't go read a will I don't think
[45:44] I've ever seen anybody read the will was
[45:45] the person sitting in the room that
[45:47] wrote it he's usually gone on to another
[45:50] route to another in another dimension
[45:52] right why because he left a will and
[45:55] what Testament right amen so God left us
[46:00] a will and testament
[46:02] the will being this hello the will being
[46:08] this now watch he died in flesh that all
[46:16] rights a man but now watch this quote I
[46:19] love and this is when I read when I'm
[46:23] talking about this and buddy you talking
[46:25] about people being quiet
[46:26] I reckon they don't study enough to read
[46:29] this we read it a hundred times I'm
[46:30] gonna read it again doctrine series 1960
[46:34] the other man said inheritance by
[46:36] predestination I inherited something
[46:40] what inheritance there had to be
[46:44] somebody leave me an inheritance number
[46:48] one you got to have the inheritance
[46:50] first I can't give you ten million
[46:54] dollars if I've got ten dollars
[46:56] hello but if somebody's got eternal life
[47:02] okay why you say Jesus left you an
[47:07] inheritance beg your pardon
[47:11] Jesus never left being inherited Jesus
[47:16] never left you an inheritance he only
[47:19] came down and paid for your inheritance
[47:22] brought you to your inheritance but your
[47:26] name what brother Dale told me last
[47:28] Sunday but your name was put on the
[47:30] Lamb's Book of Life
[47:31] before the foundation of the world
[47:34] signed sealed and delivered that's not
[47:39] in the quote if you know if you're not
[47:41] reading them if you're listening that's
[47:42] not in the quote okay that's me that's
[47:44] that's a way close
[47:45] that's a interpolation okay I
[47:48] interpolated do what now sure sure it's
[47:53] exactly what it was but your name was
[47:55] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[47:57] the foundation of the world God give you
[48:00] your inheritance your inheritance was
[48:02] first and then Jesus only come a lot
[48:06] here's the way they try to make it God
[48:08] said well there's a lot of people own I
[48:10] don't want them I don't want be saved so
[48:13] I've sent Jesus down and perhaps may
[48:15] know that a lot of people think this
[48:17] that God just sent Jesus down here and
[48:20] and if somebody would accept him that's
[48:23] good if they don't know my heaven
[48:25] I'll send Jesus down there perhaps maybe
[48:28] he'll somebody will feel sorry I know
[48:31] what I've done and get saved
[48:32] Oh mercy I wouldn't run my office like
[48:34] that even as poor as I do run it
[48:36] sometime I wouldn't do it like that how
[48:39] about God Road up God by his
[48:41] foreknowledge seeing exactly who would
[48:45] be saved and who wouldn't be saved he
[48:48] sent Jesus in other words to get his
[48:50] children he sent Jesus to save those he
[48:55] had all ready chosen and then didn't
[48:59] Paul say five verses behind this that he
[49:01] chose us in him before there was even a
[49:04] world that's our inheritance God chose
[49:10] us and let Jesus come and pay the price
[49:13] Adam couldn't pay the price he wasn't a
[49:17] redeemer he did not have those
[49:18] attributes sure he was given the ability
[49:24] he was given the ability to bring us in
[49:27] to me but he lost it and when he went
[49:31] out he tried to come back and he
[49:33] couldn't come back because you know
[49:34] Savior amen
[49:35] they don't know one Savior in this world
[49:37] that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[49:40] the what his shedding of his blood that
[49:44] no sin would what let's all read that
[49:50] together that no sin that's pitiful say
[49:55] it with me that no sin would be
[50:00] accounted to us no sin that's our
[50:07] problem though that we pull back into
[50:09] the carnal mind into that first life and
[50:11] we start thinking about all things that
[50:13] we did and God's over here in this new
[50:15] life in already paid you didn't do it in
[50:19] the first place we'll see this one of
[50:22] these days but if he that sends
[50:26] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[50:28] of the truth there is no more sacrifice
[50:29] now and there's where you will rise up
[50:32] again and say how about that brother
[50:34] branham but just remember who have
[50:37] received the knowledge of the truth they
[50:39] never receive the truth they just
[50:42] received the knowledge of it I'm am
[50:44] that's why that's up here it didn't go
[50:48] down to here it was your mind not the
[50:51] mind of God because the mind the guards
[50:53] down here this is your brain this is
[50:57] what works with you right I don't know
[50:58] about you but this is where I think
[50:59] about some things I used to do and then
[51:03] but we got to realize though that that
[51:06] Genesis 1:26 man never did any of that
[51:08] never did one speck of sin and you got
[51:12] to be connected to that it's impossible
[51:15] for those who were once enlightened and
[51:17] made protectors of the Holy Ghost tasted
[51:20] the power of the good work like the
[51:22] borderline believers that watch that's
[51:24] what's happened today they got an
[51:27] anointing of the Holy Ghost all this the
[51:29] Geoff Jenkins and I'm going to call his
[51:30] name I don't care Geoff Jenkins and all
[51:32] them people like that sorry they never
[51:35] came they just got acknowledged
[51:38] the truth they said the message for 40
[51:41] years and then as soon as something one
[51:43] thing happens they just deny and go off
[51:45] and say well it's no good no you can't
[51:47] deny God's Word and have God in your
[51:50] soul you cannot now you cannot I didn't
[51:53] say you couldn't understand understand
[51:55] it you cannot understand and still have
[51:58] gone in your soul because to me that's
[52:00] your growth development mm that's God
[52:04] using what using the word of God to
[52:06] build you up but if what God does got to
[52:08] go push your filters out why brother
[52:10] Brown said the greatest battle ever
[52:12] faults in your heart no it said it's in
[52:13] your mind in your mind because if you're
[52:16] born again there's a battle why because
[52:20] to life to life amen all right everybody
[52:25] okay with that but beg your pardon Jesus
[52:27] never left me an inheritance Jesus never
[52:30] left you an inheritance he only came
[52:32] down and paid for your inheritance he
[52:35] says I am the way the truth and the life
[52:39] what the way back to this new life under
[52:43] this new testament because the old
[52:45] testament could only cover what you did
[52:48] but this new testament watch what paul
[52:51] right he writes even about abraham he
[52:53] looks back and he sees surely to
[52:55] goodness
[52:57] surely the goodness paul could read and
[53:00] he read come that's all he had he had
[53:04] the scroll he read where abraham live
[53:07] where abraham laughed Sarah just giggled
[53:10] in her heart and God said you the Bible
[53:14] says Abraham got down in front of God
[53:15] and laugh on the ground laughs when he
[53:18] told him he's gonna have a baby
[53:19] but when he looked back through the
[53:21] blood Paul looks back and goes strong
[53:23] and faith never wavered in other words
[53:27] just like me and you that first life
[53:30] there's no way there's no way you can
[53:35] still have that old life though and have
[53:37] the new life amen the life that I now
[53:43] live Paul said I live by what the faith
[53:47] of that mandate how long the cross
[53:49] that what he said that promise we hadn't
[53:53] got to that yet hang on a minute
[54:00] I'm a gift I may skip down guys let's
[54:03] skip to save a little time let's go to
[54:09] number three instead of two let's keep
[54:15] because I'm still not going to getting
[54:17] all the quotes but anyway that's okay
[54:20] but ill knows exactly what we're talking
[54:22] about but to listen
[54:25] revelations three fourteen to me shows
[54:32] it's just the beginning of the creation
[54:34] of God a man in other words the
[54:37] beginning of the New Testament there was
[54:39] no children of God I'm talking about
[54:42] born again even Nicodemus Nicodemus says
[54:46] must start going you know Nicodemus was
[54:48] in the first life he said must I go back
[54:51] into my mother's womb and come back out
[54:54] again the first life Christ said you
[54:57] know that's what's killing you that part
[55:01] is killing you you got to have a new
[55:03] life and be born from above not from
[55:07] your mother's womb again in other words
[55:10] he sent Nicodemus what's your problem
[55:13] well you know he knew what his problem
[55:15] was
[55:16] he didn't have eternal life in his soul
[55:18] in other words he had all the head
[55:21] knowledge of the Old Testament yet he
[55:22] could not bring it down through a filter
[55:24] that could say like Haiti right said
[55:26] that ain't nothing but the truth hey man
[55:28] all right so look in number three now
[55:31] we're going to read this and then we'll
[55:32] go to acts 2 because remember we're
[55:33] still on the promise questions and
[55:37] answers' 1957
[55:38] yes notice my Jehovah Witness friends
[55:41] I'd like to ask you about that see that
[55:44] hell is a place because remember
[55:46] remember Christ died the testator had to
[55:49] die for us to be under this New
[55:53] Testament and for that life and he came
[55:56] here with to go back into the believer
[55:58] is that all right here his body was in
[56:02] the grave
[56:03] go down to the red and it shoul was
[56:05] inhale now we read we read this but what
[56:07] within help reaching alive what about
[56:12] that he was Dennis theophany again why
[56:14] he had to come out of that body that
[56:16] body was what laying as a sacrifice but
[56:21] remember the Bible said in Isaiah which
[56:28] was one who has believed our report
[56:29] Isaiah 51 53 who has believed our report
[56:34] he says he gave his soul a ransom he
[56:40] gave his soul his body is laying up
[56:42] there in the grave as they what as a
[56:44] sacrifice that was the Lamb of God the
[56:47] Lambs got skin hello a lamb has skin so
[56:52] the Lamb of God was laying up there in
[56:54] other words remember look Jesus's soul
[56:56] never was bruised Jesus's soul never was
[57:00] you know beat it was that body that was
[57:03] beat that body is our sacrifice for our
[57:07] healing amen
[57:09] but when he separated that eternal soul
[57:13] went to hell as a ransom so that we
[57:17] don't have to go any more I've already
[57:19] told you that listen that's a promise to
[57:22] me that if I received that same life
[57:25] that theophany right there if I receive
[57:28] that theophany in me I don't have to do
[57:31] to hell
[57:32] I've already been and guess what I came
[57:37] out and they some keys come with it here
[57:45] his body was in the grave and his soul
[57:47] was at hell preaching alive what about
[57:49] that he was in a theophany again his
[57:51] soul was down there with those people
[57:53] that were in the oppan he's also and was
[57:56] witnessing to them that they repented
[57:59] not in the long-suffering now remember
[58:02] when he go to hell for he went to hell -
[58:04] what show those people what all those
[58:09] Old Testament Saints
[58:10] I'm Old Testament prophets and before
[58:12] the flood he said I'm the one that
[58:16] Noah preached about I'm standing here in
[58:20] human and it's not human flesh but I'm
[58:22] standing here in my theophany I'm
[58:23] standing here telling you that you
[58:26] should have listened to Noah I came down
[58:29] in Noah and spoke to you and you in in
[58:33] other words you didn't reject Noah you
[58:36] rejected me I have eternal life but
[58:40] since you rejected me I'm taking that
[58:42] eternal life back with me while he'll
[58:46] can't be eternal
[58:47] you can't put an eternal person in hell
[58:50] you can't put an eternal theophany in
[58:53] hell
[58:53] and then Jesus left that place memory
[58:57] came back up went to Paradise picked all
[59:00] them people up amen
[59:02] he had a job to do but he was fulfilling
[59:05] the promise of Isaiah that said he'll
[59:09] give his soul a ransom so that he could
[59:12] one see his seed well I'm not the seed
[59:16] of Charles and Ella Branham I'm a seed
[59:20] of my mom and daddy if you're born again
[59:23] you're not the seed of your mom and
[59:24] daddy you're the seed of Almighty God
[59:26] amen and that's what he went to hell for
[59:29] is that he gave his soul a ransom so he
[59:32] could see his seed or see his progeny
[59:35] are see his genetics come forth and be
[59:39] something as real listen to me as real
[59:43] as he is you see we're not as real as
[59:47] God is I'm not looking at the real part
[59:50] I'm looking at a shadow I'm looking at a
[59:52] negative I'm looking at the first life
[59:55] I'll read something to you in a minute
[59:58] but acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them
[1:00:01] repent we haven't read the scripture
[1:00:03] ever before repent and be baptized every
[1:00:06] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:08] for the remission of sins and you shall
[1:00:11] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:00:14] the promise there's the promise for the
[1:00:17] promise is unto you what is the promised
[1:00:20] eternal life in your soul
[1:00:25] eternal life back the way it should have
[1:00:27] been had there not been a fall than
[1:00:30] alright for the promises them to you and
[1:00:33] to your children to all that are afar
[1:00:34] off even as me and the Lord our God
[1:00:36] shall call now let's go to Hebrews 11
[1:00:40] verse 37 all the great warriors our
[1:00:45] faith all in Hebrews 11 they were stolen
[1:00:47] they were sawn asunder here Paul is
[1:00:49] bringing it all together we know all the
[1:00:51] names Moses Noah we know all the names
[1:00:55] they were stoned they were sawn asunder
[1:00:57] that was Isaiah remember tempted slain
[1:01:01] to us with a sword they wandered about
[1:01:03] in sheepskins and goatskins being
[1:01:05] destitute afflicted tormented and I like
[1:01:07] when this is a good interpolation of
[1:01:10] whom the world was not worthy they
[1:01:15] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:01:17] in dens and caves of the earth and these
[1:01:19] all having obtained a good report
[1:01:22] through faith received not the promise
[1:01:28] that to me is this plain is what I'm
[1:01:31] tell you two plus two for God having
[1:01:37] provided some better thing some new
[1:01:41] Testament for us that all right that
[1:01:46] they without us should not be made
[1:01:49] perfect and then you're born again today
[1:01:54] you're perfect if you're not then you
[1:01:59] need to get morning in Hebrews 10 verse
[1:02:02] 1 for the law having a shadow of good
[1:02:04] things to come and not the very image of
[1:02:06] the thing look the law was a shadow of
[1:02:08] good things to come and not the very
[1:02:11] image of the thing Jesus Christ was the
[1:02:14] image that they were looking for all
[1:02:17] those Old Testament prophets were
[1:02:18] looking for the Messiah because they
[1:02:21] knew that Messiah would be gone he would
[1:02:23] come down in human flesh and in other
[1:02:25] words he would save Israel not all right
[1:02:29] because that was your customer can never
[1:02:34] can never with those sacrifices
[1:02:38] Isis which they offered year by year
[1:02:39] continually make the comers thereunto
[1:02:43] perfect for then would they not have
[1:02:46] seems to be offered because that the
[1:02:49] worshipper once purged the worshipper
[1:02:55] once purged should have had no more
[1:02:58] conscious of sins but in those
[1:03:02] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[1:03:05] made of sin every year those people knew
[1:03:08] the date they knew when that high priest
[1:03:11] was going to get ready they knew when
[1:03:13] they did that sect one sacrifice to get
[1:03:16] the one bullet to get the blood to go in
[1:03:18] the Holy of Holies they knew that and
[1:03:19] you know why that they knew that number
[1:03:23] one it was proclaimed everywhere but
[1:03:25] number two it was their sins they were
[1:03:27] dependent on him to go in there to take
[1:03:28] care of a man but it was every year
[1:03:31] that's our problem we bring up like I
[1:03:34] did we bring up our sins every few
[1:03:36] minutes and God said I don't want to
[1:03:37] send you talking about but in those
[1:03:41] sacrifices there they resemble
[1:03:43] remembrance again made of sin every year
[1:03:44] for it it's not possible that the blood
[1:03:47] of bulls and goats should take away sin
[1:03:51] and then wherefore when he comes into
[1:03:53] the world he says sacrifice and
[1:03:55] offerings out what is not but a body has
[1:03:57] now prepared for me in burnt offerings
[1:04:01] and sacrifices for sin thou has had no
[1:04:04] pleasure that was a that was a
[1:04:08] permissive will of God that that would
[1:04:11] even happen
[1:04:12] and then in burnt offerings and
[1:04:14] sacrifices for sin thou has had no
[1:04:17] pleasure then said i lo i coming the
[1:04:20] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:04:21] to do thy will of god above when he has
[1:04:25] said sacrifice and offerings and burnt
[1:04:26] offerings and offering raise it up for
[1:04:29] sin thou wouldest not neither has
[1:04:30] pleasure therein which are offered by
[1:04:32] the law
[1:04:34] now watch then said he lo I come to do
[1:04:37] thy will O God he taketh away the first
[1:04:42] that he may establish the second what he
[1:04:46] takes away doesn't do away with the Old
[1:04:48] Testament listen we're not doing away
[1:04:50] with the Old Testament
[1:04:51] we have to have it because I'm an put it
[1:04:56] in here may not but remember it
[1:04:57] somewhere in Corinthians I think Paul
[1:04:59] said those are all done for example
[1:05:02] whose the ends of the world come - which
[1:05:04] is us all right he takes it away the
[1:05:06] first that he may establish the second
[1:05:09] by the which will by the which will we
[1:05:13] are sanctified through the offering of
[1:05:15] the body of Jesus Christ once for all
[1:05:17] and every priest and of daily
[1:05:21] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[1:05:22] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:05:27] away sins but this man after he had
[1:05:32] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:05:35] sit down on the right hand of God from
[1:05:38] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[1:05:40] made his footstool look far by one
[1:05:43] offering he has perfected forever them
[1:05:46] that are sanctified we're of the Holy
[1:05:52] Ghost
[1:05:52] also is a witness to us for after that
[1:05:56] it said before this is the Covenant that
[1:05:59] I will make with them after those days
[1:06:01] saith the Lord I will put my laws into
[1:06:03] their heart heart and in their minds
[1:06:07] will I write them and their sins now
[1:06:09] this is written this is the Old
[1:06:10] Testament scripture this is quoting from
[1:06:13] the Old Testament if I had my well I got
[1:06:15] my Scofield but we'll look it up later
[1:06:17] but this is an Old Testament scripture
[1:06:19] and their sins and their iniquities will
[1:06:21] I remember no more right the problem
[1:06:26] with the Old Testament they just kept it
[1:06:29] just like a rollercoaster I just kept
[1:06:34] sins were just pushed back people could
[1:06:37] still remember them but not anymore
[1:06:40] or by one offering he has perfected
[1:06:42] forever them that are sanctified all
[1:06:46] right done all right say ma'am a man now
[1:06:48] look when at the apne was made flashing
[1:06:53] Jesus Christ he was the only person that
[1:06:57] everything could be involved with he was
[1:07:00] the only one it could be the fullness of
[1:07:01] the Godhead bodily there's no one else
[1:07:04] can do that
[1:07:05] he was the only one now we can be apart
[1:07:07] and being apart is great but he was the
[1:07:11] whole we're not saviors he's savior a
[1:07:14] man but yet through us through life he
[1:07:19] can save people I say we could I said
[1:07:24] but through us through us wide in the
[1:07:28] Ethiopian eunuch need of Philip he was
[1:07:35] stuck in the Old Testament he was
[1:07:39] reading the scrolls and he said I need
[1:07:42] somebody to explain this to me so God
[1:07:45] sends what a piece of itself that had
[1:07:49] the mind of Christ he sent a piece of
[1:07:51] himself down to to the Ethiopian unit
[1:07:54] you know what he didn't have to set in
[1:07:55] the message church for 10 years Philip
[1:08:02] sat there and explained it to him and
[1:08:04] the Ethiopian eunuch didn't look and go
[1:08:07] well my my pastor don't believe the hell
[1:08:10] where'd you get that quote no you know
[1:08:13] what he said he said words of water
[1:08:16] where's water if this is what you're
[1:08:20] talking about it and I'm sure Philip
[1:08:22] didn't just sit there and go well now
[1:08:24] that man he I think he died and I think
[1:08:30] he came back and I think no I believe
[1:08:34] Philip was very positive Philip said
[1:08:37] this man who you see in this Old
[1:08:39] Testament he has been here in flesh and
[1:08:41] he did exactly what he said he's going
[1:08:44] to do and this man named Peter if you
[1:08:47] want to go talk to him he may preach the
[1:08:49] good sermon just a few weeks ago and he
[1:08:51] said repent and be baptized in the name
[1:08:54] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:08:55] your sins and you shall receive this
[1:08:57] gift if this man talking about and I'm
[1:09:00] sure the eunuch said where's the water
[1:09:03] what hinders you in other words in other
[1:09:05] words well I think he was walking toward
[1:09:07] the water and Phil it was probably still
[1:09:09] standing up on the shore
[1:09:10] bill it was my whole wait a minute
[1:09:12] what's going on here
[1:09:14] I'm getting I'm getting persecuted by
[1:09:17] the religious world and here's an
[1:09:20] Ethiopian eunuch you don't know what
[1:09:22] that is
[1:09:23] a man that is sterile because of what he
[1:09:28] does things in the palace all right so
[1:09:30] here's this guy and he looks just so
[1:09:32] common and filling the plate man you you
[1:09:37] got to have it we got it in the ethiop
[1:09:42] unison what if you've done enough
[1:09:46] talking I know what I got to do yeah
[1:09:49] wish that's the way we would do instead
[1:09:50] of what what do we do we go when I wait
[1:09:53] I don't know my preacher didn't preset
[1:09:56] that way no the Ethiopian eunuch God
[1:09:59] showed him something but he showed him
[1:10:01] something through Philip a man he showed
[1:10:05] him Philips a zeal to the he showed the
[1:10:09] zeal through the truth Philip to the
[1:10:11] Ethiopian eunuch and the Ethiopian unit
[1:10:13] was pricked in his heart just like the
[1:10:15] people under their Pentecost was pricked
[1:10:17] in their heart like the 3000 he was one
[1:10:20] man and he got pricked in his heart and
[1:10:22] he says what must we do well I reckon
[1:10:25] Philip had already told him about the
[1:10:27] water fill and the beauty of unasyn of
[1:10:29] words water what hinders us got off that
[1:10:33] chariot and hit the water but he did it
[1:10:37] through somebody and that's exactly the
[1:10:42] way he's working now through his
[1:10:45] children he's working through the ones
[1:10:48] that he gave why in the world would God
[1:10:51] give us a promise and then renege on it
[1:10:54] why would he give us a promise and not
[1:10:56] fulfill it amen
[1:10:58] he's going to fulfill it that great
[1:11:01] theophany of God which to me is the Holy
[1:11:04] Ghost amen
[1:11:05] that's the Holy Ghost in your soul
[1:11:08] because if you don't have the theophany
[1:11:10] of God in you
[1:11:11] what are you you're not born again
[1:11:15] you're born from down here you've got to
[1:11:19] be born from wait a minute
[1:11:26] those that don't know I'm getting I'm
[1:11:29] trying to quit pointing upward yeah
[1:11:33] that's true at a slant so let's do this
[1:11:36] at a slant but remember if you have the
[1:11:40] Holy Ghost in your soul he's right here
[1:11:41] he's not over there somewhere

[1:13:48] that's not man man can't do that Satan's
[1:13:51] you're not gonna do it he's gonna be
[1:13:52] back there going who you think you are
[1:13:54] yes
[1:13:56] there's no seniority in this thing no no
[1:14:00] no there is no seniority brother Brown
[1:14:02] said get them under the waterspout get
[1:14:05] them wet and let's see what happens hey
[1:14:08] man so we get them under the waterspout
[1:14:09] the great fountain of all eternity was
[1:14:12] that spirit of love joy that spirit of
[1:14:13] honesty that spirit of trueness in his
[1:14:15] perfection and now the existence of the
[1:14:18] father went to low Gotham don't get into
[1:14:19] something here which was the Sun which
[1:14:22] was the theophany that's weed uncovered
[1:14:24] this couple weeks ago which was the body
[1:14:26] of the great Jehovah God went forth in a
[1:14:28] celestial body that's the logos the word
[1:14:31] spoke out of them great fountains of
[1:14:33] life and went forth and there was the
[1:14:35] theophany which was God made into word
[1:14:38] we've been through this you should have
[1:14:40] that down pretty pretty well then that
[1:14:43] the oppinion was made flesh in the
[1:14:45] person Christ Jesus and then all the
[1:14:48] fullness of the Trinity dwelt in him
[1:14:50] both Father Son and Holy Ghost all in
[1:14:52] that and that's the very way we go plumb
[1:14:57] back to the original beginning of God
[1:15:01] hope God don't have a beginning brother
[1:15:03] it's mine and your understanding not his
[1:15:08] he never had a beginning but there was a
[1:15:11] time when we began to understand God
[1:15:15] listen even when you get the new birth
[1:15:17] you don't understand God all the way you
[1:15:20] should why because you got that other
[1:15:22] life you got that you got that carnal
[1:15:25] mind beating on that what beating on
[1:15:28] that person look go plumb back to the
[1:15:31] original beginning of God there we are
[1:15:34] born again not a flesh born again not of
[1:15:38] blood he's gone about the first birth
[1:15:39] but born again by the spirit and in that
[1:15:44] eternal spirit of love and honor
[1:15:46] he comes down to make its place in us so
[1:15:51] don't think that we have something
[1:15:52] waiting for us sure there's a fullness
[1:15:56] that is waiting for us okay that's all
[1:15:59] right but if you don't have a part here
[1:16:01] to connect to there you're not going
[1:16:04] there right and when we die from this
[1:16:09] life we go into the body which if this
[1:16:12] earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have
[1:16:13] a theophany to go into a body celestial
[1:16:17] now listen there's not a body hanging up
[1:16:19] here like this waiting on us today or
[1:16:21] waiting on this to get changed no I
[1:16:23] thought he just said he was going to be
[1:16:24] in you
[1:16:25] okay so let's not confuse this then it's
[1:16:28] a coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:29] this body is picked from the earth again
[1:16:32] this body and made in a glorified state
[1:16:36] to live in his presence forever then all
[1:16:39] the perversion all the things that's in
[1:16:41] the perversion all goes out of existence
[1:16:44] all right now look he talked about evil
[1:16:48] people here hell opens up her mouth and
[1:16:50] swallows and all the evil and the
[1:16:52] perversion and God in his beloved church
[1:16:54] his bride takes their stand for the
[1:16:56] eternity to roll on that's the great
[1:16:58] hope of the Christian Church a man so
[1:17:02] that the often is what comes back to get
[1:17:05] you that's what came back on the damned
[1:17:06] Pentecost
[1:17:07] it's not waiting somewhere am i I don't
[1:17:11] want something to wait on me I want to
[1:17:13] hear to take me there to take me into
[1:17:17] another dimension I can't go into
[1:17:18] another dimension six dimension without
[1:17:23] the new birth sure you're going to go
[1:17:25] into a dimension but that first life is
[1:17:27] going to take you into what the fifth
[1:17:29] dimension you don't get born again if
[1:17:32] you just have that first life and you
[1:17:33] just live your life and you still got
[1:17:35] that old carnal mind that Adamic nature
[1:17:37] you're going to go in and going to hell
[1:17:39] I'll let you get unless you get eternal
[1:17:42] life for being good to somebody or
[1:17:43] something but you people sitting here
[1:17:44] today they there's not a lot of gray
[1:17:46] area for us sitting here and man we're
[1:17:49] either going up or down you know too
[1:17:53] much you can't plead ignorance and then
[1:17:57] that's why I said it's a lovely place
[1:18:00] but you know what Jacob said he said the
[1:18:01] house of God is a dreadful place
[1:18:04] remember he went to Beth Ellen he saw
[1:18:08] the angels he said this is the house of
[1:18:09] God it is a dreadful place all right now
[1:18:13] let's read this let's go to number six
[1:18:17] and read it real quick I pasted my 45
[1:18:26] piece live I'm sorry only by about 10
[1:18:28] minutes so anyway let's read the what's
[1:18:32] going going up that life that begin not
[1:18:40] nothing along here but all the way up
[1:18:43] there eternal life Zoli God's own life
[1:18:45] comes down and dwells in the man and he
[1:18:47] is eternal with God and can't die that's
[1:18:50] what the word said I just think of it is
[1:18:53] there to eternal life I answer no you
[1:18:56] answer no you couldn't answer that could
[1:18:59] you there is one eternal life and that's
[1:19:02] the life of God this kind of life no
[1:19:06] matter what it is it's got an end to it
[1:19:09] listen pulse it to life I now live in
[1:19:12] other words my old life is d-a-d dead
[1:19:17] not divorced that's our problem we come
[1:19:21] - let me just tell you this we come to a
[1:19:23] state of sanctification
[1:19:24] nothing's dead yet it's dying dying but
[1:19:30] it's not dead because remember the
[1:19:32] unclean spirit goes out he's not dead he
[1:19:35] just goes somewhere else he comes back
[1:19:39] he's still life but he brings several
[1:19:42] more of his buddies and the state of the
[1:19:45] person but let me tell you something you
[1:19:46] drive him out and let God kill him by
[1:19:48] the word there's nothing to come back
[1:19:51] except God himself a man just think of
[1:19:54] it is there to eternal life you couldn't
[1:19:56] answer that could you
[1:19:57] there is one eternal life and that's the
[1:19:59] life of God this other kind of life no
[1:20:01] matter what it is it's gotten into it
[1:20:04] and anything that had a beginning has an
[1:20:06] end but anything that has no beginning
[1:20:09] has no end and God said he would give us
[1:20:14] eternal life without beginning we were
[1:20:17] just made a part of him and actually the
[1:20:21] life that thin us wasn't brought here by
[1:20:23] human nature nature give us a spirit but
[1:20:28] that spirit are the first life died that
[1:20:32] all right can say that without with a
[1:20:36] little interpolation we get the Spirit
[1:20:39] of God glory to God amen but I watch
[1:20:44] let's get way on over guys to number
[1:20:49] eight let's go to number eight because I
[1:20:57] want to get to something right here
[1:21:06] got it all right when God was Wednesday
[1:21:09] often when God was in theophany which
[1:21:11] was Christ in the making then that
[1:21:13] theophany became flesh and dwelt among
[1:21:15] us then that was to redeem he came from
[1:21:18] there down through this to redeem this
[1:21:21] creature give it life take it back up
[1:21:24] into the eternal one see there's only
[1:21:27] one eternal life and it lays in God
[1:21:29] alone and God only has eternal life and
[1:21:31] we have been privileged to become the
[1:21:33] sons of God then that word he that
[1:21:36] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:21:38] that sent me hath eternal life the greek
[1:21:40] word zoe they are used for god's own
[1:21:42] life the creature that accepts him
[1:21:45] becomes a part of god and is just as
[1:21:47] eternal as god it that's right there's
[1:21:49] no reason for us to doubt it it's God's
[1:21:53] everlasting eternal word and everything
[1:21:55] that had a beginning had an end so where
[1:21:58] did where did sin begin sin begin at the
[1:22:01] Garden of Eden and sin has an end so
[1:22:04] David cried o Lord my God my soul is
[1:22:05] thirsty for then and dry land where no
[1:22:07] water is without loving-kindness is
[1:22:09] better than life there must be two
[1:22:13] different types of life and there is two
[1:22:16] types of life and when a man is born
[1:22:19] into this world he's nothing but a
[1:22:20] product of sin when he's born because
[1:22:23] he's from sexual desire and he's just a
[1:22:26] product of sin the Bible says he is he's
[1:22:28] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:22:30] the world speaking Eliezer
[1:22:31] and yet he's got life but that life is
[1:22:35] perverted life that light was that life
[1:22:38] was Satan cannot create life to look
[1:22:41] even though it was Adolf Hitler even
[1:22:44] though it was you get the worst person
[1:22:46] God had to give that person life Satan
[1:22:51] cannot create a lot cannot give anybody
[1:22:53] life listen dog gets lost all the
[1:22:56] animals that's God's life it just
[1:23:00] doesn't have a soul put in it than all
[1:23:03] right that's right okay but he put it in
[1:23:05] us to make a choice Satan cannot create
[1:23:10] life
[1:23:10] he can only pervert what God has created
[1:23:15] Satan has no way there's only one
[1:23:18] creator
[1:23:19] God didn't talk about Satan can't heal
[1:23:21] and all the things now we see the
[1:23:22] different types of life that's the
[1:23:24] reason that this man is born as a
[1:23:26] product of Adam which were a product of
[1:23:28] sin from listening to his wife and the
[1:23:32] wife would the products of sin comes
[1:23:34] from Satan and Adam followed his wife
[1:23:36] out a perfect type of Christ going with
[1:23:39] his the bride to take her sins as item
[1:23:43] took the sins to be even left the Garden
[1:23:44] of Eden not deceived but willingly
[1:23:47] walked out with her soulless Christ not
[1:23:49] deceived
[1:23:50] Satan could not deceive him if thou be
[1:23:53] the Son of God he knew that he was but
[1:23:55] he deliberately walked out into sin for
[1:23:58] the church he's our sin bear and now
[1:24:01] everything that come out of that cycle
[1:24:03] of eternal life when that goes back into
[1:24:05] its cycle again it's that ceaseless
[1:24:08] eternity not one shape form of sin in
[1:24:12] any way will ever enter now here's one
[1:24:15] Baptist preacher believing holding
[1:24:16] notice that has got to be cleanse that
[1:24:20] person has got to be cleanse and there's
[1:24:22] only one thing can cleanse them that's
[1:24:24] the blood of Jesus Christ nothing else
[1:24:26] can do it
[1:24:27] that's the life we're looking for we
[1:24:30] have to live in life we do we still have
[1:24:33] a carnal mind because remember the
[1:24:34] greatest battle ever fought is in your
[1:24:37] mind even after you're born again listen
[1:24:41] I didn't have to fight so much when I
[1:24:42] was a sinner why just what were you
[1:24:44] fighting if you want to say a bad word
[1:24:50] when did you fight saying it no you just
[1:24:52] said it you didn't have to fight and go
[1:24:55] to liquor store that's what you did
[1:24:58] right but when we got the new life that
[1:25:05] killed that old life and you better on
[1:25:09] go back to the liquor store again unless
[1:25:12] you get some cough medicine maybe
[1:25:15] alright anyway get away from that one
[1:25:21] listen now what's going to happen is
[1:25:25] what's going to happen is we want to see
[1:25:28] now that this family that God is
[1:25:31] developed we know we have
[1:25:34] turn alive but now I want to something
[1:25:37] that we want to read here and let's go
[1:25:40] all the way guys over to number 11
[1:25:43] that'll save time we'll read these two
[1:25:46] and then we'll be finished number 11 I
[1:25:49] mean number 10 sorry 10 10 there you go
[1:25:53] what do we do because watch now we
[1:25:58] brought you here with the new birth now
[1:26:01] I'm going to take you back remember I've
[1:26:05] always said that the seals sure it's a
[1:26:08] revealing of Jesus Christ it run around
[1:26:12] many times in the seal book he said the
[1:26:14] seals breaking shows what what that
[1:26:16] which was which is and what used to come
[1:26:20] in other words where you came from what
[1:26:22] you're doing here and where you're going
[1:26:23] now if I know that a man I use the GPS
[1:26:30] it's called God's predestinated seed it
[1:26:35] will get there I promise you with no
[1:26:38] error that will be not a recalculating
[1:26:42] in God's predestinated seed that GPS
[1:26:45] will land right where it supposed to
[1:26:47] land a man done all right
[1:26:49] I like brother and listen I'm telling
[1:26:51] you that's brother Joseph is good - let
[1:26:53] me get brother Joseph arose I got one
[1:26:55] morning amen
[1:27:00] don't you listen this is what we were
[1:27:02] talking about and he come up with
[1:27:03] something that was really neat I'm going
[1:27:05] to use it brother Joe's all right I
[1:27:06] can't see him slum we'll use it anyway
[1:27:10] brother Tim Jim's we were talking about
[1:27:12] you know relationship well remember Adam
[1:27:15] didn't lose his relationship with God he
[1:27:18] was the son of God when I'm a
[1:27:20] relationship if men my first cousin
[1:27:22] we're a relation because what we're
[1:27:24] family now you can't ever take that away
[1:27:26] you can't take that relationship but
[1:27:29] they lost fellowship and then brother
[1:27:32] Joe said what we need is revelation ship
[1:27:36] revelation ship to get us back to what
[1:27:39] fellowship we're not gonna lose our
[1:27:42] relationship it's always there
[1:27:44] remember that's what that's what that
[1:27:47] quote was I
[1:27:47] don't stay at them but I think God
[1:27:49] wanted me to say it now because when he
[1:27:51] said what did Jesus did he bring your
[1:27:52] inheritance no no your inheritance was
[1:27:55] before the foundation of the world your
[1:27:57] relationship never had a beginning or
[1:28:00] never had an end now that's in the mind
[1:28:02] of God but when you drop down to this
[1:28:04] other life yeah you've got to walk
[1:28:07] through sin but listen if you weren't in
[1:28:10] his mind in the eternal section you're
[1:28:12] not going to do it down here hey man I
[1:28:16] know as well as you do I don't believe
[1:28:18] it we came with any kind of eternal life
[1:28:19] in us the things I did when I was a
[1:28:22] sinner God wouldn't know we're in
[1:28:25] because God won't dwell in an unclean
[1:28:27] vessel but I had representation that one
[1:28:30] day somebody would quote the right quote
[1:28:33] or somebody would read the right
[1:28:36] scripture and it was what bark like
[1:28:40] lightning what the revelation ship takes
[1:28:44] me back to fellowship Joe I'm gonna use
[1:28:47] that not if it's copyrighted I'll pay
[1:28:48] you later
[1:28:49] huh but I think that was great because
[1:28:52] what brings us back to fellowship
[1:28:55] revelation shift how can to agree how
[1:28:58] can do what without a grant you really I
[1:29:01] mean come on people you can you can
[1:29:03] fellowship with somebody but if you
[1:29:05] don't have any common interest with each
[1:29:06] other it's going to be a real short
[1:29:08] fellowship amen but we're supposed to
[1:29:11] have a fellowship with God for an
[1:29:12] eternity so we must better be pretty
[1:29:14] close and have something to talk about
[1:29:16] with our Savior amen
[1:29:19] now look in building this family watch
[1:29:25] number 11 questions an answer what do we
[1:29:30] do well my dear brother st. hey brother
[1:29:31] my dear st. his sister before the
[1:29:33] foundation of the world when God created

[1:29:39] His image and created the woman in the
[1:29:41] image of the man for the glory of the
[1:29:42] man he made you a theophany just like
[1:29:45] himself his self when he said led us to
[1:29:49] the creatures that he had made let us
[1:29:51] make men our own image in our likeness a
[1:29:53] theophany God had never become flesh yet

[1:31:13] it must be right I'm being mean sorry
[1:31:20] and this spirit who was occupied so much
[1:31:25] gases let's read that I want to read
[1:31:27] that that's good
[1:31:28] let's go back down son now look you take
[1:31:31] a cell you break it down from a cell and
[1:31:33] it comes in then to a cell and a cell
[1:31:35] into an atom and molecule and on down
[1:31:37] like that it finally it ends up into the
[1:31:39] unseen it goes from a natural something
[1:31:42] you put your hands on two gases from
[1:31:44] gases to acids acids in the gases gases
[1:31:47] on back like that till it finally all
[1:31:50] winds up to one little thing and that is
[1:31:53] spirit
[1:31:55] we had a spiritual Einstein that can
[1:31:57] that could say that mmm and this spirit
[1:32:02] who has occupied these gases it might
[1:32:06] not be the same gases but the features
[1:32:09] of what you are will be exactly what
[1:32:12] they are again see the spear
[1:32:14] it has controlled that now look if you
[1:32:16] don't have that Genesis 1:26 man inside
[1:32:19] of you how in the world is Doug going to
[1:32:21] know what you look like you saw God
[1:32:23] knows everything sure he does but he
[1:32:24] don't keep up with the Devils kids
[1:32:26] because they are getting older and older
[1:32:28] and older and I just read you a quote
[1:32:30] last Sunday where there theophany what
[1:32:31] they were old when they were down in
[1:32:32] hell amen hey listen I want to use this
[1:32:36] lose I don't say God doesn't care but he
[1:32:38] really doesn't care about the Devils
[1:32:40] kids they made a choice so in the
[1:32:43] judgement of the choice he had to reject
[1:32:46] them wasn't his fault it was their fault
[1:32:49] amen I don't think God doesn't care
[1:32:52] about them but really he really don't I
[1:32:54] mean he fought takes you through life he
[1:32:57] follows you through life he's going to
[1:32:59] make sure you get to that image amen and
[1:33:02] this spirit is not going to occupy these
[1:33:04] gases the spirit has controlled that and
[1:33:07] now in other words when you become a
[1:33:09] young man or a young woman and like God
[1:33:11] takes a picture of you no matter how old
[1:33:14] and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it
[1:33:16] will be that will wind right on down
[1:33:18] through and that body may be destroyed
[1:33:21] disfigured burnt eat up by lines
[1:33:23] whatever it is but it was made up of
[1:33:25] gases 16 elements of the earth that was
[1:33:27] calcium potash petroleum cosmic light
[1:33:29] and so forth all goes together to make
[1:33:32] up the body now no matter that the whole
[1:33:34] earth is filled with that all right now
[1:33:36] paragraph 21 now look
[1:33:38] but now roll it up but now this picture
[1:33:42] is the main thing then in the
[1:33:45] resurrection those gases and acids and
[1:33:48] things come right back into the place
[1:33:50] and develops this picture again now this
[1:33:53] picture was not taken when you were 16
[1:33:56] or 18 or 20 years old at your bath down
[1:34:00] here first life because like I said
[1:34:04] before how many of you were not even the
[1:34:05] message of 20 years old girls who had
[1:34:07] short hair this when I had earrings now
[1:34:09] the way God's going to see you in the
[1:34:11] eternity no I don't think now this
[1:34:13] picture was taken what let us make man
[1:34:17] in our own image because listen when
[1:34:20] that second life comes in to you it's a
[1:34:24] new birth what does it do
[1:34:25] it turns you back into that image your
[1:34:29] hair is long sisters you know where
[1:34:30] earrings guys we don't wear alone hair
[1:34:32] what it's taking our body back into that
[1:34:36] image to match what's inside of us well
[1:34:39] that thrilled my soul when was it taken
[1:34:42] before there was a foundation of the
[1:34:45] world
[1:34:47] when the morning stars sang together
[1:34:50] and the sons of God shouted for joy God
[1:34:53] saw you there hear not as people before
[1:34:59] there was a foundation of the world it
[1:35:01] was putting God's great file and then
[1:35:04] only thing it did was feature itself
[1:35:06] here for you to make your choice then
[1:35:11] become see then become a servant of God
[1:35:13] him for knowing it makes them a redeemer
[1:35:15] as we've been through it then that
[1:35:17] picture is absolutely this is the
[1:35:19] negative the negative part of life is
[1:35:23] where you're living now and anything if
[1:35:26] there is a negative there's got to be a
[1:35:27] positive before there can be a negative
[1:35:33] before there can be a negative there had
[1:35:35] to be a positive the gods forgot to
[1:35:37] start with therefore if this is a
[1:35:39] negative there's got to be a positive
[1:35:42] somewhere and this ain't the real thing
[1:35:45] I like southern prophets and this hates
[1:35:48] the real thing this is only a foreshadow
[1:35:50] of the real theme that is to come now
[1:35:53] you get it I don't care what they do
[1:35:55] with you they cannot destroy that
[1:35:58] profile that picture in God's great
[1:36:01] gallery up there it cannot destroy it
[1:36:04] it's in heaven you can burn it Fiat the
[1:36:07] lines do whatever you want to but
[1:36:09] remember that what brother I was talking
[1:36:12] about revelations 13 when your name was
[1:36:16] put in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:36:17] the foundation world it wasn't just a
[1:36:18] name that was a face went with that name
[1:36:21] and that was at 18 20 years old that's
[1:36:23] your best not down here but already in
[1:36:27] God's mind because like I said listen to
[1:36:29] me when you got born again it turns you
[1:36:32] from that that first life took you into
[1:36:36] that but thank God Almighty that knew
[1:36:39] taking turns you in your whole your
[1:36:42] whole being turns back to that how do
[1:36:45] you think we're going how you think
[1:36:48] we'll have a body change we gonna change
[1:36:51] from old old we're gonna change from new
[1:36:57] top no we're going to change from old to
[1:37:02] that image right then
[1:37:03] and to me that is in his eternal section
[1:37:08] he's got pictures let's notice it
[1:37:12] prettier that's about 55 but anyway God
[1:37:18] takes him out of once and while I
[1:37:19] believe he just kind of looks too easy
[1:37:21] well we'll develop that in just a little
[1:37:24] while well they're getting closer so
[1:37:28] we're going to develop that one in just
[1:37:29] a little while and man
[1:37:31] because in God's mind remembers already
[1:37:32] finished done over settled you never did
[1:37:36] get old you never send a day in your
[1:37:38] life you came from the great eternal to
[1:37:43] what the display his attributes here on
[1:37:45] earth but I'll guarantee you one thing
[1:37:47] if you were in that book that profile
[1:37:51] cannot be destroyed because it's the
[1:37:54] Word of God that word of God is what
[1:37:57] made that image hey man that word of God
[1:38:02] is what made that image and when he said
[1:38:04] let us make man in our own image boom
[1:38:07] there it is all these children he'll
[1:38:10] ever have he has a hole and let us make
[1:38:14] man in our image why there was an image
[1:38:16] what it was all of us created in His
[1:38:21] image amen
[1:38:24] you loved the Lord all your to love God
[1:38:27] more than ever he has preserved you
[1:38:29] he has took you from nothing and made
[1:38:33] you something you think I'm
[1:38:34] insignificant that's your problem if
[1:38:37] you're born again you're just as
[1:38:39] powerful as God it
[1:38:41] I believe that there's got to be a time
[1:38:44] when we go well I don't know but I'll
[1:38:50] just what did I business there's only
[1:38:54] one I am and he said I am that I am so
[1:39:00] that's the one we need to look at you
[1:39:03] know what when Moses went to Egypt like
[1:39:06] girls always said when Moses went to
[1:39:10] Egypt Pharaoh said hey who's going to
[1:39:13] deliver these people you want you know
[1:39:16] you got an errand there and you can't
[1:39:17] even talk yourself I can't listen here
[1:39:19] you can't stand here he told Moses he
[1:39:23] said who's on deliverance because Moses
[1:39:24] I am I am took them people out of Egypt
[1:39:29] but he used a human man and for you and
[1:39:33] I musicians come for you and I to get
[1:39:35] out of here we're gonna have to realize
[1:39:38] that God is using you and I he's using
[1:39:42] his bride to fulfill what he saw before
[1:39:46] the foundation of the world amen
[1:39:48] now remember some of us has already went
[1:39:51] past at 18 to 20 years old so I've got
[1:39:54] to depend on the memory of God to
[1:39:57] remember what I look like and you know
[1:40:00] what that kid's business brother Louise
[1:40:02] that's his business
[1:40:04] that's what he promised he would do he
[1:40:08] made the promise we make a promise that
[1:40:10] when half the time we do it half time we
[1:40:13] don't amen
[1:40:14] I'll guarantee if God makes a promise
[1:40:15] he'll see it all the way to the end
[1:40:18] he'll never leave us he'll never forsake
[1:40:20] us
[1:40:21] he'll never turn us down I was thinking
[1:40:24] the other day you know brother Brian
[1:40:25] said well you know we always say well
[1:40:27] Satan this and Satan did this brother
[1:40:29] Berman said if you're a Christian said
[1:40:31] if you let Satan get to you he said you
[1:40:32] went out to meet him in other words he
[1:40:35] can't get you while you're behind the
[1:40:38] word he can't touch you but when you do
[1:40:42] something wrong or you goof up or you do
[1:40:44] something that's a little bonehead like
[1:40:45] I do
[1:40:46] what you've done is is you walked out
[1:40:48] from behind the Word of God now you
[1:40:50] didn't lose your relationship but you
[1:40:52] lost some fellowship
[1:40:54] by the round said the holy ghost of the
[1:40:56] gentleman he'll go out on the limb
[1:40:57] somewhere and he'll sit down and wait
[1:40:59] what wait for you to repent you didn't
[1:41:02] lose your relationship but you lost a
[1:41:04] little fellowship so by revelation ship
[1:41:06] you realize that he's sitting out there
[1:41:08] and that you need him right back here
[1:41:12] let's stand to our feet God's going to
[1:41:20] have a group of children have children
[1:41:23] he's already got him
[1:41:26] we're finite we didn't know I mean we
[1:41:28] were going to have but God is infinite
[1:41:30] he knew how many kids he was going to
[1:41:31] have there's not an extra one there's
[1:41:34] not an extra seat we got to try to feel
[1:41:36] there's not a like brother branham said
[1:41:39] there's not an extra soul somewhere that
[1:41:41] God's not going to feel no everything is
[1:41:43] perfect and I have to put my dependency
[1:41:47] on that promise that I was talking to
[1:41:49] ruff had that promise that that New
[1:41:51] Testament that testator would come and
[1:41:53] die to give me a new life a New
[1:41:57] Testament what in his blood what can

[1:46:08] these songs you listen to these songs a
[1:46:11] man they're just so inspired but those
[1:46:14] people can be just as lost as lost to be
[1:46:17] but anointing could follow them people
[1:46:19] write a song and brother Brown stood
[1:46:21] there trying to go out and kill
[1:46:22] themselves commit suicide why because
[1:46:24] when anointing left them they do not act
[1:46:25] but you and I is Christian even though
[1:46:29] we do get anointing we do get refilling
[1:46:32] of the Holy Ghost we have a settling
[1:46:34] factor we have a factor that we can go
[1:46:37] back to and it will be it is settled
