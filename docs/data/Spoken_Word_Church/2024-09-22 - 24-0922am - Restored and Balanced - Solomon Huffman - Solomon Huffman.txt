this morning we're certainly happy to be here with you and uh we appreciate brother Wade and the invitation to come amen and uh we're just looking forward to a good time with the Lord anden when I come to church I just come to have church and and uh that ought to be our attitude every single service amen we're not here to play Church we're here to have church we're not here to play games but we're here just to gather around the table and hear what God has for us and uh I believe that the Lord has something uh in store for them that are looking for it so uh we just want to go to the Lord in a word of prayer before we read the scripture we want to invite the author of the word to come uh we know that the prophet taught us he said that any man can read words on a page but it takes the Lord uh to anoint that word and to make it live so uh we want the Lord to do that this morning so let's just bow our heads together Lord we come before your great throne of grace and mercy and Lord we're so honored to be in your house one more time Lord on this side of Eternity and what a blessing it is Lord to gather around Believers of like Precious Faith Lord but Lord people that believe this word with all of their hearts Lord we're not here A bunch of unbelievers but we're here your redeemed Sons and Daughters of God and Lord we just come to you this morning and we welcome you and we feel your presence Lord moving in our midst all already Lord as the songs of Zion have been sung We believe it's created an atmosphere where your presence can be welcome to be here and we pray Lord that you would be the center focal point in this service today Lord may you not be in a corner Lord unrecognized with dirty and unwashed feet but Lord may may you be the Center focus of this meeting here today Lord we give you the control we give you the prance Lord we give you this whole service today Lord we pray that you would speak to our hearts and our lives Lord and and give us the things that we have need of Lord as the Bible would read and tell us to to search our hearts Lord and try us and see if there's any evil way in us and Lord if you find anything take it out Lord I pray that you'd anoint me Lord to to just get out of your way father I have no gift but to surrender to you and Lord it would be one thing for me to be an anointed gospel preacher but I pray that you'd anoint your children here this morning Lord that they would be able to hear the word Lord and receive the word and become the word as they receive it Lord we'll be sure to give you all the glory and all the honor and all the praise it's in the Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray Lord bless us now we ask you amen and amen if you have your Bibles we'll uh go straight into the word of God and uh we want to read in the Book of Revelation the 10th chapter very familiar scripture to us Revelation 10 And1 and we'll also read in the book Book of Mark in the seventh chapter and we just greet you this morning in the name of the Lord and bring you greetings from our pastor brother Josh Bennett and the Saints back home and uh the different Ministry Brother Richard Douglas and uh brother Tim cross wanted to be sure and greet your folks here so we want to do that for them and uh we're just looking forward to what God has in store for us and uh we're just at home amen not not strangers we're all the children of God so uh we don't have a new message to bring don't have a new sermon to bring but uh we're just here to put our shoulder to the will and uh to help you along the way and that's what we want to do and uh I believe that uh the message of the hour has an effect in the heart of the bride and so we just want to do that so let's just read here uh in Revelation 10 and one the Bible says here and I saw a mighty a another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we know that uh the prophet would tell us very plainly that only Christ that could have been it was a mighty angel that come out of heaven and he was clothed with a cloud only Christ that could have been and and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uted their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seill up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets amen now we all see and we all know who that seventh verse is speaking of but I want to draw your attention here uh in the eth verse and the ninth verse and the and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now we know the prophet taught us that John was a type of the bride and so when John is coming unto this Mighty Angel and he's taking that book it it is our type it is our type as the Church of the Living God that we are taking that book and eating it the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book I like an attitude like that don't you give me the little book amen he told him to do it and he said then give it to me amen that's our attitude come to God God you got something for me give it to me you got a blessing for me then give it to me give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings let's read also if you will in The Book of Mark the seventh chapter and we'll read the sixth verse down to the 9th Jesus speaking here to the pH uh pH es he gives a very strong rebuke unto them and he says he answered said unto them well hath Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites amen could you imagine somebody talking to you like that Hypocrites as it is written there people they honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me amen you could preach about church members there for a long time amen they worship good and they they do this good but their heart is far from how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men notice what Jesus is saying they're teaching for Doctrine not the word of God but they're teaching for Doctrine the Commandment of man for laying aside the Commandment of God in other words laying aside the word of God ye hold onto tradition of man as the washing of pots and cups and many other like things you do and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition amen we just ask that God would help us and bless the reading of his word as you can be seated and I want to speak to you on the subject of restored and balanced amen restored and balanced how many wants to be a balanced church amen not not here leaning to the left or leaning to the right but we want to be balanced Amen in everything that we say and do we we want our song service to be balanced we want our worship to be balanced we want uh uh the word to be preached in a balanced manner we don't want to be to the left or to the right and and brother Brandon would tell us he said amen that where we're on a oneway street and and you always want to be in the middle of that road you don't want to be to the left and you don't want to be to the right you want to be in the middle and and you remember when the uh the man came to brother Bram said well brother Bram if you're in the middle of the road you're going to get hit and he said no you're not going to get here in the middle of this road because this is a one-way road that we're on and we want to be in the middle of it and you see what the devil wants to do is he wants to push us to the left or push us to the right see what the prophet said he said what the devil will try to do to you and I is that if he can't keep you from believing something he'll push you overboard with what you believe and that's exactly how the devil is going to come against you if he can't make you not believe it then he's going to make you try to get so legalistic and so fanatical over one thing that instead of seeing the whole picture you're just seeing a little small part of it and see amen the prophet taught us that we're to realize the Antichrist Spirit that's working in the framework of the church and then resist that see amen you've got to resist the devil wanting to push you overboard with this or say well this is not important or this is very important amen see God sent us a message to balance us out he sent us a message to restore us and make us a Balan Church and I want to to to to just lay a little foundation in this because we see Jesus here speaking to the Pharisees and he's rebuking them and says you lay aside the word of God and you hold to your tradition of man in other words he's rebuking them because they're making their Traditions more important than the word of God Amen they they they come to Jesus and say well we was pots and we wash pans and before you eat it or before you eat out of this vessel you got to wash and you got to do this and then they get behind their pull pit and preach it and say this is what God wants you to do and this is how God wants his church to be ran and this is how God wants it to be and see Jesus is rebuking them because he says you're you're teaching Doctrine the Commandment of man what you're telling the church to do is not in the scripture what you're telling the children of Israel to do is not in the Bible and Jesus is rebuking them because they're telling the church there so called that it needs to be done this way and you need to conduct it this way and Jesus gives them a very sharp rebuke and says you're a bunch of Hypocrites because you're teaching the doctrine of man as the Commandment of God but it's not right and see amen what Jesus is rebuking as he's telling them that you're putting your your amen your routine or your tradition you're putting it way up here and you're putting God's word here and see that's out of balance brother sister you can have a tradition you can do things the way you want to do it but whenever that contradicts the word of God you better get the tradition out of here because it's going to make the word of God of non effect and that's exactly what Jesus said he said through your Traditions you make the word of God a n effect because you're you're putting your Traditions up here and the word of God is down here and it's lost as effect because you said this is more important than what God's word says is more important amen but may I put my voice with the prophet and say your Traditions they are not more important than the word of God and how you think you ought to do things it is not more important than what God's well you say well well we've been doing it this way for 15 years that don't matter if you've been doing it for 80 years if it contradicts God's word and it don't line up with the word of God you ought to repent and say God I'm throwing away Traditions I'm away what I think about it preacher I tell you what I think I got a better idea than God well I'm glad you're not God Amen listen you don't got a better idea than what God has you don't have a better method than what God has you say well well how does the church need to be ran it is in this Bible well how do we need to preach it is in this Bible what's the position of deacons it is in this Bible and see that's what the Prophet come to point us back to because the church they had Traditions am mean you think about it for a moment because amen our prophet he went into amongst the Pentecostal ranks the Methodist ranks Presbyterian ranks and he's preaching to exactly what Jesus is preaching to a bunch of Pharisees and say well you got to say a man just right you have to do this just right and Jesus has given them the same rebuke or the prophet's giv them the same revie that Jesus is because they're holding on to traditions and saying well this is the way we do it amen you realize sometimes you just got to rub that fur on the cat the wrong way a little bit amen I say God if I'm living wrong I want you to make me uncomfortable if I'm not doing right I want you to make me uncomfortable amen listen I'm not here to be comfortable as we were preaching yesterday amen we're here to be a character filled people that's exactly right we know amen it was the message of the hour that put the church back in order it's exactly right amen the first seal the prophet would tell us he said it's through them seven Thunders that will be revealed in the last days he said why are they revealed in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith not in order to get a a better class of people or to get a nicer group of people but the reason God sent us this message is to get us together for rapturing Faith you say well what are we gathered to you're not gathered to a Ministry you're not gathered to a man you're not gathered to a personality but you're gathered to Christ the revealed word listen I say away with special Ministries away with well anointed ones and lightning and thunder and magic and spectacular listen we ought to be uniting with Christ the word I don't want you to be like me I want you to be like Christ I don't want you to be like your pastor I want you to be like Christ amen and the prophet said I didn't come here to build an organization I didn't come here that you would just follow me and create another clan it's in the end of the church age book and the resume of the ages he's clear on it and the very end of your church age book he said I come here for one thing and that's to see a true established relationship between Christ and the bride amen between man and between God see that's the purpose of this message is to balance us out and to restore us and give the relationship right amen amen we're not here for religion we're here for relationship say we we've had religion for hundreds of years and it ain't done nothing no good amen I don't want religion I want relationship with the God of this Bible hey I've seen what religion produces it produces a Christian on Sunday amen and a good for nothing nobody on Monday that's exactly the truth amen I don't know about you all but I'm not interested in a religion like that I want a religion that gives me a relationship with the god of the Bible that's exactly right amen and that's what this message came to do is to establish a true relationship between man and between God we know very clearly it was under the opening of the word that would actually wake the bride up and it would restore us and it would put us in balance in the third seal you're all very well taught but the prophet said the bride has not had a Revival yet now this is in 1963 and you say but preacher there's been shoutings and there's been movements and there has been amen all the charismatic and healing campaigns and all of this and yet William brandom is saying here in 1963 that the bride has not had a Revival yet he said there's been no Revival there has been no manifestation of God to stir the bride and he says but we're looking for it and it will take them seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up it'll take the seven unknown Thunders to wake her up he said he promised it he'll send it now what amen and that's exactly the truth there's been nothing to Waker as of yet amen you'll find in the church age book The Prophet says now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and two he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contain in the Seven Seals it'll be divinely revealed now the prophet shown you something here because under amen before the opening of the word there has not been a Revival for the bride he says there's been nothing to wake her up as of yet now he's telling you something very clearly here he said to get you to wake up it will take the revelation of the word of God Amen to put a bride in Revival it will take the opening of them Seven Seals it'll take the opening of the word amen and I'm here to announce to you this morning amen we're not waiting for the revelation of the word to come but the revelation of the message of the hour has come and listen friends amen the seals are aome the revelations have been revealed and all you say well where is the bride's Revival you are looking at it this is the bride's Revival he said but where's the shouting and where's the music amen this ain't a Pentecostal Revival it is Revival within the soul of man and our hearts have been turned back to the faith of the apostolic father if you're looking for music and and all of the Pentecostal movement you come to the wrong church amen see the brid's Revival is not an emotional workup see where emotional workups start they'll go down y'all know it's the truth amen you get a church work up with the music that ain't always going to be there but if you get her work amen if you get her Focus put on the word of God I'm telling you right now brother and sister there'll be a Revival in that person heart all they got to do is read one quote and it it sends them off into another Jubilee because the Revival is not based on the church it's not based on the piano but it's based upon the revelation of the word of God listen I don't need a piano to shout I don't need a music to shout I see my name amen written upon the L's Book of Life underneath the revelation of this message amen I tell you what friends we're not a bunch of Pentecostals that are just worked up and emotionally worked up we're worked up but not because of Music we're worked up because of the word that's exactly the truth amen I think it's amazing God sent us a prophet to put the church back in order you believe that amen God sent us a word Prophet I ain't talking about a reformer this ain't a Reformation message it's a restoration message God did not come to reform a church he came to restore a church back to everything that was lost in the Garden of Eden this is a restoration message now either we believe this or we don't believe it and I believe I'm talking to Believers amen underneath the opening of the word it would come back the amen the order of all things amen the prophet taught conduct order and Doctrine did he not amen all of these things are set in order where they need to be it's amazing because brother R would begin to place things back in order and you find people that they start fighting against the move of God and say well if there's a move of God that breaks out in the church y'all get too Pentecostal if you if you get that way or if y'all if y'all shout too loud then then I'm afraid there's going to be too much emotion or there'll be too much of this and you see it's amazing to me because William bradam never took the shout out of the church but then men raise up and say well well we don't need to worship God and we don't need to we don't need to shout Praises To God and we don't need to do this you find men take that out of the church but William brandom never took it out of the church brother sister and then you find it on the other one we're preaching about restore and balance you find people on the other side they say well if the church don't shout then it means they're dead and you find a brother you find that wrong on this side and wrong on this side you find one man wants to make everybody emotional and then one man wants to make everybody dead I say listen if you're a worshiper you got Liberty in the house of God if you want to shout you can shout if you want to say you can say you don't got to do it but just be who you are it's in you brother and sister amen just let it out of who you are amen see what the devil wants to do well well we need to there might be a Revival breakout or somebody really gets loose hey we ought to be the most freest people on the face of the Earth am I think it's a shame amen when Church comes like a place you got to be uncom able listen this ain't an uncomfortable place we're all family listen this is the quietest place you're ever going to be at he said what do you mean what the prophet say in Hell there's going to be weeping and Welling and nashing of teeth and then in the heavens there's going to be shouting and screaming and he said when I get over there oh brother I'm going be free I'm not waiting to get in heaven to enjoy my Liberty I'm not waiting for heaven to praise my God and to give him what he deserve listen I'm not waiting for another day when I can do it right now hallelujah amen I'm not waiting for it you can do it right now see amen you find it on both sides you find getting out of balance on both Sid one says you got to shout one says don't shout I say just be who you are listen I'm not here trying to make you a big shouting church I'm here to I'm here to tell you just be who you are am me listen everybody don't got to shout and scream and do all of that to be a born again believer but I tell you one thing you do have to be a Lively Stone it's the truth you say well brother you you you you you listen to me real quick my dry worship is fine my starchiness is fine sounds like a good Methodist my starching my my routine my tract don't you disrupt me my routine is fine the way I'm doing thing it's just fine anden what are you doing you're doing exactly what the Pharisees did and you're teaching doctrines of man as the Commandment of God Amen see there in a scripture in 1 Peter 2 and5 amen know ye not that ye are dead no it didn't say that know ye not you are stagnated Stones no it didn't say that know ye not ye are Lively Stones listen God ain't looking for some dead church member God is looking for a lively church that has the power of Christ living on the inside of her and I'm telling you he's going to have it he's going to have it he also has Lively stones that build up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God Amen see you you can get out of balance on either side of it you say well I'm fine the way I am my dryness and starchiness is fine well I'll tell you when it ain't fine when it contradicts God's word it is not fine you can be who you are but when it contradicts God's word I'm here to tell you you just can't be who you are amen well I think my way is right and that's exactly what the scripture said there's a way that seems right to a man but the end of it is the ways of death listen I don't want what I think is right I want what I know is right according to the revealed word of God it's exactly right amen you hear it you you you hear it on both ends of the spectrum amen people rise up and they preach against emotionalism and what do they find what do they end up doing the church ends up cooling off and cooling down and that they'll laugh and scorm by the way say look at them people over there they're so out of order and they're them Pentecostal babies and they're and they're crying and running the aisles and they're doing all that and they're out of order amen I like taking things and reasoning together with it do you I like putting it on both sides so so what I do when they say that I throw the ball in their core and say well look at them them dry starchy people they just sat there like a knot on the log amen listen you're just as out of order oh come on Church you're just as out of order if you're sitting like some dry stick amen as the church down the street amen that's hanging on the chandeliers and ripping the paint off the wall listen you say this is out of order well being a dry starching message mossback believer but it's just as out of order as the other end of it I say let's not be out of order to the left and let's not be out of order to the right but let's get in the middle of the road amen where the Prophet said the angel of the Lord is always in the middle of the road Hallelujah I hope this okay well you don't well you know I I just don't have nothing to be happy about I don't got no joy I don't have know you you give me some grace we'll turn into something a little bit deeper here in a minute but I've got to obey the Lord in this amen because some people come and say well I don't I ain't a joyful Christian I don't have joy I don't have why you smile all the time brother the Solomon you you must not have any problems now I got a lot of problems amen but see I don't let my problems take away my joy and I don't let my problems take away the victory that God has put in my soul amen see not having Joy is out of order you say I need a scripture for that I'm glad you're asking 1 Peter 1 and8 whom having not seen ye love and whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory amen you realize you can actually be a joyful Christian you realize you don't have to be negative and you don't have to be well I tell you what if I just had any good luck then maybe I would be happy if I just had something to be happy about then I would be happy amen see what the prophet said Christians are never negative they're never Negative they ain't ever negative amen listen you can have the worst sermon in the world that you hear amen and if you're a true Born Again believer that ain't full of a bunch of negativity you'll find something good to say about that person instead of something negative to say about it because you're listen I thank God I I wish that God would give us a bunch of positive Christians listen I'm not coming to here to be a negative person I'm here to be a positive person am me listen you can sing amen completely off key and can't carry a tune in the bucket and what will you say if you're a positive Christian I tell you what she sings with all her heart that's what God wants us to be I tell you what he he don't he sings with all his heart she can't play that man and Li word nothing but she she gives it everything she's got see and Jo God will judge you for your heart he'll judge you that you're trying to do something for God he I think it's amazing that mostly the critics they ain't doing nothing for God there there say I wish he'd play better why don't you come up here and play I wish he would preach better he come take the microphone I wish brother Aaron will sing better what will you come up here and sing I me let's not be critical of one another because that is out of order amen never get a critical spirit that's exactly what the prophet said amen listen we got enough critics out in the world why don't you let that stuff stay out there don't let a critical spirit come in the house of God to where you're criticizing everybody and criticizing the singers am remember when somebody starts worshiping you say that's the way to do it sister you Worship the Lord or somebody start singing you join in with them and say yes brother amen sing to the Lord and the preacher as well the preacher starts preaching and me you do what the prophet said sicken boy am me sicken brother amen and you you feel them strugging a little bit to get the words out that's when you help them man of God and say sicken preacher y'all know they came to brother random right and said brother R how do you preach them people screaming and hollering like that he said I couldn't preach if they didn't do it see even the prophet dealt with it amen even the prophet dealt with it it helps it'll help your so see he man we want all the pre we want the preacher to do all the preaching you got to put your part in see that's order and that's balance amen if you got the preacher doing all the work to pick the service up you're going to have a man slap more out see what's a way a cross cut saw where I push and you pull and I push and you pull and I push and you pull well preacher I I want I want Revival in the church then you put something in it come on Friends well I I want the Lord to move this morning and you put something in it amen it's easy to say well well we want God to do something we want God to move but you ain't willing to put your shoulder to the wheel amen I say Lord I if I got a press to have church I'm here to press for it if I've got a knock at the door I'm going to keep knocking until I get my prayer answered I'm not waiting on the preacher I'm not waiting on the musician I am here to receive something amen from God himself I tell you what if we get that attitude brother sister there ain't no telling what would happen listen if you don't want something from God that's okay I'll take what you don't want if you don't want a blessing from God that's okay I'll take what you don't want amen if you don't want to praise God that's okay you move aside amen I've got a worship to do I've got a praise to do glory to God Amen that ought to be our attitude Lord I'm here to worship you that's exactly the truth the prophet put all these things in order we know God's a god of order ain't that right am the great of solmon here the prophet says that he said you'll find that God is a God of order now if there's a right order that means in the contrast there's a wrong order we don't want to be in the wrong order we want to be in the right order I believe that God has come to set a church in order and our church should be a church in order I tell you what I believe I believe that God sent us a message to tie up the Luc ends not make more of them amen God sent us a message to so we don't have to wonder well is this out of order is this in order if you got a scriptural question there's a scriptural answer if you got a message question there is a message answer and just because it ain't the answer you wanted don't mean it ain't still an answer that's the truth am mean just because it's not what you was looking for it don't mean it's wrong I mean you ever had somebody ask you a question say well what about this and you already know they ain't asking you because they want to know but they're asking you because they want to tell you they already know it and tell you your answer is wrong it's just the truth brother sister amen but see if we can ever ever humble ourselves and say Lord I want you to put me in order because my ways are wrong and my thoughts they're not wrong they are wrong and your way is the right way that's exactly right amen God sent us a message to tie up the loose we're not here brother sister still wondering and guessing is this wrong is this right is this wrong listen the days of that are over amen we know that the short skirts are wrong we know that the makeup is wrong amen we know that we're not here having to lay the foundation again brother and sister amen listen we're at the Capstone age this is when The Headstone unites to the body listen we're not here asking amen baby questions but Pastor can I do this and get away with it can I do this and get away with it amen you silly child amen listen we're not here to ask questions like that we've got a Rapture to make amen throw out them Saint brother sister amen throw out the of the world stop messing around in the Saints of the world if your left hand offend you then cut it off now what's your left hand well the CNN's my left hand cut it off Fox News is my left hand Facebook's my left hand cut it off if it offends you then cut it off amen Jesus it's a hard thing to do that's why he said cut it off it's hard to cut something off that's attached to you brother sister but see if that's what it takes to get back in order then we've got be willing to cut things off amen for us to be balanced you can't have both your hands right here and you got something weighing you down here and making you act like the world and dress like the world and talk like the world it's because you got something pulling you out of balance I say cut that thing off amen and straighten back up like a Son of God and a daughter of God Amen we ought to not be amen blown around with every amen window doct we ought to be a solid church we ought to be a builtup church when the devil says I think you can do that and get away with it Heen you tell that devil say devil you stop right there amen I don't have time for your lies and I don't have time for your stronghold amen see what the devil will do if he can ever trap a little bit of you in his web he'll trap you in his web just a little bit and he'll keep on wrapping and keep on rapping and before you know you you're still a Son of God you're still a daughter of God but you're trapped in Satan's well hey if I was you brother sister I get a little Pentecostal fire amen and let that fire burn that web off of you and you get straightened back up as a Son of God and straightened back up as a daughter of God I me you ever seen web you put some fire on it brother that web will get gone really quick go try you see old unus spider web put a little bit of we or put a little fire on it but that thing just blow up all together amen see that's what the presence of God can do to a Believer am mean you just get me to Jesus and he'll burn all them things off of me listen you don't have to waste time trying to do it yourself you've got God on your side you don't have to waste time trying to to get balanced and to do this and do you've got God on your side of course you still have to do your part that's exactly right look at Jesus we know he was after the order of mzc is that right and he only did what he saw the father do exactly right in John 5:19 then then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever or for what thingss soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise we know that Jesus would walk in order according to what he saw the father do amen now how many knows that he was after the order of MDC and God would actually give Jesus visions of where to go and what to do Be not Afraid the prophet picks it up he says any Bible student knows that that's true and St John 5:19 Jesus never performed one miracle in his life without first God the Father showing him a vision to do it or he told him something wrong in the Bible for he said verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father do so we know that Jesus brings order by visions is that right amen he brings order by visions and we know ultimately that God brings order and balance by the power of His word how many beles that amen when God wants to create something what to use the power of the spoken word when God wants to set things in order what to use he uses the power of the spoken word in Genesis 1 we find the very prime example in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and then God said and God said let there light and there was light and God saw that the light was good so listen friends this whole earth was without form and void and it was chaos it was vanity it was a wasteland and darkness was over the face of the deep and God wanted to change it amen so you study it out you'll find in the Greek that or in the Hebrew rather that this world was completely void and it was in chaos chaos is the opposite of order right chaos is the opposite of order and so God spoke and said let there be firmament and let there be light and let there be land and let there be seed and let there be herb Let There Be tree and then let every seed bring forth of its kind and then what happened exactly what God Said to happen the earth begin to shape and begin to mold and it got in order because of what because of the word that it heard it was the word that put this Earth in order took something that was chaos and it put it in order oh church if God could set this whole globe in order what makes you say that God cannot put your life back in the order that it needs to be hey if he could remove darkness by the power of His word he can take a dark and Stony heart and can speak to it and say let there be light and let it be firm brother you won't know how you're starting to change but before you know it that malice drops off of you and that Envy drops off of you what is that you're laying in the presence of the word I say that's what we need lay in the presence of the sun amen how you going to grow if you're in the dark how you going to grow if you're in the basement amen how you going to grow if you're not in the sunlight amen see you become the word as you receive that word that's exactly the truth the spirit of God begin to move it's amazing as you study this because this whole world was completely out of order but just one word from the master it took vanity it took Wasteland it took cha just one word amen I know we get stuck in this finite mind and we think it's going to take a seven night prayer Mee and Revival to change things but I'm telling you about a God all he has to do brother sister speak one word over you all amen you realize when the maniac at gadera when they came down to Jesus and and and they cried out said why you come to torment us before our time and then yeah and then they asked Jesus said well let us go into the swine what did Jesus say a two-letter word g go he didn't pray he didn't shout he didn't scream he didn't do nothing he just stood there and used the power of His spoken word and said go amen oh church amen and what are you amen you're a messiah and the prophet said that g or that God would actually he would use Jesus to show you as an example that when he was on a 40-day fast and he was out in the wilderness he you talk about being hungry 40 days no food and no water may I had water I don't know a 40-day fast regardless of brother he was weak in his body and and the tempter AM mean you think you've been tempted when you're amen see Satan knows when to tempt you he don't tempt you when you're all fired up he tempts you when you're in a low spot that's exactly right he tempts you when you're down low and discouraged that is when the tempter came to Christ and you are fighting the same devil that Jesus fought in the mountain that's exactly right and then Jesus stood there and Satan is here said well I tell you what if you'll bow down I'll give you the whole world and the prophet said he gave Jesus a vision and showed him the kingdoms of this world and said if you'll Bow Down and Worship me I'll give you all of this Jesus didn't fight there and deny that it was not his because for a season this world belongs to Satan it's right he's the God of this evil age if you don't think he is go outside and look at the government and see who's running it it's the truth go and look in politics and see who's running it brother amen I'm sorry to bust youren bust your bubble amen but see the devil is the God of this evil age Republican Democratic left and right up and down he is the God of this Earth it's exactly right he said Jesus worship me and I'll give you all of this and what did Jesus do amen he got down and started to pray and started to shout and that's not what he did amen he turned to the word of God and he said Satan it is written you shall not tempt the Lord your God Amen why did Jesus turn to the word listen he could have spoke Lucifer out of existence he could have said devil go back to hell where you come from and he that would have been gone but he didn't do that but he came to the word amen to show you as the Son of God and to show you as a daughter of God all you have to do is stand there and speak the word over that devil and say devil I am more than able Amen to possess the land amen stand and remind the devil of what God Said in his word the devil says you won't ever make it I said devil it is written I am more than a conqueror through Christ that have loved me and the devil says I tell you what I'm a bring a spirit of fear on you anden devil I've got one for that I have not given you a spirit of fear but a spirit of love a spirit of power and a sound mind see Jesus showed you what to do when you're backed up in a corner and you as weak as can be you speak the word over your family you speak the word amen what the prophet say in the church age book you speak the word I'll perform it that's my Covenant with you and it can never fail you don't got to call up amen 1800 Pastor way D Amen to pray you through you don't have to call him a amen I don't care if you're a young person if you're a housewife I don't care how unimportant unimportant most important you feel you can stand any hour of the day and say devil you've got no right in my mind You' got no right on my shoulder and you resist the devil and he has to flee amen see what's the devil doing he says no no no no no you got that's just for the preachers it's a bunch of nicoladis and Spirits is what that is it's just in the ministry it's just for brother brandham well well well I got a big problem with that because William brandham never taught it that way well brother bram's the only one that can speak things into existence and he's the only one that's got the power of the spoken word well I I I see what you're saying but he never taught it that way amen he never taught a onean Ministry but you'll find what this message is always doing is is putting it back on on you hallelujah amen it's putting it back on you you'll never find William say look what I can do and look what only I can do but the prophet's constantly saying amen if the vine ever puts forth another Branch it'll be a continuation of the book of Acts listen William Brandon was not that only Branch brother sister but you are a continuation amen of the book of Acts because you're pulling from the same life source of the original vine you got original word you got original Power that's exactly right and the Masterpiece the prophet tells us here he said how is God making us a masterpiece how was God restoring and balancing us he says he does it by his never changing method the same way he made his first Masterpiece he uses his word you say I want to be a masterpiece listen to the word I I want to be a bride for Christ listen listen to the word I want to be that Michelangelo sculpure that that that Christ's got a vision of me and he's chiseling me amen you need to sit down and listen to your pastors what you need to do it's just the truth brother sister I mean listen the Chisel is the word and the Holy Spirit is the hammer amen it ain't just the man up here telling you what you should and shouldn't do amen you got to look past the veil and say God this is your word this is the message of the hour regardless if it's a 60y old B I'm sorry I hope you're maybe younger than that orever older he just looking at me it don't matter how it don't matter what the veil looks like see that's what the prophet said the problem was is that man gets wrapped up on the veil they said that that's just my brother up there that and that's exactly what the Pharisees did with Jesus they got caught up on the veil I said that ain't God look at him he cries he bleeds that's he ain't Divine look at him out there crying and weeping over the grave of Lazarus but I say look at him when he spoke amen I said Lazarus come forth ammen don't you get so tripped up on the veil that you miss the message don't get so wrapped up on the ve listen I want to give you a great news flash your pastor's a [Music] man sister Jun said a man he's a man old man that's the truth you get so concerned on the veil you get so concerned on the man you forget the message amen see listen you can't get I think it's amazing there in the Old Testament that God would hide behind Badger skins now I don't know if you know this but a badger is the most meanest animal there is a badger is a mean mean mean animal but that would hide the shakana glory of God Amen showing you brother it don't matter what you Veil God in brother sister amen you're veiling him in this flesh it's exactly right amen you're veiling him in this flesh but it is still God the word and the prophet said that's what God is doing he's using that word he's using that word to make us his Masterpiece so we know it would take a perfect bride to put us in perfect order how many believes that and how many believes we got a perfect word amen now listen how does God bring us his word now he uses he amen the way God brings us his word is by the prophets you say well I don't need a prophet yes you do I don't need a prophet to get God's word I got God himself but that's not God's order and that's not how God set it up well well I'll tell you what I'm not going to sit down and I'm not going to brother amen you just might be in the seat of Cain if that's your attitude because remember when God came or God came to Kane said Cain if you'll just do what your brother did he had an opportunity to get in order he had an opportunity to get in life K if you'll just do what your brother I love love you I'll receive you I'll take you to myself and then Kan said if you don't want my way and you don't want my offer and you're not getting nothing of it amen see listen folks there's some people you can preach to them till you're blew in the face and you won't ever change them you won't change what they're going to do because in their mind they have determined the way I'm doing it is the right way and the order in which I'm doing it is the right order so don't get mad at the person you've got to realize they're under a spiritual problem in their mind listen you can bring a horse to the water but you can't make them drink it's the truth it's up to them it's up to you if you want to get in order amen listen if you want to be out of order church it's because you want to be amen if you want to have your home out of order and instead of having God and the man and the wife and the children and you got the wife over the man and the man over God if you want to run your house that way it's up to you but you don't have to do it that way amen God sent us a prophet to put the home in order you said well I want God to bless my home then get back in line I want God to bless my church then get back in line you realize what the prophet said he said God could only bless the children of Israel when they was in the Homeland when they was in the Homeland he said and God will only bless you when you're in the Homeland and he said where is the Homeland it's in the message of the hour Hallelujah where is the Homeland and send the message of the hour underneath Divine leadership and divine headship and a Hess in order amen I say men be the men of your house and sisters be the pastor of the house and be the pastor of your children that's the order God sent it in come back around to this as God gives us order by His prophets you you all remember there in Exodus the 20th chapter 9 he told me to preach as long as I wanted to but I'm going to try not to but you find in actus the 20th chapter that the children of Israel came to Moses and said Moses don't speak don't don't let God speak to us it's fearful we might die paraphrasing it's fearful we might die amen and then he tells Moses and they said to the Moses speak speak now with us and we'll hear but let not God speak and you'll find that after this that that no more God would speak to the children of Israel but he would use a prophet to speak to them and then what did God tell Moses he said Moses you be God to the people and you let Aaron be your Prophet that's amazing that you find this type all the way in the book of Exodus because here was a man he says Moses you be like God and you speak and tell Aaron what to say and then Aaron will be the prophet and he'll give your message to the children of Israel and God has done the same thing this is not William Brandon's message this is not the message of a man amen but God Amen here's the roles you've got God and you've got Aaron also known as Elijah the prophet amen and God put the words in his mouth and then from him he would give it unto the church amen this is not the message of a man this is a message from God himself and God was showing us in type all the way in Exodus the 20th chapter that I'm not going to speak to you by my lips anymore more but I'm going to use the ministry of a prophet where do you get the order where do you get Raymond restoration from a prophet's message amen Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing unless he Reveals His secret to his servants the prophet so we find very scripturally that God by His prophets brings the order back to the church and the prophets clear on it he said we've had these reformers and they were good men he said but see they still baptized in titles they still baptized in father son Holy Ghost and they Still Smoked cigars and they still died all those things he said they was anointed and they tore those things to Pieces he said but the full word of God never come to them because they were not prophets they were reformers but he said in the last days it's going to take a prophet it's going to take a prophet to take these mysteries of God and bring it back up because the Mysteries is only known by the prophets now it's amazing as you see this because God would bring order throughout the church ages and what is God doing he's laying the he's laying the pyramid he's laying in faith he's laying in knowledge he's laying in Temperance and you'll find every time God would sent forth we know that God was sent forth a major prophet in the Ephesian church or in the Ephesus Church age right amen unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus right and so on and then along in that church age God would send an anointing amen and during that time we all know you're very well taught I'm not going to to take a lot of time in these but God was send an anointing along with that message and then you'll find all the way amen here we are at the Capstone age of Brotherly kindness and the Capstone being love and then God would send us another message amen another Prophet it's amazing I know many of you know this but but youd ever take and study it out there in the Book of Revelation you'll find that for sure it's a first prophet in the first church age and the last Church age it's in the reading the prophet actually talks about it amen unto the angel of the church and then the rest of unto the angel in the church unto the angel in the church and then you'll find in Leia unto the angel of the church showing you this is not going to be a Reformation message but it's going to be a restoration message and I think it's amazing because God did not just send us the word but he sent us the spirit with the word how many believe that God did not just send us the mechanics but he sent us to dyamics and the mechanics and he said the Dynamics of this church would be what amen the refilling of the Holy Ghost amen and I want to turn a corner we'll bring it close shortly but I want to preach to you here for a moment because in every age God would send forth that anointing of a lion an anointing of an ox and you look at them them Martyrs how many's ever read that Fox's book of Martyrs and you read about them Martyrs and they was burnt to death and burnt to the steak and women they catched their hair on fire and many grew some things that they would amen kill Christians it's amazing many testimonies you can read about because there was this one man he was on a cross and they set up a fire underneath him and he just stood there tied up to a cross being burnt to death and he singing worship songs and he's singing Praise songs and then I got to think him of the way I thought my God how could a man he's being burnt to death and being tortured and if there was ever time to not have church that was a time to not have church if there was ever time to be discouraged that was a time to be discouraged but he was there on that cross and just begin to worship God and begin to praise God Amen and then it connected very clearly to me because the prophet said that the church can only do what she is Anointed to do I thought well there's the picture the reason they could stand there is because they was underneath a beast of burden and they was anointed to lay down their life for the cause of the gospel and I studied it out and I saw the man anointing amen I saw how Luther and the prophet talked about them he said he wasn't it wasn't the mystery how he could protest the Catholic church and all of that he said the mystery was how he kept his head above all that fanaticism he said to me that was a mystery and I thought well how could he do that and the pressure that he fought it's because God released an anointing upon that church so they could live out the word for their age now listen friends you're not under an ox anointing you're not under an eagle anointing but or you you are under an eagle anointing that's the anointing that God has given to you now listen amen because people say well and you hear young people say well you know I I I'd live the message but it's just too hard to live and and and I'd really sell out to God but it's just too difficult to do amen I'm here to tell you this morning God has given you the tools you need for the job and listen the church can only do what she is Anointed to do you said well preach I'll tell you what I'm anointed to be discouraged that's not right i'm anointed to be disappointed but that is not right actually you're too anointed to be disappointed that's just some good charismatic preaching but I like it am me listen you ought to be too anointed to be disappointed amen listen you're not anointed for failure you're anointed to overcome this world you're not anointed for defeat you're anointed to Amen to overcome the God of this evil land he said but I can't do it I'm not able to do it you're exactly right you can't do it amen but greater is he greater is he that is in you and he is in the I don't have the strength that's okay because my strength is made perfect in your weakness I don't know how much more I can handle amen that's okay because when your strength runs out God is a god of unlimited resource he's a god of unlimited Revival if you want out God has got some more it's the truth amen the church can only do what she's anointed for you realize you can't help but overcome how because you're anointed for it they couldn't help but give their lives for the cause of Christ and you can't help but overcome That Old Devil Glory I'm feeling good this morning you can't help but overcome every devil in hell amen young people I'm telling you you're unstoppable amen you can't help but overcome this world because God has anointed you to do it that is your order amen over well what what do I do overcome that's what you do what do I do so it's amazing because as you study that eagle anointing out you find it's one of the only anointings that he don't really have a lot of strength an eagle is not a real strong bird right amen Eagle ain't real strong you can take its wings and break it fairly easy amen because they're light and amen a got hollow bones and so on anden they're a very weak animal but see the thing about that eagle is it's not relying on its own strength it's not relying on its own ability but it knows that God sent forth a wind it knows that God sends a wind upon the face of the earth and the prophet said I was out there in the woods and I looked at that eagle he said it just took two or three flaps and it was just far as the eye can see because it learned how to do what it learned how to surrender to the power of the wind and the wind could carry him higher than where he was because he learned to surrender you said brother I want to come up higher amen the problem is not with the anointing the problem is with you the problem is not with God the problem is with you you're here trying to fly and get high and get high you are not a crow you're an eagle you got to learn to surrender to the power of the Holy Ghost I say God give us a church that will surrender to the anointing of the spirit of God you said well preacher I'm on the ground and this one's attacking me and this one's attacking me you realize what that Eagle's got to do he don't stand there and get his claws out and fight and fight and fight and fight the crows all he does is relies on that wind and that wind will take him up to a place Hallelujah that wind will take him up to a if he can just learn to surrender to it that wind will take him up to such a spot to where the crows ain't able to get up there and the vultures ain't able to get up there listen I'm telling you there's a place that you can go that the devil don't even know what to do with you I said God bring the church amen to a place where the devil don't know what to do amen bring a young person Amen to the place where the devil don't know what to do with them stop trying to fight on the Devil's Ground you go up higher than where he is it's the truth amen you've been restored you've been placed God has placed you underneath this anointing amen by the message of the hour it has balanced you out it has placed you upon a rock the revelation of who Christ is and the revelation of who the true church is it's exactly the truth praise the Lord I mean the devil don't have a lot of stronghold on that eagle let me tell you about it stop trying to fight the devil out there in the world you bring him to the house of God am I heard brother Wayne Lawson tell tell a story one time he was talking about wrestling with a dog he said he had that dog and pl tug war on y'all probably done that I'm sure they been playing tug with this dog and he said I had that dog on the carpet and he had so much pool and so much G he just nearly pull you over is what he's talking about he said but if I ever move that dog over to the tile if I ever move that dog over to the tile he was just spinning his wheels and he couldn't go nowhere amen he said I thought about that Old Devil amen because you get out of here brother sister and you're living in Satan's Eden listen but you are going to feel the pool of Darkness you're going to feel the pool of the stronghold am but see what you need to do is stop trying to fight the devil on his territory but you bringing to God's territory and you say devil you might have a lot of pull on me out there but you just come onto the house of God and you sat here and listen to that word and before you know it brother that devil will lose his pull amen he'll be pulling and pulling and pulling amen and you'll realize you got the power over that thing Hallelujah bring him on God's term stop trying to fight them Problems by yourself bring them down to the house of God it's just the truth well that's what we're here for amen we're here for one another don't fight the Devil by yourself if you're battling with something come here let's pray with you amen if the devil's Bing your mind amen you don't have to sit there isolate yourself that's exactly what the devil wants you to do is make you ashamed of your battles and make you Ash but you realize them ain't yours that's what the devil's trying to do to you those are not your thoughts that's the devil thought in your mind amen it's not but it's the devil tempting you it's the devil trying you God is not doing that God tempts no man what the Bible says it's the devil the devil's the tempter the devil's the one tempting you and trying to trip you and trying to catch you amen I tell you what you do and you come to a solid believer what the prophet say Amen conduct ording the doctrine and all these other amen messages he put it all in order it's exactly the truth how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you guide you into all truth he'll not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak he will show you things to come amen listen friends this is this message this message is the spirit of Truth amen listen who was that Mighty Angel it was only Christ amen only Christ that could have been amen you listen what the prophet said in the breach he said here come that lamb that been slain amen since the foundation of the world he took the book he opened the book and tore the hills off and he sent it back down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to the people amen and people want to come along and say well I tell you what you know that's just brother ROM's thoughts and that's brother ROM's opinion you better be careful with an idea like that well well that was just brother Ram's uh approach on it you better be very careful amen saying that that's just brother Ram's idea I tell you what I'll take a prophet's opinion I'll take a prophet's opinion over what many preachers say in any day of the month brother a sister I'll take what the prophet thought about it amen because last time I check I don't have a pillar of fire above my head neither do anybody else but God did send a prophet that was thoroughly Vindicated amen and God was not ashamed to have his photograph taken with the prophet so why would I be ashamed to tell you what he said and why would I be ashamed to be ID did I me listen I'm not ashamed Amen to be identified as a born again Holy Ghost filled in time message believer with rapturing faith and rapturing grace and the day I ever get ashamed you grab me and pray for me and we ought to never be ashamed for this message it is the spirit of Truth and I'll say this if you ever get a man truly truly born again he'll come to this message he'll come to this message you say you mean to tell me them folks out there in them churches they don't have the Holy Ghost not the true born again if they do they're going to come to this message eventually I'm not saying when I'm not saying it won't be a process but there it'll create such a search in them it'll create such a hunger and they'll be searching for truth but they'll sit there and know they ain't a chicken they'll sit there and know I can't eat this vomit on the table they'll sit there and know I can't this is not my kind of food and it will send them on a search and God knows who are his own and brother Bob he'll let somebody come to you at work and then you'll be begin to witness on them but that's how God works this message is the spirit of Truth where did the Earthly Angel get that message from Christ The Mighty Angel it's ain't his thoughts it came from Christ The Mighty Angel we've got a wonderful message we've got a powerful message we've got a positive faith building message that came from God himself and God gave it to the prophet and the prophet gave it to you and I I me it's amazing because God would begin to amen Focus the prophet's Ministry there in 1963 upon the word and we all know when he's there in Sabino Canyon and the sword comes down and it's in his hand brother said I was always afraid of a sword and brother said that's that third pole it's the opening of the word it's your ministry you say why are you preaching about that because I want to ask you a question because we're here amen and we have been restored and we've been balanced and we've been placed because a lot of people don't have any issue saying William Brandon was Revelation 10:7 but when you go on down to Revelation 10:9 when you go on down to Revelation 108 and John is told to take the book and to eat the book oh brother amen let me tell you this very clearly amen John is told to take the book out of the hand of that angel and I want you to notice John tied that bride and listen it's amazing because it shows you something very powerful because John actually would take the book out of the hand of the mighty Angel yes he did right did but I thought we got the message from the seventh angel as son of man Ministry very perfectly that's exactly right it's the ministry of Christ it's the ministry of the son of man amen he has no body but our body he has no voice but the prophets he does nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophets it's exactly the truth brother sister amen so where did you take the book out of the hand of you got it out of the hand of the Prophet hallelujah amen you got it out of the hand of the Prophet amen listen we come to this message and say give me this food amen give me this body word of the son of man amen give me something to eat give amen I take a book listen let me tell you very clearly and closely you don't have to beg the bride to take the book I don't have to come here brother the Bonet and say but you better eat this food you better take this and you don't got to do that to the bride but she comes ready she's got her cup lifted up and says God I I want to eat this morning God I I want to feed this morning listen we are hungry in our souls brother sister and listen let me tell you the only thing that will satisfy your soul is the word of God this world can't satisfy me amen I want to tell you there ain't nobody that Can Do Me Like Jesus can there ain't nobody that can satisfy me like Jesus is able to Hallelujah you don't have to beg her to eat the word amen you read in Revelation 10:11 he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples people say well I'm not a preacher but you can speak that word I'm not this and I'm not that but you can speak that word I know what the prophet said in the Patmos fion he said the word has never failed somebody saying never the word has never failed in the mouse I believe in Christians how many Believers we got here and believ in Christians the word has never failed and the Devil comes to you and says you don't got no Ministry you're not important I want to tell you the bride has a Ministry the bride has a voice amen she is the final voice to the final age it's exactly the truth you are the final voice to the final age it is not William brandom it is the bride that's the final one but she is a continuation of the voice because the word and the prophet and the bride the spirit and the bride they're all saying the same thing it's even so come Lord Jesus never failed in the m in the mouths of believing Christians and he said in this last age it's here stronger it's here stronger and greater than it ever was in the true word bride he said oh little flock you little minority hold on on to the word fill your mouth and heart and someday God will give you the kingdom amen I want to challenge you take the word if you're weak this morning amen whosoever will let him come and take it I'm telling you there's a fountain open in the House of David this morning amen if you're thirsty let him come if you're hungry let him come if the devil's got you in a corner speak the word over him you are the bride of Christ you're exactly what God Said you areen stand to your feet if you will amen Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise Hallelujah musicians go ahead and come than you Lord how many believes it this morning amen we're balanced we're restored it's exactly the truth prophesy again you speak the word amen not brother brandom speak the word and I'll perform I'm challenging you to speak the word amen see if the devil can if he can silence your voice he pretty much has you whipped see because it's all in the scripture it's all in the word of God see the Bible said if you say unto the mountain brother I I don't got to say I'll just think about it don't think about it speak it and if the devil has you in a corner speak to that devil say devil enough is enough I'm tired of dealing with this I'm tired of being this way amen if the devil's in your family and giving you anxiety and complexes and a critical spirit speak to that devil and say devil you got to find somebody else to work through because I ain't going to be your donkey anymore you're not riding on my shoulders no more you're not riding here no more you're not using my lips no more amen speak to the devil and tell them devil enough is enough amen where is that sword that was in the prophet's hand you ever thought about that yes sir where is that I in Jeffersonville Indiana in the Tomb that's not there oh it's at the gravide it's in a brandom tabern that's not where it is that King sword was to power the third pool it's in the hand of the bride of Christ you believe that it said your hand now last time I checked a sword don't hurt nobody unless you start swinging it a sword don't do nothing to anybody unless you start swinging it sister you got to swing the sword on that devil brother you got to swing the sword on that de what the prophet say if he don't move what you do whack him again and whack him again well brother I whacked him once whack him again but I I hit that depression once whack him again ammen you keep on taking that sword and you keep on whacking that devil amen and eventually that Devil's going to leave you alone God bless you God bless you we'll turn it to you song leader he'll make me stop am I have heard thy voice and it thy love to me but I long to rise in the arm [Music] closer if you have a need spirit of God is here

where it come from it came straight from God so why do you want another message why do you want another Prophet we got one brother Ram said the prophet was the Holy Ghost amen because brother Adam's not here physically but the holy ghost that was in him is here now same Holy Ghost sure he had a prophetic gift that we don't have like he had as all over the world but he called us little Messiahs whatever he got we get right amen it's distributed amongst the bride now yes there was many pages in that book John eat them all yes sir he didn't leave an outside cover he didn't leave what he didn't like come on he didn't leave the part he didn't like he didn't tear it out and put it over here he ate the whole book yes and what did it do it disappeared yes sir it disappeared you don't see that book no more yes sir till over to White Throne judgment when that book's open it ain't going to be a big old book with Dusty you know from the end time you are the book you're the book that's going to
