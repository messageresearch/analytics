your blessing upon us tonight Lord as we enter into these things in your name amen so Revelation 4 verse1 says and I'm going to get my phone out cuz I didn't put all of these scriptures in my notes um after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be the Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a sarden stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and round about The Throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne preceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now that's that's pretty amazing singing there that John was looking at and uh I I I I thank God that we've had a prophet in this age to break these things down to us so that we can we can have something to peer into uh a good explanation to to peer into what John was looking at there but I want to kind of back up and kind of kind of review some of the things we've been studying out that at John there in in verse one said after this I looked now you think about after this after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and John John heard that voice calling him up but after after this and you think about after all the things that he had uh seen in in Revelation Chapter 3 The that uh Church ages being laid out that that the church ages type it it displays this picture of the of the Journey of the church from Ephesus all the way to Leota that each Church age messenger preaching a message and open up a door a way of Escape out of the carnality of the people the people the denominational system of that day a way that they could get into the truth as God revealed in each age a little bit more word more word building something up but now look now in the of a perfect man brother Brown said that as the church grows so does the individual grow so now you look at your own life and see now after after all these things after you come up after you come up through all these things that brother Way's been reviewing all the way up to brotherly kindness now after all these things then God sent a prophet to us to preach a word to to preach to preach a go a message to us to give us the full complete revelation of who Jesus Christ is now now now see let's just lay it out real plain what's going to give you Rapture in faith is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ when you have a complete Revelation now now that your soul not only your soul but your spirit has been redeemed that your spirit has been aligned to the word that you hold in your soul and that your body has been changed by the revealing of the word and that you are matching up with the word that God thought about you from the foundation the world now you got some matching pieces the matching pieces line up so that the word will draw the word now you've got a door opened up in heaven and that's why John said after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and brother R said that voice was the same voice that spoke to him on Earth and we've been laying out this the same voice the same voice that's been calling you the whole time the same voice that was talking to John that whole time the same voice that was calling you from the the time you you first heard that little that little tug and the little Mission meeting or the camp meeting or whatever it was the same voice that's been dealing with you all the time is the voice that called John up because John John types the bride so let's put yourself there in that situ put yourself there when you read that that John represents you and brother Ram said he was in the candlesticks speaking from them to his church The Voice that when the church age had ceased he left the Earth and moved up into the heavens and he called his redeemed up with him higher and what was it a revelation a revelation to come up higher am Behold a door was opened in heaven now scriptures got a lot of places talking about doors and now if we can we can really just kind of uh let's let's not make it complicated let's let's get real simple let's go back to all these Bi Bible stories that we we heard about when we were little kids listening to our mama tell us Bible stories before he went to bed at night let's go back to some of the basics uh I remember there's a story of a door that was open that no man could open or shut when Noah was preaching out there preaching to to come into the ark and there was a door in the side of that ark that Noah didn't shut no Noah couldn't shut it and you know a lot of these pictures that are are that you you read in the Bible you little bible stories that you tell your kids and so forth that that Noah that they depict that that door being great big great huge thing that a man wouldn't be wouldn't have the strength to open or shut or anything oh you think about now Noah preaching and preaching if you could the only way that you're going to escape death in that day was to get in that door into that door of the Ark there was one door one door to that Ark and no man could sh open it or no man could shut it it had to be it had to be God Alone could shut that Arc and seal you in if you if you get in that Ark then you'd be saved now now see that's the Simplicity of what we're talking about here let's let's let's break it down tonight we're not talking about something that's beyond the reach of the little children we're talking about coming to a complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the door what is the door the door is Christ and the door is brother R would say the door is the Holy Ghost the door is the spirit the door is your revelation of who he is that when as you receive the word it's it's built up within you it's actually producing in you the same life that was in Jesus Christ and that Revelation and that life and the characteristics and all those things built up within you that is what's going to take you out of here now you see in in Noah's day it didn't matter it didn't matter how good you were it didn't matter how how many soup suppers you went to how many birthday parties you went to how many events you went to a lot of times maybe we'll get caught up and thinking well if we can just get everybody to go to the event that I planned or all the different kind of things and we'll we'll be all we'll be real good Christians but we forget about the door it don't matter how the events and different things that you go to as just being part of the assembly if you don't go in the door it it's great to be real sweet and kind to one another and be good citizens and and and do your civic duty and all those kind of things but don't forget about the door you got to go you got to get in Christ it doesn't do you any good to just be amongst the Believers in church and get around one another and fellowship and and pay your tith and all that kind of stuff if you if you forget about the door you got to come in the door cuz if you don't go in the through the door if you don't go get in the ark then you're you're going to die you got to get in the door or else you're going to die and the door the door was open to who whoever believed Noah's message that's right oh could it be that simple now brother said in the conflict between God and Satan he said that's where we're standing today brother at the door of the Ark Christ is that door if you'll take that literally and want to work on it a little bit take over in Revelations between the Philadelphian and the layout of seean age he said I set a door open before you and you refused it see that's the hour We're living just before the destruction an open door but they wouldn't listen now they turned him outside now what what's the open door we'll study these things the the door the door is Jesus Christ and each age the revelation of Jesus Christ grows and grows and grows until finally Martin Luther preached justification and and John Wesley preached uh he what was John Wesley preaching he was preaching sanctification that God could take your new birth experience and and grow it up until you come to full stature that's what he was preaching because he would use scriptures like Ephesians 41112 and 13 talking about how we got to come to the full stature he would use that to explain his doctrine of sanctification that's why brother BR said Martin Luther preached justification what was he saying Martin Luther preached the correct way to be born again and John Wesley preached he preached furtherance to that he was preaching that you got to grow that God will take your Born Again experience and start taking away all the carnality from your life and begin to shape you into a stature and there's your open door it's opening up what the growth of the full the full understanding of who Jesus Christ is and and the door was set before him what a a more mature uh bringing bringing laying before him more of God and they turned it away when isusa Street the baptism of the Holy Ghost was presented before them and they turned it away and the furtherance moving up into the higher realm of of the revelation of Jesus Christ and the denominations cabbaged down on what they believed and rejected what God was given to him and Revelation chapter 4 part part one or message the first message brother ra preached he said there's only one way that goes into the body of Christ there's only one door to the Church of the Living God and Jesus is that door I am the door I am the way the road that leads to the door I am to the door to the Sheepfold now all the way down through the scripture Jesus Christ has always been the door and he's the door out of every Church age you hear that word and you could leave you could leave the denominational idea and get into Christ in 2 Corinthians 2:12 Paul said further more when I came to troas to preach Christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the Lord and brother BR said the greatest missionary Endeavor of that age that was God Called It Paul called it a door that a door was being open what a a greater opening of the the pouring out of the Holy Ghost God opening up a way for Paul to take that gospel the word that he was preaching in a in a missionary end Endeavor that would spread all over the world and he said who would dare deny the mighty Ministry of Phillip who would Den dare to deny the mighty ministries of irenius Martin Columbo Patrick and countless scores of others who have had God's anointing upon them yes the Bible Way is the real way of the open door what cuz the gospel being preached opens up a way of Escape for you that you can get out of your carnality and he said a door had been opened in the Philadelphian age signifying the tremendous missionary effort of that age and Revelation 3:8 it says I Know Thy Works behold I have sit before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has kept my word and H has not denied my name now now he said it did not have in the Philadelphian age it didn't have the open door of power it ought to have had notice in the same verse he mentions this open door he says Thou Hast little strength that's right the power of the spirit was missing in that age the word was well preached it was well able to make Souls wise un salvation but the great power of God that showed forth his mighty works that may bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups yet praise God it was growing and had increased over what they had in the Reformation what's growing the more words you got what what is the word the word word makes a way for the spirit the more word you have the more Spirit you have and the more Spirit the more power because so the word the word is your power the more word you've got so that's why he's saying it's growing and had increased over what they had in the reform AG reformation and that every age it grew and grew until finally now let's let's see I want to I'm going to skip down to this the power the full power the full anointing was restored and brother Ram said in the Philadelphian Church age he said he there was a little muhammadan woman that was the when he was over there speaking to the muhammadans they they come to listen and hear what he had to say and the little muhamad and woman came on the platform to be healed and he said now then if Jesus will come and reveal to me what your trouble is or what you are here for if he can tell me what your past is surely you can believe for the future she said through her interpreter yes I can I said said all right may he do it those muhammadans were watching intently they were all leaning forward to see what would happen then the Holy Spirit spoke your husband is a short heavy set man with a black mustache you have two children you were at the doctor's about 3 days ago and he gave you an examination you have a Cy on the womb she bowed her head and said that is true I asked her how is it you came to meet a Christian why didn't you go to your Muhammad and prophet and she said I think you can help me I said I can't help you but if you receive Jesus Christ as your savior he who is here now and knows all about you he'll help you and she said I accept Jesus as my savior he said that did it now listen to what he's talking about he's talking about the power is being restored he said she was healed and about 10,000 muhammadans came to Christ that day because the gospel was preached in both word and power that the gospel all you ought to think about that when the gospel is preached in both word and power a full restoration of the word see that's what we're called for and they say not just a partial word not a partial understanding not a partial anointing but the full anointing of of the power of God back in the church revealing himself as the son of man back in the bride again he said God never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us what did he give us he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we are supposed to use that is what gave Paul his great and effective Ministry and first and then he quotes First Corinthians or 1 Corinthians 2:4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power now there you come into an Open Door in heaven a place a place where the bride is coming to where the full word is Back Being restored back where there's not that you've got Clarity that there's no confusion in your mind of what you're doing here and what your purpose is and whether God wants you to be healed or even whether God wants you to take a body change but you know where you stand what is it what is this door that I'm talking about it's the spirit of God working in his people again it's God restored back again the word restored back the spirit restored back it's God working in you and I it's deity actually making a way it's deity in you making a way for his word his person his life is the door you remember the parable that Jesus told where the the shepherd will actually lay down in the Sheepfold and the shepherd would become the door and he would lay in there and all the sheep that were in the Sheepfold would be protected by the shepherd that's laying there because the shepherd becomes the door what is the Sheep the shepherd is the very life of the the it's the Life of Christ the cont the complete Revelation the complete life of Jesus Christ has come back and brother Ione say Jesus is the door he is the door of the sheep and notice that it speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him and that Revelation is opening up what to bring us strength to give you strength to illuminate the word those three things to bring us strength to illuminate the word and to glorify his name it was in the midst of the two last stages that the re revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us yeah we knew he was God how else could he be our savior but to know that he was only God or God Alone that he was the Alpha and the Omega that this Jesus was both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost all one person that had been lost since the first church ages but now we are seeing it again the revelation of who he was had come back and that's why you see one on the throne the revelation of who he is it's opening up that's that picture that John saw he's seing a picture of God's deity revealed the life of God God and that Emerald rainbow the all these things signifying the power of God the four beasts indeed godhead is not a threers god with one personality for it takes personality to make a person if there was one personality there is one one person but they who believe in three persons have a three God godhead and a guilty of breaking the first commandment in Revelation CH 4 when brother R preached this he said there's only one way that goes into the body of Christ there's only one door to the Church of the Living God and Jesus is that door I am the way I am the door I am the way the road that leads to the door I am the door to the Sheepfold he said he said to this church age I've set before you an open door he said to the Methodist Church age they turned away from it went in organization but I've set before you an open door now after they had received sanctification he said I'll put the open door which is what the Holy Spirit by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body which is Christ he s that message before the Methodist church and they turned aside from it they come up to sanctification and refuse the Holy Ghost remember that that open door they come up to sanctification and refuse what's that Holy Spirit way up there they turned they refused it how do you get get into Christ by one Spirit Holy Spirit which is Christ Spirit we've entered in not by handshaking not by sprinkling but by one Holy Ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and what made partakers of that body one Holy Ghost baptism into that door what is and what is the Holy Ghost brother R said it's God's Open Door the Holy Spirit what is it it's God's open door to all these things it's God God's open door to Christ which has God proved that he raised up Jesus from the dead and those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him at the resurrection what is it it's the Life of Christ in the church the spirit of God is the open door now now if the spirit of God is the open door the spirit of God is what you need the spirit of God will make the word live so don't be afraid of it oh don't be afraid of it like Augustine was when he wrote down the the his experience about how the spirit of God was trying to come on him and he resisted it and wouldn't let it so many people they'll see the they see the spirit of God begin to move in a congregation the spirit of God begin to move in people and they they'll get afraid of it like the disciples when they were on that boat and they saw Jesus come walking across the water the very thing that they needed they were they got afraid of it an open door and set before you just like it was in Noah's day when he was preaching his heart out and only eight Souls got in that Ark what is the open door I said door it's a way of escape a way out of your carnality and a way out of your temper way out of your hatefulness way out of your addictions an escape out of all your sin and your lust and your pride and your worldliness it's a door out of this old sinful World God has provided a way of Escape oh you think about when we're when we're studying through the book of Hebrews all the things that we're seeing in this day as the word begins to open up to us these these are things that all the Old Testament Saints long to see Abraham longed to see these promises being fulfilled he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God the Saints of old long to see all these promises but now you and I are living in the day when these promises are being fulfilled like he in Hebrews chapter 12 where Paul said but ye are come they couldn't they couldn't come to these things but ye are come unto Mount Zion You' come to the thing that they were looking for ye are come under Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the thing that Abraham was looking for he was looking for a city but you come now the city the city is this right here the city is is that you've come to this you've come to the revelation of the truth you've come to the to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the things that they were only looking for but you've come to it he said you've come to the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an inumerable company of angels to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel we we are here at the moment at the moment at the junction of time when a bride will come to maturity when the word all these promises are being fulfilled right in our sight I ought to think that the spirit of the Living God is what's going to catch us out of here two will be in the field and one shall be taken and the other left two will be grinding at the meal one will be taken and the other left and and John said he said the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me that voice is still speaking today and that voice when it speaks it always causes a response in the Sheep oh doesn't it do something doesn't it just do something with God to know that God has prepared a way of Escape for you that God loves you enough to want to reveal himself to to you that that you don't have to go down but you can go up that God's made a way for you to go up and John said immediately I was in the spirit oh you think now now when you really begin to meditate on the word you start to get in the spirit and you got to get in the spirit here's really what I'm taking my text from tonight you got to get in the spirit you when the word begins to be preached something begins to take hold in you and you begin to realize that it's possible for you no matter what kind of situation life has got you in you the devil's got you all cabbaged down and it G and your little little sphere of carnality and then the word begins to be preached and you begin to realize that God's got a promise laying there in the scripture for you now brother R said we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here you got to get in the spirit you go to a dance hall you've got to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance oh and let's let's let's just kind of sit on these things for a little bit tonight and just think about these things what he's really trying to get us to see that you go to a dance hall and you ain't going to dance unless you get in the spirit of the things that are taking place everybody else in that place is dressed now if you're going to go to somebody's going to a dance hall we don't believe in that kind of stuff but people that do that you go to a dance hall and the people that are going to dance are dressed for dancing they're there to dance and you start listening to the music and you going to start dancing cuz when you get in the spirit of that thing that you're there to do you go to the church you've got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship you got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship now oh think now brother Brown is saying you can't worship unless you get in the spirit of worship he said the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days and God's promised that these things would be here and that's what we've got we're in the last days and men and women are setting asleep and don't realize it now that's that's a spiritual condition where people can come to the house of God and they're just they're just there to just kind of sit there and be among people and see the problem is they're not going in the door they're not getting in the door they're not getting in the spirit of the thing they're not getting in the spirit of what this message was sent to do this message was sent to give you out of your condition it was sent to bring deliverance and what you do is you don't get in the spirit of the age you don't get in the spirit of what the message was sent to do you just you just you what people are doing is they're failing to get involved in the thing they're failing to give their all they're failing to get in their Spirit of reading their Bible and listening to the message and failing to get in the spirit of getting in their prayer claw and getting along with God and finding out whether it's really right or not now you know you you go online and you find out if you type in what does it mean to get in in the spirit the dictionary definition says it means to become involved in to take part in something with enthusiasm in other words when it says get in the spirit it means it matters to you and you see what the what what the problem with many of us in this day is it just doesn't matter to us anymore we come to the house of God and it don't really matter to us we yet we're we come and we're not expecting to hear from God anymore we're coming to just check off our list of things to do in the week and it do but it doesn't matter because our heart's not in it we don't really care I I wonder if you could look back in your life and remember when you first came to God and you just love God it what you didn't care so much about all the arguing and debating about which doctr was right or not but you just love God I wonder if we could go back to that first time remember remember when you love God and that's why you come to church and that's why you prayed and that's why you read your Bible because you fell in love with Jesus Christ I wonder tonight if we've forgotten our first love because if you're in the spirit of the thing you'll be involved in it and you will love God you will love his word you won't you won't be aching and wondering when the preacher is going to close his Bible because it'll be something real for you there's something within you it's crying out feed me God I want more of you it means to become involved in to take part in something with enthusiasm to start to feel as happy excited as the people around you oh if we can get excited about God if you can begin to get excited about God excited about coming to church something's going to happen what's brother bam saying he's saying you got to get in the spirit before before something's happening before something will happen now you oh to think now when you see when you see Christians worshiping and raising their hand and praising God and saying amen you might as well worship too because that's what we're here to do in church even the preacher behind the pullit is here to worship God that's what preaching is is worshiping God that's why that that's why preaching preaching really is the highest form of worship because oh you to think about that to be able to speak life into somebody else to be able to speak encouragement to tell somebody else that if you look to Christ that God will take care of your problems if you'll trust in him he'll carry you through oh that's worship right there you're entering into worship you're entering into something higher something with thought to be able to lead people in worship to tell them about Jesus Christ that's worship right there when you see Believers in the house of God dressing right and living right well you might as well dress right through get in the spirit when you see other people claiming their inheritance and claiming their promise and living for God well you might as well too you might as well be encouraged and say if somebody else can receive it I might as well do it too when you might oh when you see somebody get being delivered of their bonds and breaking out in Liberty you might as well too get in the spirit brother BR said that's what the matter with this meeting tonight hold on think about that oh think about that as we enter into these weekends the weekend's meeting with brother Willam preaching that's what's the matter with this meeting tonight if you can't get in the spirit you don't see nothing N I wonder if that's our problem tonight oh brother Bob if you could just make some charts if you could just make it more simpler then I could see it oh brother Wade if you could just preach it different then we'd see it why don't you try getting in the spirit you get in the spirit and then you'll see it am if you can't get in the spirit you don't see nothing he said that's what they did on the day of Pentecost they all stay there and prayed till they got in the spirit now how' they get in the spirit I I believe I don't believe they were just sitting up there in the upper room like KN on a log or or as brother Brown would say a bump on a pickle but they were sitting up there and they began to think about God told us if we'll wait there's a promise he said wait until you are endued with power from on high and they got the thinking about that oh you starting to meditating on God's word and think about what he said and you're going to get in the spirit something will begin to take place when you begin to meditate on God's word they all stayed there and prayed till they got in the spirit and then got filled with the Holy Ghost and run out and act like a bunch of drunk people that's right they got in the spirit you know that's what prayer does prayer prayer when you go through your work day and all you hear all the negativity at work and maybe all the negativity from from from family members and everything then you just get along with God and you start aligning your thoughts with what he said and you begin to speak it back and let him speak to you and you ain't thinking about the stuff that your coworker told you but you're thinking about what God Said and you begin to you begin to meditate on him and oh that's when something begins to take place why cuz you're getting in the spirit you're getting in the spirit of worship you're getting in the spirit of praise and you begin to pray and you begin to thank God for what he's done and thank him for what you know he's going to do and thank him for word and you begin to praise God in the private of your own prayer closet that's when you begin to get in the spirit and when you begin to get in the spirit something's going to happen he said you know that's what's the matter with the church today it don't get in the spirit enough we're too much in ourselves my if you'll just get out of yourself long enough you say well you know our church is we we have a regular routine ain't that our problem tonight we got this routine that we got to we got to do everything we got to just sing so many songs and do so much and then go out to eat and everything but all when the spirit comes when the spirit comes you're going to get out of your routine when the spirit begins to break loose and people begin to praise God it don't matter so much about rushing out to go eat something does it it don't matter so much about rushing out to go sit at somebody's house when the spirit begins to move in the meeting when you begin to praise God and really break loose and something begins to happen and somebody get begins to get delivered then all that matters is God in you CA you in love with god oh if God could take us back to where to our first love take us back to where it really missant something to us that's what brother B said the matter with us is he said we're too much in ourselves if you'll just get out of yourself long enough well you know our churches we got a regular routine who cares about your routine that's what brother R said y'all believe brother Brown was a prophet who cares about your routine I wish you'd get out of the rout routine long enough to get saved anyhow get saved get out of the routine we don't care about the routine get in the spirit then you can see things done now you can't do any good this is another quote the brother R said you can't do any good until first you get in the spirit God can't use you all your efforts are in vain until first you do it in the spirit so think about that that you ain't going to do no good to yourself or others or your relationship with God until you first get in the spirit you've got to get in the spirit oh to get in the spirit means that you come to the house of God expecting to receive you're going to get what you expect if you come to the house of God expecting to come expecting to criticize and say well I don't like how this was framed up and I don't like how this was said and done well all you'll go away with is a lot of things a long list of things that you didn't like but if you'll come to the house of God God expecting to receive a blessing you'll get it cuz why cuz you're getting in the spirit you're getting in the spirit of worship and praise come expecting to get a blessing and come expecting to hear from God and come expecting to worship come expecting to see your life changed come expected to encourage and be encouraged you got to want to be here that's what that's what getting in the spirit means you got to want to be here you got to like it you've got to like being in church brother R said things begin to happen when men get in the spirit business takes place now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit how's these Revelations going to ever come to you get in the spirit how you ever going to get the Holy Ghost get in the spirit get in the spirit get in the spirit say Lord Jesus I love you now reveal to me anything that you see fit just bring it into me then you're getting all right that's right that's the way he said that's the way you you get a Revival it's when you really get in the spirit of Revival not whipping it up or something but by praying it down until there was there's a Revival strikes your heart until all the logs of ecclesiasticism and all the logs of fanaticism and all the logs of systems and all the logs of unbelief flows out and then the Waters of God comes falling down upon you there you are he said he's here tonight amen do you believe that that's what brother Ram's asking what do you have to do get in the spirit and when you get in the spirit then you see the vision amen now that's what so many of us fail to realize that God is here he's you say well I don't I've seen listen I've seen so many times you'll watch you'll watching a meeting there'll be somebody sitting in the congregation even while you're preaching somebody tears streaming down their face and right next to them there'll be somebody fast asleep with their head leaning up against the wall or whatever somebody will be getting a breakthrough and somebody else won't realize anything's going on why cuz one's in the spirit and one ain't realizing what's happening I've seen I've seen time after time you go uh somebody raise up and begin to praise God and maybe run through the church and somebody will be over to the side just sleep acting like they don't know what's going on but if we could just if we could just awaken from our spiritual Amnesia and realize that God is here God is here all the all this necessary if you could just get in the spirit oh if we could just fall in love with god brother said get in the spirit of this meeting and every one of you be healed in the name of Jesus Christ now there's a nice incentive for you to get in the spirit that if you get in the spirit you'll receive your healing if you get what does that mean you sit there and you think it's not available to you and that the preacher don't care about you and that all we're doing is just kind of going through some formality and things but if you'll get in the spirit and realize it's available to you and begin to think about the promises of God and begin to think that God loves you then you're something is going to happen to get in the spirit of something means to actively engage in and embrace the mood the atmosphere or the mindset associated with a particular event occasion or activity it involves adopting the appropriate attitude enthusiasm and part anticipation to fully immerse oneself in the experience oh now that means that means to really get in the spirit then you start getting them blinders on well you don't care if somebody sees you say Amen you don't care if somebody sees you what whatever run up down the aisle or if if the spirit strikes you and it's time to praise God and say God deliver me well you don't care CZ now you're just in your own little world with it's you and God Alone you're fully immersed in the experience of worship that's what we come here tonight to worship God that's what we come here tonight to receive something from him getting in the spirit implies actively aligning yourself with the essence and mood of a particular event occasion or activity and participating in a way that reflects its values Traditions or objectives now that's the formal definition that's not brother Brown's definition that's a definition that you can go look in the dictionary and see that's what it means to get in the spirit now see see how you maybe you've heard growing up you've heard of preacher said well you got to do this or that to get in the spirit no you just got to be willing to immerse yourself in the experience it's not whether you jump up or shout or whether you cry or whether you say Amen a hundred times during the service but just get in the spirit of worship come on now teach teach it what teaching positionally places you so let's just really lay it out how can I get in the spirit here's some guidelines how can I really get in the spirit prepare yourself spiritually take time to pray and meditate on the word of God and reflect on it with your heart and your mind cuz if you ain't reading your Bible in you're a long time if you're not studying the scripture if you're not if you're not reading the message if it's just Gathering dust on yourself you're not getting in the spirit seek to cultivate a receptive and open mindset and invite the presence of God to work in your life every morning when you wake up you just say your morning prayer do like your mama taught you when you were a little kid and at night before you lay your head on your pillow spend some spend some time start five minutes praying to God and that five minutes will grow until until you're really getting in the spirit dress appropriately when you go to a ball game the ball team is dressed appropriately for the event and when you come to church you're going to dress according to getting in the spirit of worship you're dress you're dressing like everybody else in the church does not not just because everybody else is doing it but you're dressing for the event if you're go if you go to a dance people are going to dress for danc and if you go to a ball game they're dressing for for a ball game but we dress because we're here to worship God and so to worship God to really are into a state of worship with God you're dressing the way he told us to we're dressing for our destination we're dressing we're dressing for our future home we're dressing because he told us to clothe oursel ouro our soul is clothed and our outward appearance is clothed with a righteousness and when you when if you really want to get in the spirit you got to participate in worship you've got to actively engage in the worship portion of a meeting in other that means that means that when people are singing along with hymns and choruses that you don't just sit there with your mouth closed and say well I'm not doing it I'm not singing I I don't think that I sing really good but you you because you want to get in the spirit of worship you're going to open up your mouth and you're going to sing praises to God because that's what we do in church we're here to worship you're going to sing and you're going to clap your hands and you're going to raise your hands and praise God and say Amen cuz that's how you get into worship oh now come on now y'all know that's the truth y'all know these things that I'm saying are not just to be hateful but these things are to be a blessing to you to to encourage you so that you can really you can really praise God and worship the way he wants you to oh God has given us the liberty to be able to think that when we raise our hands it's it's to give him praise and worship and honor and thankfulness for bringing us out of our carnality and the way that we used to we've got something to worship he's given us a word and an understanding in this day that we should we should have more than enough to worship him for you know another way that you can enter get in the spirit is to listen to the preaching pay attention to the sermon pay attention to the Sunday School lesson whoever it is giving the message listen to it listen to brother brandom at home listen to what he said take notes when you're when you're in church take notes and write things down and think about what's being said and be receptive to the teaching if you're sitting there you know saying well I it ain't for me and I don't care I don't like that and all those kind of things that's not getting in the spirit but seek if you come with a with a heart that's willing to seek and apply the principles to your life and grow and let these things be edified to you then you're going to be you're going to be getting in the spirit oh if you listen to the preaching prepare spirit spiritually dress for the occasion participate in worship listen to the preaching I'm talking about really listening let it let it soak down in my heart oh something that I can hang on to I listen a real sheep wants to be fed a real sheep wants that word and seek personal experience seek a personal experience with god oh it's not enough to get in the spirit to just once a week once W Wednesday night or on Sunday morning to just come to church and that's it no you got to have a personal experience for yourself you got to have a burning bush experience for your own self On The Backs side of the desert you and God where you see that God is real and that's that's getting in the spirit oh you got to you got to be open to experience a spiritual manifestation in your life you got to be constantly looking for God to find your car keys and find your wallet and help with your lost children and give peace to your family and looking for miracles in your life and praying over your wife laying there in the bed when she's got an ache in her pain and asking her to pray for you and constantly looking for God to do something in your own life oh that's getting in the spirit constantly day by day everywhere you place your feet that through the day you're looking for God to do something it is essential to approach all these experiences with discernment and in accordance with your own beliefs and comfort level just you got to you got to constantly be seeking personal experience and you got to engage with your community it's not enough to just come to church and say well I don't want to talk to nobody I don't want to some of the some of the greatest spiritual blessings that I've had is being able to get get counsel and advice from some of the older people in church younger people too it don't matter you we're sharpening one one another is iron sharpens iron and if you really want to get in this spirit that you Fellowship one with another and you you break bread one with another and you want to you want to be around other believers and I tell you if you really get a real revelation of the body of Christ that we are really really more family than maybe your natural [Applause] family I I say my my wife and I the other day we were talking about it we were in different places in the house and it's like it just struck us both at the same time how much we love our church and how much and I'm not just saying this to make a good talking point but it just really just hit us that this is our family and why is it our family because this is the it's the spirit of God moving in the people it's the spirit of God that's uniting us and oh you see you see that kind of thing when you start meditating on that you getting in the spirit and what's that going to do with your relationship with God it's going to start you make to love one another more it's going to make you enter into prayer more for for the other person because now it's not just somebody else there at church just some old or young person or somebody else there that you just see at church but it's your brother or sister it's somebody that means something to you and there you getting in the spirit what you're not just love it how can you love God if you don't love your brother but if you can if you really love God and you see you start seeing things different that'll make you talk to your brother and sister different that'll make you enter in different because you don't see him was just another another whatever but it's God tabernacling himself in that person in that vessel and you're fellowshipping not with just somebody else like a coworker at work but you're fellowshipping with god oh I I hope these things are a blessing to you that you can see how that you can if you this will give you something concrete to apply to your life that tomorrow morning when you get up give it give some alone time to God and you'll you'll get the day and the week started off right on Sunday Morning open up your Bible and begin to pray and think about things before you come to church think about how much you love God and how much you want to serve him how much you want God to take away the things of the world and get in the spirit of worship and when you come to church things will be different it won't just be another day where you can just check it off of your list but if you'll get in the spirit because the spirit is what gives life the spirit is the open door the spirit is Christ and made manifest in the members this is a living gospel a Living Word proving that Jesus Christ is [Applause] alive if we keep going on to verse two immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven you'll find out that the whole rest of this chapter is about the spirit of God his life in you his life in the bride looking at those four cre creatures the power of God in the bride the power of God in you God's sitting on his throne but but he's sitting on the throne of your heart and he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and A Shard and stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne throne in sight like unto an emerald and brother BR said in other words when you looked at him he was in such Splendor such beauty oh I want to see him oh I want to see him don't you is what brother Ram said those stones the first was Ruben the last was Benjamin the burst Stone of Reuben was Jasper and we talked about this last time that talking about a process that God takes you through he's the author and finisher he's the author of your faith and your finisher and he's taking you through a journey and those stones were typ in a spiritual journey that he was the first and the last he was from Benjamin to Reuben from Reuben to Benjamin and all those stones typified like they they represented the burst stones of the children of Israel that when you placed them into the breastplate of the priest and then a prophet spoke you could tell whether that prophet's word was true or not so then you apply that to your own life and that if you if you place yourself positionally in the word of God and let a prophet speak over your life that you become the actual Vindication of that prophet's message so you sitting out here the life that you live and the word that you have received become the Vindication of that prophet's message your life is the very Vindication the very Vindication to oh we were preaching on this last time when people see the life that you live and the way that you react to situations it becomes a living testimony when they see how you love and how you don't rile back and how you're patient with others and how you don't just lose control and get in a rant how you don't just berate somebody that gets on your nerves how you don't just crush somebody that that that says something that you don't like but the love of Christ is in you to be able to forgive oh you think about the gift of the Holy Ghost that God has given us to be able to forgive somebody to forgive somebody that's a gift that the world don't have cuz the world will hold a grudge forever and ever they'll be like an elephant that won't forget but the Holy Ghost gives you power to be able to forgive to be able to fellowship with somebody that Did You Wrong that treated you wrong years ago or maybe yesterday but the Holy Ghost in you can forgive just like Jesus did on his on the cross when he said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing to be kind and longsuffering oh when the prophet's word spoke across those stones the light flashed and it was the very Vindication of his message and the fruit in you the life in you actually vindicates the message that you've heard the fruit vindicates the tree you got to have the life on display I'm skipping through some of the I I I really don't want to keep you late tonight I'm I'm trying to I'm not I'm I'm not going to do that the life is what listen if you want people to respect you the life is what people will respect the world is looking for some for that life to be on this play they're looking for somebody that when they're wronged they're not going to lash back now that's what the stature of a perfect man is for the per stature of a perfect man is to bring us to a place where you react the way that God would to a situation like brother Brandon when he was standing there preaching and there was that couple sitting there kissing on one another but love took over and he didn't just crush them under his thumb he didn't just just speak a word to kill them but he spoke love out oh that's what the world is looking for somebody they're looking for a mother and father that'll react with love to their children a a mother and father they'll speak love back and maybe if their kids are going out in the world that to speak love and say no matter where you go or what you do I'll always love you I'll always be here for you I don't care where you go I'll love you now oh if you can do that that's life on display the life is what the M makes the demons tremble and you know real love brother R said over over and over love is what casts out a devil if you can love somebody like that little woman that her husband come home drunk with all of his friends and she just sat there must Jesus bear the cross alone and love is what changed the situation love is what cast out love is what cast out that devil when when that man came up to hit brother brandom in the face and and he fell across his feet why CU love took over you oh love love is the greatest thing when a bull came to brother Bram and he spoke love he confronted it with love not with not with a gun not with a revolver not with telling them how how little they were how how how how much I disrespect you and all these kind of things but love love is the thing that'll win the day it's the life that's why in John saw he said it there was a rainbow round about the throne and sight like unto an emerald and brother what does that Emerald represent this greenish what does green represent life life the life of God the life of God is on the throne of your heart the life of God is tabernacled in you oh if we could recognize that in oursel and in our brothers things will be and our sisters things will be different oh the picture the picture of that life the picture of that life that John was looking at is a Vindication of this message you to think now that that life that that light that John was looking at we can see there in the picture of over brother brandham that hangs on our walls and that same light is now dwelling in the heart of every believer to identify you with what John saw I got all these quotes I'm I'm a let's see I'm going scam through some of these he said and who do you say this is he said Lord we know it's you it's Jesus Christ and the person of the Holy Ghost and we see the great Pillar of Fire Among Us Lord the same as they did in the first part of the Bible with Moses we seen it in the middle of the Bible when Paul was on his road to Damascus we see it now here we see it at the end time again three is a confirmation it's been the message each time it's the same Lord Jesus made flesh in his people anointing his word for the bride and the message of Grace he said now Jesus Christ dwells in the people one day Christ was in a pillar of fire that one you see taken and we believe it to be Jehovah God that's what the angel was trying to get to us now he was and the father who had then he was the father of Israel and Nation then he came and dwelt among his people as Christ the son Christ was the son of God now he's Christ the Holy Spirit which is the anointing Christ means the anointing and the anointed one upon the people Christ with us the holy spirit it's Christ with us in US you believe that it's it's the life in you the life in the church that's why Abel offered blood because it was life it was about life life was the ransom from death and Christ gave his blood to give us life that's the attraction when the world sees the Life of Christ and you it attracts them to something they want to know more about it like like the burning bush that turned Moses aside now oh you think about this scene that John was looking at as we go through this this study the scene that John was looking at brother Bram identified it with the same thing that Ezekiel Saw back there in Ezekiel chapter 1 when it says that Ezekiel looked he said I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire infolding itself all you think about this picture the fire like you look into a campfire and the fire is just infold going in itself and rolling and boiling and it fire and folding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof is the color of amber there's that same color that same color that was at that Pillar of Fire over brother brandham the same thing that John's looking at the same life that's in you is what Ezekiel was looking at is what John was looking at out of the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and brother Ram said I want you to look at that just exactly what Ezekiel Saw same colors the same color the same way and acted the same same way and flush the same way he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same today as he was back there when Ezekiel Saw that light he acts the same way he behaves the same way CU it's the same life he said what is it the living creatures represents the Living Church oh it's life it's the Life of Christ in you and you're powered by what the four creatures represent he said the church that's living by the power and the resurrection of Christ that's what those living creatures represent them same Amber colors has covered it from the loins upward from the loins downward the same light that Ezekiel Saw is in you that same light that John saw is in you the same light that was with the prophet in is in you he has ought to think about that tonight as we're as we're closing here in just a minute he has covered you he's covered you he's anointed you with his power he has filled you with his light with that same light that Ezekiel Saw he has filled you with his life and he did it why did he do it because he promised he would do it in Revelation 4:3 it says he he that sat was was to look upon as a Jasper and a sarden stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and brother BR said that round about that Circle means that he promised he would do it it means he said the reason he was surrounded with that Circle Bowl of green amber color that life was because he said he is a covenant keeping God he will keep his Covenant he he promised he would give you that life he promised he would give it to you I'll be closing here in just a moment yeah it makes me nervous as the clock ticks around and I know people are getting tired in Genesis 9 when when God gave that promise to Noah it says and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and I'll remember my Covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of All Flesh and the wat shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh now brother R said the Covenant was life for Noah that he spared him he he kept Noah alive the Covenant was was Al for Noah but the Covenant that God made with himself was a rainbow and that's what John was looking at a rainbow round about the throne and in emerald in color and he said a covenant then is a token a token of what now now brother R said you go back to the previous chapter in Genesis 8 and Noah built an altar with the Lord and He sacrificed he made a sacrifice and God he said the Lord smelled a sweet saver and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground so so God put that bow in the sky as a token that I've accepted the sacrifice now see that token that that that bow that John's looking at is a symbol that God has accepted the sacrifice that was made for you oh you see what a great picture this is that this picture when this this story this picture becomes begins to unfold to us it gives us confidence and who we are that the life that that the life of God is made manif in us what does it mean brother Bram said that God has promised God promised he said he also takes his oath and swears by himself that's what Paul was talking about in Hebrews 6 that God confirmed it by an oath it by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation and When God Says something you know God he's he's going to back up his word you can you can just hang everything on on every promise of God he said said God and His seven colored rainbow his Covenant that he made a covenant through seven Church ages the seven Church colors that he would save the Earth he promised he would do it let let's stop there the musicians can go ahead and come forward he promised he would do it he has proven his promise in you the very light and the power of God is reflecting in his church that proves that he keeps his promise the very light and power that's in you is proven that he keeps his promise oh do doesn't that just make you feel good as we stand to our feet that the life that you're living proves that he keeps his promise as you walk amongst your co-workers at work and with you with your maybe you got unbelieving family members the life that you live proves that God keeps his promise we've got a covenant keeping God now as we close the service remember now we've got a covenant keeping God so if you have any need you you're welcome to come up and seek prayer and we'll pray for you and we'll believe with you because we've got a covenant keeping God we've got a God that when he makes a promise he comes and backs it up all you got to do is get in the spirit begin to meditate on what he said believe what he said and thank God for it and you'll see something happen let's worship him you love the Lord tonight you you thank God for his word and what he's done for us in this hour amen if that same spirit that raised up
