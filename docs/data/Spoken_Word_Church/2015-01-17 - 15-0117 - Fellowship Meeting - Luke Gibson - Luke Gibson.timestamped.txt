[28:40] some of us have come through some hard
[28:41] knots to get here but God's had us here

[28:49] full extent of it but I want to push on
[28:52] out and do more this year than they did
[28:55] last year praise God Amen and I thought

[29:21] direction and it's just kind of just
[29:23] shared a little quick
[29:25] testimony um when we

[40:41] amen praise the Lord the
[40:46] Lord how many love Jesus amen I came
[40:50] here to worship Jesus I was thinking
[40:53] about um this scripture
[40:55] here in Matthew Matthew
[40:58] 24 I've been reading a lot of news these
[41:01] days and
[41:03] um is they have a different
[41:06] captions and this Matthew chapter 24
[41:09] here I want to read this verse
[41:13] 6 and he said ye shall hear of wars and
[41:18] rumors of
[41:19] wars say that ye be not troubled oh oh
[41:23] yeah for all these things
[41:27] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[41:32] amen and so this the spirit of God just
[41:37] moved me and I see so many things taking
[41:41] place we all see it yeah amen the French
[41:44] world is divided into half two half all
[41:46] right they have the one group they call
[41:50] them the uh the French people they said
[41:52] you see Charlie everywhere you look at
[41:56] it and another group they call it yesu
[42:00] Muhammad and I was thinking about it I
[42:02] said Lord then what about
[42:05] us and I don't understand French a lot
[42:08] but the letter I know the spirit of God
[42:12] just uh put on my heart
[42:14] yes
[42:17] lius that means that I am the bride
[42:21] amen and so when the world is divided
[42:24] one side is for Charlie group yes that
[42:27] cause so many things and the Islam
[42:31] Muhammad group the killing Christians
[42:35] lot of churches are burned
[42:38] up and because the Lord has already
[42:41] spoken about these things that these
[42:44] things will take place
[42:46] first but the prophet of God said if you
[42:48] don't pray the game according to the
[42:50] rules you're going to lose that's right
[42:53] and we find that they they already
[42:55] disqualified
[42:57] because they are not playing the game
[42:59] according to the rules of these holy
[43:02] scriptures and so we are very thankful
[43:04] that the Lord send this message all
[43:07] right and we can give up we have to
[43:10] press our way because this message is
[43:12] vanic we know he's the truth and uh we

[58:02] stumbling over each other and all the
[58:05] saints gathering around throughout my
[58:08] serving God I'm just so honored you know
[58:11] we're called to a special walk in this
[58:13] day this is a walk that's not compared
[58:16] with any other in the days of Moses god
[58:19] anointed Moses to get people Faith to
[58:21] walk on land and they couldn't hardly do
[58:24] it but just Caleb and a few others
[58:26] then Along Comes Jesus he preached tried
[58:29] to get people to Faith to walk on water
[58:33] you know Peter did it a little bit a few
[58:35] others did it just a little
[58:36] bit but not so many and now in this day
[58:40] God's called us to walk on the air he
[58:43] truly has he's asked us to have faith to
[58:45] to catch a Rapture to meet the Lord
[58:47] Jesus in the air amen that's what this
[58:50] message is and there's a way to do it
[58:52] the Bible says that he'd give the
[58:53] five-fold ministry for the perfecting of
[58:55] the Saints
[58:57] until we all come into that unity and
[58:59] this is God's way it's God's way whether
[59:02] we like it or not and me I like
[59:06] it oh hold on a
[59:09] second yeah yeah yeah everything you do
[59:14] is being watched by the way world is
[59:16] watching amen I love this message it's
[59:20] giving us Faith to receive a Rapture
[59:23] there's never been another day like this
[59:26] I don't know if you realize that they
[59:27] are spending Millions to try to disprove
[59:30] the message the internet is filled with
[59:33] it now and yet the people walk in the
[59:36] days of Noah they tried and tried to
[59:39] disprove Noah and it looked like they
[59:41] were doing a good job and suddenly here
[59:43] comes the Lions and the wilderbeast
[59:45] walking together into the
[59:48] ark amen my they say we have nothing to
[59:52] go on in this message well nothing on
[59:53] this Earth you don't get the message
[59:56] from the earth you get the message from
[59:58] Heaven no they're right there is nothing
[1:00:00] on this Earth to prove the message it's
[1:00:02] all in Heavenly
[1:00:04] places this message will carry a people
[1:00:07] right out of this Earth You Know in the
[1:00:10] in the days of the Bible they had too
[1:00:12] big of an army and God was cutting the
[1:00:13] Army down always chopping it down to
[1:00:16] prove his greatness now to prove his
[1:00:18] greatness he's taken a very few people
[1:00:20] and anointing them with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:22] to preach to others to sing to others to
[1:00:24] mother or to father over them and now he
[1:00:27] has and wants a many membered bride oh
[1:00:30] yeah Amen in in order to be a Navy SEAL
[1:00:32] you have to to earn the qualifications
[1:00:35] through great physical and mental
[1:00:37] exertion in order to be part of the the
[1:00:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ you you are
[1:00:43] you are given that by the great exertion
[1:00:46] and and and wonderfulness of Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ but it's still self-will whether
[1:00:51] you will do it that's right amen and
[1:00:53] there is an entrance way you know in the
[1:00:55] days of David there was just I think 40
[1:00:57] mighty men in the Bible counts them
[1:01:00] right out and there's a little there's a
[1:01:01] little list but in this day he's calling
[1:01:04] many many more to be mighty men and
[1:01:06] women we've never had an opportunity
[1:01:09] like this in the history of this Earth
[1:01:11] to be such such
[1:01:13] uh such statues and and such pillars of
[1:01:18] faith the prophet of God said you can be
[1:01:20] like a solar system in this age you can
[1:01:22] be just as consistent as the Moon is
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:26] my what a wonderful thing and the
[1:01:28] entrance way to this Divine faith in
[1:01:31] this day is through the hearing of the
[1:01:32] word of God it is the doctrine of this
[1:01:34] last day message which was the anointing
[1:01:37] of the Lord Jesus that will prepare a
[1:01:39] people for a Rapture and The Holy Bible
[1:01:41] says that it will be the five-fold
[1:01:43] ministry the pastors the the teachers
[1:01:45] the evangelists the it the five-fold
[1:01:48] that will uh perfect the people is it
[1:01:51] them personally no it's the words
[1:01:52] they're saying amen my words are life
[1:01:55] Jesus said amen so I can't wait for the
[1:02:00] word there's a holy presence here today
[1:02:03] do you want your life to change just
[1:02:05] receive the word amen do you want to
[1:02:07] walk as the Immortals walked in the days
[1:02:09] of the Bible where we just can't talk
[1:02:11] enough about the widow woman we can't
[1:02:13] talk enough about you know David and his
[1:02:15] sling we can't talk enough about do you
[1:02:17] want to be one of them then walk with
[1:02:20] the word and what an opportunity amen
[1:02:22] amen you'll get out of a service what
[1:02:24] you expect we're exp in great things I
[1:02:27] drove all these Miles because I'm
[1:02:29] expecting great things amen I'm more
[1:02:32] more convinced of the truth of this
[1:02:34] message than ever before you know the
[1:02:36] prophet of God says unless controversy
[1:02:38] surrounds this message it's false come
[1:02:41] on and we're worried about a little bit
[1:02:43] of
[1:02:43] controversy when our lord Jesus had the
[1:02:46] same controversy when Moses had the same
[1:02:48] controversy When anybody who's ever done
[1:02:50] anything has great controversy following
[1:02:52] them what an honor it is I'm not just
[1:02:56] barely in the message I am the
[1:02:59] message no the the Revival hasn't died
[1:03:02] in the message because I'm still here
[1:03:04] all
[1:03:05] right amen I stand as a product of God's
[1:03:09] grace just love it can't wait to hear
[1:03:12] the word Can't
[1:03:14] Wait nothing can separate us from this
[1:03:18] nothing can separate you from the love
[1:03:20] of God in Christ Jesus and if you can
[1:03:22] recognize it the love of Christ Jesus is
[1:03:24] in this message
[1:03:26] don't kid yourself it's not in the
[1:03:28] denominations while we're learning to
[1:03:30] walk on air they're still trying to
[1:03:31] figure out how many gods there
[1:03:33] are I'm sorry God bless their hearts and
[1:03:36] I hope they come to further Revelations
[1:03:38] while we are learning to receive the
[1:03:40] engrafted word and to to produce Christ
[1:03:43] manifested because of that anointing
[1:03:45] they are trying to figure out if all of
[1:03:47] this Bible's inspired oh yeah well we
[1:03:50] know all the Bible's inspired and some
[1:03:52] even around the message are trying to
[1:03:53] figure out if the prophet's message was
[1:03:55] all Inspire on oh catch the
[1:03:59] vision the further they went with Noah
[1:04:02] the better off they were all right the
[1:04:04] further they went with Paul the better
[1:04:06] off they were further we go with this
[1:04:08] message the better off we are amen we'll
[1:04:12] get out of this service what whatever we
[1:04:15] put into it what if we all knew the end
[1:04:18] would be tomorrow morning we would pull
[1:04:20] so hard on brother Luke Gibson that he'd
[1:04:22] have gray hair like brother Homer by the
[1:04:24] time he was done
[1:04:27] What If today was the last day oh yeah I
[1:04:30] still remember this day a long time ago
[1:04:32] maybe 18 years ago when a Baptist man
[1:04:35] received the revelation of the correct
[1:04:37] baptism and he was baptized and he come
[1:04:39] to one message service and at the end he
[1:04:42] come up for prayer because he wasn't
[1:04:44] feeling real good I say brother did you
[1:04:45] believe everything you heard preach he
[1:04:46] says I I believed it all I says you
[1:04:49] received his name I received his name I
[1:04:51] says well praise the Lord then don't
[1:04:52] worry you're healed the next day he died
[1:04:55] you know what he was healed he received
[1:04:56] the word and I don't feel bad for
[1:04:59] him I don't feel bad for anybody and I
[1:05:01] don't feel sorry for you when you go
[1:05:03] through things you're going through
[1:05:04] we're supposed to go through things it
[1:05:06] identifies you you can't walk on the air
[1:05:09] unless you slug through the
[1:05:11] mud it's just a part of it it actually
[1:05:14] identifies you when people persecute you
[1:05:16] for what you
[1:05:17] believe it actually identifies you when
[1:05:20] you're the only one with a conscience
[1:05:21] when you do wrong that identifies you as
[1:05:23] being a living Soul yeah praise the
[1:05:27] Lord oh I could say a whole lot of
[1:05:30] things
[1:05:31] today just

[1:22:41] so you just pray for me the Lord help me
[1:22:43] amen Mark chapter 2 I want to begin with
[1:22:47] verse
[1:22:48] 13 and I want to read down to verse
[1:22:51] 20 mark 2:3 13 and he speaking of Jesus
[1:22:56] went forth again by the seaside and all
[1:23:00] the multitude resorted unto him and he
[1:23:03] taught them and as he passed by he saw
[1:23:06] Levi the son of alfus sitting at the
[1:23:09] receip of custom and said unto him
[1:23:11] follow me and he arose and followed him
[1:23:15] and it came to pass that as Jesus sat at
[1:23:17] meat in his house many publicans and
[1:23:20] sinners sat also together with Jesus and
[1:23:23] his dis deciples for there were many and
[1:23:26] they followed him and when the scribes
[1:23:29] and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
[1:23:32] and sinners they said unto his disciples
[1:23:35] how is it that he eateth and drinketh
[1:23:37] with publicans and Sinners and when
[1:23:40] Jesus heard it he saith unto him they
[1:23:43] that are whole have no need of a
[1:23:46] physician but they that are sick I came
[1:23:49] not to call the righteous but Sinners to
[1:23:52] repentance and The Disciples of of John
[1:23:55] and of the Pharisees used to fast and
[1:23:58] they come and said unto him why do the
[1:24:01] Disciples of John and of the Pharisees
[1:24:04] fast but thy disciples fast not and
[1:24:09] Jesus said unto them can the children of
[1:24:12] the Bride chamber fast while the
[1:24:14] bridegroom is with them as long as they
[1:24:18] have the bridegroom with them they
[1:24:20] cannot fast but the days will come when
[1:24:23] the bridegroom shall be taken away from
[1:24:26] them then shall they fast in those days
[1:24:30] let's just bow our head for a moment of
[1:24:32] prayer and on my way here I got a call
[1:24:35] from uh home about a brother that

[1:25:29] you'd touch him now Lord we pray oh God
[1:25:31] that you just move in this service these
[1:25:34] next few moments May the Holy Spirit
[1:25:36] take the word of God now and open it to
[1:25:39] our hearts we pray in the name of the
[1:25:41] Lord Jesus Christ and the church says
[1:25:44] amen God bless you you may be seated I
[1:25:47] certainly appreciate the testimonies
[1:25:49] that we heard and I want to just take my
[1:25:52] stand with our brothers to say that I
[1:25:54] Believe by God's grace we have a perfect
[1:25:57] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:26:00] Vindication amen I I certainly do not
[1:26:03] listen to this message to find fault
[1:26:05] with it I listen to it because I believe
[1:26:07] it's almighty God that came down in this
[1:26:09] hour amen I do not believe that this
[1:26:12] message is the thoughts of William
[1:26:14] brandom expressed I believe it's the
[1:26:16] thoughts of almighty God expressed
[1:26:18] through William brandom amen so we
[1:26:20] certainly appreciate the Lord for that I
[1:26:23] always have a problem with a man that
[1:26:24] says brother bam was a prophet uh but
[1:26:27] then he went off the word I don't know
[1:26:29] how in the world what kind of prophet
[1:26:30] they have but a prophet is a Divine
[1:26:33] interpreter of the word of God so I
[1:26:35] certainly believe that amen so we sure
[1:26:38] appreciate the Lord and I've got a hurry
[1:26:39] brother Homer told me I got 30 minutes
[1:26:41] so I'm going to obey the pastor amen
[1:26:45] so in our text this afternoon we find
[1:26:49] that Jesus is in the center of
[1:26:52] controversy once again
[1:26:56] it's kind of amazing that Jesus seems to
[1:26:59] be consistently in
[1:27:02] controversy with a certain crowd in his
[1:27:06] day and Jesus's problem with the
[1:27:09] controversy was not with Sinners but it
[1:27:13] was always with the religious
[1:27:16] crowd specifically speaking this
[1:27:18] afternoon the scribes and the
[1:27:22] Pharisees because they were on one end
[1:27:25] of the spectrum and Jesus represented
[1:27:27] another end of the
[1:27:29] spectrum Jesus represented
[1:27:32] Grace Jesus represented truth Jesus
[1:27:36] represented Liberty the Pharisees
[1:27:40] represented law they represented
[1:27:44] Traditions they represented bondage so
[1:27:47] they were on two different ends of the
[1:27:49] spectrum it's amazing that the sinner is
[1:27:52] not what ever ever gave Jesus his
[1:27:55] problem it was always the religious
[1:27:57] crowd that gave Jesus his problem Jesus
[1:28:01] seemed at different times would be in
[1:28:03] the he would always have to stand in the
[1:28:05] middle of the of the religious crowd in
[1:28:08] the center brother bam said it was The
[1:28:11] Sinner that gave Jesus his
[1:28:14] reputation Jesus came into this world to
[1:28:17] be a savior so whenever he met a sinner
[1:28:21] he met someone that actually could make
[1:28:23] up his reputation
[1:28:25] we find in John chapter 8 for a minute
[1:28:28] that they brought a woman that had been
[1:28:29] caught in the act of adultery and
[1:28:32] there's no question to me that she was
[1:28:34] caught in that act that's probably the
[1:28:36] truth she was caught in that act but
[1:28:38] what's always strange to me is when
[1:28:41] those men brought that woman to Jesus my
[1:28:44] question has always been was where was
[1:28:46] the
[1:28:48] man where was the man and I've upten
[1:28:51] wondered if the man may have been one of
[1:28:53] the children what of their sons but
[1:28:57] Jesus stood there and the scripture says
[1:29:00] that he knelt down and he wrote
[1:29:01] something in the sand and whenever he
[1:29:03] wrote In The Sand the scripture said one
[1:29:05] by one from the eldest to the youngest
[1:29:09] they walked away and when Jesus lifted
[1:29:12] his head he said woman where is thy
[1:29:15] accusers she said I don't have any
[1:29:17] accusers he said neither do I condemn
[1:29:21] thee but go and sin no more Jesus didn't
[1:29:25] come to condemn The Sinner Jesus Come To
[1:29:28] Save The
[1:29:29] Sinner can you say Amen it wasn't the
[1:29:32] sinner that crucified Christ it was the
[1:29:35] religious crowd that crucified Christ
[1:29:38] it's the religious crowd that's always
[1:29:40] had the problem with the word they
[1:29:42] didn't have the problem with the
[1:29:44] tradition they had the problem with the
[1:29:46] word and Jesus was the word made flesh
[1:29:49] for that hour can you say Amen the very
[1:29:53] God think about about this the very God
[1:29:56] that the scribes and Pharisees claimed
[1:29:58] they believed in the very book that they
[1:30:01] read from that very God that they claim
[1:30:05] they believed in was standing in front
[1:30:07] of them in a human Veil and they failed
[1:30:11] to recognize who it was they claimed
[1:30:13] they believed the god the Bible but what
[1:30:16] they didn't realize was the god that
[1:30:18] they came to believe in became flesh and
[1:30:20] was dwelling right among them and they
[1:30:22] failed to recognize who he
[1:30:25] was it was always the religious crowd
[1:30:29] that Jesus had his problems
[1:30:31] with we find first of all in the text
[1:30:35] they had a problem with who Jesus was
[1:30:37] eating
[1:30:39] with said how is it that he eateth and
[1:30:43] drinketh with publicans and with
[1:30:46] Sinners that was their first problem is
[1:30:49] was who he was eating with so they
[1:30:52] confronted him concerning that but now
[1:30:55] the question arises that I want to
[1:30:56] present to you today is why Jesus was
[1:31:01] eating with this crowd the issue was not
[1:31:05] just who he was eating with but why he
[1:31:08] was eating with
[1:31:10] them Jesus ate with Sinners he ate with
[1:31:14] publicans and that was their first
[1:31:15] problem the second problem was why he
[1:31:19] ate with them and then they came to him
[1:31:22] always that religious I crowd seems to
[1:31:25] have and I'm not speaking anybody
[1:31:27] specifically here but that religious
[1:31:29] crowd always has that very arrogant
[1:31:32] Spirit to the word Jesus in my humble
[1:31:35] opinion was probably the most humblest
[1:31:37] man that ever lived he was God failed as
[1:31:41] a man one day they said to Jesus said
[1:31:44] John chapter 10 said thou being a man
[1:31:47] makest thyself God I got news for you
[1:31:50] Jesus was not a man making himself God
[1:31:54] he was God who made himself a man and
[1:31:57] the scripture said when he became a man
[1:31:59] he was found and fashion as a man he he
[1:32:02] became obedient under death even the
[1:32:05] death of the Cross Jesus came this Earth
[1:32:07] he didn't come as a know at all he come
[1:32:09] as a humble man but he was the word made
[1:32:12] flesh and dwelt among
[1:32:15] us but in our text I want to hurry with
[1:32:18] this Jesus is confronted with the
[1:32:21] Disciples of John the Baptist
[1:32:24] now you got to remember it was their man
[1:32:27] that introduced Christ so there was a
[1:32:30] group here that was caught between
[1:32:32] John's message and the coming Messiah
[1:32:37] there was a people that saw John as a
[1:32:40] prophet but couldn't see the prophecy
[1:32:43] fulfilled they saw the prophet that
[1:32:45] foran but they couldn't see the
[1:32:48] transition from the prophet to the
[1:32:50] prophecy now just hold on and watch this
[1:32:54] now it was not only the Disciples of
[1:32:55] John the Baptist but it was also the
[1:32:58] Pharisees and now the Pharisees were
[1:33:01] fair you
[1:33:03] see and they hung out with a crowd who
[1:33:06] was sad you
[1:33:08] see one crowd was
[1:33:11] self-righteous and they were very
[1:33:13] arrogant in that another crowd was very
[1:33:17] sad cuz they didn't believe in the
[1:33:19] supernatural angels of the resurrection
[1:33:21] and if I didn't believe in the
[1:33:22] Supernatural I'd be very sad today too
[1:33:26] if I didn't believe in the resurrection
[1:33:28] and I didn't believe in the Holy Ghost
[1:33:30] and I didn't believe the Pres of God was
[1:33:32] Among Us I'd be a very sad individual
[1:33:34] myself if I didn't believe that God
[1:33:37] still healed the sick God still cast out
[1:33:39] Devils God still gives people the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost if I didn't believe that I'd be a
[1:33:43] very sad individual today but I'm so
[1:33:45] glad there's still a group of people on
[1:33:47] the face of the Earth that believes he's
[1:33:49] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:33:52] believes what this Bible said it's still
[1:33:54] true today
[1:33:56] amen but they came to Jesus I'm sorry if
[1:33:59] I knocked that
[1:34:01] down I've had to pay for pre pull pits
[1:34:04] where I
[1:34:08] preached they had a problem with who
[1:34:11] Jesus hung out with well matter of fact
[1:34:13] they invited Jesus I've always thought
[1:34:16] it was strange how Jesus would pass
[1:34:17] through a place like Levi and speak to
[1:34:20] him rep Peter and speak to him and they
[1:34:21] drop their Nets and follow him
[1:34:24] man said at the receipt a custom he was
[1:34:26] a it was a I just say it he was a tax
[1:34:30] collector I've always wonder how in the
[1:34:32] world Tax Collectors get
[1:34:34] saved but Levi was a tax collector he
[1:34:37] drops what he's doing and he follows him
[1:34:39] you stud the scripture very closely the
[1:34:42] scripture said that Levi forsook all
[1:34:45] then rose up and followed Jesus I've
[1:34:48] always wondered how in the world did he
[1:34:49] he'd have to raise up first then forsake
[1:34:51] all but Levi turned loose of everything
[1:34:54] in his heart there was something about
[1:34:57] that call that voice maybe you can't
[1:35:01] explain it but you know that when God's
[1:35:03] voice spoke to you there's something in
[1:35:05] you brother listen there's not a man
[1:35:07] living today that can explain everything
[1:35:09] the Bible say explain everything the
[1:35:11] message said but there's something in
[1:35:13] our hearts that knows when we heard
[1:35:16] God's voice something in here was K to
[1:35:19] that voice brother when I heard these
[1:35:21] tapes the first time and 1988 and they
[1:35:25] played the serpent seed message to me I
[1:35:27] real didn't take me long to realize I
[1:35:29] was hearing more than a man it wasn't
[1:35:31] just William brandom it was God himself
[1:35:34] Val a man speaking to this
[1:35:37] age amen
[1:35:39] church so they came to Jes let me hurry
[1:35:41] they came to Jesus and said why is it
[1:35:44] now we know you eat with them why Jesus
[1:35:47] each with publicans and sinners but the
[1:35:50] question came up in verse 18 that the
[1:35:54] Disciples of John fast and the Pharisees
[1:35:58] fast and he said but thy disciples fast
[1:36:02] not now look brother if people are going
[1:36:06] to be critical they going to find if
[1:36:09] they listen if they can find something
[1:36:11] about Jesus to criticize they're
[1:36:13] certainly going to find something about
[1:36:15] this
[1:36:17] message if they can find something about
[1:36:19] our Lord who was God veiled in a man if
[1:36:22] they could criticize him certainly they
[1:36:24] would criticize Malachi 4 certainly they
[1:36:27] would criticize the children whose
[1:36:28] Hearts have been turned back to the
[1:36:30] faith of the apostolic
[1:36:33] fathers but Verse 18 says and The
[1:36:37] Disciples of John and of the Pharisees
[1:36:40] used to fast on let me let me get my
[1:36:42] thought in here quickly in the Greek
[1:36:44] language the ideal is
[1:36:46] this that they was observing a fast at
[1:36:50] that
[1:36:51] time and this is what is amazing
[1:36:54] very critical as long as they believe
[1:36:57] they're doing
[1:36:59] it and so they they were caring remember
[1:37:02] Jesus just come from Matthews where he
[1:37:04] feasted with the publicans and you know
[1:37:07] Levi which really is Matthew and here
[1:37:10] Jesus is there with the tax collector
[1:37:13] and the Publican he's sharing a meal
[1:37:16] with their his companions and his Cog
[1:37:19] Lees because Matthew was so convinced of
[1:37:22] who Jesus was he wanted others to
[1:37:25] hear This Man Called Jesus I don't know
[1:37:28] about you Brothers sister but when I
[1:37:29] heard this message I wanted everybody to
[1:37:31] believe this message matter of fact I
[1:37:33] believed that I was going to take this
[1:37:35] message to the Pentecostals and they
[1:37:37] would receive this message oh was I in a
[1:37:40] big for
[1:37:46] surprise but I thought I could you know
[1:37:48] why cuz brother B said when a man gets
[1:37:50] convinced about what he believes he gets
[1:37:53] concerned about other
[1:37:55] people our desire really is not to see
[1:37:57] anybody lost Jesus didn't want to see
[1:38:00] nobody lost the scripture said God
[1:38:02] didn't even desire to see anybody lost
[1:38:04] he desired that men would be saved
[1:38:07] Hallelujah we don't take pleasure in the
[1:38:10] fact that people go to hell matter of
[1:38:12] fact I don't even believe God sends
[1:38:14] people to hell I believe they send
[1:38:16] themselves to Hell by rejecting God's
[1:38:18] provided
[1:38:19] way do you believe that so the Pharisees
[1:38:23] here
[1:38:24] came to Jesus and wondered why are we
[1:38:28] fasting Disciples of John are fasting
[1:38:30] but you and your disciples are not
[1:38:34] fasting notice this but y'all's
[1:38:39] feasting this crowd now now fasting is
[1:38:42] very important we're going to see what
[1:38:43] it what what involves here because the
[1:38:45] only scriptural
[1:38:47] commandment by God that these Pharisees
[1:38:50] were really following was the practice
[1:38:53] of fasting once a year it was in the Old
[1:38:57] Testament called the day of atonement
[1:38:59] now remember their fasting under a
[1:39:03] type that's pointing to Future
[1:39:07] fulfillment and so they would fast once
[1:39:09] a year we call it Young compor when the
[1:39:12] Jews were uh commemorating the day when
[1:39:16] their sins were forgiven really they
[1:39:20] weren't they were
[1:39:22] covered but Faith they were looking for
[1:39:25] the day to come when the Forgiveness of
[1:39:28] sins would come now remember when they
[1:39:30] fasted under this uh day of atonement it
[1:39:35] was a day that their the scripture said
[1:39:38] it was the remembrance of
[1:39:40] sins every time they made an offering it
[1:39:45] would remind them of sin next year
[1:39:49] another sacrifice another remembrance of
[1:39:52] sins but if they could have only
[1:39:54] understood here stood a man that would
[1:39:58] wipe out the remembrance of sins where
[1:40:02] God would say thy sins and iniquities
[1:40:05] will I remember no more but let me just
[1:40:09] tell you this
[1:40:10] quickly it it is not
[1:40:12] really
[1:40:14] possible that a man or a woman said in
[1:40:17] this building could forget every sin
[1:40:20] they committed
[1:40:23] I can still tell you things I done but
[1:40:26] yet I believe that they're under the
[1:40:27] blood of Christ listen it ain't
[1:40:30] important what I remember and what I can
[1:40:33] forget it's important what he can
[1:40:36] remember and what he can forget and he
[1:40:39] said under the blood of Christ your sin
[1:40:42] your iniquity will I remember no more
[1:40:45] it's not about what I forget it's about
[1:40:48] what God
[1:40:52] forgets it got to the place that the
[1:40:56] Pharisees their fasting evolved to a
[1:40:59] place where they fasted twice a
[1:41:00] week once was Monday once was Thursday
[1:41:04] and they fasted from 6:00 a.m. to 6:
[1:41:06] p.m. and after 6:00 p.m. they could eat
[1:41:08] anything they wanted to eat now I come
[1:41:11] out of a Pentecostal church we fasted
[1:41:13] every week we fasted seven days 21 days
[1:41:17] 28 days 40 days I even shaved my head
[1:41:20] one time and won't ever do that again
[1:41:26] laid in a room in sackcloth and Ashes
[1:41:28] burnt newspaper rubbed it on my head
[1:41:31] fasting trying to find now look you just
[1:41:34] watch where this goes we're fasting for
[1:41:36] something asking God for something that
[1:41:39] was standing right in front of
[1:41:45] us fasting was
[1:41:47] mning feasting meant there's a
[1:41:50] celebration going on come on the problem
[1:41:54] between this crowd and the crowd that
[1:41:56] was following Jesus Is This Crowd
[1:41:58] couldn't identify what present tense
[1:42:01] word was being
[1:42:02] fulfilled they were still fasting for
[1:42:05] something oh God send it send it send it
[1:42:08] send it and it was already standing
[1:42:12] there you'll see this in just a minute
[1:42:16] you might as well move that
[1:42:26] thank you
[1:42:29] buddy Luke 18 Jesus talks about the
[1:42:33] fellow down the
[1:42:35] temple another guy over there's got his
[1:42:37] head down he's all humble and this
[1:42:39] Pharisees sing over his head up to the
[1:42:41] can you imagine can you can you realize
[1:42:43] a man people with such Pride yet they're
[1:42:46] so far from the word is not even funny
[1:42:49] so arrogant but missing the word of the
[1:42:51] hour stand right in front of them
[1:42:53] he's down the tell this is what he said
[1:42:55] told God I fast twice a week I give ties
[1:42:59] of all that I possess because it got to
[1:43:01] the place that they did Fast twice a
[1:43:03] week and he let's think about this he
[1:43:05] was telling God his
[1:43:09] credentials you think I want to come
[1:43:11] before almighty God and point to one
[1:43:13] credential I got brother I don't want to
[1:43:15] stand with him and point to anything I
[1:43:18] ever done I want to point to what Christ
[1:43:20] has did
[1:43:23] as a matter of fact you know that crowd
[1:43:25] and I don't know if you can accept this
[1:43:27] or not but that is granted eternal life
[1:43:28] and white Throne judgment when he says
[1:43:30] you did this this and this they didn't
[1:43:32] know they did
[1:43:35] it the only crowd Jesus reject was the
[1:43:39] ones that come up there and said we did
[1:43:40] this this and this and this all in thy
[1:43:42] name depart from me you work me I never
[1:43:44] knew you so you don't want to come in
[1:43:47] his presence telling him what you did I
[1:43:49] don't even come today telling God what I
[1:43:51] did I come telling God what he did this
[1:43:54] is what you did you died at Calvary you
[1:43:57] kept your word you sent Christ you sent
[1:44:00] a prophet and ain't what I did is what
[1:44:02] Christ has
[1:44:04] done the bride don't stand here in this
[1:44:07] end time pointing to her own Works she
[1:44:09] points to the finished work of Christ at
[1:44:12] Calvary where God took full
[1:44:14] responsibility for every man woman boy
[1:44:16] and
[1:44:17] girl can you say praise the Lord now let
[1:44:20] me just tell this on I got to hurry Jes
[1:44:23] Jesus was not anti-
[1:44:25] fasting no no more than he was anti-
[1:44:28] praying or anti-g giving what Jesus was
[1:44:32] against was why you do what you
[1:44:36] do Jesus was more or less concerned with
[1:44:40] a man's
[1:44:44] motive why he does what he does matter
[1:44:47] of fact in Matthew 6 when the King was
[1:44:50] teaching Kingdom principles and he be to
[1:44:53] to talk about fasting and praying he
[1:44:55] said first of all Matthew 61 take he
[1:44:58] that you do not your arms before
[1:45:01] men to be seen of them otherwise you
[1:45:04] have no reward of your father which is
[1:45:06] in
[1:45:08] heaven he comes down to verse six he
[1:45:10] said but thou when thou prayest enter in
[1:45:14] thy closet not like that fell in Luke 18
[1:45:16] down in the temple with his head in the
[1:45:17] air telling God all he did and he want
[1:45:19] to be recognized but in your closet when
[1:45:22] thou has shut thy door pray to thy
[1:45:25] father which is in secret and thy father
[1:45:28] which see in things shall reward thee
[1:45:29] openly by the way that was one of the
[1:45:32] scriptures that the angel Lord C our
[1:45:33] Prophet when it come to third pool of
[1:45:35] his
[1:45:36] ministry verse 16 he drops down he said
[1:45:39] moreover when you fast not if you fast
[1:45:41] but when you fast not if you pray but
[1:45:44] when you pray Christians pray Christians
[1:45:47] fast but we don't pray and fast for the
[1:45:50] same reason these bunch of Hypocrites
[1:45:51] did
[1:45:55] he said now watch as the Hypocrites of
[1:45:58] sad
[1:46:01] countenance for they disfigure their
[1:46:04] faces that they may appear unto men to
[1:46:08] fast you've seen
[1:46:11] them what's wrong brother nothing why
[1:46:15] you looking that way oh I just just
[1:46:18] fasting that's over you might as well
[1:46:20] just go get you a big hamburger forget
[1:46:22] it
[1:46:26] buddy of M one time went up to West
[1:46:27] Virginia on a 40-day fast about the 21st
[1:46:30] day we made it after the 21st day I was
[1:46:31] ready knock his head
[1:46:33] off he said God show you anything I said
[1:46:36] yep hamburgers and french fries and
[1:46:38] mashed potatoes I said I'm ready to get
[1:46:39] out of here I said longer I'm out here
[1:46:41] I'm losing love of God I'm ready to beat
[1:46:43] your head in said we ain't in the will
[1:46:45] of
[1:46:50] God he said they appear under me the
[1:46:53] fast verily I say to you they have their
[1:46:55] reward now watch but thou in thy fastest
[1:46:59] anoint thy head was thy face in other
[1:47:02] words you're not looking for man's
[1:47:06] acknowledgement you don't care what a
[1:47:08] man patch on the back or not you're
[1:47:10] interested in what God thinks about it
[1:47:13] now keep watching you'll see how this
[1:47:14] unfolds then he said that thou appear
[1:47:17] not un men to fast but thy father which
[1:47:19] seeth in secret and thy father which
[1:47:21] seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
[1:47:25] everybody say praise the Lord so Jesus
[1:47:29] listen this is beautiful is not
[1:47:31] objecting to fasting he's not objecting
[1:47:34] to giving he's not objecting to men
[1:47:37] praying he's objecting to the fact that
[1:47:40] their religious
[1:47:42] experience has took the
[1:47:47] joy the purpose of why you do what you
[1:47:51] do they there there are traditions mixed
[1:47:53] this thing completely up and that's why
[1:47:55] Jesus was against what they're doing now
[1:47:58] Watch What Happens the Pharisees fasted
[1:48:03] intentionally whiten their faces Jesus
[1:48:06] said they wanted to declare to others
[1:48:10] that they were mournful well you're
[1:48:13] going to see just in a minute that
[1:48:15] that's the evidence they missed their
[1:48:17] day in its
[1:48:19] message I'll read it right from the
[1:48:21] prophet here in just a second read
[1:48:22] religious
[1:48:24] individuals they were they wanted to
[1:48:26] show that they were morally religious
[1:48:29] and sober now listen to
[1:48:31] me Jesus had the ability to do like when
[1:48:34] they come in contact with Jesus it
[1:48:36] wasn't coming in contact with a typical
[1:48:38] individual that day because Jesus had
[1:48:40] the ability to look past
[1:48:43] this and he could stand there and say
[1:48:46] outwardly you look this way but inwardly
[1:48:49] you're full of dead men's bones they
[1:48:52] stand before man now that before they
[1:48:54] ever said the word he already knew what
[1:48:57] their thoughts
[1:48:59] was that's the scripture Jesus knew what
[1:49:02] they was thinking but they wern't
[1:49:04] standing just before anybody they were
[1:49:07] standing before the god of
[1:49:10] Heaven veiled in the form of a man they
[1:49:14] could not hide their
[1:49:18] thoughts finally the scripture says
[1:49:20] Jesus said they bind heavy burdens
[1:49:22] Grievous to be born and lay upon men's
[1:49:26] shoulders but they themselves will not
[1:49:29] move them with one of their
[1:49:32] fingers look the truth is they couldn't
[1:49:35] do it and neither could anybody else the
[1:49:37] only thing they done was privately lived
[1:49:39] a hypocritical life publicly tried to
[1:49:42] act like they were so righteous I seen
[1:49:45] the same thing back in the Pentecostal
[1:49:46] church and I'm not condemning them I'm
[1:49:47] just simply telling the facts they tell
[1:49:49] you not to go to the doctor and the
[1:49:51] first time their kid got sick they go
[1:49:53] out of town and take their child to the
[1:49:54] doctor that's
[1:49:56] hypocrisy thank God for a message that
[1:49:59] reveals the truth of those things can
[1:50:02] you say Amen church so here we find the
[1:50:06] Pharisees were
[1:50:09] appalled that Jesus was
[1:50:12] feasting on a day that to them he should
[1:50:15] have been
[1:50:20] fasting they couldn't understand how
[1:50:23] Jesus and his disciples would be
[1:50:26] feasting eating down there with number
[1:50:28] one not only eating but look who you're
[1:50:29] eating
[1:50:32] with and here we are down here keeping a
[1:50:35] fast and there y'all are keeping a feast
[1:50:39] I want to just give a thought to you
[1:50:42] now to enforce the point hammered home
[1:50:46] Jesus gives three illustrations to
[1:50:48] answer their question but I'm only going
[1:50:50] to use one this this afternoon
[1:50:52] to contrast their I'm GNA say it dead
[1:50:56] legalistic mournful religious form and
[1:51:01] activity with the
[1:51:03] liberty and the
[1:51:05] joy of the grace that's found in
[1:51:10] Christ let me give them to you Jesus
[1:51:13] essentially was saying
[1:51:15] this
[1:51:16] life in me is meant to be a wedding not
[1:51:21] a funeral
[1:51:28] let me let me give you example now now I
[1:51:30] don't know about you but I believe
[1:51:32] matter of fact I I know you believe this
[1:51:34] I know brother the Homer does that the
[1:51:36] same Ministry that Jesus had has
[1:51:38] repeated again in our
[1:51:41] day he told us that Luke 17:30 the son
[1:51:45] of man be revealed again now I do not
[1:51:47] believe that William Brandon was the son
[1:51:49] of man I believe he was a son of man no
[1:51:51] problem with that cuz he's a Prophet but
[1:51:53] the only the son of man is our Lord
[1:51:55] Jesus Christ can you say Amen his
[1:51:58] ministry repeated again in our day now
[1:52:01] we come up through if I could say it up
[1:52:04] through the stock tassel shook the shuck
[1:52:08] protects the seed you ever notice what
[1:52:10] God did with brother brandham brother
[1:52:12] brandham started out as a Baptist
[1:52:14] Minister nothing against him my father
[1:52:15] started out as a Baptist matter of fact
[1:52:17] I find sometimes fundamentally the
[1:52:19] Baptist know more about the scriptures
[1:52:20] than the Pentecostals
[1:52:23] they they they they fundamentally know
[1:52:26] what the scripture says about a Believer
[1:52:28] more than the Pentecostals do brother
[1:52:31] bam actually brother bam compared them
[1:52:33] together like one knew what was in the
[1:52:35] bank but couldn't write the check the
[1:52:36] other could write the check but didn't
[1:52:37] know it was in the bank so people always
[1:52:38] ask me are you Baptist said no you pente
[1:52:40] said no I'm bapticostal I'm I'm both of
[1:52:42] them
[1:52:47] together did you know brother B was a
[1:52:49] Baptist now technically according to
[1:52:52] Nature
[1:52:53] God could not bring brother brandham as
[1:52:55] a
[1:52:56] Baptist into the
[1:52:59] seed pay attention to me a minute
[1:53:01] because the Baptist was back down here
[1:53:03] in the stalk and tassel remember when
[1:53:05] the poen dropped off from the great
[1:53:06] missionary age John Smith part of the
[1:53:08] Baptist Church that's where it was
[1:53:09] formed so it would be against nature to
[1:53:12] take that Prophet straight into the seed
[1:53:15] form so what does he have to do he has
[1:53:18] to force him into the Pentecostal age
[1:53:23] you say Force absolutely Force cuz when
[1:53:26] he went down there you remember brother
[1:53:28] bram's mother-in-law had a problem with
[1:53:31] brother bam going to the Pentecostal now
[1:53:33] let me just tell you this at that time
[1:53:35] the life was in the
[1:53:38] Shu that's where the life was was in the
[1:53:41] Shar and brother bab said all the life
[1:53:43] that's in the Shar has got to go in the
[1:53:45] seed so the seed has got to be in the
[1:53:47] shuck for the life to go into the
[1:53:49] seed it don't go into the stock it don't
[1:53:52] go
[1:53:53] this thing's growing up into full
[1:53:54] maturity now so he listens to his
[1:53:57] mother-in-law well y'all know the story
[1:53:59] you see how important it was to God that
[1:54:02] that Prophet go the Pentecostal he was
[1:54:04] willing to take his wife and his
[1:54:06] baby finally when sister brandom died
[1:54:09] butam called her back she said Bill I
[1:54:11] know where we made our mistake we should
[1:54:13] have never listened to Mama and said
[1:54:16] promise me now you know what brother bam
[1:54:18] did he went to the Pentecostal and
[1:54:20] listen to what brother bam says when he
[1:54:21] was down to that night and that little
[1:54:24] aged black gentleman with white ring
[1:54:26] hair around his head was preaching but B
[1:54:29] say he jumped up clicked his heels
[1:54:30] together said y'all ain't got enough
[1:54:31] room but B said these words whatever
[1:54:33] they had I
[1:54:37] needed brother there was a life that was
[1:54:39] in the Pentecostal church that had to go
[1:54:41] into the seed brother bam had to go
[1:54:44] among the Pentecostals that's where the
[1:54:46] life was and watch when he receives the
[1:54:48] life now the very shuck age has to
[1:54:53] protect that man's Ministry while it's
[1:54:55] in its
[1:54:58] infancy who received him the
[1:55:00] Pentecostals remember they said brother
[1:55:02] won't you go down here he said why don't
[1:55:04] y'all invite me it was the Pentecostals
[1:55:07] that was receiving brother Bon's
[1:55:09] Ministry especially under the first and
[1:55:11] second pool of his ministry especially
[1:55:13] the first pool now we know all the
[1:55:15] details of that how the Carl
[1:55:17] impersonators ra but let me tell you
[1:55:18] this it wasn't their it was not the Carl
[1:55:21] impersonator fault in this age that they
[1:55:23] impersonated brother
[1:55:25] bradam no no the angel of God rebuked
[1:55:29] brother bradam and said you caused
[1:55:31] it because he tried to explain the pools
[1:55:35] to him and he caused the Carl
[1:55:38] impersonators and then he got rebuked
[1:55:40] and said on this third one don't you
[1:55:42] tell to nobody and then the prophet said
[1:55:43] on this third pool there will be no
[1:55:45] impersonation this third pool is that
[1:55:48] right but now watch they protect his
[1:55:50] ministry young prophet stand there hold
[1:55:53] people's hands tell them to re e and by
[1:55:55] the way not one time ever missed
[1:55:59] it I come out Pentecostal Church where
[1:56:02] they hit and miss hit and miss hit and
[1:56:04] miss I've had them tell people you got
[1:56:07] back trouble and they say no I don't
[1:56:08] have no back trouble bless God you're
[1:56:10] going to have back
[1:56:12] trouble that's a devil that ain't
[1:56:16] anointing of the Holy Spirit that's a
[1:56:20] Dev that's right now I won't call the
[1:56:22] names of the people that I was
[1:56:24] associated with but I can just tell you
[1:56:25] this there was a genuine
[1:56:28] anointing just like brother bam taught
[1:56:30] us in knowing the end time that was a
[1:56:32] genuine anointing those people i' never
[1:56:34] seen people pray and fast more than
[1:56:37] anybody matter of fact we didn't go a
[1:56:39] week without doing it we fasted every
[1:56:42] week and look think about that the very
[1:56:44] thing that my Pentecostal Brethren were
[1:56:46] fasting praying for it was it was
[1:56:49] already sent and they missed it
[1:56:54] you say brother Luke is that possible
[1:56:55] that's what the prophet of God says
[1:56:56] you'll see it in just a minute when they
[1:56:58] should have been over here feasting they
[1:57:00] were still fasting when they should have
[1:57:02] been over here in the present tense word
[1:57:05] let me say it like this United with
[1:57:07] Christ in an invisible Union under a
[1:57:09] marriage that were over there FAS and
[1:57:11] looking for something that God already
[1:57:17] did so finally they protected under the
[1:57:20] second pull the very very shook that
[1:57:23] protected William Brandon's Ministry in
[1:57:25] its empathy he be to have to prophesy
[1:57:28] against the very shook that protected
[1:57:30] him cuz he seen where they were going
[1:57:33] toward organization and he begins to
[1:57:35] prophesy against and brother bam says
[1:57:37] this under the Sixth trumpet the
[1:57:39] Pentecostal rejected the Bible and he
[1:57:41] said under the second pool he prophesied
[1:57:44] against their organizations then the
[1:57:46] shuck begin to pull away so the seed
[1:57:48] could get into the pr look they didn't
[1:57:50] reject Christ under the Third pull to
[1:57:52] open the word that wasn't for them that
[1:57:54] was for us they rejected Christ's
[1:57:57] ministry under the second pool of his
[1:58:00] ministry they turned down Christ did
[1:58:04] they stop fasting absolutely
[1:58:07] not that they stop praying absolutely
[1:58:10] not they call individual fast they call
[1:58:13] corporate fast but here was Jesus's
[1:58:15] whole
[1:58:16] problem he says life now that the word
[1:58:19] standing here now what yall have looked
[1:58:22] for for 4,000 years since the fall of
[1:58:24] Adam here he is while you should be
[1:58:27] feasting y'all still fasting for
[1:58:29] something that's that's already
[1:58:31] here while you should be at a wedding
[1:58:34] you're at a
[1:58:36] funeral see watch this because watch
[1:58:39] some of the crowd this is amazing to me
[1:58:41] but some of the crowd that was there
[1:58:43] that day was called the Disciples of
[1:58:44] John well if they don't understood do
[1:58:46] you know what John was called John was
[1:58:48] called the friend to
[1:58:50] the the bridegroom the bridegroom was
[1:58:54] standing there there was a feast going
[1:58:56] on look you call this a fellowship
[1:58:59] meeting so guess what we're here to
[1:59:03] Fellowship that's like people going down
[1:59:06] to the ball game and then sitting there
[1:59:08] like they can't stand being there I was
[1:59:11] like man if you're that religious go
[1:59:13] home somebody hits a good ball and
[1:59:16] they like clap for my good you're at a
[1:59:19] ball game you got to get in the spirit
[1:59:20] of the thing
[1:59:22] I'm sorry but I tell us all over the
[1:59:24] world John's Daddy back there when I
[1:59:26] first come to South Carolina he was the
[1:59:28] song leader and I I got him beside one
[1:59:30] day I said look brother we we can't keep
[1:59:31] doing this I said what you mean can't
[1:59:33] keep doing this I said can't keep doing
[1:59:34] this I said you're a black man acting
[1:59:36] like a white man I can't stand it I said
[1:59:38] you hung around these white people so
[1:59:40] long they stole your soul from you I
[1:59:42] said black people don't sing out their
[1:59:43] nose they sing from their soul
[1:59:45] Something's Got a chance well he said
[1:59:47] well I'm I'm just not an emotional fell
[1:59:49] I said okay I I'll buy that one I didn't
[1:59:51] believe it
[1:59:53] so one day he invites me down to watch
[1:59:55] Clemson University
[1:59:57] which I don't go across street watch
[2:00:00] them but I went my wife and I said we're

[2:00:08] would have thought we was a Clinton we
[2:00:09] was a bunch of Hypocrites we like none
[2:00:11] of them and I sat there and it was a
[2:00:13] basketball game brother Rudy sat here

[2:00:17] know who you're talking to if you're
[2:00:18] talking to his mama he's Valentino do
[2:00:20] not call him Rudy

[2:00:24] and I said here Clipson was losing boy
[2:00:27] got the ball dribbled down in the court
[2:00:29] slammed and went ahead by one point Rudy
[2:00:33] this non-emotional guy comes up about
[2:00:36] that high off the
[2:00:37] ground
[2:00:39] W I just kind of lean my head over I
[2:00:43] said you are in trouble
[2:00:47] Sunday no you're emotional but it's if
[2:00:50] you love
[2:00:52] if you're in love with what you're doing
[2:00:54] then you get emotional over it and this
[2:00:56] what I got to say if you come to church
[2:00:57] and tell me you ain't got emotional
[2:00:59] maybe you don't really like why you're
[2:01:01] here this ain't a funeral service this
[2:01:03] is church this is a resurrected Christ
[2:01:07] and brother bam says we ought to be the
[2:01:09] most happiest people there is on the
[2:01:11] face of the Earth if anybody's got a
[2:01:13] right to worship God we got a right to
[2:01:15] worship
[2:01:17] God let me hurry with this watch watch
[2:01:19] this just for a second it was it was the
[2:01:22] fact that a wedding was going on a feast
[2:01:25] was going on there was Fellowship there
[2:01:27] was Joy supposed to be taking place and
[2:01:30] then here was people over here they
[2:01:32] didn't know why he was eating with them
[2:01:34] people didn't know why that they're not
[2:01:36] fasting and got their sad face like
[2:01:38] everybody else and and I'm me the only
[2:01:41] difference was was one what let I if I
[2:01:44] could say this way one wasn't just
[2:01:46] everybody say you see the message look
[2:01:47] it ain't just we see the message we are
[2:01:49] the
[2:01:50] message Jesus what they're trying to
[2:01:52] just show a message he was the message
[2:01:54] lived out look brother I'm not in the
[2:01:56] message the message is in me and you
[2:01:58] know what I mean I don't mean that to be
[2:01:59] smart I'm just telling you it this ain't
[2:02:01] another organization every might joining
[2:02:03] a message church if you look if if
[2:02:06] there's something in this message that
[2:02:07] we could preach or say or the prophet
[2:02:09] would say that would run you out this
[2:02:10] message get out of here quit wasting our
[2:02:12] time your day will come you'll manifest
[2:02:15] what you are but if you're a real
[2:02:16] believer and this Holy Ghost has called
[2:02:18] you this message daring a devil in hell
[2:02:20] can talk you out of it somebody talks
[2:02:22] you in somebody talks you out of it but
[2:02:24] if the Holy Ghost by Sovereign Grace
[2:02:26] reveals it to you they the devil hell
[2:02:29] take it out of
[2:02:30] you Hallelujah brother my whole deal
[2:02:33] right now is this I do not understand
[2:02:36] everything brother bradam said but
[2:02:38] neither did the disciples but what was
[2:02:41] the difference between the disciples
[2:02:42] staying with Jesus and all the rest of
[2:02:44] them walking away it was not the
[2:02:46] disciples understood Eat My Flesh and
[2:02:48] drink my blood the difference was not
[2:02:50] understanding the difference wasn't
[2:02:52] knowing who said
[2:02:55] it that was the difference cuz if you
[2:02:58] know who said it then it don't matter
[2:03:00] what he says you believe what God says
[2:03:02] that was the difference between the
[2:03:03] disciples and the rest of them that
[2:03:05] walked away and here's my deal it's
[2:03:07] ain't William brandom revealed this is
[2:03:09] Jesus Christ revealed one of his forms
[2:03:12] with the prophet of God and today the
[2:03:14] bride of Christ is still a manifestation
[2:03:17] of the unveiling of God
[2:03:20] Amen not trying to believe the message
[2:03:23] either Believe it or you
[2:03:25] don't do you believe that listen what
[2:03:28] brother B said let me hurry brother H
[2:03:30] I'm trying I'm almost
[2:03:31] done but B says think about the message
[2:03:34] is quoting from recognizing your day in
[2:03:36] its message he said what time is it
[2:03:39] brother he's asking question what time
[2:03:40] is it brother what time is it Minister
[2:03:43] look there was just as many preachers
[2:03:45] that couldn't see this message it was
[2:03:47] ly and they studied the Bible every day
[2:03:50] I got tremendous I'm talking about men I
[2:03:53] love honestly today I still love them
[2:03:55] I'm not against those Brothers but and I
[2:03:58] think myself God how would you show an
[2:03:59] 18y old boy this me and you couldn't
[2:04:01] show a man that's been studing studying
[2:04:03] the Bible for 40
[2:04:04] years but you can't say well brother
[2:04:07] Luke you fasted into this message you
[2:04:08] prayed no I didn't fast and prayed and
[2:04:10] nothing I got here cuz God before the
[2:04:13] foundation world for knew that I would
[2:04:15] see this message if we see this message
[2:04:18] the only difference Us and Them can't
[2:04:20] see it is The Sovereign Grace of God
[2:04:22] you ain't pointing to nothing else but
[2:04:23] God's
[2:04:24] grace but B said do you see the time of
[2:04:28] the day and the sign you're living under
[2:04:31] can you understand it do you see it he's
[2:04:36] asking that question then he said
[2:04:38] everywhere now there's no Revival now
[2:04:41] look brother bram's definition of VI
[2:04:44] Revival and the and the
[2:04:46] denominal definition of Revival is two
[2:04:49] different
[2:04:50] definitions to be truthful with you just
[2:04:52] to stir is not a Revival look we claim
[2:04:56] we had Revival every summer at the youth
[2:05:00] camps and you know what every year it
[2:05:02] was the same people getting saved over
[2:05:03] and over and over and over and over and
[2:05:04] over I got saved so many times in
[2:05:06] Pentecost baptized re baptized many time
[2:05:08] it wasn't
[2:05:12] funny it's just
[2:05:14] true really technically Revival is
[2:05:18] Sovereign God sends it he red destinat
[2:05:22] it he'll raise up a man set his
[2:05:24] anointing on and God would deal with
[2:05:26] that man they no man goes to heaven and
[2:05:28] gets a message God comes down from
[2:05:30] heaven with the m he gets a
[2:05:32] man Moses said don't say who send to
[2:05:35] Heaven who call across the sea bring
[2:05:37] back where he said no the words not thee
[2:05:39] in thy mouth and thy heart the word of
[2:05:40] faith which we preach Moses didn't go
[2:05:42] get the Commandments the Commandments
[2:05:43] come and got Moses Paul didn't go get
[2:05:46] the New Testament Revelation the
[2:05:47] Revelation come and got
[2:05:49] Paul amen and William didn't go get this
[2:05:52] message this message came and got
[2:05:53] William
[2:05:54] bradam and the same Pillar of Fire that
[2:05:57] wrote the Bible days of Moses and Paul
[2:06:00] has now been sent this day to interpret
[2:06:02] the Bible to us that's not men that's
[2:06:04] God himself picking his men and using
[2:06:07] his men it's Sovereign
[2:06:10] Grace brother B said listen I'm closing
[2:06:12] everywhere now there's no Revival
[2:06:14] everybody's complaining ministers are
[2:06:17] crying I was reading one of the
[2:06:19] outstanding papers that comes into the
[2:06:21] church a very fine paper brother sister
[2:06:23] more The Herald of his coming one of the
[2:06:25] finest paper in the field The Herald of
[2:06:27] his coming but they hardly will print
[2:06:29] anything unless it's fast pray fast
[2:06:33] pray watch you see it all the time fast
[2:06:36] pray sound the trumpet how many reads it
[2:06:38] you know you see it all the time fast
[2:06:40] pray fast pray how many you hear it fast
[2:06:41] pray fast pray we're going to have a
[2:06:44] great breaking of the day there's a
[2:06:47] great thing going to happen all of you
[2:06:48] pray pray pray pray we're not too late
[2:06:50] yet I heard that my whole
[2:06:52] life like another year 2015 here we get
[2:06:55] a slogan for
[2:06:56] it and that boy look they kept hanging
[2:06:58] the carrot front of you and just about
[2:07:00] soon as you think you got it it's gone
[2:07:02] next year next year next year you never
[2:07:06] do get
[2:07:09] it but B said now watch this what said
[2:07:12] why do they do that why do they do that
[2:07:14] they want a great awaken they're crying
[2:07:16] believing that there will be an
[2:07:17] Awakening they're good
[2:07:19] people why is that what if have they
[2:07:22] done they have not recognized The
[2:07:26] Awakening of the
[2:07:27] Bride see by being a Christian they feel
[2:07:31] the pool of the hour but they haven't
[2:07:33] recognized what's been
[2:07:36] done see here the thing is they're
[2:07:39] fasting for it and it's already
[2:07:41] there they're looking for it and it's
[2:07:44] already
[2:07:45] came look do you know most of the world
[2:07:47] today is still looking for the Lord
[2:07:49] himself to come down from heaven to
[2:07:50] shout they still sing about and he's
[2:07:52] already came down from heav with a shout
[2:07:54] a message has already why do you think
[2:07:56] you're here a message came down in this
[2:07:58] Ag and called you out of those
[2:08:00] denominations back to the word of
[2:08:05] God
[2:08:06] Amen they have not recognized it what's
[2:08:09] been done what's making them feel that
[2:08:11] way they know something is supposed to
[2:08:15] happen but they're looking for it way
[2:08:18] off in the future to come when it's
[2:08:20] already happened
[2:08:22] right by you let me just tell you this
[2:08:25] weddings and funerals don't
[2:08:27] mix fasting and feasting don't
[2:08:31] mix now I'm gonna say this to you John
[2:08:34] the Revelator we call him the Revelator
[2:08:36] but John in the Book of Revelation
[2:08:38] chapter 5 Saul one sitting on a throne
[2:08:42] and in his book in his hand was a book
[2:08:46] closed John said I wept much y
[2:08:53] he was
[2:08:54] weeping because no man had claimed a
[2:08:56] book but then you remember the story out
[2:08:58] behind the throne here come a lamb Don
[2:09:00] one of the elders announced and by the
[2:09:02] way you know somebody said bro Luke all
[2:09:04] that emotion and all that Joy you talk
[2:09:06] about and all that clapping and singing
[2:09:08] y'all do and you know that's just a
[2:09:09] bunch of babies in the
[2:09:11] message really I said really kind of
[2:09:14] strange I said when the Revelation 5 was
[2:09:17] open the Bible said John saw the lamb
[2:09:21] coming take the book he screamed and
[2:09:22] hollered and the Bible don't say 4 and
[2:09:25] 20 babies it said 4 and 20
[2:09:30] Elders what happened his mourning turned
[2:09:34] to
[2:09:35] Joy when the lamb came and took the book
[2:09:38] and broke the seals it went from
[2:09:40] mourning to rejoicing brother if there's
[2:09:43] anybody that's got a right to be
[2:09:44] rejoicing seeing the identified word
[2:09:48] understanding we're being united with
[2:09:49] Christ now in a marriage not over there
[2:09:51] the marriage is taking place here this
[2:09:53] group ought to be rejoicing over the
[2:09:55] things of
[2:09:57] God do you believe that say
[2:10:00] Amen so here it is in closing right
[2:10:04] here
[2:10:05] Jesus was
[2:10:07] different it wouldn't have mattered be
[2:10:09] honest with you it wouldn't have
[2:10:10] mattered if they're going to be critics
[2:10:12] they're going to be critics John
[2:10:14] came not eating and drinking and look
[2:10:17] what they said about him then Jesus came
[2:10:20] eating and drinking and and look what
[2:10:21] they said about him the critics are
[2:10:24] always going to
[2:10:26] criticize but the difference is is one
[2:10:29] saw the identified word and one did not
[2:10:32] see it one look doesn't mean that one
[2:10:35] wasn't a believer One was still looking
[2:10:37] for it and one done recognize that it
[2:10:40] was already
[2:10:43] there can you say praise the Lord let me
[2:10:47] let me close on this thought
[2:10:48] here I think my 30 minutes is up
[2:10:56] weddings was the most happiest time in
[2:10:58] the Jewish lady's
[2:11:00] life that's a little different ours we
[2:11:02] get married to be honest with you we
[2:11:04] don't want to
[2:11:06] Feast when I got married to my wife
[2:11:08] reception forget y'all I'm
[2:11:11] gone it was stupid to me I said why we
[2:11:15] got to go down there and eat with people
[2:11:16] I'm not wor eating their food I want to
[2:11:17] go with you forget that bunch of junk
[2:11:23] but a wedding in that time was when the
[2:11:28] man and woman got married they didn't
[2:11:29] run off they stayed around about a week
[2:11:31] seven days and they did nothing but
[2:11:37] feast and they and they loved it matter
[2:11:39] of fact it was such this is beautiful it
[2:11:41] was such a feast that the rabbis passed
[2:11:44] laws that the people were were they
[2:11:47] didn't have to keep the laws even when
[2:11:48] it came to fasting during that time if
[2:11:50] it was a waiting on on feast going on
[2:11:51] you you could lay aside your laws and
[2:11:53] just get all involved in the
[2:11:58] feast I don't how man can't see that
[2:12:01] brother sister this is a
[2:12:03] feast you said BR look what are you
[2:12:05] feasting on a seven full course
