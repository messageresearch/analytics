[1:11] i got a few comments i want to make
[1:13] afterwards but i want to let us all get
[1:16] the symbols right let us all get the
[1:19] the thought right because here's my
[1:21] whole point through the seals and i hope
[1:23] you're catching this like brother
[1:24] branson i hope you're catching something
[1:25] in this
[1:26] in this uh week of course this took us
[1:29] 20
[1:31] 20 little thermonets to get to this to
[1:33] the end of the first sale but
[1:36] i can't reveal the first seal to you i i
[1:39] don't want you people to
[1:41] to your brothers and sisters to to think
[1:44] that and it's happening and we talked
[1:45] about last night it's happening in the
[1:47] message

[2:05] you got to have teachers you got to have
[2:07] something in school you've got to have
[2:08] the bible

[2:12] alone brother brown says as persons
[2:16] communing with your creator we know it
[2:19] has to come to a fivefold ministry
[2:20] because the bible says for the
[2:22] perfecting the
[2:23] of the saints you have to have these
[2:24] things but
[2:26] then also the bible says that there need
[2:29] no man teach you why because the holy
[2:30] ghost is the teacher he's the one that
[2:32] come in to give you
[2:33] the revelation i can tell you symbols i
[2:36] can draw it out and i can even tell you

[2:59] and this is what right here let's turn
[3:00] now and read it
[3:05] it's in the first seal
[3:19] because brother brown even talks about
[3:21] you know the church
[3:25] being raptured what's the next great
[3:26] thing it's the rapture of the church
[3:33] paragraph 374 excuse me
[3:36] that's page 153 paragraph 374
[3:44] educate educated this is a sacred
[3:47] superman with education wisdom church
[3:49] theology of his own words
[3:51] of his own making and he rides his wife
[3:55] denominational horse to deceive
[3:57] the people and he will conquer every
[4:00] religion
[4:02] of the world does everybody realize that
[4:05] every religion
[4:08] of the world not communism not
[4:12] not the united states not
[4:15] uh no no
[4:18] i'm trying to find one more
[4:23] america 401 let's go to 401.
[4:36] all right paragraph 401
[4:39] that white horse rider has been in the
[4:42] in the land
[4:43] all the time
[4:46] all right so he's been
[4:50] he was there he just took a profit to
[4:52] bring it out because let's go back to
[4:53] let's go back to 398.
[5:01] because look this is what god promised
[5:02] if you'll remember god's promise now
[5:04] look
[5:05] paragraph 398 now notice in the same
[5:07] time this is going on just before this
[5:09] take place rather on the earth god has
[5:11] promised
[5:12] while all of them scrupled the
[5:13] denominations arguing their differences
[5:15] about their creeds god promised that he
[5:17] would send us a true prophet
[5:19] of the true word with a message
[5:23] to return to the original word of god
[5:25] and the faith of the fathers to bring
[5:27] down the power of the holy ghost
[5:29] amongst the people with a power that
[5:31] will raise her above these things and
[5:33] take her in
[5:34] at the same time in other words as the
[5:36] antichrist is coming on the scene
[5:39] the holy ghost is already on the scene
[5:42] antichrist is on the scene
[5:44] but what's going to happen is is the
[5:46] antichrist system is going to stay here
[5:49] and the holy ghost is going to take us
[5:51] out of here
[5:52] all right then go to 399.
[5:58] who is that white horse rider you're not
[6:00] blind you see who he is it's that
[6:01] antichrist and that deceitful spirit has
[6:03] gone on now
[6:05] and crept in now let's go to 401
[6:08] that white horse rider has been in the
[6:10] land all the time
[6:12] he will change from antichrist he does
[6:14] that and becomes to a false prophet
[6:16] see he first started an antichrist the
[6:18] spirit then he became a false prophet
[6:20] then later when the devil is cast out he
[6:22] is incarnate then with the devil
[6:23] three stages the first he's the devil to
[6:25] begin with the spirit of the devil
[6:27] then he becomes a false prophet teacher
[6:29] of a false doctrine
[6:30] next thing he comes to the very devil
[6:32] himself incarnate see
[6:33] there he is and at the same time that
[6:35] this devil falls out of heaven
[6:37] and becomes incarnate of man the holy
[6:39] spirit goes up
[6:40] and comes down in incarnate in
[6:44] incarnate man amen o
[6:47] what a time
[6:51] look 490 i mean coral five let me tell
[6:53] you something brother
[6:54] i just now know for one time in my life
[6:56] why that spirit has always warned me
[6:58] against them that organization now see
[7:00] he cried out against all that
[7:03] but now remember one thing
[7:08] if we know the denominational systems
[7:11] are wrong
[7:13] then guess what that
[7:19] spirit is not deceiving us
[7:24] if we see it out there because brother
[7:26] branham came brought a message tie the
[7:27] loose ends together get everything
[7:29] ready come out of her my people
[7:33] so we came out of the denominational
[7:35] churches
[7:36] but now we've got to get the
[7:37] denominational spirit out of us
[7:40] all right that's where it's got to come
[7:42] to and i was thinking
[7:44] and for those of you that don't know
[7:45] what i'll be ministering this afternoon
[7:47] on a subject but when joshua went into
[7:49] promised land he had things he had to
[7:51] get to drive
[7:51] out even with the holy ghost
[7:55] but now god promised that land for them
[7:59] see so god promised this land our land
[8:02] nothing is not
[8:03] now just being born again that was the
[8:06] land that came
[8:08] through luther wesley pentecost you
[8:11] understand what i'm saying
[8:12] but when brother brown really brought
[8:14] his message it was this here
[8:16] the seal to change your body something
[8:19] to change the person
[8:21] and i got a quote in here but i can't
[8:22] find it i found it this morning i should
[8:24] have marked it
[8:25] but he says it comes down to the life
[8:28] and that's what it's coming down to it's
[8:29] coming down to the life you see all
[8:31] these people in the message
[8:33] uh preachers getting caught in adultery
[8:35] preachers getting caught in money
[8:36] problems preachers getting caught in it
[8:38] why satan's satan's target is us
[8:41] if he gets us he's got you right if he
[8:44] gets us sorry
[8:46] and just the way it is if he gets us
[8:47] he's got jews but if he can get the
[8:49] preachers
[8:50] because the the past teachers preachers
[8:53] pastors evangelists apostles
[8:55] or for the perfecting of the saints
[8:58] not making you lower than them but if he
[9:01] gets
[9:01] the first fruit because we're supposed
[9:04] to get it first
[9:06] joshua got it first and then he what he
[9:07] gave it to the priest
[9:09] we'll talk about it this afternoon but
[9:11] now let's go through and see and make
[9:13] sure that we understand at least the
[9:14] symbols
[9:16] at least what's going on in the first
[9:18] seal
[9:19] because i cannot bring you some great
[9:21] mighty revelation
[9:22] it's been preached by the prophet it's
[9:25] been preached by many great men brother
[9:26] dale's got a
[9:27] whole series on it and if you want to i
[9:29] think they got it somewhere that you can
[9:31] read
[9:32] i mean that you can listen to but
[9:40] let's look at this and let's make sure
[9:42] that we got all this correct
[9:44] but if you got it lined up then god can
[9:46] help you right
[9:48] what the problem is down through the
[9:49] ages we just like i told you about the
[9:52] little
[9:52] the little uh illustration about you
[9:54] know me looking at brother ray
[9:56] well the whole word of god is true but
[9:58] luther had one truth he was looking at
[10:00] one thing that just shall have no faith
[10:02] sanctification was a little bit more
[10:04] baptism in the holy ghost was more
[10:05] and why did why did brother brown put
[10:08] the holy spirit right here
[10:09] on the top of this pyramid or right here
[10:11] at
[10:12] after you get all these perches he said
[10:15] that sealed it together
[10:18] well that's what that's what we're
[10:20] trying to do we're trying not to just uh
[10:23] seal the inside of man the inside man if
[10:25] you're born again
[10:26] you're just as eternal as god is you
[10:28] never sinned a day in your life that's
[10:30] what we're talking about in a bible
[10:30] study last night
[10:32] you've got to understand the bible was
[10:34] written by man
[10:38] all right but god's word is eternal and
[10:42] the part
[10:43] he sees of you if he ever sees you sin
[10:46] he has to destroy you
[10:49] so if you're born again today he sees
[10:52] you sinless
[10:54] first john we read it last night the
[10:57] seed
[10:58] remaineth in you and you cannot sin why
[11:00] because you've begotten
[11:02] or born from that genesis 1 26 there was
[11:05] when god started
[11:06] having his children everybody understand
[11:09] that
[11:09] god created a group of people now not a
[11:13] group of people individuals he said let
[11:15] us make man in our image
[11:17] now if we were in the image of god that
[11:19] must be perfect
[11:22] right god's perfect so he created male
[11:26] and female created he them brother brown
[11:28] said that was in spirit form before we
[11:30] were even put in flesh when we start
[11:32] talking about multiplication we have to
[11:33] think a man and a woman has to get
[11:34] together and do what we do now
[11:36] that's not the way it's supposed to be
[11:38] spiritual multiplication is what god
[11:40] always wanted and that's what it's
[11:41] coming back to
[11:43] it's just we've got a flesh body now
[11:44] that we had to get from this earth which
[11:46] was cursed we've already been through
[11:47] that
[11:49] but when he said you're begotten of god
[11:51] that means you come from if my son josh
[11:53] was begotten
[11:54] between june and myself we begot a son
[11:57] but now god doesn't need a woman
[12:00] right that was a problem to start with
[12:03] true he is a male he brings forth his
[12:07] own
[12:07] so in the beginning god created all this
[12:09] stuff and he created male and female
[12:11] created he them
[12:12] all right then you go over to first john
[12:14] says you can't sin
[12:17] but then john says the same thing he
[12:19] says if you say you have no sin you're
[12:21] alive
[12:23] where are you looking at just like
[12:25] brother brown's quote he would say
[12:27] you never was born on any certain day
[12:29] you always was eternal
[12:32] what he was looking from the mind of god
[12:34] to you
[12:36] but now he'll tell you i've got one book
[12:38] where i marked it where
[12:39] this page he says you're totally sinless
[12:41] you can't sin you can't do anything
[12:42] wrong
[12:43] very next page you flip the page over
[12:45] and he said you must be born again you
[12:47] must come to the altar you must receive
[12:48] eternal life
[12:50] you say well the prophet's confused no
[12:51] he's not confused
[12:53] he's looking through the mind of god
[12:55] saying you're perfect
[12:57] there's nothing wrong with you at all
[12:59] but you've got to come back to the human
[13:01] part of it where brother brown looks it
[13:03] at the person and says your eternal life
[13:06] starts right here at the altar
[13:09] so you take so now you can take every
[13:11] quote and make them be perfect
[13:12] because it looks like he contradicts
[13:14] himself sometimes but remember one thing
[13:16] he's a prophet
[13:18] he looked through the eyes of god and
[13:20] could see a perfect
[13:21] complete now i call you bride your
[13:23] totally sinless virtuous bride of jesus
[13:26] christ
[13:27] well now that don't apply to nobody in
[13:29] this room that i'm looking at
[13:32] but it applies to everybody in this room
[13:34] that's born again that god's looking at
[13:36] so you understand how we make quotes we
[13:38] can say well hey you're perfect you're
[13:40] sinless you
[13:41] you've never done a you you've never had
[13:43] sin in your life
[13:45] but you're looking at me going i see him
[13:48] this morning
[13:49] well that's the human part then i can
[13:50] look at you and say you must be born
[13:52] again you need something from god
[13:53] you need this you need all these
[13:57] you need all these virtues you need a
[14:00] revelation
[14:01] but see what's the revelation got to
[14:02] come from though it's it's like this
[14:06] your sinner your inside man is the same
[14:10] god never did the wrong never had a bad
[14:13] thought
[14:14] never committed adultery never smoked a
[14:16] cigarette never i'm talking about never
[14:18] if there's one mark against this person
[14:19] you're not born again
[14:20] right right but it's not two people
[14:24] god just put his nature in here but now
[14:26] what's what's this over here this over
[14:28] here is
[14:29] that part of you that god's working on
[14:32] you must be born again
[14:34] you know you you must be you know taught
[14:36] that being born again well he didn't
[14:37] need
[14:38] 14 new births no he needed one you birth
[14:41] in his soul
[14:42] then he had to get that outside guy
[14:44] statue of a perfect man faith virtue
[14:46] knowledge
[14:46] but where is that that's in this guy
[14:50] remember the the old chief said in me is
[14:53] two dogs
[14:55] now there is two dogs see there's only
[14:57] one
[14:59] i hate to call it dog but there's only
[15:00] one
[15:02] um spirit in you when you're born and
[15:06] that's the nature that gets you to lie
[15:07] and stealing cheek do all the things
[15:09] but when god comes in and brother brown
[15:11] said burns that out
[15:12] vulcanized remember he used to use a
[15:14] little illustration about
[15:16] i know a lot of you don't younger people
[15:17] don't know what a tube is but
[15:19] i still remember we used to take the old
[15:21] cube out of the tire and you'd have to
[15:23] scrub it and rub it
[15:24] because what were you going to do you
[15:25] were going to take a torch and you were
[15:27] going to heat it or take a match and
[15:28] heat it
[15:29] put that little glue on there and smack
[15:32] it together and hold it there for a
[15:33] little while what were you doing you
[15:34] were making this rubber of the patch
[15:37] match this hole or this rubber on the
[15:39] tire
[15:40] but when they melded together if you
[15:42] really done it right
[15:43] it was stronger than the rest of the
[15:44] tire well that's what god did he took
[15:47] you and he burnt you out and then he
[15:50] brother brown said you and god in there
[15:52] together as persons but now what's he
[15:54] doing though he's not
[15:55] satisfied with that i should have done
[15:58] this before we started
[15:59] but it just came to me this morning that
[16:01] we may need to back up and
[16:03] and this is not just a symbols and
[16:08] it's putting it all together to me it to
[16:09] me it keeps it in continuity
[16:12] that when when god brings something to
[16:14] your memory you know where to find
[16:16] that or when the devil brings something
[16:18] to your memory
[16:19] memory you know where it's coming from
[16:21] see that's why brother branham
[16:23] when he gets on the fourth seal he names
[16:26] this death
[16:27] oh he said it was death to begin with
[16:29] remember we read where he said right
[16:30] here the white horse riders been here
[16:32] the whole time
[16:33] so the wild horse riders have been here
[16:34] the whole time white horse rider
[16:36] actually started from
[16:38] heaven rode right down and started
[16:41] riding into the people
[16:42] right but now in the end time there was
[16:45] no person and that doesn't make us any
[16:47] better but
[16:48] what i'm trying to say is our promised
[16:50] land is not now the baptism of the holy
[16:52] ghost just the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:55] everybody understand that it's not just
[16:57] that
[16:58] sure it's the most important thing you
[17:00] could do because without the holy ghost
[17:01] you can't go into these other realms
[17:04] all right but now that we have the holy
[17:06] ghost let's go into these other realms
[17:08] let's
[17:08] let's get the the hittites and the
[17:10] gurgiside you know there were seven
[17:12] ice in the promised land
[17:15] kind of strange it was seven highlights
[17:18] hittites
[17:19] jebusites gertrude sites all there were
[17:21] seven of them they listed them in the
[17:23] bible
[17:23] that joshua had to deal with
[17:27] in the promised land not before he got
[17:29] there in the promised land
[17:31] he had to deal with seven different
[17:33] groups of people and they all seven have
[17:34] different characteristics
[17:36] just like the seven church ages just
[17:37] like the seven ads
[17:39] when you get into the promised land we
[17:41] don't stop
[17:43] so tim and i were talking about coming
[17:44] home friday
[17:46] that's the only reason that i can see
[17:48] that that i know i'm born again
[17:50] is that i want to go on with god i want
[17:52] to learn more about him now if you don't
[17:54] want to learn more about god
[17:56] and if you want to not know no more than
[17:58] you did
[17:59] six months ago then you're either
[18:01] backslid or you're not born again one of
[18:03] the two
[18:04] you're not in a gray area you're not
[18:07] like brother brown said you're not
[18:08] almost pregnant
[18:09] no either you're pregnant with the word
[18:11] of god or you're not there's not a girl
[18:13] there's not a woman that's got well i'm
[18:14] almost pregnant no
[18:16] either you are you're not and what and
[18:18] the fruit show
[18:20] it shows whether you are it shows where
[18:21] you're not everybody understand we're
[18:22] all adulthood
[18:24] all right so the proof is in the life
[18:28] the proof is in the life it's going to
[18:30] come down to the life that you live
[18:32] that you allow by choice satan to do
[18:35] like a black dog white dog
[18:39] she said now in me i have a war
[18:43] let's go back one more time you didn't
[18:45] war in your members when you were the
[18:46] sinner
[18:47] sure there was little things in your
[18:49] life that god might say
[18:50] hey you shouldn't do that but you know
[18:52] what you overrode that and you went and
[18:53] did it anymore
[18:55] right right we all did that that's right
[18:57] why did we do that
[18:59] because there was no god residing
[19:02] in that place to cast that demon or
[19:06] dragon or
[19:07] red devil everywhere to cast that out
[19:10] so you did it but now when the holy
[19:13] ghost comes it
[19:14] it burns out that inside man gives you a
[19:17] new nature
[19:18] not in your soul a new nature because
[19:22] your soul is you
[19:24] but he gives you a new nature
[19:28] and begins to build brother brown said
[19:30] an image of the person
[19:32] that you are what that genesis 1 26
[19:35] image
[19:35] god wants that genesis one image to be
[19:38] in your outside man
[19:40] outside person outside whatever you want
[19:42] to call it nature
[19:43] because you get a nature from the world
[19:45] that's right
[19:46] it's like we're talking about last night
[19:48] the works of the flesh
[19:50] the works of the flesh are not bad
[19:55] james says when lust is conceived it
[19:58] brings forth sin
[20:00] when sin is finished it brings forth
[20:02] death
[20:03] there's four stages remember brother
[20:05] dale priesthood a long time ago
[20:08] when lust is conceived there's a
[20:09] conception there's two things coming
[20:11] together that the seed being planted
[20:12] somewhere
[20:13] but if you'll take all those works of
[20:15] the flesh that we were talking about
[20:16] last night
[20:18] envy strife hatred listen people we all
[20:21] live with that we're human beings right
[20:23] but if we take that and let it motivate
[20:27] our life
[20:28] then what are we doing we're cutting off
[20:30] the holy ghost that's inside of us even
[20:32] born again people have envy
[20:35] strife sorry
[20:38] i said black don't want no fight cause
[20:40] that's the flesh
[20:42] you were born that like brother dale
[20:43] said they they you don't want to hate
[20:45] the person
[20:46] but you hate what they do all right all
[20:49] right you got to keep that separate
[20:50] but when you were a sinner you just
[20:52] hated the person that's right
[20:54] and what did you do you formulated in
[20:56] your mind well he's the so-and-so and
[20:57] he's
[20:57] this and that and he's of this and us
[20:59] and this and you still do it as a
[21:01] christian but maybe it's just in a
[21:02] cleaner form
[21:03] you know everybody understand what i'm
[21:04] talking about okay
[21:06] but you call people but i hope you call
[21:07] people things back then i hope you don't
[21:09] do that now
[21:10] all right but like timbo was asking me
[21:12] coming home friday he said well what
[21:13] about all these bad he said i get these
[21:15] curse words and things i said you can't
[21:17] help that
[21:19] god i wish you could let me and dad was
[21:22] talking about what are those dreams you
[21:23] have you have a dream about something
[21:25] just ungodly and you wonder where did
[21:27] that come from
[21:28] well look don't let that bother you cut
[21:30] the thing off and say satan
[21:33] you you rolled the ball down through my
[21:35] brain
[21:36] last night but that ball is going to
[21:38] roll right on out the door
[21:41] see because remember jesus said the
[21:44] prince of this world
[21:45] satan has come and has nothing in me
[21:47] what
[21:48] in other words he could come he's going
[21:50] to come
[21:56] most powerful scripture in the world
[21:58] resist the devil
[21:59] and he'll flee from him but if you
[22:03] leave him an opportunity
[22:08] he'll plant a seed when lust is
[22:10] conceived lust is not bad
[22:12] you understand what i mean you have to
[22:13] have that between your husband and wife
[22:15] and
[22:15] even like i'm telling timbo you got to
[22:17] be careful with that word lust because
[22:19] it's affection you've got to have
[22:20] if you see a pretty woman you want to
[22:22] date her what
[22:24] is human beings i said don't let that
[22:27] body but you've got to keep that
[22:28] separate for me if you're a clean man
[22:30] if you're a clean man inside it won't
[22:32] let you do anything dirty to that system
[22:34] or
[22:34] or the girl that you're dating but now
[22:36] once you're married what you thought
[22:37] about was okay because you've come under
[22:40] what you're the bible says you know let
[22:42] the bed not be defiled and all these
[22:43] things
[22:44] we come in and god allowed that to
[22:46] happen
[22:48] and brother brown said you and your wife
[22:49] should enjoy each other enjoy
[22:51] the things of life together because if
[22:53] god put you together
[22:55] no man on this earth is going to take
[22:58] you asunder
[22:59] you become one just like christ from the
[23:01] bride that's what he's
[23:02] that's what he's telling us to do our
[23:04] natural affections
[23:05] shouldn't get in our way of our
[23:06] christian life though that's what you
[23:08] got to watch out for
[23:09] all right so this is a life lib let's go
[23:11] through these and just look at the
[23:13] symbols
[23:14] we'll go to the second seal next sunday
[23:18] and start with it but like i said i
[23:22] can't give you a revelation of
[23:24] the first seal you've got to ask god to
[23:27] give you a revelation
[23:29] of what that first seal means to you but
[23:32] remember one thing
[23:33] if you're born again whatever this seal
[23:36] is working on
[23:37] is connected to your outside man
[23:40] did everybody understand that because
[23:42] the seals were given for redemption
[23:45] of your flesh
[23:50] your flesh so we can change it
[23:53] right so we start with a horse
[23:58] remember the horse with the power and
[23:59] the power was given by what the people
[24:02] all right he was given a bow with no
[24:04] arrows which means he was a bluff
[24:06] all right a crown was given him
[24:09] he started out as a spirit but as we get
[24:13] through into this third church age
[24:15] they actually crowned a man they brought
[24:18] religion
[24:19] and and politics together
[24:22] uh constantine and all those brought
[24:24] everything and they crowned the pope so
[24:26] now they actually have
[24:27] a head now this is not satan incarnate
[24:30] not yet but it's in the baby form it's
[24:33] beginning to start look at the catholic
[24:35] church
[24:36] read that article jim broad the catholic
[24:38] church is so ingrained in people's mind
[24:40] even our local paper wrote about
[24:42] a girl which is in wichita kansas but
[24:45] she was dying and they
[24:46] prayed her mom and dad prayed to jesus
[24:48] and some dead saints been
[24:50] dead 55 years and said this dead saint
[24:53] changed somebody's mind in heaven and
[24:56] this catholicism
[25:00] how did it happen they believed
[25:03] and god healed him now god said if
[25:05] you'll believe i'll heal you
[25:07] that's why the brother ryan said a
[25:08] prostitute can come across a
[25:10] platform not have anything she knows
[25:12] she's a sinner she knows she's done
[25:13] wrong
[25:14] but she knows that man can touch god and
[25:15] if that man can touch god and tell me
[25:17] what my problem is
[25:18] then i'll be healed she'll be healed
[25:20] christian walks up brother brown says
[25:21] lose their healing why they're going oh
[25:23] i was oh i had a bad thought yesterday
[25:25] we're back to this whole thing what
[25:26] we're talking about oh
[25:27] i did this wrong yesterday i did this
[25:29] wrong and see so it muddled their mind
[25:30] up
[25:31] and they couldn't be healed all right
[25:33] well this girl was healed
[25:34] because they prayed to jesus number one
[25:37] and had faith
[25:38] but this dead saint had nothing to do
[25:40] with it but look how the catholic church
[25:41] i mean they wrote a big article in the
[25:42] paper june brought us out there so you
[25:44] look at it
[25:44] so what happened is they have made these
[25:46] little things
[25:49] to become alive now see
[25:52] when when when it started in the first
[25:54] three ages i really don't think they
[25:56] didn't have the revelation i say they
[25:58] uh paul irene said martin but see paul
[26:00] had a revelation that something was
[26:01] coming the antichrist
[26:03] grievous wolves all that john uh
[26:06] irenaeus martin all those
[26:08] probably didn't see because remember
[26:10] even martin luther
[26:11] coming on the other side in the in the
[26:14] fifth age
[26:16] he was loyal to the vote he was loyal to
[26:18] the catholic church
[26:19] right he actually went if you'll watch
[26:21] the movie he went two or three times to
[26:23] try to
[26:24] talk to the pope and get him to you know
[26:26] to uh to see what he thought about him
[26:28] of course the pope didn't
[26:30] because he was an antichrist spirit that
[26:32] had now become into a person
[26:34] and he is giving his false teaching as a
[26:36] false prophet but we'll get into that a
[26:38] little bit more
[26:39] so let's just don't say let's just don't
[26:41] say
[26:42] pope i was trying to write another word
[26:44] up there but i quote was the only thing
[26:45] it came to me but
[26:47] um it wasn't pope john paul the first
[26:50] and it wasn't you understand it's a
[26:52] system
[26:53] but they got to have a head just like we
[26:55] have a head that which is christ
[26:57] all right we saw in the first seal that
[26:59] the christ the lamb and the holy ghost
[27:00] is one god that's
[27:01] peace brother the christ lamb the holy
[27:03] ghost is
[27:04] one person one truly living god
[27:08] when god was incarnate in
[27:12] you and i william brown whoever and you
[27:15] see something right off in opposition
[27:17] going away you know one thing's for sure
[27:19] a battle has been won
[27:22] everybody understand that a battle has
[27:24] been won i want you to see that every
[27:25] time you have a bible through virtual
[27:27] interpretation god
[27:28] brother counts all well we're going to
[27:30] have to start
[27:31] seeing that certain things are going out
[27:33] of our life that's like i said before if
[27:35] we're still
[27:35] if we're still struggling to
[27:39] should i go to church or should i not or
[27:41] should i stay
[27:42] no just come back and start on the
[27:44] foundation let's get born again
[27:46] let's do the things right let's get
[27:49] justified sanctified let's get filled
[27:50] with the holy ghost
[27:51] and then god can start all right because
[27:54] god doesn't go backwards
[27:56] god always goes forward if you go
[27:58] backwards it's the devil
[28:00] right so that's what brother brown was
[28:02] showing he said here stands alone with
[28:03] the book in hand there goes the wild
[28:04] horse rider
[28:05] well what happened is he saw that
[28:07] organizational spirit
[28:08] go away from it you say from a prophet
[28:10] we all had
[28:12] we all had it he said i wondered why i
[28:15] hated that if you'll read in the first
[28:17] thing i wonder why i always hated it
[28:18] why because it's in opposition
[28:23] we go back to this right here remember
[28:25] the remember the
[28:28] vision or the prophecy by danny henry he
[28:30] said because of the way you chose
[28:32] which is the hard way so brother brown
[28:34] made a choice to go in that direction
[28:36] but god knew he's going to make that
[28:37] choice from the foundation of the world
[28:39] same way with you and i through foreign
[28:42] but the first seal shows
[28:45] me that that you got to see a true
[28:48] revelation of one god because if you
[28:49] don't
[28:50] then you've got other persons involved
[28:54] okay everybody understand that you gotta
[28:56] when you when when you see
[28:58] you got father son holy ghost and they
[28:59] split them up and then now in the
[29:01] message you got
[29:02] jesus wasn't god to the river jordan and
[29:03] he became god then you got two lords you
[29:06] got all this separation
[29:08] you can't stand and brother branham was
[29:11] standing in a position
[29:12] he said here stands the lamb he didn't
[29:13] say there
[29:15] or here they stood he said here stands a
[29:17] lamb right here with a book in his hand
[29:19] in other words
[29:20] god had come down into that man and was
[29:22] beginning to teach us something that
[29:24] we've never heard before
[29:26] okay through that little prophet through
[29:29] the ministry the fifo ministry the same
[29:31] thing's got to happen
[29:32] but you have got to see in your life
[29:34] you've got to see something go out
[29:36] go away from you this is after you're
[29:38] born again not before
[29:40] see before you see the unclean spirit
[29:42] goes out and all that you can read that
[29:43] that's just in sanctification before you
[29:45] even start in your christian journey
[29:48] i mean we all got problems with things
[29:49] we all got nature that we have to deal
[29:51] with
[29:52] but if you have to fight with with being
[29:54] a christian
[29:55] um you know whether i should smoke today
[29:58] or whether i should go
[29:59] you know oh i said a bad word or or you
[30:02] know
[30:03] that should be when we get to right here
[30:04] you're away from that i'm telling you
[30:06] this is
[30:07] and don't get me wrong this is not a
[30:09] different promised land it's the same
[30:10] promised land
[30:11] but when you get the holy ghost we need
[30:13] to step over and we'll we'll read it to
[30:15] this afternoon
[30:17] where once they got in the promised land
[30:20] there was something happen to a group of
[30:22] people
[30:23] that sanctified them for the journey in
[30:25] the promised land
[30:26] okay so christ the lamb and the holy
[30:29] ghost
[30:30] same person one god get a revelation of
[30:33] one true and living god
[30:34] if you do get a revelation one true and
[30:36] living god you must be baptized in the
[30:38] name of the lord jesus christ well that
[30:39] tells you one true living god
[30:41] right so if you've got to follow some
[30:43] holy ghost baptism
[30:46] you've got different persons that's
[30:47] right so you're not standing here in
[30:49] this position so let's go back
[30:52] let's go back and get that right see
[30:55] look at all the years
[30:57] i'm not gonna get finished maybe but and
[30:59] all those years look at where
[31:01] from from jesus's ascension in ab30
[31:06] until now has been two thousand years
[31:10] basically two thousand years it took two
[31:13] thousand years to get it back to where
[31:17] where he was standing on the earth as
[31:20] far as doctrinally
[31:22] correct does everybody understand that
[31:24] one true living god
[31:25] water baptism named lord jesus christ no
[31:27] eternal hell
[31:29] all the things that we have become
[31:31] indoctrinated all the way up through the
[31:33] ages
[31:34] it took us that 2 000 years and
[31:36] basically it took us
[31:37] all an average of 10 or 12 years or
[31:40] 20 years or 30 years or 40 years ever
[31:43] how long you've been in a message or
[31:44] been born again
[31:46] to come to a place where you really know
[31:47] there's one god
[31:50] where you really understand that you're
[31:52] not praying to jesus who prays to the
[31:53] father i mean your friend
[31:55] not praying to the holy ghost who's
[31:56] praying to jesus who's praying to the
[31:57] father
[31:58] that's catholicism that's three separate
[32:01] individual things you're doing just like
[32:03] the
[32:03] the with the catholic priest they had to
[32:05] put that priest in there
[32:06] because he's an intercessor well jesus
[32:08] christ is the only intercessor we need
[32:10] all right but christ lamb holy ghost all
[32:13] these are titles to one god
[32:16] all right so we must see that now the
[32:18] combat beast that said come and see
[32:20] that was a lion l-i-o-n lion it was a
[32:23] lion
[32:24] brother brown said it was bold it was in
[32:26] that first church age second church age
[32:28] third church age they were bold look at
[32:30] them
[32:30] all the disciples were killed except for
[32:32] john for what they preached all right
[32:34] they were
[32:35] uh saw asunder they were pulled apart
[32:37] they were drugged through the streets
[32:38] they were
[32:38] crucified upside down and all those
[32:41] things but
[32:42] they held true first second third age
[32:45] but what happened that third age ended
[32:46] at 606 a.d
[32:49] that was the last night the encounter
[32:51] where they came
[32:52] up with the father son holy ghost
[32:55] baptism
[32:57] and that jesus was a light substance of
[32:59] god not the substance of god
[33:02] and it's kind of strange we've come
[33:03] right back to another night seeing
[33:04] council in 2000 about six
[33:07] when they started that river jordan
[33:09] doctrine 2006
[33:10] 7 somewhere in there that jesus wasn't
[33:13] gone to the river jordan what is that
[33:14] different personality a different
[33:17] identity
[33:19] we'll go back to 606 and read that and i
[33:21] see in council
[33:23] jesus was a like substance of god
[33:27] not the substance of god's same way now
[33:30] they're separating them two lords
[33:35] look brother brown said that scripture
[33:37] always right and remember what i told
[33:38] you that white horse didn't die
[33:41] when he got off of it and got on the
[33:43] black horse or the red horse
[33:45] it just kept right that that idea kept
[33:48] riding in the people and i can see more
[33:49] now than ever
[33:50] how that thing's building on top of each
[33:52] other white red
[33:54] black and then pale all right that was
[33:56] the first three church ages
[33:57] and the wicked one was is being made
[33:59] known and that's what's gonna happen in
[34:00] the end time
[34:02] satan hid himself in denominations he's
[34:04] hid himself and follows unholy those
[34:06] baptisms he hid himself in all these
[34:08] different things
[34:08] but when that prophet came on the scene
[34:10] and he started putting that word
[34:11] together
[34:12] got us back to one true and living god
[34:14] then we can see that anything in
[34:16] opposition
[34:16] to that one true living god and that one
[34:19] true word of god
[34:20] is false it's like we were talking last
[34:22] night
[34:24] now in the end times one word off
[34:27] your antichrist one word
[34:30] you say well i can't do it well you just
[34:32] made your own
[34:34] choice i'm just going to believe as long
[34:37] as i'm alive
[34:38] brother as long as i'm alive that i'm
[34:42] going to choose to be one of them that's
[34:43] going to take a change
[34:44] right i'm just and i'm going to make
[34:46] myself available you can't just say that
[34:48] and then go sit home
[34:49] that's right you can't just say that and
[34:51] then say well i'm i'm done finished i'm
[34:53] gonna sell my books and i'm just
[34:54] no you ain't packed up ready to go up
[34:56] yet
[34:58] all right we're packing
[35:01] we're not packed up we're packing we're
[35:03] packing it in
[35:05] because one day you know we may not be
[35:07] able to do this
[35:08] we might be so separated but you know
[35:10] what god said
[35:12] i'll bring things to your remembrance
[35:14] whatsoever i have taught you
[35:17] that's why somebody bro tim asked me
[35:19] we'll get ready to go both tim asked me
[35:20] he said
[35:21] you said something about abraham being
[35:23] in the wrong place and he missed
[35:24] melchizedek
[35:25] brother branham said read it i'm looking
[35:27] for the quote couldn't find it
[35:29] because you got to get the wording right
[35:31] but he said if you're not in church
[35:33] that may be the very day that god comes
[35:35] by to speak to you and you're not there
[35:37] right wow that means you missed it
[35:42] brother brown said many times he'd call
[35:44] out people in the congregation he said
[35:45] sister
[35:46] you're missing it why because she didn't
[35:49] realize it was for her
[35:50] right i read the other day said sister
[35:52] you missed that but maybe he'll come
[35:54] back and
[35:54] and then he watched the angel would come
[35:56] down he said quickly stand up
[35:59] quickly accept it he said because you'll
[36:01] move on that's the same way with you and
[36:03] i
[36:03] and i don't mean to come to church every
[36:05] service but you ought to be here every
[36:06] service that you can
[36:08] you want to listen you ought to pray
[36:09] because one day god may turn around to
[36:11] you and say
[36:12] the reason you didn't make a change is
[36:14] because of
[36:16] xyz whatever you want to call it wrong
[36:18] right
[36:20] wrong place at the wrong time be at the
[36:22] bus station and have a train ticket you
[36:24] know
[36:24] you don't want to do that you want to be
[36:26] where the word of god is
[36:28] all right so that's the first seal
[36:31] um next sunday if you have any questions
[36:33] about the first seal we'll take the
[36:35] first 10 or 15 minutes and then we'll
[36:36] kind of do a review
[36:38] on the second seal so lord bless you go
[36:40] get out of here
