TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah okay good to see you everybody today Gary's face Revelations five we're gonna read it and hope you rocks your book because we're going to read out of the book today sir okay Revelation chapter five that's all in the right hand of him that sat on the throne of book written within and on the backside seal was seven sealed I saw a strong Angel Proclaim with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seal if they're up and no man this is man no man was Worthy no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book needed to look their own and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book needed to look their own one of the older Senator to me we've not behold the line of the tribe of Judah and the root of David has prevailed to open the book and at least the Seven Seals thereof I'll be held in law in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders through the lamb as they had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which of the seventh Pierce from God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him to settle on the throne we'll stop right there now let's go to our books and let's all just remember Brother Dean this morning you just came on my heart just now and he's really having a struggle with and your pastor Daddy's got something strong yeah eyes are all red and he's talking like book Edition the Brother Dean they think he has aneurysm and that's what's making his eyes and now his head's hurting so same God that broke all of us through what we had time that's what we're trying to see here you know I read you read this the book was book was written where Within and on the back side all right Within books written within and on the back side inside and out right this is for the Redemption of the whole man not just for the soul all right so keep that in mind yeah let's go to paragraph let's see if we can hold that paragraph together paragraph 11. brother Ryan was talking about the vision of the Angel and then he's going to make that commentary and then we're going to read the same thing you got to get the breach we are in the bridge yeah paragraph 11. says and I was standing there in prayer everybody say amen amen okay all right the reason I'm setting this as a basis is because I know we know brother randomly prophet of the end time but he come to a place to where God trusted him with something and that's the same place you and I have to come in God's got to trust us with something he said they're fine Simplicity and then the brief 60 if you got a book like mine yes yes I really thought he'd get off but I think maybe the black one in this one is the same yeah but the hardbound one that I've got the older one it's not they're all about it yeah okay all right page 60 of the breach paragraph 11. I will stand in there in prayer and something happened now something fell in my hand and I know if you don't understand spiritual things it may seem very strange something struck in my hand and when I looked it was a short it's described what it is and I looked down a little bit further word he said it was the prettiest thing I ever seen it fit my hand exactly okay see that I underlined that that that's the word what he said fit his hand exactly that sword was a type of the word right and it fit his hand it wasn't made for somebody else it was made for him but now when he took that sword read on over a little further 61 because this is something you and I got to see this is redemption this is not talking about what a prophet brought let me finish my statement people can't believe brother Brown and brought the revelation of the seals and die and go to hell you know emphatically state he opened the seal and if you're not born again and if you don't have this same experience not an experience with a literal sword coming down he had to do that because he was a prophet right prophets do things by types right symbols so when that sword came down and it fit his hand perfect he said it fit my hand perfect but 14. all right go to 14. paragraph 14. in dueling you see I don't understand I don't understand one word of it but one principle of dueling but the best of my understanding the knife striking across and finally the storage if they lock the enemy you lock the sword like this then it takes the strength of the man doing the dueling so in other words you're doing somebody and you got the best sword in the world if you ain't got the strength to hold on to it right because you'll watch those fencing when they when they fence you know they fence like this and then well when that store when they lock those swords like this they come up real close to each other you got to be strong enough to push that guy away and then do this you know all right that's what he's talking about then it takes the strength of the man Dooley because see his sword will be pointed at my heart and mine to his but they're locked as are not obstructing each other and then they strike and then the storage come together the one that can shove the other one down the sword is straight to the heart so it takes even though the sword be the word right even though the stored be the word it takes the hand of strong faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy now that's exactly what he did when he was God had to bring him to that place to where he could have that strong hand of faith and that's what you and I are going to have to have a strong hand of faith because no man is Worthy let's go back to Revelation 5. no man is worthy to do this but yeah that's good William Branham the man but it was a strong hand of Faith remember he was in a vision basically but it was a reality to him right but that's going to happen to you and I we've got to take a strong hand of faith and do the same thing all right and that's what happened to him Revelations 5 he comes in and says Okay God says this is the sword of the king not only do you have to have to fit your hand but you also got to have enough strong faith to put it to the heart of the enemy all right so in other words we've had the word for a long time right in our possession in our hands but now you we're gonna have to do something that has never been done before the enemies always struck to our uh flesh heart physical heart because we're dying right that's everywhere well that's Satan he's took that sword and he's had a stronger hand because of what happened in the garden he's been a squatter but he's not the mighty conqueror that's right you can't get to your spiritual heart but he can take that natural heart down right right man's hearts are failing for fear you know the Bible says in the end time and you see people fall right and left even young people now that are dying heart attacks and things like that that's right but it takes a strong hand of faith to bring it to the heart of the enemy so what we're doing we're getting it back we're getting our full Authority back right and that's what he's to me what brother random does now it's not brother random it's really God it's the Holy Ghost talking to me and you right right because remember these people sitting here listening to this message right here did not understand anything this man was talking about right now that's not my opinion we're going to read over here in questions and answers where he said you're not getting it not supposed to and it's already left you right it's already left you right and the questions and answers when he first started talking he said in paragraph 13 all of your conscious and know that there is something mysterious happening and it is happening and I know what it is now I'm just not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's no way in the world for you to see it right so this was written to me and you specifically right all the people that are dead can't read that of course the people 1965 till now has read it that died not ashamed we're in disgrace but there's somebody gonna have to take this once this Prophet said that's right and not mimic it but be it all right because you're going to read we're going to read in the questions and answers maybe we'll do that next Sunday the questions and answers before he gets started he made some very outstanding statements but what he was doing he what brother Brown would do what God would do through this Prophet was he'd build a foundation remember reservable supposed to build a foundation right now you don't just leave the foundation where it is they didn't go Enoch didn't go take that pyramid and just build a foundation and then leave he built a building on top of it right all right that's what God's going to do he's going to build a building on top of it the statue of a perfect man but that building can't be complete without the cop sitting on it and that's what's been gone and left after all all the years but what God does in this book more than any that I see all right and God is Simplicity God is planting a seed amen it's going to be simple all right in the breach he's showing you that it's Redemption then he begins to open the seals and then he opens one comes back and tells you about one on number two and then he opens two comes back and tells you what he's doing he's coming back on that Foundation again laying it he's not laying it again he's just building on top of it right that's right remember Paul said not laying again the foundation of water baptism and all that when brother Brown gets to this he's past that that's why he's saying questions and answers he said I'm sure you're not getting it coach one of the questions we're still on water baptism should I wear a pajamas to bed you know the greatest time in the face of history since Jesus Christ has been on Earth that one week was the greatest time in history and they're asking about wearing pajamas to bed so it probably gave him a very very um humbling and uh to me I'd have probably threw up my hands and left but the thing that hurt me was he specifically asked he said ask questions right about what we're talking about this week and he got one or two out of 25. maybe the pajama right the pajama lady wasn't there but you know brother Brown will listen to The Prophet though he says this is serious he said there he said every question is important and he answered every one of them at length he didn't just say all that so Steely y'all wear what you know he covered it in length you know about you know this and that you know today whatever you wear in your bedroom that's your business you just don't do it outside don't think I know you're not supposed to wear a garment thing to a man all right so that's all he said all right so but watch what he's doing here in this Revelation chapter five he's building a foundation and God is building it through this Prophet by putting a sword in his hand telling us what it's going to taste he's gone in God in Simplicity is telling us how to defeat the Devil wherein back in the old times where there wasn't enough word to do that you didn't have a prophet on the scene man was doing just what brother Adam said they were floundering around they were presuming well maybe this is right well maybe that's right well we're going to baptize this way we're going to baptize this way we're going to believe that three God three Gods one God but when you come down to this man right here during that week that breach is important because that breach is part of the foundation right If You Don't See Redemption in the seal you have missed every bit of it and they didn't see that in here they just saw that he realized and now we know that the white horse rider is not the Holy Ghost it's the devil it's a lot deeper than that because you can read that with your brain but remember he told us this was a love book read between the lines okay love letter okay and this was a love letter that that God brought which was the Bible but then he gave us Grace and brought us a prophet to where he could literally read between the lines now we got to read between his lines but it's got to be the same on top the same on the bottom it can't be a different Revelation that's right okay this book The Sound of silk did not bring something called polygamy and all that other junk that they're talking about in the message it brought Redemption to this by from this Bible to me and you and made it alive that's what it's supposed to do right so that's why he did this with brother Brown and put that strong hand of faith strong sword then he begins and says in in number 19 he says because I do not know what the first runner is I don't know the second third fourth fifth sixth or seventh seal all right and now if you'll catch something else look at look at paragraph 20 should be on page 62 right at the top of the page he says you know in Visions you cannot reveal things until they are permitted to reveal now remember he'd have a vision of somebody in a room and there'd be two people in the room and they would be a hat laying on the couch well he'd walk into that room naturally and he see the two people but he didn't see the hat right so he just sat down and started talking to the people maybe he said the baby was crying and all that stuff and just barely breathing and all that stuff but he could not do anything until that vision go ahead Vision was complete in other words until what God saw because what what is a vision is foretelling something it's going to take place well where'd that come from that had to come from the mind of God if it was from God Visions are not always from God but this Vision was right because it was in the word so he said you know he waited about 10 minutes 15 minutes and finally somebody walks in takes his hat off lays it on account he says okay the vision's complete and he said now I can pray for the baby say West same thing with this right here every part's got to be in its place for these seals to have opened and that why do you think he starts talking about stuff like that because he's telling us something because look keep reading you know invisions you cannot reveal things until they are permitted to reveal how many times have you all heard me say go into a house perhaps a hat laying here and this certain child so forth will not be healed until that's late over here I cannot tell them or neither can I move it there it's got to be moving some other way somebody else he's telling us he can't do it he's telling us right here he cannot physically go move that hat someone else has to do it he physically cannot reveal this to you you got to get it right you got to put the hat in the right place and you know what unconsciously the man moved the Hat it wasn't cause it wasn't because he was part of the vision and he knew if he didn't move I have no the guy that walked in or the lady or whoever was they picked that hat up and moved it they were just doing it by night they were just being natural I said God is simplicity exactly yeah exactly because what is the vision it's showing something that was in God's mind before the foundational world if it's of God because God's already saw it happen right you and I cannot look in the future and see something that hasn't happened we're not capable as human beings to do that right all right but God's already seen it so he just brought the prophet brought him up a little higher than everybody else so he could see out and dropped him down and said hey this has got to happen before this is gonna this baby can't be healed it's not that the baby's healing was based on the hat but it was the situation the atmosphere that was created the the the play that the act of the play so all these people had to be in the right place right see you know what was wrong with this right here the people weren't in the right place I said the people weren't in the right place you and I weren't sitting there most of us were not born I was but most of y'all weren't born okay 1965 63 I mean but that was the problem that's what he's telling the people he said if you're spiritual all during the whole week he said you were he said if you're watching you'll know what I'm doing what was he doing he was telling them listen somebody else has to take it and move it and everything in order then it can be revealed all right so now be in prayer so he starts praying okay now 23 now now we're going to turn to the fifth chapter now this is not the seven seal just to breach between the church ages and the seventh seal we're talking about Tom yesterday and it's true it's a very true statement the seals and the ages compare to each other they don't parallel one's not one twos not two threes not three right you understand yes seal one parallels really one two and three right okay seal number two parallel when the in the Dark Ages seal three parallels in Lutheran Wesley seal four in this age because Rapture takes place on the fourth seal so we're getting way ahead of ourselves so just erase that out of your mind jury thank you those lawyers are smart how are you going to raise that at your memory you'll remember it now so we get finished in December of 2012. right now keep that in your mind because that's what it's coming to all right it's not the seven seal just a breach between the church ages and the seventh seal so the seals were shown down Through the Ages so brother Brown had to bring the breach because debris what happened during the ages there was one common factor in all the ages the word was revealed to a group of people and they were born again to me that you can just ask your that's your foundation for us to talk about but their body was not redeemed but the seals open and the ages showing that white horse rider riding out making everybody religious the Red Horse Road out killing the ones that that were you know that were against the Catholic Church number three coming out with death which was during Lutheran Wesley's time it was spiritual death more than natural death all right and then in the end time here we are with all of them mixed together and we had a prophet tell us his name his name's death which is what anti-word Antichrist anti against the word of God right so that's what he's trying to that's what I'm telling you now so you can set a foundation excuse me to where when we go start into the breach which is now you'll see that this is all the foundation for the seal that doesn't have anything to do with co123 but without this breach you can't get into the seal you got to be born again to understand right okay so you gotta have Redemption right and that's the common factor in all the church ages um this one had a word for the day this one this other one had a word different not a different word but a different part of the word you understand what I'm saying when I say a different word it's not a different word it's just more of it and then it got to eat down to less of it right okay it wasn't that they they throw the Bibles away no what happened was people began to preach their own Doctrine and that eroded the word of God to where people couldn't it just made it just it made a uh a crust around people so you got in uh Columbus age that it almost went completely out why Catholic church trying to kill all 68 million Protestant all right um and then it started back in Lutheran Westland all right so in this breach brother Branham had to breach the church ages to the seals all right when he brought that in then he brought it together then he could start on the first seal the angel could come down on on that date and give him the Revelation all right now let's go to let's do 24 because he's he's getting these things out of the way watch him he he's he's wiping that Foundation off but somebody some people in the message use this Foundation very wrong and there was a fourth chapter rather of Revelations and in that it kind of revealed something that would take place after the church going up the church goes up in the third chapter of Revelations and does not return to the 19th Chapter of Revelation therefore the church misses the tribulation right so the literal happenings from from chapter four actually it starts from chapter six because remember four and five is the scene in heaven it's already finished John's caught up through the open door right right shown the bride shown the four at four 20 Elders the Beast all that the the the four combat beasts shows all that in four like I've always said I'll say it again chapter at the end of chapter three when you start chapter four that tells of the rapture chapter 4 shows us in heaven chapter five shows us how we got there you say how chapter 4 shows us around the throne praising God throwing our crowns down doing all that it's done it's finished it's over then God goes and says hey this is the reason you were here he goes back to Revelation 5 and goes back to John where there's no man Worthy in other words he's saying the reason you got here you aren't worthy that was one man Worthy Jesus Christ and that's the one that we're seeing going around the throne in chapter four raising and throwing our crowns and screaming and hollering but John had to see total redemption in chapter five because remember John was a born-again believer John was a born-again Believer from 80 33 to 1890 that was 60 some odd years remember he was a little young boy when Jesus picked him probably 17 18 years old in 1833 or 80 30 when Jesus was crucified all right so 60 years later he's probably 78 or 80 years old out there on this island going through all this so he had been born again for 60 years yet he's weeping he's born again he's in heaven he's being caught up to the greatest event in history but he's caught crying weak not John your body's gonna make it see that's a lot in Revelation 5 that you can you can body change is in there all those things that's in Revelation 5. that's why brother Brown said we had to get to this it's breach to get our mind really now listen to me to the end to get our mind out of the ages because remember if you're a bride today we're caught up out of the age right we're not in this age we're in this age physically but we're going to be caught up out of the age to understand that it's not just getting born again and living a good Christian life anymore that's what he told them to do in 1963. remember he said go on live a good simple Christian Life pay your time go to church that's good we do that but we are required a little bit more amen that's to see that where John was weeping he was weeping because no man was worthy there was no flesh flesh Worthy that's why when he turned to see a lion he saw what Jesus Christ the son of man he was the bloody lamb the son of man right and when he saw him take that book he knew it was back in the hands of the rifle owner right remember God took it away from Adam the ability to produce us in flesh bodies to become Eternal correct God held on to that book until this passage of scripture that was God setting on that throne right Son of God Spirit God down Through the Ages then the lamb comes out from behind the throne the prophet said back in his mediatorial work what being a mediator between what God and man scripture says it's a man Christ Jesus what would Prophet said he was down through the church ages bringing out a bride but when he comes around and takes that book see that's a little different because when he takes the book he's in full possession of it then that's right all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me Jesus was prophesying of what was happening to himself and then also a group of people because after that they had a Pentecostal Revival right because John saw that if one man was Worthy then everybody that believed on that man God wrote part of the scripture remember John wrote the Book of John and little John so he knew something about what Jesus was about but when he saw that man take that book he knew the hand the book was back in the hand of the rifle owner now he took ages to get there that was 80 60 something or 80 90. and now we're in 2011. but it took a long time to get a group of people on the Earth that would believe it a group of people that would believe that in Revelations 5 it's not just four in your soul because remember blinded John that's important why did John weep why we wouldn't you know today we Rejoice because we're born again right right but when John was in a vision seeing that that if somebody didn't get that book back see John live way back in the Book of Genesis he was way back there in the book right way back there in God's mind remember he was caught up John was caught up right to see what was what is and what is to come right so he saw what was he saw what happened in the garden he knew what happened in the garden he read the scroll he was a born-again believer but he saw people still dying see John was still a human being right and though he was caught up in heaven he was still human he knew people were dying he knew he was on his Road out being close to 80 years old right that's why he was weeping everybody said well he didn't see his name or did see a week ago he wept because he was a human being knew that there was something had to happen different right not a different New Birth but something had to happen to that old man that was born of a man and a woman or they were going to continue to just keep dying and dying and dying but why John shouted he saw somebody physically taped that book and then John could look down through time I believe and he'd see a bride because remember he he typed us right The Whole World's groaning and waiting right waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God right that was what Paul wrote and I'm sure John read a lot of Paul's writings because when John left the Isle of Palms where'd he go he went to Ephesus and he pastored the church he pastored Paul's church after Paul was killed in 80 60 something um John comes back and pastors the church in Ephesus after Paul that week you don't think he sat there and read Paul's writings I believe he did sure and I believe the people that were there knew what Paul said because they were sitting there the same you know Ephesus was a mighty mighty group of people they were they were strong in faith but let's get back to this but so what brother Brown showed us was that John had to see something let me go back the bride John when I say John you think of the Bride right right from now on when I say John we've not gone we've not bride the land of the propaganda now he has prevailed but when the lamb took the book he's the one that sat down on the throne the reason he sat down on the throne it's because he overcome that's right Revelation 3 14-23 he said he that over cometh shall do what sit down with me in my Throne as I have let me let me interpolate took the book I sat down on my father's time because see he sat down through he was Son of God down through the church ages it wasn't son of man the Son of God Revelation remember the spirit of God flesh kept dying that's what happened John was looking he sees this right here now we know it's still happening today so John was looking way out in the prophetic come on brother random gets here we ain't got far enough yet so look at number 25. those things we just are presuming in other words if somebody doesn't take the book open the sales or just presume it because what he's going to tell us a little bit later he said we're going to come right back here to this scripture next Sunday night and next Sunday night was what when the seventh seal broke he's in here somewhere because I wrapped those things down but uh we'll find it next week this is kind of way on over but he reads the scripture and this is what he says in number in paragraph 29 . excuse me this seven seal book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of Revelations 10. now if you're marking it down let's turn to Revelations 10 just a moment so you'll get an understanding before we get into it all right so another Mighty Angel which is Christ come down from heaven clothed with a cloud of rainbow upon his head if you notice that's Christ see because he in the Old Testament was called the angel of the Covenant and he is directly coming to the Jews now for the church is finished all right now that throws people loot let me talk to you for about two minutes brother Brown says the church goes up in Revelations three not seen the Revelation 19 the bride that's physically true because we physically go on a Rapture at the timeline of Revelation 4. then he goes to the Jews correct so these seals are for the Jews right Revelation Revelation 6 through 19 or through 18 is for the Jews okay he's praying the Lord okay okay my cheerleader great job right now but uh that book had to be in her hand of the original owner before the seal could be broken right had to be in the hand of the region alone now brother Brandon wants him and you notice that's Christ because he in the Old Testament was called the angel Covenant and he's directly coming to the Jews now for the church is finished so everybody's like well brother Brown's got to come back this is where they get the return management brother Brian's got to come back because Revelations 10 everybody's gone but he's got to come back and reveal the Mysteries before he goes with the Jews but he's done doing that see as they listen as they miss Jesus's first coming so they're going to miss your second camp and his second coming his first coming was introduced by John the Baptist his second coming was introduced by Elijah or William Brown they missed them all remember they're going to miss them all right who is this John guy we thought he was the last or one of the prophets or something no he was one crying in the wilderness Jesus put him in the scripture brother Branham Malachi four that's why we go to Malachi four to see that God sent you Elijah the prophet all right so this is to the Jews physically this will happen when we leave here when I say this I mean the seal right but I hold this book up I'm in the seal all right and this book is totally physically open we will not be here but if we don't get the spiritual opening of these we will be here if you're not born again now if you're born again and you miss this that's okay that's all right you can come to a certain level and and dangle by the grain I'm talking about the people it's going to stand and there will be no death right none at all we were talking yesterday coming just for example yesterday um about um certain things when we see the Dead Come among us and we see the dead because remember the dead in Christ shall rise first they'll get their glorified body first so what comes what comes out of mind your mouth it's going to bring them out of that ground but we're still going to be in Mom and Daddy's old body when I say Mom and Daddy's the one that brought you here we're still going to be in a sinful condition of a flesh body that's going to hurt that's going to but once we see those dead Saints what more confidence how is death going to have a hold on you when you call somebody right and they're in a glorified body not somebody like Lazarus is going to die again or somebody that somebody drops dead and we pray for him it's just a cat and she comes back to life well you know what 40 years from now she's going to be dead when they when they come Among Us in that way and they're in their glorified body I promise you one thing if you can see them if you can see them and you're still alive you better believe one thing death has been destroyed that's right and you're part of it that's right and it won't be just a few days or whatever hours it doesn't matter but you'll be changed because Paul said we which are alive and remains shall be changed so brother Danny what comes out of our mouth has got to bring them out of the ground give them the glorified body and then change our body if you see it in that process there's nothing going to stop you that's right that's when that death will crawl up your sleeve and you'll just brush it off because if what you said brought that there's no way you can be stopped Satan can throw everything he can against you and there's no way to stop no way Lord from where I stopped with the breeze read about maybe four or five pages that way it'll keep it fresh and you must treat him up for my face last time I mean we'll cover and everything
