[10:14] Peter 1:13 we've been on this now the
[10:17] Lord willing I said you know how that
[10:21] works out I
[10:22] said the Lord willing we'll try to wind
[10:25] up this series on this and the
[10:28] revelation of Jesus Christ this coming
[10:31] Wednesday night we'll try to bring it to
[10:33] a close so if you have any questions
[10:36] points or thoughts you know write them
[10:40] down and turn them in if you can before
[10:42] Wednesday night because what I want to
[10:44] finally put a final climax on true the
[10:48] point of what we've been talking about
[10:50] and it will be covering the son of man
[10:54] all right so that's where it will be
[10:56] coming down to to see I'm gonna try to
[11:00] if you'll watch the message just one not
[11:03] run through it and I'll tell you what
[11:06] I'm gonna preach Wednesday but then you
[11:09] know we'll go back slower to to do the
[11:12] other thing so just watch what's what's
[11:14] happening I try to do that to make you
[11:16] to work that you'll think about
[11:18] something and then when I say so oh yeah
[11:20] I remember that I remember this you know
[11:22] and that way we won't have to spend so
[11:24] much time
[11:25] trying to emphasize points and thoughts
[11:28] okay father we thank you for your grace
[11:31] and we love you now bless your word in
[11:33] Jesus name
[11:36] we're gird up the loins of your mind be
[11:39] sober and hope to the end for the grace
[11:41] that is to be brought unto you at the
[11:44] revelation of
[11:45] Jesus Christ
[11:47] all right now remember that's our point
[11:49] that's been our thought for
[11:52] 11 messages on
[11:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ okay now
[12:00] we'll go over to this day in the
[12:02] overcomer to this age which is
[12:05] revelation 321 to him that overcometh
[12:08] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[12:11] even as I also overcame him and sat down
[12:15] with my father in his throne either have
[12:18] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[12:20] saith unto the churches you may be
[12:23] seated the Lord have his
[12:26] way with the message we
[12:29] trying to
[12:31] get the point across
[12:34] been driving it all the way through
[12:37] and getting into the church ages and I
[12:42] hope this will bring a thought to you
[12:46] that will help you to understand wage
[12:50] approach to the CEOs and the things like
[12:53] that because now it's not a direct quote
[12:57] but it's it's in there enough to where
[12:59] we will be able to use the point or I'll
[13:02] make it for my own self either either
[13:04] way doesn't matter but you see that lamb
[13:07] has to come forth to take the book
[13:12] right now where does it come forward
[13:14] from
[13:15] so that'll be our point this coming
[13:18] Wednesday to try to mold all of what
[13:20] we've been talking about into a one
[13:23] point message and try to express it to
[13:26] work that we can see hey we've got a
[13:29] visitor with us yeah hey
[13:36] she's the little one with us John and my
[13:39] grandbaby
[13:41] we appreciate her being with us today
[13:43] Amen
[13:45] but we're trying to get the point across
[13:49] because it said
[13:51] the the lamb has to come from some work
[13:55] where does it come
[13:58] and then we said well well that's
[14:00] nothing Jesus is the lamb that's all
[14:03] right but how does it come forth into
[14:06] this day because you know we need to
[14:09] know the hour that we're living and what
[14:13] we're doing okay and that'll bring forth
[14:17] the thought okay now
[14:19] to not spend much background on what
[14:22] we've been talking about but to say this
[14:24] the point that
[14:27] each age we cover to how the each age
[14:31] had an overcomer all right there's an
[14:35] overcomer in each age all right but
[14:38] remember that the overcomer of each age
[14:43] inherits
[14:44] now I hope you listen to what I was
[14:48] saying on that
[14:49] you know because it's not just if we get
[14:53] one thing because we're in this age and
[14:56] this one gets another thing called this
[14:58] in that age it is a characteristic or a
[15:01] thought to that age or a point of
[15:04] understanding of that age and all right
[15:07] there's a you know it deals with each
[15:10] age as an as a the Bride of Christ of
[15:13] that age will remember all of it then
[15:17] comes down to this age
[15:19] that's why they without us cannot be
[15:22] made perfect see it comes to this age
[15:24] and this age then will inherit all
[15:27] things but that doesn't mean that back
[15:29] those back to God don't inherit see we
[15:32] all inherit all things according to
[15:35] Revelation we went over about 21
[15:37] somewhere in there were he says we in
[15:40] her at all times all right yeah see that
[15:43] away you say yeah but there's no I'm
[15:46] talking about eternal life I'm talking
[15:49] about the basis of
[15:52] Christianity talking about like oh
[15:55] there's one brother brother if it's the
[15:59] 11th hour people
[16:02] remember the 11th hour people
[16:05] they get the full day the full pay just
[16:11] like the others get right so now that's
[16:14] what we're trying to emphasize the word
[16:18] is not going to be one age one people
[16:21] over here well you don't have as much as
[16:23] we do now you're not gonna be there can
[16:27] I say it that away with that attitude
[16:29] that thought you're not going to be
[16:31] there I think if it's all coded wouldn't
[16:35] matter to me harder where I get to sit
[16:37] and we we covered it emphasize it we're
[16:40] brother Brennan said how can I overcome
[16:42] he said it's not on my throne but in my
[16:48] throne
[16:49] yeah it's not going to be because
[16:52] there's just one according to
[16:53] revelations for will read that Lord
[16:56] willing Sunday I mean Wednesday
[16:58] revelations for it comes to throne one
[17:01] on the throne you say yeah but don't you
[17:04] think that would be said now we're not
[17:07] going to sit on the throne like
[17:10] that form of thing like here's a
[17:13] it'd be impossible if you had a king and
[17:18] you had his subjects right you would
[17:22] have a king with a great big throne
[17:24] nobody else is sitting on it his
[17:27] subjects that are entitled to think are
[17:30] off to the side of that sitting around
[17:33] right okay but that's not sitting in
[17:36] that chair that position does never to
[17:40] be no one sit there but the Lord Jesus
[17:43] Christ himself no he's the only one that
[17:47] has any right to sit on that throne okay
[17:50] so then the prophets right when he said
[17:53] it's not all the throne
[17:55] but he said it's in the throne all right
[17:59] in the throne is in the baptism of the
[18:01] Holy Ghost the new birth the kingdom
[18:05] that Jesus spoke of while he was here
[18:08] and bringing it down and bringing that
[18:11] to show a kingdom a domain a
[18:15] kingdom right
[18:17] alright see then it's to sit in because
[18:21] that way each one of us
[18:23] will be seated in the throne and when
[18:29] you see it in Revelations which we
[18:32] probably drop off from five because five
[18:34] is actually the opening to the seal so I
[18:36] don't want to go that far I just wanted
[18:38] to go into chapter four and pick up the
[18:41] point because that way we can sit in his
[18:44] throne in the baptism of the holy ghost
[18:49] right so that's not sitting on the
[18:52] throne he's emphasizing that because as
[18:55] I said now you just think of it they
[18:57] can't be but one King
[19:01] well where the Queen we've sent with him
[19:04] we're not the Queen never set on the
[19:07] throne
[19:09] she says beside of him that's fine she's
[19:12] got her own place and position that's
[19:15] fine but she don't get on the throne
[19:17] with him because I'm just naturally
[19:19] carnal and stupid I know that would you
[19:22] realize how many millions of the Bride
[19:25] of Christ would be had to be sitting in
[19:27] one room and I'll just make it to where
[19:31] you can think about it is sensible the
[19:34] King has his throne and his subjects are
[19:38] all around him so that way it doesn't
[19:41] matter to me where I said
[19:42] let me have the least in all of the
[19:45] plain but just let me sit in this
[19:47] because listen to sit in is throne you
[19:52] don't have to wait till that day
[19:55] now if you're thinking of sitting on
[19:57] this throne you're waiting for something
[20:00] else
[20:01] then you have to wait till that throne
[20:04] comes into being
[20:06] right but if you're sitting in his
[20:09] throne
[20:10] you realize this already and call this
[20:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you the
[20:17] hope of glory all right now does
[20:19] everybody follow the point so it's not
[20:21] only strong it's in his throne okay
[20:25] now that way the new birth is in every
[20:29] age
[20:31] it was the Holy Ghost in every age the
[20:34] prophet Gil honor ever age had the
[20:37] message every age had the overcoming
[20:41] part sure
[20:43] all right it was in each age it was all
[20:46] the way down so it's the Holy Ghost in
[20:48] every age
[20:49] now all right we have to say this
[20:52] because it's truthful but hard to
[20:54] explain how
[20:56] can you degree the the ghost I mean can
[21:01] you count the ocean and get a spoonful
[21:06] you've got the same ingredients right
[21:08] are you with me you got the same
[21:11] ingredients it's just according to the
[21:13] amount all right now I know and
[21:18] understand that or hope I do that like
[21:21] Luther names who are they there were
[21:23] Trinitarians they were were believing
[21:25] things that were wrong we get they're
[21:28] part of the body of Christ you can't put
[21:31] them out because of that given the new
[21:33] birth to each age
[21:35] alright see then as you've given the new
[21:38] birth then that age will stand forth and
[21:41] be the correct thing because I know I'm
[21:44] Coronel
[21:46] in my expression but there's something
[21:49] about it when I do express it you can't
[21:52] express it no other way because if he's
[21:54] in the midst of the seven golden
[21:55] candlesticks that had put him in more in
[21:58] the middle and it would any horse else
[21:59] that's his carnal as you're thinking so
[22:02] I just think carnal William tell you
[22:04] that don't work it simply means he's a
[22:07] never Church age he's happy to be any he
[22:10] was just as happy to be in Luther's age
[22:12] he is he is in this age are the first
[22:15] age all right is that clear enough to
[22:18] keep our point okay now did you just
[22:22] pick up a little little thought
[22:24] because that's what we want to do
[22:26] because we're talking about in his
[22:28] throne all right now brother Branham
[22:31] says God came in three sons names
[22:36] all right
[22:37] no I know he came in three in four
[22:42] titles
[22:43] you can pick that up but he came in
[22:46] three sons names
[22:48] all right and then that is son of God
[22:52] our rivers technically starting son of
[22:55] man
[22:56] son of God son of David that's the three
[23:01] sons names that he comes in to manifest
[23:05] he came as son of man to fulfill the
[23:09] scriptures because the prophets were
[23:11] called son of man
[23:14] right
[23:16] Jeremiah and all of them son of man okay
[23:19] now they were not the son of man
[23:23] they were a son of man
[23:26] all right because he is the son of man
[23:30] okay now that solves that problem that
[23:34] we don't have to worry about what this
[23:36] and that is we try to know that it's
[23:39] just get the straight story the Son of
[23:42] Man is the Lord Jesus Christ a son of
[23:46] man is a prophet in the
[23:49] set aside for the brain of the word for
[23:52] the time and the ages and the points to
[23:55] be brought all right now but think about
[23:58] it
[24:00] he came in three sons named
[24:04] because that would be the correct order
[24:08] the son of man
[24:12] prophet
[24:14] come in that form to give his life
[24:19] was more than just a prophet right
[24:23] that's why he never referred to himself
[24:25] as son of God he always referred to
[24:28] himself as son of man because he was
[24:30] fulfilling the office all right
[24:33] according to John what at 1:14 and the
[24:36] Word was made flesh
[24:40] all right now so he was the fulfillment
[24:43] of the word as we'll get to in a minute
[24:45] where the Prophet I wish you I wrote it
[24:47] down I wish you would read this or
[24:49] listened to the message called birth
[24:51] pains then you wouldn't be confused when
[24:53] I make a statement like this to say the
[24:56] prophets gave birth to the word because
[25:00] they were the word of their age
[25:02] they gave birth to the word what was
[25:05] that one day that word stood on earth in
[25:07] human flesh
[25:08] called the Lord Jesus Christ all right
[25:12] now so then watch the point now and
[25:15] listen and as I said I'm going to put it
[25:18] in the message but I'm not going to
[25:20] express it so then would it not be
[25:23] then
[25:26] that the church ages would give birth if
[25:30] the Old Testament gave birth to Jesus
[25:33] Christ the Son of Man
[25:36] would it not be that the church ages
[25:38] would give birth to Jesus Christ again
[25:41] that's one of the things that people
[25:43] this message is not looking at
[25:46] they only look at it as this or that or
[25:48] that point or this point they don't look
[25:51] at it that's the prophet brought it
[25:54] see then that way the church ages
[25:58] will give birth to
[26:01] the Lamb
[26:07] so I said you're you're not listening to
[26:11] try to understand you're listening to
[26:13] refute
[26:16] because now where are you gonna put this
[26:18] on a man
[26:27] because you only have three sons named
[26:30] you have son of man
[26:34] which was the Lord Jesus Christ and on
[26:37] the earth and the thing and may I say
[26:40] this is a point I thought he preached
[26:43] six seals
[26:45] in Matthew 24 I thought he was the Lamb
[26:49] that
[26:51] John says behold the Lamb of God that
[26:54] takes away the sin of the world I
[26:57] thought that was the way we need to do
[26:59] so then that lamb has got to be the same
[27:02] Lamb that takes the book
[27:05] okay
[27:07] see that's where we got to hold that
[27:09] point and then we'll drop back to it
[27:11] Wednesday to emphasize a lot to go with
[27:14] it all right
[27:15] now
[27:18] three sons name he comes first
[27:21] to redeem the bride
[27:24] he comes second like it's a rapture to
[27:29] take away his bride he comes third with
[27:33] his bride Ken Queens they've caught into
[27:35] the Millennium all right now three sons
[27:39] names now how are you going to fit that
[27:45] how are you going to express that
[27:52] because you got three sons done
[27:55] these son of man
[27:59] down to seven church ages he's son of
[28:02] God
[28:03] now these are laying here if you need
[28:05] them your prophet said it if you know
[28:08] the message then no and
[28:13] then son of David
[28:16] all right
[28:18] now I'll ask this question and I've been
[28:22] at it for 40 years so this is not new
[28:27] how does he go from son of God
[28:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[28:33] church ages
[28:35] to the son of David in the Millennium
[28:40] now can you do that
[28:47] well if David is
[28:50] Jesus Christ brother branham said
[28:53] physically a human being sitting on the
[28:59] throne in the Millennium that son of
[29:03] David
[29:06] and it's easy to understand how you can
[29:09] go from Son of Man the
[29:11] Son of God
[29:14] because son of man was God made manifest
[29:17] in the human vessel
[29:21] the Redeemer the The
[29:24] Book of Ruth you know the kinsman
[29:28] redeemer and he had to give his life
[29:33] and He gave His life to be able to
[29:37] release what was within him
[29:40] he didn't have to give his life because
[29:42] they said he gave his life because the
[29:45] that was within him now watch what I'm
[29:49] saying so listen carefully and don't
[29:51] misunderstand me as he was walking on
[29:54] earth he was son of man
[29:58] when he gave His life that release that
[30:03] Holy Ghost that was within him
[30:06] right
[30:08] and that could come back on the day of
[30:10] Pentecost
[30:12] the new birth
[30:13] that's why it goes to son of God
[30:17] the Jesus didn't say was son of God he
[30:20] said he was son of man that was his
[30:22] earthly ministry
[30:23] and what he come to make manifest not to
[30:27] just die
[30:28] that was part of it when he came to
[30:31] release that life life that was within
[30:35] him to be able to come back on the
[30:39] believer to give that believer the new
[30:42] birth and put that believer in
[30:49] in
[30:51] the new birth in the kingdom
[30:55] in the Father's throne
[31:00] he's a human father strong yeah
[31:07] in the father's strong
[31:10] because the Father's throne is the
[31:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm
[31:14] reading these if you want to
[31:19] father's strong is the baptism of the
[31:23] Holy Ghost that's why Jesus said
[31:28] there in the
[31:30] revelation sit with me in that's
[31:33] red-letter that's him speaking right sit
[31:36] with me in my throne as I have overcome
[31:40] and sit with my father
[31:42] in his throne
[31:45] all right watch the Father's throne
[31:49] it's the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[31:53] but that's not Jesus is throne
[31:57] that's why he couldn't grant to that
[31:59] woman that wanted one of her sons
[32:02] sitting on one side one the other
[32:03] because it didn't belong to him
[32:10] the kamon listen
[32:12] his throne is the son of David
[32:21] his throne is the son of David
[32:26] which is the promise
[32:29] that he would sit on his Father's throne
[32:32] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[32:34] because he's released the life and that
[32:37] could come and he comes and lives in us
[32:39] what do you have in you by the new birth
[32:42] that's where the Trinitarians really
[32:44] don't like us that way because they
[32:46] don't like me saying it I did see you
[32:48] realized the new birth in you gives you
[32:50] Father Son and Holy Ghost dwelling
[32:52] inside of you
[32:55] know I've just got the holy spirit
[33:00] more your good Trinitarian
[33:04] Father Son and Holy Ghost is the same
[33:07] Lord Jesus Christ
[33:09] so you have within you the new birth
[33:13] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[33:16] Laura
[33:18] because that's what it makes manifest in
[33:20] the you know try unity not Trinity of
[33:25] God all right now
[33:29] see them to come as to be how can he get
[33:33] to the Millennium
[33:37] you know
[33:40] from the son of God and
[33:43] how can you get to the Millennium
[33:51] simple question
[33:53] waves already emphasized this in the
[33:56] seals whatever shows our redemption
[33:59] shows Israel then whatever shows
[34:02] Israel's Redemption shows our Redemption
[34:04] alright so it's a beautiful picture
[34:07] brother branham did this did he make
[34:10] this statement he said the Book of
[34:11] Revelations
[34:14] he said it's
[34:16] acts of a play
[34:24] the Book of Revelations we look at it as
[34:27] symbols and get all blowed out escape
[34:28] and don't understand he said it's the
[34:30] acts of a play
[34:33] now when we get to Revelation 4:1 where
[34:37] brother Adam says the lamb comes forth
[34:41] takes the book
[34:45] climbs up on the throne and sets down
[34:49] what did the father get up
[34:54] he said comes the one on the throne
[34:59] Polly said
[35:03] that he comes forth
[35:06] comes around takes the book climbs up on
[35:09] the throne and sits down and said I'm
[35:11] the one that did
[35:15] is that going to move the father off and
[35:18] shove him off and no it's the acts of a
[35:21] play
[35:23] it's
[35:24] manifestation of those
[35:30] not many beings but the one being in
[35:35] many manifestations
[35:39] so we're looking at the church aging so
[35:42] it's it's easier said to follow then the
[35:44] son of man gave His life
[35:49] he never declared himself to be the Son
[35:52] of God
[35:53] his weight kept emphasizing on the day
[35:57] we see Jesus never saved one person
[36:00] while he was on earth
[36:05] do you go to that man hanging on the
[36:09] cross and only said but just remember he
[36:12] had to go from that to son of God to
[36:14] carry him with him the son of man
[36:17] couldn't cure that thief with him
[36:19] no son of God had to so he had to
[36:24] release the life
[36:26] are you following me then
[36:29] he said brother day well we understand
[36:32] this do you understand
[36:38] so he goes from son of man the Word made
[36:41] flesh
[36:43] the next step is a manifestation of the
[36:47] Son of God
[36:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will
[36:53] be that down through 7 Church ages
[36:56] and
[36:57] then Jesus goes to his own throne the
[37:02] son of David called his only three sons
[37:05] name
[37:08] then how can we do that
[37:12] well I mean we just go holy he just go
[37:14] yeah you're not you're
[37:19] not listening
[37:24] you can go from son of man to son of god
[37:29] by him releasing his life
[37:32] okay
[37:35] but you can't go from son of God the Son
[37:39] of David the co son of David is a human
[37:43] person sitting on the throne your
[37:46] prophet said in a human body
[37:55] there is no place statement of porn or
[37:58] cult listen to my statement now there's
[38:01] no place though statements or anything
[38:04] from the prophets message and the Bible
[38:08] that brings a physical
[38:13] Lord Jesus Christ I said it to a minute
[38:17] physical listen
[38:19] he's not here in corporal body
[38:24] we meet him in the air
[38:27] he'll be a corporal body in the
[38:29] Millenium
[38:31] we meet him in the air
[38:34] he does not come here physically so
[38:38] there's no scripture point out of the
[38:40] prophets message to try to bring that
[38:43] son of man and wedge it back in some way
[38:46] and be careful how you would even try to
[38:49] do it
[38:52] because if you make brother branham Dee
[38:55] son of man
[38:59] he said you'd make him an antichrist
[39:04] he's a son of man to make known decent
[39:09] of man
[39:11] it has got to be a son of man
[39:14] he's got to come back to son of man in
[39:17] the last days
[39:21] be careful how you bring him back
[39:24] like I've always said you have no
[39:27] writings you have nothing appalled
[39:29] petering them trying to explain you got
[39:32] Matthew Mark Luke and John with the Lord
[39:35] Jesus on earth and him saying I'm the
[39:38] son of man Paul Peter and out of them
[39:40] and their writings nobody mentioned the
[39:43] son of man
[39:45] jumps over to John
[39:51] yeah listen there's John in the Book of
[39:55] Revelations ever talk about the Son of
[39:58] Man
[40:01] he talks about 1-lakh Under the Sun man
[40:07] because there's no corporal there's no
[40:09] physical
[40:11] when he released that life dire on earth
[40:15] that made way for the son of God right
[40:19] brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:21] into being
[40:24] now how are you going to get the son of
[40:26] David into being
[40:31] you've got to have the Son of Man to
[40:34] come back
[40:35] right
[40:37] it's got to be there
[40:39] there's got to be there are certain way
[40:42] yeah pull it over stop that so what I
[40:46] said I'm taking it to trying my best to
[40:49] get you for one time to think about what
[40:52] said
[40:53] and
[40:55] listen and ask God to reveal it to you
[40:58] because it's too late
[41:04] you remember when we stood here years
[41:07] ago and I asked you about the son of God
[41:09] when did it come into being and all of
[41:11] you answered and said it came into being
[41:13] 2000 years ago on earth and I said
[41:16] you're out of the scriptures you don't
[41:17] even know what you're talking about they
[41:19] defended 99% of the people in domestic I
[41:22] mean in the building here because they
[41:24] thought I was thrown off on them okay
[41:27] take it that's throwing off on you
[41:30] don't worry about it cuz I ain't trying
[41:33] to satisfy you
[41:36] I'm trying to satisfy him I
[41:42] said you talk about son of man because
[41:44] that was right in the 80s when then the
[41:47] message people started talking about son
[41:49] of man called brother so-and-so started
[41:51] preaching son of man
[41:53] I
[41:56] told you I
[41:58] said
[42:00] you're going at it wrong
[42:02] son of god was spirit God son of God is
[42:07] the first part that come out from God
[42:09] the low cost is theophany and even
[42:13] Scofield and him called it the word
[42:15] the low cost the theophany them they
[42:18] called it the son of God
[42:21] that's why Peter when he said who do men
[42:23] say i the son of man am he said thou art
[42:26] the Christ the Son of the Living God
[42:29] Peter asked him I mean Jesus asked about
[42:32] the son of man he answered about the son
[42:34] of God because that was all that could
[42:36] be answered that was all anybody knew
[42:40] but in a nod
[42:42] none of you writers the great Apostle
[42:45] Paul never mentioned son of man come on
[42:49] church
[42:50] here comes a prophet in the last days
[42:53] that
[42:55] about 47 might have been 49 I seem like
[42:59] the first one I found son of man was 49
[43:03] but it doesn't matter what about 49 here
[43:06] comes an illiterate Mountain hillbilly
[43:10] right no great college education snow
[43:15] degrees no no theological training
[43:18] and he starts talking about son of man
[43:22] and his whole emphasis of his entire
[43:26] message is based on the son of man
[43:30] when he was just trying to tell us who
[43:32] he was he ain't this on a man he never
[43:35] was the son of man
[43:39] he's a son of man making manifest the
[43:42] son of man that's pretty close but it
[43:45] still gotta and still like I said don't
[43:47] get up on the throne and claim your
[43:49] right to say I'm sitting on the throne
[43:51] with him now they but one on that throne
[43:54] they ain't but one D son of man
[44:02] it doesn't say in the scriptures you
[44:05] know a son of management is always
[44:07] decently
[44:09] as the son of man is the Lord Jesus
[44:12] Christ all right
[44:14] through the church ages according to
[44:17] this God changed his mind
[44:21] through the church ages he has been son
[44:24] of God in the Millennium he'd be son of
[44:28] David sitting on the throne
[44:30] but between this time
[44:34] we find out by the scripture
[44:38] he is revealing himself again that son
[44:42] of man look a prophet
[44:49] because it had to come from a prophet
[44:52] we'll get to that Lord within Wednesday
[44:56] the unveiling of God
[44:59] then after the Holy Spirit comes he was
[45:03] then the son of God God is a spirit he
[45:07] was the Holy Spirit son of God he lived
[45:10] through the church ages as son of God
[45:12] now in the Millennium he'll be son of
[45:15] David sitting upon the throne of his
[45:18] father David he is the son of David now
[45:22] Goodwin and
[45:25] remember between the son of God in
[45:29] the lady you see in church a
[45:33] they put him out and in Luke he said he
[45:38] would reveal he would be revealed again
[45:41] a sort of LAN the Prophet fulfilling the
[45:45] rest of it
[45:46] of death what does he do now return as
[45:51] son of man
[45:52] then from that
[45:55] son of David
[45:57] see how close we are son of man son of
[46:00] David son of God he's revealed and in
[46:03] the last days as son of man according to
[46:07] Malachi 4 all the rest of the prophecies
[46:10] pertaining to this hour no more dealing
[46:13] with the church after thee they put him
[46:16] out he he's at the door knocking
[46:20] now we've got a key
[46:24] they said I won't leave this thing
[46:27] because I know what the danger of the
[46:28] point and I'll emphasize it heavily wins
[46:31] did
[46:35] you can't go from son of God
[46:39] the Son of David
[46:42] you said well why not because your
[46:44] prophet just said it
[46:46] now are you gonna believe him
[46:49] they didn't real regardless about me
[46:52] you can say well brother Dale just
[46:54] emphasized inside of there now are you
[46:56] gonna believe him
[46:58] he comes back to wedge in this life days
[47:01] in a specific point of the lady of sin
[47:04] church age
[47:06] showing that he's gonna come back his
[47:09] son of man
[47:11] just for a little while
[47:14] he's gonna be on earth
[47:18] that's none of man
[47:22] sure that had to start with a prophet
[47:25] called his a prophet there would be no
[47:28] way for us to understand it without him
[47:30] a
[47:34] prophet comes to introduce the prophet
[47:38] the Prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:41] brother Branham was not the prophet he
[47:44] was a prophet
[47:45] Jeremiah was not deep prophet he was a
[47:47] prophet
[47:48] now you getting it straight did he say
[47:52] we got to keep those things right he
[47:53] said that's where people couldn't
[47:54] understand it and they missed it
[47:57] you can't keep straight son of God son
[48:00] of man son of David
[48:02] you can't keep it straight without a
[48:05] revelation
[48:07] cause you see it's easy to go from Son
[48:11] of Man the Son of God by the releasing
[48:13] of his life made away
[48:17] but down through 7 Church ages and this
[48:20] is where you're gonna have to get away
[48:22] from your ideas that we ain't got nothin
[48:24] ain't nothing going on
[48:26] you're gonna have to get to the basis
[48:29] somebody
[48:35] somebody is going to become the word
[48:45] none just to pick up
[48:48] see if I found out
[49:00] okay let's just go ahead with it
[49:04] the he's sitting now
[49:08] on the father strong spirit
[49:12] that's what the Book of Revelations
[49:15] shows one sitting on the throne that's
[49:17] the father strong that is not his throne
[49:23] that's the father's from his throne is
[49:25] the millennial reign
[49:27] okay you need that
[49:32] go ahead with number five which is the
[49:35] third seal where he seated now but
[49:39] that's not his throne he
[49:42] did overcome us you'll sit with me in my
[49:45] throne as I have overcome and how sit
[49:49] down on my Father's throne
[49:53] that is not his throne that belongs to
[49:57] the Spirit God Christ
[49:59] the lamb it doesn't belong to him he's
[50:03] the Incarnate God this is the same God
[50:08] okay are you treating him
[50:11] what is the father's from baptism with
[50:14] the Holy Ghost
[50:17] Jesus Christ came into the world as the
[50:21] son of man the Word made flesh verse 14
[50:26] he released his life to where it could
[50:29] come back into and prepare the father
[50:32] strong because that's what he come to do
[50:34] he didn't come to reveal himself am i in
[50:37] the scriptures who did he come to reveal
[50:40] who did Jesus come to revealed the
[50:42] father
[50:45] he said I and my father are one he come
[50:49] to make manifest the father
[50:52] in that he would give up his own life
[50:58] to come back on a dead Pentecost
[51:02] and that baptism of the Holy Ghost is so
[51:05] vital until how are you going to the
[51:09] Millenium
[51:11] are you gonna do it
[51:17] trying to find one specific thought we
[51:21] got to hear some more
[51:26] okay we're over on number 19 so you know
[51:30] we're a long ways over and when the son
[51:34] of man this is off of the mighty Garden
[51:36] unveiled before us and when the Son of
[51:40] Man is being revealed
[51:43] the son of man in in the church again
[51:50] in the church
[51:53] again
[51:57] revealed in human beings
[52:03] not son of God but the son of man again
[52:07] back in his church again in the last
[52:11] days we find that he's promised that in
[52:15] God's promises
[52:20] what about it Church
[52:27] what about
[52:29] an ability now to do what the
[52:33] theologians no one had any thoughts
[52:35] about how
[52:42] are you going to go from son of God
[52:46] to the Millenium
[52:49] you theologians your people your your
[52:52] teachers your denominational hierarchies
[52:55] they know nothing of son of them sort of
[52:58] man right
[52:59] the best they can do was down in Florida
[53:01] they had a group down there not too many
[53:04] years ago that they claimed was a
[53:07] melech high four
[53:09] right
[53:12] where is any of them teaching anything
[53:15] that can get us anywhere
[53:19] I'm gonna hurt your feelings go ahead
[53:22] where is it in the message that it's
[53:24] ever been talked to you how you can go
[53:27] from son of odd - son of David
[53:31] well I didn't know we had to go
[53:34] well did you know you had to go from Son
[53:37] of Man the Son of God
[53:41] did you know that was the vital thing
[53:44] that was in the scripture that
[53:47] God came to give his own life
[53:50] the word could come and live in you and
[53:54] as I said if it's true that the prophets
[53:59] gave birth to the word
[54:04] then the seven church ages has to give
[54:07] birth to the word I
[54:14] thought she was according to
[54:19] Malachi 4 she was to give a new birth
[54:23] she's to be delivered of a new birth
[54:25] that's why I asked you to read birth my
[54:26] she's be delivered of a new birth from
[54:29] according to Monica forward
[54:35] according to Malachi Force used to give
[54:38] a new birth who the bride
[54:41] what is he gonna do she's gonna birth
[54:43] the word
[54:52] now I hope I don't have to Express over
[54:54] and over unless emphases we place in
[54:58] this church upon the basis that brother
[55:00] Branham was the prophet that God used to
[55:03] bring the message and it's not looking
[55:05] for somebody else brother Dale or
[55:08] brother anybody who or what to
[55:11] bring a message to change us I hope
[55:15] that's settled if it ain't you need to
[55:18] find you another church
[55:20] is that plain enough
[55:23] because you know where I stand
[55:27] without this message there's no hope
[55:30] but without this message reveals there's
[55:33] no hope
[55:38] if you heard anybody just ask you a
[55:40] question how are you gonna go from son
[55:43] of God to son of David
[55:47] well I didn't know I needed to go where
[55:50] you do now
[56:01] it's time to get settled down and
[56:02] believe or either we might as well get
[56:04] up and just throw it up and forget it
[56:08] this is not new for me this was the
[56:10] first thing I preached in 1969 and you
[56:14] don't like for me to say that but that
[56:17] was the first sermon I preached was the
[56:19] bride of Jesus Christ would be the son
[56:21] of man these notes coming off of this is
[56:24] taken right out of the front of my Bible
[56:27] because I believe then the Prophet was
[56:30] right
[56:33] sure we could look for Malachi 4
[56:36] remember that's more to Malachi 4 then
[56:39] just brother Branham coming oh
[56:42] there is yeah
[56:47] what about number 22
[56:50] Christ revealed
[56:53] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[56:55] the word and God is the same in his
[56:58] church today
[57:03] making it the headship of the body that
[57:08] is redeemed to
[57:11] bring the message in the last days and
[57:16] be taken up from the dead in the
[57:18] resurrection to go back and restore
[57:21] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[57:27] I
[57:32] didn't say it
[57:36] he said it
[57:39] that the head and body was to you not to
[57:42] bring the message
[57:45] now brother Branham brought the message
[57:47] yeah that's what I'm saying you're not
[57:51] listening you're not studying the
[57:53] message to find Christ
[58:01] what about
[58:03] go 224 the oneness of the unity
[58:16] someday
[58:17] then when the Church of the Living God
[58:20] someday we'll be united under one great
[58:24] head and that will be the head of God
[58:28] God into the unity of the body of Christ
[58:32] will be the governor and King and Lord
[58:35] over the entire church under his control
[58:39] then she will be received up
[58:47] when the head and body you're not
[58:54] do you see why we've been here 50 years
[58:57] since the going of the Prophet because
[59:01] you can't get people to realize what
[59:02] they need
[59:05] what do you mean we study the message we
[59:08] have
[59:10] you've been looking for something
[59:15] ever since I come in this message has
[59:17] never been a goal no a moment to me
[59:19] that's why I tell you that I've been in
[59:21] a revival ever since I come in this
[59:23] message a
[59:25] revival in my heart for the opening of
[59:27] God's Word
[59:29] than to read and believe what your
[59:32] prophet had to say
[59:37] to one
[59:39] someday we'll be united under the great
[59:42] head
[59:42] and that will be the head of God God in
[59:46] the unity of the body of Christ will be
[59:49] the governor in the king
[59:52] what is the lie still morphe of God to
[59:55] the Gentiles
[1:00:03] you say Jesus was the last in Morphy
[1:00:05] your oneness
[1:00:06] because that's what they believe
[1:00:11] they believe Jesus was the last in
[1:00:13] morphe I don't agree with that the bride
[1:00:16] of Jesus Christ is the last in morphe
[1:00:21] in her the Prophet said masterpiece and
[1:00:24] me you won't in her will be the fullness
[1:00:28] of the Godhead bodily
[1:00:30] in her not in one not in one person
[1:00:35] in her the church
[1:00:42] mighty God unveiled before it's number
[1:00:44] 19 how about deity veiled in human flesh
[1:00:48] and when the Son of Man is being
[1:00:52] revealed the Son of Man back in in in
[1:00:57] the church again revealed in human
[1:01:00] beings
[1:01:03] not son of God but the son of man again
[1:01:07] back in his church again in the last
[1:01:09] days we find that he promised that God's
[1:01:13] promises
[1:01:19] what about it
[1:01:26] down got at least a little hope
[1:01:29] maybe you don't take what I'm saying
[1:01:34] I'm saying you gotta have something to
[1:01:36] be able to wedge in between
[1:01:40] so no God and son of David
[1:01:44] your prophet told us what it is
[1:01:48] it's his message
[1:01:51] it's not mine it's not yours
[1:01:54] our brother so and so we're just
[1:01:57] he's put around them some message
[1:02:02] but it has to be given birth
[1:02:06] by bride
[1:02:14] because that will bring the son of man
[1:02:17] back in to be because now I'm going to
[1:02:20] make a few statements another something
[1:02:21] brother Branham is a son of man
[1:02:24] he cannot be the son of man
[1:02:29] now you're gonna make a statement during
[1:02:31] your mind so be careful you're gonna say
[1:02:34] nobody can be the son of man
[1:02:36] I'll agree with you but let me ask you
[1:02:39] if you're gonna agree with me
[1:02:41] how about the entire body of Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ being the son of man
[1:02:50] because no matter what age you was in
[1:02:53] your the Word made flesh
[1:02:56] Martin Luther was the Word made flesh
[1:02:58] for his day John Wesley was the Word
[1:03:01] made flesh for his day you and I are the
[1:03:04] Word made flesh for our day leave out
[1:03:07] anything and you don't have the fullness
[1:03:09] of the Godhead bodily
[1:03:10] and brother Owen said that the Godhead
[1:03:13] is not complete what
[1:03:17] without you
[1:03:19] or me
[1:03:22] because we're part of it
[1:03:25] brother Dan we don't we don't hear you
[1:03:28] we hear your words
[1:03:30] but we don't understand your language
[1:03:34] that's what the scripture said
[1:03:37] they heard his words but couldn't
[1:03:39] understand his language
[1:03:41] paraphrasing that so it may flip-flop
[1:03:43] it's in the scriptures but
[1:03:47] listen
[1:03:50] we've got something to do Church this is
[1:03:54] not just go to church and be good and do
[1:03:57] this that or the other and we
[1:04:01] have something to do
[1:04:04] to become the word
[1:04:10] to become the word
[1:04:16] the prophet has brought the message
[1:04:18] we're not looking for another messenger
[1:04:21] no but he is not the son of man
[1:04:29] with the bride as a whole now listen
[1:04:33] then you know what that makes him part
[1:04:38] of the bride will you listen
[1:04:43] you believe read a random words a
[1:04:45] born-again believer
[1:04:46] you receive you believe he received the
[1:04:49] baptism the Holy Ghost then you burn was
[1:04:51] born into the body of Christ then the
[1:04:53] Godhead is not complete without him
[1:04:58] but it's not complete without you
[1:05:02] when you talk strange you say things
[1:05:06] that are hard to understand
[1:05:09] well
[1:05:14] it's because you don't listen right
[1:05:22] why can't you believe what you are
[1:05:26] did the prophets say when the bride
[1:05:28] realizes who she is and what she's here
[1:05:32] for
[1:05:37] what do you say that you build an
[1:05:40] invincible army
[1:05:45] Satan won't be able to stand against you
[1:05:48] then you realize where you're at in the
[1:05:51] work
[1:05:54] about it
[1:05:58] recognizing your day in this message
[1:06:03] what part of this are we to be we can
[1:06:07] find all the other ages in the times
[1:06:09] though can we find our own time
[1:06:17] you see as a whole as the Bride of
[1:06:19] Christ
[1:06:20] we are decent of man
[1:06:23] yeah but wait a minute now you met you
[1:06:25] wrote on I wrote it up deliberately we
[1:06:28] are not a son of man the bride of Jesus
[1:06:31] Christ is not a sauna man
[1:06:37] she is his body which is him made
[1:06:41] manifest in another form called the
[1:06:43] bride she is the son of man
[1:06:47] what about trying to explain that in 69
[1:06:56] she see son of man the Word made flesh
[1:07:09] because we sit in and is strong not
[1:07:12] trying to get on his throne not trying
[1:07:15] to be something like that we're just
[1:07:16] taking what we are and saying thank you
[1:07:19] Lord
[1:07:23] brother though that hasn't made you
[1:07:25] exalted - thank you preach back there
[1:07:28] that no it's made me glorify the Lord
[1:07:31] Jesus Christ
[1:07:32] because
[1:07:34] he showed it to me
[1:07:40] didn't that's why I have no problems
[1:07:42] with the seals the Daniel 70 weeks the
[1:07:46] marriage and divorced
[1:07:48] three destinations
[1:07:52] why
[1:07:53] because he's revealed it
[1:07:59] you remember the other day when I said
[1:08:02] that I have no fear I have no fear of
[1:08:04] not being right
[1:08:06] because I'm following a message that was
[1:08:10] vindicated and doing the best I can to
[1:08:12] stay with it yeah but you don't believe
[1:08:14] this don't believe that come let's talk
[1:08:16] you
[1:08:18] know yourself you ain't never faced
[1:08:21] nobody they put together the thoughts
[1:08:23] about the tents and all the return
[1:08:26] ministries and all of that and put it
[1:08:28] together in one way
[1:08:31] to say what brother run said was right
[1:08:37] you believe in return ministry sure do
[1:08:43] what is dead is gonna be raised
[1:08:45] and then we've got a 30 40 day period of
[1:08:49] time
[1:08:52] that we will have a revival
[1:08:56] you're gonna set around the end like you
[1:08:59] do now well I don't know what reaching
[1:09:01] the truth or no I think God I've never
[1:09:04] rode so-and-so said that wouldn't it's
[1:09:06] like I was sitting in a meeting just the
[1:09:08] other day and I got so tickled
[1:09:11] then go tonight with water or what I
[1:09:14] said beside his brother he said here and
[1:09:16] that's why they're they're teaching that
[1:09:17] stuff about not angel coming at the end
[1:09:21] of the age I
[1:09:25] disagree
[1:09:27] cuz of you know what I knew where he got
[1:09:30] that from
[1:09:31] were from here in the tapes but he
[1:09:36] didn't listen
[1:09:37] brother branham is the one that said the
[1:09:40] angel come or the messenger comes to him
[1:09:44] today I didn't say that
[1:09:46] he did
[1:09:48] he didn't offend me didn't I just
[1:09:51] grinned god I'm walking off cuz I
[1:09:53] thought I ain't gonna make no see now
[1:09:55] you're from nobody
[1:09:58] and that's not right
[1:10:03] come on musicians think on these things
[1:10:07] are you sitting in his throne our own
[1:10:10] his strong
[1:10:14] well I got quotes brother brother sit on
[1:10:16] amen and I got a quote where he said
[1:10:19] it's not own it's in so when he says on
[1:10:22] I translate that to N
[1:10:25] what do you do
[1:10:28] cuz we don't you got him in direct
[1:10:30] contradiction
[1:10:32] well if you translate it to n you ain't
[1:10:35] got him in contradiction you got it
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:39] that's what's so amazing to me is this
[1:10:42] message is so beautiful
[1:10:45] but to the people of the message it is
[1:10:48] mass confusion
[1:10:51] because brother Ron will say something
[1:10:53] then you say something you just say this
[1:10:55] and you say that and they'll say well
[1:10:57] which one's right and then a dummy like
[1:11:00] me come along says both of them you just
[1:11:03] ain't listening to what he said
[1:11:09] well we know what he was as a human
[1:11:11] being he made mistakes in his speech
[1:11:14] sometimes he was a human being it taught
[1:11:17] things wrong had to correct it right but
[1:11:20] be real careful how you got him
[1:11:21] correcting
[1:11:24] you might find out he was right
[1:11:27] and yours getting corrected not be the
[1:11:31] pointless Mustang where we got real
[1:11:32] let's sing that course Lord willin wins
[1:11:35] we will try to bring the message to a
[1:11:36] close but until then think about it some
[1:11:40] of my years here
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:52] he is here
[1:11:56] holy
[1:11:57] holy I will bless His name are here and
[1:12:05] we

[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:00] can touch him we're in the act to the
[1:14:03] play
[1:14:08] you remember
[1:14:11] Nance brought a random a question there
[1:14:14] in Revelation 5 he answered it wrong
[1:14:17] he said said that's not the bride

[1:14:58] that Christ is not seen on earth
[1:15:02] that can be seen in heaven
[1:15:05] because that was the question they asked
