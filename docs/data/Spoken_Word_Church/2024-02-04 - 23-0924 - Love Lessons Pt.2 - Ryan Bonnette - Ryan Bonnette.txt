========================================

and I'm also teaching Sunday school today so pray for me all right and uh on my last lesson what I had talked about I started on this kind of a series I guess I'm going to be on this for a while maybe about love just in general about love it's a really broad topic and you could talk about this for for forever I mean but this is my part two of that and this lesson is centered on falling in love so basically I'm teaching a lesson on falling in love and you can infer a lot in in this about marriage and I'm going to be making some comparisons to marriage um because Paul did that too and uh so I'm going to be getting into that aspect of it mostly I'm talking about us falling in love with the Lord so uh as I said last time my statement is this I love to love and I hate to Hate and I if I have a decision to make when I have to choose between the two and I have an interaction with somebody that's not going so well I try to gravitate towards the side of loving them and and having the right kind of reaction to just just have a loving response even if theirs isn't very loving sometimes that we all have those things because you know love is a choice and we choose to love the Lord we choose to to read his word we choose to come to church all those things are a personal choice that we make and I believe this I can't find it in the scripture I don't know exactly how to support it but my own belief about this is that love is depending on free moral agency it's all about choice because if it weren't for that we just be robots if God didn't make us with free moral agency we'd just be robots and just being forced into something so it wouldn't be really love so love has a lot to do with choice so and before I get more into the lesson I want to go ahead and pray and ask the Lord to bless this uh lesson Heavenly Father we thank you for um blessing this Sunday school lesson here and all the others downstairs just give us understanding of your word and let me be a help and encouragement not be an offense to anybody in the things that I say about Bible reading but I believe you laid it on my heart and I just want to go with what you've given me to to teach and I pray just let it be a blessing and and I pray just spark uh that interest in everybody here Lord that's maybe not reading your word every day that we'd begin doing that and be more sincere about it and pray just bless uh the lesson and pray in Jesus name amen so so really fall in love with the Lord first I think uh yeah this is right okay I thought I might have skipped the slide this is Brother brandom here on the message Abraham listen first you've got to be born again of the spirit of God if you're not you'll never understand the word of God God has said so God said I have hid the Bible from the wise and prudent and will reveal it to babes such as we learn if you want to get anything from God just be a baby open up the Bible fall in love with Jesus that's my whole lesson so if you don't hear anything else I say that's the point of the entire lesson open up the Bible fall in love with Jesus I'm talking about falling in love amen and the number one way that I know to do that all these other things enter into it okay when I'm talking about Bible reading I'm also talking about reading the message listening to the message meditating on the word of God praying um you know and fellowship with other believers of course coming to church and listening to the word here but I'm focusing on the concept of daily Bible reading um I've always talked about this I've always talked about seeking first the kingdom of God in almost every lesson and I feel like maybe I can leave that and go to something else maybe I'm maybe people are tired of hearing it until brother Lis I guess you say Lis anhel uman I think how you say it came from Peru and I believe God sent him here to not just to this church but to our country to tell us bunch of Americans start reading the Bible again to listen to the message he said he stood up here over and over again that whole day he was going back and saying look you've got the message you've got the Bible you've got it in so many formats you've got your audio Bible you've got so many versions of the Bible you've got brother Bam's whole entire message in your language and uh you got it in print form you've got it in book form I mean in uh tape form there's really no excuse okay to not read the Bible and listen to message and so forth every single day okay so if I can move out of your way whatever I know look I know he he asked for raise of hands and said who's read the Bible cover to cover and so few people raise their hand but I realized that a lot of people might have been bashful and and just didn't want to brag so there should have been more hands went up probably and then maybe some of you haven't read it cover to cover but you read it on a regular basis that's good you don't necessarily have to read the Bible cover to cover I'm just saying have a regular routine of reading the Bible because I feel like maybe Satan has cast a spell in people's eyes and made them think cuz they're in the message they're okay cuz we're at Spoken Word Church we're okay we don't need to read the Bible and if you look at it like it's an option then you may not do it but I never for since 1999 I started my daily Bible reading in 1999 never once that I get up and say am I going to read the Bible today no it's just automatic I just do it like I breathe air it's just automatic I never give it a second thought you know not once so if you think about it like breathing air I've never missed a day of breathing air since 1984 I've breathed air every day several times a day and I do it sincerely there's no problem with having a routine if you're sincere and I I look at it like breathing air because it's necessary to sustain my natural Life Bible reading is necessary to sustain your spiritual life you need it like you need breath you need it like you need food brother Wade makes the analogy about the baby if you uh have a healthy beautiful baby but you close it up in the closet and don't feed it it'll die another condition of a baby is you could it can be malnourished it can be eating but not quite enough so that's to me a Christian if you just come to church and hear the word being preached but don't go home during the week and meditate on it and read your Bible listen to sermons you're going to be malnourished so you won't grow you won't bear fruit so you'll just kind of sustain life but barely you know so it's such an important thing to read the Bible since the last 23 years of daily Bible reading I can look back at so many things in my life choices made experiences I've had and everything revolves around that daily B reading that's why I'm so adamant about this um it is just so essential so fundamental so and and really really necessary so don't look at it every day like oh I guess I guess I'm not going to do it today Lord I guess I don't have time to be there today Lord I'm a little bit too busy I've got too many other things to do or whatever your excuse is you got to you got to really look at your own life and say what what's getting in my way what's stopping me from reading the Bible every day and if you don't think you need to that's what I'm trying to really address today is is the need for it and make sure you realize it it's a necessity it's not just a good thing to do I was a Baptist when I started reading the Bible every day I was 15 and in the Baptist Church it's it's not really pushed on anybody it's not something anybody feels like they need to do but a lot of us wanted to do it I knew a lot of Baptists that read the Bible I think brother Lis came to the message as a Baptist and a Bible reader as I recall I think I remember him testifying about that brother Dell had already read the Bible when it came in the message a lot of folks in the Baptist Church do it I don't know why it's not so much done in the message and I feel like maybe it might be a misunderstanding of predestination because predestination is taught right from this church but if you misunderstand it and you think that God just handpicked you and he's pushing you through a pipe you're going no matter what maybe you won't read the Bible if you quit looking at like that I look at it like this if you're predestinated you will read the Bible if you're predestinated you will listen to sermons and if you're really born again you really will cuz that was unlikely as a Baptist kid that I would do that since I wasn't even told to do it nobody told me it was necessary even come to church it's just like all we believed in get saved you know pray the sinner's prayer you got your ticket so to speak You're set for life once saved always saved doesn't matter if you come to church doesn't matter if you read the Bible but yet there was a hunger in me that's why I started doing it I wanted to know the Lord I fell in love with him and I wanted to know him and that's why I started my Bible reading amen so if that if you approach God on that basis fall in love open your Bible and just continue to fall in love with the Lord it'll work okay it'll be very effective here's just Paul talking about husband's uh husband head of the wife even Christ is the head of the church husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church he's making comparisons between this love for God and you know love in marriage so by showing you that I'm just saying you know I'm kind of giving myself license to talk back and forth between the two because I don't want you to think I'm trying to belittle agape love and and say it's just like at best you could say I guess fer love is a type of agape love but agape love is so far superior to filo love so and our love for the Lord should be so far superior to our love for spouse and family and so forth so uh Gabby and I've been reading this devotional uh called The Love Dare if you haven't got this you married couples I highly recommend it so i' already skipped quite of my things I was going to say here let's say it's about what was that author oh sorry it's written by uh you look it up probably on Amazon we got it from the library but anyway it's Stephen and Alex Kendrick so you look that up if you are interested in getting that book it's a really good book to read it's a devotional and it's what married couples can do together and this is just one that I picked day 48 be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving each other just as God and in Christ also has forgiven you Ephesians 4 kindness is love and action these are really wordy statements here these really good little nuggets kindness is Love In Action kind of like works is Faith expressed so so you know you have Works uh things like because you believe you do works you know you you uh do things for the Lord because of your faith so uh really works you know faith without works is I mean you if you really have faith you'll do works you like I said you read the Bible you'll you know do other things for the Lord kindness is like that okay kindness is Love In Action if you love in this case I'm talking about the Lord but if you love even your spouse you'll do things out of kindness Grace you know acts of kindness that you display to that person if patience is how love reacts in order to minimize a negative circumstance then kindness is how love acts to maximize as a positive circumstance you really have to think about some of these statements really deep patience avoids a problem kindness creates a blessing one is preventive the other is proactive these two sides of Love Are the cornerstones on which many of the other attributes are built love makes you kind kindness makes you likable when you're kind people want to be around you they see you as being good to them and good for them it also is contagious when someone demonst genuine kindness for you it makes you want to do the same in return but a person who is loving and mature won't always wait to respond in kindness they'd rather be the first to show it are you that kind of person in your home with your spouse what would happen in your marriage if the Ephesians 4 Page mentioned above became your standard operating procedure consider how your vertical relationship with God should directly guide and impact your horizontal horizontal relationship with others so so much of our love for the Lord and our our acts of Love toward him and should kind of you know spill over in other areas of your life with your children with your spouse and so forth so really fall in love with the Lord first let me just pause for one second here because I'm going too fast and as I mentioned a while back um you know a lot of this is about keeping open channels you know I want to keep every facet or every channel open between me and the Lord so he can speak to me that's I'm always adamant about doing that so you know every every day there should be other things involved D you know um other things like you know like I said listening to sermons don't neglect that when I came to the message I didn't put my Bible down and nor do I you know I don't leave one for the other I do I read them both every day okay that's very important okay so Calvary was the ultimate expression of love John 15 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends and last time also talked about the cond Ascension of God brought condescension of his attributes his great faith came all the way down to just believing like a child where we can understand it his great love came down to this form of filal love or we could grasp it we could begin to understand it you know because marriage is so much like a a love lesson that's what this this whole entire series is about love lessons learning to love through marriage and other relationships it's a lot about learning to love including loving our love for the Lord Matthew 18 except you be converted and becomes a little child you shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven so um I've heard it said I'm a truck driver not a business guy but I've heard it said you know best practices you kind of in business you kind of emulate what other people are doing if if it works and you do the same thing they're doing you get the same results so look at I look at brother and sister Dell um I consider them to be successfully married there are my definition of successful marriage because they've been married not just so long but because they're still sweethearts brother and sister Tatum were an example to me um when I was younger sister Janet took some of those young people to their house and I got to see firsthand what real sweethearts are like and so you you look at these married couples who are successful and then you try to do what they're doing and one thing I know that they do in one way or another they put Christ in their marriage it's not supposed to be just husband and wife on a joint venture supposed to be Christ in the marriage and I do that I mean G do that by reading the Bible together but if you even just talk about the Lord together you know that's that accomplishes that to me I believe part of our daily devotion time to the Lord should include meditation on him and on his word that he has revealed to us meditation on his word coupled with prayer and singing praises to Him will cause us to fall more in love with him so somewhere have a place where you meet with the Lord it doesn't have to be you set aside 4 hours a day and you know cuz I know people don't have time for that incorporate into your daily routine whatever you do you know into your drive into you're doing dishes you can always be listening to a sermon meditating on the word of God um while you're doing anything really there's so many mindless chores we do I call them mindless chores because you don't need a lot of concentration to do some of the things we do every day and that you can incorporate this somehow be playing a sermon be singing to the Lord do something you know for the Lord at all all the time and if you're not reading the Bible also I would say this when I was 15 I didn't read five chapters a day I started off reading like one chapter a day but as you do that you begin to fall in love with the Lord and you want to read more and you want to read more and then you gradually want to do more as your love increases but the point is you got to start this somewhere there has to be a time if you're not reading the Bible at all one chapter a day is better than nothing so start there so simple read one chapter a day at least you know this is also an effective method in marriage think about your spouse sometime each day while singing a love songs wedding songs think about when the two of you first fell in love your first date your first meeting in life never lose lose that love you had never leave that sweetheart stage likewise with the Lord never lose your first love for him always remember when he saved you the first time you realized you were forgiven for your sins every time he revealed something to you Etc so real love comes from God real love is like a seed in your heart if it's genuine you plant it in good ground a heart of Faith water at the word and it'll grow stronger also uh I believe too an aspect of love that maybe we don't think about a lot of times is getting to know somebody really intimately getting to know somebody and you fall in love more and in this case mostly I'm talking about our love with the Lord that's why I read his word because I want to know him and in that I'll begin to fall more in love with him and same thing applies to marriage our love for God our love for our spouse should grow stronger every day this is accomplished by cultivating that seed of love you planted when you got married and there I have a picture of the two that couple they're reading the Bible together I know not everybody may be able to do that um for one reason or another but um you know if you can I highly recommend that daily Bible reading together not to replace your individual reading of course because I still read my own I have my own devotional but gab and I read every day together um our Bible and listen to sermons together and read things like I showed you that devotional book uh Spurgeon we like to read a lot of different Christian authors Pilgrims Progress things like that those are all really good but especially read your Bible together at least like I said at least a chapter a day likewise our love for the Lord should grow stronger every day by cultivating the seed of his word sewing it down watering with more word and faith believing it also giving God constant praise prayers fellowship with other believers that stimulates spiritual growth and love for the Lord to increase so selflessness Philippians 2 let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others 1 Corinthians 13 charity suffereth long and His Kind charity envieth not it vth not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things so really again more slides about really falling in love with the Lord this has to be more than affection you know in my early journey I started I had this like feeling of love for the Lord and that's good but it's got to be stronger than that same thing in marriage you know you start off with this little puy love Stage but it's got to go beyond that so it's got to be something stronger and it's got to be more intimate and real and has to be based on something besides just affection you know after realization you are really a sinner Bound for hell but Christ died to save you you will really appreciate him and begin to fall in love with him so after uh let's see that's the same that's a repeat this starts a cycle that continues throughout your entire Christian Journey you love him seek him realize more that what he has done for you and fall more in love with him uh this real love will cause you to seek him more and become more like him grow up the stature of perfect man now this is quote from Brother Wade from just a couple months ago July the Holy Ghost is the most important thing in your life whether you got it or not you've got to know that you know that you know before you can even start with these virtues but listen with the Holy Ghost you can catch up real quick because God said he wouldn't leave anybody behind if you make yourself available that's the key that's what I'm talking about I'll promise you God will give it to you he'll pour it in if you'll just if you just want it bad enough but the Bob from last month how do I know my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life because you're acting it out now whether or not your name was written is turned by your reaction now present tense what's happening right now but to think that God has a place reserved for you because he knew your reaction right now how it would be he knew when it was offered to you if you would respond or not you know uh my statement for a while has been I've been saying this um you don't have to sit and wonder if you're predestinated open the Bible and prove it open the Bible search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life right that's what Jesus said so genuine love will spill over in other areas of your life I said that a while ago parenting and marriage and so forth uh this is Brother ban from Jehovah Gyra number three that's the way it is with God we're not trying to study some newspaper stand standpoint some theological standpoint but fall in love with him get down and really get him in your heart the love of God shed abroad in the Heart by the Holy Ghost then go to reading the Bible and you'll see it coming right out between the lines you see you know what what he's saying he never never said it right out in the word just thank the father because he he had hid those things from eyes of wi and PR wise and prudent so John 14 if you love me keep my Commandments Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee Thy word is a lamp that was Psalm 119 uh this one is Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path God sent um this is what I was saying while ago I just didn't know if I'd get to it so I jumped the gun God sent a minister here from Peru brother Lis uh to remind us to read the Bible and the message that was quite a rebuke and uh you know that God would have to send somebody from another country a third world country where they maybe don't even have all the messages send it here where we do have all the sermons and remind us you need to be reading it you know because he goes a lot of other churches and he got in trouble he used talking about getting in trouble with other ministers and things and I guess about bringing that kind of thing out just kind of making people mad you know but we need to read it brother bam not only spoke English but he spoke our dialect you know he's Southern hillbilly Kentucky English I mean there's no reason and I guess that's really why because Jesus said uh a prophet is not without honor saved among his own country and among his own kin so because he's at our back door up here in Kentucky and because he's just a southerner I guess we tend to say that's just brother brandham no that's a message brother is always saying we've had a message we've had a message and we just need to dig into it perhaps we take for granted the mighty word of God delivered us through such a simple Kentucky man Matthew 13 and they were offended him but Jesus said unto them Prophet is not without honor I just quoted that all right brother Lis hanan's message was simple in essence he was saying God God's promises are on conditions you don't automatically receive them by being in the message this is not automatic okay just because you're here you know I came here from the Baptist Church but I've been studying the message in the Bible I didn't just show up you know we must attach ourselves to the word by reading prayer listening to sermons like our life depends on it because it does daily Bible reading is enormously important to a child of God it's absolutely necessary for spiritual growth like a newborn baby must eat to grow we must eat spiritually to grow and a sufficient amount of spiritual food is necessary uh let's see skip on down this is message Abraham God reveal it to Bab such as will believe if you want anything from God just be a baby open up the Bible and fall in love with Jesus so this is Brother Dell from uh the message brotherly kindness from a series being born again back in this month actually it was about 5 years ago 2018 so when the spiritual children you've got to get to eat the word of God study the word of God you know pray and seek God and ask him to reveal these things to you instead of just saying oh I believe that let it be a part of you and if you have the new birth you will desire it right is that what we read you'll desire the sincere milk of the word we may grow thereby because see that will be a part of your life why wouldn't you want to grow in Christ why would you not would not that to be a desire to to know more about God uh I think of brother Zach black he got born again and almost the next thing I remember him testify about was a dream that he had where he was eating right he was eating a meal and he kept eating eating couldn't get full to me it's obvious the Lord's telling him you're born again a newborn babe now you need to eat and that's what he does I meet him at work all the time he's got that Bluetooth on listening to sermons same same thing I'm doing we're both feeding on the word of God constantly and that's why I started and to church nobody told me I needed to read the Bible I I didn't even think it was necessary I thought it was just a good thing to do but it's not just a good thing to do it's necess it's a necessity really it is for your growth if you're really born again you'll desire it and you'll really want to to get into Christ uh musicians can go ahead and come these are some reasons I'll probably try to get into this more next time why people don't read the Bible these are some things that I think of maybe people have as excuses um I don't have time I've read it before I don't understand it it's too simple to be of value you know we we we make it it's always God in Simplicity God hides and reveals himself in Simplicity Bible reading just seem like such a simple things to do with think I just just my Bible I'll read it tomorrow it'll be there tomorrow I'll read it whenever you or you feel unworthy I was still addicted to pornography when I started reading my Bible that's how I overcame pornography as a 15-year-old kid I didn't even know about sanctification I started reading my Bible every day and pornography and about 6 months left and hasn't been back since 25 about 25 years ago or 24 years ago no relapse I didn't suppress it it's gone uh profanity I was using cuss wordss until about a year after I started reading my Bible it left okay this is you you may feel unworthy start doing it Watch What Happens y don't we don't want to become a routine again I say I breathe out of routine but I'm sincere when I do it we all breathe and eat and everything else we do in life is routine but that's no excuse not to read the Bible just do it and do it with sincerity and that's all I have for today God bless you [Applause]
