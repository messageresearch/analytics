to try to bring this series to a close today but just something about it and I want to make sure you understand what I'm talking about okay so you know we kind of had a little review on it but I want to make sure and then if we have a little bit of time we'll take some questions and answers but you know I just want you to understand what I'm trying to say amen and then you know it's up to the Lord to reveal it so we'll go to Psalms 118 and then we'll go to Second corini 5 2 Corinthians 5 I know you've already prayed but remember brother Tom he's in the hospital they had a little problem with his stomach and you know they're having to run some things on him and all but he should be back is he back in the nursing home yet not yet was was right oh so he's having problems with his stomach and

announcements that I'm failed to make okay father we thank you for the day and the opportunity to be able to come together because as we gather together we realize that with you in our midst and it's a wonderful opportunity to just gather is a great thing because we can fellowship and talk but to realize that great God of Glory yes is come among his people we ask you to just help us and to guide us onto that line Lord that we may see you and father forgive us when we fail you we know that we do and just bless each one remember the one there brother Richard asked us about to to pray uh Lord we forgot the name and all but we you know the one that he wanted us to pray for so you just take cure of everything and we ask you now to guide each one have your way with us lead us in Jesus name amen amen Psalms 118 verse 19 and then we'll go to 2 Corinthians 5 open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord now let's go to Second Corinthians five we'll begin verse 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature a new creation because he's born again see old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation right to it to understand all right now he's given us the ministry of reconciliation to be able to understand right are you reading it to understand to Wi to wh means to understand that God was in Christ reconciling the world and to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and ha committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then what because of all this is presented all right now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ stead be you reconciled to God you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I wish you would uh think on some things and this afternoon we'll pick up a topic or so on something that um I've been thinking on and uh but try to bring this to a close but I I wish you would try to understand one point uh today and that is like what we were reading there the when it says in that verse 20 now then we are ambassadors right all right now uh I know everborn again believer I know how that's taught and what it is and and everything and I'm no ever born again believer you can talk about them being an ambassador for Christ you know because that's true but really an ambassador for Christ that Paul is speaking of that's why it says now then in other words a certain position has been reached you don't send a uh a novice ambassador to a foreign field I remember years ago even when we were in school that one of our ambassadors and that's a long time ago uh what other time I was in school uh the ambassad we sent an ambassador to Russia which would have been back in the 50s and he virtually gave Russia all of our wheat well they had to honor that see whatever that Ambassador uh says he has to be you know you got to honor that see but it's what I'm saying now God don't send uh a a he he didn't use a baby to write the word right he used a real Ambassador now the the baby the child in Christ is an ambassador yeah sure sure that's fine because he's representing God right but he's really not a a true Ambassador until like you see that it coming down to understand that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself see and then it says now then we see I like those uh statements because that's what rings in my brain and I know how crazy you think mine runs all the time anyway but that's all right but see that I look at things like that he says now then after we know about the understanding that God was in Christ how that we come down to to the point of understanding that we have the word of reconciliation the end time message all right says now then we are are ambassadors for Christ in other words you come down to really be a true Ambassador when you come down to the end time and this end time uh you know place at where we are now in in doing that I want you to think about what I've been trying to say and I know this will be a repeat of some that I've tried to do but I I want to make sure you understand that's you know uh it it I can't reveal it to you right but I I want you to understand what I'm talking about you know that's the that's the one thing that I I try to do I know I try to get into detail and and you know and and working on things and I'll get on a subject and I'll just spend service after service after service after service you know repetitive things and all like that uh I know and I'm sorry that's just my makeup because see I know and realize that the human person uh you hear what is they say you retain about 5% of what you hear so in other words we'll be here a little over an hour and you going to get 5% now if you're asleep it's going to cut down the percentage all right so you know that's the the point of doing and and I understand all things you know like that but now what I want to do is just to to just review a little bit and then if you have any questions raise your hand and and we'll try to to comment on it or anything you want to to be brought up I'll try to uh to cover it but you see now don't think that I have covered on this series I've made it plain over and over and over and over that I'm not talking about that just say the new birth is the coming of the Lord right you know I'm not trying to make that point just just like what I'm trying to make the point here it it is a great position to reach of reconciliation and great understandings then Paul says now then we are ambassadors he didn't say we as ambassadors when we first started you know we're ambassadors because why now we can be trusted to be sent somewhere you know and represent the message of the hour see and and and not as just a baby form all right see then to just say you know well the second coming brother Dell I've heard you over and over say the second coming of Jesus Christ is is the bride coming of Jesus Christ coming out of the church well that just means I got my coat and hat and I walked out and I put it in another church now that's not what I'm talking about I don't believe that's what brother Ram was talking about that's right all right he's the one that said it I gave it to you over and over like a 308 seal book I believe that's right but I gave it to you many times to where that he says the second coming of Jesus Christ is the rapture right all right now he said because we meet him in the air he's explaining it and that's what I've tried to do to you to do but see the end time has a wonderful position to be standing in in the coming of Christ all right cuz this is the end time to where truly God has ambassadors that he can send mhm amen by the end time message the five-fold ministry you know carrying the message and trying to lead the people on can come out to a position of of really being a representation of Jesus Christ you know a representation of Christ is one that that uh knows about Christ right um you know God didn't you know who was it Abraham he didn't send a guy you know he said hey come here come here you just now come into our family but we need somebody to go down and find a wife or my son and you go down there well I don't even know what your son looks like I don't even know who he is no he chose a man that understood and when he got through explaining to you know there to the sister she was able to say that's him standing there in the field y because she' Hur so much about him amen and see that's the way I'm talking about it in the end time that uh see it's in the end time we're promised that the the Bride of Jesus Christ is to come up through the statue of a perfect man come out to the position of adoption come out to the placing of Sons and Daughters of God and and being God made manifest on Earth again as the son of man right you know the word made flesh again in a group of people well that's a great position so don't think it's just that I've been saying well the coming of the Lord is just a the new birth cuz I didn't say that now I kept telling it over and over and over that that wasn't what I was saying I said the second coming of Jesus Christ starts in your new birth amen all and then when your new birth is a finished product and you leave this earth in a Rapture right then you can say I'm Bor again see you know that's why Blood of Adam can't be understood by the natural mind because one time he'll be preaching something it looks like he's going that way and then in a little bit it looks like he's going that way all of the same thing you know because he's preaching the word but see then the second coming of Jesus Christ is what it started on the day of Pentecost in the hearts of the Saints just as we covered how the that in the Old Testament that the coming of Jesus Christ the first time took 4,000 years and all of those prophets bringing that and they were actually bringing the word of the hour that they were there and you know what you remember how we were trying to bring it out blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord see they were actually to the people those prophets were God to the people they were not the god of Glory no but they were God to the people in the bases that God had entrusted them to bring the word that was God's presence was through those prophets right and they would write the word and then Jesus would step out there being the very one that would be the the the very word himself and see that was his first coming well why can't we see then that here in the end time see look back down through and see what's T has taken place and see that down through the church ages has been the coming of the Lord right but there's a lot in this in time to be dealing with the coming of the Lord we've got to walk off this Earth in the Rapture to talk about the second coming of Jesus Christ and I want to make sure you didn't misunderstand me on that to just think well you know oh it's just a simple matter no it's not a simple matter right you and I are here we've got to become the word amen amen made flesh for the portion that we are now we're not all the bride that's see it's around the world but see everybody then that's got their part has to have their part right that's why it's took so long see 40 something years for God to be able to get the message around and and to the people you you know to where that they could see it and see then in that then it's been what been the the coming of the Lord see when God sends you like when that's the reason we read the Ambassador he said then we are now we are ambassadors now see all right he sent you to replace him right now the Catholic Church believes that you're instead of God right that's what they believe the pope is but now that's not how we believe it that's right we believe that we're in God's stad cuz that's what scripture I got in here in a while I read it said you know I beseech you in God's stead not instead of God because being instead of God would mean that you was greater than he but if you're in God's stead if you're an ambassador then God is in you cuz see those prophets as they would go out and preach their message message like the psalmist like I said they'd say you know they pierc my hands and my feet it just like he was actually going through a great turmoil in his life and you know if you'd have been standing there looking at him you'd have probably seen tears in his eyes and and the body wretching like with pain and he would be screaming out you know they pierced my hands and my feet cuz it was so real cuz that was the Lord using that person and see blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord then right you remember how he was explaining it I send brother Danny in my place that's fine as long as the people knows that I send him I give him the authority I make him an ambassador that he can go represent me well that's the same as me being there that's right but see that is even carnal because that is even not the way God is but God is God is really there amen he was there in them prophets amen amen all right he was D down to the church ages the seven spirits of God you know the eyes running to and fro in all the Book of Revelation right you know you think maybe that I took a lot of time trying to explain that lot about it but my Lord we've been 6 months on the golden candlesticks and things if we just stopped broke it down you know the way the Bible covers it and the things but see I was wanting you to see that that was God the bride right coming out of the church right that's what's been happening down through the the ages right the bride has been coming out of the church see the prophet said it's a church out of a church cuz a church means a called out you know but now do you understand what I'm saying then see that is not to just make a statement well the second coming well that's Second Coming is a new birth oh we understand that you know no that's not what I said that was not not what I was teaching but the second coming to you begin in the New Birth that you receive amen are you expecting something else to be his second coming what is it going to be right I'm serious I want to know see what you mean cuz I I mean I'm involved in this thing you I I want to know if you have some other way of us getting out of here other than than just grinding in the word and God revealing his word to us and as he's revealing his word then to me that's the person of God being revealed to you amen that's why you're a new creature right you're a new creation right but that doesn't that doesn't solve everything that's just a new birth when you started right but see then coming up through the statue of perect man on out through those things I believe that's what Paul was trying to tell the Corinthians now we are ambassadors you've been in the journey a long time now you're you're an ambassador see amen see when those prophets wrote the Bible that was a same as God writing it amen they didn't have their own thoughts that's right like brother R explaining you know that that we're there that Isaiah would a set of Virgin shall conceive said probably went home and said my Lord what kind of a goof up did I make yeah how's a virgin going to conceive you know read something the other day about this and I'm not saying anything wrong now I'm just saying they they're studying this uh artificial insemination every how you use those big old words I don't understand it but where they putting that together and coming out with these things and babies and all and thank God for them but they're also so seeing now that they're turning out to be bigger babies if you've been reading that they say there there actually would be bigger babies from most of those things cuz it's not natural right it's not the natural way right of it being done see but now I'm not against that I'm saying thank God for it cuz there's a lot of B you know a lot of people have little babies but I'm just saying that's it's not the way that was intended to be and see then it it it brings other things all right but now listen the prophets as I said they didn't use their own thoughts their words were not their words that's right that's right it was God using their lips right right right now but what about in the New Testament Prophet you remember said you've been given more gifts than all of them remember that's what it said about brother R right cuz see he was a new testament prophet he was a born again believer the Old Testament Prophet was come out and speak his word and then he would go back see he was Moses you know but then he was God and he was Moses right but now brother brandom not meaning that everything brother Bram done no not we're not foolish but see the Holy Ghost was inside of him in the new birth right then surely we can see that Moses was God unto the people yes and if anybody thinks like I don't keep up with a lot of things and check it out but if you'll check in Exodus 4:16 it says that that Moses was instead of God right you'll be instead but I'll challenge you on something else every other definition of instead in the Bible has a strong Concord definition that does not have one because they didn't know what to put there they just put the word instead understand that understand they didn't understand what was being said I'm just giving you that as a thought CU see I try to check everything out uh but now watch good God wanted the people to understand that he was with them that's what I've been trying to get us to see see not looking for him to come from somewhere but to look at him being here right see Moses said he's not over the sea he's not up in heaven Paul picks it up he's not thee right he's in You by the new birth now he was very n to them but now he's in Us by the new bird see but God wanted the people to see look at Abraham meeting MDC and actually feeding a meal to God himself the very God of Glory was standing there upon earth right see it's never been that God wants us to see there's a God somewhere else he wants us to understand that God is with us that's right that has been the whole thing that's what I've tried my best for 40 years now to preach that God's not up in heaven right a God in heaven forgive me Lord is no good to us amen I kind of like what brother said about it and I like it my way of saying a god Heaven Ain't no good god with me or in me is good now remember the man that that said you know uh I I want to god with skin on it you remember the little kid or something we see I want to know and realize God is in these skins that's what I'm trying to preach unto us all right but see mdic actually came down God himself came down and sat down there and ate a c you see God wanted the children of Israel to see it right Moses tried his best to get the people to to see the God that he that he had met that's what he wanted to do he wanted them to meet at the burning bush he gave them all the bush he wanted them to see it but what did they do no no we don't want to do that we said now what we want to do Moses we want you to go up there and you get What God Says and you come back down and you tell us and we'll believe you right now there was God killed them right there cuz they stand there lying through their teeth that's right right they were dying through their teeth cuz they didn't believe it go over and read I just looking at one the other day while I studying on some of this go over to numbers 16 sometimes and read that whole chapter that's where you'll find uh Dayan and Kora and abam you know and what happened to them because Dayan and them said you know Moses you you take too much upon yourself right we're spiritual too now they were the people that had said in chapters previous to that you go get What God Says and we will believe you right now where did they lose that at right they got where that they were so spiritual until they got to where that they believed see if you'll notice in there Moses said are you trying to even now to take the priesthood see they were in a priest line but they were not the priesthood right to be able to where they could go behind a veil in a different thing but see that's what they wanted and they actually said Moses you're too you think you got too much we're spiritual too that's right the whole congregation is spiritual he said I'll tell you what you do he said we'll just find out what's going on he said you get all of them together tomorrow and said it was 250 priest their ministers there did you get them together and said we'll just find out soam and Kora and you know daan they there and what was so odd to me has always been to me so sad when they stood out there their wives stood with them and their children right stood with them and what happened Moses said if what I'm telling you is the truth we're going to see something that's not even never been done before said if it if they're wrong said the Earth will open and swallow them up cuz they wouldn't even come up read it two times in there in numbers they wouldn't even come up when Moses called them you know why cuz they were scared of him that's right right they were scared they were scared cuz they said you brought us out here to kill us and if you'll notice they said we left a land of milk and honey another word Egypt with the garlics and the cucumbers and they called it the land of milk and honey and said you said you've taken us to a land of milk and honey read numbers is in there but see they wouldn't come up Moses fin told come on mhm see they were afraid that Moses was going to physically kill them that's right right you know they figured he had enough back up that he could be able to get them all together he's going to kill them they didn't want to come up there they was pretty smart but see he finally said come on home that's right but God opened up the Earth amen and swallowed them up 250 preachers standing with the sensors in their hand or what they call those things and Fire right off the altar of the same place that Aaron had his that's right ER swallowed him up you know what was so great about God he said gather up All Those sensors cuz they're holy and he says we'll make other things out of them but you understand what I'm getting at they said we will believe you Moses we don't want God to speak but they didn't believe Moses see because they didn't have a personal experience with the god that Moses had an experience with right they had an opportunity to but they they didn't have an experience do we have an experience amen see I'm asking you a question this is the coming of the Lord part 18 this is the question has he come to you come on through the opening of the word has God come to you I believe that yes sir Israel would believe that God was in Moses and with his mouth cuz they could see that but then when it would come down to the final line oh no no no we we really don't know go we're all spiritual daythan and cor and and baron was pretty good preachers they convinced the people that they were spiritual too and they were spiritual that's what Moses wanted them to be right what listen which one said I would that all were prophets was Moses that said that we did all the children of were prophets cuz he wanted them to do it but now show you how far off the human being can be what about the Earth opening up what about the proving of who was who how about all of the things of Moses standing there 250 preachers and all of abam and Kora and their families and everything goes down in a hole you know what happened the next day read it verse 4 41 of the 16th chapter of numbers they come before Moses and they said Moses you've killed the people of God God came down and smote him with a plague what did he say I forgot I think 16,000 or something somewhere up into the thousands of them died in the plague well you know what happened to show you Moses was still right where he was he said Aaron grab your s and run among the people pre Adventure we can make an atonement still trying to save the people and them doing everything they doing and accusing him of all of that but 16,000 or something like that so many thousand of them died why cuz they'd never seen the god Moses saw right that's what I'm asking you through the opening of the word that the end time Prophet has brought unto us can you see that God is here right can you see that God is real right amen that he's not just a thought or ative of your imagination now come on be human beings and think sensible when you first heard of this message you didn't know God was real that's right oh yes God is real I talked to him this morning yeah yeah but did you know how real God was when you first heard of it no that's right I believe we're just now beginning to realize the reality of God that's right amen and it's true the opening of the word that's it right there it can't be anything else it's true the opening of the word but see you say some of you have said this way you say brother Dale has the word of the Lord but why then do you side with the Enemy sometime amen what do you mean because you side with the Enemy wouldn't that what Samson said about the guys there you know that if you hadn't have been plowed with my wife you wouldn't have found out these things you remember in the Samson and how that they learned the secrets right and then he had to go out and kill a bunch of people to bring back a a prize for that he said you've been playing with my heers reason you know if we believe that God is here by the revealed word that does not make anything out of the person right right right right brother random was what the prophet of God right wonderful but he was not God right you can say well he's God unto me I know what you're talking about yeah that's all right I just I say it too because he was he brought the word to us right all right but he wasn't God right God was using the man right we're not giving the glory to the man we're giving the glory to God we see if God has given us a word Lula thank God for giving us the word thank God for that that's all that I've ever said right all right cuz see we're talking about blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord right if God has sent us with the word then why don't we believe that God has come in us with the word I said to us now I'm not talking about me I'm not trying to build up anything I'm trying to I've always tried to get you to see that there's a God in you amen what God deal with me I don't tell you a lot because you'll get buil upon that to where that you'll think well now you know brother D brother brother it ain't brother Dale it's God Amen thank God for who the word comes to yeah thank God but that that won't take us out of this world for you to believe that there's a god in me right you got to have God in you that's what I tried to encourage you to do see surely we can see that when Jesus Christ came into the world sure he was a prophet he was fulfilling the office of a prophet but he was more than that wouldn't he he was God made manifest well why can't we believe that in the end time by the new birth right the scripture says he made us a new creature creation why can't we believe then that the coming of the Lord is a revealing of the word to you and I right what would be the trouble of believ in that there's plenty things to take place in the revealing of the word right sure there's a lot of things that hasn't transpired like I said the other day where we're not under a religious persecution and I've always SE the prophet the way he said it right that they going to come after us for we believe right but nobody's come after us there's a lot of things left come on but it can take place in a hurry amen see the new birth making you a new creation right that's what I've been trying to preach then that would be the coming of the Lord to you right amen because he's not coming as a uh group or you know I know I know it's the body but still a body has many different kind of Parts but in the Gentiles it's not coming like he did to Israel to where did he come down and and literally stood there and said unless you believe that I am he you die in your sins This Not That way to the Gentiles the coming of the Lord is the revealing of the word amen all right that's why some of us will have to die and go by the grave why because the the word has not been revealed to us right but you see it least if we've got the word planted in the field come on Amen then God can Quicken that word that's all I've ever tried to do for you you know for you and I both cuz you see I want it too you know but now listen see we're not like the Old Testament in the bases that we have the new birth amen we have actually the presence of God living within us by the new birth whereas the old test people only had him with them right and an anointing that could come up on them that's right cuz they didn't have the new birth back there that's right see but down through the church ages it's been God revealing himself through a group of people right the Believers what did Christ Ministry God reveal the Believers in the book come on amen that's it you realize that that there's not much written now listen to me a minute there's not much written about the church oh yeah you said no no no there's not much written about the church right I'm talking about down to the ages no right it started out in the book of Acts that was written Paul Peter James John all of them writing yes but then all at once you've got a vast gap between there and the coming of Elijah in the end time right that's what you're ET said he say not much said about the church down to the why because it would be a mystery that would be waiting for the end time where the Prophet would pick it up and explain the seven golden candlesticks but you realize that Martin Luther would the just shall live by faith is just as much Bible as Moses saying I'm going to Egypt and take over that's that's where we don't see it like that that's right we're not going to have to raise Martin Luther up and preach to him a sermon to bring him to a Perfection right he went down in his Perfection and will raise one morning and the prophet said wake up just like just like he'd been asleep you know just up there he is boy that was a good NA am not realizing at 5 600 years but are you fing what I'm saying God came down to dwell with man and no longer and never will he be self-existing again right he chose it that way right he chose it to be that way he chose it to be to work in that he could come down and be literally here with us right he said well God's up in heaven today well where do you get that at I mean show it to them in the Bible well God is millions of millions of light years out there up into the space you know where do you get that at am as I said to you what good is a god out there right right I don't want to get him to get hooked up in The Ether ways or what you call all those things and him be off on a journey and me need him come on you know cuz if your heart right now takes a big blast and blows out who was it the other day that was Allan they said he probably never even felt it it would just sit your great well now wouldn't it be something for Adam to lay there and it feels pain he do The Ether waves come down lord no you you said oh brother tell you don't understand I agree with you I don't understand I don't understand why you understand the way you understand amen because I've never look for the coming of the Lord to be somewhere else come on when I saw this message I saw what this message is this message is the coming of the Lord believe amen that's right that's why I cherish the prophet's message that's right it is the coming of the Lord to me and I'm not going to find it in the G domac right right amen McDonald domc in Jamaica either one see this is a love letter this is to me this is my Bible right right this is my God speaking to me right why can't we believe that am that's right why are we looking for something else the prophet never told you about a god somewhere else that's he talked about God being real see how would it be that that we could ever think about God not being real and then the prophet would say things like that we've used in the last few messages are like one time where he says you know the final under her messenger she'll be the final voice to the final age right thousands of live voices preaching the word of God Amen see the whole bride of Christ around the world taking the message to the lost that's right and that's his final voice that's his presence right cuz wherever the voice and the person is that's his presence that's right but see then the last one we were on are the other day see brother random on page 76 or you page 76 Christ Myst of God reveal he said making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message oh right you say but brother Randon brought the message preach right amen but brother R's not the final voice to the final Aid that's right he brought his message he delivered the message thank God now you and I are to become that message that always tell you about the walls of Jericho Joshua was up on the hill watching them cuz he done told him what to do when they got down there and done what he told them to do then they stopped and looked at the wall and they didn't holler scream you know what do you think it was some kind of a r loud racket that vibrated now the ground opened up and swallowed the walls they didn't vibrate down you got Common Sense you'd think about it that you'd have to be 50 ft away from the wall if they vibrated and fell down or it fall on you that's right brother but the Earth just opened up what at the word of the people when the people became what the man had said that's all I've ever tried my best to get you and I to see when we become what brother random has says we are and he only said what God said we are right what's the difference in the person and the voice right Book of Revelation he turned to see the voice the voice in the person brother R said is the same but the bride see is to bring the voice in the final age right what is that voice you can't add one thing to brother R's message now so don't worry about that right that's what they've done and that's what they've done with Barum and cor and all of them you know they got so spiritual and that's way the people of the message is done they've got so spiritual until when brother bran was here like I said about Moses and them it wouldn't come up when Moses said come up they wouldn't come up you know why they scared to death that's right Moses going to whoop them all yes and they probably would by the time he got up there but they were scared see the people of this message would have scared of brother random when he was here right boy they wouldn't dare tackle him while he's here but immediately leaving the scene that's right here comes all of these great things the prophet told me something secret I remember this brother he used to preach and he had everybody because everybody would talking to me about it and he'd say brother brandom not only told me to preach of course he had a little problem in his marital and brother randam did tell the people to leave him alone now I know that so forget it but he said God brother R not only told me to preach he told me what to preach well everybody what did he tell him to preach then they got all them doctrines going around the country that there was seven Thunders with seven preachers and they named him as one of the the preachers That was supposed to be one of the Thunders now you know of some of the others that said I can't preach era and I challenged him right here before he come to this church one night on it and he did preach era here and talked it down at the school building and I told him he was wrong not being nasty being sarcastic just being truthful but you see they wouldn't D face brother Brandon while he was here but as quick as he was gone they started saying he told me these things well you know what I'm just kind of a guy you know I'm not I'm not a nosy person my wife will tell you that in a hurry I'm not a nosy person if you ever been around I'm not what goes on I don't knows around there's a lot of people knows a whole lot more about what's in this church than I know about it that's right cuz I don't go around listen to every little tattletail and I'm not on the phone calling you up and wanting to know all the tattletales no I just don't care nothing about it right but when I want to know something I'll find it out right I've got a little gift of being stubborn I guess it is but I can find out something if I want to know something from brother Donnie I don't have to walk up to him and say Donnie I want to know so and so I'll just pick him to death about it for a while and get what I want to know cuz he going to tell me I wow if he's not the gift ain't working see but see this brother he kept saying God told the prophet told me to preach and told me what to preach so one day I just cornered him about and I said brother why did Brother R tell you to preach you he said he told me to preach Hell Fire and it hot okay that's whatever preacher is supposed to preach but yet everybody thinking it was some great Supernatural Revelation it was Hellfire and it hot you know so I just walk off grinning you know but listen folks Why Can't We Believe here in the end time that this bride of Jesus Christ is the very God made manifest in another form called a bride amen right L you said well I I'm just brother Dale I'm just s God didn't ask you what you are I'll get to it this evening brother R said when I married my wife he said she cooks and does things something to that degree he said because that's her part of the obligation of doing he said but I'm married to her she never does it right your looking around at T see I mean in that contract you know the marriage vows it doesn't say if you quit cooking you can divorce itn't doesn't say that but now listen the bride is to be the final voice right under her me messenger we don't have we don't added anything to it come and show me where I've added anything to this message that's that's right I challenge you on internet or anywhere or anybody that's ever been around me come show me where I've ever added anything or took away from what the prophet of God has said well I'm open for it where you at of course you'll go tell everybody else I did but remember that will be answered to one of these days because that's your business you go tell everybody else where the problem is but won't tell me no but listen what then do we talk about that would be the message that would cover the entire Bible that the bride would be bringing the message in the end time that's right we preached for 2,000 years on he has risen but don't you think about it's about time to say he's hereen yeah I mean is any problem with that is that a great Supernatural Brother D I thought this you was going to tell us they you going to preach this you no no we're going to preach what he is here right that's all I've ever tried to tell you about the second coming of Jesus Christ now if those around the world or people out there can't see that he is here then where are they at right with the bride she knows right where he's at amen cuz she knows that scripture is talking about her right like I've always told you go to the Book of Revelation and show me Jesus every byself come on folks that's why the devil don't want you in the Book of Revelations show me Jesus in The Book of Revelation by itself like I said the other day you said well that well that that lamb that took the book you better go back and read your prophet's message cuz where did that lamb come from he said it come from the church ages that's right cuz it's got seven horns and seven eyes it come from the church ages what produces the lamb to take the book what made it to where brother random could come forth and preach the word right the promise of God that would show us I've told you what I believe I believe the coming of the Lord is revealing of his word right I believe that those seals that the prophet was to preach that nobody didn't get to preach down there Jesus preached them in Matthew uh 24 come on he preached and learn the word right but brother around can't add to it but you say well now there wouldn't no seventh one in there there's only six no because there Jesus was why did he have to preach anything else he was standing there when he says I am the I am surely that's enough fulfillment of what it said back there before Abraham was I am is that enough of the I am to know that the I am that's standing in front of the Burning Bush was the you know the was the same one was listening last night of a message mage of Grace were the prophet I'd invite you to listen to that message in 61 I it's 8:27 61 the message of Grace and he was talking about those rainbows coming down three of them coming down you remember and said the Jesus of the New Testament is a Jehovah the old he said only change his mask right y he said just change his mask and come in flesh well now where is that Pillar of Fire today still Fallen the bride of Christ it's been seen right here two or three times and people won't even say nothing about it cuz you see you don't see it if you don't see it you ain't going to say nobody see it but that's all right see that's where I preach I don't have to have it God knows that I don't have to have that backup to prove I'm proving what I say by this word you come and argue on this word we'll be glad to say sit down here and talk on this word not argue with you talk on the word because that's what I believe so I believe the headstone to the church is a revealing of those Seven Seals to the bride of Christ that's right which is a revealing of his word y then what would be the message after the head and body unites that the bride will bring that he's here y do you see that he's here how simple is it I'm accused of being so intellectual that's what people said brother used to intellect we can't understand you you know why that you can't understand me cuz the way I talk you got to have the Holy Ghost to understand that's right that's just the best way to say it to you that's why people don't understand it don't have the Holy Ghost that's right you got to think about what I said I want you to think about what I'm saying I want you to think about it in the middle of the night I want you to pray about it Lord what is that man talking about then he'll come down and talk to you cuz that's what I want if I give you all the answers Gary what's the problem you don't need to study none do you but see this is personal this is personal but for God to say what was Zechariah said that the headstone would be coming calling what Grace Grace now what is any greater message of Grace Grace to say he's here what could be greater than do you to think about not a god up in heaven but a God that's in you making itself manifest come on brother think on these things I just I just don't want it to be that people will misunderstand me and and you know accuse me saying something that that's your problem that's your business but to misunderstand me the coming of the Lord is revealing of his word amen cuz he's not coming in a Corporal let's stand together not coming in a Corporal physical body in the end time we meet him in the a right all right that's so simple but for him to be able to just speak through us and say Well done thy good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the Lord he's going to be present to say those things what's the difference now we're talking about God we're not talking about I tried to explain it you know if I gave Danny my word to go take to somebody that's fine if they know all about it and everything but it's so much greater in God cuz what's the difference in him and his word well brother Dale I just love to see God right there in this Bible That's where he's at no I want to see him well you're just like Moses Moses wanted to see a physical that's human that's that's all right he wanted to see something more real than he'd seen and that's fine but you see if you ain't careful you get into the devil's trap because he can send angels to you and you'll see things just leave it alone and let him come to you and then you'll realize reality yes and see what's right what we got brother 299 299 anybody has a need I'm just saying the Lord is hereu he is here he holy holy I will his name again he is here your name he is here you can touch him you the just s pray and believe that way we can commit it to him I love it that way father we commit this to you Lord we send it fir Claus to be what our sister has need of and that your you'll come down and you'll speak speak to your brother there Lord just help help his wife help them and just let him be one in you and to love one another and to see all his way would you have power in Jesus name anybody else he is here oh his name anybody else what do you think would encourage God most of all I mean is there anything you can do to to get on the good side of God I only know one thing that you can do to be on the good side of God and that's to believe God's word cuz I tried to get you to see that the children of Israel Sinn 10 times before they come to kades barnea but he was still ready to take them over he didn't mention it he dealt with each individual case and 10 times it' sinned but when they didn't believe that he was capable of taking them into the promised land that's see they were doubting his word he says to the Wilderness you go until you come back to where that you can believe see that's what's happened to us folks is when the prophet left the scene a lot wouldn't there and all that but that's part of the journey and part of the things but see he wants us to realize that he's here that's right you know I mean just just to realize that he's here yes you traveling is one thing Journey coming is another thing I've Tri to explain it you're all somewhere and you're on your way home you know and you call and you tell them on the phone you know we've landed at the airport we're here in Atlanta I don't mean you home that's right we went out to Arizona one time and we traveled thousands of miles I forgot how many thousands of miles never got in one traffic town all up from Grand Canyon back down to Tucson and back up to Phoenix and all over the pl never one traffic jam we landed in Atlanta we pulled out of the airport right was right there in front of us sat there for the longest I said ain't this something Travel halfway around the world and not a traffic jam but you see a god out there is nothing good like that it's when you realize you're at home you know you start driving down that road and you start getting close closer you know you start seeing all the familiar things amen and you realize I'm getting home that's right but you know that's what God wants us to do to realize he's here realize he's real that's right and he's with us he's not all somewhere else amen he's with us that I'll never leave you nor forsake you that's right why can't we believe him amen that's right Lord Jesus we could spend the rest of the afternoon trying to talk about you and your presence and what you've been so many times to us in our walk but yet Lord that wouldn't be nothing but encouragement to other people it's when they can realize the walk that they've had and the times that they've been and the times you've ped on the scene to them Lord and you've worked out all kind of problems and you straightened out all situations because you're real you've always wanted us to realize that you were here Lord what else would be a message to finish this thing up with but to say he is here not even to just say he's risen that's fine but to say he's here he's here with us thank you Father we love you we just commit everything to you as we go eat a natural me bring us back together this evening in your love and all out there on the internet systems that hear the message I pray father that they won't just hear one sermon here and the sermon there and not realize what we're talking about that we're talking about your coming that begins right there in our new birth that's when you started coming to us and when that is finished in The Headstone and the Rapture and we leave out of here there is your coming Lord we love you we thank you have your way send your ambassadors to speak your word let your light shine in Jesus name you dismiss remember the service this afternoon sir okay all right hold on hold on just a minute brother want to D Hallelujah and these three people drove all the way down there and looked him up and found him amen they said

asked me there the other day when I went to see him Friday said uh what do you think's going on you know I said well what if there somebody down here if you talk to right I said maybe that's what's going on you know so maybe that's what's going on his sons have said if he walks out of there they're going to be in church with him every time he's in church so I'm claiming that that's we'll just challenge him on do you dismissed Hall we
