the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen amen amen praise the Lord so before we sit let's read the scripture in Revelation chapter 5 amen praise the Lord we're going to read in the three books Revelation Peter and Hebrew praise God it start in chapter 5: 8 to 10 and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden bals full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth amen verse 1 Peter 2:9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light for he testifieth you are the priest Forever After the order of MEC may the Lord add the blessing from the reading of his scripture you all may be seated praise God so we always thank the Lord for this privilege amen praise God to read and to listen and to praise and worship him praise God hallelujah so maybe next time I will also play the [Laughter] saop yeah I love music that's why I said U by heart I I am a musicians and I'm business is minded and nothing in my body that is of god you know that is God you know thinking about God praise God but with his Mercy praise God he call us and uh he allow us he trust us to work in his field that's why I always this has just a um great privilege uh it's an honor for me and uh praise God see that God really trust us this much you know see Hallelujah so I want to speak about like what the Bible said um see he sang a new song He redeemed Us in verse 10 he said he has made us King and Priests see God did not just redeem us for nothing so he has a purpose remember that praise God he he he's not just about us and then put us in one place and we're not not doing anything okay he has a plan for us okay and the Bible says he has made us so like the prophet always said it is in past tence see praise God that's why he said that if you hear somebody said that Jesus uh praise God Jesus is um heal uh God's healing he said no that's a lie because he had already healed you see it's past then praise God he done that 2,000 years ago at the cross of Calvary praise God so same thing he had made us Kings and Priests see the Bible never said that he is going to make us King and priest praise God but he's already in past tense praise God that's why I to today I just want to speak about the you know the heart of the believer praise God see I give this a title of uh in the order of MC praise the Lord see Hallelujah remember this it says here he had made us verse 10 he had made us Kings and Priests praise God one time I share about the chosen generation see there is one generation that is missing praise God say because after Jesus Christ there need to be one generation because the Bible said we need a 14th generation from coming out of Babylon to Jesus Christ amen see and we saw that praise God the last name is Lord Jesus Christ and there is no name higher than name Jesus Christ see so this 14th generation that is coming praise God hallelujah and Peter saw it it was a chosen generation they cannot name it like I like I Shar it before nobody can name her see the apostles just said they are a chosen generation they are the elect they are without spot without drinkers without blemish but they cannot put the name praise God see only in our age the 14th name appear praise God and what is the name higher than the name Lord Jesus Christ nothing that's why the prophet always keep on saying he he swear in his own name right because there is no name higher than that name praise God see the 14th name must be equally praise God equal with the 13 13th name see and the 13th name is Jesus Christ see no name can be higher than that name praise God that's why the 14th name is also Jesus Christ amen and M Jesus Christ okay so we have that chosen generation then it says we are in the lineage of a royal priesthood praise God so remember this we have something to do we have praise God see Hallelujah see now in the beginning when man fall in sin God is a holy God see in that condition if God will allow his children to face him they will die praise God and and the father love his children so he's trying to make a way praise God see for them not to die see so what he did so every time his children trying to approach him there are two sherim to sherim that will close the throne see they will spread their wings one that way one this way to cover the face of the father see in that condition they will die praise God see so now there is in between the wings of that cherubim become the mercy of the father see praise God there is in between them Hallelujah see the children the son speak the father answered them the father speak the son ask question and so on but they they cannot see the face of God anymore for he is Holy okay so that Wing serve us the mercy of God praise God see Hallelujah until the time of Moses when God wants to speak to his children God always want to speak to his children but with that condition they will die praise God hallelujah see now so he he said to Moses gather my people I want to speak to them I want to speak to them God always want to speak to his people see praise God but then he said to Moses bring them to to Horeb bring them to Mount Si and put tie put a robe around that mountain in that way nobody can approach that mountain even the animal if anybody cross that line cross that rope Stone it to death Spear and thrust it to death see praise God that is the Commandment that is the word of the Lord for God is Holy praise God see Hallelujah so Moses tie a rope around that mountain no then that throat become a boundary praise God see any any animal that will cross that is that maybe a thin rope maybe an inch stick but anybody that will cross that Trope it will be stoned to death see or they will spirit until it die see but as long as they are behind that Rob that robe yeah serve us the mercy of God see it become the mercy of God even even how thin the Rope is it it is the mercy of God see once you cross that rope you're fish see that Rob serve as the mercy of God hallelujah see now now here's Moses remember he had made us Kings and Priests praise God so Moses praise God he's he he's just a simple man right there's nothing in Moses praise God see but God loves Moses so he asked Moses to take his people to that mountain so he can speak to them see then Moses tied the Rope then God gave his commandment and people hear the voice of God praise God see then Mo then God asked Moses to come up he said I want to talk to you then Aaron and several Elders came with Moses but then God said to Moses just leave them leave them in the middle only you can come up so Moses went and talked to the father while he was on that mountain his Brethren see they were impatience right for 40 days only 40 days maybe only in 30 days they were so impatient right see they make this golden C then while on the mountain after 40 days God said to Moses Moses you go down go down as quick as possible then Moses said oh Lord yes they have some sort of Revival down there oh yes I'm going to kill them all he said I'm going to kill them all but don't worry Moses I'm I'm going to start with you again why Lord imagine just 40 days they have forgotten all the things that I did to them I open the Red Sea and they cross the Red Sea they complain I did nothing they want to drink the water after they cross the sea they complain again I did nothing then they got hungry i r Mana Out of Heaven I pour Mana Out of Heaven I feed them see but this is what they did to me they make an idol and gave that glory to that Idol and Moses these are stiff naked people yeah but don't worry I will kill them all but I will start with you I'm going to start with you I will make you a popular I will make you a strong Nation I'll be with you don't worry you know what Moses did he said Lord we've been in Egypt 400 years Lord 10 generation some of us forget forgot who is God some of some of us already worship with the idol you know this Egyptian teach us how to worship this Idol what do you expect from us what do you expect from your people we've been in Egypt for 400 years now here we are Lord can you just forgive them Lord can you forgive my brother can you forgive my sister said no no I will just kill them I will wipe them out they are stiff naked people Moses Lord okay you can do that Lord but kill me too kill me Lord if you want to kill them all just kill me and do what you want to do see then you know what God did Moses okay Moses hallu because of you because of you I will not kill them because of you Moses you know Moses Moses become the mercy of God he become the mercy of God Hallelujah God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked I hope you have that in your heart hallelujah praise God that who can say Lord have mercy on my brother right have mercy on my sister God is looking for a priest God is not looking for a judge see hallelujah amen hallelujah see look so Moses serve as the mercy of God see even how weak Mo Moses is he's the mercy of God you see that rope even how thin that rope is that is the mercy of God as long as you are behind that rope even how thin it is that is the mercy of God see but you know Moses is also human see people are keep on complaining people are keep on complaining praise God hallelujah see but do you remember that Ark of the Covenant see you know God put that Ark of the Covenant and then he cover it with that piece of wood then he put the sherub him right praise God see because in the Garden of Eden the cherubim serve as the mercy of God then he put another wood on top of that mercy seat and inside there is the tablets we know the three things in there the golden jar with the golden with the hidden Mana then we have the rod of Aon then we have that golden tablets the two tablets of the Ten Commandments see you know the power of the art they know the power of the art praise God see do you know how powerful the ark is one day when they are trying to conquer the Jericho the wall of Jericho they did nothing they just carry the ark and they move around and that wall of Jericho fall down when they cross that River Jordan they did nothing see they just put the Ark on their shoulder when that priest touched the water the power of the Ark when when through them from the shoulder going down to their feet and that dried up the River Jordan so they know the power of the Ark see then one day you know they they go against God and the son of Eli panas you know and Hof they took the art and take it to the battlefield remember that praise God and the Philistine were so scared he said now the god of Israel is with them the god of Israel is with them but then some of them said don't worry maybe the God of Israel he is powerful on the mountain but we are going we're going against them on the plane see so when they carry the ark into the battlefield everybody's rejoicing but we know what happened God is using the Philistine to chastise them and the Philistine caught the ark see when that AR was caught the Philistine bring it to their country and put it in one city praise God but God sent the plagues and they were scared and put it in another city God again send the plagues see and take it to another city God send the plagues again they take it to the five cities and God sent five plagues don't try to help God God God knew what he is doing see so when that happened the Philistine were so scared how can we fight against God we are just human so they called the high priest then the high priest said Okay if that is God then let God fight against God see so they took that Ark into the Temple of Deon they said let our God deal with this God of Israel and you know the god of Israel is so small and Deon is 100t high they said look look at their God it's so little so tiny compared with Our God so don't worry tomorrow everything will be finished right and they closed their Temple and that night they heard something loud boom he said it's finished the following morning when the high priest opened the door everybody was surprised they G their God their Idol fall down flat face flat oh my so the high priest said okay don't worry this is just a first round again try it again raise it up again and they said okay we're going to ask these young people people they're going to do some vils they will sing and praise our God Deon they close the door they sing continuously they shout continuously they keep on praising their gods see then in the middle of the night something happened again there's a loud Crush mhm boom and this something is broken to Pieces they said Oh Our God is so angry that's why maybe stump that God of Israel into pieces see then the following morning when the sun is starting to to rise you know they open the gate but they were so surprised their God God was broken into pieces was crushed into pieces and they said who can fight against the god of Israel what shall we do they took two kinds then they built a new card they put that card on the kinds they put the Ark of the Covenant there nothing happened they touch it nothing happened yeah then they put the gold you see they said we need to to give the god of Israel a peace offering give him some gold as our peace offering see all the plagues that he sent to us let's make it let's use the gold in the form of the plague that he sent us as a peace offering then the priest said okay if the kind went this way it means it is only by chance it is not the hand of Israel the god of Israel but if the kind went into beemus it is the hand of God of Israel see so the priest let they they face the kind toward there but the cattle went on this way turn its way into BSIS now they believe that is the hand of the god of Israel see so the kind wine into BSIS nothing happen nobody get killed nobody get killed Samuel chapter 6: 19 1 Samuel and is it says here 12 CH 6: 12-5 12 up up and the kind took the straight way verse 12 took the straight way to the way of BSIS and went along the highway loving as they went and turn not aside to the right hand or to the left and the Lords and the Lords of Philistines went after them unto the border of BSIS and they of BSIS were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the AR and rejoiced to see it and the cart came into the field of Joseph bsite and stood there where there was a great Stone and they climed the wood of the cart and offered a kind of burnt offering unto the Lord and the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord and Cofer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were put them on the great Stone and the man of bsem is offer bur offering and sacrifice sacrifices the same day unto the Lord nothing happened nobody got killed nobody got killed but then in verse 19 and he smot the man of BSIS because they had looked into the Ark of the Lord even is M the people 50,000 and three three score and 10 men and the people lamented because the Lord had Smitt many of the people with a great Slaughter and the man of ver 7 said who is able to stand before the holy God of is holy Lord God and to whom shall we go up from us shall he go up from us see so when they take the cart no problem they got hold of the Ark and put it down no problem Mercy is still there there is Mercy nobody die but something happened they took that Sher beam down nothing happened but when they remove that piece of food on top of that Ark of the Covenant Mercy is finished Mercy's finished people got killed see that one piece of food it looks insignificant but that is the mercy of God as long as it's in the top of that item of that Ark of the Covenant nobody will get killed but when they remove that Mercy is over see now Moses as long as Moses pleaded for his people God cannot touch them yeah remember that right God cannot touch them see the people were they they they they go against God Moses Lord please see when the people complain Moses did you bring us to this Red Sea in order for us to die in the seashore is there not enough grave Cemetery in Egypt for us to bury see Lord your people are crying what should I do okay I will open the I I will open the water then people cross then they got thirsty Lord your people were thirsty and and the water is so bitter don't worry Moses see cut down the tree and everything will be all right as long as Moses know how to plead God cannot touch them even and God was so angry I will wipe them out Moses and I will start with you don't worry I will start with you I will make you a great nation don't worry Lord don't do it you know what happened to us no I will kill them okay Lord but kill me first yeah kill me first if you want to kill them kill me first then God said because of you Moses because there is one Moses We Stand between the Gap Lord don't do it you want to do it K me first then God said I won't touch them Moses but then one day that's why I've been telling you to the minister watch your heart watch your heart then Moses you know he lost his patience remember that he lost his patience people got thirsty hang God said to Moses Moses just speak to the Rock no problem just speak to the Rock right but Moses he lost his patient he said you people you stiff naked people you rebels now before he keep on saying Lord help my brother you know where they come from you know what what happened to us Lord don't do it now he's the one that calling his people his Brethren his brother his sister stiff naked before it is God who's been saying he they are step naked Nation Moses said L Lord no but now here's Moses when he did that he hit the rock twice right he break all the typology but he still God's Prophet yeah but then God said okay Moses you're tired but you're finished I cannot use you anymore I cannot use you anymore because God did somebody between him and the people right that will reconcile the sin of the people people to him see he needs somebody praise God he says in Hebrew chapter 2 verse 17 Hebrew 2:17 wherefore in all things it behov him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be merciful and faithful High priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people he needs somebody see like his Brethren that has compassion to the people to the children of God a merciful faithful pertaining to the work of God right but then he cannot use Moses anymore see because Moses SED with God Moses sided with God God wants a person that can be touched by the infirmities of his Brethren see a priest praise God see a high priest faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the SS of the people that will say Lord look at my brother look at my sister Lord we are shapen in iniquity we come to this word speaking lies help us Lord for forgive my brother forgive my sister but when he sided with God he finished God cannot choose it anymore he wants somebody you know he choose Moses because Moses has the heart he has compassion to his people right see he has compassion to his people when Moses lose that compassion God cannot use him anymore when he call his people Rebels God cannot use him anymore right see he needs somebody between him and his people that will plead for his people but then Moses sided with God and that's finished him then God start to to use a priest see that's the start of what we call after Moses then God said to Moses you're finished let Aaron took as Aaron and his children to come with me wash them anoint them they will now become a priest now that's the start of what we call the priesthood the aonic priesthood see during that time only the family of Aon can become a priest there is the tribes of Levites Aon came from the tribe of Levites but only Aon only the family of Aaron can become a priest not all in the F not All in the Family of the tribe of Levites some family in the tribe of Levites they can work they can serve in the temple but when it come to priesthood only Aon but you know when the times goes on in the time of priest Eli remember him his son pineas and hni see Eli he favored his son he honored his son more than God God was so angry again that's why he used Samuel see Samuel tell him did I not choose you did I not choose your family but then he said I will cut off his hand praise God God was so angry with Eli see until the time see until the time of Solomon see you know priest high priest Avatar see Solomon praise God Hallelujah in first king chapter 2: 27 so Solomon trust out avatar from being priest unto the Lord that he might fulfill the word of the Lord which he spake conc in the house of Eli in Silo that's the end of a ironic priesthood that stopped the eronic priesthood but you know when Aon become a priest do you remember that Kora datan and a they go against Moses they said Moses do you think you are the only one that is Holy do you think God only called you we are also called by God MH see when that happened praise God God was angry Moses humbled himself he said to his his brother and sister look I did not call myself it is God okay he said God will prove you remember that they took that the rod you know the 12 rods you know and then the rod of Aon bed and it bear fruit see when that happened God was angry with Kora he said okay take their family and God killed them you know when that happened people complain praise God they question the Judgment of God don't question the Judgment of God when they complain praise God God was so angry he said Moses okay separate yourself from these people after God tell it to Moses praise God hallelujah see Numbers chapter 16 verse 45-48 look he said get you up 45 among this congregation that I may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces and Moses said unto Aaron take a sensor and put fire therein from off the Altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is R gun out of the Lord the plague is begone praise God the plague is begun and Aaron took as Moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people and and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague stay my look left and right people are dying people are dying see and Moses said the plag is start go Aon go to the temple make an atonement for the people take that sensor with you he went straight inside the Tabernacle praise God and take that sensor and he run back you know he run back and people just keep on dying left and right face for for falling face down left and die but when he when he you know when he stand where he stand the Bible said the plague is STO yeah death cannot cross on that one man one man right that cannot cross cannot pass through that body of Aon Aon become the mercy of God yeah see praise God imagine look at that brother praise God hallelujah see that's why God said I need somebody like your brethren praise God who is merciful who is a faithful high priest doing things pertaining to God see God God is looking for that person who is merciful see who will not go out Hallelujah and keep pointing finger praise God you serpent seed you son of the demon devil Hallelujah I know you are a serpent seed because you cannot accept this message you're finished God cannot use you that's why I've been telling it to the believer don't take that comp compassion take that out that compassion in your heart remember that thank you praise God God is looking for a priest not a judge Hallelujah see praise God so when Eli then Solomon praise God the time of Solomon so he put out Avatar he thrust out avatar from being prison to the Lord that is the last line of the priesthood of the aonic priesthood after that the levitical priesthood come in see anybody now as long as you are in the tribe of leevi you can be a priest see you can become a high priest as long as you are in the tribes of Levites first as long as you are in the family of Aon you can be a high priest outside the family of Aaron you cannot be a priest praise God hallelujah until the time of abot the priest that he is the last lineage of Aaron then now all the levitic all the Levites can become a priests praise God hallelujah see so when Jesus come on that time there is the levitical priesthood serving the temple that's why the Bible is very clear as long as there are priests on this Earth he cannot come as a priest that's why when Jesus come on Earth he come as a son of man right see because there are priest that's serving in the temple priest that will praise God perform praise God that is pertaining to the Lord see Hallelujah that's why Jesus said destroy the temple I will build it in 3 days and you know the Jew cannot understand it there are three things that that you need okay if you are going Paul knew it if you are trying to give a Jew a religion they need the three things first is the temple second is the sacrifice see third is the priest without these three elements there is no Temple worshipping for the Jew see that's why in The Book of Hebrew Paul is trying to tell them he start he said praise God do you know how God speak to us in the beginning praise God he speak in s times he said he speak to signs and wonders praise God see and then finally he speak through the prophet then he said at at the end he speak through his son am see praise God then he speak about the angel about the man then he speak about praise God hallelujah chapter 3 chapter 4 about the Sabbath because because you need to address it praise God Paul knew it Paul will not just accept praise God a religion that has nothing to do with Judaism praise God Paul then Paul said it is a shadow of the good things to come see the blood of the animal cannot cleanse cleanse us it can only cover the sin but it cannot cleanse us but now here is the the real sacrifice once and for all he offer his blood right praise God one time then he said praise God see this Temple is made by the hands of man but this Temple it is not made by the hands of man but by the hands of God right so he keep on explaining it you know to the Jew because they need these three things Hallelujah then finally he said in Hebrew chapter 7 7 verse 1-1 17 see for this mcedc king of Salem priest of the prince priest of the most high God praise God slide number 12 who met Abraham returning from his Slaughter of the Kings and blessed him see so now Paul is trying to remind the Jew do you remember Meed because he needs to give them a priest right without the priest they cannot do the temple worshiping the Jew are looking for the priest praise God see so now Paul said do you remember madc he is the priest of the most high God in verse two he said to whom Abraham gave a 10 part of all first being by interpretation king of ch righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of king of Peace verse four he says now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tent of the spoils see now he said do you remember mcedc praise God he is the king of Salem he is the king of righteousness yes that's true but do you know that even Abraham gave TI thingss to him right see Abraham gave 10 of his spoil to him what does it mean that's why in verse 5 it said and verily that they are sons of Levi who received the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes he's trying to tell to the people look this Levites they are receiving tis M why they are receiving tis because they are priests yeah okay so now he is trying to tell to the people This MC he received even Abraham the Pat gave his titing to this man it means that he is a priest see and this madc he said praise God we verse 7 without contradic with all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive TI the Levi they received TI but there he received them of whom it is witnessed at Heth and as verse n and as I may also say Levi also who received ties pay ties in Abraham see so now then Paul is trying to tell them look this MC he even this he even receiv even the Levites pay tis to him see so Paul is trying to tell them it seems that this MEC priesthood is much higher than the Levi because even the Levites they pay their tights this Levites they are receiving titing but then Levites also pay their ties to this men praise God Hallelujah for he was he said for he was yet in the loins of the father liit when MC met him Hallelujah see Paul is trying to tell them how great is this priesthood that even Levites give their tithings to him right amen so it is higher the priesthood of MC is higher higher than the priesthood of the levite praise God but then verse 11 H Allelujah in verse 12 if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what farther need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melc and not be called after the order of Aeron for the priesthood being changed there is made a necessity a change also of the law praise God see Hallelujah see now he said if we need to change the law praise God if we need another priesthood praise God there must be a law to supers it there must be a law higher than the than the first one if we want to change it see God is God of law remember that we have this law of gravity praise God hallelujah see everything must come down when you throw the ball it will come down because of the law of gravity but how come the bird like the prophet say how come the bird can fly see because there is a certain law in his body praise God that supersede the law of that gravity Hallelujah see so we need the law praise God if you want to change this priesthood we need a law see how this how this levitical priesthood become a priest praise God hallelujah it says here verse 13 for he of whom these things are spoken pertaining to another tribe of which no man gave it attendance to The Altar for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning prood okay according to the law because it is according to the law all only the levitical the Levites can become a priest right but pertaining to Jesus he was born in the tribe of Judah and pertaining to Judah there is no law that will make him a priest see and how can Jesus become a priest hallelujah how can he become a priest if there is no law that will make him a priest then he said you remember me he has no father he has no mother he has no beginning he has no end it means that he remain a priest see then he said can it be in the similitude praise God can it be this 4 verse 15 for that after the similitude of melc there ariseth another priest see but how did melchisedek became a priest that's why the Paul said he has no beginning he has no end right it means that he's aernal priest praise God hallelujah that's why he said here in verse 16 you know the levitical priesthood there were made according to the law of the carnal commandment they become priest because of this carnal commandment but this one praise God he can only become a priest with another law what is that law the law of without beginning and Without End the law of the the power of the Endless life right see that's why he said he test testify it you are a priest he testified he said to the Lord you are a priest in the order of madc see how can he become a priest and how can we become a priest see remember that he made us King he made us priest but how can we become a priest come on see we need a law we need a certain law we cannot be become a Levi we are not born under Israel how can you become a priest what law Hallelujah see same thing the law of eternal life see once you have that law in your body sir praise God you know the Catholic do we have some Catholic here do we have Catholics here see Philippines is a 95% Catholic so we know the power of the Catholic and all priests they have an order you

us priest amen exactly the law of eternal life right Hallelujah see you are a priest in the order of madc right amen praise God hallelujah look now the prophet said now the levitical priesthood cease at the death of the Lord Jesus now we live in the Mec priesthood of Christ see when Jesus was on Earth he cannot be a priest because there is a priest on this Earth performing in the book of Hebrew Paul said he cannot be a priest because somebody is is doing the job in the temple is doing that work in the temple that's why when he come here he was the son of man when he went to heaven remember when he was on Earth as a son of man yeah they saw this woman man commit adultery he said according to Moses according to the law he should die she should die then he said okay those who have no sin throw the first stone everybody left the sin right until there's Jesus only then he said I forgive you they were surprised only God can forgive but Jesus said the son of man has power to forgive sin exactly right right but then when they crucify him that Chang the ministry from the son of man to the Son of God father forgive them when he was on Earth as a son of man I forgive give you when he was lifted up on Earth he is now the Son of God as the priest yeah father forgive them that's why he is a priest that can be touched with our infirmities Hallelujah but then at the opening of the seals something happened again yeah see the prophet said I want to teach this I want I want this the message of indictment he keep on saying he wants to preaches until praise God when the seals is open praise God that is finally he said he went into the message of the trial court trials then finally he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion right see that fulfill when Moses hit the rock twice but is also fulfilling something see praise God the ministry now is changing is changing from the Son of God again coming down as the son of man praise God hallelujah see that's why he preaches marriage and divorce remember that when he preached that marriage and divorce he laid down all the rules then he said at the end it is not it is not God it is Paul it is not Moses is is is the god this is Moses yeah Moses pleaded for the for his people Paul pleaded for his people I plead for my people too yeah then after the service he said go your way stay where you are remember there is one woman who understand what he's trying to tell yeah and he is a woman preacher he understand what brother Bram is trying to teach that he's forgiving the people how can you do that only God can forgive sin then he preached who is this madc he's trying to show us who you are that's right who you are see Hallelujah last slide that's why Paul said here in 1 Corinthians chapter 7: 12- 14 but to

more time Amazing Grace amaz great How Sweet the S bless like me I want was was blind but now I see who is he he's the Lord isn't he he's the one we're all looking for is he amen enjoy the message amen let's give our brother a good hand as we're going into the communion make me you go ahead and go back we'll go into the communion part because it's the one thing that we are firm Believers in and we had to pass it up last weekend because we were having a lot of things to go on and you know and so we moved it over to this weekend to have the communion and all but just tell our brother how much you appreciate him and if anybody has anything else we always take care of the offering if anybody has anything else you'd like to give our brother you know for anything uh feel free to do and just if you want to write a check write it to the church and it'll go right straight to him whatever you want to do if you want to give him an extra doing but make sure you tell him how much you appreciate him ministering because we appreciate the ministry I believe in it and I thank God for it because that's what it is see everybody's a priest and a king because we're all in the same category but what about the ministry the it's not just priests and Kings cuz everybody's a priest and King we're all the same but then the ministry is brought into to another level on that right see you ain't got another priest and King to put it but it is another level because that's God's way of doing things is it amen if you'd like to follow along in your scripture turn to First Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus in the same night the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner all so he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in Rememberance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat e and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves I love this we should not be judged we have to judge ourselves but what if we don't look what he goes on to say but when we are judged see he'll he'll take care of we're going to be judged for it we're chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world see that's a wonderful thing for him to do that for us you know not talking about worldly sin of everything in the books but just something may be sometime a little wrong a little point a little thought or an idea and you just don't get rid of it that's why when we come to the communion part then we take just a moment of time to pray and get you know to get rid of everything to where we don't have to be all right wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him meat at home that you come not together un condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer and just remember like I said getting rid of all the things to where that we don't have no problems no condemnation no thoughts and let it be you know that God would take care of all things father we thank you for this day and opportunity that you've given us to be able to sit down and listen to your word we thank you for that because it's a great time we are truly priests and kings we have a kingdom to rule over and we have a lot of things it's within that is to our benefit but most of all we have the ministry to speak to our hearts and bring us to let us realize who we are and what we're doing here so we just ask you now that you'd make us worthy to be able to take this communion because it's not nothing we could do it's what you've already done and we believe you and we thank you we just ask you to bless and guide each one in Jesus name yeah Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread It's Made for This purpose this afternoon that we could just think about you think about it we know it's not your body but Lord It's the word spoken to our hearts and our thoughts is transmitted then back into our lives and we take a piece of bread and we think about you in your word and we just ask you Lord to sanctify this bread this natural and Lord to sanctify the partakers that we may all be together as one in you forgive our sins and lead us in Jesus name always when we're taking to communion I think about the children of isra and they didn't even know what they were doing but yet as they would come down and then they were given the Passover and the things and to realize it would come right on down to where we are today it come right into the time and the point and we' understand the communion because it would be in your word and that to me is why that none of the Apostles even though they all you know Matthew Mark Luke John and all of those even though Luke was not original but yet he's right in there close and marked and all like that but still in none of the writings of Peter or any of them they were not chosen to tell about the communion here's the Apostle Paul comes along as one born he set out a due season and yet he's given the understanding of the communion to speak cuz he had all the Old Testament background he was a great scholar of the word he knew what all of those things made and you know they done certain things right in our to last Wade preaching on it one time for us as it did there were certain things that were done that spoke of the communion Jesus wasn't out of the word or adding something new he was the word wouldn't father we thank you for this wine it's gone through the process now and it's getting better every day we know that it's a type of your blood that was shed for each one of us and as we eat the bread and we drink the little little wine with it Lord tomorrow that'll be actually blood cells in our body that we can live off of and how much more sure is it that we can live off your word that has been spoken unto us by your servants and things and down to time and revealed unto us what this really is it's not the body and not the blood but it's standing in the place of until the time comes we thank you Lord for all of these things sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name come morning and I walk by the river I'll rest the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on you know as I said a lot of times maybe you wonder why we sing it taking to communion but just remember the communion is for the Overcomer and when it's finished here then you go out to face the world and walk in Christ right well you know what happened there in the Bible times when they went to war the singers went first what if there's an enemy up there getting ready to battle and think boy we going to have a good day today and they just start singing and they just start walking right towards you and they're just singing and no wonder we don't understand what being priest and King is all about what if you had a kingdom that every one of your subjects in that Kingdom Naturally Speaking what if you had a kingdom that every one of you your subjects in that kingdom was a David they could kill a Lon a barar a giant you understand what I'm saying see we're the children of almighty God and we are the point to where that would be greater than David because David was just anointed we don't have just the anointing we have the Life of Christ thank you the one that guided That Rock in it right at that Goliath we have him living in us so then we can sing it can't we come morning I walk by the river I'll rest the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question you ever do it father how long did I just take one more look in Mount Calvary where was all made possible to make us priests and kings of almighty God Amen come morning I walk by the river our rest the Ever Green tree I'll car my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me amen and amen and amen what a wonderful time for people to be able to understand the things that Mankind through time time is not being able to comprehend but it's given unto you and I to know and understand the Mysteries especially this day the time to end it all up amen it's all in finishing up right let's all protect together together you can be seated for a moment till we get through and get everything ready you like to follow in the scriptures turn to John 13 begin with verse to and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and he went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter Peter said unto him Lord th th wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him you know it took a long time before Peter ever really come to that knowledge of what it was all about wasn't it and when he did then he said Lord I don't want to I don't want to even be hung on the cross the way my Lord was Hang Me Up di down he began to see all right and cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet watch him Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me see that strong arrogant pet he's you ain't going to do that but when he he said if I don't wash you I no part do he and I like what he said because the two things that needs to be worh just watch Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but my hands and my head that's the worst part right Jesus sath unto him he that is worh needeth not say to wash his feet but is clean every with and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him the for said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and would set down again he said unto them know you what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your lord if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together and be dismissed the sisters will go downstairs for the foot washing time father we thank you for the time that we've had today with our brother in the ministering of Thy word and as they travel on their ways and continue on he's ministering other places and all Lord we pray that you'd be with them and be with the the sister and the brother they traveling with them and just take care of them give them a safe journey and Lord just let your loving grace be with each one of us and guide us all and father we go now to have the foot washing time and we lord we just give you the honor and glory for bringing us to a place of realizing that we're all servants we're not the owner and the master we're ser servants there's no problem for a servant to bow down and wash his master's feet because he recognizes what's going on and we pray that you would just bless each one then after it's finished give us all a safe journey home Lord and be with Wade and June and brother reading them as he going and picking them up and bringing them back and he's got to preach tonight there Lord and then coming on end and we just ask you to be with them have your way with all of us and guide us in Jesus name amen you dismissed the
