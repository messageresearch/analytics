I hope the Lord does good to be in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles go ahead and turn to the Book of John brother dick I want to show take that that is a program from a message church we talk about programs all the time that's that place up in New Jersey take it and look it over it's pretty neat but good to be in the house of the Lord amen John 12 good to see each and every one of you hope hope youall had a good day today had a wonderful time just singing the Praises of the Lord today and uh fellowshipping with him so uh it is a it is a burden on my heart about brother Bill uh we just returned back from New Jersey a couple of weeks ago and he seemed to be in very good health so you never know right his coughing had been a lot better and he was trying to eat right and do do the right thing and and then here is uh here he's laying in the hospital with a with a stroke so I think he's uh 67 years old so just keep him in your prayers I I'm praying that uh it just impressed on my heart to go see him so maybe dad and I or myself for sure to going Friday to go see him so u i ride up and doesn't matter if I get to see him or not I want to make my I I want to you know he he's a buddy he's a good friend of mine you know so I I just want to uh to show him our support you know it's it gets lonely in the hospital when there's nobody there Danny had a pretty good support group with him but there was probably times when he was a little bit lonely and there's probably times when he wanted us all to leave but but that's so especially Joy but uh we all need support we're still human we all have human thoughts and ideas and you get to sit in the hospital like that and you get to think a lot cuz you don't get to do anything else so just please remember him in your prayer he it's just been a burden on my heart all day so he's he's not only a good friend he's a brother in the Lord so and known brother Bill for a long time and U know him to be a real true Christian man and I was just thinking today all the all the many great man of Faith all the great all the ones that he's prayed for that have been healed and the things that he's ministered to people I said Lord just take that and Heap it right back on him amen take all that take all that faith and all that word and all that all that U uh laying on of hands and the healing of the sick that's been in his ministry just Heap it back on him and and give him that power to uh to raise up out of that thing and we believe we got a god that'll do it doesn't matter what the doctor says the doctor can just tell you what's on a piece of paper but God doesn't work on pieces of paper he works on faith and faith is the substance of things HED for the evidence of Things Not Seen so let's bow our heads before we get started and uh talk to the author dear heavenly father we pray Lord you would come Among Us now and just be with us in a special way tonight father just break the words of eternal life to each one of us just Lord may we have faith for our journey and Lord as we have faith for our journey may we have a little left over to go to brother Bill and to go there in the hospital room where he is and Lord just a a good friend and a good buddy and and a and a gallant Soldier been preaching and ministering for for 40 30 something years and just bless him Lord just raise him up for your honor and Glory we know that the doctor looks at things one way and Lord you look at them totally different because your Healing Hand by one touch would be more than a thousand doctors could ever do and we pray now that the great physician will go to our brother and just heal him and raise him up for your honor and glory Lord and we expect to see a miracle yes Lord we expect to see you move on the scene and help our brother Lord there's a time there that he's he's not able to speak and he's not able to be conscious but Lord we know that his conscience is working we know that he's somewhere in that body and he's thinking about things and Lord just may you impress on him that the saints of God are praying for him that all around the country that men and women of Faith are are are sending out prayers for our brother and Lord I pray that you'd be with us here Lord just teach us something tonight father just let us always be in your will Lord bless the foreign missions Lord be with them give them fruit for their labor Lord take care of each one tonight we pray that you would just bless the ones that are not here the ones that are sick Lord not among us Lord that are sinick that that are dilatory Lord that that backslid or whatever what Lord I pray that you would just speak to their heart Lord you're still a God that comes on the scene and heals but you're also a God that will heal the soul you're God that'll heal that soul and make it whole father we pray that you do that tonight Lord we ask you to bless all the rest of the service now Lord we lay it in your hands use us Lord as your for your honor and glory and no one else for in Jesus name we ask these things amen want to um kind of give you a little thought tonight that uh we've been talking in the Sunday school class and it kind of impressed on me the other day we were heading down through the statue of a person perfect man and get into faith and and all that and and sometimes as a minister you'll know uh the Lord will go you need to be in Reverse you need to back up you miss something so we backed up a little bit and and we missed a point and I want us to see this point and I want us to really really listen tonight cuz it's going to it's not going to be I only got about three pages of notes so most of them scripture so we're going to be in the Bible so hang on to your Bible or or watch the screen so let's go with John 12:28 we're going to title this glorify it again John 12:28 says father glorify thy name now there's only one name for the father right that's who Lord Jesus Christ all right father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again again right what's that it Thy Name all right and where's his name in the end times in his bride amen all right so we we got to come to that point and then verse 29 the people therefore that stood by and heard it said it thundered others said an angel spoke to him but look at the bottom one Jesus answers and said this voice didn't come because of me right it become it came because of you and it wasn't just for your sake of the people that was sitting there 2,000 years ago it's for our sake today all right so you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word but we look and see that we've been speaking on the Statue of a perfect man and and we kind of like I said we kind of feel felt a little check to back up a little bit and to take a look I'm going to put a prayer cloth in my pocket and we're going to pray over it and Lord willing if we get to take this to brother Bill we'll lay it on him cuz I'm sure he absolutely absolutely believes in prayer and prayer cloth so we're going to take this and and we've seen what it'll do right all right so Jesus answered said this voice came not because of me but for your sake all right now let's go to John 13:31 and let's read there John 13:31 and 32 therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and go now son of man right now what is the son of man the word made flesh GL not Son of God he look how it's it's it's very specific it says now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him amen but now watch if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself they're one amen all right and shall straightway glorify him so in other words he's going to be glorified he's glorifying the father then we got the son of man which is the word made flesh which is God in human flesh all right so that's what he's saying he's putting all all these together just like where it says in John 14 that I and you and you and me all right same thing it's putting it together not separating it putting it together all right so let's go to one more and let's see because remember remember the voice Came From Heaven I have both glorified it and will glorify it again all right so he's glorified it and going to glorify it again and we're just going to take one point here and look at it because there's two glorifications all right St John Matthew uh St John St Matthew 179 now here's the one that we always go to and and uh and read where Jesus was on the mountain and this is the adoption stage right this is where you know Jesus was up on the mountain and God said hear ye him but remember he was there with two characters Moses and Elijah so keep that in your head for a little while because we're going to use it at the end of the service as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man not the Son of God right the son of man be risen again from the dead so that means he's going to raise two times right right he raised physically back there 2,000 years ago and he's raised in the end time right in a group of people all right so now keep that in your mind and and look because you're seeing that it's the son of man it's the word made flesh Jesus is saying son of man son of man son of man and so we see in the end time that we know what that son of man is all the other people in the other ages didn't know what the son of man was they just knew that God was in human flesh yeah okay then that only happened for about two Church ages because in about the Third Church age it became a like substance of God and they started using Father Son and Holy Ghost even the Believers amen come on Luther was a trinitarian Wesley was a TR trinitarian they took that Doctrine from ncia back in 3:25 and 606 they took that and they established it and God winked at that and said that's okay but I'm going to glorify it like I had glorified it before all right the son of man is going to raise again because without the son of man you don't have a body change all right you can have the Son of God all you want to now listen for for those of you that hadn't been here for a while the Son of God is God in spirit form all right does everybody understand that he died son of man he raised Son of God all right then what happened the Son of God is the Holy Ghost right that comes back on the day of Pentecost in a group of Believers right which put them in the body of Christ but now it it did put them in a position but don't get me don't get don't say something I'm not saying they were at a position but they couldn't come to full Authority right right because they had took the father son Holy Ghost baptism they took it hell was eternal they took these things that you can marry whoever you want to just like he said you know in marriage and divorce and all these they got all scrupled up and God couldn't use them now look God used the son of man amen it was the son of God working through the son of man right Son of God working through the son of man not two different people right but the spirit in Jesus Christ was the Son of God the Creator right cuz remember they told him they said you're the Creator God you're the one that created the world well that Jesus flesh man was not the one that did it right that was a creation sure it came from God and it was God right if it come from God it had to be God if God created it it had to be God especially if he dwell in it all right now but I want you to look at the two things that in Jesus's life because I want you to see something here I think it's something that we're missing but just kind of pencil this in your brain Jesus started at a river with a glorification right this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell he was identifying where he was God was identifying the person that he was dwelling in cuz he was pleased to dwell in that person then you come on the mountain and it's not just that he's he's pleased to dwell in that person that person has come to a position to where the father says hear ye him right all right so it said so we got two places of glorification we got the river and a mountain now you start your journey in a river and end it on a mountain same thing amen cuz we have to have something to look at we have to have some a guide and Jesus is the guide right right not any other man there's no other perfect man except Jesus Christ right but I'm going to sting you here for a second because watch brother Brandman 1962 go aead and pull that quote up statue of a perfect man 10:14 1962 this is the part I missed that the Lord said go back and read this cuz I think we're missing it and I know brother Bown say we're missing it in life and that's exactly where we're missing it at okay but I I have them I have a big note here says everybody wants to know about the seal see my Sunday school class was full when I was preaching on this when I was teaching on on the seals but now statue perfect man half the people don't come it's reverse people you don't know one thing about the seals until you're right here exactly was brother brandham adopted and then God gave him the SE revelation of the seals you think you're any better than William brandham I don't think so watch what he says now we are approaching the seven seals we have just finished the seven Church ages right cuz the seven Church ages if you look in the church seven Church ages in the church age book there's your doctrines that were missed down through the church ages right that's where the Son of God was working but the son of man couldn't work right amen son of man couldn't work because he was bound by Creeds and dogmas like Dy is preaching to now and same thing with us with the Holy Ghost goes we're Bound by our own Creeds and denominational ideas right now all right you say why cuz we're still here once we leave out of here the son of man could leave out of here yeah that's right all right he went up he went through walls went up did anything he wanted to all power in heaven and Earth's been given unto me right so don't think we can get there any less but this is the part I was missing but watch just line up right here all right now we are approaching the Seven Seals now the seals were preached in 1963 right March of 1963 got it right watch how brother Brown builds up now they don't have this on the screen but I'm going to read it to you in a minute the sermons that brother Brandon preached between the church ages and the seals all right and the ones that are important that I think is important now we are approaching the Seven Seals we have just finished the church ages all right he's finished something here he's going to the seals over here but now watch what he says and this is a message on teaching to tie the man in right to tie the man in amen that's going to be redeemed I thought you were already redeemed if you born again you are potentially right but not fully right right amen this is yes this is no you can amen a little bit louder praise the Lord that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and is going to be in that church age now watch him he stops not one of the seven Church ages he says that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals amen so he's placing he's placing what he's doing doing because look what he said right down below that and I thought that would this would tie in just where I was expecting amen he's talking about the Statue of a perfect man now the he brother Brown preached the church ages then he preached the spoken word is Original Seed he thought he had preached everything and he said as of yet M you remember the Holy Ghost said pick up your pen and write as of yet Malachi 4 has not been made manifest so brother Bram knew that Ministry had to move on it hadn't stopped it had to move all right then he preached Daniel said 70 weeks then he preached before the the Sunday before he preached this he preached on the key amen and he said the key is Faith and Christ is the door amen all right then he preached the statue of a perfect man and that night he preached on a guide right or the guide of my life all right so watch what he's doing then the next month he preaches on Blasphemous names and he brings it into the statue of a perfect man a higher order order of the Statue of a perfect man instead of just having faith virtue and all his tempers patience all right he goes through Blasphemous names and then he preaches the seals so you see how God is bringing the man William brandham to a place and that's what he's saying here he said I thought this would tie in just where I was expecting he could see that there was something coming he knew Malachi 4 hadn't been made manifest yet he knew there was something to come but because he had preached to hear amen now that's not a complete head that's not a complete pyramid right right amen got to have a cap on it and then remember he had there was a dream sister shepher had a dream where we read it downstairs where s sister Shephard had a dream and it wasn't the one where he ripped the top off and looked down in it now that's a different dream this one of sister shepher she had the dream brother brandom saw the dream and interpret it that there was water flowing out of a box a Mountain a man was pouring water in the box and trash was coming out well as I told him in the Sunday school class that's exactly what the statue of a perfect man does right it gets the extra trash out exactly cuz you don't have trash in your soul if you're born again but you do have trash in your spirit now we're not even going to talk about the body because I believe the body is motivated by the others right the body just reacts to what's inside of it so we can't say the body made me do this or or you know you can't say that cuz what motivated cuz you can uh Lord bless brother Bill but he's laying up there now and he can't move well now his body is controlled by whatever's inside he's still there his spirit's still working his Soul's still working but he can't there's something happened to the body all right electrodes and all the things that that brother Brown said Cosmic light so let's go to the book of Ephesians and we see that brother brandham has brought us to a place you see what's going on brother Bram God just didn't bring the seals and just dump them in his lap right and he's not going to dump them in yours amen that's right exactly so everybody wants to talk about Seal Seal Seal Seal seals what about that right what about that fully working in an individual brother Brown said a walking breathing instrumentality of God that's what he had to come to before God showed him the seal amen all right so let's just don't think well this statue of a perfect man well that's just something good to live by no I'm going to tell you something in just a minute that may blow your socks off all right for those of you that do have socks on for those of you that don't it just knock your shoes off I guess Ephesians 1 and whom also we have obtained an inheritance remember Jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance right right he came to bring you the the way back to your inheritance the door how to get in and how to go cuz your inheritance is eternal life predestinated before the foundation of the world you know I was thinking I was thinking today I have a lot of time to think sitting on that lawnmower and I enjoy it cuz remember I told you when I used to cut grass out here i' could preach my best sermons to that lawnmower so we had about 3 hours of just pure you know gutting and strutting with a lawnmower today and I had a lot of time to sing and pray and preach this sermon yeah and I probably got a little bit more out of the lawnmower at least it hollered the whole time some of y'all are wanting to go back to the house it's just what's motivating you inside but I thought about it today brother dick you know people say we were born with this seed in us predestinated but the only thing that was predestinated we know was the mind of God the word of God that's what's predestinated but now remember where did you come from naturally you didn't come naturally born with the seed that brought you here your father had the seed all the time right your father had the seed so where do we have to get our seed from the father we wouldn't come here born with it right that's right cuz remember brother Brown said even your father it was in you were in your great-grandfather what in the seed line the gene line right but you come when your father produced the seed not you exactly you don't produce it the father produces it right and if you weren't in him you're not of him right but if you were you got to come forth amen cuz God doesn't just like brother Ram said you you have god making you know having sex like with Mary but no he when he speaks it happens Glory when he speaks it's done when he speaks a seed comes forth it's not just one that's all messed up or one that's this and that and the other no he brings his own children all right so that just kind of struck me today that hey that is where the seed life comes to the father amen the father has to give the seed to give life right the father has to give it so that's where our seed come from our seed Gene that's predestinated was in the father and then brother Brown said in the bedding ground what's the B ground the word your mother is New Jerusalem that's the beding ground when the father releases that seed you coincide with what's in this word right not anything else what's in this word is where you where you get your Eternal destination or Preparation or predestination you're not predestinated by your Mom and Daddy right they didn't know you were coming he did amen that's what I love about God he knows that everything glory in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to our purpose no it says according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that's what I mean you were that seed you were a seed in your father amen your mother would just produce the body right your father produced a life all right so how would you how' you come here born with the seed of your own self you can't you got to receive the seed from your father in the beding ground to become you same way with the word of God same way with your new birth you got to receive seed from the Father which is eternal life right right spoken word is the Original Seed all right now look that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe D you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest you've heard this many times before but but let's let's split this thing apart and look at it and see because this is your earnest amen but not the full possession right all right this is your earnest your daddy gives you a check with his name on it right it says you write it I'll produce it right but when you get to a place in God he gives you a blank check you write it out for whatever amount you want and God will cash it and you have you sign your own name amen exactly so let's split this apart now we're not talking about two holy ghosts we're talking about the same Holy Ghost but just a refilling but I want you to see how this happens because it happened in Jesus's life amen in type he didn't need the Holy Ghost right he had the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was the spirit that motivated him the spirit in Sun Times and diers manners that spake through the prophets that was the spirit inside of Jesus that's why he could know and I didn't bring the quote but I was looking at it last night where brother brandham said that's why you don't know all things and that's why he did or he knew behind when he got here he knew where he come from we we just appeared right you know we just we just we had a time we were blacked out brother Brown said we our minds blacked out we were with the father in The spoken word we were with him but it was blackened out but Jesus could come and he could tell before Abraham was I am I was back there with Moses I was the one that did what now you you and I can't do that but he was literally there in the Son of God it was the son of God all right cuz it was Spirit God God wasn't in human flesh yet he was using human flesh but he wasn't in human flesh yet all right but look which is the earnest of our inheritance what's our inheritance eternal life Body Spirit and soul right Body Spirit and soul not just soul body spirit and soul all right which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory not ours all right brother Brown said in 1962 on question question and answers let's go to the next one talking about on Easter morning just scroll down to the part there that we want to read I'll give you the earnest of your inheritance and then what happened on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came upon the Believers there was the down payment right that's the earnest money all right so that's the part that you and I get at our new birth we get an Earnest all right not the full possession everybody in the building amen okay but I want you to think I'd like for me to realize you're here yeah if this was a ball game you'd treat it a whole lot different it'll motivate you this this must not that's what I mean about this if this don't motivate us you can forget about the seals amen you can forget about it it's like I told him downstairs I said look I believe this is what I believe now I'm talking about me too I believe we have a knowledge of the seals amen amen but it's brother Dale's Revelation or we wouldn't act the way we do H cuz brother brandham had a knowledge of the seals and preached them amen that's right but when he come and preached the seals and he preached um Satan's Eden and all these different ones about the garden all he said all that was revealed in the seals right he'd already preached it he had a knowledge but when it come to the seals he had a revelation and when you get a revelation right that's different right amen but I just believe we got a knowledge of brother Dale that he knows what the seals are I'm sorry told you to knock your socks off maybe some of you well it's going to it's going to make people either dig or or die one of the two right dig or die one of the two I'm sorry it's just we either got to lead follow get out of the way well hey how I mean look people look the Bible says that we're supposed to come to church more as the day approaches than we do before and some of you ain't seen in two weeks some of you ain't seen your wife and kids in the month where you at but oh you ready to go you got you know what the seals are no you got a knowledge of what he's got we got a knowledge of somebody else's truth that will kill you exactly that'll kill you you're a dead man walking right if that's what it is I'm talking to all of us because look go to John 16:13 now brother Brown says on the day of Pentecost the earnest the down payment now it's it's important you got to have a down payment for you buy the house right that's just required man must have got that from the Bible brother Donnie you know we need a down payment we need an Earnest do what we that's what's wrong with yeah that's right well you're exactly correct but you know you can look at this thing and see that how God is working because he does he he the bank's a little leery of you when they first let you borrow some money so they don't give you a lot of checks to write out of that or whatever if you if you get a a line of credit or something you know but you know what about 10 years down the road if you've done everything right come on about 10 or 10 or 12 years down the road you do everything right they can check your credit anytime they want to check it you don't get nervous when they start checking your credit now buddy when somebody gets nervous when they checking your credit you're in trouble but you see that same way with God that's the same way with God after a length of time we're going to see it happen to Jesus so it's going to have to happen to us after a certain length of time God don't get nervous we know God don't get nervous but he trust you with more the bank trust you with more you can walk in there and talk to that guy face to face that's what I told him before I said I in all the business I've ever been in I can walk back in that bank and I can look at Banker right in the eye cuz I have nothing to hide I have nothing I've done nothing wrong with money I've done I've done paid all what I need to pay so I don't all right what if you don't the Banker's not going to trust you right right you mishandle the word God's not going to trust you it's really simple it's all about life amen right cuz you know what we live life a lot more than we live other things life is a 24/7 deal okay except when you're sleeping and when you're sleeping you're still working right all right but now look let's see how let's see how this splits and and I don't like to say split but there is a split because God even said he said I've glorified it and I'll glorify it again okay so there's two different glorifications sure there's many refilling but I want to key on these two River and Mountain cuz that's the same way you and I got to start at a river and end on a mountain all right so now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth guide all right for he shall not speak of himself you got it right but whosoever he shall hear that shall he speak but whatsoever he shall hear what coming from you right that shall he speak and he will show you things to come right right so as you as you have the Holy Ghost here at Faith God's going to show you things to come a furtherment on the Revelation you get a revelation that you know what you were lost you needed God you needed salvation you needed something besides what you were yeah all right but now remember if we still do what we were you're not him in this picture right all right so come on now now I told him downstairs in second Peter 1 the Bible says add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge and what did I tell y'all downstairs add to what you have because if you don't have it you can't add it second Peter one says add to your faith virtue or add to what you have or add to your revelation of Faith virtue add to what you have knowledge add to what you have Temperance add to what you have patience right cuz you got to add it to what you have you can't add it to something else right you can't add it to some gre's Almanac or or James Dobson you can't add nothing to that all right not even God anyway because remember Peter at the gate beautiful the guy says I need some arms I need you know I need some help and Peter probably reached in his billfold and he said it's been a slim day at the fish market this week no you know what Peter said Peter and said Silver and Gold Have I known another words I can't produce the money to give to you to go to the doctor to help your infirmity right that's what he was saying right but he said Silver and Gold Have I None in other words I don't have the funds that I can say here go go see the doctor right he said but what I do have Bible says such as I have right what he had the virtues working in his life such as I have give I unto thee right rise up and walk amen and you know what the guy Drew from that checking account cuz Peter was full of money amen not this kind of money he was full of funds he had enough virtue that he could keep some and give some out Jesus had enough virtue to keep some and give some out cuz Peter said such as I have right he didn't know how to name it this was before he wrote second Peter so he had to develop and I believe when he wrote second Peter 1 he was going that's what happened at the gate beautiful I had virtue in my life enough to where that guy could draw and the check don't bounce right ain't that what brother Bram said right brother Bram said you try to draw off funds and the check bounces why there's no money there or there's no funds there so Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have amen give I unto thee so what Jesus was telling them Jesus was showing them said look when he there in John when he said I'll show you things to come he was telling them he said hey when I come back when I come back the spirit of truth I'm going to be the spirit of truth I'm your guide comforter counselor Prince of Peace all those things I am the god of your life kind strange brother Brown preached the guide of my life that night he knew what was leading and guiding him up that statue of a perfect man amen for he shall not speak of himself but who whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come so there was a furtherment of not just you must be born again all right there's more to that because there's more to the baby amen de five tomorrow one time she was five minutes old there's a difference but it's the same person right a big difference had all her faculties she had all her fingers she had all her toes she had all of her faculties to use but she don't use them like she does now I'll promise you that she's sitting in there back there now drawing well she couldn't draw at 5 minutes old why she developed right cuz she was born now the statue of a perfect man notice this is statute of perfect man Jeffersonville this is right at first paragraph 102 notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith right all right so here right here here's the Holy Ghost working right here right okay right Elementary but we're getting somewhere with this all right so this is this is the first time God's glorified you CU if he said I'm pleased to dwell he said the same thing to you it's in your birth all right I'm pleased to dwell in this vessel all right notice you must be born again when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of it right all right let's go to the second one of the number six you've got to be born again and born again it produces Faith all right then after you get Faith this right here f t I think he's pointing down here at the chart then you're just in position of growing amen you're just in position of growing you're just in position of growing amen all right so now Jesus at the river when Jesus Come to the River and come up out of his baptism the sound from heaven was this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell right stop there in whom I'm pleased to dwell all right now that is a type we know he does not need the Holy Ghost but there's a type something did come something did descend on Jesus all right we know it was a a part of the ministry that he had for the three and a half years but now you and I you have use that as a type because it is when he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell so he's pinpointing right brother Brown said called it one time his coronation day well see on the coronation day you don't you don't Crown a king to make him a king you produce the king and say here is the King this is the guy that's going to lead the country that's your coronation day all right that's what that Jesus was that God was doing he was saying this is where I'm going to be at least for three and A2 years right this is where I'm going to be and I'm going to be speaking and I'm I'm going to be producing my children from this oh yeah right didn't what brother Bri said I can't remember where he said it but he said this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed right and from this part of the earth I'll redeem others in other words paraphrasing hope I don't get in trouble doing that like Claude said you can paraphrase a scripture but you better not paraphrase a quote he said they'll burn you hide so that's fine with me cuz you know what we're not going to be carrying these around in heaven we're going to become this when John ate the book it disappeared and the next time it showed up was at the white Throne judgment cuz that's where we were and the book was open all right so Jesus at the River Watch but now you say well Jesus was God and he this and he okay go to Luke 2 and the child grew GRE and white strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him now this was after that he was found in the temple at 12 years old and he said I must be about my father's business and then he went on with this with u with Mary and and Joseph all right so the Bible says in Luke he's he's he's narrating it and he's saying the child grew and whack strong in spirit filled with wisdom knowledge wisdom right and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature now that's not statue right that doesn't mean he grew up taller stature right all right and in favor with God and man so he went from somewhere to somewhere right that's right and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man now let's look at Hebrews 5 and8 Hebrews 5:8 says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered right and being made perfect amen are complete we know Jesus was perfect but he was being made complete what he was the Statue of a perfect man so he had to have these things working in his life but at 13 years old he didn't he didn't he didn't have all he didn't even know when he was coming back until we're going to read that in a minute about the glorification on the mount Transfiguration right right remember brother R said he didn't know anything about his coming Moses and Elijah had to tell him when he was glorified all right so the man Jesus grew being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation now it doesn't stop there it says unto all them that obey him amen brothers and sisters this is obedience right this is obedience plain and simple this is obedience and Jesus became obedient because he was made complete so he became the author of Eternal salvation for those that obey him amen all right that's why I said everybody says they want to know about the seals about the seals well Jesus in Matthew 17 he preached the seals in what Matthew 24 right Matthew 17 he found out about when he was coming so he had to grow in Grace and knowledge he had to grow up the word made flesh because look this is where we're missing it amen right here let me give you a let me give you a wayale quote and I'm going to paraphrase this one because this mine I'm the author of it the virtues are requirement to understand how the son of man acted on Earth until we see and know how the son of man acted on Earth we know he we know the Son of God we know how he acted he created the world he was the Jehovah God he was the one that looked over his children he was the one that did this and that and the other got it but the son of man comes down to one individual person and that was the word made flesh and without these virtues that's why they're a requirement cuz you can't be the son of man bride supposed to be the son of man in the end time right you can't be the son of man without these virtues working in your life cuz you don't know how he acted that's right or reacted for some of us so that's why everybody wants to know about the seals why cuz that somebody else is good Revelation I'm saying brother Dale's got a perfect understanding of the C but is it just that we understand what he understands Judas had an understanding of who Jesus was that's why but that's why brothers and sisters that's so close right that's the closeness it ain't these false Doctrine is out here no it's not it's right here it's whether you've got your own personal revelation that you have virtue that you have knowledge that you have Temperance that you have patience that you have godliness brotherly kindness cuz we're going to see see that Holy Spirit that's why I saw the split and actually Sunday sister Trudy and I were we clicked on brother Aaron McGary preaching out in Kansas and he was preaching on the same identical thing about the about the glorification and that you know that's kind of where I put all this together about already we'd already talked about it in Sunday school class but see Jesus come to a place to where when he went on that mountain God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell he didn't forget that part but then he said hear ye him I have usted all of my virtues about it it's where we got to be I have God is saying this I have entrusted all my virtues in you that's right father glorify thy name John 12 let's go back to it just a second father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it at the river and glorified again right now whatever scripture is for him has got to be for us amen cuz we're the bride we're the end time we're his body here on Earth right so we have to be the son of man come on the word made flesh that's why that's why I had to come back to this cuz we I was just going to go start through the virtues and we were just going to go up the virtues and I believe the Lord stopped me and said look to know how the son of man acted on Earth that's what these virtues are for they're not just something that brother randam stuck in between the seals and the church ages to fill it's not a filler that's right right I believe from 1960 on you could see him he had a pattern of where he was going and he even said it on that quote he said I saw where this fit right in so that's what happened is God was remember it wasn't brother Brown's message right it was God's message to me and you a lot of it wasn't even to him he's gone oh my he's gone he's not even we are we are which are alive and remain anymore right right come on but God promised the father promised he was going to glorify it and glorify it again so in the end time this is where we see that and this is not just a good-look chart that says oh we we need to do this no it's a requirement but it's a requirement to know how to know how to fit this onto this right exactly there's the seals amen that's right see you see oh we want to know the seals so as people come in they go oh we want to hear about the seals so we'll go down in hear Brother Wade about the seals there'll be 18,000 people in the in the um downstairs in the Sunday school class hey I'm telling you it hurts my feelings and then you start talking about life and the virtues and people disappear they ain't got time right right come on Pastor am I right come on people we got this thing backwards this all the way up to here is what Peter James John and Paul already had right and let me not put this in a derogatory way but that's old news we should already be living that GL right now with what word we've got brother Brandon preached to hear people not to hear so that's old news that's stuff that we should be it should be everyday life should be lived and all those virtues working come on right cuz what's he going to cap everybody wants to know what the Capstone Revelation is yes what's he going to cap what's he going to sit on brother BR said you can't have a a Capstone of steel or or of stone and a body of Steel right won't fit you got to have a body of stone and a headstone right all right of stone but now listen and I want us to kind of shake oursel and and realize that Jesus even saying here he said this wasn't for me right it's not for me amen it's for you that's right Glory that's like when he was at the tomb of Lazarus I mean Jesus had already seen the resurrection four days ago right he' already seen a vision that Lazarus was going to raise from the dead cuz he said he sleep right he said he sleepeth but remember he prays out loud and he says this is not for me right this is for you standing around right what to build their faith he didn't need Faith he was Faith amen but you and I you got to come to the place to where these three things of our being which is the body the body it only reacts that's right the body reacts to what's motivated on the inside all right the spirit and I like this I kind of picked this up from brother Aaron and real good brother out there in in Texas but he said the spirit is the character see we're Body Spirit and soul the spirit is the character now to me these are character Builders right right cuz remember in your soul it's either Faith or doubt right there's no actually the soul is already sealed put in Heavenly places done finished if you're born again sitting in Heavenly places right that's where your soul is right but your spirit which is the character of you is what is down here because like I told them before downstairs remember in that Spirit realm there's not a lot to do with future right let's take them for just a minute memory you don't have a memory of what you're doing tomorrow CU you ain't got there yet but you got a memory of what you did in your past reason you reason forward but you reason for what you reason from what you did in the back right right conscience my gosh we know where that comes from it's all back you can't have a conscious see that's why brother Ram said the conscious of a sear is together right subconscious and conscious he can see that way and that way you can only see that way right you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow okay memory reason conscience affection how can you love something and not know what it is right so you're working off your past and Imagination sure you can imagine forward but most time your imagination is what you is built on what you did in the past right so those five senses in that Spirit realm is where we've got to like brother Ernie said we got to do a paradigm shift we got to quit looking at the past cuz you know the Soul's not looking at the past right Faith or doubt exactly you either born again or not now if you're not then you're definitely in the past you're actually like the Frog you turn around you're looking you're looking in your past but you see if you're born again it's Faith or doubt and that's the real you well what it's trying to do is it's trying to move its way out it's trying to make itself become the character of Jesus Jesus Christ because the Son of God is in you if you're born again the Son of God is in you trying to be the son of man yeah oh yeah right cuz now remember Jesus didn't have no flu exactly yep Jesus didn't have the flu stopped up in his Spirit he could move back and forth so that made him the son of man he was the word made flesh and you know what though he had thoughts in his mind just like you do and I do so we can't say well I'm just human and I have these thoughts well Jesus had them too he just said the prince of this world's come and has nothing in me resist the devil and they'll flee from me you know it's so simple things like that but see Jesus didn't have his flu stopped up so he could work he could take that soul and work it out into his spirit and then his body reacted right right you and I have a problem we were born wrong right so we got a lot coming in this direction right remember brother Brown said the flues get stopped up why with what memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where it gets clogged up you say well how can we get rid of it somehow God made a road map for that to happen because that's not the virtue of a man that's the virtue of God right A lot of people have virtue brother Brown said and I didn't bring the quote with brother R and he said there's many people has these virtues but they're they're humanly right um performed I guess you might say just like Brother Richard Wilson said there was a guy at worked there that you could just take his paycheck and rip it up and throw it away or say I'm taking $50 out of your paycheck and he said that's fine it's just some people made like that but when you have the virtue like Peter had the virtue somebody needed something he had the money in the bank right he didn't have to go get it or go find it he didn't have to go find a quote book yeah that's what I'm saying he didn't have to go find a quotebook right he didn't he and you know he didn't even say Jesus said right he said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have that I received on the day of Pentecost such as I have I give unto you wonder how we going to do it it's a position of understanding it's a position of understanding that's why brother Ram said you you know where you at with God it's just like I said if you don't come to church more now than you did 6 months ago you're backslid right amen absolutely backslid is is a as a almost like a sinner cuz the Bible says much more as the day approaches right you should be here amen and amen I need this that's right this ain't just a ritual I need a I need can you get your fuel out there I want somebody to show me what job means more what mother means more brother sister hey when jun's father comes to our house he sits at home at my house on Sunday by himself or either comes to church with us you know what and he knows that there's not some surprise that comes up and says I got to take care of my mom today it's Sunday it's preparing ourself right because if we don't prepare oursel something's going to hit us right it's like mom when she was taking care of of of Grandpa when he was when he had cancer she said hey girls or and son and brother I'll stay with him all week but somebody's going to stay with him on Sunday right right I'm coming to church and you know what they cowboyed up and you know she got the worst end of the deal cuz she was there more than any of them but that one day her daddy was dying Jesus wasn't just spitting Stones when he said forsake father mother sister how many times will we all let all that get in the way all that stuff just mud you know what it does it condemns you and when it condemns you it stops you from going up that statue of a perfect man all of us see and that's one I me we we we glory in the holy spirit that we have here don't get me wrong it's the most important thing in your life amen right but how you act afterwards cuz if Deanna she's going to be a tall girl hey baby she's going to be a tall girl but you know what if we would have stopped feeding her at about 2 years old she'd either died or she'd be malnutrition or she'd have some kind of disease you know how a long time ago when that what was it called rickets or something that you had rickets because of vitamin C right there was no V just one one little vitamin one little church service I'm telling you people we're letting other things get in our way but yet we want to know about these great things but have you had a Mountaintop experience yet that's my whole point that's if you had a Mountaintop experience exactly because Jesus had to come to a place to where Moses and Elijah had to tell him about his second coming so don't think you going to get by without a Mountaintop experience right and then the seals can be open to you right then the the the part the Living Part like I said and don't get me I'm sorry for saying old news but that should be it that should have what that was what was working in the first church age it's like brother Dale said and you know you say well brother you're preaching does and don'ts and and brother Dale's preaching you can do what you want to yeah absolutely I told the kids one time at a youth banquet I said look I said there's a law in the books in the state of Georgia that if you drive on Georgia highways and you drink and there's a certain like 0.08 that you blow that you your alcohol content I said you're going to jail right now that laws on the books right right but if you never drank a drop in your life they can put a death penalty on that and it'll never bother you you'll never get nervous about it cuz you don't go there right it's just like that Law's not there and that's what brother Dell's preaching if you're born again some of those laws become Grace amen those laws become Grace right but not greasy Grace where we can just do anything we want to you do anything you want to then it's just like I said it it proves that you Haven had an experience yet okay why can't we and I'm going to hit everybody why can't we not have any deacons we shouldn't but God put them in the Bible for a reason cuz you knew y'all wouldn't do what the pastor says even with the Holy Ghost Peter says Paul says things hard to understand right that we wrestle to our own destruction because we can't understand what the man is talking about but you know what he never said Paul was wrong right he just said I can't understand what Paul's saying at this moment or at this time see it's how you approach God but now let's read this in First Corinthians because we got to come to a position to understand yeah the the down payment for the house or the down payment for your full Redemption excuse me was purchased at your new birth right then you got a payment book hadn't had one of them in a long time payment book get them things in the mail you start getting nervous but you know what God give you a payment book and he said um you pay you get virtue knowledge because you're paying for your house right what are you you're a temple of the Holy Ghost right you paying on your house not with money but you're paying with character because remember now brother Bram said power without character right and I think that's what's the problem right we got power without character right like I said we got a we got a knowledge on a revelation cuz if we had a revelation on the Revelation that's power with character right he said is what fit to rule rule what this guy it's not fit to Ru Donnie F Bush I I'm not that's not my that's not my property that's his property right that's you know what brother Brown said this is my eye my eye God gave it to me amen okay this is my body God gave it to me right who else gave it to you God gave it to you all right so that's what we got to be looking we got to see that that here in First Corinthians says what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own right for you are bought with a price right bought with a price comma therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit amen which are gods that doesn't say anything about the soul because it's already got your soul if you're bought if you're bought if you have a temple of the Holy Ghost all right talking about your body talking about your spirit or your character remember from now on when somebody says Spirit or talks about because see that's the spirit that dwells in man that's the character of man all right and brother brandham the the prophet of God brought it out from p Peter and said hey we got to do this before God can do other things for us all right so that's why that that power without character right is satanic right you can sit right here and be full of the devil but when you have a revelation from God Satan cannot get a revelation from God Amen he can get a knowledge on the Revelation is't that what the prophet said that's what I'm getting back to so you see what the knowledge of the Revelation does to you makes you just like I said before he High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God from such turn away right I don't hear any amens on that one amen but why are we still here we'll still he because I can't get in line I'm not worried about y'all I'm still here cuz I can't get life that's right but what do we do about it come on what we do about it it's like Dad said Sunday we had a church full Sunday there was nobody here I know it was a Memorial Day weekend but I know what some of y'all were doing don't have to have a lot of discernment when people run their mouth just sit and listen just sit and listen that's all you got to do got do just sit and listen but I want to know one thing that's more important than being right here I want to know it if it is we'll Sunday we'll go there there's nothing more important than being right here being on time being in service like I told him downstairs I said the only people that hear that buzzer downstairs is the goats the Sheep never hear it right they're either in Sunday school or up here sorry brother Dale said 15 minutes before service you need to be up here not downstairs yaking that's not me I'm just here to enforce what he said so it's not my rule it's what I said about deacons everybody thinks deacons has their own rules and it's not the pastors no brother Brown said if the pastor and the Deacon are not together you need to get rid of the deacon right in the way that get rid of the deacon right so maybe we'll see a few things change around here we'll see but we got to have a clean house if you're sitting in this room tonight and you're committing adultery you're hindering this whole church if you're sitting in this house tonight and you don't have your kids lined up me included and they live with you if you're sitting here tonight and you're not the head of your house you're hindering this church prove me wrong that's what the word says that's what the word we're going to get back to just what the word says don't this is just a filter tonight this is a filter I'm telling you what the word says I'm not telling you what my ideas this is what the word says right some of you take communion and you show up two or three times every two or three months and don't do fit washing and hey we got three ordinances that are commanded by God today right three ordinances commanded by God today and what do we do with them but a position to understand that's what I want trying to get the Sunday school class to see now that for God to be able to to use us we got to make oursel available for it right we've got to make oursel to where and we're going to read it Go aad and pull that next to the last quote this guy right here is the same guy down here amen it's just more of him to me this this is what I call this is usable Holy Spirit you not say well no no this is usable but it's the earnest right it's just one down payment all right this is the full let's read this quote here this is at the end of Statute of a perfect man brother Bram said did you ever hear this now let me tell you this and keep real put this in your listening ear see a chain is it strongest at its weakest length that's right it's no stronger than its weakest length does everybody understand what that is right you can have a chain that'll hold 2,000 lb 2,000 lb 2,000 lb 2,000 lb500 lb 2 ,000 lb 2,000 lb 2,000 lb 2,000 lb where's it going to break at about 1,600 lb this one's going to break so your Chain's no good right your chain becomes useless after that right all right that's what he's saying you this it's so it's no stronger than his weakest length no matter how strong now listen to this he's talking about the virtues no matter how strong these are built up this is built up if it's got a weak length there where she breaks and it's no stronger than the weakest length brother Brown refers to the chalkboard drawing now if you possess you say you see he said you say you say you got this this this you don't have this there's where she breaks right if you got this and haven't got that she'll break right there you got this and haven't got that it'll break this and haven't got this it'll break this and haven't got this it'll break I think he's going up the statue of a perfect man and you ain't can't have this without having this so when you surrender your complete being look what he says so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit then then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle then you read that he says then then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue and knowledge he believes the word tempers patience God his brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person I'll let that soak in a little bit you've never seen a Kinder sweeter Godly person you're sealed a seal shows on both sides see to me a seal shows on both sides like brother Claude said you got one side here one side at home yeah and if it ain't the same look how confusing it is right what gets me more than anything is for y'all y'all me included but now the kids can't say I don't come to church but for y'all to come and say oh God my kids out in the world my kids doing this my kids doing that my kids doing this my kids doing that then you don't come to church half time I don't I don't get where you don't get that right I don't get it amen how many times is brother Dale said maybe they're not here because of you right oh everybody's quiet now but I wanted what that man had I don't want his experience but I wanted the character that that man had that's what makes me who I am daddy or no Daddy I pick out that character and that's what I want to be like now do your kids say the same about you are you sitting at home with them watching television on Sunday and and then you come up here and cry and want brother Dale to save your kids maybe you ought to start saving them right right is coming from you first maybe you ought to try saving them get their haircut and make them live right if somebody lives if my kids live in my house they're going to do right right Josh I told you that's why he left a seal a seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal the same right it's not different all right there you are see when a man or woman possesses this not just thinks they have it possesses this then the Capstone then what's the Capstone the seals then the seals can be revealed right then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost right that's when it comes down that's when you get the revelation of the cap Stone which is love last quote well I got two more but they're together then Peter Still statue of a perfect man then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue seek coming up knowledge Temperance patience godl brotherly kindness add brotherly kindness and then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost come upon you comes upon you in the true baptism not that the other one's false remember the Bible says the faithful and true witness Jesus so that doesn't mean he was false now he's true no that's what this is in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost see that's where brother Ram had to come to to the true baptism of the Holy Ghost before he went on that mountain and God said this is my beloved Son hear ye him he had to come to that first and you think you and I are going to make it be any different I don't think so the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's dwelling place right last one Statue of a perfect man right in here right in here you see I got in between all these Works in here and here these little waves now they didn't put the waves on here but I saw one I don't know if if you got it or not somebody's got one where brother Brandon put waves they come down like this I've seen it one time before but that's what he's talking about cuz what he's talking about you you get this this and this and if there's a crack here something's something's going to go wrong you got to go back and fill that crack up all right but what this whole what this does is this seals didn't know what he just said it seals these in got it amen so I'll glorify it cuz you are my son right amen you're my son if you're born again you're my son you're my child child but like brother dick says I want to marry a wife not a child his wife has made herself ready all right right in here right in here you see I got in between all these Works in here and here these little waves come what is it the holy ghost coming down through Christ see the Holy Spirit see holy spirit all right so it's got to come through Christ into you cuz this Christ in you the hope of glory the holy spirit is above all this welding this together right building a what a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off what's it been done again it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven Church Messengers so he's telling you that it come down through the church ages and The Messengers but remember the Capstone was lost the Capstone Revelation was lost right Jesus was the Capstone right Jesus was the seals amen he was the whole he was the whole thing but he had to come to a place to where God could use that vessel so how are you and I going to get away with it brother bandam couldn't get away with it Paul Peter all they couldn't get away with the virtues work working in their life they couldn't get away from that you say well I'm I'm I'm just malnourished well come to church right do the things right pay your tithe pay your tithe right would you yeah thank you you heard the pastor say right pay your tithe right not just give what you think you ought to give but you know what God doesn't need your money right but he wants you to be a giver he wants you to be a giver he wants you to give that one more thing before we go the seals is the Capstone revelation of the whole thing amen right we know that but it's the Capstone revelation of the whole thing and it's going to come here on a person that has all these working in their life right it's not going to come down in half of the this is here and and you know what this don't fit down here cuz if you keep reading on a little bit further brother BR says it's a razor honed Edge and actually the Capstone has got a flange or a little lip on it right right you know how to get that lip you got to hone something yeah you got to hone it down so that lip will fit over it and then when that lip fits over it guess what it does it seals the whole thing in amen but my question tonight what's it sealing in right that's my question to you are we just going to be satisfied with the Son of God Revelation that we're born again and that we're children of God and that we're going to heaven and and uh that we're going to have a little problems down here but uh one of these days one of these days God's just going to uh like sister Anna marunga she she uh kind of was a little taken back and uh when I told told him that uh God's not coming on any certain day God don't have a day on the calendar and that he just said I'm coming right here December the 15th I'm just I'm coming whether no he's coming when he sees all of us get ready right so so there's not a day where he just you know we reading the Bible and they said he come as a thief in the night and he come this you know oh that God's got a day he's coming you know the day of the Lord he's coming no he's coming when you and I are ready but he knows that day we don't but he's not coming until his children are ready are two things are going to have to happen you're e you're either got not going to yield yourself completely to God and you're going to go by the grave remember I preached on the purging cuz you're going to be purged one way or the other death is either going to purge the old man or we're going to have it purged while we're still alive by the Capstone Revelation because you know what Jesus went through a purging time right Jesus went through death so you and I don't have to go through death amen but you know what there's a lot of there's a lot of things between here and here but the Bible says those who he has Justified he has already glorified amen now boy there that's a big that's a you could break that down and you say oh oh well that don't mean that means I don't have to do nothing yeah if you're born again you're going to die and you're going to come up Justified but you're going to have to die right anybody like that word die I don't like it but there's a chance that says we which are alive and remain we which have come who have come to a possession that's what Paul was saying right we who have come to a position we're going to be changed when the full stature of that man is standing there and God can say I've both glor glorified it when you started right and I'm going to glorify glorify it at the end am and in between is a character builder right in between as brother Keith Reed says that's Trials of life and remember whoever you let win is the one you feed the most let's stand glorify it again Lord can we shake oursel amen that if Jesus went through all that you and I are going to go through all that too amen all right father glorify thy name right he said I have both glorified it and will glorify it again right and if we take on the name Miss Jesus Christ Brother Gary he promised he'll glorify it again amen we're the only people that have the full revelation of the word I I don't that doesn't hit home if it hit home we might start shouting a little bit right cuz we are the only one brother Dane we're the only ones the only ones I I you know I was uh cutting grass at a church today and and I was telling somebody the other day there's some old Graves back in the 1800s 1889 one man died and I thought you know and I was sitting there weed eating over the grave and I I was just kind of in my spirit I said I wonder I wonder sure if I'm standing over a born again Christian yeah probably but in I you know am I standing I mean in the 1800s they don't but they what I was thinking was I thought God they never heard of a Prophet come on that's right well that's what I mean I thought Lord how many of these people are born again that's going to come up in the first resurrection that never heard a word about William brandom they knew about Jesus Christ for their day they had the word for their day and I just looked around and I saw all these families and and young kids and older ones and I you know I'm just that's just me and I'm wondering and I thought of brother dick I thought I wonder if any of these there Old Farmers way out in this church is way out in sticks I thought what some them may have on overalls you know you I don't know but back then it really didn't matter but remember what I was thinking of is they had God right sure it was a Baptist that didn't mean a thing to me before I was standing that didn't mean a thing to me 1889 there wasn't a thing called the message there actually wasn't a thing called Pentecost right so what did they have right but you know when they resurrect Jesus is going to be just as his pleased with them right just as pleased with them amen as he is with us but you know what here's the problem they can't get up without us that's right exactly that's right and that's what I was thinking brother dick walking over them Graves I thought I'm keeping these people that are born again I'm keeping these people sure I know their soul somewhere else but I'm keeping these people from taking a body chain amen because of my actions and my reactions that's what I want to think about let's sing a song 2 260 he hideth my soul let's worship him just for a little while oh wonderful saor is Jesus my Lord a wonderful savior to me he mer soul in the of the rock rivers of pleasure I see he hideth my soul in the CL of the rock that Shadows a dark thirsty land he hided my life in the depth his love and he covers me there there's the grace he covers Us with his hand there's the grace you know you and I have a memory of what went on but if it's covered under the blood God don't remember it and he won't hold it against you away behold me up and I shall not be just think about him just think about what we've been given just go sit somewhere one day and just sit down under a tree and just think of what God has given you at least the ability to hear and what we do with it much is given much is required he covers me there with his Handover father our pastor stands today Lord and he has an is in his body Lord we praise Your Great Name Lord he stood many times for many people Lord now he's standing Lord for himself and I pray Lord that you'll just touch him now you said if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover cover Lord we ask it in Jesus name that it'll happen amen amen amen as I sing it to him he hideth my soul in the CL of the rock that Shadows a dry thirsty land he hide my life in the depths love for her wonderful husband Lord that tomorrow they're going to do some test Lord and we pray Lord that as they walk in Lord and the man does his test that all will be well you said Lord for us to ask and we shall receive so we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ that our brother will be fine in Jesus name we pray and just help our sister Lord to have faith too Lord not be not be um nervous or anything Lord just with B Lord just believe for husband Lord we believe also we B our faith with in Jesus name he my soul in the of the that sh thirsty land he hideth by life in the depths of his life and he covers me there with his hand they shall recover and the name of Jesus Christ Lord what we spoken today Lord that the virtue and strength Lord that we have we give to our brother Lord and that this T will go away Lord you said it and we believe it in Jesus name amen just believe it just use it all you got to do just use it he my soul and C of the rock with r of pleasure I see he hide my soul in the CL of the rock you know he told Moses one time I swear I'll show you who where I am go stand in the Cliff of The Rock and I'll show I'll show my person in the depths of his love and he covered me there with his and he covers me there with his hand you know we were in um I told you what happened at the motel in in New Jersey and um we were in service uh that Friday night and and we had a couple people come up for prayer and and the the church is a little Pentecostal they're they're coming out of Pentecost trying to come into the message and and you know Pentecost they have to reach and grab you and slap you and throw wall all over you and you know do this and scream and shout well I told him I said brother he walked up and he he's walking you know like this walking like this and I stepped down and I said brother I said Do you believe what God said he said I do I said well the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover didn't say a thing about praying and I just reached and touched that brother on the shoulder and I said go sit down do you know what it shocked him so much he stood there cuz the prayer line we had the next night was the Pentecostal shaking and throwing and spitting and all that stuff and that's fine but can it just be an emotion the Bible didn't say that the Bible said just lay the hands on the sick and they sh it don't say pray Jerk It just said lay hands on the sick and brother Tim prayed for the same guy the next night I just don't believe he had the faith to believe what I said sorry if he was here I'd tell him cuz he's a a dear precious brother but he just couldn't get by that part of somebody trying to shake them and you know and that's okay but that's an emotion that's a workup Bible says lay hands on the seat you look at brother brandham well look at Jesus Jesus didn't scream at the Devil he said see you he said leave leave just go on leave Lazarus come forth right sure he cried with a loud voice and that's okay I believe he loved Lazarus I believe Lazarus had connection with Jesus but Jar's daughter all he done he the Bible say he just reached down got her hand by strapped your heel grabbed the hand and what just raised her from the dead he didn't have to shake her right he didn't have to work it up and that's okay but see they come through Pentecost and that's what they were looking for and I thought man get out of that try to get out of that mold of just work up and because you know what he the next night he was prayed for and they you know um brother Tim and brother Bill and him they were praying for him you know and some of the others gathered around they were you know shaking him and speaking in tongues and all that you know and that's okay that's fine but the next day the guys were still walking on the cane but if he would have just believe lay hands on the sick that's it and they shall recover right Centurion said don't even touch nothing you just speak it and whatever you say whatever you say right that's why Jesus was that character Jesus didn't have to go pray right no he didn't have to go pray did he ever when I remember when I said about Lazarus though he's prayed at L's tomb but he said this is not for me this is for y'all right a faith builder for you not for me it's telling you what I'm fixing to do but you know you say well we're we're just him we I thought we were supposed to be like Jesus amen I thought we're supposed to be like him I thought we were supposed to walk through life and not be anything important not be anything you know just live a good Christian Life That's what I said old news people this should be old news we should be speaking of the seals and a revelation of our own faith we should be speaking we should been 50 years since the prophet preached it but these virtues were alive in a group of people that never heard of William brandham right and really a lot of them never heard of the Bible a lot of them wrote it but it wasn't compiled together as a Bible it was this one wrote here and this one wrote over here James wrote over here and John wrote over here and then somebody put it together afterwards so they really weren't going I have faith in this part this this this and this no they had faith in what they had they had faith in what they had they didn't have to work it up real experience you know like well you and I you and I talked on the phone that day brother Gary had an infirmity in his body and I only said one thing what' I say you get rid of it going take it with you I see you might as well get rid of it because you ain't going he ain't going with you I was talking about any change well he caught a revelation instant Hill right then over the telephone we weren't even in the same room we were talking on the telephone he said brother I need prayer I need prayer and I could hear I could hear the the you know the the sincer in his voice and and I just you know me I'm that that may have been something I wasn't serious enough and I just said well you're not going to take it with you so you might as well get rid of it you know and and he just said well God bless you brother thank you I appreciate that it's gone it's done amen and it was something that that would have turned into something bad right I mean it could have really could have scary on the natur scary on the natural side absolutely no problem right absolutely that's what it is and that's what it is you know just pick up the phone and it's like I say with Brother Bill I want us all to pray we don't have to come up here I'm just going to lay the prayer cloth right here and before you go home if you want to lay your hands on it that'll be fine but we're going to have prayer for it and uh you say well you're getting away from the lay hands on the sick well prayer clocks are still in the Bible that's right it it it's a faith Builder and it's a contact for maybe for uh um some of us that don't have a lot of faith then we can we know that that has healed there's been a lot of healing come through the a prayer cloth right we've seen it in this church a lot of healing we've seen you guys get prayer cloth and take it somewhere else and God healing I keep one in my Bello amen all the time what for doesn't matter right whatever comes cuz you never know what's going to come but at least you you got at least you know you don't want to reach back there and start you know start rubbing on it that's Catholic no you just know that the saints of God prayed GL and this cloth had prayer over it by people that believed right amen and it was a contact a lot of people didn't even know Paul didn't even meet Paul but by Paul's character that's what I'm telling you by Paul's character they believe that whatever touched Paul right when's the last time he cut up a shirt of mine yeah brother Dale brother dicks brother Deans Brother Dean what's the difference no difference Buddy ain't no difference right I don't believe there is right I don't believe there is we live way below our privileges that's what I was thinking about today man all these people that're laying dead waiting on us Born Again Christians lived a good Christ lived a solid Christian Life and they're waiting on you and I Amen to get them out of the ground let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord tonight that something's been said Lord that'll help the people nothing's ever done Lord and just for chance it always has a meaning and a and a word behind it Lord and as we all have our heads bowed Lord from the ground that we came from we we know that we still are in these human bodies and we still have things in our in our human life that we have to deal with because of the fall and Lord Jesus our brother's laying up there in Tennessee in a hospital the devil has slipped one up on him and made his body reject something or create something that's not in there well father you're the Creator Hallelujah you're the Creator Satan is just a perverter you created all things you created that body and Lord now that body according to your word has to come under subjection to the word of God and we pray now as we pray over this prayer cloth that Lord when it touches our brother's body that he'll be made whole and there'll be a testimony Lord we still believe in you father dear Jesus forgive us of our sins or any thoughts or ideas or words that we have that we've said or spoken that are that are that are off color or bad or or or against someone father just cleanse us count that to our stupidity and our Humanity but Lord we come Lord with the blood of Jesus Christ we come with the power that you gave us at Calvary Lord when you resurrected that body that body was laying there dead and cold even a body called Lazarus that was already Lord Jesus it was stinking already that broke down and the cells were beginning to rot and father when you stood there and said Lazarus come forth creation met its creator and now Lord you've come back in the end time amen in the fullness of the word of God and through the prophet said through the full full baptism of the Holy Ghost where there's power in the blood there's power in the people and Lord don't let our power be satanic let our power have character behind it from this point forward Lord let our character show and let it show Lord for our brother that's laying there Lord that his body is not usable at this moment Lord but we know that our brother's there in his spirit and his soul and I know that he's wanting us to pray for him he's expecting prayers to come from the Saints of almighty God and Lord we've seen you do many things and we expect one more time Lord that you'll come on the scene for our brother Lord distance doesn't make any difference to you Lord but when we take that prayer cloth up there to see our precious brother Lord see him face to face Lord I pray that you'll do a work I pray that the people in this building Lord will have faith and and it'll come on their mind Lord many times during the day how our Prophet said many times we had brothers that he was quoting that maybe we didn't care much for didn't have a lot of to do with but he said when that brother gets sick or you found out that something happened to that dear brother it Mak makes you long to see that brother it makes you long to see that brother healed Lord we're all humans on this side but you've give us the Holy Ghost you've give us not just the earnest anymore you've give us the full possession and somebody's going to have to stand on this Earth with that full possession to bring those wonderful saints that we were looking at today those many headstones Lord around the world the billions that are laying in this ground that are waiting on us to come to a place we pray Lord now that our lives will be changed from this point forward amen that we'll not just do this because of dos and don'ts but that we'll see that it's a life it is the character of Jesus Christ Lord even when you were here on Earth you were in the synagogues every time that there was a feast day every time there doors were open you were there and Lord we've got to bind oursel together cuz we know Satan wants to drive a wedge but Lord we ask you in the name of Jesus Christ to take that honey like was in Sister Shepherd's dream and put that honey on the inside of that box and that'll hold water and that Waters the word and it's washing us washing us and washing us thank you Father for all things bless these people as they go home now Lord bless the continuation of this week that they'll have a wonderful time in you Lord and they'll not forget that you're their savior that you're their redeemer and that you're their healer and they're all in all Lord just be with Brother Bill I can't get him off my mind just bless him Lord touch him raise him up for your
