[7:08] weekend for all of you that were here
[7:10] amen we had a wonderful Service uh
[7:13] Saturday night and Sunday
[7:16] night and uh everything went well we had
[7:19] plenty of food sent some food home with
[7:22] brother Luis and Christine for for um
[7:26] brother Eric and his family so we we got
[7:29] fed well in the pull pit we got fed well
[7:32] downstairs so I thank you very much for
[7:34] helping to clean up put up put
[7:36] out get in and get out so everybody did
[7:40] good so so reach out take your hands
[7:42] like this do like this and
[7:45] go okay if nobody will do it for you
[7:48] Donnie did it for his sweetheart over
[7:50] here so that's wonderful but good to be
[7:52] in the house of the Lord good to be back
[7:54] uh back in the saddle if you got your
[7:56] Bibles or you we don't even do that that
[7:59] anymore we go
[8:02] to the computer so let me get this
[8:14] up 350 is where the the older generation
[8:19] can can see it okay this is the son of
[8:23] man the beginning you wow part two we're
[8:27] going to cover we're still on our son of
[8:30] man but we're we're head we're at The
[8:32] Headstone now so all this that we've
[8:35] been talking about for a year has been
[8:39] what we need to do to get to that place
[8:43] right add to your faith virtue virtue
[8:45] knowledge knowledge Temperance
[8:46] Temperance patience and then have the
[8:47] Holy Ghost mold it all together but
[8:50] let's just back up just a minute because
[8:52] we started with the baby because that
[8:55] baby was the son of man and The
[8:57] Headstone was the son of man all right
[9:00] or is the son of man so that's where I
[9:03] want to just kind of back up and go all
[9:06] the way back into eternity now because
[9:09] there's something we got to see we've
[9:11] got to see the difference in the son of
[9:13] man and the Son of God and sister CLE
[9:15] and I were talking she just the little
[9:16] comment that she makes it's always very
[9:20] powerful um she said he didn't say Jesus
[9:24] came down in Revelations 10 he said
[9:26] Christ came down it wasn't jesuses Jesus
[9:29] the body is on the right hand of the
[9:30] father Jesus the body that son of man
[9:33] part the flesh can't come down here but
[9:35] he's transferred that power to a group
[9:37] of people all right when he said all
[9:40] power in Heaven and Earth they we'll
[9:41] read it in just a minute he meant that
[9:42] but that power was then breathed into
[9:44] the
[9:46] disciples as a potential receiving of
[9:48] the Holy Ghost so that's why the Holy
[9:50] Ghost is the most powerful thing you can
[9:52] have because without the Holy Ghost
[9:54] number one you're lost number two
[9:56] without the Holy Ghost you have no power
[10:01] so it's pretty
[10:02] important to living a good Christian
[10:04] life is to have the baptism of holy
[10:05] ghost in your soul not just um not just
[10:08] on your spirit realm so remember as
[10:11] brother Ryan said this weekend coming up
[10:13] we're kind of get back to a little bit
[10:14] of normaly we'll have our prayer service
[10:16] between 5: and 6 then we'll have
[10:18] questions and answers from 6:00 to 8: I
[10:21] already have a couple but um go ahead
[10:24] and bring them if you got them remember
[10:26] brother Lise tonight he is at brother
[10:28] Martins with brother Eric and he will be
[10:30] at brother Stan prices this weekend also
[10:33] with brother Eric brother Donaldo will
[10:36] be
[10:36] here this Sunday both Services normal
[10:40] Services just like just like regular but
[10:43] he will have brother Martin's
[10:45] brother-in-law will be here interpreting
[10:47] for him because brother Luis won't be
[10:48] here so we will have an interpreter so
[10:51] remember that also at the end of the
[10:54] service we're going to have we're going
[10:55] to pray over some prayer claws to give
[10:57] for brother Dale sister Johnny called
[10:59] and requested that we all take a prayer
[11:01] cloth and put it in our Bible on Psalms
[11:04] 23 and and pray for brother
[11:08] Dell cuz he needs it and we all do and
[11:11] then brother Boyd wants some prayer clo
[11:13] to put in in the Ashley's house so we
[11:16] believe they work amen we're we're firm
[11:19] Believers and and we've got
[11:23] uh oops we better get some more I think
[11:26] I gave all them for that Louis and them
[11:28] out y'all took a bunch down there to uh
[11:30] Honduras we may have to cut some more
[11:32] but we got plenty for tonight so just
[11:34] remember that also remember February the

[11:43] night and he also will be speaking
[11:45] Sunday morning just one service so
[11:46] Brother D Scott will be with us just
[11:48] like he was last year and U pray for him
[11:51] he's having some hard times he's having
[11:53] Uh something's going on in his nervous
[11:55] system and he's he gets real weak that's
[11:57] why they weren't here Saturday Sunday
[11:59] night he preached Sunday morning he said
[12:01] he just couldn't hardly get out of the
[12:02] car uh after the service was over so
[12:04] much less come here so just remember him
[12:06] the devil would just love to put us all
[12:08] out of business but guess what we got a
[12:11] God that keeps us in business cuz he's a
[12:13] Healer and we'll we'll look at that um
[12:16] here in just a minute but we're going to
[12:18] talk about the beginning part two
[12:20] because part one we'll review a little
[12:21] bit and then start with that so let's
[12:25] bow our heads Lord thank you for this
[12:27] assembly that we have
[12:29] a good warm place that we can come Lord
[12:31] in safety and worship you father I pray
[12:33] that You' just cover each door and
[12:36] window Lord and just protect us Lord now
[12:38] from all not just
[12:40] regular um disturbances but the
[12:43] disturbances of the demons and Devils
[12:45] that are out here flying around in the
[12:47] fourth dimension I pray Lord that you'd
[12:49] rebuke them just in in your precious
[12:51] name and hold them back lord so that we
[12:53] can hear from you father so that we can
[12:55] hear straight from the logos as we're
[12:57] going to talk about tonight that that's
[12:59] where you had to come you had to bring
[13:01] that to to speech before anything could
[13:04] happen and father I pray now that as we
[13:07] speak Lord I pray that you'd heal the
[13:09] sick that you'd bless the ones Lord that
[13:11] are that are backslid Lord the ones that
[13:14] are that we haven't seen in church in in
[13:16] weeks and Lord I pray that youd just
[13:19] touch their heart Lord more than that
[13:20] touch their soul and Lord I pray that
[13:23] you'd bless each one Lord that is here
[13:25] thank you for the assembly that we have
[13:27] and the people that are here that
[13:28] assembled together under this roof and
[13:31] the support to ministry here father I
[13:32] pray that you'd be with each one be with

[13:41] you'll bless the family brother Eric and
[13:43] different ones Lord all their families
[13:45] we pray that you'd touch them Father we
[13:46] ask a special blessing tonight Lord as
[13:49] we pray over the prayer Closs at the end
[13:51] of the service Lord for our brother Dale
[13:53] Lord that you would give him Comfort
[13:55] Lord as as we see as a family we see
[13:58] that that he gets torment tormented and
[14:00] anxious about different things and
[14:02] that's just not him father and I know
[14:04] it's I know it's just the devil and he's
[14:07] trying to do what he's trying to do but
[14:08] Lord there's a greater God and we pray
[14:11] Lord in your precious name in the name
[14:13] of the Lord Jesus that you take care of
[14:14] that right now in Jesus name
[14:17] amen John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[14:20] word word was with God and the Word was
[14:22] God verse two the same was in the
[14:24] beginning with God all right so brother
[14:26] Brown said one time he said the logos
[14:28] all right the logos in the beginning was
[14:30] the logos all right so we'll cover that
[14:33] in a second all things were made by him
[14:36] all right so this is this all powerful
[14:37] guy everything's made by him there's
[14:39] nothing there's no there's no extra
[14:41] something he made everything the way
[14:42] it's supposed to be the first time all
[14:43] right and all things were made by him
[14:46] and without him was not anything made
[14:48] that was made and the Word was made
[14:50] flesh verse 14 so that word had to
[14:53] transfer down into
[14:56] something of a kinsman redeemer or
[14:58] someone that was like us cuz that's how
[15:01] we fa and we'll get to that in just a
[15:03] minute and we beheld his glory the glory
[15:05] of the only begotten of the father full
[15:06] of grace and truth you can be seated
[15:08] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[15:10] the word Isaiah 7:14 says therefore the
[15:12] Lord himself shall give you a sign
[15:15] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[15:17] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[15:20] now let's go to that that little spot of
[15:23] Jerusalem just for a moment and let's
[15:25] look at Mary as she walks as brother R
[15:27] tells she walks to the water with a
[15:29] water pot she goes and gets water and
[15:30] she's thinking on the Lord and she
[15:32] different things and what happen she
[15:34] didn't just all of a sudden up and say
[15:36] I'm
[15:37] pregnant right there had to be something
[15:41] brought to her there had to be a
[15:45] message amen there had to be a message
[15:48] Gabriel had to come with a message speak
[15:51] that message and then she had to accept
[15:53] that what that person said that she'd
[15:56] never seen before in her life amen uh I
[15:59] would say maybe he just appeared and
[16:01] there he
[16:03] was behold Mary you've been highly
[16:07] favored and she's like who's this
[16:09] guy but she pondered it in her
[16:13] heart in her soul in her being and she
[16:17] said well if that's what it says and I
[16:19] can read where the scripture and Isaiah
[16:20] says that brother Brown said you know
[16:22] him her and Joseph may have been reading
[16:24] that same scripture says Behold a virgin
[16:26] shall conceive and and his brother there
[16:28] there was many many virgins back there
[16:30] in that time why I was married well she
[16:32] was the one that was that was going to
[16:34] receive it without any doubt in her
[16:37] heart all right now she pondered it and
[16:39] she also she may had doubt later but at
[16:41] that time something dropped down and
[16:44] Gabriel was bringing a message from
[16:47] God that wasn't Gabriel's
[16:50] message he was a
[16:52] deliverer he he delivered the message
[16:55] all right thereby with me that was God
[16:58] speaking into her there only one person
[16:59] can create and that's God all right but
[17:02] he sent Gabriel on a mission knowing
[17:05] that Gabriel was the spokesman to the
[17:07] Jews right Ain that what he said he was
[17:09] a spokesman to the Jews so maybe even
[17:11] Mary kind of felt comfortable when he
[17:13] says hey I'm Gabriel I've been sent from
[17:16] I've been sent from God and I've give
[17:17] you this this this uh opportunity to
[17:20] fulfill the the scripture and she just
[17:22] says what be it unto me according to Thy
[17:24] word all right she didn't have to do
[17:26] anything else she just said hey I'll
[17:29] accept it if you're bringing the message
[17:31] so that's what we got to see when the
[17:32] when we see a a minister or someone
[17:36] speak we've got to get the humanity part
[17:39] out of it because if the logos is
[17:42] bringing us a message if that speech is
[17:44] bringing us a message and it comes from
[17:47] God it cannot be wrong right now I can
[17:53] have my ideas and you can have yours
[17:55] they're like noses we all got them right
[17:59] but if something drops down and we get
[18:01] into a key or we get into a a slot and
[18:05] and we call it the anointing or but you
[18:07] can be anointed by the
[18:08] devil but when you but when that logos
[18:11] that was in the beginning when he starts
[18:13] speaking his word see that's what
[18:16] happened in the life of William brandham
[18:19] we understand that he was a a mortal
[18:21] human being a a common man just like the
[18:25] rest of us uh couldn't speak a very good
[18:27] language didn't have a very good
[18:30] education that would have just gotten
[18:32] his
[18:32] way but when he stepped in that pull pit
[18:35] it was so much God speaking to us that
[18:39] one day on the tape it says this is not
[18:41] William brandom you're
[18:43] hearing right right and he didn't change
[18:45] the pitch of his voice either he didn't
[18:48] say I'm God no he just kept right on
[18:50] talking just like brother randam he just
[18:52] like it just it was him but God had took
[18:55] over his vocal cords and was speaking
[18:57] through
[18:59] him to
[19:00] us and that's why we call it the voice
[19:03] of God recording cuz it was the voice of
[19:05] God it had to come through somebody
[19:06] though my point is why didn't God just
[19:09] come down and say
[19:10] Mary he sent a
[19:12] messenger he sent a messenger that was
[19:16] comfortable and I'll explain something
[19:18] to you later God couldn't see Mary face
[19:20] to face
[19:22] right God couldn't come down himself he
[19:24] had to send a
[19:25] messenger cuz remember we'll read in
[19:27] just few minutes where he told Moses he
[19:29] said Moses you can't see my face and
[19:31] live why there was no Holy Ghost Inside
[19:34] of the people to reflect
[19:38] back cuz we see him face to face is what
[19:40] the Bible says we can do that we can see
[19:44] God no man has seen God at any time but
[19:47] what we see him through the Lord Jesus
[19:49] Christ to Matthew 1 ver8 now the birth
[19:52] of Jesus was on his wives when his
[19:54] mother Mary his his mother Mary was
[19:56] spouse to Joseph before before they came
[19:58] together she was found with child of the
[20:01] Holy Ghost all that scene that I told
[20:02] you a few minutes
[20:03] ago now all these things was done and it
[20:06] might be fulfilled which was spoken of
[20:07] the Lord by the prophet saying behold
[20:08] the Virgin shall be with child so
[20:10] they're going back to the Old Testament
[20:12] and shall bring forth a son and they
[20:13] shall call his name Emmanuel which being
[20:15] interpreted is god with us and that's
[20:18] what it was it was God with us but now
[20:21] remember we going we're going to
[20:23] separate the two people just really
[20:25] quick tonight with Adam Adam was a Son
[20:28] of God but Adam was not born like you
[20:31] and I everybody with me um mecdc was not
[20:34] born like me and you but yet that it was
[20:37] God with a filtered listen a filtered
[20:40] voice a human voice that spoke to
[20:43] Abraham and told him the what the
[20:46] truth
[20:47] right now the problem with with us is I
[20:51] say all of us even down Through the Ages
[20:55] that filter we didn't allow God to to
[20:58] speak what he wanted to speak man got
[21:01] involved the devil got involved I'm
[21:04] going to read it to you in a few minutes
[21:05] where brother R said the father son Holy
[21:06] Ghost baptism come from the pits of hell
[21:09] it was hatched out of hell that's pretty
[21:13] rugged but that's exactly what happened
[21:15] listen anything contrary to the logos of
[21:18] God is from
[21:21] Hell anything that's why God had to send
[21:25] a prophet in the end time to tie the
[21:26] loose ends up to bring everything back
[21:29] to where it was supposed to
[21:32] be and then open the seals am which was
[21:36] God himself talking to us amen through a
[21:38] human body Colossians 1:12 says giving
[21:41] thanks un the father now watch how Paul
[21:43] brings this down giving thanks unto the
[21:46] Father which ha made us meat to be
[21:48] partakers of the inheritance of the
[21:50] Saints in light all right not Darkness
[21:53] but light who ha delivered us from the
[21:56] power of darkness in other words if you
[21:57] have the baptis the Holy Ghost today you
[21:59] have been delivered from the power of
[22:00] Darkness the power of Darkness may want
[22:02] to get inside of you but it cannot get
[22:04] in your soul all right it can Cloud your
[22:07] mind it can make you go crazy but it
[22:09] cannot if you're born again in your soul
[22:12] it
[22:13] cannot change
[22:15] you then you'd be changing
[22:20] God cuz you can't have a soul that wants
[22:22] to come to church that wants to forget
[22:24] all the stuff and read and study and God
[22:26] speak to them and all of a sudden you
[22:27] don't have that anymore
[22:28] more that's not God he's not an Indian
[22:31] giver he gives you the baptism of the
[22:33] Holy Ghost he's pleased to dwell in you
[22:34] and he's got a he's got something for
[22:37] you right there for you not the guy
[22:40] sitting beside of you the lady sitting
[22:41] beside of you your mother your father
[22:43] even the preacher he's got something for
[22:45] you cuz he's going to give you a part of
[22:48] himself all right and God don't have to
[22:51] do that remember he's self-existing he
[22:54] doesn't need all this but he wants it
[22:57] amen there's something inside of him
[22:59] that compels him to have children that
[23:02] compels him to be a savior A Healer a
[23:04] redeemer all those compound names of
[23:06] Jehovah that we we see that we know now
[23:09] every one of them was wrapped up in one
[23:11] man called Jesus Christ and I'll read it
[23:13] to you right here and whom we have
[23:15] Redemption who ha delivered us from the
[23:17] power of Darkness translated us into the
[23:20] Kingdom look of his dear son Jesus our
[23:24] dear
[23:25] son in whom we have Redemption through
[23:28] his
[23:29] blood all right even the Forgiveness of
[23:33] sins who is the image of the invisible
[23:37] God the fir look the first
[23:40] born of every creature remember we we
[23:44] read Revelations 3:14 that's what we get
[23:46] in the end time we get the beginning and
[23:48] I'll read it in a minute 3:14 that's
[23:50] what we get in the end time we get the
[23:51] beginning and I'll read it in a minute
[23:53] the beginning the firstborn the the
[23:54] beginning of the creation of God see
[23:57] that's the unique part of this church
[23:59] age the unique part of this age is we
[24:01] get it the way it's supposed to have
[24:02] been right praise the Lord ought to make
[24:06] you happy that's what we get we get that
[24:09] part right for by him were all things
[24:13] created Now watch how Paul brings this
[24:15] that are in heaven and that are in Earth
[24:17] visible and invisible Thrones
[24:19] principalities Powers all things were
[24:22] created by Him and for
[24:25] him and he is before all things and by
[24:29] him all things consist now keep that in
[24:32] your mind cuz we're going to talk about
[24:33] something in just a second and he is the
[24:35] head of the body Now watch how Paul
[24:36] brings you right back
[24:38] down he's the head of the body of the
[24:40] church or the bride who is the beginning
[24:43] the firstborn from the dead hey Jesus
[24:47] did die right God didn't but Jesus did
[24:51] that's what made him our brother that's
[24:53] what made the connection between us and
[24:56] God that in all things he might have the
[24:58] prence now what for it pleased the
[25:01] father that in him should all fullness
[25:06] dwell and you see where I said not in
[25:08] Adam Adam was not the fullness of the
[25:11] godhead bodily Adam was a being that was
[25:14] created and then the breath of eternal
[25:15] life a part of God was put in him but he
[25:17] did not have these compound names he did
[25:20] not have this he did not have this
[25:22] desire that God
[25:25] had right he had desire sure
[25:28] he named all the animals he was God of
[25:29] the earth he did all this he did that
[25:31] but remember he
[25:33] fell right he's the one that took us
[25:36] down not
[25:37] Eve Eve did what she did but Adam's the
[25:40] one that sold us
[25:42] out
[25:44] amen but Adam couldn't see Adam thought
[25:46] he could save Eve went out to get her
[25:50] and couldn't get back in
[25:51] himself now listen this man that created
[25:54] all things and before all things and by
[25:56] all things consist he he
[25:58] could praise God he could he was the son
[26:02] of man Adam was the son of God he was
[26:05] the son of man Genesis 2:7 said the Lord
[26:09] God formed man of the Dust of the ground
[26:11] and look and breathed into his nostrils
[26:13] the breath of life and Man became a
[26:15] living Soul now we know one thing's for
[26:18] sure we'll read it in a minute animals
[26:21] don't have
[26:24] soul right we do we have we have a a
[26:29] free will to to make better
[26:33] stuff but they
[26:35] don't John
[26:37] 20:21 then Jesus said unto them peace be
[26:40] unto you as my father has sent me now
[26:43] look as the father has sent me what was
[26:46] he the fullness of the godhead Bly he
[26:49] was everything in bottled up inside of
[26:51] that one man there was not another man
[26:53] anywhere that had anything in like he
[26:56] did I'm going to send to
[26:59] you and when he had said this he
[27:02] breathed on them now watch this word
[27:06] breathed is the same over here where he
[27:08] breathed on
[27:10] Adam because it's the same holy
[27:13] ghost He breathed on them and said unto
[27:16] them receive ye the Holy Ghost now we
[27:19] know brother Bram told us and thank God
[27:21] for a Propet because there aren't people
[27:23] that believe that right then they receed
[27:24] the Holy Ghost you can't receive the
[27:25] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was
[27:27] standing there talking to him the
[27:29] dispensation had not changed they had to
[27:31] go to Penta they had to go to Pentecost
[27:34] they had to go to the Jubilee to get a
[27:36] release of that life that was in Jesus
[27:38] to release into the people but it was a
[27:42] potential that was telling them you can
[27:43] do it and I'm going to do it I'm going
[27:46] to do it I'm going to release the Holy
[27:48] Ghost and you're going to receive it
[27:51] remember he said go to Jerusalem you'll
[27:52] receive what power or dunamus from on
[27:55] high but that was a promise brother BR
[27:58] said before he left the Earth he made
[28:01] sure somebody was going to believe him
[28:05] he made sure there was a group of people
[28:07] that when they went to the upper room
[28:09] they said this is
[28:11] that Peter said this is that cuz he was
[28:13] standing there or maybe sitting there
[28:15] when when Jesus said receive ye the Holy
[28:18] Ghost they didn't forget
[28:21] that whosoever sends you remit now whoa
[28:24] hang on a minute that's just a little
[28:26] bit too much p there brother
[28:29] now I'm going to read you this red
[28:31] letter it's not what I put in here it's
[28:33] red letter cuz that's what Jesus said
[28:36] whosoever sins you remit they are
[28:38] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[28:40] you retain they are
[28:44] retained Blasphemous names brother R
[28:46] says look the church is the mystical
[28:48] Body of Christ born of the Breath of
[28:52] God oh did you get it congregation says
[28:55] amen the Church of God is born of a
[28:57] breath of the Breath of God God breathed
[29:01] breath into the nostrils look
[29:03] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[29:06] living Soul now
[29:07] remember Adam was a living
[29:10] being God had already given him life
[29:13] right cuz you watch what I'm going to
[29:15] tell
[29:16] you and he became a living Soul now
[29:19] watch did you know the Pentecostals or
[29:22] the true Pentecostal church is born of
[29:25] the Breath of God now if he put those
[29:27] two together listen to me if he put
[29:29] those two together those Pentecostal
[29:31] people when they were born babies they
[29:34] didn't have the Holy Ghost they had to
[29:36] receive it everybody with me they had to
[29:39] receive it so Adam had to receive
[29:40] eternal life he just wasn't born with it
[29:43] amen amen all right so let's look at
[29:46] what happened here this this word logos
[29:48] don't get so caught up with it but it is
[29:51] it is terminology that God wanted to use
[29:53] so we're going to use it if God wanted
[29:56] to use it then we're going to use it all
[29:57] right so that word logos is the simple
[30:00] definition it's the appeal to logic now
[30:03] how do you appeal to logic you got to
[30:05] talk to somebody right right
[30:10] speech you can think of things all you
[30:12] want to but if you keep it in your head
[30:14] it's not going to come to
[30:19] fruition means to appeal to the
[30:21] audience's sense of reason or
[30:25] Logic the whole
[30:28] the whole Bible seems illogical to most
[30:32] people cuz they haven't heard the logos
[30:34] of the Bible right amen they see the
[30:37] letter of it how can a virgin conceive
[30:40] how can this man you call God die how
[30:43] can this man you call God come back on
[30:45] the day of Pentecost how can this man
[30:47] they're not listening to the logos
[30:49] they're listening to just
[30:52] speech but this lust is the power behind
[30:56] it is God amen and listen it can't be
[31:00] changed it cannot be changed nothing in
[31:03] this Bible can be changed so when he
[31:05] stood and said in the beginning was the
[31:06] word the word was with God and the Word
[31:07] was God and that word was made flesh
[31:09] that's the way it was going to be but
[31:11] you go back to Genesis 1 said God
[31:12] created God
[31:15] spoke and it came to fruition even
[31:18] brother Ram said it was a thought once a
[31:19] thought is spoken it's
[31:21] expressed and with God whatever he
[31:24] thinks is going to come to pass praise
[31:26] God I'm glad we're not that
[31:31] way think about it just for about 5
[31:33] seconds while I scroll this up
[31:37] here cuz all the stuff you think all day
[31:41] long that's what I thought to use logos
[31:45] the author look makes clear logical
[31:48] connections between ideas and includes
[31:50] the use of facts and
[31:53] statistics as we read the Bible we look
[31:56] and like I said before
[31:57] God's not a very good mathematician cuz
[31:59] he can do with one what we can't do with
[32:01] 10 million all right he can do with one
[32:03] person so he he's not into big numbers
[32:06] but he is into the power behind the
[32:09] number logos or the appeal to logic
[32:11] means to appeal to the audience's sense
[32:13] of reason or logic to use logos the
[32:15] author makes clear logical connection
[32:18] between ideas and includes use of facts
[32:20] and statistics using historical and
[32:22] literal analogies to make a logical
[32:25] argument is another strategy there
[32:27] should be no holes in the argument as
[32:29] known as logical fallacies listen God
[32:32] has no logical
[32:35] fallacies but when they began to start
[32:38] re man began to start
[32:42] arguing about one God versus
[32:45] three father son Holy Ghost baptism
[32:48] versus the Lord Jesus
[32:51] Christ they
[32:53] analyzed the
[32:55] word but but they didn't hear from the
[32:58] logos of the word that's right they
[33:00] heard from the devil that got so close
[33:02] to the
[33:03] logos amen till it sounded just like him
[33:06] that's right
[33:08] right but there's no holes in the word
[33:10] of God God is in continuity everything
[33:12] is in continuity with God but we got to
[33:15] remember though that brother R talks
[33:17] about Loose Ends what was loose ends
[33:18] that means that something got
[33:21] cut the word of God got cut it got cut
[33:24] down diluted watered down that's right
[33:27] there should be no holes in the argument
[33:29] as known as logical fallacies which are
[33:31] unclear or wrong assumptions or
[33:33] connections between ideas that's what
[33:35] all false Doctrine
[33:37] is amen it's somewhere it disconnects
[33:40] you from God somewhere a false doct will
[33:43] take you to a person not to God amen
[33:46] amen so that speech had to become a a
[33:51] form cuz they had to have something to
[33:53] speak through because remember we were
[33:54] made in the image of God we weren't just
[33:56] a cloud we weren't just a a floating uh
[33:59] Casper the Friendly Ghost type thing
[34:01] right so there was a body that was
[34:03] standing a theany body that he stepped
[34:07] into that he could use to speak to me
[34:09] and you now remember brother randam
[34:12] calls him in one place King theophany so
[34:15] he's the king of all theophanies any
[34:17] theophany that's ever was or will be he
[34:20] had it in
[34:21] him everybody with me Satan can't make
[34:25] one he can pervert one one but he can't
[34:28] make one all right only God can make
[34:30] remember he created all
[34:33] things and it's a noun and it's a
[34:35] visible visible manifestation of a deity
[34:38] so then you got something to look
[34:40] at but remember God is always hid
[34:43] himself behind
[34:46] something after the fall now before the
[34:48] fall I believe Adam it never was
[34:50] recorded that Adam and God couldn't talk
[34:52] to each
[34:53] other face to face brother Bri and say
[34:56] come down and say hey buddy how you
[34:57] doing hey hey children how y'all doing
[34:59] today there was no problem before the
[35:01] fall there's not going to be any problem
[35:03] after the
[35:05] fall listen you're not going to hide
[35:07] your face from God maybe right now today
[35:09] you might hide your face from God for
[35:10] something maybe you did in humanity but
[35:13] when we get over there we're not going
[35:14] to be hiding from God in a new
[35:16] city we're not going to be hiding from
[35:19] him there know where to
[35:22] go but it's a visible man visible
[35:26] manifest of a deity so God had to come
[35:29] down so that we can understand him he
[35:30] had to come into a form then he had to
[35:33] speak something that we could understand
[35:35] remember the Bible if it's written to
[35:37] where you say I can't understand that
[35:39] then that's your
[35:40] problem right right I say that not not
[35:44] not saying it to be mean but that's your
[35:46] problem because God wrote it so that
[35:47] everybody can understand it if it is
[35:50] articulated
[35:53] right right through a filter
[35:58] thank you okay a theophany is the
[36:01] combination of two Greek words Theos
[36:03] which is God and Phan which is to appear
[36:06] so a theophany then is an appearance of
[36:09] God to human beings right now theophany
[36:13] is typically for the purpose of
[36:15] revealing something about the character
[36:18] of
[36:20] God you know how God's character is
[36:24] revealed through you amen
[36:27] King theophany gave you
[36:32] one that's the
[36:34] soul then you have a
[36:36] choice whether to follow on and receive
[36:40] him or to let that theophany stay
[36:44] black and you die and you go to hell or
[36:48] you go to judgment let's say go to
[36:50] judgment the term itself does not appear
[36:52] in scripture but the concept appears
[36:54] throughout even theologians will tell
[36:56] you even you look at Scofield brother
[36:58] Brown didn't come up with these words
[36:59] logos and theophany he read it in the
[37:02] Bible he read it in the commentary of
[37:04] Scofield in different ones where they
[37:06] would there had to be some explanation
[37:08] of God coming from this great big thing
[37:10] that you can't understand down to where
[37:12] you can hear him speak and you can see
[37:14] that he's standing there in eternity and
[37:16] then when he becomes Jesus Christ it's
[37:18] the same
[37:20] guy it's not a different
[37:23] person now in the trinitarian doctrine
[37:25] that's a different person
[37:27] no that's God if he was the fullness of
[37:30] the godhead bodily where was anything
[37:34] else brother bar said the deity of Jesus
[37:37] Christ I love this CU this is
[37:40] 1949 like someone was speaking the other
[37:42] day he said God what was he when he was
[37:45] back under millions and millions of year
[37:47] ago when he was no just like this space
[37:50] here and then he gathered up into the
[37:52] logos he gathered it up and said I've
[37:54] got to be this form
[37:57] so that Humanity will understand because
[37:59] remember before he began he knew the
[38:02] end he knew who wouldn't who wouldn't
[38:05] understand him he knew he had to make it
[38:07] where some of us dummies can understand
[38:11] it then he came from the lust down into
[38:15] Christ remember that's not Jesus Christ
[38:18] that's Christ right the anointing Jesus
[38:22] Christ was the anointed
[38:24] Messiah he got an Earthly name of Jesus
[38:28] the flesh body that he
[38:30] inhabited so that we can call that
[38:33] connection to the father is through
[38:36] Jesus Christ now Paul picks that up many
[38:38] many times the only connection we have
[38:40] to the father is through Jesus Christ no
[38:42] man seing God at any time but the what
[38:44] the son has declared
[38:47] him now as the son declared him though
[38:49] what did he do he transferred that to me
[38:50] and you to declare him for us to declare
[38:53] him right here
[38:55] today
[38:57] see it's just God coming down like this
[38:59] to the Earth then going right back into
[39:02] God again Jesus stood and we read it on
[39:05] the the um communion scripture he says
[39:09] he knew that he had come from God and he
[39:10] was going back to God he had a clear
[39:13] understanding maybe when he was 13 or 10
[39:15] or 12 or 9 or six or every how maybe he
[39:17] didn't have a clear understanding you
[39:18] say well yeah he had to have a human
[39:20] brain like me and you did the Bible said
[39:21] he grew in Grace and knowledge and he
[39:24] became perfect this thing
[39:27] don't you see what I mean just revolving
[39:29] coming down from space from eternity
[39:32] rolling together coming down into the
[39:34] logos and the logos down into the
[39:38] man then returning back again for one
[39:43] purpose to redeem that man that
[39:49] fell he didn't come down like many would
[39:52] say as brother R tells us he he well I'm
[39:55] I'm just going to feel sorry for him I'm
[39:56] just going to go down there Earth and
[39:58] I'm going to just see who will feel
[39:59] sorry for me and get saved no he came to
[40:02] get the ones that heau wanted
[40:04] him before the foundation of the
[40:07] world now that's what he came for to be
[40:10] a redeemer and before God could be a
[40:12] redeemer he had to be according to the
[40:15] law a kinsman redeemer in other words he
[40:17] was born the same way you were but
[40:21] without sex all right he he had to be
[40:24] birthed he was birthed to a birth canal
[40:26] water broke blood came out uh umbilical
[40:29] cord was hung on him and that's
[40:30] something Adam didn't
[40:32] have right so Adam couldn't be our
[40:36] brother Adam was
[40:38] different created full grown you and I
[40:42] some of us that our age are not full
[40:44] grown well praise the Lord anyhow he had
[40:47] to be K folk to us so 1951 resurrection
[40:51] of
[40:52] Lazarus there's where science get mixed
[40:54] up they say no he might give me my hand
[40:56] like a monkey and face like a chimpanzee
[40:58] might give him a foot like a bear but
[41:00] God put a soul in a
[41:03] man that listen now look this white
[41:06] cloud deity came down not in the animal
[41:09] in man and now if they want to go back
[41:13] and dig up some old bones let them dig
[41:14] up as many as they want to fossils and
[41:17] doesn't have a thing to do in the
[41:18] bearing of the word of God there he is
[41:22] then here's this man and now the man
[41:25] sinned all right talking about Adam and
[41:28] when he sinned and fell then that little
[41:31] cloud in there became
[41:32] marred and
[41:36] black right the only problem with Adam
[41:39] was is he didn't have a chance to go
[41:40] back right he lost it because he had a
[41:46] position right you understand what I'm
[41:48] saying he couldn't go back and get
[41:50] saved and clear all that out no that had
[41:53] to stay with
[41:55] him
[41:57] all right you'll see a little something
[41:59] there then the lo you see how important
[42:01] me you
[42:03] are you important me and you are we get
[42:05] a choice we were born in sin shape of
[42:08] iniquity dying on our way to hell and we
[42:10] had a choice to get
[42:13] back then the Loos came down and was
[42:16] made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem
[42:18] this man back to the love of the father
[42:22] and he came in by the baptism of the
[42:23] Holy Spirit and chased sin now praise
[42:26] the Lord Chase sin out of the
[42:29] human and brings him back again again in
[42:32] fellowship with
[42:34] God everybody with me so now look
[42:37] questions and answers on Genesis
[42:40] 1953 now if God created man his own
[42:42] image and his own likeness then he
[42:44] wasn't a cloud he was a tree he wasn't a
[42:46] dog he wasn't a cat he was a human he
[42:48] was a
[42:49] man what kind of man did he create now
[42:51] look a spirit man so there we come from
[42:54] we come from logos
[42:56] to theophany a a a word formed body a
[42:59] body that
[43:00] formed the Loos could speak through and
[43:03] we can understand him because he said
[43:05] you're going to be made in my
[43:06] image whatever I'm fixing to make all
[43:09] right whatever I'm fixing to bring onto
[43:11] the Earth it's going to look like me
[43:14] right
[43:18] right see that's where we are
[43:22] different because in our Humanity we
[43:25] were made from different seed and
[43:26] different cells and different you
[43:28] understand what I'm saying we come from
[43:30] different
[43:30] lineages all right so that had to be
[43:33] what done away with and brought us into
[43:35] a new
[43:36] creation
[43:38] right he made all the creation and
[43:40] created a spirit man the close reading
[43:42] of this now to the one that asked the
[43:44] question will find this that God gave
[43:46] Dominion of the cattle and the fishes
[43:48] and everything to the man but in his
[43:50] making up there he made him in his own
[43:52] image what to lead the cattle lead the
[43:55] Beast of the the field just like the
[43:56] Holy Spirit leads the believer
[43:59] today Here's my
[44:01] thought remember
[44:04] Adam Adam was formed in Genesis 2:7 out
[44:08] of the ground the the flesh body of Adam
[44:12] was in Genesis
[44:14] 2:7 before that though in Genesis 1:26
[44:18] something came out of
[44:21] God come on something came out of God to
[44:25] lead the animal
[44:27] So Adam Walked In the Garden of Eden in
[44:29] his theophany
[44:31] first can you believe that he walked in
[44:34] his the AL because that's if it's not
[44:37] there's two three different people
[44:38] running around here right right cuz out
[44:41] of him he made this in his own image he
[44:44] said here you take over the Earth I'll
[44:47] take over heaven I'm going to put part
[44:50] of me inside of you cuz remember Adam
[44:52] wasn't the
[44:53] fullness it wasn't time for the fullness
[44:56] to show
[44:58] up just like the Holy Spirit look leads
[45:00] the believer
[45:02] today he was in other words look Adam
[45:05] the first man in the lower creations of
[45:08] God the first creation was God himself
[45:11] what
[45:12] logos
[45:14] theophany we can see somebody standing
[45:16] there his name is not God but he is God
[45:21] remember God's not a name God's an
[45:24] object of worship the and out of God
[45:26] came to logos which was what the Son of
[45:29] God the Bible calls Adam the Son of
[45:33] God everybody with me I'm reading
[45:36] Bible then out of God comes a logos
[45:38] which was the son of God so there was a
[45:40] part of God went out look then out of
[45:42] the logos which was the word in the
[45:44] beginning was the word word was with God
[45:46] the Word was God and the Word was made
[45:49] flesh out of the Loos comes forth the
[45:54] man okay
[45:57] cuz let me give you a little
[46:01] background what are they in in the sixth
[46:03] Dimension right
[46:04] now flesh
[46:06] bodies flesh bodies still here because
[46:09] of sin it can't go through there's a
[46:11] Chasm there's a gulf there's something
[46:14] fixed that that human body can't get
[46:16] there so it has to stay here so what
[46:20] happened their
[46:24] theophonic mention and just as alive and
[46:28] got eyes and got ears and got nose and
[46:30] got mouth cuz they're praising God
[46:32] remember they saw brother brandom and
[46:34] they were hugging him saying my precious
[46:36] brother that was their
[46:39] theophany but now remember the ones in
[46:42] the Fifth Dimension they're in their
[46:44] theophanies too right cuz we all got one
[46:48] that's right that's where our choice
[46:49] comes from a deer doesn't have a
[46:52] theophany a deer has Spirit right when
[46:55] we take an animal or animal gets hit it
[46:58] that that that life just disappears and
[47:01] goes back into God right cuz a deer is
[47:05] not an
[47:06] individual you're an individual though
[47:08] so whatever happens to you it's got to
[47:09] go one place or the other you're either
[47:11] here now or somebody's in that Dimension
[47:14] five and that Dimension
[47:17] six everybody with me on that it's
[47:19] pretty simple You're Building whatever
[47:21] you are now you're Building inside of
[47:24] you amen your
[47:28] future you're building your future
[47:30] either your future's going to be over
[47:31] there in The Fifth Dimension or your
[47:33] future's going to be in the sixth
[47:34] Dimension can't be in both got to be in
[47:37] one or the
[47:38] other all right now look
[47:41] watch but when he died he rose again and
[47:44] come up the Bible said no one has
[47:46] ascended up but he that came down first
[47:49] when he was in heaven he was the lust
[47:52] that went out of God in the beginning
[47:54] all right what's that that's the
[47:57] Christ remember he got the name Jesus
[48:01] 2,000 years ago before that he had
[48:04] titles cuz they didn't know what to call
[48:06] him they called him they knew he was a
[48:08] great God they so they called him
[48:10] yahovah or Jehovah Jehovah God something
[48:14] above us something that that told us
[48:17] what to do and if we didn't do it you
[48:19] know we suffer the consequences
[48:21] everybody with me
[48:22] right but then remember brother BR said
[48:25] I I used to think God hated me and Jesus
[48:27] loved me come to find out that great
[48:30] Jehovah just Whirled itself down into a
[48:33] human and he walked into this world and
[48:36] projected
[48:38] love but remember if you don't accept
[48:41] him you get the Judgment part right but
[48:46] he came down here and was judged for
[48:49] me oh don't ever forget what happened on
[48:52] that cross we can talk about seals and
[48:53] Bs and plagues and all that stuff don't
[48:55] ever forget what happened at Calvary
[48:58] that theophany was hanging
[49:00] there inside of that flesh
[49:03] man and he was saying oh let me out I
[49:08] got work to do am so it's theop he went
[49:11] where went to
[49:14] hell uh Satan must have knew who he
[49:17] was uh Abraham must to knew who he was
[49:21] remember brother brand say he come back
[49:22] up to Paradise knocked on the door and
[49:24] open the door and Abraham said hey
[49:25] that's guy we fed the calf to Ezekiel
[49:28] said I saw him as a wheel in the middle
[49:30] of a wheel he he had he had fire from
[49:33] here down and fire from here up everyone
[49:35] knew him in assemble
[49:37] form right right but he was getting
[49:40] ready oh come on somebody he was getting
[49:43] ready to make it
[49:45] real he was getting ready to make it so
[49:47] real that on the day of Pentecost those
[49:48] people became little
[49:50] jesuses and they had that lust that
[49:53] speech there's no way Paul could
[49:57] could bring us 80% of the Bible that we
[50:00] say God wrote without the logos taking
[50:02] over and
[50:06] speaking same with Peter James
[50:09] John we we use Paul because obviously he
[50:12] wrote the most of the of the New
[50:14] Testament and with a lot better
[50:16] understanding than the rest of them but
[50:19] now look he came on Earth and was not to
[50:21] be made an
[50:23] angel he came down on Earth and took the
[50:25] form of abolishment now we're seeing
[50:26] Angel is not a flesh
[50:28] person right right Angel's a spirit
[50:31] stays a spirit now they may come and
[50:33] inhabit a
[50:35] body cause you to do things or first one
[50:38] thing and another but I'm just like you
[50:40] said before here's Joshua Joshua's out
[50:43] there fighting his fighting his uh his
[50:46] his I mean he probably was so tired he
[50:49] couldn't move he comes out to battle and
[50:52] he walks over a hill and he sees a guy
[50:54] standing looks like he' never lost the
[50:57] battle in his
[50:58] life fully array in his armor though
[51:02] because David saw him as a I mean Joshua
[51:05] saw him as a very formidable
[51:07] opponent he said are you for us or
[51:09] against
[51:10] us when Joshua heard that
[51:13] voice that voice said oh I I'm here to
[51:17] take over I I'm the captain of the host
[51:19] you don't have to worry about it Joshua
[51:21] I'm with you but while you at it it's
[51:23] kind of you're on Holy Ground how about
[51:25] taking you shoes off like Moses
[51:28] did how much reverence should we
[51:32] have when God Appears to
[51:35] us he came down on Earth and took the
[51:37] form of a bondsman not an angel he
[51:40] didn't come down in the great Jehovah
[51:42] Glory but he came down as a man to
[51:44] redeem man to die for man to die as a
[51:47] man he never died as God remember God
[51:49] can't die and we agree with that you
[51:52] can't
[51:53] die the real you can't die
[51:57] he died as a man the sin of man was upon
[52:00] the son of
[52:02] man why because that's our kin folk
[52:06] right amen and he had to become a man in
[52:09] order to pay the
[52:10] penalty what did he do the Bible said he
[52:12] was made a little lower than the angels
[52:14] in order for death that he might take
[52:16] away and abolish sin and take away
[52:18] sickness from the world now when he came
[52:20] down from the highest look lust from God
[52:23] he came down through Ang angs came down
[52:26] and was made a man he said I am not even
[52:28] a man I'm a worm brother Luis preached
[52:31] about that several months ago I am a
[52:33] worm and no man for he was despised and
[52:36] rejected but he was God Almighty hidden
[52:40] in human flesh now here's a statement I
[52:42] love brother brandham here's
[52:44] 1957 I believe that Jesus is the son of
[52:47] God I believe that in his body he was a
[52:50] man he was born of a woman just like I
[52:53] was but his blood was was not of a woman
[52:57] it was of God and Jehovah God look
[52:59] Jehovah God the Loos who brewed it over
[53:03] the Earth and brewed the first man Out
[53:06] of the Dust of the earth overshadowed
[53:08] Mary see listen Gabriel didn't give her
[53:11] that
[53:13] seed Gabriel can't
[53:15] create God gave the seed and the and the
[53:19] um and the Egg
[53:21] okay but she had to hear it from a
[53:26] messenger that's right that's why we
[53:28] need a five-fold Ministry yes sir to
[53:30] break the word down to get us to realize
[53:32] don't I don't want you believe me
[53:34] believe what I
[53:35] say we were talking this past weekend
[53:38] you know that talking about Christmas
[53:40] trees and stuff you know everybody
[53:41] saying well brother Brown said don't
[53:42] believe what I what you know don't pay
[53:45] attention to what I do just pay
[53:46] attention to what I say now that's
[53:47] hogwash if he live two different lives
[53:49] we're in
[53:51] trouble we're in
[53:53] trouble if I I can't look at his life
[53:56] and see Christ that's right and then see
[53:58] him preach Christ and they be two
[54:01] different lives uh wrong
[54:04] answer I believe in a body he was man I
[54:07] believe in his soul he was God he was
[54:10] God's manifestation here on Earth God
[54:13] was in Christ reconciling him or the
[54:16] world to himself I believe he's not just
[54:18] a mere man though he was not just a mere
[54:20] man he was the fullness of the godhead
[54:22] bodily all right you and I can never
[54:25] individually one person be the fullness
[54:27] ever again but he's give us power to be
[54:31] that as a collective
[54:33] body of
[54:35] Believers I believe he was not a mere
[54:38] man neither was he a prophet he was God
[54:41] Emmanuel I believe with all my heart
[54:43] that being the truth I can't prove that
[54:45] truth because if I could then it
[54:47] wouldn't be a faith
[54:49] right
[54:51] 1957 you shall see me that better all
[54:55] right you shall see me now if Christ has
[54:57] risen from the dead and we are given the
[54:59] invit invitation and the scripture that
[55:02] he promised that he we could see him and
[55:06] that we would be the same yesterday
[55:08] today and forever then would you desire
[55:10] to see him would you if You' desire
[55:12] raise your hand would every Christian
[55:14] believe it that I would with my hands up
[55:18] I would love to see him well now how can
[55:21] you see
[55:22] him we still believe brother Brown was a
[55:24] prophet right
[55:25] okay and God will speak through him okay
[55:28] the way we can see him is by his
[55:33] works the logos to the theophany into
[55:36] flesh now into your flesh now he hasn't
[55:40] come in a Corporal body yet so we're not
[55:43] looking at that one person Jesus Christ
[55:45] to be
[55:47] here
[55:49] right he hasn't come in a Corporal body
[55:51] yet Among Us he's here in a spiritual
[55:54] body you believe that a spiritual body
[55:56] called the Holy Spirit now where is that
[55:59] Holy Spirit if you're born again it's
[56:01] inside
[56:02] you that's right he's in the form of the
[56:05] Holy Spirit now in the beginning God was
[56:07] a spirit and all the Fountain of
[56:09] goodness and mercy and power and all the
[56:11] good things of love God was the center
[56:14] of that Fountain and then the lust that
[56:17] went out of God in the be beginning
[56:19] remember not something different become
[56:21] what we would call theophany in other
[56:23] words a supernatural body but it was a
[56:25] body hands feet arms legs eyes right
[56:29] God's Not Just Like the Wind he's in a
[56:31] body Moses seen him pass and say it look
[56:33] like the back part of a man and so forth
[56:36] why couldn't Moses see his
[56:37] face I'll read your scripture in a
[56:39] minute God said if you see me face to
[56:43] face you
[56:44] die wow the sin curse hadn't been took
[56:46] off yet that's right hello it was only
[56:50] covered blood of bulls and goats Hey
[56:52] listen they saw him they saw him
[56:55] at 29 years old and 30 years old and 31
[56:58] they saw God face to
[56:59] face we've seen God face to face is what
[57:03] they said remember he was veiled though
[57:05] by human skin but it was still God I
[57:08] don't think God look no different than
[57:09] he did when he was here on Earth if it
[57:12] was a different person
[57:14] then that's why Mary Magdalene didn't
[57:16] realize who he was when he come out of
[57:18] the Tomb he was back to a young man
[57:20] again and she didn't know him at 18 or
[57:21] 20 years old everybody thinks God says
[57:23] some Moses looking thing with long hair
[57:25] and the beard
[57:29] and no he's a young guy he's in the
[57:32] fountain of his
[57:34] youth if we're going to get changed back
[57:36] to the Fountain of our youth you don't
[57:37] think he's already done
[57:40] it because we're made in his IM image
[57:44] thank you if he never gets old we never
[57:46] going to get
[57:47] old that only make the old people shout
[57:50] I'll be 64 in a few weeks good
[57:53] grief did I tell yall i' be 6 you for in
[57:56] a few weeks God is just not like the air
[57:59] he's in a body Moses seen him pass and
[58:02] said it looked like the back part of a
[58:04] man now listen even God in theophany
[58:07] that had not took on the form of Jesus
[58:08] flesh yet everybody with me he still
[58:11] look like a man right but he saw the
[58:14] back
[58:16] part the hinder part yeah didn't
[58:18] couldn't see the front and then that
[58:20] same theophan now look that same
[58:23] theophany was made flesh and dwelt among
[58:25] us and we beheld him in the only
[58:26] begotten of the father who Christ Exodus
[58:30] 33 this is the account and the Lord said
[58:31] unto Moses I will do this thing also
[58:34] that thou has spoken for thou Hast found
[58:36] Grace in my sight look God had found so
[58:38] much grace in Moses give him so much
[58:40] grace excuse me and I Know Thee by name
[58:44] so he's had a relationship with him lip
[58:46] to ear and all that in the scriptures
[58:48] but finally Moses said hey I want to see
[58:51] you I saw you in a pillar of fire I saw
[58:53] you in these certain things I want to
[58:55] see you face to face and God said mm
[58:57] can't see me face to face cuz he said
[58:59] look now watch I want you to see how
[59:01] this
[59:02] develops for thou Hast found Grace in my
[59:05] sight and I Know Thee by name now see
[59:06] that's the only way he couldn't enter
[59:09] Moses come on he couldn't reside in
[59:12] Moses he could anoint him Moses could
[59:13] feel
[59:14] him but he never resided as the Holy
[59:17] Ghost resides in me and
[59:19] you and he said I beseech thee show me
[59:22] th look show me he didn't say show me
[59:24] your body he said Show Me Your
[59:29] Glory and God said
[59:33] look you know what the goodness of God
[59:36] is he's fixing to tell you right
[59:39] here we talk about the goodness of God
[59:41] and we sing about the goodness of God
[59:43] the only goodness of God is is that he's
[59:45] a human being and he's Eternal and he's
[59:48] perfect and he's imparting it to me and
[59:51] you that's the goodness of God cuz he he
[59:54] said look I will make all he didn't say
[59:56] I'll make my body he said I'll make all
[59:59] my
[1:00:00] goodness pass before thee now watch and
[1:00:03] I will proclaim the name of the Lord
[1:00:04] before
[1:00:06] thee and will be gracious to whom I will
[1:00:08] be gracious and show Mercy on whom I
[1:00:11] will show mercy and he said thou cast
[1:00:13] not see my face for there shall no man
[1:00:15] see me and
[1:00:17] live amen how holy a
[1:00:22] God but that God became and I'm going
[1:00:24] say it like this became so Unholy he
[1:00:27] came into a human flesh that was
[1:00:29] stinking rotting getting ready to
[1:00:30] getting ready to die he came into
[1:00:32] something like that to show itself to me
[1:00:34] and you so that he could take us into
[1:00:36] the Holiness of
[1:00:38] himself and he'll have scars all over
[1:00:40] his body and nail prints and we won't
[1:00:42] have
[1:00:44] that and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:00:46] place by me and thou shalt stand upon a
[1:00:48] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[1:00:51] look he never says my body he he says my
[1:00:55] Glory passest by that I will put thee in
[1:00:58] the Cliff of The Rock and I will cover
[1:01:00] thee with my hand while I pass
[1:01:03] by and I will take away mine hand and
[1:01:06] thou shalt see my back Parts but my face
[1:01:09] shall not be seen now brother Bram
[1:01:11] continues I I don't think I found the
[1:01:13] quote but brother Bram says Moses saw
[1:01:16] the back part of Jesus Christ all right
[1:01:18] that wasn't the flesh that theophany had
[1:01:21] become so real into this Dimension till
[1:01:23] Moses looked at it it looked just like a
[1:01:24] human being right cuz it was a human
[1:01:26] being it was a human being when we talk
[1:01:28] about humanity and human being we think
[1:01:30] about this rotten and getting older and
[1:01:33] dying and getting gray and getting bald
[1:01:36] God's in a human body right and it's
[1:01:39] perfect amen cuz listen if he can't get
[1:01:42] into one we
[1:01:45] can't right if he didn't come to
[1:01:47] Perfection we
[1:01:50] can't well don't get quiet on me if he
[1:01:53] can't come to Perfection we can't we
[1:01:54] know he came to Perfection therefore we
[1:01:56] can come to
[1:01:58] Perfection all right now brother Brown
[1:02:00] we he talks about this about Loose Ends
[1:02:03] the loose ends now watch I want to read
[1:02:05] this quote in
[1:02:07] 59 I want to take this scripture Matthew
[1:02:10] 28:19 go ye and teach All Nations
[1:02:12] baptized in the name of the Father and
[1:02:14] Son and Holy Ghost how was you baptized
[1:02:16] in the name of the father and the name
[1:02:18] of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:19] that's not even written in the scripture
[1:02:20] and I want some man the Blessed Holy
[1:02:22] Trinity find me the word Trinity
[1:02:24] anywhere in the pages of God's Bible it
[1:02:27] said look it's a manmade
[1:02:30] scheme it's not the
[1:02:33] logos an old dirty Church
[1:02:39] rag right wrapped around to take the
[1:02:43] place of the sapine of God's holy spirit
[1:02:48] that's why God couldn't move through the
[1:02:50] church ages he got
[1:02:52] bound right so something got
[1:02:56] cut there's no such a thing there's no
[1:02:59] such a thing you find it and come to me
[1:03:01] your duty bound to do it as a Christian
[1:03:03] if you find it it's not in God's holy
[1:03:06] writings and the father Son and Holy
[1:03:08] Ghost is hatched out of hell that's
[1:03:11] pretty strong you believe the L people
[1:03:14] in what year was that 1959 there's a lot
[1:03:17] of people left him and didn't walk with
[1:03:19] him after
[1:03:20] that and father son Holy Ghost is
[1:03:22] hatched Out of Hell there's no such
[1:03:24] thing as three Gods
[1:03:27] amen Revelation chap 5
[1:03:32] 1961 now if that was all hatched out of
[1:03:35] hell hell being Eternal was hatched out
[1:03:37] of hell you know what he's saying he
[1:03:39] says that Doctrine didn't start in
[1:03:43] heaven in in layman terms that he's
[1:03:46] saying he separate said that Doctrine
[1:03:48] didn't start in heaven the Lost never
[1:03:50] spoke
[1:03:52] that when the Lost was in Christ said
[1:03:54] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:03:56] of the Son and the Holy Ghost that
[1:03:57] Locust wasn't thinking three
[1:04:01] titles but he hid it from man so that
[1:04:05] man had to come to a revelation pise the
[1:04:08] Lord man had to come to a revelation
[1:04:12] that that was saying the same thing
[1:04:14] because that logos that theophany of God
[1:04:17] that was standing there that said that
[1:04:19] he just moved over into
[1:04:21] Peter and said the same thing but he
[1:04:24] told him exactly cuz now you know
[1:04:26] something there's a name attached to it
[1:04:29] in the name of the father son Holy Ghost
[1:04:31] what is the name of the father son Holy
[1:04:32] Ghost Lord Jesus Christ right right
[1:04:35] that's why all the lose s that's why
[1:04:36] brother Ram had to come because listen
[1:04:38] when the son of man Ministry hits the
[1:04:40] Earth and I contend it's here now can't
[1:04:44] have one error to it right did Jesus
[1:04:47] have one error was there a time when he
[1:04:50] said I didn't oh whoops I'm sorry I
[1:04:52] didn't do what the father said today
[1:04:55] right you said boy that's that's just
[1:04:57] insurmountable well listen if the guy
[1:04:59] that spoke
[1:05:00] it and the guy that wrote it is inside
[1:05:04] of
[1:05:07] you Romans 8 says if that same spirit
[1:05:10] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:05:13] in you it'll Quicken your mortal Body by
[1:05:17] that same spirit that dwells in you but
[1:05:20] listen to this boy I thought this was
[1:05:21] pretty neat we talk about Jubilee now
[1:05:24] remember just a background some of you
[1:05:26] that hadn't been here
[1:05:28] along we are living
[1:05:31] under the seven Jubilee
[1:05:35] years in the Bible according to
[1:05:37] Leviticus you could read it Leviticus 25
[1:05:40] 24 and 25 everybody with me if you've
[1:05:43] been here a long time you know brother
[1:05:44] Dell's already covered this because the
[1:05:46] church ages they couldn't get all the
[1:05:48] way out of their denominational idea so
[1:05:50] they were under a seven cuz remember
[1:05:52] every seven years there was a the
[1:05:54] Jubilee year and certain amount of
[1:05:56] things got to go free certain amount of
[1:05:58] things had to stay just for just for an
[1:06:01] overview we may cover it later on but
[1:06:03] did everybody understand that every
[1:06:04] seven years was not a golden
[1:06:08] jubilee it was a seven years Jubilee
[1:06:10] that every seven years something got to
[1:06:13] go free but not everything remember if
[1:06:16] you m just read it cuz if you Mar
[1:06:18] somebody and you married them over they
[1:06:19] gave you a wife you had to leave her and
[1:06:21] all this it's kind of complicated
[1:06:23] because listen you had to leave
[1:06:25] something right
[1:06:28] am we're not living in an age of leaving
[1:06:31] something they and Luther they left
[1:06:34] something Wesley they left something
[1:06:37] Pentecost they left something and this
[1:06:39] message we'll leave
[1:06:42] nothing cuz listen we're in a 50 now
[1:06:45] we're in a jubilee we've been called out
[1:06:47] of the church ages the church ages is
[1:06:49] seven Church ages times seven years is
[1:06:52] 49 yes
[1:06:55] we're at the Jubilee we preached this
[1:06:57] before brother Dev preached it before
[1:07:00] when they got the Holy Ghost it was on
[1:07:04] pente cost that's right
[1:07:07] 50 and let me tell you something they
[1:07:10] got to go free in their
[1:07:12] soul but they didn't get to go free in
[1:07:14] their
[1:07:15] body CU it wasn't
[1:07:19] time because another seven years started
[1:07:22] or another church a started
[1:07:24] there is no other Church ages so we've
[1:07:27] been called out of the church ages you
[1:07:29] stay in the church ages you're going to
[1:07:31] die that's right but watch now okay I
[1:07:34] said all that and now look watch what
[1:07:35] brother R says Watch the watch the logos
[1:07:38] speak to us they could not hold it for
[1:07:40] that past that 50th day he means 50th
[1:07:43] year cuz that was the day of Jubilee
[1:07:46] when everything back went back to its
[1:07:49] original beginning now just for an
[1:07:51] overview real
[1:07:52] quick when they had a jubilee over seven
[1:07:55] years they let something go and
[1:07:57] something had to stay right but that
[1:07:59] 49th year that next year was a supposed
[1:08:03] to be a jubilee year where every listen
[1:08:05] if you ow $10 million and had 300
[1:08:09] slaves at the end of that year you went
[1:08:13] back to zero
[1:08:14] dollars and zero slaves and you started
[1:08:17] all over again that's why the Jews have
[1:08:19] never celebrated a physical Jubilee year
[1:08:24] now you can read that on the internet
[1:08:25] they've never done it cuz you know what
[1:08:26] the Jew ain't going to give up $10
[1:08:27] million just because the Bible said
[1:08:31] so a holy ghost fill one
[1:08:34] would amen but not a but not a but not a
[1:08:38] a regular Jew that's got all this wealth
[1:08:39] and all of a sudden he's back to zero
[1:08:41] cuz it it it levels everybody
[1:08:43] out right so now watch though watch what
[1:08:47] he says watch what he saying real
[1:08:49] quick cuz that was a day of Jubilee when
[1:08:52] everything went back to its original
[1:08:53] original
[1:08:55] beginning now
[1:08:57] remember Jesus was the
[1:09:00] beginning of the creation of
[1:09:03] God right the beginning of the creation
[1:09:07] of
[1:09:08] God the power of God was taken back to
[1:09:14] its
[1:09:15] original the 50th day or 50th year he
[1:09:18] means the Year of Jubilee when all
[1:09:21] things went back what did Jesus
[1:09:26] say he came out of the Tomb he said what
[1:09:29] all
[1:09:30] power in other words lay your ho
[1:09:35] down take your shackles
[1:09:38] off turn your books back cuz
[1:09:41] everything's went back to zero now I am
[1:09:44] going to bring everything back and I'm
[1:09:47] not going to leave one
[1:09:49] thing but they didn't believe
[1:09:51] it right exactly and it started right
[1:09:54] back to that seventh year again seven
[1:09:56] years again and it just kept on that
[1:09:57] cycle of seven seven years seven Church
[1:10:00] ages and they didn't get all the way out
[1:10:02] they had to go right back into bondage
[1:10:03] because they had a false doctrine that
[1:10:05] took them back into
[1:10:07] bondage amen false Doctrine cannot set
[1:10:10] you free never will never has set you
[1:10:14] free but Jesus came and spake unto them
[1:10:17] saying all poers given unto me in heaven
[1:10:18] and earth now where'd he give it to
[1:10:20] after
[1:10:22] that we'll see you in a
[1:10:25] minute because remember he breathed on
[1:10:27] them after he came out of the
[1:10:31] Tomb and there will come another Year of
[1:10:34] Jubilee and that we've had it just about
[1:10:37] this
[1:10:40] time if you notice Pentecost has been
[1:10:43] falling in America for about 50 years
[1:10:47] somewhere on that time just about 50
[1:10:49] years ago Pentecost began to fall now
[1:10:51] what's happening the church is receiving
[1:10:54] the seven sealed book of the revelation
[1:10:56] of Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals not
[1:10:59] one tenth of them can receive
[1:11:03] it cuz remember even though they blew
[1:11:07] the trumpet they blew the
[1:11:10] message right got on the highest
[1:11:13] mountain they could get on got brother
[1:11:15] said get up the highest tree they could
[1:11:17] get on and when they sounded that
[1:11:19] trumpet you laid down your hole and you
[1:11:20] went free but remember there was a group
[1:11:22] of people
[1:11:24] that didn't want
[1:11:26] to there's a group of people that
[1:11:28] enjoyed the life they were living they
[1:11:31] enjoyed come on somebody they enjoyed
[1:11:33] the world more than they enjoyed God so
[1:11:36] what happened was the priest would look
[1:11:39] and say hey all these people have left
[1:11:41] what's wrong with you well I just think
[1:11:43] I'll I'll take this old false Doctrine
[1:11:45] and and I'll just live any way I want to
[1:11:47] I just can't help it he said come here
[1:11:50] I'm going to give you a sign right
[1:11:52] that's right I'm going to take take and
[1:11:53] I'm going to take an all and I'm going
[1:11:55] to put your ear up against the temple
[1:11:57] post everybody understand that they were
[1:11:59] in church put it against the temple post
[1:12:03] and Bard a hole in your ear that's right
[1:12:08] that's right
[1:12:11] EXA right if you wear earrings you bound
[1:12:14] I guess whatever ESP guys but anyway so
[1:12:18] you Bor that and that was a sign that
[1:12:20] you could never ever
[1:12:22] never didn't matter the next seven years
[1:12:25] didn't matter the next seven years
[1:12:27] brother Danny it didn't matter for the
[1:12:28] rest of that person's life that Mark was
[1:12:30] on
[1:12:31] them and they died lost right they died
[1:12:36] in
[1:12:37] bondage just because they made a choice
[1:12:40] not to go free cuz everybody could go I
[1:12:41] mean the priest didn't go now you can go
[1:12:43] and you can't no you laid your hold down
[1:12:46] you laughed if you stood there and you
[1:12:48] stayed in the field and you were happy
[1:12:50] where you was at they marked you and you
[1:12:52] stayed marked the rest rest of the time
[1:12:54] it wasn't just let oh I forgive you a
[1:12:55] little bit later no I was the rest of
[1:12:57] your life am so let's don't be bored in
[1:13:00] the air tonight he that have an near let
[1:13:03] him hear what the spirit says to the
[1:13:05] church the
[1:13:07] logos that's the spirit of God but when
[1:13:11] you begin to see the year Jubilee where
[1:13:13] we don't have to fuss and strain and
[1:13:16] pull like
[1:13:17] this but we're already secured in Christ
[1:13:21] we already have the name of the the Lord
[1:13:23] Jesus Christ now watch him he's putting
[1:13:25] his loose hands together he's telling
[1:13:27] them listen you got a pathway now thank
[1:13:31] you amen we have all these great
[1:13:33] Mysteries that we're going to bring up
[1:13:35] in the Seven Seals and prove to you that
[1:13:38] them was the seals that were sealed from
[1:13:40] the eyes of the people right of God
[1:13:45] being my helper I'll prove to you that
[1:13:47] they could not see that by the
[1:13:50] Bible amen even though they looked at
[1:13:53] the letter of
[1:13:57] it then sure if the Bible said so you'll
[1:14:00] believe it that they could not see
[1:14:02] nothing but father son Holy Ghost until
[1:14:04] this time come on you see that how that
[1:14:07] was so that ingrained in that third
[1:14:09] Church age when n see a Rome when those
[1:14:12] Catholics come out and said this is the
[1:14:14] way it's going to be we're going to
[1:14:15] baptize like this if not you're going to
[1:14:17] die and they accepted it
[1:14:21] right B the air right they got bored in
[1:14:25] the air that's
[1:14:27] right they could not see that there was
[1:14:29] no eternal hell until this time they
[1:14:32] couldn't see the father son Holy Ghost
[1:14:34] was false until this time they could not
[1:14:37] see that there was an eternal security I
[1:14:39] mean for the real believer of course
[1:14:41] there's been a mock of it all the way
[1:14:42] around an uncertain sound they give
[1:14:45] that's the reason the people they say
[1:14:47] why look at them Presbyterians and so
[1:14:49] forth smoke and drink and everything
[1:14:50] else and say they got eternal security
[1:14:53] yeah but you see that's to throw off the
[1:14:55] real
[1:14:57] trumpet he said let's find out back here
[1:15:00] find out whether the trumpet sounded we
[1:15:02] we know we've the the trumpet's already
[1:15:03] been sounded the shout The Voice the
[1:15:06] trumpet it's here we're not looking for
[1:15:09] it man may be looking for it but I'm
[1:15:12] not if you don't come Plum back to
[1:15:14] Genesis revelations back and forth when
[1:15:16] this seal is open see these things being
[1:15:19] revealed Revelations 3:14 to the angel
[1:15:22] of the Church of LA to s write these
[1:15:23] things sayth the amen the faithful and
[1:15:25] true witness the beginning of the
[1:15:28] creation of God now the beginning of the
[1:15:31] creation of God began as brother R said
[1:15:34] in the womb of a woman not Son of
[1:15:39] God the title of Son of God was over
[1:15:42] here the Creator he's the one that was
[1:15:43] the logos he was the one that that took
[1:15:46] a body
[1:15:47] form amen perfect complete Eternal no
[1:15:52] flesh he had his own flesh I believe a
[1:15:55] theophan got flesh okay it's just ain't
[1:15:57] a flesh that you brother Brown said an
[1:15:59] eye better than your eye ear better than
[1:16:00] your ear you see what I'm see what I'm
[1:16:02] saying cuz he had to be in that form to
[1:16:05] say I'm going to make something in my
[1:16:06] form right I'm going to create something
[1:16:09] in my
[1:16:11] image but the beginning of the creation
[1:16:13] of God made him the son of
[1:16:16] man back the way it should have been had
[1:16:19] there not been a
[1:16:22] fall don't get
[1:16:24] quiet remember a couple Sundays ago this
[1:16:28] Revelations chapter 4 remember a couple
[1:16:30] Sundays ago we got to it that big
[1:16:32] diamond but it's cut many different ways
[1:16:34] to reflect the fire and light from it
[1:16:36] that's the way Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:37] beginning of the creation of God
[1:16:39] Revelations 1 is that right then when
[1:16:42] was God created he is the beginning of
[1:16:45] the creation of God and God is eternal
[1:16:47] is that right but when God was created
[1:16:49] when a little baby that was conceived in
[1:16:52] the womb of a mother
[1:16:53] a virgin and she began to develop these
[1:16:56] cells within her to bring forth this
[1:16:57] little baby that was the beginning of
[1:17:00] God's
[1:17:03] creation cuz
[1:17:05] remember God may have gave you a
[1:17:07] soul but your body wasn't spoken into
[1:17:11] existence right everybody sitting in
[1:17:13] this building and everybody that lives
[1:17:14] in this world knows how well not Young
[1:17:17] on but we all know how that happens amen
[1:17:21] and it might be a Wonder ful thing but
[1:17:25] we men own the one side of the germ and
[1:17:28] the woman owns the other side there's
[1:17:30] nothing Supernatural about it now the
[1:17:33] bringing it together and bringing you
[1:17:35] was pretty Supernatural but he's talking
[1:17:38] about man have nothing to do with it
[1:17:42] right just believe that's right that was
[1:17:46] the beginning of God's creation for God
[1:17:48] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[1:17:49] became Emanuel God With Us the beginning
[1:17:52] of the the creation of God now watch
[1:17:55] then in that great Jewel that come from
[1:17:57] the dust because he was he was made of
[1:17:59] dust is that right eat food like we did
[1:18:01] talking about Jesus Christ eat food like
[1:18:02] you do dust of the body he became Cal
[1:18:05] and potach petroleum Cosmic light but in
[1:18:08] him dwelt Eternal
[1:18:10] Light okay now we don't start out that
[1:18:14] way he did all right but we end up that
[1:18:17] way if we accept that he started that
[1:18:19] way everybody with me on that right he
[1:18:23] started with eternal light we didn't but
[1:18:26] when we receive eternal life it's just
[1:18:28] like he started remember because we're a
[1:18:30] new creation everything goes back that's
[1:18:34] the only time you need to go
[1:18:37] back no wonder the wise men said to the
[1:18:39] star guide us to thy Perfect Light they
[1:18:42] were just reflecting the light of one
[1:18:44] Perfect Light and there he was the
[1:18:46] perfect light of God the beginning of
[1:18:48] the creation of God and then brother
[1:18:50] Brown tells us later on he says you are
[1:18:52] a Contin uation of that creation if
[1:18:54] there's a beginning there's got to be
[1:18:57] something that that progresses from that
[1:18:59] cuz remember in the beginning God
[1:19:01] created heaven and earth well are we
[1:19:03] stuck back there no we're here
[1:19:08] today just a few more
[1:19:10] minutes God himself came down into a
[1:19:13] blood cell and wrapped the blood around
[1:19:14] him the blood cell The Germ of Life Of
[1:19:16] God himself wrapped in this blood cell
[1:19:19] that brought forth the son Christ Jesus
[1:19:22] now what he did does by that to make you
[1:19:26] perfect and to bring you back into
[1:19:27] Fellowship he brings you through that
[1:19:29] blood
[1:19:32] cell by Supernatural
[1:19:35] birth everybody with
[1:19:37] me into himself you get it through the
[1:19:41] blood cell of the Lord Jesus that
[1:19:42] unveiled the life of Jehovah and we
[1:19:45] coming through the blood cell becomes a
[1:19:48] part of that life not what you're
[1:19:49] sitting in
[1:19:51] today right he's talking about eternal
[1:19:58] life so deity itself lays in the man
[1:20:02] that's received the Holy
[1:20:05] Spirit you are a son I'm a Brandon by
[1:20:07] birth and a part of Mr MIRS brandom is
[1:20:09] in me and if you become a son or a
[1:20:12] daughter of God part of deity lays in
[1:20:14] you amen do you believe that sir we
[1:20:18] better start believing it cuz that's
[1:20:19] what's going to emanate from now on
[1:20:21] that's what's going to come out when we
[1:20:22] to that statue of perfect man when we
[1:20:24] get up to the top what happened all that
[1:20:25] water started coming out took all the
[1:20:28] trash out of it and became really Pure
[1:20:29] Clean Water that's what we're going to
[1:20:31] work on this this uh this year if we
[1:20:35] make it through another year did you
[1:20:37] never ever notice a baby when it's born
[1:20:39] it's little muscles twitching and
[1:20:40] jerking we've been through this before
[1:20:42] it becomes a living soul and as soon as
[1:20:44] a soul goes back from that little body
[1:20:45] there's another one waiting for it now
[1:20:47] that's not two souls okay cuz I'm going
[1:20:50] to read you a quote here in just a
[1:20:51] minute to make sure that we know where
[1:20:52] where that Soul's at and stays because
[1:20:55] first God makes the soul in spirit it
[1:20:57] just goes into the
[1:20:59] body so what's happening when man and
[1:21:01] woman gets together and they they have
[1:21:04] the act and and the the the muscles
[1:21:06] start making and and they're connected
[1:21:08] to the mother and the blood flows
[1:21:09] through the mother into the into the
[1:21:11] baby and she eats and it gets bigger and
[1:21:14] it makes parts and then it comes out all
[1:21:17] right but before that it's just Wiggly
[1:21:19] muscles It's Not a Human Being now they
[1:21:21] can say all they want to about all this
[1:21:23] and I agree abortion is totally wrong
[1:21:26] but brother R tells us that unless it
[1:21:27] breathes breath it's not a human being
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:32] right right cuz listen there's not a
[1:21:34] bunch of souls hanging around over here
[1:21:36] that ain't got a body to go to God ain't
[1:21:38] that way right he knows exactly what
[1:21:41] he's doing and he knew that was going to
[1:21:43] happen but that's just the devil
[1:21:45] perverting what's supposed to be good
[1:21:48] and when we leave here we only change
[1:21:50] Dwelling Places and go to
[1:21:53] another for if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:21:56] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:21:57] so that's our consolation the comforter
[1:22:00] 1961 now watch it's just like a little
[1:22:03] baby when a little baby is conceived in
[1:22:04] the mother's womb it's just Flesh and
[1:22:07] Blood jumping
[1:22:09] quivering amen reaction to um neurons
[1:22:14] and and and all that you know it's it's
[1:22:16] firing cuz you do have a heartbeat I
[1:22:18] mean the thing starts beating after how
[1:22:20] many weeks six weeks or so after the
[1:22:23] conception but as soon as it's born you
[1:22:25] don't see it but there's a spirit in the
[1:22:28] soul hanging near that mother to come
[1:22:30] into that baby just soon as it's born do
[1:22:33] we believe brother R was a prophet I
[1:22:35] believe he could see in another
[1:22:36] dimension and I believe he could see
[1:22:38] that just as soon as that baby is born
[1:22:41] God has created a soul and created a
[1:22:43] spirit to be in that baby just as soon
[1:22:46] as it's born into this world that little
[1:22:50] baby becomes matured and it begins to
[1:22:53] learn then it becomes a living Soul when
[1:22:56] it knows what's right or wrong now
[1:22:57] listen it's not a dead
[1:22:59] one it has a choice to make
[1:23:03] amen cuz remember all babies go to
[1:23:05] heaven if you're under the age of
[1:23:06] accountability there's nothing held
[1:23:07] against you so that soul will become
[1:23:10] Eternal it's not Eternal it'll become
[1:23:12] Eternal when we get over on the other
[1:23:13] side everybody with
[1:23:15] me now this is it's just as simple as to
[1:23:18] me it's the simplest way to to you know
[1:23:20] man can say this and say that but this
[1:23:22] is is very simple what happens to a
[1:23:24] human being at Birth and at death and
[1:23:27] while we're here and it becomes a living
[1:23:30] soul that knows what's right or wrong
[1:23:31] then it's got just like Adam and Eve set
[1:23:34] before a tree of right and wrong it
[1:23:36] makes its Choice and then it becomes
[1:23:38] intelligent it's growing all the time in
[1:23:40] God's Great economy finally it comes
[1:23:43] down to the end of the road for this
[1:23:44] physical body and just as this body is
[1:23:46] deteriorating and going away there's one
[1:23:48] being prepared to receive it not one
[1:23:50] over there it's it's you it's your soul
[1:23:53] it's inside of you you know you may be
[1:23:55] all humped over a hundred years old but
[1:23:59] if you're born again today your soul is
[1:24:00] 18 years old I just wished it would come
[1:24:03] out every once in a
[1:24:06] while there's one being prepared to
[1:24:08] receive it just as soon as it leaves
[1:24:10] here this Soul that's in us now and look
[1:24:13] this Spirit leaves this body and goes to
[1:24:15] another a young one a good one a better
[1:24:18] one a one that won't get old or one that
[1:24:20] won't pass away he's a good god
[1:24:23] certainly is am so listen to this this a
[1:24:26] church age book we'll stop right
[1:24:30] here now this is going to explain a lot
[1:24:33] of things CU you can say well he's
[1:24:35] explaining I got a soul over there and
[1:24:37] then I just migrate over to this
[1:24:40] one uh-uh cuz the soul is a being it's a
[1:24:43] real you there's not another soul of you
[1:24:46] somewhere come on thatd make you another
[1:24:49] person somewhere you'd be a
[1:24:50] schizophrenic or whatever they call that
[1:24:52] that multiple
[1:24:54] personalities you will want to know if I
[1:24:57] believe in the doctrine of pre-existence
[1:25:00] now watch God he just explained that God
[1:25:03] is waiting
[1:25:05] there with life not eternal life life
[1:25:08] just like he did Adam he put life into
[1:25:10] Adam he breathe that's why you smack the
[1:25:14] baby it starts breathing what God give
[1:25:18] it life he didn't give it eternal life
[1:25:21] he gave it a life
[1:25:22] to make a choice but that soul never
[1:25:26] will leave your body until you
[1:25:28] die unless God decides like he did
[1:25:30] Brother randam to take you over into
[1:25:32] another dimension and show you what's
[1:25:33] going on that was one man is your if you
[1:25:37] well some of us may have took a trip but
[1:25:38] who
[1:25:39] knows so
[1:25:41] anyway I got a cousin is he said my
[1:25:43] sister takes a trip and never leaves a
[1:25:45] recliner
[1:25:47] so you will want to know if I believe in
[1:25:50] the doctrine of pre-existence now watch
[1:25:52] this is how he explains it I don't
[1:25:55] believe in that Mormon doctrine of
[1:25:57] pre-existence of souls all right Mormon
[1:25:59] Doctrine is we were all people in
[1:26:01] another
[1:26:02] dimension with God I mean with god well
[1:26:05] God in Jesus okie dokie and Lucifer was
[1:26:08] there we all kind of lived around each
[1:26:11] other and all of a sudden somebody got
[1:26:14] an idea Jesus got the idea that we need
[1:26:17] to come to Earth to display the
[1:26:21] father
[1:26:23] pretty much what it is it may not be
[1:26:24] everything but I had two Mormons work
[1:26:26] for me and they tried to explain it it's
[1:26:28] it's really confusing this is very much
[1:26:30] more less confusing is just I'm right
[1:26:32] here and I go there but they believe
[1:26:35] that pre-existence so then you come down
[1:26:37] here and inhabit bodies but Lucifer had
[1:26:39] a better
[1:26:41] plan he thought so they presented it to
[1:26:44] the father Jesus did and Lucifer did and
[1:26:49] of course the father's going to take the
[1:26:50] son's side and Lucifer got left out well
[1:26:54] Lucifer got mad as any other devil
[1:26:58] would and so he said I've gather me a
[1:27:01] bunch of people and we'll go do our own
[1:27:02] thing well that's their pretty much
[1:27:04] their Doctrine so that's how we got down
[1:27:07] here so brother R said I don't believe
[1:27:09] in that Mormon Doctrine the
[1:27:11] pre-existence of souls so look any more
[1:27:14] than I believe in
[1:27:17] reincarnation or transmigration which
[1:27:21] means
[1:27:22] God forbid I can go into your
[1:27:26] body and you could come into mine God
[1:27:30] see that's why you you're not switching
[1:27:31] around you are who you are from birth to
[1:27:36] death you're that person you're here to
[1:27:38] make a choice if you make the wrong
[1:27:40] choice you're going over there to be
[1:27:42] judged if you make the right choice
[1:27:43] you're going over here to have eternal
[1:27:45] life you have eternal life here but it's
[1:27:47] taking you somewhere into a place of
[1:27:49] Refuge a place to stay all right so he
[1:27:52] don't believe in reincarnation either
[1:27:54] we're not going to come back as somebody
[1:27:55] else we're not going to come back as a
[1:27:57] tree or a set of drums or anything like
[1:27:59] that that's what the Islamic people or
[1:28:01] whoever that is they believe
[1:28:03] that I that is why they don't kill bugs
[1:28:06] and all that stuff because they believe
[1:28:07] it's their
[1:28:08] ancestors that'd be
[1:28:10] horrible be careful here and see this
[1:28:13] it's not the
[1:28:15] person watch that comes predestinated
[1:28:18] eternally from
[1:28:19] God it's the word or seed listen I'm not
[1:28:22] interpolating but I'm telling you it's
[1:28:24] the seed that develops
[1:28:26] it that's what develops this whole thing
[1:28:29] the word are we not word born children
[1:28:31] and know what you we're word born
[1:28:34] children all right now listen we're born
[1:28:37] of Samuel and Peggy de to make a choice
[1:28:39] to become word born children then that
[1:28:41] Soul then is not
[1:28:44] exchanged that soul is not killed
[1:28:47] because when your if your soul dies
[1:28:49] you're way over under because there's
[1:28:50] only one person that can kill the soul
[1:28:52] soul and that's God amen amen remember
[1:28:55] he stood here on Earth he said don't you
[1:28:57] worry about them people that can kill
[1:28:58] your body you better worry about that
[1:29:01] guy that can kill your soul and send it
[1:29:02] to hell now who is that that ain't the
[1:29:05] devil that's God but it's because of the
[1:29:07] choice you make that's right be careful
[1:29:10] here and see this it's not the person
[1:29:12] that comes predestinated eternally from
[1:29:13] God it is the word of SE or seed that is
[1:29:17] it way back there too far back for the
[1:29:20] human mind to grow
[1:29:24] grasp the god Eternal god with eternal
[1:29:27] thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have
[1:29:29] I loved but Esau have I hated and
[1:29:33] neither was born neither had done good
[1:29:35] and evil but God saw in his mind by for
[1:29:38] knowledge which one would and which one
[1:29:40] wouldn't put them down here give them a
[1:29:42] choice but he already knew what the
[1:29:43] choice was see it was the thought look
[1:29:47] then that thought became
[1:29:50] expressed and God bought back Jacob
[1:29:53] because Jacob alone was seed part of
[1:29:56] God Jacob alone had the seed that is why
[1:29:59] he had respect to the birthright and
[1:30:02] Covenant of God if you are true seed you
[1:30:05] will hear that word the spirit will
[1:30:07] baptize you into the body of Christ so
[1:30:09] there's a there's not just you you
[1:30:11] already had
[1:30:14] it right you'll hear the
[1:30:17] word then the spirit will baptize you
[1:30:19] into the body of Christ filling you and
[1:30:23] empowering you and you will receive the
[1:30:25] word for your day and age see how clear
[1:30:29] the true evidence becomes when the word
[1:30:31] is revealed to you Jesus was the royal
[1:30:33] seed he lived in the human body when the
[1:30:35] spirit called to him he went to Jordan
[1:30:37] it was baptized in water upon obeying
[1:30:39] the word the Holy Spirit came upon him
[1:30:41] and a voice said this is my beloved Son
[1:30:42] hear you him the voice did not say this
[1:30:45] is become my son Jesus was the son the
[1:30:48] Holy Ghost positioned him see remember
[1:30:50] brother brother Brown made it clear and
[1:30:51] I'm we made it clear here Jesus was not
[1:30:54] just a mortal human something and then
[1:30:56] he received the Holy Ghost to make him
[1:30:58] God on the River Jordan the Bible says
[1:31:00] he was born Emmanuel God With Us how
[1:31:04] much more plain can you be anything past
[1:31:06] that I don't believe amen if you want to
[1:31:09] make him something common yeah he was
[1:31:11] common he was common
[1:31:13] God Amen Jesus was the son the Holy
[1:31:16] Ghost positioned him as that son before
[1:31:20] them all just like you will me and you
[1:31:22] then having been filled thus in the same
[1:31:25] pattern holds at Pentecost and Ever
[1:31:26] After he went and demonstrated power
[1:31:29] receiving the full revelation of God and
[1:31:31] from God for that day Paul says I pray
[1:31:36] God your whole spirit and soul and body
[1:31:38] be preserved blameless until the coming
[1:31:39] of our Lord Jesus look Faithful Is He
[1:31:41] that calls you who also will do it he's
[1:31:44] the only one that can preserve you you
[1:31:47] just got to make
[1:31:48] Choice all right let's read this when it
[1:31:52] come musicians come
[1:31:55] on when that sacrifice is received by
[1:31:58] the fire and it goes up like that and
[1:31:59] the smoke goes up you rise up with your
[1:32:01] sacrifice into the heavenlies and you're
[1:32:03] sealed away from the things of the world
[1:32:05] then our souls on his
[1:32:09] altar what are you done then after you
[1:32:12] have been died then what are you to do
[1:32:17] then you are conceived a new you are
[1:32:19] conceived a new you was first first
[1:32:22] conceived in iniquity let's stand to our
[1:32:23] feet now you're conceived in something
[1:32:27] new right what is it the Living Word all
[1:32:31] that changes it now doesn't it now we're
[1:32:33] through the struggle after seeing what
[1:32:35] you got to do now what happens you're
[1:32:37] conceived a new in the Living
[1:32:41] Word all right you begin to see things
[1:32:45] different where once you couldn't see
[1:32:48] that once you couldn't see water baptism
[1:32:50] what you couldn't see there was no
[1:32:51] eternal hell couldn't say about the the
[1:32:53] not the legalism of the of the word of
[1:32:55] God but the truth of the word of God
[1:32:58] Amen it's like what brother said we're
[1:32:59] not legalists people call us legalists
[1:33:01] we just doing what the Bible
[1:33:03] said all right where once you couldn't
[1:33:06] see that now you do see it there's
[1:33:09] something different now makes all the
[1:33:11] scriptures come together makes
[1:33:13] everything dovetail just right then now
[1:33:16] now something begins to happen now you
[1:33:18] die to your own thinking now you're
[1:33:21] conceived
[1:33:22] because we are Washed by the Water of
[1:33:24] the word is that right what do you do
[1:33:26] with a baby as soon as it's born you
[1:33:29] wash it is that right as soon as a man
[1:33:31] has died to himself and born of God he's
[1:33:34] Washed by the Water of the word amen if
[1:33:37] it says Jesus name you say Jesus name if
[1:33:40] it says You must be born again let's say
[1:33:43] the same thing ever what God says you're
[1:33:46] washed by that water of the word amen
[1:33:48] now look now read this right here now
[1:33:50] you're ready now for for life you
[1:33:52] thought you had life back
[1:33:55] then you're dead while you're alive

[1:34:00] dead while she liveth has a name she's
[1:34:03] dead they're ready to be start out now

[1:34:09] of God with new
[1:34:10] parents yes sir your tutor used to be
[1:34:13] now you got tutors that is now you got a
[1:34:15] new parent you can't be born without
[1:34:17] having a parent so if you're born in the
[1:34:19] Brotherhood of a church that's what you
[1:34:21] got if you're born in a Creed there you
[1:34:24] are but if you're born in God conceived
[1:34:27] in his word you got a new parent that's
[1:34:31] God ready to make his word known among
[1:34:33] you with you and speak it through you
[1:34:35] the
[1:34:37] logos oh a new parent that parent is God
[1:34:41] he's ready to take his word now that
[1:34:43] he's already spoke and lay it in you and
[1:34:47] make it come to life now look we've been
[1:34:50] talking about training we've been
[1:34:51] talking about Statue of perfect man he
[1:34:52] said
[1:34:54] now now you have your training
[1:34:57] now you're ready to go into training now
[1:35:00] child training that's the hard part when
[1:35:04] you think you ought to do this and the
[1:35:06] word Cuts you around and shows you
[1:35:08] something
[1:35:09] else huh while they believe that over
[1:35:13] that don't make any difference what they
[1:35:15] believe here's what God said you must be
[1:35:18] about the father's business now you're
[1:35:21] getting born again now you're getting
[1:35:24] right getting straightened out you have
[1:35:27] a new parent so in order if you're born

[1:36:05] motion but this is what it ends up to
[1:36:09] amen right you once was going this way

[1:36:14] affections are set on things above a new
[1:36:16] affection you don't love the things of
[1:36:19] the world no more your affections of God

[1:37:30] can't realize it I'll see the works of
[1:37:33] it amen it's got to start with you in
[1:37:35] your bedroom or you in your closet or
[1:37:37] you and your wherever you in your house
[1:37:39] it's got to start with you then it will
[1:37:41] emanate out if there's a change yeah

[1:45:51] you can touch it you will
[1:45:56] never be the same now if you're at home
[1:46:00] and watching in and you don't get one of
[1:46:02] these prayer cloths just cut your a
[1:46:03] little section of cloth off of something
[1:46:05] and and um a handkerchief or something
[1:46:08] while you're at home and and be a part
[1:46:11] of us we don't want you to be excluded
[1:46:13] we can't send you a prayer cloth right
[1:46:14] now but just cut your little piece off
[1:46:17] and and hold it in your hand and pray
[1:46:19] cuz that that listen those are
[1:46:22] handkerchiefs okay I mean we had some
[1:46:25] bed clothes that brother R prayed over
[1:46:26] and we had some of this that we prayed
[1:46:28] over and U but it it's the believing
[1:46:32] that God's going to do what his word
[1:46:33] said it was going to do okay so so you
[1:46:37] can cut a cloth off of something and and
[1:46:39] and just hold on to it and pray the
[1:46:42] prayer of faith we're not going to pray
[1:46:44] just a regular prayer we're going to
[1:46:45] pray a prayer of faith that God will
[1:46:46] move on that situation at our house and
[1:46:49] that situation at Ashley's house okay
[1:46:53] cuz cuz Ashley's got um she's got a
[1:46:56] sister Ashley's got a uh um a disease
[1:47:00] and uh if y'all have not seen her she's
[1:47:03] about as skinny as
[1:47:05] that and I know she's bothered and
[1:47:10] worried and and there seems to be a
[1:47:13] spirit following her or spirit in her
[1:47:15] house according to brother Boyd said
[1:47:17] Jeffrey had seen it in different ones
[1:47:19] but um
[1:47:20] we're going to pray listen the Bible
[1:47:23] said not only people were
[1:47:25] healed he said evil spirits
[1:47:29] left that's why we got one over these
[1:47:31] doors that's why we got one in our home
[1:47:33] that's why we got one in different
[1:47:35] places cuz I can't pray every 10 seconds
[1:47:39] two seconds but that prayer cloth can be
[1:47:41] there as a symbol for
[1:47:44] me same way Paul wasn't probably around
[1:47:48] when they cut the coats up but they they
[1:47:50] knew Paul had War them they knew there
[1:47:51] was an anointing on Paul they knew
[1:47:54] according to the Bible that there was an
[1:47:55] old man that was dead and they throw his
[1:47:58] bones in on a dead man and they jumped
[1:48:00] to life because there was life in those
[1:48:02] prophets Beyond just their regular life
[1:48:05] and they believed that so
[1:48:07] Paul they cut the they cut the things
[1:48:09] off of Paul and Paul didn't have to be
[1:48:12] there brother Brown's not here brother
[1:48:14] D's not here different ones are not here
[1:48:16] to pray but we're here we're here to
[1:48:19] pray the prayer way that these cloths
[1:48:21] are going to go in our Bibles to Psalms
[1:48:25] 23 and sister Johnny she's at home I'm
[1:48:28] sure watching now and thank you for um
[1:48:32] uh standing up for that am and we sure
[1:48:34] appreciate that appreciate them doing
[1:48:36] that but as we pray if you're at
[1:48:39] home but
[1:48:42] Danny if you're at home just get you a
[1:48:45] just get you a cloth cut you a piece off
[1:48:49] put it in in the Book of Psalms there
[1:48:52] and and just
[1:48:54] believe just believe that we're listen
[1:48:56] we're moving some we're move something's
[1:48:59] moving that's what we want we want
[1:49:01] something to move just give all them
[1:49:03] around there and when y'all get finished
[1:49:05] praying is we sure appreciate our
[1:49:07] musicians sometimes they get kind of
[1:49:08] left out in certain things but I don't
[1:49:10] want to leave them out I want them to to
[1:49:12] be able to uh to join in and and
[1:49:18] pray and let pray and let's see God
[1:49:22] move I believe he will I mean why do we
[1:49:26] come to church why do we struggle if we
[1:49:27] don't think God's not going to do
[1:49:28] anything oh yeah he might not do he
[1:49:30] might do not do what I want him to do at
[1:49:32] the time I want him to do it but he's
[1:49:33] going to do it in the time he wants to
[1:49:35] do it exactly but you know what we can
[1:49:37] do we can call on
[1:49:40] him create an atmosphere brother Brown
[1:49:42] that's what he said create an atmosphere
[1:49:44] that God can move into he ain't going to
[1:49:46] move into an Era of Confusion he's not
[1:49:49] going to move into to to us being
[1:49:52] irreverent in church and all the
[1:49:54] different things I mean I mean man you
[1:49:56] ought to go to some of these to uh
[1:49:58] denominational churches it's totally
[1:50:00] just like a lodge and I'm sorry but
[1:50:01] that's what brother rown said amen
[1:50:03] they're just talking about everything in
[1:50:05] the world and they call it Fellowship
[1:50:07] well it's just talking about the ball
[1:50:09] game and about the grocery prices being
[1:50:11] up and and good to have you and you know
[1:50:13] all this stuff but no reverence at all
[1:50:18] none just like going in sitting down
[1:50:21] hearing something you know and then
[1:50:22] going back
[1:50:24] home I didn't say it brother BR declared
[1:50:26] them
[1:50:28] lodges so they're not going to be
[1:50:30] anything but that because we believe God
[1:50:33] sent a
[1:50:35] prophet everybody got one
[1:50:37] now all right so let we're going to
[1:50:39] dismiss with this put them in your Bible
[1:50:43] let's see God work every one of you at
[1:50:45] home put this in your Bible let's see
[1:50:48] God move let's bow our heads dear
[1:50:50] heavenly
[1:50:51] father Lord I pray that what we've said
[1:50:54] tonight has been the logos of God it's
[1:50:56] been the truth and Lord as the truth
[1:50:59] Goes Forth and it lands Into the Heart
[1:51:02] of believer of a Believer then that
[1:51:04] creates a power an atmosphere of faith
[1:51:07] that they can believe that you are God
[1:51:09] and you change not you are God with a
[1:51:11] body but now you're in a body of
[1:51:13] Believers that are now with our as we
