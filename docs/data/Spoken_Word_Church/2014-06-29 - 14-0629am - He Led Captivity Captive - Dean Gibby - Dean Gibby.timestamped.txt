[8:45] heard a lot of preaching in my life and
[8:48] a lot of it's been good and most of us
[8:50] been here and uh uh but there's more to
[8:55] go to making this Rapture than just
[8:57] coming to church and going back the way
[8:59] you come come in that's like the statue
[9:02] of the perfect man it's not it it's not
[9:05] as what it seems what you're looking at
[9:09] it's a building of a body it's a
[9:12] building and and this morning by the
[9:14] grace of God I'm going to try through
[9:17] some of the things I read in the
[9:19] scriptures to show you how the statute
[9:22] of perfect man is built now you've had
[9:25] the knowledge of it you've got the
[9:26] knowledge of it then knowledge perfect
[9:29] but the knowledge alone won't do it
[9:31] that's mechanics alone so you got to
[9:34] know how you are built and I would say
[9:38] this this morning if all these
[9:42] things that's coming Upon
[9:44] Us was coming starting tomorrow would
[9:48] you be ready
[9:50] that's would you be ready that's right
[9:53] and I'm going to read a lot of by the
[9:55] grace of God let's pray father in the in
[9:59] the precious name of Jesus Christ we
[10:01] approach our throne of grace and mercy
[10:02] this morning Lord knowing father that we
[10:05] can't do one thing Lord God outside you
[10:08] but my decision Lord God my choice Lord
[10:12] God I pray has been you your leadership
[10:16] and your guiding hand you know what the
[10:19] people needs Lord God and they must see
[10:22] because you have predestinated a church
[10:25] for a certain place and to do a certain
[10:27] thing and we must see this it's once in
[10:31] the old we won't live by bread alone but
[10:34] I have a word that proceed out of the
[10:35] mouth and once in the new somebody has
[10:38] come to this and somebody is coming to
[10:41] this Lord the scripture says all things
[10:44] works together to the good to them that
[10:46] loves the Lord which are called
[10:48] according to your purpose Lord you got a
[10:51] purpose father for each individual in
[10:54] here that has a baptism of the Holy
[10:56] Ghost and I pray Lord God that it's I
[10:59] Endeavor to go on that you will bless it
[11:02] Lord God and let your servant step aside
[11:05] father and you come into this Tabernacle
[11:07] in such a way Lord God that you'll speak
[11:10] in the first person like you did the
[11:12] prophet of God one time when he you come
[11:15] to the congregation say this is not
[11:17] Willam Brandon speaking this is me
[11:20] that's what I want Lord Jesus God help
[11:23] the people now as we read the scriptures

[12:13] so I'll read them in uh a session now
[12:16] this is Paul speaking and I I want you
[12:19] to by the grace of God there's a purpose
[12:23] in this and I want you to see it oh so
[12:27] bad I was in
[12:30] my outside building yesterday late I I
[12:34] just was cutting some gray trying to
[12:36] just think about things and it started
[12:39] storming on me so I just drove into the
[12:42] outside in this metal you know how rain
[12:44] sounds on metal and it was raining so
[12:47] hard that you couldn't hear and I'm
[12:50] sitting in a chair with my head down
[12:53] thinking about the message and what God
[12:55] has done and what God is doing and God
[12:58] gave me he moved on the scene in me and
[13:00] I started screaming I believe you could
[13:02] hear me over the rain I asked Peg up at
[13:05] the house I said could you hear me I
[13:07] haven't had one like that in a long time
[13:10] and I'm going to tell you what it was
[13:12] now Brethren if I come un you speaking
[13:14] with tongues what shall I profit you now
[13:18] I'm I'm going to have to just just say
[13:21] something now if I come to you speaking
[13:24] with tongues if I come up here speaking
[13:27] a false Doctrine to you what good is it
[13:29] going to do if you don't know it I I
[13:32] could I could do this if I'm really
[13:34] smooth and and I can slide it right by
[13:38] if you ain't grounded and know that
[13:41] thing so you've got to know your
[13:44] position and what you do in that
[13:46] position and do it now Brethren if I
[13:50] come to you speaking with tongues I'm
[13:51] not talking about tongues now that's
[13:53] right what shall I profit you except
[13:56] except I shall speak unto you by
[13:59] Revelation that's what's happened here
[14:01] I'm telling you I know it's true this is
[14:04] wor I got it amen by way of this what
[14:08] shall I if I shall speak to you by
[14:10] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[14:13] prophesying or by Doctrine right we've
[14:16] had it y now do we know this or has
[14:20] somebody told us this right do we know
[14:23] personally in our soul what this is
[14:27] right or are as somebody told you do we
[14:30] know about God do we know about the
[14:32] statute of perfect man or do we see
[14:35] ourself there and how we got in there
[14:38] and what it's done to
[14:40] us we got to have that if we going to
[14:42] make a Rapture here while we're alive
[14:44] amen I'm going to try to show you the
[14:46] way I believe God has shown somebody the
[14:50] way to the
[14:52] Rapture for if the trumpet give an
[14:54] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[14:57] himself to to the battle now a trumpet
[15:01] it has to be a gospel trumpet if you
[15:03] look at the first one I don't want to
[15:05] say spend too much time here but I got
[15:07] to that's just the way I am I'm I'm
[15:09] sorry for if the gospel give an
[15:13] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[15:16] himself to battle then I and I I've up
[15:18] here right here said it has to come by
[15:20] Revelation it it come by Revelation by
[15:23] the prophecy and the knowledge that you
[15:25] get you can't come up this statute of
[15:28] perfect man without the knowledge of God
[15:30] but that knowledge of God has got to be
[15:32] revealed to you so likewise ye except
[15:36] you utter by the Tongue words easy to be
[15:40] understood how shall it be known what is
[15:42] spoken for you shall speak in through
[15:45] the air
[15:48] there I'm go on there are it may be so
[15:52] many kinds of
[15:54] voices and he could be the one sit next
[15:56] to you he could be uh uh I I could call
[15:59] names but there's no need in it I ain't
[16:02] got no argument with anybody I just want
[16:04] God here GL I just want us this is one
[16:07] he's give us a pure to take us
[16:10] through and by by the grace of God we
[16:13] ought to be able to see it right here
[16:14] and say and go home right if we was at
[16:17] this place
[16:18] amen so many kinds of voices in the
[16:21] world and none of them is without
[16:23] signification now listen therefore if I
[16:26] know not the meaning of The Voice
[16:29] right I'm trying to tell you
[16:32] something I shall be unto them that
[16:34] speaketh a barbarian now we not talking
[16:37] about with a club on your back and Claw
[16:40] skins on we talking about somebody that
[16:43] if if I speak the truth and you receive
[16:46] the truth you become the truth and do
[16:48] the truth and if somebody comes and is
[16:51] off just a little bit it's going to be
[16:53] like a barbarian
[16:55] to and he that speaketh shall be a
[16:58] barbarian to you the 1 Corinthians 14:20
[17:01] this is this is I want I said that to
[17:03] say this Brethren be not children in
[17:08] understanding how be it in Malice be ye
[17:12] children but in understanding be
[17:16] men you can be say that you can say that
[17:19] please
[17:20] am I'm going to read one more here this
[17:24] that I just uh I want to get because
[17:27] this is Paul speaking in Philippians
[17:29] 4:11 I just read I don't know if he can
[17:32] get it up or not but I I I'll read it to
[17:34] you I want you to listen
[17:36] close cuz this has got a lot to do with
[17:39] the statute of perfect man the have you
[17:42] ever thought that at
[17:44] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost come now
[17:47] I'm going to show you something in the
[17:49] writings of the quotes that I got here
[17:51] but now when when they was in the upper
[17:54] room and the Holy Ghost come down and
[17:58] gave them them a revelation anointed
[17:59] them and gave them a revelation the
[18:01] faith of the fathers how much suffering
[18:03] did you think they done had already done
[18:05] I'm I'm serious now how much but I tell
[18:08] you what when they received it they went
[18:10] forth and it all come to pass he even
[18:13] told Peter how he would
[18:14] die God sisters and brothers is want to
[18:18] speak to you mouth to ear he's want to
[18:21] become so Supernatural to you that you
[18:24] can call him and he'll he'll come and
[18:27] speak to you he says that without the
[18:30] supernatural God in the church which is
[18:33] the divine
[18:34] revelation and it it's what good is it
[18:38] he said we don't have faith for divine H
[18:40] let alone rapturing Faith but something
[18:42] will come and I'm declaring it is here
[18:45] if I hear a preacher
[18:47] preach and I don't hear the son of man
[18:50] come out of his mouth I have a problem
[18:53] amen because he say he to come in three
[18:56] times he's to come his son of son of man
[18:58] Son of God Son of David and in the end
[19:01] time he's to come as a son of man again
[19:04] God in human flesh again in me and you
[19:06] he said he come in flesh and then when
[19:09] we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:12] we receive the word in our flesh why is
[19:15] he always talking about mortify the
[19:16] Deeds of the Flesh and all why is he
[19:18] always talking about these things he
[19:21] died in the flesh that we don't have to
[19:22] live in the flesh but oh well I can't
[19:25] help it come on okay not that I speak in
[19:29] respect of want for I for I have learned
[19:33] in whatsoever soever State I
[19:36] am there with to be
[19:40] content Oh What A M
[19:42] fo and this brother God if you would
[19:45] read the scriptures for yourself instead
[19:48] of somebody having to read it for you
[19:51] right and see get it firsthand he been
[19:54] read to you time and time and time and
[19:57] time again and see see I find that that
[19:59] don't
[20:01] resonate it resonates but when you read
[20:04] that comes on the scene right you got to
[20:08] have it
[20:09] yeah for I know both how to be a
[20:13] based and I know how to
[20:17] abound everywhere and in all things I am
[20:20] instructed both to be full and to be
[20:23] hungry both to abound and to suffer
[20:27] needs
[20:29] okay I'm going to read this right here
[20:31] because really if if if if uh this is
[20:35] going to be the last this is in
[20:38] countdown page 19 paragraph
[20:41] 96 and any
[20:44] man we're predestinated to this church
[20:47] sure you and I amen God through listen
[20:51] if we can't see this happening are we
[20:53] predestinated this is I'm asking
[20:55] questions I'm asking questions to try
[20:58] yourself and see if you be in the faith
[21:00] I'm asking questions you qu every time
[21:04] I've ever done this right here people's
[21:05] left me every time I start laying it
[21:08] back he putting it out and making you
[21:10] question yourself yeah you must question
[21:13] yourself you must question daily hourly
[21:17] you question yourself how would you how
[21:19] would you if if if he coming like a
[21:22] thief in the night not a thief but like
[21:25] a thief in the night and he's going to
[21:27] take his out of here cuz he said if 500

[24:21] said hold it right there brother gab I
[24:23] said hold it it's back up a minute I
[24:25] said do you know what happened mhm I
[24:28] said do you know what happened there
[24:30] sure I says you actually was defying
[24:35] Satan and going beyond your sense is
[24:39] what you felt see God will do it and you
[24:41] don't even know it's done
[24:44] right amen God please help us
[24:47] Lord okay praise God now I want to uh I
[24:51] want to say something here just read
[24:54] this is the first is the church age book
[24:56] and I I ask some people
[24:58] uh long ago years ago we was down in the
[25:00] in the basement in there in the
[25:02] fellowship hall and a bunch of Skies was
[25:05] around and I I don't know why I did it
[25:08] but I I do I do know now more so I says
[25:14] when you read the church age
[25:16] book can you see the Thunders sure
[25:20] nobody said a
[25:21] word can I ask you today with all that
[25:25] you read and when you read the church
[25:27] age book can you see them thunders in
[25:29] there that is his coming he is coming
[25:33] the son of man is coming that's what I
[25:34] said about it now a man a preacher can
[25:37] preach on the on the son of man Ministry
[25:39] and maybe never mentioned absolutely the
[25:41] son of man right cuz he's preaching them
[25:43] Thunders see and it's the life he said
[25:46] listen in Christ mystery of God revealed
[25:49] he says now the bride is part of the
[25:52] mystery and must be revealed right and
[25:56] this I I say it's a plan that he had in
[26:00] his mind before there was ever world
[26:02] that he was going to achieve he was
[26:03] going to have a bride down here that
[26:05] wasn't going to take what the first Eve
[26:07] turned down that's right she and she's
[26:09] going to come to where Eve would have
[26:11] come
[26:12] to eternal life in a changed body right
[26:15] here without dying she would eventually
[26:18] came to it cuz brother am said she would
[26:20] have had the child eventually had the
[26:22] child I mean do you understand that
[26:24] that's just simple simple simple simple
[26:27] things now I want to read this because
[26:28] it's the first I just I want you to
[26:30] think of this and maybe he'll go make
[26:33] you go back and read yourself and ask
[26:35] some questions about it and talk to God
[26:39] about it and because there's things
[26:41] coming on us church and we must be ready
[26:46] and if we're not
[26:47] ready maybe we wasn't predestinated yeah
[26:51] we can find out here and know right here
[26:54] right here whether we are gods or or not
[26:58] right
[26:59] right and we can't stay if we had a new
[27:02] birth we can't stay babies cuz he said
[27:04] in first I got it wrote down here
[27:06] somewhere
[27:09] uh he says in 1 Corinthians he says when
[27:12] that which is perfect has come then that
[27:14] which is a part shall be done away it
[27:16] don't mean you do away with the word you
[27:18] receive but it comes in perfect form see
[27:22] he says uh when I was a child I
[27:24] understood as a child but when I became
[27:27] a man I'm back over here where Paul says
[27:30] he says Brethren be not children in
[27:33] understanding but how be it in my
[27:35] children but in understanding be
[27:40] men as though I I would say but when I
[27:44] become a man I put away childish things
[27:47] let's put away childish things our own
[27:50] thinking right what we know and don't
[27:53] know we might not know and we might not
[27:56] know I'm telling you we got to be sure
[27:59] we got to have perfect understanding
[28:03] personally not for somebody else but for
[28:05] you you got to have perfect
[28:09] understanding perfect Revelation I got
[28:12] it all in here my notes I ever get to
[28:16] them okay this is
[28:18] Introduction uh in a church age book
[28:21] through the he starting through this
[28:24] volume though this volume will concern
[28:26] itself with various major doctrines such
[28:29] as the godhead water baptism found in
[28:32] Revelation 1 through3 his main theme is
[28:36] setting forth of a detailed study of the
[28:39] seven Church ages he's coming he com in
[28:43] he come I'm I'm going to read something
[28:45] here see if if if it it'll grab you yeah
[28:48] now this is necessary in order to study
[28:51] and understand the rest of the
[28:54] Revelation right for out of the agan J
[28:57] comes to seal us
[28:59] right remember we receive everything
[29:03] that they had all the way from calary
[29:05] you and I are predestinated by almighty
[29:09] God to receive everything and when we
[29:13] receive everything we receive the full
[29:15] combat Beast right amen
[29:18] exactly and they do their work in us
[29:22] that they've never been able to complete
[29:25] in nobody before and we sat here as a
[29:28] small group well it ain't small to me I
[29:31] preach to four or five yeah I'll preach
[29:34] to one I I well it doesn't make it 100
[29:37] or 200 it doesn't make any difference to
[29:39] me I'm the same kind of
[29:42] Minister out of the ages comes the seals
[29:45] that's see if you understand this and
[29:47] out of the seals come the
[29:50] trumpets and out of the trumpets Comes
[29:52] The Vows like the first burst of a Roman
[29:55] Candle the church ages bring forth would
[29:57] have Mighty and initial illumination
[30:00] without which there could be no further
[30:03] light you see what I'm trying to say I I
[30:07] pray God that he'll let you see what
[30:10] he's letting me see but once the briance
[30:13] of the seven Church ages is given by
[30:16] divine revelation light upon light
[30:20] follows until the whole of the
[30:22] Revelation opens wide before our
[30:25] wondering eyes that's right amen and and
[30:27] we edified and purified by his Spirit
[30:29] are made ready for his glorious
[30:32] appearing even our Lord and savior the
[30:34] one true and God Jesus Christ they they
[30:36] said this in the church e right now we
[30:40] know we where we finished it in'
[30:42] 65
[30:47] okay let's see I had this uh I'm going
[30:53] to have to rear rearrange he's here I
[30:55] give him to Jose they put him back back
[30:57] in the numbers and I had my numbers
[31:01] crooked
[31:06] okay okay let me just read this page
[31:09] seven Joseph
[31:11] um right now page seven uh
[31:17] 153 now this is for very familiar very
[31:20] famili but but there's words in here
[31:25] that needs to be pointed out to the
[31:27] predestinated seat of God oh yeah
[31:30] there's different kinds of Ministries is
[31:32] what I'm trying to tell you Church we're
[31:33] all we're not all the same we all got
[31:36] the same God and we comeing toward the
[31:38] same point but it's different ways of
[31:41] ministering right okay is it on
[31:46] there well I said on page on page
[31:49] seven
[31:51] okay okay now a revelation of Jesus
[31:54] Christ Church age book one now remember
[31:56] this Christ in the true church is a
[31:58] continuation of the book of Acts can you
[32:00] can you say that right amen can ever I I
[32:04] I would like to ask everybody you you
[32:05] don't have to mention but praise God for
[32:08] the ones that does Amen if you're not
[32:10] sure you better get sure right right
[32:14] amen you better get sure Glory it's time
[32:16] for games it's it's it's it's time for
[32:20] quit playing church it's going to it's
[32:23] it's fixing a hit it's already here I
[32:26] mean no was in the ARK for seven days
[32:28] before the rain came and the third pull
[32:30] was really working in buddy it went it
[32:32] went into it okay now remember this
[32:35] Christ in the church in his continuation
[32:37] of the book of Acts but the Book of
[32:39] Revelation shows how the Antichrist
[32:41] Spirit would come into the church yes
[32:44] sir and defile it make it in lukewarm
[32:47] formal and Powerless and most people's
[32:50] minds goes to denominational churches
[32:52] we're not fooling with denominational
[32:54] churches they're dead as door knobs
[32:57] we're talking about the people that says
[32:59] they follow this
[33:00] message and and if if you was not had
[33:04] not been Versed and heard about the
[33:08] doctrine of uh he wasn't god Till The
[33:10] River Jordan you would have went with
[33:12] that
[33:13] thing but God has blessed us and he has
[33:16] G us a word that we can hold to but it
[33:19] can't be just in memory form right amen
[33:24] right it exposes
[33:27] revealing his Works attempting
[33:30] destruction see this you take in
[33:32] Deuteronomy 13 that me and brother D
[33:34] both likes a lot if a dreamer or a
[33:38] prophet brings you to them and tells you
[33:40] that it's going to happen and it happens
[33:42] and takes you to another God right
[33:45] that's and you've got to see the next
[33:47] one he said these are to prove you and
[33:49] see if you going to stay with the
[33:51] Revelation you have and if you don't
[33:53] have no Revelation guess what it can
[33:55] even show you you name was not on the
[33:58] Lamb's Book of
[33:59] Life amen exactly
[34:04] right an attempted destruction of God's
[34:07] people and discrediting God's word right
[34:10] down to the time he is cast into the
[34:12] Lake of Fire he fights it and he fights
[34:14] it but I'm telling you Church God's got
[34:17] a bride on the face of this earth now
[34:19] that's that that St statute of perfect
[34:21] man is so wrapped from the inside to the
[34:24] outside and in the virtues of God until
[34:28] Satan is not going to be able to
[34:30] penetrate that when we stand there
[34:32] before the change I don't mean he ain't
[34:35] going to keep bounding you hitting you
[34:37] but he ain't going to be able to
[34:39] penetrate I don't believe it he said
[34:41] limbs would be restored right amen he
[34:44] cannot stand he knows that if the people
[34:46] get the true revelation of the true
[34:48] church and what she is what she stands
[34:50] for and what she can do the Greater
[34:52] Works she will be an invincible Army and
[34:56] only in
[34:57] I pray God he'll let me get a few of
[34:59] these things out so you can see how that
[35:02] statute of a perfect man is put together
[35:06] it's not just in the teaching of the
[35:08] knowledge of the word there's people
[35:10] that can take that right and and and
[35:13] teach it boy and be a
[35:16] hypocrite you believe that so close to
[35:19] deceive the elected that's right there
[35:21] ain't no hypocrite here though I'll tell
[35:23] you I believe that if I didn't believe
[35:26] it I would say it right if they get a
[35:29] true Revelation the two Spirits within
[35:31] the framework of the Christian
[35:33] church can you do that can you say that
[35:36] can I say that right can you can you can
[35:40] you discern the spirits if it's a
[35:42] denomination you don't have no
[35:44] trouble but what about somebody that
[35:46] comes up here so close that it would
[35:48] deceive the elected you need a
[35:50] revelation that you can discern that and
[35:52] withstand that right you got to do it
[35:56] sister losing it's got to happen amen
[36:00] that's right and by God's spirit discern
[36:03] and withand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[36:06] will be powerless before her he would be
[36:09] as definitely toward today as when
[36:11] Christ with stood his his every effort
[36:13] to get pain uh gain power over him in
[36:16] the desert yes Satan hates the
[36:18] Revelation but we love it with true
[36:20] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[36:23] Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[36:25] will prevail over them right
[36:27] now I'm going to read this bottom
[36:29] here Catch My
[36:31] Breath oh I love this Lord I love it God
[36:35] if I had to walk along this is what
[36:38] would be in my hand and it's because
[36:40] it's in my heart but Wade you will
[36:42] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[36:44] of this message now I could go back that
[36:47] this book we are studying is the actual
[36:50] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[36:52] church and in the church and his work is
[36:55] in the future ages I said Through the
[36:57] Ages is his coming cuz he said he said a
[37:02] gospel let me get in here to it oh I
[37:05] ain't forgot then I mentioned that it
[37:06] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[37:08] Revelation or will fail to get bringing
[37:10] these two thoughts together you will see
[37:12] that it won't just take ordinary
[37:15] study thinking to make this book real it
[37:18] is going to take the operation of the
[37:21] Holy
[37:23] Ghost if you ain't got Revelation how
[37:25] can you have the oper ation I mean of of
[37:28] the Holy Ghost how can you if you don't
[37:30] even have the Holy Spirit if you're not
[37:32] learning if this is what a new birth is
[37:36] a new birth comes into you it's a birth
[37:38] of the word to bring you it's not being
[37:41] complacent not just coming to church now
[37:43] just listen to to your husband or your
[37:46] wife or whatever and and expect to get
[37:48] it amen exactly it's something listen
[37:51] when they when joshu took them over the
[37:54] river and to place them in the land they
[37:57] fought for every inch of ground they had
[38:00] and they took right it's not easy but
[38:04] without desperation you won't even try
[38:08] right we'll come to church we have a
[38:12] good time we hear a great message but
[38:14] are you did you really receive the
[38:16] message right did if you did you'll go
[38:19] and act on
[38:21] it please
[38:23] God oh Lord it is going to take the
[38:27] operation of the Holy Ghost this book
[38:28] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[38:30] special class of people he will take one
[38:32] more prophetic Insight it now people say
[38:35] that's a private and it was it would
[38:38] require the ability to hear from God now
[38:41] listen it would require Supernatural
[38:43] instruction not just a student comparing
[38:46] verse to a verse a student now he's done
[38:49] brought us in though that is good but a
[38:53] mystery requires the teaching of the
[38:56] spirit or it never becomes clear how we
[38:59] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[39:02] open and become yielded to the spirit to
[39:05] hear and
[39:08] know okay let me let me say this right
[39:12] here this is on uh page four uh Brother
[39:15] Joseph uh
[39:17] 116 D2 what that
[39:20] means do we uh I I ask you do we really
[39:24] know we know what the definition of
[39:27] election is sure we know what Webster
[39:30] said the definition of web brother Brown
[39:33] made a statement one time people was boy
[39:35] they was explaining the words and all he
[39:37] says we got people that thinks they in
[39:40] the room would Webster yeah see
[39:44] sometimes you don't get
[39:46] Revelation from Webster you don't get
[39:49] Revelation from the uh strong
[39:52] concordance sometimes it takes God to
[39:55] break that down and show you what it
[39:59] is and this is what I'm trying to say it
[40:02] takes the Holy Ghost In You And if you
[40:05] ain't got the Holy Ghost you better get
[40:08] desperate CU it could be right up to the
[40:11] door Noah he could be right up to the do
[40:14] door of sodon cuz he'll be here and you
[40:17] won't know it you'll be caught yes right
[40:20] that's right warning then judgment he
[40:23] preached a message on that warning then
[40:25] judgment and it's been a big part of my
[40:28] Ministry I've tried to warn people I've
[40:31] tried to tell them what God Said just
[40:33] like brother Dale Faith come by here I
[40:35] am so grateful to God that God placed a
[40:39] man in my life and now men and my life
[40:44] that spoke a word that went in I
[40:47] accepted it it come down into my soul
[40:49] God give me Revelation and brought it
[40:51] back up and stamp my brain and come out
[40:54] my ears and through my spirit real and
[40:56] into my body and here I stand I'm so
[40:59] grateful to God by election he chooses
[41:03] you see if you see election you going
[41:06] back in the back part of God's mind
[41:08] before there was
[41:09] anything yes sir you'll see how God can
[41:12] create a a people in the world and not
[41:15] make any of them make any decision but
[41:18] he knowed the ones that would make it
[41:20] for him so all these things we come into
[41:23] this world shaped in iniquity come in
[41:27] the world speaking lies he's seen all
[41:30] that he's he saw even and Adam he's seen
[41:33] it all but he's seen where you was
[41:35] coming right and he was able to make you
[41:37] white so he said many of those that's
[41:40] really been bad yeah he said but not now
[41:44] right brother D brought that out years
[41:46] ago is I've held it in my heart ever
[41:48] since because it was me
[41:51] amen God if if I hadn't if I hadn't when
[41:54] I met my wife I don't know where we
[41:57] would go but God started changing me I
[42:00] mean I I I listen I say and talk to you
[42:03] all day about God pointing things out to
[42:06] me pointing things out to me pointing
[42:08] things out to me and I would obey I
[42:10] would obey I would obey until the day
[42:13] God next to God I love her the most yeah
[42:16] amen sure I mean God Amen I won't get in
[42:19] that when I get to cry go ahead
[42:21] yesterday was our
[42:22] anniversary we 37 years
[42:29] Hallelujah you see this is Smur Church
[42:32] age chapter 4 you see they could not
[42:35] figure out God's
[42:36] love now this is something they could
[42:39] not figure out God's love who is
[42:42] they somebody is figured out God's love
[42:45] brother because they have the baptism of
[42:46] the Holy Ghost Brother Sam somebody
[42:49] knows about God's love and they know
[42:52] that God he
[42:54] said by
[42:57] election through
[42:58] knowledge predestination Destiny so I I
[43:03] have to see that I am elected of God I
[43:07] see this cuz I know the say they could
[43:09] not figure out God love but I figured it
[43:11] out by Revelation I ain't just figured
[43:14] it because you can't figure God but by
[43:16] Revelation he shown me that I am his own
[43:19] elected and he showed me where it come
[43:22] from the baptism of the Holy Ghost me if
[43:24] I found no knowledge in me when our
[43:26] faith come by here and it come in my
[43:28] mind I accepted it went down in there he
[43:30] revealed it it will come back it come
[43:32] back into my spirit real into my body
[43:35] real right I want you to take that one
[43:38] to the bank that's the way it
[43:41] works absolutely they thought that love
[43:44] meant no suffering I'm getting down F to
[43:47] get to it there they thought that love
[43:48] meant a baby with parental care but God
[43:51] said that his love was elective love the
[43:55] prove of his love love is election that
[43:57] no matter what happened his love was
[44:00] proven truly the fact that they were
[44:03] chosen to Salvation because God has
[44:05] chosen you to Salvation through
[44:08] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[44:10] of the truth he may commit you to death
[44:14] as he did Paul exactly and remember Paul
[44:17] wrote 14 books in the New Testament he
[44:18] of course he had to die because he he
[44:20] would have got old and died anyway he
[44:22] may commit you to suffering as he did
[44:25] job right
[44:28] God I his I want to go I I see something
[44:31] I want to go too but that is his
[44:34] prerogative he is Sovereign but it is
[44:37] all with a purpose so can't nothing
[44:41] happen to a son or daughter of God that
[44:45] it ain't the purpose of God I've heard
[44:47] brother Dale get up here and say that
[44:50] and brother Wade I've heard the ministry
[44:52] see I'm telling you nothing can happen
[44:55] to you and he took me
[44:58] forever to say that some of us has had
[45:03] more see Paul got a quick headcut job
[45:08] had went all the way through with them
[45:09] balls on him brother I just read what
[45:11] brother Brown said them balls he said
[45:12] now he's talking about ezekiah he said
[45:14] he had a boil said it was a cancer now I
[45:17] don't know if job what what he had but I
[45:20] know it was about a year they say I
[45:22] don't know how they know this thing but
[45:24] he stayed true to
[45:27] God testified at the beginning who he
[45:29] was and testified to the end says you
[45:32] you friends of job he says you've been
[45:35] wrong I heard what you say them lying
[45:38] preachers and that's what it was cuz
[45:40] they was deceived they was telling them
[45:41] wrong he said you go have job pray for
[45:44] you and burn to give his sacrifices and
[45:48] job's captivity was still on him but
[45:51] when he prayed right that's it his
[45:54] captivity was taken off of so it was a
[45:56] time like we we need to see these
[45:59] things but it was all with a purpose if
[46:02] he did not have a purpose then he would
[46:04] be the author of frustration not a peace
[46:06] his purpose is that after we have
[46:08] suffered a while we would be made
[46:10] perfect established strength and settled
[46:12] and job said he put strength in US job
[46:15] 23:6 you see he himself suffered he
[46:18] learned obedience by the things that he
[46:21] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[46:23] the things that he suffered
[46:26] I'm pointing that statute that is not a
[46:28] drawing on a wall that is you that is me
[46:34] that is that is Psalms
[46:37] 23 that is Daniel 9:24 right there there
[46:42] it is right there there is in the finish
[46:45] of it is revelation 10 through 7 and it
[46:48] goes to Revelation 5 right I it's there
[46:52] amen sir if I see it you can see it amen
[46:55] you get desperate before God say if he
[46:57] won't show it to you oh yeah exactly the
[47:01] thing Hebrews 589 though were he were a
[47:04] son yet learn he obedience by the things
[47:06] which he suffered and being made perfect
[47:08] he became the author of Eternal
[47:09] salvation all that obey him in plain
[47:12] language the very character of Jesus was
[47:14] perfected through suffering and
[47:17] according to Paul he has left his church
[47:19] a measure of suffering that they too by
[47:21] faith in God while suffering from him
[47:23] would be coming to a place of
[47:26] Perfection why did he want this James 1
[47:29] 2 2 and 4 my brethren count it all joy
[47:32] when you fall into divers Temptation
[47:34] knowing this that the TR of your faith
[47:36] worth your patience but let patience
[47:38] have heard perfect word that you may be
[47:40] perfect in entire wanting nothing listen
[47:43] you have to walk in this you have to
[47:46] walk by this I mean you if you going to
[47:49] be in the image of
[47:51] God without a smell of sin on you you
[47:55] are are a different people you are the
[47:58] caliber of Caleb and Joshua am which was
[48:02] a type of what we fulfill right
[48:05] amen
[48:07] okay this is on page five Brother
[48:11] Joseph uh
[48:13] 117
[48:16] one say why does he stand by the reason
[48:20] is in Romans 8:17 and18 and if children
[48:24] then HS with God
[48:26] and join ours with Christ now listen
[48:28] every word is read if so be that we
[48:31] suffer with him that we may be also
[48:34] glorified together now suffering could
[48:36] be sickness hospitals uh afflictions
[48:40] anything but God himself is here to
[48:42] deliver you and me amen I believe this I
[48:46] believe this we played around long
[48:49] enough right we need to call for god
[48:53] brother BR said I could be in in the
[48:55] back and studying and praying a land
[48:57] before God come out anointing and the
[49:00] people wasn't in the same anointing it
[49:01] wouldn't do no good and I know how much
[49:04] the ministry here has seen that right
[49:06] here right amen say here nonchalant come
[49:10] in here with all kind of spirits on us
[49:12] right expecting to hear from God God
[49:16] don't answer any stuff like that though
[49:18] the word is perfect right he goes right
[49:20] over you remember them two Cadillacs he
[49:23] looks like one right they look just
[49:26] alike but it look like one you there's
[49:29] one he said never congregation Believers
[49:31] make Believers and unbelievers always
[49:33] would be you got to make sure you're not
[49:35] one of those unbelievers in that
[49:37] Cadillac that looks like the real thing
[49:40] you've got to know this thank you Lord
[49:43] you say how can we know this well let's
[49:45] just
[49:47] read the sufferings of this present time
[49:49] are not worthy to be compared with the
[49:51] glory which shall be revealed in usless
[49:53] we suffer with him we cannot reign with
[49:55] with him you have to suffer to rain the
[49:59] reason for this is that character simply
[50:02] is never made what I suffer now I know I
[50:06] ain't going to have time to do it right
[50:08] there but see that is a person that's
[50:11] come to God like he said the Lord is my
[50:14] shepherd right he somebody said the Lord
[50:17] is my shepherd He know he had been
[50:19] Justified and Sanctified and he has
[50:22] received his sh the she the shepherd He
[50:25] said he leades me or or let make me lie
[50:28] down in green pasture he put me into
[50:30] this word right right here in green
[50:33] pasture he leades me beside the Still
[50:35] Water he give me the revelation of
[50:38] it oh Lord he said oh God I just I I
[50:42] need to let me see
[50:45] this he maketh me to lie in in Green
[50:48] Pastures he leadth meide the Ste Waters
[50:50] he restores my soul he justified
[50:53] Sanctified fill me with the baptism of
[50:54] Holy Ghost listen he he leadth me in the
[50:58] path of righteousness for his name's
[51:00] sake and then he says this yay though I
[51:02] walk through the valley of the shelter
[51:04] of death see but I've got you prepared
[51:06] my child I've got you I've got you I've
[51:09] got you back as they say I've got you I
[51:12] don't know to have your back but I got
[51:14] you insides in front too amen I mean and
[51:17] then look here he he prepared a table
[51:20] before me in the presence of my enemy he
[51:22] give me that that statue of the perfect
[51:24] man he he bring this and bring and made
[51:27] it alive in my soul and it ready out
[51:30] through my
[51:31] body somebody God is dealing with and
[51:36] must know the way to the Rapture or the
[51:39] way to get there right he says he
[51:42] anointed my head with oil right that's
[51:45] your headship yes
[51:47] sir he anoints my my oh just running all
[51:51] over me you go to F of slams with that
[51:54] you wanted to see which was a type he
[51:58] said I will dwell in the house of the
[52:00] Lord forever and this is the house of
[52:03] the
[52:04] Lord
[52:05] okay because because power apart from
[52:08] character is satanic but Power with
[52:10] character is fit to rule see I mean it
[52:13] everything fits now and since he wants
[52:15] us to share even his throne on the same
[52:18] basis that he overcame and sat down in
[52:21] his father's Throne then we have to
[52:24] overcome to sit with him
[52:25] right I mean it's a simple talking about
[52:29] Brother D said he's so he's so deep you
[52:32] need a
[52:33] revelation he's just he he's right in
[52:35] his word you you tell me where he ain't
[52:39] been in his word
[52:41] on right you just don't have no
[52:43] Revelation you just come up here and
[52:46] this is what people does they hear a
[52:48] sermon and and absolutely you could ask
[52:50] him outside that door what he preaching
[52:52] most of them won't have a clue no right
[52:56] now if I'm wrong you're right y'all can
[52:58] get me when I get
[53:00] outside he overcame and sat down in his
[53:03] father's Throne see right he come as son
[53:06] of man and he come back as Son of God
[53:09] right position he was taken but he's
[53:11] here now as the son of man amen we V we
[53:14] to vindicate Luke 17:30 when the son of
[53:17] man is being revealed we we are called
[53:20] for this church amen do we see it that's
[53:23] right if we don't it's time to get
[53:26] desperate these altar ought to be full
[53:29] of screaming and Hauling and praying and
[53:32] begging
[53:33] God but if you're all secure in where
[53:36] you're at praise God praise God I'm just
[53:41] give you I'm listen I'm just doing what
[53:43] God's told me to do and if you don't
[53:46] want it right you don't have to take it
[53:48] that's right this is this is how God
[53:50] told me to do it I got it lined up here
[53:53] that I'm doing it then we have to
[53:55] overcome to sit with him and a little
[53:57] temporary suff we go through that not
[53:59] worthy to be compared with tremendous
[54:00] Victory we have with him it's okay than
[54:03] it not strange concerning the Fier
[54:05] trials that are try you this is what
[54:07] Peter said it is it strange that God
[54:09] wants us to develop a Christlike
[54:11] character that comes through suffering
[54:14] yeah we don't have suffering just right
[54:18] maybe because a lot of us ain't come
[54:20] through but see some of us has come
[54:22] through things that we can tell others
[54:24] and we are testimony before the
[54:27] people I I I think of myself brother you
[54:30] you up here talking about uh the dead
[54:32] being raised and all see I know it I've
[54:34] had it to happen three times in my life
[54:38] and me involved
[54:40] in you trying to make something no I'm
[54:43] trying to tell you the truth I've got
[54:45] something else if if piggy will warn me
[54:47] and give me time to do it I got some
[54:48] rainbows I want to show you no sir we
[54:51] have trial we all have trials we are all
[54:54] chased a Sons with not one go but goes
[54:56] through that the church is not Serv is
[54:59] not being tried hasn't got it it isn't
[55:01] of Hebrews 12:6 for whom the Lord love
[55:04] he chasing and Scourge every son he
[55:05] receiveth but if ye be without
[55:07] chastisement where of all partakers in
[55:09] you are bastards and not son now this is
[55:12] a special condition in Smyrna must be
[55:15] applied to every age there is no age
[55:18] free from it there is no True Believer
[55:20] free from it this is of god this is the
[55:23] will of God it is needful we need to
[55:25] Lord to teach us the truth that we are
[55:28] to suffer and be Christlike in doing it
[55:31] love suffer long is kind Matthew 5 11:12
[55:35] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[55:38] and persecute you and shall allow all
[55:39] manner of evil against you falsely and
[55:41] for my sake be rejoice and be
[55:43] exceedingly glad for Great Is Your Word
[55:45] in heaven so pers there to Prophet
[55:47] before you we want to fight him yeah we
[55:51] don't want to surrender to God like God
[55:53] surrendered to the Cross he surren there
[55:55] he made his final surrender in
[55:57] Gethsemane and obedient to the cross for
[56:00] you and me am yes sir

[56:50] from her husband if she had have stayed
[56:53] with her husband she wouldn't have been
[56:54] in there and they're talking to the
[56:56] Beast and Paul tells us what to do about
[56:59] this but do we see
[57:01] this you need to a husband and a wife
[57:04] needs to stay together yes I mean and
[57:08] and and consult each other in everything

[57:23] herself and and and listen it's a I say
[57:27] I will I I will say again I love her
[57:30] next to God more than anything God gave
[57:33] her to me to keep me in line that's
[57:39] right the cloudy skies and storms of
[57:42] life are no signs of God's disapproval
[57:45] neither are bright skies and Still
[57:47] Waters signs of his love and approval
[57:49] amen God we need to we need we need to
[57:53] know these things we must know these
[57:56] things his approval of any of us is only
[58:00] in the Beloved
[58:03] election
[58:04] election his love is elected which he
[58:07] had for us before the foundation of
[58:09] world does he love us oh yes but how
[58:12] shall we know we know because he said so
[58:15] that's right and listen so he said so
[58:17] that's it you don't have to do nothing
[58:20] else you already got it no sir they fall
[58:24] forever inch of ground they
[58:26] took and so made manifest that he did
[58:29] love us for he brought us to
[58:32] himself himself and gave us of his
[58:34] Spirit placing us as sons and how shall
[58:37] I prove my love for him oh yes Lord by
[58:40] believing what he said and by conducting
[58:43] myself with joy amidst the trials right
[58:47] if you can keep that in your mind and in
[58:50] your soul when these decisions and
[58:53] choices you have to make make it'll help
[58:56] you
[58:59] amen that he in his wisdom allowed to
[59:02] come to P I know that property see but
[59:05] they are rich there it is again so you
[59:08] have to be careful it's got nice homes
[59:10] you know and got got God's blessed you
[59:12] and gives you you better be careful how
[59:14] you handle that
[59:16] right now the sister there at
[59:19] Blasphemous names brother BR said God
[59:21] accepted her because she helped the
[59:24] Brethren she would bring them in and all
[59:26] that and God accepted her Holy Ghost she
[59:28] was doubting where she had the Holy
[59:30] Ghost she was seeking to know where she
[59:32] had the Holy
[59:33] Ghost see it's in the books and
[59:36] tapes he said rapturing faith lies in
[59:38] these books and tapes amen and and when
[59:41] somebody can bring it out of these books
[59:43] and tapes you better listen it just
[59:45] might be God speaking in the first
[59:48] person and I personally think it is
[59:51] because that that's the way God called
[59:52] he predestinated five-fold Ministry from
[59:55] the beginning he knew us he knew the
[59:57] prophet's brother he predestinated him
[1:00:00] right and so he know all you
[1:00:03] right like a father he is looking down
[1:00:06] upon his family he is the head of his
[1:00:08] household he a he is a provider yeah he
[1:00:11] believes see oh how the untutored
[1:00:14] believer stumbles at this how can God
[1:00:17] bear to look upon his own in a time of
[1:00:19] need and not just stop it all just give
[1:00:21] it and Lish everything every material
[1:00:23] upon them but because I got to wrote
[1:00:25] there because God knows what we have
[1:00:27] need and let us prove we are Sons and
[1:00:31] Daughters of God we stand upon his
[1:00:33] Revelation this they're all
[1:00:36] along see if he he said he wants to heal
[1:00:39] us more than we want to be healed I said
[1:00:41] try that one on when you got diabetes
[1:00:43] for 45 years try it on like brother dick
[1:00:46] there had had had postrate cancer no
[1:00:51] more try it on try it on he's able to
[1:00:54] talk to people about things like this by
[1:00:57] experience but he has to bring God on
[1:01:00] the scene not just a natural
[1:01:03] thing yeah let's move
[1:01:07] along
[1:01:08] okay I want to read you something here

[1:01:49] where the six seal was open brother
[1:01:51] brandham said here just for a moment God
[1:01:54] was in Plain Sight God now see only God
[1:01:58] through the through Calvary the shedding
[1:02:00] of his blood the resurrection could
[1:02:03] release the life remember the seal was
[1:02:05] broken what the spirit went into his
[1:02:07] heart to release the life yeah I got a
[1:02:10] live up there but y'all have to get on
[1:02:12] the Peggy about that now watch the

[1:06:15] been the calvary I've made the atonement
[1:06:17] he atonement for you that's why your
[1:06:20] bodies has been released from prison
[1:06:23] yeah
[1:06:24] from captivity and I the almighty God
[1:06:28] have captured you you're
[1:06:31] mine and that's what he does to you sis

[1:06:36] Captivity that we were in he released
[1:06:39] from the soul and he come in and give us
[1:06:42] eternal life immortality in the soul but
[1:06:44] our bodies is still working to really
[1:06:47] because he come in the flesh that when
[1:06:49] he came into us his word could come in
[1:06:51] our flesh but it will not be completely
[1:06:54] totally released from that until the
[1:06:56] change of the body and then the prisoner

[1:14:05] don't know I'm tell you bright lights in
[1:14:08] the top of the trees and that was in
[1:14:11] Amber and there was an Amber glue that
[1:14:12] filled the rooms he started toward the
[1:14:14] Sund deck door and said come here piggy
[1:14:16] I want you to see this outside the whole
[1:14:18] backyard area cluding our house was
[1:14:21] covered in Ember glow shortly after we
[1:14:24] went back into the house I received a
[1:14:26] text from my neighbor across the street
[1:14:28] the text said that there was a beautiful
[1:14:29] rainbow over the top of our house and
[1:14:31] they took pictures of it we rushed out
[1:14:33] to the front yard we saw only a portion
[1:14:35] of rainbow I saw I called the neighbor
[1:14:37] and asked her if she could uh if we
[1:14:40] could see the pictures she said her
[1:14:42] husband took them with his cell phone
[1:14:44] and she would have him forward them to
[1:14:46] us another neighbor helped me helped me
[1:14:49] get the pictures on the computer so we
[1:14:51] could make prints so I just wrote that
[1:14:53] down but what I'm saying is God is
[1:14:58] moving amen he's fixing he he's fixing
[1:15:00] to do something he is doing something
[1:15:03] now we can we can go to uh uh conduct
[1:15:07] order and Doctrine book
[1:15:08] 145 he said give me a church full of the
[1:15:11] Holy Ghost right God do in a year what
[1:15:13] theologians fail to do in 2,000 years he
[1:15:16] said when the last Gentile comes in
[1:15:18] right God would known the church then
[1:15:21] but now listen something brought brought
[1:15:23] that about and I believe that I'm a part
[1:15:26] of what I've talked about today to bring
[1:15:29] that to bring us to a place that we are
[1:15:31] so wrapped in the virtues of God and so
[1:15:35] wrapped in the whole armor of God that
[1:15:37] he is not going to be able to penetrate
[1:15:39] us and we going to take a Rapture or and
[1:15:42] I say are you ready listen I I had
[1:15:45] things in there he says are you ready he
[1:15:48] says we would be physical Perth those
[1:15:51] that stays true to God
[1:15:54] we be phys are you ready for
[1:15:56] that I mean you know listen I'm going
[1:15:58] tell you something age ain't got nothing
[1:16:00] to do with the

[1:16:03] the
[1:16:04] Rapture sister
[1:16:06] Brandon you got a right to call for the
[1:16:08] healing your
[1:16:10] mama so but nature I mean just we going
[1:16:13] to got old I can't don't py all time
[1:16:15] about that I said age ain't got nothing
[1:16:17] to do with it it's what God
[1:16:21] says we need to quit play in church and
[1:16:24] come to church and become the Church of
[1:16:27] God that's what we need to do that's
[1:16:29] right and and we bet and we better do it
[1:16:32] we better do it well I guess I'll just
[1:16:35] close right now don't talk maybe too
[1:16:39] much but uh but I
[1:16:43] appreciate being able to to be back
[1:16:46] again and uh I don't I I don't
[1:16:49] understand listen I'm going to tell you
[1:16:50] something I don't understand and I've
[1:16:53] thought about it many times for 14 years
[1:16:56] that I didn't minister in this church
[1:16:57] and I knew I was supposed to be here
[1:16:59] brother D brother Dale told me one time
[1:17:02] and it was and it's he know he's bless
[1:17:05] him he said Brother D I believe you made
[1:17:07] a
[1:17:08] mistake but see I had made a pack if
[1:17:11] that that I don't know if that's a way
[1:17:13] to say it but I had asked God
[1:17:16] something and I had to stay with what I
[1:17:18] asked him and and and I if if if I had a
[1:17:24] I'm I'm I'm trying to leave that alone
[1:17:26] the best I
[1:17:28] could but I may I asked God to you let
[1:17:32] this happen Lord if you want me to
[1:17:34] minister in Lula Georgia again and I
[1:17:37] said for 14 almost 14 years right there
[1:17:40] I couldn't move I've had people try to
[1:17:43] get me to start churches how can you
[1:17:45] stay I said I hear the word it's a word
[1:17:48] it's a word I mean I mean I mean
[1:17:50] preachers preachers tell me that and and
[1:17:53] I could not God made sure that I didn't
[1:17:57] have nowhere else to go right and and
[1:18:02] and in God and at God's appointed time
[1:18:05] what I asked him 14 years ago I heard it
[1:18:09] now that's why I'm here right I'm back
[1:18:13] but I'm sorry for 14 years if if I had
[1:18:16] not have done that maybe I would have
[1:18:18] been back many years ago yeah cuz I mean
[1:18:21] I but when you tell God something you
[1:18:24] got I said listen when God tell if God
[1:18:26] tells me to stay I'll stay if he tell me
[1:18:29] I want you to preach no more you sit
[1:18:30] right there I said I'm going to do it me
[1:18:32] my wife will tell you I I said but
[1:18:34] whatever he says and when he says it I
[1:18:37] said he has always let me know what to
[1:18:39] do and when to do it always I said he
[1:18:42] won't fail me this time he
[1:18:44] didn't there's a lot of people left this
[1:18:47] church and I feel sorry for them that's
[1:18:49] right you walk off from the word that's
[1:18:52] right you made a bad mistake if you
[1:18:54] don't receive the word that's preached
[1:18:56] to you cuz that's God's way of doing it
[1:18:58] fath comes by hearing if you got any if
[1:19:01] you got any problems with anything that
[1:19:03] I've said forgive me and and ask me I I
[1:19:06] don't have no problem but at least give
