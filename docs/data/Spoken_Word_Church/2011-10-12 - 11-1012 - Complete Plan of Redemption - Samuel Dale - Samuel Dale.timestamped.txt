[17:49] that's right cu the prophet said he
[17:50] would right he'd become visible Among Us
[17:53] and raise the dead and we join the
[17:54] Rapture so I believe we can do that
[17:56] don't you good to see everybody in the
[17:58] house of the Lord if you'd like to turn
[18:00] in your scriptures turn to Job
[18:04] 38 Job

[19:48] exact dates but uh should be pretty
[19:50] close to the last anyway cuz it's always

[20:09] all
[20:10] things you said you give them to us

[20:30] and keep us and I pray that you'd just
[20:33] be with us tonight and open up our
[20:34] understanding that we may see you Lord

[20:42] faith lead us now to thine understanding
[20:45] as we read your word you come and speak
[20:47] to our hearts that we may walk in you

[21:06] Job
[21:09] 38 then the Lord answered job out of the
[21:12] Whirlwind and said who is this that
[21:14] darkeneth counsel by words without
[21:16] knowledge GT up now thy loins like a man
[21:20] behold I will demand of thee and answer
[21:25] thou me Forest thou when I love La the
[21:28] foundation of the earth declare if thou
[21:30] Hast understanding see the only thing
[21:33] that brother BR said that was wrong with
[21:35] job that he was a little
[21:38] exalted you know within his own self and
[21:40] a little bit to the point so that's what
[21:42] the Lord is doing he's just simply
[21:44] asking job said well just tell me now if
[21:47] you have all this understanding and
[21:49] things tell me where this is see then it
[21:52] it takes him down in a hurry don't it
[21:55] says where was thou when I laid the
[21:56] foundation of the Earth
[21:58] declare if thou Hast understanding who
[22:00] ha laid the measures thereof if thou
[22:04] knowest or who had stretcheth the line
[22:07] upon it whereupon are the foundations
[22:09] there aist and or who laid the
[22:12] Cornerstone thereof that's when the
[22:14] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[22:16] of God shouted for
[22:18] Joy oh who who shut up sea shut up the
[22:22] sea with doors when it Break Forth as if
[22:26] it were if it had issued out of the
[22:29] wound all right and he goes on he tells
[22:31] about making the clouds of thickness I
[22:33] left that off of it in the darkness but
[22:35] the main thing we want to look at is
[22:38] where were
[22:41] you cuz he gives the the key to it if
[22:44] you'll notice in verse six right all
[22:46] right you don't have to put it back up
[22:49] wherefore whereupon are the foundation
[22:51] there of fashion who or who laid the
[22:54] Cornerstone y so we'll get back to that
[22:57] in a minute you may be see SE the Lord
[22:58] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[23:00] word now we spoke on this back a while
[23:05] back when we were talking in our journey
[23:08] and our discussions and all in the
[23:10] message bringing it talking about the
[23:12] things taking place in heaven and I said
[23:15] I'd get down to it and we would come
[23:18] back to this uh again so I I want to try
[23:22] to take it up tonight in a way that
[23:24] maybe will give us a little
[23:26] understanding of something but I want to
[23:29] tie back to uh this past
[23:33] weekend cuz I want you to think about it
[23:36] because what was we talking
[23:39] about do we have a negative
[23:44] confession or do we have a spiritual
[23:47] Revelation right you remember what I was
[23:50] bringing now that
[23:53] anything
[23:55] whatsoever one step down downward
[23:58] whatever you would call it one word
[24:00] backward whatever whatever you would
[24:03] want to bring I was trying to get a
[24:04] point to you that anything out of a
[24:08] positive
[24:10] confession it would be re leaning into
[24:15] negativism all right right so I I hope
[24:18] you caught that point of what I was
[24:20] trying to bring because see I want it to
[24:22] be positive amen I don't want it to be
[24:25] to where we say well uh this is what I
[24:28] think you know what do you believe uh
[24:31] what is your input upon this I don't
[24:33] have no input we've either got thus
[24:36] sayith the Lord from the prophet of God
[24:38] are we in bad trouble you know but see
[24:42] that was what I was trying to get to
[24:43] point to you about is we don't need a
[24:46] negative confession right and anything
[24:48] out of saying it
[24:50] positive you're leaning to negativism
[24:54] and you say well no it was partial
[24:55] realization but now I hope you you don't
[24:58] get the wrong Point see partial
[25:00] realization is perfect realization right
[25:03] right right partial realization Martin
[25:05] Lu with the J shall live by faith that
[25:07] was the perfect complete y uh statement
[25:11] for the time amen right all right cuz
[25:15] that was perfect y all right you follow
[25:18] me see that would have been called
[25:19] partial realization compared to what we
[25:21] see
[25:22] now but remember anything imp partial
[25:25] realization is not talking about
[25:27] something
[25:29] negative am all right so don't get that
[25:31] thought into your mind see of what I was
[25:34] trying to bring it that we need a
[25:36] positive confession right and get away
[25:38] from our negativism amen you know all
[25:42] right now and see then we covered about
[25:44] the book of life and our names being
[25:48] written in the Book of Life and we
[25:51] talked about an open book
[25:54] amen now an open book
[25:58] because that's what our thought was you
[26:00] see the books it says in Daniel and it
[26:03] says in in Revelation that the books
[26:05] were
[26:06] open all right now we know that that
[26:09] goes to the white Throne yes and we will
[26:12] be sitting on the throne with him not
[26:15] standing before him at the white Throne
[26:17] all right but see then the books were
[26:21] opened now you remember what I was
[26:23] trying to bring out we'll get to it in
[26:24] just a
[26:26] minute and TI all together with the
[26:28] night's message the Lord willing
[26:31] that has the book become a brand new
[26:34] book to you like I told you I've heard
[26:36] people that have read three pages out of
[26:38] the seal book just is a point you know
[26:41] and they say the Bible's become a brand
[26:44] new book cuz they heard the prophet say
[26:47] that now the only way the Bible can
[26:49] become a brand new book to you and me or
[26:52] anyone right is for the seals to be
[26:56] broke right amen that's when the seals
[26:59] broke to the prophet he said it become a
[27:01] brand new book right not in the 50s Not
[27:05] in the 60 early what when the seals
[27:08] broke to the prophet right all right now
[27:10] when the seals break to you and
[27:13] I then the Bible becomes a brand new
[27:16] book right amen not just because you
[27:18] read the seal book and and can quote
[27:20] that
[27:21] quote see that's what people will say oh
[27:24] boy I come into the message and and and
[27:26] you talk to them about 2 minutes they
[27:27] don't even know what in the world world
[27:29] is sealed is about no that's right but
[27:31] yet it's Bible's become a brand new
[27:33] book well let's don't get caught into
[27:36] that business because if we do we we
[27:38] won't even be in partial realization
[27:41] that's right come on we'll be in sin
[27:44] right amen because we'll be in
[27:46] negativism right so you see the two
[27:48] messages I was trying to put it together
[27:51] to where we can see it and and really if
[27:53] you know the truth about it then God
[27:56] came here
[27:58] on the message on the open book and he
[28:00] opened it up to me here while I was
[28:03] preaching right as to how to bring it
[28:06] and and he did tonight just before the
[28:08] the service here that I had the notes
[28:10] and he said no this way so we go the way
[28:13] he told us to go that's right all right
[28:15] but now you follow what I was trying to
[28:19] bring we must have a positive confession
[28:22] about our faith amen amen MH the Bible
[28:26] says examine your faith you know examine
[28:28] you see whether you're in the faith or
[28:30] not right amen why are you worried about
[28:33] your
[28:34] Revelation right most preachers won't
[28:36] tell you what they
[28:37] believe you know they pedal are around
[28:40] it you know yep they won't come out and
[28:43] just tell you what they believe right
[28:45] because they don't want nobody to be
[28:46] able to you know they they don't want
[28:48] you to hammer it down say wait a minute
[28:49] that ain't right right n right so they
[28:53] want to put leave it to well that's what
[28:54] I was talking about I've seen people do
[28:57] that you know you you come up to them
[28:59] and say something and they oh yeah they
[29:01] go then you say something that was what
[29:02] I was talking about when you know that
[29:04] one what just talking about right all
[29:06] right but now see the open book then is
[29:10] only this
[29:11] Bible was open to the prophet when the
[29:14] seals broke right yes that's right you
[29:18] fall in my thought right that was what I
[29:20] trying to get across this is the
[29:23] book this is the Bible it had to be
[29:26] written
[29:28] yep before it could be opened right yep
[29:31] all right now so then we're in the
[29:34] book when it opens up it's going to
[29:37] reveal not only the day and time we live
[29:40] on the earth that's what most of you
[29:41] preachers preach about what's happening
[29:43] out here in the world yeah is our day no
[29:47] it's going to reveal our day in this
[29:48] message right what the revelation of
[29:53] redemption right
[29:55] right all right now that's what we want
[29:57] to get on to in a few minutes see the
[29:59] revelation of
[30:00] redemption but now get me then we can
[30:03] move on see anything outside of a
[30:07] positive confession is
[30:09] negativism right cuz you're not talking
[30:12] about partial
[30:13] realization cuz did you get what I said
[30:15] I'm saying it over again you say well
[30:18] Martin Luther didn't have it yes he had
[30:20] positive Revelation for his day right
[30:23] sure amen he had perfect Revelation for
[30:26] his day he had all that could be
[30:28] revealed for his day that's
[30:31] right but now comparing that to where we
[30:33] are yes partial realization but remember
[30:37] it was perfect to him that's right right
[30:40] Paul is not here but when he said you be
[30:44] Chang the moment twinkle eye to him that
[30:46] was perfect right I looking there today
[30:50] I believe was sometime when brother R
[30:52] said those prophets when they saw
[30:55] it he said it was was real to them right
[30:59] when non saw chariots Johson in the
[31:01] street that was real right right oh
[31:05] yeah he just as well as he'd been
[31:07] sitting right here watching them run
[31:08] into each other on the
[31:10] highway cuz it was perfect re Revelation
[31:14] all
[31:15] right but now remember what we're trying
[31:17] to
[31:18] do we spent about seven or eight
[31:22] messages dwelling about heaven and how
[31:25] real it is and whether God is real
[31:29] whether Heaven would be a real place or
[31:32] not and then we drop down the Earth and
[31:37] I we covered these things of like names
[31:39] written in the Book of Life we covered
[31:41] that while we were talking about it
[31:43] because that's what the Bible says
[31:45] happened there that's right so we
[31:47] covered then on this of the Morning Star
[31:50] saying together and the sons of God
[31:52] shouted for joy we we covered that and
[31:55] just you know hitting it going along
[31:57] and and to see then
[32:03] that the word has
[32:06] opened that we can see what's in heaven
[32:09] but we got to have the matching pieces
[32:11] here that's right all right you say but
[32:14] but brother
[32:16] Dale B guy was only in God's
[32:20] mind but if that does not come to a
[32:23] reality upon earth right that's it then
[32:26] what trouble is you've got that's right
[32:28] right amen you mean you got something
[32:30] that's in the Bible that would not take
[32:33] place upon
[32:34] Earth show it to me see you'd have a
[32:39] problem all right so then what we want
[32:41] to do is to see that what was in God's
[32:44] mind yes but if it don't happen here if
[32:48] Jesus Christ hadn't come here 2,000
[32:50] years ago and died upon the cross that
[32:53] would have made the the Revelation 3 138
[32:57] about the name written before the
[32:58] foundation that would have made that
[32:59] scripture anold right made it
[33:03] void that's right would have made it
[33:06] wrong all right so we're here in the end
[33:09] time right we are the ones now this
[33:12] could not be understood down Through the
[33:14] Ages like we're talking about it that's
[33:16] right amen come on they couldn't follow
[33:19] it cuz they didn't know it they couldn't
[33:22] couldn't bring it to the right
[33:24] place to they right songs there a new
[33:27] written down in glory in it's
[33:29] mind well everybody seen that say what's
[33:32] wonderful the Prophet come along and
[33:34] says good words ain't no re ain't no
[33:37] good Revelation to it he said because it
[33:39] all had to be written before the world
[33:42] right now so remember what we're doing
[33:45] now see we've left Heaven we've come to
[33:49] Earth and we're watching on Earth the
[33:53] things that we saw as we were talking
[33:56] while we were in the Heavenly reals
[33:59] right all right so now follow that
[34:02] thought and you you'll get the point now
[34:05] of what we're trying to
[34:06] bring all right when the more sons of
[34:10] God you know morning Stars sang together
[34:12] the sons of God shouted for Joy we've
[34:15] been through this we've read it let's
[34:17] read it
[34:18] again might change something in a minute
[34:21] when we get to the real thoughts so
[34:23] let's go ahead brothers and and just
[34:25] read a little bit
[34:29] number one on her notes this is taken
[34:33] from page one which would be paragraph
[34:36] one I guess too the serpent seed 58 928
[34:40] the
[34:42] evening and what what he's
[34:46] saying dear God the Great and Mighty God
[34:49] who formed All Things by the power of
[34:50] His Spirit as brought Jesus Christ his
[34:53] only begotten son who freely died for
[34:55] with Sinners the just for the the unjust
[34:57] to reconcile us back into His Marvelous
[34:59] Fellowship that we have again with
[35:02] God as we are caught in the Blessed word
[35:06] that we had fellowship with him before
[35:08] the foundation of the world you say
[35:10] where's that at that's in Ephesians 1
[35:13] that he chose us or Ephesians 13 that he
[35:17] chose us in him that's right before the
[35:19] foundation of the world that's right he
[35:22] told the disciples we'll get to it in a
[35:24] minute maybe this one here he told the
[35:26] disciples that he knew them and had
[35:28] fellowship with them before the
[35:30] foundation of the world right well now
[35:32] brother Dale do you believe that we
[35:34] would back there
[35:37] yeah but not like what people are
[35:39] talking about right right yep would back
[35:43] there as people
[35:45] no with little identities running
[35:48] around some kind of something we were
[35:50] only there in Jesus Christ that's right
[35:53] we've been through that and proved the
[35:54] point all right but listen as we are
[35:57] taught in the Blessed word that we had
[35:58] fellowship with him before the
[35:59] foundation of world when the morning
[36:01] star sang together and the sons of God
[36:02] shouted for Joy went back before the
[36:04] foundation of the world how do we know
[36:07] that that wasn't at the same time that
[36:09] the lamb was slain that when God in his
[36:13] great thinking seen us shouting and
[36:15] rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus
[36:19] and tonight we're only got it for tast
[36:21] of the great Glory Divine which shall be
[36:24] revealed at his coming it'll go on into
[36:26] that but think about
[36:30] it look at the next
[36:32] one and we read these
[36:34] before but a lot of people out there

[40:10] this is that you right you know I
[40:13] believe the prophet believed that going
[40:14] down let's read the next couple while we
[40:16] at it and then we'll get back and just
[40:17] preach a
[40:18] while Israel and the church part one or
[40:21] number one paragraph
[40:23] 59 look what he says with we had a
[40:26] little time to go to job 7:38 which is 3
[40:31] 7:37 which is 3 387 and see where he
[40:36] said where was you when I laid the
[40:37] foundation of
[40:39] world before I laid the foundation of
[40:41] world declare to me see where they're
[40:43] fing at or where was you when the
[40:45] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[40:47] of God shouted for
[40:48] Joy tell them to Jo buckle up yourself
[40:51] like a man I want to speak to you now
[40:54] Paul says he chose us in him
[40:59] amen the church before the foundation of
[41:03] the world
[41:04] yep all right so now brother R was
[41:07] putting where he chose us in him before
[41:10] the foundation of the world right in
[41:11] with the morning start saying together
[41:13] sons of God shouted for Joy let's go
[41:14] down and get the last one now which is
[41:17] spiritual Amnesia paragraph
[41:19] 88644
[41:22] 11 now to be a true
[41:24] Christian you have to be the son
[41:27] we don't want to forget that all that he
[41:30] was I'm identified with him right I'm
[41:33] identified with him notice and he is in
[41:36] me and I in him notice then every
[41:39] Christian that's a real genuine
[41:41] Christian Christian was with him when
[41:44] the morning Stars sang together and the
[41:46] sons of God shouted for Joy before there
[41:48] was a foundation of the world we were
[41:50] identified in the immortal Realms with
[41:53] God 10 million years before the world
[41:56] world was ever formed I was back there
[41:58] with him if I got eternal life I was
[42:02] there with him I was identified with him
[42:05] when the morning stars came together the
[42:07] sons of God shouted for Joy now he just
[42:09] answered it right if you have eternal
[42:11] life right what was back there right so
[42:14] we get to reading out of the
[42:16] way what was back there what happened
[42:19] back
[42:22] there you see we spend all of our
[42:25] time and I do too but I like to think
[42:27] about
[42:28] it I like to think about what that was
[42:31] and we spent a lot of time preaching
[42:32] about in heaven and seeing the things
[42:35] and in the eternities and coming down
[42:38] and how that's eternal life is the only
[42:40] thing you're dealing with you remember
[42:42] that it's not a people or little
[42:44] identities running around up in heaven
[42:46] some kind of form we were chosen in
[42:47] Jesus Christ according to the scriptures
[42:49] and according to the prophet amen and he
[42:51] had fellowship with us before the
[42:53] foundation of the world according to the
[42:55] scriptures right but what kind of a
[42:57] fellowship was that and what was taking
[43:00] place we wasn't back there as
[43:04] people we've been through
[43:06] that sure you can say this is in God's
[43:11] mind that he saw it but now we went
[43:14] through that too in a message or two
[43:16] that God's mind is a way under greater
[43:19] than anything we could think of even as
[43:21] natural that's right right amen he said
[43:24] my thoughts are not your thoughts my
[43:25] ways are not your ways all right well we
[43:29] found out that we wasn't people before
[43:31] the world they that's the prophet where
[43:33] were Spirits back then he said no we
[43:35] wasn't nothing we was only in God's
[43:40] mind but just remember now how we
[43:42] brought down
[43:47] predestination that predestination looks
[43:50] back to for knowledge right
[43:55] amen
[43:59] then what is it tall talking
[44:03] about and this is what struck me tonight
[44:06] so I'm going to try to bring it down in
[44:07] just in plain
[44:10] language we spend a lot of time trying
[44:12] to figure out what was before the
[44:17] world we spent a lot of time in
[44:19] predestination trying to
[44:21] comprehend what we
[44:24] were that's what good I have too all
[44:28] have I said
[44:31] we but you
[44:33] know as I said there a moment
[44:38] ago the Bible says that Jesus Christ
[44:41] stood as a lamb's L yeah but you know if
[44:45] that had never happened upon the
[44:49] Earth that would have made the scripture
[44:51] void
[44:53] with but you know one day on this Earth
[44:57] to exactly match what that
[45:00] was Jesus Christ died on the cross
[45:06] right see in the reality is
[45:11] here no amen the reality is here upon
[45:17] Earth if we can just see it then we'll
[45:20] see why that one
[45:23] day heaven will even come to Earth
[45:29] right right the future home's coming
[45:32] down right right it's not going to do
[45:34] away with heaven right you remember the
[45:36] story remember the message not going to
[45:38] do away with Heaven Heaven's going to
[45:40] come to earth right amen it's going to
[45:44] be engulfed by
[45:47] eternity we see we do we spend a lot of
[45:49] time trying to figure out what we were
[45:54] yeah that's
[45:58] right when
[46:03] really if the morning Stars sang
[46:06] together and the sons of God shouted for
[46:07] Jordan we know the Bible says it did and
[46:10] we know that that was us and we read
[46:11] where the Prophet said that that was
[46:14] when we saw the Plan of
[46:18] Redemption well you know the Plan of
[46:20] Redemption would be on
[46:24] earth right
[46:28] are you listening That's
[46:31] right The Plan of Redemption wasn't in
[46:34] heaven Jesus Christ never physically
[46:36] died in heaven that's
[46:39] right he had to come to earth
[46:42] right to die
[46:45] amen
[46:47] salvation wasn't needed in heaven that's
[46:53] right oh yeah the angels that fa yeah
[46:55] yeah that's true that
[46:58] but don't work for them does it but it's
[47:01] not talking about
[47:04] them see we're going to find out one of
[47:06] these days that we
[47:08] are as this world the center of the
[47:12] whole
[47:14] universe not because we're the center of
[47:17] it because of geographical locations
[47:20] right but we're the center of the Earth
[47:22] because this is where God wants to dwell
[47:24] with his people amen right that's right
[47:26] that's what he designed this far that's
[47:29] right
[47:32] amen I think it's about time for us to
[47:34] start talking about what is happening on
[47:37] earth
[47:41] now and in doing that I only wrote one
[47:44] little thing across my
[47:46] page that changed the whole message that
[47:49] I was going to preach maybe someday I'll
[47:50] get back preach something
[47:54] but
[47:59] we
[48:04] established that somebody that's going
[48:07] to be redeemed upon
[48:09] Earth saw that Plan of
[48:12] Redemption before the
[48:16] world while in eternal life
[48:21] right
[48:23] okay and we didn't get to come to Earth
[48:26] as Eternal
[48:28] people because if it did there would be
[48:30] no need of a Plan of Redemption that's
[48:32] right are you listening that's right why
[48:35] would you need a Plan of Redemption if
[48:36] everybody's Eternal that's right so it's
[48:38] not that way for God you he was going to
[48:42] bring us to
[48:46] Earth while we were in Jesus Christ is
[48:49] the only place you can put us because
[48:50] that's the
[48:52] Bible see then in Jesus Christ was the
[48:55] full Plan of
[48:57] Redemption and
[49:00] thereby we could see
[49:02] it not as our eyes
[49:08] see but we would know that we could not
[49:10] be
[49:14] lost now think with
[49:19] me the reason we were shouting is
[49:21] because we knew we couldn't be lost
[49:24] right
[49:27] there's no way to lose eternal life you
[49:29] remember we went through a message on
[49:32] that Adam never fell from eternal life
[49:35] in his
[49:37] soul God's not an ending Giver the
[49:39] prophet
[49:40] said he fell from the position to where
[49:43] he would have become Eternal in body and
[49:47] the world would have been become Eternal
[49:51] right he fell from that position to
[49:54] death
[50:00] all
[50:01] right so
[50:09] then the only ones that would know about
[50:11] the Plan of
[50:13] Redemption would be those that were a
[50:16] part of God right before the world ever
[50:21] begun but for us to have stayed up in
[50:24] heaven would have never brought for
[50:30] Redemption and we wouldn't have never
[50:32] come forth because we'd have been in
[50:33] Jesus
[50:36] Christ right we wasn't little identities
[50:39] running around I went through that over
[50:41] and over with you that's right right
[50:44] don't never think about that we were
[50:45] little Mormon doctrine of souls up there
[50:48] in heaven you know running around little
[50:51] peoples running out with you
[50:54] no we was in Jesus Christ
[50:59] right cuz that's when he came to Earth
[51:01] he came to Earth with us in
[51:06] him Eve was in Adam Adam was in Eve
[51:11] remember all
[51:14] right so then really what was happening
[51:17] back
[51:19] there was us looking at what's happening
[51:24] now simple little
[51:29] Point what did they see where were you
[51:32] job when the morning star sang together
[51:35] and the sons of God shouted for
[51:38] Joy was he asking him how far back he
[51:43] was how far could his thinking go back
[51:46] into
[51:51] eternity or was he asking
[51:54] him
[51:57] where he is
[52:03] now CU remember one of the quotes we
[52:07] read we read one we read two quotes in
[52:10] the
[52:11] beginning we're talking about could that
[52:14] have been when the their names were
[52:15] written on the
[52:18] book the third
[52:21] one
[52:23] was when we come to Earth
[52:27] you remember that go back to number
[52:29] three brother
[52:38] Joe okay can you flick it back up
[52:42] brother number four excuse me no number
[52:46] three number three you got it you got
[52:51] it when they
[52:53] seen the coming of the Savior to redeem
[53:01] mankind when they seen the coming of a
[53:05] savior 2,000 years
[53:08] ago like I said we spend our time A lot
[53:11] of times trying to figure out through
[53:13] predestination and for knowledges and
[53:15] what were we and
[53:17] what and we've left
[53:20] off what we really are
[53:24] now
[53:26] you know that we're living our
[53:27] predestination
[53:29] right you know that we're proving
[53:31] whether or not we did have any part to
[53:33] do with this
[53:35] situation by what we
[53:43] do you realize that if there was
[53:46] anything about us whatsoever it would
[53:48] only be the eternal
[53:53] life that eternal life would have
[53:56] to not come here
[53:59] Eternal
[54:01] right or there wouldn't be no Plan of
[54:05] Redemption writing our names in the
[54:09] book when does he write our names in the
[54:14] book according to the Bible it was
[54:17] before the foundation of the
[54:21] world but when did he write it in this
[54:23] book that's right
[54:29] remember this is the book in the hand of
[54:31] the one sitting on the throne that's
[54:34] right this is the book that's in
[54:38] heaven right and you know
[54:43] that there was no way to reveal
[54:46] it until the book was completed right
[54:49] right that's right CS didn't come off
[54:51] the book and the prophet in the 50s he
[54:53] tried to preach it yes but he preached
[54:55] the white hor RIT or was the Holy Ghost
[55:01] right so what truth he brought was truth
[55:07] yes but it was not perfect
[55:14] realization are you
[55:18] listening when the book is completed the
[55:21] prophet said then the lamb takes the
[55:24] book
[55:26] all
[55:27] right now the book was
[55:31] completed when John wrote the life's
[55:39] part come on the book was completed
[55:43] right when John wrote Because he wrote
[55:45] of the church ages he wrote of the
[55:46] tribulation he wrote of all he wrote
[55:48] everything down right 95 996 somewhere
[55:51] in there
[55:53] right but it was wasn't opened right
[55:56] that's right it was a closed book
[56:01] amen sure we saw certain things yes and
[56:04] things were preached because that was
[56:06] the faith of the
[56:09] fathers they had those things and
[56:11] brought us those things it was written
[56:13] down and we could follow it to a degree
[56:16] but we couldn't get into the Book of
[56:18] Revelation
[56:21] right because the Book of Revelation had
[56:24] the Bible sealed
[56:27] up some things we could read and see and
[56:29] believe we could believe in Jesus we we
[56:31] could believe in the New Birth we should
[56:33] have been able to believe in one God
[56:35] right yeah cuz the disciples preached it
[56:41] y but you see the book had to be
[56:43] completed when it once it was
[56:45] completed it had to wait almost 2,000
[56:48] years before the lamb could take the
[56:53] book and break the seal y right then it
[56:57] would become an open book or in other
[56:59] words an Open Bible M this Bible's open
[57:03] now you want to know what it says read
[57:06] it right you want to know what it means
[57:09] get the prophet
[57:10] right right ask the prophet what does
[57:14] that scripture
[57:18] mean why because it's an open book
[57:23] right you see it wasn't open until the
[57:27] seals broke right and it's not open to
[57:30] you and I until the seals break to us
[57:32] that's right you see when I tried my
[57:34] best to get you to to listen and and
[57:37] follow after those things of the opening
[57:39] of the seals
[57:41] right and yet people are say we sure we
[57:44] understand the SE my horse rider
[57:49] Antichrist how do you know it's an
[57:51] antichrist Prophet said it yeah oh y
[57:55] ouch
[57:57] try thank God
[58:00] Amen but what's your Revelation that's
[58:03] it well I don't have one I told you
[58:05] about years ago a man I preached I had a
[58:08] revelation of something and a man that
[58:11] used to be my best friend that sit in my
[58:12] home and eat and we Fellowship weekly
[58:15] and preach for him all the time he
[58:16] preached here and he sent me word he
[58:19] didn't want I done do me no more cuz I
[58:21] got off the
[58:23] message cuz I said I had a revelation he
[58:26] said brother bram's the only one who got
[58:28] the Revelation he said that's my
[58:30] Revelation that brother Bram had the
[58:33] Revelation I said well you know it's
[58:34] kind of hard and he said the same thing
[58:36] I did he said he had a revelation I said
[58:38] I had
[58:39] one right come
[58:42] on he even think about what he said he
[58:44] said he had a revelation that brother
[58:46] Ram had the Revelation well that was a
[58:48] revelation to him all I said was and I
[58:50] had a revelation of the same thing
[58:52] brother randam said
[58:56] and belied it right you see what we can
[58:59] do we can get tied up in our own little
[59:05] things but get back to what I'm talking
[59:11] about if if it doesn't happen
[59:16] here what was seen back there that would
[59:19] make that false prophecy right
[59:21] right you understand that point
[59:23] Everybody follow me right if it don't
[59:26] happen on earth right then what was
[59:28] written in heaven would be false that
[59:29] would be some man's idea opinion wrote
[59:32] down but when it happens on Earth
[59:34] exactly like that
[59:38] happened
[59:41] right now down through
[59:45] time they dealt with a
[59:49] partiality right right the book was open
[59:53] to the degree of what the discip IPL had
[59:55] preached right that's what I try to get
[59:58] the point in there the Bible opened to
[1:00:01] the point of what the faith of the
[1:00:03] fathers had talked
[1:00:06] about and you could preach one God
[1:00:09] brother around did before the seals
[1:00:11] broke Paul did Peter did John all them
[1:00:15] preached one God water baptism no
[1:00:17] eternal hell and all that they all
[1:00:19] preached
[1:00:23] it that was before the opening of the
[1:00:25] seals
[1:00:29] right but you see the book was still
[1:00:33] just partially open that's
[1:00:36] right brother R said we could what do he
[1:00:39] call it
[1:00:41] uh guess at it or
[1:00:45] Ponder probe probe thank you he said we
[1:00:48] could prob at
[1:00:50] it but said we couldn't see it that's
[1:00:53] right why because the seals did not come
[1:00:56] off the book all right 1963 the seals
[1:01:00] broke to the prophet he came off the
[1:01:02] book right
[1:01:07] amen then he could see the book right he
[1:01:11] could see what happened in heaven you
[1:01:13] know why because he knew what was
[1:01:16] happening in heaven was right then
[1:01:17] happening on Earth that's
[1:01:21] right come on is it in the Bible that
[1:01:23] the lamb T the
[1:01:25] book
[1:01:27] right what is that about five Revelation
[1:01:31] five Y where the lamb took the book
[1:01:35] amen see when the lamb took the book
[1:01:38] that Prophet went right there and
[1:01:39] started from right there he started in
[1:01:41] chapter 4 but he went into chapter 5
[1:01:44] right and he started talking about the
[1:01:47] lamb that had took the book
[1:01:49] man and that's what he said here stands
[1:01:52] a lamb with a book in his hand and and
[1:01:54] there goes a white horse rider he said
[1:01:56] thereby that's got to be the Antichrist
[1:01:59] right cuz he seen that fell that guy
[1:02:02] read your first
[1:02:04] seal he seen him riding off right the
[1:02:08] seal was broke to the
[1:02:10] prophet but have they been broke to you
[1:02:12] and I that's
[1:02:14] right when they're broke to you and I
[1:02:17] we'll quit trying to figure out what
[1:02:18] went on in heaven we start trying to
[1:02:20] realize to what I what is happening on
[1:02:23] Earth does it match heaven
[1:02:25] right right amen right I preached that
[1:02:28] five or six years ago matching
[1:02:32] pieces When In Heaven There Was An Angel
[1:02:35] flew
[1:02:38] across when that angel flew across there
[1:02:40] was a man on
[1:02:43] Earth named Martin
[1:02:46] Luther that called the revelation of the
[1:02:49] just shall live by
[1:02:52] faith that's exactly the angel in heaven
[1:02:56] it turned the world upside down like I
[1:02:58] told you many people tried to protest
[1:03:00] the Catholic church but it didn't
[1:03:02] work the moravians how you pronounce it
[1:03:06] right you doing good was the ones that
[1:03:07] Tau taught John Wesley the truth of
[1:03:11] sanctification but that was not that
[1:03:13] angel in heaven
[1:03:16] right but when Mark when John Wesley
[1:03:19] preached sanctification and got it in
[1:03:22] the way he's supposed to be bringing it
[1:03:25] and match that angel in
[1:03:28] heaven now
[1:03:31] listen when this end time Prophet came
[1:03:34] on
[1:03:36] Earth there was a seventh angel right
[1:03:39] amen right right spoke of in the
[1:03:43] Bible he had a lot to do with
[1:03:47] it and he brought the message right then
[1:03:51] you can see that seven Angel where was
[1:03:53] he at
[1:03:54] he would have to be a
[1:03:57] prophet to match what was in heaven
[1:04:00] right because in heaven it already been
[1:04:02] written some
[1:04:07] scriptures Malachi
[1:04:10] 4 Luke
[1:04:14] 17:30 Revelation
[1:04:17] 10:7
[1:04:19] right somebody had to mat at down here
[1:04:23] right right
[1:04:25] when it was matched down
[1:04:28] here it was because it was already there
[1:04:31] that's right
[1:04:33] right we read there where the Prophet
[1:04:35] said we dealt in the reals of the
[1:04:38] immortal by having eternal
[1:04:42] life you realize what I'm
[1:04:46] saying the prophet said when the bride
[1:04:49] realizes who she is that's right
[1:04:52] y yep and what she's doing
[1:04:57] here he said Satan will be
[1:05:01] powerless right what he
[1:05:04] said amen well I tell you what brother I
[1:05:06] just can't see poweress what are you
[1:05:08] looking for him to
[1:05:10] be that's
[1:05:13] right see there's are negative
[1:05:16] confessions when are we going to start
[1:05:18] confessing it I mean we're going to
[1:05:20] confess that God sent a prophet let's
[1:05:23] confess it in rap
[1:05:24] way let's confess that God sent a
[1:05:27] prophet to fulfill all these scriptures
[1:05:29] to speak of a bride come on right that's
[1:05:32] right but you don't hear that it's only
[1:05:34] speaking of him is what people preach
[1:05:39] yeah spoken words Original Seed he said
[1:05:41] this Prophet would be pointing to the
[1:05:45] skies at a word MN
[1:05:50] bride that's
[1:05:53] right
[1:05:55] when we match that they would seen there
[1:05:58] that's
[1:06:01] right you say well where do we
[1:06:06] match I mean you say actually what part
[1:06:08] of that word do we
[1:06:15] match the Plan of Redemption has been
[1:06:17] understood since
[1:06:20] Calvary
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:24] but that was where he laid the
[1:06:26] Cornerstone y you remember we read
[1:06:29] that's right who laid the Cornerstone
[1:06:31] the Cornerstone was laid on the day of
[1:06:33] Pentecost right Calvary in the day of
[1:06:35] Pentecost Jesus
[1:06:38] Christ but the headstones coming the end
[1:06:40] time
[1:06:44] amen see
[1:06:47] Church those people down through time
[1:06:49] could shout about their religion they
[1:06:51] had we were talking the other day in my
[1:06:54] wife was you know the people will say it
[1:06:56] you know we come to America for for
[1:06:59] freedom of religion that's not why we
[1:07:03] came
[1:07:04] here we came here for freedom from
[1:07:08] religion we didn't come here freedom of
[1:07:10] religion and we brought the same junk
[1:07:13] over here with
[1:07:14] us we come here as freedom from religion
[1:07:17] to get away from the Catholic church and
[1:07:18] all those things this nation was not
[1:07:21] established on the freedom of religion
[1:07:23] it established on the freedom from
[1:07:27] religion see that's what they're doing
[1:07:29] now is they're forcing all religions
[1:07:31] together
[1:07:34] right under a One World Government
[1:07:38] y to bring it right back to where we
[1:07:40] tried to get away from all that
[1:07:42] stuff but you see
[1:07:46] Church it wasn't time down to there to
[1:07:50] see it like we're supposed to see
[1:07:52] it you followed
[1:07:55] me the prophet read and
[1:07:59] preached as a matter of fact I think all
[1:08:02] of these quotes but
[1:08:03] one that I gave
[1:08:07] you one of them I
[1:08:10] think is
[1:08:12] 64 matter of fact I think all of them
[1:08:14] are
[1:08:15] below all the six I gave you are below
[1:08:19] 60 below the 63 of the opening of the
[1:08:22] seals
[1:08:26] come
[1:08:29] on on the day of Pentecost they saw the
[1:08:32] Plan of Redemption those people were
[1:08:34] rejoicing because they got the baptism
[1:08:37] of the Holy Ghost that's right yep amen
[1:08:40] that matched in
[1:08:44] heaven as each Church age came forth and
[1:08:47] a bride of that age was sealed in by the
[1:08:49] Holy Spirit they were rejoicing right
[1:08:52] because they match what that was
[1:08:58] Amen brother R said when the seals broke
[1:09:01] to John said he saw his name you didn't
[1:09:04] see John wrote
[1:09:06] down CU under the that the prophet said
[1:09:09] it's not Samuel Dale is not there he
[1:09:13] said it be that name it was before the
[1:09:16] foundation of the
[1:09:17] world John saw his name before the
[1:09:20] foundation of the world why because he
[1:09:22] saw what was taking place
[1:09:24] on earth
[1:09:26] right John is taking up to see what's
[1:09:29] going on in
[1:09:32] heaven right right John takeen to heaven
[1:09:36] to see what's going on but he's
[1:09:39] rejoicing was because he saw his
[1:09:42] name and he was down here on
[1:09:45] Earth go he s over there of P right
[1:09:52] right and he
[1:09:55] wrote no wonder the prophet would say
[1:09:57] John heard the Thunders sure that's just
[1:10:02] opening to
[1:10:03] me he said John heard the
[1:10:07] Thunders well because he heard the
[1:10:09] complete Plan of Redemption right cuz
[1:10:12] listen church that's what I'm trying to
[1:10:14] get you to see what I want you to see is
[1:10:16] this
[1:10:18] part if a bride of Jesus Christ don't
[1:10:21] become the word to raise the rest from
[1:10:24] the dead then all that's behind us is
[1:10:27] false prophecy amen that's right amen
[1:10:31] come I don't mind stating it that way
[1:10:33] you say you get in trouble with God no I
[1:10:35] believe that's what he's wanting me to
[1:10:38] say it's all depended upon this end time
[1:10:41] bride to see the complete Plan of
[1:10:43] Redemption not a partial realization
[1:10:46] that's right amen right but to see the
[1:10:48] complete Plan of Redemption
[1:10:52] yep that's right and Shout about
[1:10:56] it Rejoice about it that's
[1:11:01] right come on because if you was up
[1:11:04] there in eternal life y then you're
[1:11:08] looking down here where you got it
[1:11:10] at CU you didn't come here with eternal
[1:11:13] life cuz if you did you didn't need no
[1:11:15] Plan of Redemption right that's right
[1:11:16] amen that's right you don't need to be
[1:11:18] redeemed if you have eternal
[1:11:22] life right
[1:11:24] oh we just need a new body you know
[1:11:26] that's what everybody preaches y That's
[1:11:31] Right would you see
[1:11:35] church we are the people that's got to
[1:11:37] see ourselves
[1:11:40] amen but the only way you can know
[1:11:42] you're there is to have eternal life
[1:11:44] here right amen that's right if you
[1:11:47] don't have eternal life here and don't
[1:11:49] know who you are then there's no way to
[1:11:51] know you back there right right what I
[1:11:53] say it we spend our time trying to
[1:11:55] figure out what we was back there
[1:11:57] instead of spending our time in in our
[1:12:00] own Holy Ghost understanding to see that
[1:12:03] Christ lives in you and I now amen
[1:12:06] that's
[1:12:07] right the Plan of Redemption is what
[1:12:10] they saw they saw the coming of this
[1:12:13] Redeemer a savior amen they saw Jesus
[1:12:16] Christ 2,000 years ago right
[1:12:20] right come on you'd have to agree with
[1:12:22] that
[1:12:24] but they saw all the way down through
[1:12:26] time of each age and the Bride of that
[1:12:28] age and she would realize who she
[1:12:32] is and come forth as a part of the word
[1:12:36] for that age but there's a word for this
[1:12:39] age amen because they didn't see a
[1:12:43] partial realization that's
[1:12:49] right and if you was back there if that
[1:12:52] eternal life you have toight not wasn't
[1:12:54] back there it never will be there cuz
[1:12:56] you don't have eternal life right that's
[1:12:58] right that
[1:13:01] simple brother de don't know whether I
[1:13:03] have eternal life or not well then start
[1:13:05] seeking God for that's right
[1:13:08] amen that's right it's like I told
[1:13:11] somebody the other day that they told me
[1:13:12] that they had the new birth they had
[1:13:14] eternal life I said yep in the day I got
[1:13:17] eternal life from that day till now I
[1:13:19] said I've never stopped seeking for
[1:13:20] eternal life right right that's right
[1:13:23] what do you mean you got
[1:13:25] it you don't have it if that's what you
[1:13:28] think that's right so that's what you
[1:13:30] think that you got eternal life but that
[1:13:32] don't make you more desirous right amen
[1:13:35] of eternal life that's right and you
[1:13:37] don't have eternal life that's right
[1:13:39] right right and then it's the only thing
[1:13:41] like I said it's the only thing that
[1:13:42] I've always wanted to give
[1:13:44] away cuz I know I
[1:13:50] can't I can't give it away that's right
[1:13:54] like I told my wife we were talking
[1:13:56] today and she made a good statement
[1:13:58] about it I won't go through what we were
[1:14:00] talking about I'll just make the
[1:14:02] statement of what we concluded finishing
[1:14:09] up she said honey you got to realize one
[1:14:11] of these days everybody don't want to
[1:14:12] hear
[1:14:14] you I said I've realized that a long
[1:14:16] time ago
[1:14:18] right but I said if the day ever comes
[1:14:21] I'm paraphrasing it where it won't get
[1:14:22] around in wrong thing yeah I said but if
[1:14:26] the day ever
[1:14:27] comes that I don't have a burden in my
[1:14:30] heart that's for people that's
[1:14:33] right that's and want people to see this
[1:14:37] message irregardless of whether they
[1:14:39] want to hear me or not y if the day ever
[1:14:42] comes that I don't want people to hear
[1:14:45] the word I'm lost y that's right I know
[1:14:49] I was
[1:14:51] lost but it doesn't matter if people
[1:14:53] turn me down if they don't want to hear
[1:14:58] me I still want you to hear about Jesus
[1:15:01] Christ right that's right I still want
[1:15:03] you to hear about eternal life amen I
[1:15:06] still want you to know the truth amen
[1:15:09] I've always said God one thing let me
[1:15:12] preach eternal life to my
[1:15:15] kids
[1:15:16] y because I want them to have eternal
[1:15:19] life don't you amen that's right then
[1:15:23] let's preach eternal life let's live
[1:15:25] eternal
[1:15:26] life the Bible says you're written
[1:15:29] Epistles right right known and read of
[1:15:31] all man right if nothing else we got one
[1:15:34] thing that that people have all in
[1:15:36] common about well you ain't nothing but
[1:15:38] word word word L that's what everybody
[1:15:41] says about it right you ain't nothing
[1:15:43] but word word word I just don't know
[1:15:46] nothing else to be I'm sorry I love
[1:15:50] everybody and I like I said I'd love to
[1:15:51] have everybody
[1:15:55] and I'll do the best I can I'll keep
[1:15:57] preaching as long as I can right to try
[1:15:59] to get people to see eternal life
[1:16:02] amen but listen folks let's quit trying
[1:16:04] to figure out if we up our dancing
[1:16:06] around let's start dancing down here you
[1:16:08] know what then you'll find out for
[1:16:10] certain you was up
[1:16:12] there because we'll match exactly what
[1:16:15] was there when we match what's there
[1:16:18] it'll all be over with as I said Martin
[1:16:20] Luther when he matched what was in
[1:16:22] heaven the just shall live by faith had
[1:16:24] to strike the Earth that's right and a
[1:16:26] man had to carry the
[1:16:27] message when Malachi 4 and Luke 17
[1:16:30] Revelation 10:7 and all that when it
[1:16:32] come time that it was to be made known
[1:16:34] on Earth in the days of the son of man
[1:16:38] that Luke
[1:16:40] 1730 there had to be a man on Earth Amen
[1:16:44] to cure that message that's right he
[1:16:47] said I wonder if them other Messengers
[1:16:49] seen
[1:16:50] that you remember
[1:16:54] He said Each messenger would get maybe
[1:16:55] another name change he said I wonder if
[1:16:59] they saw
[1:17:03] that you see he didn't see it until the
[1:17:05] seals broke right right that's it the
[1:17:08] seals broke to him then he could Rejoice
[1:17:10] about eternal
[1:17:12] life you say yeah but the most horrible
