part so don't run downstairs and wonder where the food's at if you do you can run on over to the store and take care of that until we get through but just remember that part okay if you'd like tur in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Hebrews 11 and then we will go to Matthew 16 Hebrews 11 Matthew 16 Heavenly Father we thank you we love you and we Praise Your Great Name and we just ask you to help us and guide us forgive our sins cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness help our thoughts and our minds to be Set On You Lord and not on the things of the world and life but to be what you want us to be we love you and we thank you and we ask you now to just have your way with us as we speak about you you come on the scene in each one of our hearts and lives guide each and every one of us remember the sick remember Gabby our Lord the baby coming forth we pray that everything will be all right and all will be well we committed all to you now remember all of the prayer requests remember the fer family there in the loss of the loved one and just be with each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Hebrews 11 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear all right let's go over to Matthew 16 and we'll begin reading in verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am they said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias and others jeremias are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee now what that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it meaning it'll be against it but not be able to Prevail and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now okay all righty some will be faned and some will be tickled to death Joyce is green in she said hey it's nice warm don't tell nobody that it's warm in here nobody will never know it all right but now we've been talking for quite a while about faith and knowing that faith is the substance of things hope for in whatever you desire if you really have faith you have the substance of what that is that you're asking about but yet you can't see it you can't show it to anybody else why because it's something that you have and you have it alone and it goes back to that word of faith all right Faith Revelation now remember what we were talking about Sunday that you know Faith being a revelation all right now then whatever anything consist of it had to First have a beginning because it was a time that it had no beginning and it was of no uh what we call Earthly substance but God had in his mind all right and in his mind see as far as he was concerned it was already in existence right right amen now but yet there was no physical uh thing that would be uh said about it or talked about it as something that was back there because it was only in God's mind but yet in God's mind that was the actual whatever it would come from CU that's what the scripture says you know that that things that they do not appear in other words it wouldn't there but it it was brought from somewhere to there but not as we talked about Sunday afternoon you know where brother Brown said that the seed was laying there from another civilization well you know people want to know how many worlds was before this and what this was and what that was well I I don't look at that like that I look at it as being that the seed the life the world and the things came from God's mind right y all right and that would be another civilization right see we look at civilization as um houses cars trains uh planes Etc life but you know no matter what you would say there was a time that nothing didn't exist right all right but God alone okay all right then he began to bring into being and remember how we were trying to bring that out that he by faith he by Revelation how many times have you ever heard we were listening to tape the other night and brother R said said see there said God believed his own word you know I mean he believes his own word he said it but he believes his own word all right see because it all come from one substance we know that the Bible says that all things were created by the word all right see then whatever it is the word would be more sure than any tangible points or substance that we would talk about am so then that's why it goes back and the prophet would bring it to Faith being a revelation and have you ever had a revelation of something that you could not explain it to no one else but yet to you it was real but yet you try and other people just look at you you know even though maybe they had a revelation of one God but yet when you start talking about it it's still terminologies or words hides things from Mankind in the basis of trying to explain it and it really covers it up and puts it to where that you can't right you know the best thing to do is just say it and just go on cuz if you try to explain it you're going to get in trouble anyway cuz you're not going to have any words to explain it to them because until God speaks to them they don't know what you're talking about yet they've had many Revelations maybe right but they don't know what you're talking about all right see then that's to me is the most that's is the most simple thing that you could ever think of then as to be able to read Hebrews 11 and say faith is the substance of things hop for the evidence of Things Not Seen All right but then it goes on to say through faith understanding and it being made known to us we understand the worlds were framed amen by the word of God amen amen all right how do we understand that there was a time that we wondered how it got here right did this bang go off and this thing happened and what happened you know and and we wound up in the world and and all of that and I get to thinking about that sometimes and I really I get to laughing at at our own stupidity to think that we laid so you know the pows a different you laid so long over here and then you turned over here and you grow another arm and then you growed another arm and took all these years to keep growing Parts well then we've been around here now for about 6,000 years and hadn't growed any more parts I mean look like in that amount of time we'd growed something you know that's just the way I think about it but sorry just being that carnal all right but remember now a revelation has God ever revealed to you that he's real I mean are is or is it just based upon brother brandham said it Paul said it uh so and so said it mama said it grandma said it or is it something real to you now remember that no man can call the Jesus the Christ except what it be by the new birth right see something personal to you outside of that it's words right it's words it's thoughts it's things all right and see then it becomes down to the hour that we're living and and watch it in a minute when we get to that point that you know that God is not through creating right he's still creating his body right unless the LI one has come in and if it does there's still a lot of growth development that goes with all of that and things but you know if he's still creating then his creation is not finished right right watch it in a minute now we'll get back to that to where that the whole church is built upon Revelation see he that cometh to God the Bible says must believe that he is amen not he was or about him or heard about him or talked to somebody about him and you know no matter who it was that done to talking it's still not real until it comes something to you see then then I tell you that we have one true and living God right right but brother klees God is brother klees God that's how personal God is to each and every one of us all right so then I don't say I serve the god of William brandham see I don't say that I serve the god of the Apostle Paul no he's something personal to you and I all right then that brings it to where that we bring out you know that he that cometh to God must believe that he is present tense amen Faith then is present tense see bringing it down to where we're living and what has been the whole of thought the process that I've been trying to bring throughout these uh 10 Services now about a positive attitude about seeing God for yourself that's right to not just be dependent upon what somebody else said even though that's wonderful right because Faith cometh by hearing right and hearing by the word all right but something to where that it can be real to you and me amen see then that way then you don't have any fear and see we went through now just going to I I cut out a lot of this and and I didn't give them the quotes now so in a minute we'll pick back up but you know a couple of messages now we've been kind of in into uh two different or two or three messages I had written down but remember now you cannot have a revelation the prophet said on the message of rapture without it being faith he said faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you right it's a revelation you can't be saved without a revelation that's right you remember went through that uh Patman Vision he can only be known there's another paragraph about two over from where we were 69 of pma's vision that you can only be saved by Revelation he said he can only be known by Revelation and you can only be saved by Revelation he said you have a knowledge an intellectual part but if that's not revealed then you're not saved because you can't see no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost something person in you not because the Bible says it right now listen not because the prophet said it not because Paul said it or grandmother said it or whatever it's when something is made real to you and you can only call him the Christ when you are born again cuz then and only then do you know anything about him you cannot be saved until he's made until you have that Faith all right now in doing that I realize what a lot of people's minds goes to then they'll say brother Dale you don't believe in in uh uh doing this or doing that or shouting or crying and this out of the other I don't believe that's your new birth I believe those are the manifestation of what has taken place with inside of you I I believe a baby comes into the world it's a baby and it cries but that's a part of the baby that you know is working it's something within you I believe in all kind of things that happens when people receive the new birth and all kind of experiences as far as that but remember now the experience has got to be a Biblical experience which would be meaning that the experience would have to be the same for everyone right or we would be trying to find what kind of experience we need so then we can't put it on shouting crying speaking in tongue seeing Vision seeing Angels believeing the prophet's message we can only put it on the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you there your new birth see all right so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith perfect Faith the prop I mean substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ now you you're getting into bride material what when you're isolated when you're set aside when you you've done all the things and come to that new birth but does everybody understand what I mean by see we want to say uh you must be born again and this one person will say well I done this and I was born again this other person say I done this and I was born again no the the baby comes the same I mean they may have to do cyrian and and all but we're talking about normal babies normal babies are all born the same right right all right then what they do in those things is different things right do you say I cried when I received the Holy Ghost the crying wasn't the Holy Ghost right it's the supposed to be because you received it amen right amen all right see then you're saved by grace what through faith through a revelation amen where that it's revealed to you that you're born again but it's never been re revealed to you well no I just cried and i' started going to church and I've becoming good well all right you remember the story of the man that you know read the track went and done this that the other went to different churches finally went to Brother Brandon brother brand said you you received it right back there he said you mean I had it all the time yeah but he didn't understand he had it and then there brother R speaks of his daughter-in-law think her name Lo that received the Holy Ghost one night and was doubting the next night all right see then if you put it on anything other than the revealed word of God what what what anchor do you have what bases can you put it on outside of the revealed word now I didn't say what you think I'm saying and all you do is just read the word and you're saved right I didn't say that that's right I said you can't be saved without a revelation that's what your Prophet said you can't be healed without a revelation well I just walked alone I just healed well that was the Revelation something took place all right but you see we think it's some kind of a makeup something we think the new birth is some kind of a an emotional feeling well why don't you just believe it's speaking in tongues well we we don't believe that anymore well what do you believe well now it's shouting well somebody come along beat that in a while no it's crying it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you I think it's 45 Christ M your God revealed and see that and that alone is the new birth you're only trying to put it upon some fleshly point or thought or idea when when it's a revelation all right and look what your Prophet said let's go ahead and pick up number 11 because I love this quote we will start here on it because we done way with all the ones in between and just scan along this is uh perfect Faith 1963 and we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect Faith they didn't have it because they'd had Christ walking with him you know all right but then afterwards Christ was in them see and you see it's hard to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it all right now they had the Lord Jesus walking with them right they seen the sick healed y the dead raised the great signs and wonders and they said they believed but not a one of them had Christ Living in them until Jesus Christ came back on the day of Pentecost all right we get on to that and we stay on that a lot because see that's what people do and if you can tear that down on the basis that that uh you know the Old Testament Saints had the new birth well you realize how You' destroy the entire Bible because you would only have it just in mental believing right whatever you would want to call it speaking in tongues shouting crying believing the message whatever you want to call it you would just be going up on that basis and you wouldn't see the difference between the old and the New Testament but you can't call Jesus the Christ without it being the new birth amen and the new birth never came until the day of Pentecost all right so then it was revealed to them see we looking at the upper room as people sitting with tongues of Fire coming down Lighting on them and then we see them going out and speaking in tongues and we see things happening but that was because the birth had already come see we want to make that to Birth come on right right we want to make that to birth we want something to do with it right when you don't have anything to do with a new birth other genic than accepting it right but you see if we put it on anything why wouldn't we want to put it on seeing like they did where it would talk of licks of fire sitting on each one but remember the birth is what you're talking about now you getting to the bases of the scriptures that we read in Matthew all right getting down to something that you can anchor into you remember the prophet explaining that they were set in the upper room and some of them finally come around and said hey let's just take it by faith we've seen the sick healed we've seen the dead raised we've had a Ministry we've done these things let's just take it by faith and go out and somebody says now wait a minute I'm still a little bit scared you said well that's not in the Bible no but that's pretty well explains it because somebody wasn't in an agreement with the rest of them right somebody said we got to wait what he said well they didn't know what was going to happen but they knew what they had was not able to bring forth at that time now what about it is what we have enough right will it stand a test only if it's quickened they had a pretty good foundation that they could walk out on didn't they they had a Ministry they've seen all kind of thing Happ in their Ministry but yet when that Holy Ghost came in that new birth they walked out of there they wanted to go out and die necessary whatever it was because they'd experienced something but I keep coming back to that to you and I because that's the purpose do we have something that will hold us you remember the brother Rand said during the time of your wife dying and the things happening your daughter said did you uh keep your religion he said no that it kept me all right do we have something that will hold us see the new birth is a revelation you said Brother D I've never thought about the New Birth being a revelation well why not because that's the way the prophet taught it what would it be then what would be your new birth well I was just a sinner I was out in the world and I come to church and they preached a sermon and I got under conviction I got down and prayed and I cried and and I got up and I went home and I quit drinking and smoking and running around with women and and I started going to church well you could do every bit of that and still be lost that's right sure right so you could do every B of that and still be lost I want something that I can anchor into yes sir I I want something powerful and where was it where brother R said I believe it's in perfect Faith he said let's get God's Adam Bomb now what did he say that was faith and you know what within my hand I have within the confines of my hand you'd say it enough of whatever they go through and make it to blow the world to Smither rings but I can't see it I can't smell it I can't hear it taste it or nothing right but he said let's get God's Adam Bomb Faith because see faith is something that you can't show it to nobody else if you want to base it upon a good life if you want to base it upon the things like that and all of those things goes with it right but if that's all you can Bas it on what about the condo priest according to our thinking the condo priest had more right to call it saying that he was God than Jesus did and Jesus platted a rope and run them out of the temple right see church I'm trying to get you and I to just sit down and think you know just think do I have the goods or is this just been a go to church thing yeah we was going to church before we ever heard of the prophet and some of you was more dedicated before you ever heard the prophet your now so all right but listen the church is built upon on Revelation right right was that the scripture we read and Upon This Rock This Revelation I'll build my church and now like I said while ago if his church ain't fully completed yet he's still building amen thank you Lord amen all right we're going to get down here in a little bit a couple of quotes on down to where you'll come back to what we've been talking about you and I coming to a positive attitude about what we are and where we're at but I want you to think about it what is the church or you know if the church is built upon Revelation what is it buil upon you know go ahead with number 12 brother this is from the patmas vision and how marvelous the Revelation remember now remember you cannot get it through theologians it doesn't come that way it only comes as a revelation water baptism used in the name of Jesus Christ can only be given as Revelation amen Jesus and God being the same person can only come as a revelation the whole Bible is built on Revelation the whole church is built upon Revelation he gives Matthew 17 we know it's 16 for I set Upon This Rock the supernatural Revelation I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it Supernatural Revel ation a revelation the church is buil up a revelation it's built on a substance am it's built on faith look at the next one works is Faith Express 1965 now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed to you by his grace is nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God right amen and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church is built upon the Revelation now build upon a revelation and we know that it's buil upon the revelation of who God is it's not built upon the revelation of who we are right it's built on the Revelation how many do you need of those it's built on a revelation of Jesus Christ amen personally to you all right now in doing that then look at the next one we just try to do a few of them to time but works as Faith Express this is paragraph 1 06 that was 105 we were on excuse me uh the whole church is built up on Revelation let me get it down the works of Faith Express where he says about the Baptist preacher that was the last that was the last one all right is up on it that's the reason I say him because it paragraph 105 then down to 106 the Baptist Minister told me not long ago said I just can't accept Revelation said then you cannot accept the Bible you cannot accept Christ because he is the revelation of God he God revealed in flesh therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation if you can't receive Revelation then all right so now what they do in the message form of people brother brandham had the Revelation I got the Revelation that brother brandham had the Revelation well now you better be careful because you could come up with a secondary secondhand Revelation I want something personal to me you know all right which came and I agree with all of it that it comes by hearing the word of the Lord and comes by The Prophet's message being revealed to you and I but now I want you to think for just a moment this is my point if the church is built upon Revelation was half the church built on Revelation you know or or was it all and then you'll see why we Hammer so much that Martin Luther one day said the judge shall live by faith right that was the message of that age and you realize then he the body would not have been complete had that age not taken place are you with me well we go back to it's build upon the apostles and Prophets You know oh the church is built on the and it is but remember Luther's justification of the truth was was a part of the disciples message Wesley sanctification the truth was built upon the apostles and Prophets of what they taught and the isusa street genuine was built upon what the apostles taught right but get what I'm talking about it had cut off and went into the ground back there and had to come back and look what a great Gap you would have if you only took the apostles and their Doctrine and then you jump over to the end time to where the Prophet came you realize how big of a gap you would be dealing with but see that wouldn't be buil in the church so if you don't get nothing from the message tonight remember the whole church is built upon revelation right all right but now here's where we are where we started is this whole thing just built upon brother randam was a prophet you remember what we talk they didn't have no trouble with Martin Luther until the church begin to make manifest what Luther was talking about and then they got lost a lot of members all right but you see just because a man brings us the message that don't put an end to All Things somebody's got to make the message alive your Prophet said the bride was to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 do you need that quote he said she was to Vindicated BL God it's already been Vindicated well you're just lost out go ahead and shout all you want to but what about it what about a church being built upon Revelation go to number 14 let's get to this one things that are to be 1965 1205 you see the whole whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation Jesus said in St Matthew the 16th chapter Flesh Blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you what is it a revelation of who he was right and Upon This Rock This revelation of who he was I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it so if we believe that the seed died and went into the ground had it not come back in Luther you wouldn't have an original seed in the last days right so what did he say Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what what he was in another hour what he was now the Bible Express it's growing in the bride to the full stature all right then if the church is built upon Revelation and the Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ but it's where he's at and what he's doing is building the church see we look back there and think the church was built back there you know come on is that the way you're thinking was until somebody like me comes along and jogs you just a little bit makes you think a little when you say the church is buil upon the revelation of Jesus Christ that's day of Pentecost this what they come for you don't have a complete body that's right you don't have a complete Church in the book of Acts and even though as I said we built on the foundation Apostles and Prophets Luther never added anything to the word but that part of the body could not come into being had Luther not preached the just shall live by faith and God revealed that to a group of people it wouldn't work to just stay back there well we believe what the disciples say I I used to say that when I thought there was three Gods what did you say right I used to say the Bible says father son and the Holy Ghost how many of you used to think that right we thought we had the Bible just as I said we thought on the day of Pentecost that that was all of the building of the body that there was that was just the feat the foundation now are you following me then go through the church ages and read those Church ages just the the the writings in Revelation 2 and 3 and see what was given to each church right you know what that was doing that was the revelation of Jesus Christ in that age being made known and building a body a church look where we'd be to just take that idea well there all back there heard that he built a church on death Pentecost no he just built the feat so each age has a part of the word of God to be made known and that's building the body the church the bride and look where we'd be without what they said am look where we'd be without what Martin Luther taught of the just shall live by faith are are you following me are you following me what I'm talking about some personal to you so what part of the body are you what part of the body is this age to bring forth right come on I thought the eyes was this age in the prophetic right right is that the way it goes but then I thought there was a part beyond that that the prophet spoke of called the intelligence in the Capstone you have many things that's why there there so much mistaught about the the Capstone cuz even in the Capstone you you have to even deal with the zeusa street Pentecost if you really want to get into the Capstone maybe someday I'll get back to that thought and do no it's just the end time down here uh in the anatomy of the body uh the lips is in the head the last time is his brother uh used to say last time I checked the lips was in the head and then the eyes came and then the intelligence comes we see there somebody got to make manifest a part of that age for it to be able to be part of the body of Christ and to build the body of Christ so then we look back and we see that Luther did have a part Wesley had a part ausa Street had a part the prophet had a part but somebody has got to make full manifestation in the last days for us to walk off the earth all right the Church of the Living God is built upon divine revelation not upon denomination organization not upon Creeds or doctrines but on spiritual revealed truth of the Living God in to tment 1957 it's not built upon any denomination organization Creeds or doctrines it's built upon a spiritual Revelation now the last time I checked this out it was right that uh you know you start out with a baby and it first thing is what is the the little Wiggly things the spine and then it grows and develops into parts and things but you know where it all comes from and you know it all has the same blood type uh your foot is not one blood type and your arm another blood type and and this that and the other it's all the same right the baby comes from one egg being multiplied by The Germ connecting right starts with a spine then from there gross parts of the body in other words what I'm saying is then the things that Martin Luther taught of the the Trinity is not in the word of God when he said the Jews ought to be taken out and killed because they crucified Christ that's not in the word of God but when he taught to just shall live by faith amen that was in the word of God part of the word of God part of the body of God that fit exactly the same DNA from that just shall live by faith up here with with Luther is exactly the same DNA of built upon a foundation Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone are you are you following me right we talk about a revelation we talk about faith being a revelation but you know one Revelation cannot be contrary to another Revelation that's right right you agree Luther's just shall live by faith couldn't be contrary to the disciples and brother randam took those things and preached on them and he said they was a mysterious part of justification a mysterious part of sanctification and a mysterious part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's in the seal book that in the lifetime this age that's Prophet was to pick those things up see brother random never come to bring a different Doctrine than Luther did of the just shall live by faith come on you know how the body built so much of this and so much of that what did what the prophet say said it's not so much of a dog sale so much of a cat sale so much of it no it's human sales all the way to make the human being if not we would be running around with a head like a horse and a body like a man or what is those mythology things that they used to have see that wouldn't quite work out Philadelphian Church age he says I'm going to say something now look his entire church is built upon divine revelation of himself so we get a revelation that's contrary to what the prophet brought you know right real quick where we're at and it's like I say to you which is I know it but it gets a point to go into people's head everybody saying brother Brown's wrong here and brother Brown's wrong there but there's certain things that bud they word to you that he's right about especially marriage and divorce right well you know if he's wrong over here and wrong over there then he's wrong marriage and divorce I don't mind saying it that way I didn't say what we misunderstood him as saying I said if he was wrong if he was wrong when he preached the seals then he wouldn't right that's sensible all right but Dev build upon divine revelation and wisdom versus Faith he says it like this how is a man through wisdom going to understand it when the whole Bible and the whole Church of God is built upon divine revelation by faith a revelation now remember what we've been talking about healing and salvation Etc you can only be healed by Revelation you can only be saved by Revelation and that's where people don't get their healing is because they don't know how to pray for a revelation have you ever asked God to reveal to you that you was healed I mean seriously ask him Lord give me a revelation that I'm Healed then I'll life at them doctors but see we want to life at the doctor that's go I ain't going them doctors about two weeks from now I Mighty I might try one a couple weeks now if it don't work you done lost it me it's to build upon divine revelation what's the next One Thirst to know him is life the person Christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that God built his church upon and if you don't build upon that same church listen the Bible said Able by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all this whole thing is built upon the Revelation then and unless it's revealed to you this got to be revealed to us church it's not something that we just have hazardously go along be serious about your healing see we're good to quote but what do we do with it Prophet says God Wants You healed more than you want healed well you know where the problem must be you know it must be in me I I can't blame him but then we want to profit up by saying maybe it ain't his time well that may be true but are we doubting it see if it's Revelation you won't doubt right you life it's a doctr if it's a revelation and then Revelation you better do what he says right but if it's a revelation if God is revealed to you but you see I've got one in here somewhere maybe I can find it after a while that it's what I've always tried to get you to look at that we say if I'm totally delivered I have a faith a revelation no that's a scientific fact that ain't a revelation that's a scientific fact you progress Beyond Revelation it's scientific so then we won't we don't want to just put it on the basis that well you let me get better and I'll tell everybody I'm better but until then I don't want to lie I don't want to lie about it now well you're a liar if you won't say What God Says and see to be healed in you got to say by Stripes I'm Healed and you may have to confess that for quite a while before it becomes a spiritual Revelation amen right now there's your 25 years with the Abraham and the waiting to the thing it's all right because it does work that way but if it's revealed to you you'll just call the world up what brother brother say he said if God told me to go raise George Washington or was there Abraham Lincoln or something he said I'd just call all the press and tell them to be there in the morning yeah but that's just a prophet now well I listened to it tape in the truck a lot of times when I'm writing in the church AE series and some sometimes going bring that and in that brother brandom's talking about Faith Deliverance and things see we've got to say we're healed when we have no physical manifestation that's right and then stay with it you get sicker what did the prophet say the greatest sign you are healed is for you to get sicker right it's not God's fault you know it see it's our fault for not believing and keep confessing until he can make it manifest right right now get my point of what I'm talking about would it be saving salvation healing you start out confessing and God says they're healed let's use salvation God says you're saved you you come up to justification you repent of your sins you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ following the word of God you try to go to church you start lining up and and doing better and all like that and your confession is that you're a Christian and God says they're a Christian now he knows the end of the road but he doesn't hold that against us right right and he says they're confessing it I'll confess it all right that's as long as you keep that positive confession you keep walking right on through your salvation but then somebody come along and try to talk you into a Doctrine or an idea what you need to do you need to speak in tongues you need to shout you need to cry you need to do this that and the other and then you go around telling everybody said what I'm doing now is I'm confessing I'm saved and I'm going to start doing all these other things well it might be good but just remember you're off of your original Foundation that says you're saved because salvation has nothing to do with your dos or don'ts oh there's where we don't like that one we think that we've got to do this or we got to do that I'm glad that I didn't do like brother so and so cuz he would have never saved me start your confession and then confess your way into it is that what brother R told who was John Ry the one that's blind or whatever it was go say it I was looking at him today where that he told about I think it's in super s where he told about that boy saying he was healed and a bunch of preachers got on to him about it and said you're hindering the cause quit going around telling everybody you're healed bunch of preachers you know what the one thing he said he said don't take away from me the only thing that I've got he said if you was in my shoes yeah in other words what would you do right don't take away from me the only thing I've got which was what a man's word that he was healed God's Bible saying he was healed you know them preachers was trying to take away the Revelation from the man that he was healed and you know what there he was healed right then but boy just can't you see them old preachers we straightened him out we got him straight down and God healed him job's comforters we got him we got his mind in the right Channel and God come down and healed him when they were the devil in himself right their words were but you see Church a revelation is something that you have and you can't show it to somebody else you can tell them what happened to you you can tell them the experience you had with it you can tell them the thing that you scripturally you went through and the experiences you've had or what you've seen or what you've done you can you can tell people about it but until that person has a revelation they don't know what you're talking about right right cuz you see a revelation a substance now I had these notes so now I'm fixing it jump over on another part of the message CU I want to get these two out of the way where I can continue Wednesday and then next week from Sunday on to what I was studying on you know that uh a revelation is a substance it's not a myth it's not a thought number 15 if you want to pull it up running it's not a hope he's talking about faith it's a substance things hope for it's not a wish it's a substance it's actually something that you possess yeah you possess it it's to you and you only because we're individuals it's not a collective thing that we talk about but it's a substance you have is it actually something that you possess or is it just a mental confession now he said it's not a myth it's not a thought it's not a hope it's not a wish it's a substance something you possess now substance is what anything consist of whether natural spiritual right and we know as we brought in the basis of tonight's message that the word of God is the thing that brings all things into being right worlds were framed made created brought into being by the word of God right all right now see then the healing that we need has to be spoken amen come on salvation has to be spoken by youen God's done done his part you believe in your heart you confess with your mouth remember what Bob was talking about that person talking about I don't want nobody to know what I believe because it might be dangerous one day then they don't have anything I don't care if that's somebody sitting in this building cuz he was kind of reluctant about saying it so if it is somebody sitting in this building you just remember what I'm saying okay all right but you see it's something you possess amen it's yours but you've got to say it right right you you got to speak it right because he makes intercession upon your profession is that right we say confession because it's really profession it's confession same word but he makes it upon what you say well I don't know whether I'm Healed or not well God says you know what they don't know whether they're healed or not he's just saying what you say right but when you can really say I have the substance I have the a possession look at the next one having faith in God some think that it's a mental conception of the word but that's not right faith is not a myth faith is a substance things hope for the evidence to have an Evidence it must be a substance you remember that quote might got to be a substance so it's not just something that you imagine in your mind it's something that absolutely you have it's something that you possess in your own being and what is it it's the evidence of things that you have hoped for it's the evidence of things that you do not have as yet okay but you have the authority of God to say that you have it it's an Evidence something you have in your heart now it's not something that you just kindly push yourself to I've noticed so much of that in my meetings that people try to work themselves up into something to make them believe now you can't do that you're just beating the iron but faith is something that's just as calm and settle as it can be I can call her scream amen right there because the times that I've been healed and delivered and all it wasn't a great emotional this workup or that workup or great feelings it was just it's finished it's finished all right you ever had it take away settled as this can be he taking God as his word and having the Assurance in your heart that God is able to keep what he has said that he would do and will perform everything that he said he would do confess it let me get in a hurry something that you possess remember it's not an intellectual conception of something it's a substance it's something that you possess let me read these five perfect Faith uh paragraph 33 that's something that you possess not imagination if you really have it it's just as real to you as any other thing that could be are you reading it it's just as real as you know that that you're riding an automobile it's just as real as you know that you're sitting in the church it's just as real as you hear my voice it's a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of God and that only faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God that puts it back to where your faith then is is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in a organization it's not in a group of people it's in God because God is the word see your faith is in God faith comes by hearing the word of God then when God by his word not by what somebody else did somebody else said but by what God's word said he said let every man's word be a lie and mine be a truth amen right think about it something you actually possess look at this one faith is a substance and friends when you pass by I know they have enough Faith to cure a toothache that's right and some of them coming through with cancer and say I have faith to be healed that do not have faith my scripture lesson tonight said faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of Things Not Seen see it's a substance it's something direct something that you really have not something that you imagine something that you think you have but it's some direct positive act that you have you see what I mean going to the next one that was he 19 he1 roll up or the young fell in the wheelchair now watch it he's talking about what you can do when you got faith now watch what he says about the man in the wheelchair you can Rejoice just as much When Faith takes a hole saying that you have it as you could be if you were running up and down this AIS just like you was out of the wheelchair see it's the substance of things hope far the evidence of things not seen you don't have to feel nothing you don't have to taste nothing only thing you have to do is to believe something and it becomes a positive something that you possess that is your faith right you cannot accept it by intellectual thought that's intellectual your minds will reason but Faith does not reason if you got intellectual Faith then that's just a reasoning faith you'll say well if I only was healed I could get up you see what I said want to go we say when I'm Healed I'm say I'm heal heal I'll say it then you know I say it everybody knows it we sure a man sitting there and he gets something takes off something took place you know have to explain it now your mind your faith does it and you say if I was only he if if I only was healed I could get up if I only was healed this lump would leave if I only was healed I'd feel better if I only was healed the doctor would tell me so but when you've got faith all the doctors in the world could never tell you anything different you possess that it's the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen what is it it's an actual substance something you possess why because it's been revealed to you okay salvation's been revealed to you right healing has been revealed to you see he builds his church upon the revelation of his word and he's still building that's righten until that last one comes in he's still building and you know what he ain't ask us how to do it he just does it but he's revealing it every person that was ever born again was born again the same way that's one thing we don't like right right right yes CU we got it all figured out how I done it and other people didn't do it and I got it cuz I done it I thought ever baby came water blood baby right that's what I thought well I thought every Born Again believer according to uh John if I if I get it wrong the scripture but anyhow where it says when Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born again you must be born to water and spirit I thought he was explaining the new birth of what would have to take place to every Born Again person see the birth is the same the sensations is what's different right you know I don't mean this wrong I've always said it that it's try to be truthful brother R said one time he said where you're born again at has a lot to do with you he said if you're born in a great an emotional situation you'll be emotional if you're born again where it's just kind of quiet and I was born again under brother Mo you know he didn't give my new birth but he was our preaching or whatever that night and I guess that's just the way I am I'm just settled and I don't have to have all of the emotions I don't have to get up every day and say Lord would you let me feel good today and shout and cry would you let me be happy I told my wife the other day I the greatest sermons I've preached I the way I count it the greatest sermons I've preached in the past 5 years that I've ever preached in my life the depth and the thoughts and understanding but yet most of my time I feel like I'm backslid not that I'm out doing wrong don't get the idea okay it's just that I'm not made to be emotional up built and things and I don't have to have it you know I don't have to be told every day that I'm a Dale to for me to believe that that was solved a long time ago you know I don't have to have feelings and things but yet I love them and don't you ever think that this man doesn't believe in feelings and signs and wonders I've told you my experiences in my life and you know it I've seen things that most people have never seen I've felt the presence of the Lord that most people have never felt but yet I don't have to have that I've always told you I could come to this church and not have one note for a sermon but yet on I'm not all nervous what am I going to preach I don't know what am I going to preach I just got a lot of confidence in the God that I serve that he'll give me something you know what he's never failed me yet so I ain't never worried about it but you see we build everything on emotions and feelings and things instead of it being on the word of God but brother Dale you don't know you you don't understand me I'm not against emotions I believe in emotions I believe anything that's got life to it going to have some emotions but yours is different from mine right see I'm not a what you call a prayer Warrior come on Brothers I'm not what you call a prayer Warrior Warrior I'm sorry there's people that are prayer warriors that they can pray we used to together and I've told you many times brother Tatum and brother George and brother Mike Canada and then we used to get together and they they could just pray and just pray and just pray and it wouldn't nothing to be an hour for them to just be praying and I'm over there sitting reading my Bible because I've done prayed I I've done said what I wanted to say and there was no need of me saying anymore so I just get my Bible sit down and start reading but you say well you just wasn't emotional okay but I've had God to answer a few prayers that I've asked him and I'm sorry that I'm not see prayer warriors are like who was the man oh I get their name wrong but moody or one to of them that he went into a town where who was the one that would go through town and the factories would just shut down and and this things would happen one of the Great Men back there and you know what he would do he'd find a bridge going into town he'd find a prayer Warrior he' put him under that bridge and said you stay there and pray don't come to the surfice stay under the bridge and pray see when people cross that bridge is already under the anointing of the Holy Ghost there's people that are prior Warriors that that's their calling mine is just to be sit down this is it and if there this is not it let me keep this until that gets here cuz I'm happy like I am because I believe it's the word faith is a revelation we're going to talk next about a sense of Faith a sense of Faith then when we're going to talk about faith being the six sense then we're going to play a tape we're going to play a tape for brother Brandon CU you see church I believe the word is true let's stand together what we got brother 142 this SP book 142 this amen anybody have a need the alar is open we call I want to get a clth fix to go into some serious I'll giveus world you heard our brother and been request that he ask Lord there a serious matter there about problems and things but we just believe you you said the biggest portion of it was finished when our brother got up and walked up here to ask us to pray with him so we believe you we send a prayer call just as a contact to be between us we believe your word by your stripes Lord by your life by your doings all will be made possible for whatever we have need of in Jesus name just believe it you have a need come and let's believe but if you ever had God to just say something to you just in your inner being just hading to speak to you and in that you can just say Thank you lord always wondered about that now it's settled didn't break the world down blow it all up did it just speaking to us but then we got to go I hope you followed my line we've got to speak it you got to say you're healed you got to say that you're saved you have needed something speak it and walk forward Jesus said ask anything in my name it'll be given unto you well you know a lot of times we ask and I hope this come that right we ask and that's good but sometimes he wants us to say it so D he wants us to say it go speak it go speak it when it's going totally contrary it's going totally contrary to what you thinking you say it anyway what's the matter it's not propping up something or trying to make something work up or no that doesn't work anyway but when you get down serious and you get to thinking Lord I have a need you don't come on the scene I don't know what's going to happen you know what try try the spirit see whether they're of God or not you know I'm not trying to practice something up enough to get you to build up Faith to practice and practice there's no such thing but we're getting in the way that we won't just speak it and walk forward but you know what it means to speak and walk forward amen how is it that we do when we dedicate a baby here we dedicate everybody in the building to live right that's right to show that child Christ don't worry worry about it you asking for something that's a Miss it's going to not come but when you're sincere ask him and see what we got one more let's go a little bit Glory Glory Glory remember the service Saturday Bible study and remember Sunday and our brother coming to speak to us remember the feast fry some of you are supposed to bring cakes bring different things let's have a good time
