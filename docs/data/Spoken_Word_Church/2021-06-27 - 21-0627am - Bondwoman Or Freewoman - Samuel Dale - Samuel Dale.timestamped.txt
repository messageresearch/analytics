[2:10] take care of her and you you just keep
[2:12] her in your prayers okay
[2:13] galatians 4 and father we thank you
[2:18] that there's a day of grace and time as
[2:21] our brother was ministering unto us
[2:23] about your grace your unmerited favor
[2:26] to each one of us and to be able to lord
[2:29] to
[2:30] take your word just open the pages and
[2:33] to read it
[2:34] and to see your grace and what it is to
[2:36] each and every one of us
[2:38] and how that you've manifested yourself
[2:40] in many ways down through time
[2:43] to bringing it to that position that we
[2:45] can all depend upon you
[2:47] and to walk in the light of your grace
[2:49] bless those that are not here today
[2:51] remember brother allen and sister anna
[2:53] there brother house mr audrey for
[2:56] all the others brother colley brother
[2:57] dardy lord we miss all of these sister
[2:59] johnny sister gene
[3:01] we miss these lord and we pray that you
[3:03] would just restore unto us these that
[3:06] are sick
[3:07] we know that we're all getting older but
[3:10] that has nothing to do with it
[3:12] because we rest in you not in time we
[3:14] love you and we thank you
[3:16] have your way now forgive our sins
[3:18] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[3:20] keep us
[3:21] in jesus name amen
[3:25] galatians 4. now i'm going to have to
[3:28] pick this up in two or three
[3:30] parts maybe but we'll see how it works
[3:32] out
[3:34] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[3:37] a child
[3:37] differs nothing from a servant though he
[3:40] be lord of all
[3:42] all right now paul is explaining the
[3:46] fact of
[3:46] law and grace and bringing it down
[3:50] to the position to understand and see
[3:53] what we are
[3:55] see but we're we're we're ours as long
[3:58] as we're the children
[3:59] we differ nothing from a servant we've
[4:01] been through these
[4:02] messages before but we're under
[4:05] tutors and governors until a time
[4:08] appointed of the father
[4:10] even so we when we were children
[4:13] were in bondage under the elements of
[4:14] the world
[4:16] but when the fullness of time was come
[4:18] god sent forth his son
[4:20] made of a woman made under the law
[4:23] watch now to redeem them that were under
[4:26] the law
[4:27] that we might receive the adoption of
[4:29] sons
[4:30] okay and because ye are
[4:34] sons in other words the reason
[4:38] your sons reason that you are in an
[4:40] adopted stage
[4:43] is because of what god has done for us
[4:46] and putting us in place now
[4:48] so listen wherefore there aren't no more
[4:49] a servant
[4:51] but a son and if a son than an heir of
[4:53] god through christ
[4:55] amen so now let's drop over just pick
[4:58] our thought up
[4:58] to the 19th verse
[5:02] chapter 4 19. my little children of whom
[5:05] i travail in birth again
[5:06] until christ be formed in you i desire
[5:09] to be
[5:10] present with you now and to change my
[5:12] voice
[5:13] for i stand in doubt of you in other
[5:15] words they had come
[5:16] if you get the whole background of the
[5:18] story the galatians were having trouble
[5:22] under the basis of the law all right
[5:25] and in other words they were wanting to
[5:27] lean back to
[5:28] keeping the sabbath days keeping this
[5:31] day or keep that day or keep this thing
[5:34] or or wear this clothing or eat this
[5:36] food or take this
[5:38] certain day off and all of this that and
[5:39] the other they were having trouble doing
[5:42] that and paul is trying to explain
[5:44] to him and that's why i started over
[5:47] here with the adoption see
[5:49] bring you into the family by the new
[5:52] birth
[5:53] then pick that up and go on with it
[5:56] and to see that we no longer have these
[5:59] things
[6:01] because we're different now remember the
[6:04] story if you don't
[6:05] don't forget this whole point now listen
[6:07] we're going to cover the bondwoman and
[6:08] the free woman
[6:10] but now we're going to have to cover it
[6:11] under the natural
[6:15] before we can cover it under the
[6:17] spiritual see because
[6:18] under the natural jew
[6:22] you had two things
[6:26] now we've got to bring that over into
[6:27] the new testament what i said we may
[6:28] have problems getting it
[6:30] to where we can understand but listen
[6:33] my little children to whom i travail in
[6:35] birth again until christ be formed in
[6:37] you
[6:37] i desire to be present with you now and
[6:39] to change my voice
[6:41] for i stand in doubt of you tell me ye
[6:43] that desire to be under the law
[6:46] do you not hear the law for it is
[6:48] written
[6:49] that abraham had two sons the one by one
[6:52] made the other by a free woman but he
[6:56] who was of the bondwoman was born after
[6:59] the flesh
[7:00] but he of the free woman was by promise
[7:05] which things are an allegory or type or
[7:07] a shadow all right
[7:09] for these are the two covenants the one
[7:12] from mount sinai
[7:14] which generous to bondage which is agar
[7:17] in other words hagar
[7:18] coming on over into the point and this
[7:21] agar is mount sinai in arabia an answer
[7:24] to jerusalem which now is and is in
[7:26] bondage with her children
[7:29] but jerusalem which is above
[7:33] is free now not jew that's a natural
[7:37] okay all right you see where we've got
[7:38] to pick it up which is the mother of us
[7:40] all
[7:40] right for it is written rejoiced thou
[7:43] barren that bears not break forth and
[7:45] cry thou that travel us not
[7:47] for the desolate hath many more children
[7:49] than
[7:50] than she which hath and husband now we
[7:54] brethren
[7:54] as isaac was none of what
[7:59] are the children of promise but as then
[8:02] he that was born
[8:03] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[8:05] born after the spirit
[8:07] even so it is now all right
[8:10] see people are still arguing and fussing
[8:13] well we're supposed to do this we're
[8:14] supposed to do that we're supposed to
[8:16] keep these days we're supposed to do
[8:17] you know they're still arguing over it
[8:20] but what's nevertheless what sayeth the
[8:22] scripture
[8:24] cast out the bondman and her son
[8:27] for the son of the bondman one woman
[8:30] shall not be heir with the son of the
[8:31] free woman
[8:33] so then brethren we're not children of
[8:36] the bondwoman
[8:38] but of the free now who said
[8:42] who was the first one that said cast out
[8:48] the bond child that's what we'll deal
[8:51] with today so you may be seated the lord
[8:53] had his blessing
[8:56] for the reading of the word all right
[9:01] now get my point listen
[9:04] very carefully to the point
[9:07] there was two nations that developed out
[9:11] of abraham
[9:13] you technically can say one developed
[9:15] out of abram
[9:18] all right because that would have been
[9:20] ishmael
[9:23] and the other developed out of abraham
[9:27] after the name change after the promise
[9:29] and and things like that
[9:30] and that's well and good to keep your
[9:32] thoughts in mind
[9:34] because see then you can declare that
[9:36] one
[9:37] is by uh natural
[9:42] lineage in the natural lineage
[9:46] to abraham through
[9:49] through hagar there was no promise of a
[9:52] child there was promise of a nation
[9:55] promise over the things we'll read in a
[9:56] minute this nation and all like they
[9:58] will promise that too
[10:00] uh you know ishmael gets his nations
[10:02] they're over there right now
[10:05] and all but see there is a an israel
[10:09] there now that is still not
[10:12] lined up in the promise
[10:15] so you're going to have to pick up the
[10:17] point of seeing what paul is talking
[10:19] about
[10:20] there is two natural nations right
[10:24] ishmael on one side isaac on the other
[10:27] side
[10:28] all right and both of them have the
[10:30] promise under the point as i said about
[10:33] ismail gets promise of land he gets
[10:35] promise of
[10:36] of great things to take place and great
[10:38] nations
[10:39] come out of ishmael
[10:42] but see the promise come through isaac
[10:46] all right and see we have to pick that
[10:48] up to to understand now
[10:50] now get the point now the flesh man
[10:55] or isaac you know he was flesh
[10:59] let me put it this way both seed
[11:05] both seeds now come from abraham
[11:09] amen whether it be the jew
[11:13] or whether it be the
[11:16] i don't know what you call them over
[11:17] there now the palestinians the this out
[11:19] of the order
[11:20] the people of their the lineages coming
[11:22] down from that side
[11:24] but remember both of them comes from
[11:26] abraham
[11:28] you call you didn't go through as i said
[11:30] for abram was this one over here through
[11:33] ishmael and abraham's that's good
[11:37] but remember one thing you and i are not
[11:39] jews
[11:41] so what is paul talking to the galatians
[11:44] about
[11:48] see why is he talking to them as a
[11:51] natural
[11:52] people he's explaining the natural laws
[11:55] the things of who they are
[11:57] he's telling the the the uh galatians
[12:01] you know
[12:02] you're this you're that you're you're
[12:04] the seed of promise
[12:06] whether it would be that you would wind
[12:08] up being
[12:09] from ismail or from isaac
[12:12] you've got promises for both but one of
[12:15] them
[12:16] will linger back or lean back to the
[12:18] flesh
[12:21] the other will lean to the promise
[12:24] all right in doing that then see there's
[12:26] your developing of two nations that you
[12:28] have aware right now
[12:29] fighting each other
[12:34] all of those little nations around there
[12:36] in one way or the other
[12:38] are in relation now notice where i said
[12:41] it's on one way or the other they're all
[12:43] in relation
[12:44] one to the other connecting to abram or
[12:47] abraham
[12:49] they connect back to abram and the bases
[12:51] that that
[12:52] they come from the flesh of abram
[12:56] now the two seeds that we cover so you
[13:00] get into that we'll cover that later
[13:01] going through it
[13:02] and all but remember both
[13:06] children come by a natural sex act amen
[13:10] right yes right whether it be ishmael
[13:15] or whether it be isaac amen all right
[13:19] see we look at isaac as being a promise
[13:22] and that's true
[13:24] but still where did he come from amen
[13:29] where did he come from he come from
[13:30] abraham amen
[13:32] right because that's where that that you
[13:35] keep your
[13:36] thoughts in line but then when you get
[13:38] to the book of galatians
[13:40] paul is not necessarily dealing with
[13:44] israel and isaac
[13:48] he's dealing with the children of
[13:51] promise
[13:54] all right because remember now watch
[13:56] what i'm getting at follow the point and
[13:58] then hold this point
[14:01] both children came from the same man
[14:06] right ismail came from abraham
[14:10] isaac came from abraham amen all right
[14:13] but now we've got to get down to
[14:15] eventually to where we can cover the one
[14:17] seed which is christ
[14:19] because abraham and abram and abraham
[14:22] would be two seeds
[14:26] so then that's why paul is trying to
[14:28] explain to the galatians
[14:30] that they were trying to lean back to
[14:32] the law to do that they wanted to follow
[14:34] the law
[14:35] they wanted to keep the law they wanted
[14:36] to do those things
[14:38] and paul is saying why are you doing
[14:39] that
[14:41] don't you understand
[14:45] that you're trying to lean this way
[14:46] you're trying to lean that away you're
[14:48] trying to lean back to
[14:50] whether or not you come from ishmael or
[14:51] isaac
[14:56] why are you worried about which one you
[14:57] come from oh
[14:59] but but we are the children of of of
[15:02] ishmael
[15:03] all right according to the korans and
[15:05] the writings and the things
[15:06] you know who the promised son is
[15:10] isaac no ishmael
[15:13] amen your arabs and things are claiming
[15:16] the ishmael to be the promised son
[15:18] and isaac to be the bad guy you know to
[15:21] come up
[15:22] you know right so you understand
[15:25] it's it's a great situation to look at
[15:28] it
[15:28] but yet to try to understand it in the
[15:31] order of understanding
[15:32] and and not just drop off this see
[15:35] you'll drive well we're the seat of
[15:36] promise
[15:38] we're only at the seat of promise
[15:39] through jesus christ
[15:43] and paul is not talking to or dealing
[15:47] necessarily with the isaac and ishmael
[15:49] situation
[15:50] to the galatians he's dealing with the
[15:53] galatians as
[15:54] being gentiles
[15:57] the bride of christ
[16:00] now as i said
[16:03] then you've got one man fathering both
[16:06] nations
[16:09] right amen
[16:12] come on as i said you can pick up all
[16:15] you want to and play with it we do it we
[16:17] believe it
[16:18] is will come from one isaac come from
[16:20] the other but it's only in the basis of
[16:22] whether it would be
[16:23] abram or abraham it's still the same guy
[16:27] the same guy's the daddy of both of them
[16:30] but now here's the catch to it that we
[16:32] will get to in another message or so
[16:34] down the road
[16:36] not so with the woman
[16:41] amen not so with a woman
[16:48] and the woman you got two different
[16:49] women
[16:51] that's right
[16:54] they get babies but you got two
[16:56] different women
[16:58] one of them is through hagar
[17:01] the other one's through syrah
[17:05] all right so now you've got two women to
[17:07] deal with
[17:11] all right and that's why he's covering
[17:14] it see
[17:15] that we have this situation that the
[17:18] bondwoman
[17:22] is to be cast out
[17:26] all right now that bondwoman being cast
[17:30] out
[17:30] is not the bride of christ or even the
[17:33] natural point of
[17:34] of trying to understand it's just laying
[17:36] it in order to get it right
[17:38] you got one man two wives
[17:43] i don't care what you think about the
[17:45] promises is through this
[17:46] and the promises is through that you can
[17:48] get into all of that but paul ain't even
[17:50] covered because remember
[17:51] paul's talking to the galatians the
[17:54] galatians were
[17:56] were the point of gentile situation
[18:00] because of where they're coming in at
[18:03] are the bride of jesus christ paul is
[18:05] talking about the bride amen
[18:07] right he's talking about he's only using
[18:10] that as a type
[18:12] he's only using uh abraham as
[18:16] abram or abraham or whatever as a type
[18:18] or a shadow
[18:19] something to look at to where you can
[18:21] get a he's talking about
[18:24] whether or not you right here in lula
[18:27] georgia today
[18:29] can decide which side are you on
[18:37] because remember we just read in verse
[18:40] 26
[18:44] that jerusalem which is above is a
[18:46] mother of us all amen
[18:49] all right but see you get in the mind of
[18:52] looking and wondering what is paul doing
[18:54] he's talking to the galatians
[18:58] he's talking about the bondwoman and the
[19:01] free woman
[19:02] all right but yet what does a bondwoman
[19:06] and free
[19:06] woman have to do with christianity
[19:10] you know what does it have to do with
[19:14] you as christians
[19:17] because we are not the bondwoman of the
[19:19] free woman
[19:21] we're the bride of jesus christ
[19:25] because paul is covering the natural as
[19:26] the bondwoman
[19:28] as being hagar and the natural
[19:33] as sarah as being the
[19:36] free woman right
[19:39] but neither one of them applies to you
[19:41] and i we're not jews
[19:47] we're born again christians
[19:51] we are the bride of christ not the bride
[19:54] of abraham
[20:00] all right getting you to look at the
[20:02] bible in a different situation
[20:04] and to try to understand it why would it
[20:07] be talking to the why would he be
[20:09] talking to the galatians
[20:10] and telling the galatians you desire to
[20:13] be under the law
[20:14] when the galatians are not the jew
[20:17] are naturally you know they are they was
[20:19] in there there was jews in all of that
[20:21] back there in the early parts
[20:24] but paul's talking to the bride of
[20:26] christ
[20:29] i've been pondering this for months as
[20:31] to us to thought because
[20:34] it will eventually wind up to see that
[20:36] the seeds shall not be out with a shuck
[20:41] brother brown said this is an unusual
[20:46] thought seed shall not be air
[20:49] with a shop
[20:53] well see there has to be a division then
[20:55] come along somewhere
[20:56] that you'll see that that has to divide
[20:59] between
[21:01] and when you do you're going to see one
[21:03] going one way and one going another
[21:06] and in doing that you're going to see
[21:10] that when the prophet made that
[21:11] statement it was perfectly
[21:14] right because first off thinking in your
[21:16] human mind
[21:17] it should not be the point of saying the
[21:20] seed shall not be aired with a shock
[21:23] it should be that the shock shall not be
[21:25] aired with the seed
[21:30] that should be the correct statement
[21:33] that the shuck shall not be aired with a
[21:35] seed
[21:36] all right you can go that line i can
[21:38] carry you through that line and it
[21:40] will come out and we will but he's
[21:42] saying these
[21:43] seeds shall not be air with a shock
[21:49] right that's the titles to the message
[21:52] all right
[21:53] then in doing that that seed shall not
[21:55] be air with a shock
[21:57] because the shucks going one way for
[21:59] certain
[22:01] but the genuine bride's going another
[22:03] way
[22:06] then it will fall in line and i'll drop
[22:08] back on this later on then it will fall
[22:10] in line to see
[22:16] that the shucks go into the tribulation
[22:23] i don't care what they are that's right
[22:26] they're going to the tribulation amen
[22:30] but the seeds not going to the
[22:31] tribulation
[22:34] seed's going in the rapture the royal
[22:36] seat of abraham
[22:38] who is the royal seat of abraham the
[22:40] bride of jesus christ
[22:42] so now you understand what i'm saying
[22:43] the book of galatians is not writing
[22:45] about the jews and their lineages and
[22:47] their doings and what they're doing
[22:48] there and
[22:49] and all because he's not writing to them
[22:53] about that he's writing to born-again
[22:55] believers who are in jesus christ
[22:57] that he said that to an adoption
[23:01] children heirs
[23:05] right what was he covering the heirs the
[23:08] people
[23:11] the bride of jesus christ is what he's
[23:13] talking about
[23:15] see i want to know why the bride's not
[23:17] going with us
[23:19] why the the free woman's not going with
[23:22] the bondwoman
[23:23] amen because both of them are wives of
[23:26] abraham
[23:32] both of them by children to abraham
[23:40] see then abraham had two had a
[23:44] separation
[23:44] in that point that naturally
[23:48] he brought forth
[23:51] ishmael through hagar
[23:58] no promise purely
[24:01] sex act sorry to say it that way but
[24:03] it's plain language so it must be plain
[24:06] we're old enough to understand
[24:11] nothing in promise the only promise it
[24:14] was that
[24:15] that god looks down and all right let's
[24:18] let's go on
[24:19] let's let's get the point but who i
[24:22] asked you
[24:23] who was the first one that talked about
[24:26] the bondwoman
[24:29] and what was to happen
[24:35] so let's get in the bible and and study
[24:37] a little bit go back to
[24:38] to uh go ahead and pick up number one
[24:44] brothers
[24:49] all right which would be genesis 21
[24:53] and sarah saul
[24:56] the son of hagar the egyptian
[24:59] which she had born unto abraham monkey
[25:02] now she saw
[25:03] sarah saul hagar the egyptian
[25:07] which had bore abraham a son ishmael
[25:10] now what wherefore she said unto abraham
[25:18] cast out the bondwoman and her son
[25:23] for the son of the one woman shall not
[25:24] be heir with my son
[25:27] even with ishmael
[25:31] or isaac now listen
[25:36] why would sarah
[25:41] be so adamant
[25:45] when she first said she saw she was
[25:48] looking
[25:48] and and uh you know uh
[25:52] in other words they claimed really that
[25:54] basically uh
[25:55] isaac was a little long about weaning
[25:57] from his mother maybe three or four
[25:59] years old you know as a background story
[26:00] to a lot of different things
[26:02] and all like that and and ishmael he
[26:05] kind of made fun of him
[26:06] because the ishmael was born to hagar
[26:09] before
[26:10] isaac was born to sarah okay are you
[26:13] following me
[26:14] so in doing that sarah looks at it
[26:18] and remembers sarah is the one that set
[26:21] this whole story up
[26:27] she set up the situation for hagar to
[26:32] bear abraham or abram if you want to
[26:34] hold them keep them
[26:36] a son and she said then i'll take that
[26:40] son
[26:41] which was the right of all of the do it
[26:43] i'll take that son
[26:44] and i'll bury it unto myself
[26:47] and said abraham now that'll fulfill the
[26:49] promise to you
[26:54] but abraham he said no
[26:58] this ain't exactly working because what
[27:01] i got now is a problem
[27:04] now listen i've got within me
[27:10] the ability the seed etc
[27:13] to bring forth but said i don't have a
[27:16] wife to bring forth
[27:19] so sarah said okay take hagar
[27:24] she'll be a wife and she'll bury you a
[27:26] child
[27:28] but said remember now i'll take that
[27:30] child to me
[27:34] because i can't have any
[27:37] and the law of right was for that child
[27:39] to come to her
[27:41] and she would raise it as her own child
[27:44] all right so sarah is getting in line
[27:48] pretty good we throw off on sarah
[27:51] we throw off it she done this she set up
[27:53] that
[27:54] she set this situation up
[27:57] you know what god turned around and said
[28:00] listen to her
[28:03] no wait a minute now she's in trickery
[28:07] she's in all kinds of things he's doing
[28:09] all kinds of situations and god says
[28:12] okay now abram abraham said
[28:15] just listen to her
[28:21] she gets all upset when
[28:26] isaac comes forth as a child to be
[28:29] weaned and
[28:30] ishmael starts making fun well you know
[28:34] probably
[28:34] probably if the truth was known hagar
[28:37] was making fun at the same time too you
[28:38] know because of the sun
[28:39] i mean just put it all together but it
[28:41] doesn't matter just get it straight
[28:44] then she started making you know
[28:47] he started making fun
[28:51] and you know what would have happened
[28:54] had sarah not come up with this idea
[29:00] you would still have two lineages
[29:04] and you'd have a problem in israel
[29:09] but just remember one thing that i tried
[29:11] to explain to start with
[29:13] we're not dealing with that fact of
[29:15] isaac in israel
[29:16] i mean it's on the basis of whether or
[29:18] not they're jews or what we're doing
[29:20] we're seeing what is paul relating to
[29:22] you and i am
[29:29] why is it in the message people then
[29:31] especially years ago they're beginning
[29:33] to get away from a lot of but a lot of
[29:34] it was legalistic preachers right
[29:36] all you could do would beat the women
[29:38] over the head for this that or the other
[29:39] and all of these things and
[29:40] all of that was in the situation
[29:49] but listen cast out this bond woman
[29:53] and her son
[29:58] said now listen abraham we got a child
[30:00] now
[30:02] come on by then they had a child
[30:06] said we got a child we got a promise
[30:09] you told me that god promised you a son
[30:12] you told me that he promised a son
[30:15] through you
[30:18] here we have the son we no longer need
[30:22] hagar we definitely don't need
[30:27] ishmael
[30:30] cast them out
[30:37] now what does god say
[30:40] okay
[30:47] 4 4 she said unto abraham
[30:50] cast out the bonds woman and her son
[30:54] for the son of this bondwoman shall not
[30:56] be air with my son
[30:58] even with isaac the thing was very
[31:02] grievous
[31:03] in abraham's site because of his son he
[31:06] loved ishmael
[31:08] that was his first son
[31:12] but god said unto abraham
[31:16] let it not be grievous in thy sight
[31:19] because of the lad in other words about
[31:22] ishmael
[31:24] and because of thy abundant
[31:28] one woman in all that sarah has said
[31:31] unto thee
[31:32] hearken unto her voice for is in isaac
[31:38] shall thy seed be called now watch him
[31:41] and also of the son of the blind woman
[31:45] well i make a nation because he is thy
[31:47] seed
[31:48] okay now show me whether abraham ever
[31:51] denied the seed
[31:52] he doesn't to this day they may deny him
[31:57] but as i said the korans and the things
[32:00] all of those doctrines over there they
[32:01] have
[32:03] ishmael as the promised son
[32:07] the jews have isaac as the promised son
[32:11] that's what the argument is that's what
[32:12] the killing is over that's what the wars
[32:14] are over
[32:15] because they're two different nations
[32:18] but from the same man
[32:20] but not from the same woman
[32:28] see one of them's a bondwoman the
[32:30] other's a free woman
[32:34] all right bondwoman is hagar
[32:38] but the free woman
[32:42] it's sarah amen
[32:46] she was the one the promise was to come
[32:48] through and through abraham was to come
[32:51] through
[32:51] abraham now whether it be abram and then
[32:54] abraham i keep doing that because
[32:56] people they'll do it to you you know
[32:58] they say well he don't know what he's
[32:59] talking about
[33:00] he don't keep it straight well i keep
[33:02] repeating it where it'll be straight
[33:06] you got one abram abraham whatever name
[33:10] you want to call it
[33:12] you got one guy with
[33:15] two seeds
[33:18] you say wait a minute no no we ain't got
[33:21] into christianity yet come on
[33:22] when you get into christianity you've
[33:24] got to come to one seed into galatians 3
[33:26] 16 which is under thy seed which is
[33:28] christ
[33:31] it ain't neither jew or gentile they
[33:32] don't have nothing to do with it that's
[33:34] what paul is explaining he's
[33:35] explaining then what are you arguing
[33:37] about these things what are you trying
[33:39] to figure out which lineage you're from
[33:41] you're trying to figure out whether
[33:42] you're ishmael or isaacs
[33:44] and said they don't have nothing to do
[33:46] with it right then because neither one
[33:48] of them is the promised son
[33:50] isaac was not the promised son the lord
[33:53] jesus christ is the promised son
[33:57] isaac was the natural promise
[34:00] because it has to be a natural why
[34:02] because it's a natural on each side you
[34:03] got one man with two seeds
[34:09] that's why it's not you don't look at
[34:12] christianity
[34:13] maybe sometimes the way i do i know it
[34:15] i'm crazy in
[34:16] in my thinking but i look at something
[34:18] and i think well hey there's
[34:20] there's two seeds but we spent so much
[34:22] time talking about one seed well okay
[34:23] let's get to one seed right
[34:26] like that so the only way you can get to
[34:28] one seed right is not isaac
[34:30] nor is one but it's jesus christ
[34:34] galatians 3 16 until i see which is
[34:37] christ
[34:38] singular
[34:43] see paul is explaining to born-again
[34:46] christians
[34:49] that they're trying to be under the law
[34:51] they're trying to be under their
[34:53] uh uh you know they're doing their thing
[34:56] they want to lean back to that they want
[34:57] to go to the circumcision paul had
[34:59] trouble with them all the time
[35:01] you know with timothy and the different
[35:02] things of circumcision
[35:04] amen
[35:10] but see we look at it and say well what
[35:12] is he talking about
[35:13] paul is not talking about the jews
[35:16] in the he has to because he's
[35:19] backgrounding it
[35:20] he's typing it
[35:23] but he's not talking about that the
[35:25] galatians are
[35:26] are ishmaelites or or canaanites or who
[35:30] do i answer they are what they are
[35:34] paul is explaining
[35:37] the new birth
[35:41] right amen come on
[35:44] are we back over here and as i said
[35:47] isn't it a very odd thing
[35:50] from there in genesis that sarah
[35:58] wanted to cast out the bondwoman
[36:03] when she was the one that helped set up
[36:05] the situation that the bondwoman came
[36:06] into existence
[36:12] maybe one of these days we're going to
[36:13] find out the bride of jesus christ is
[36:15] very important to god
[36:16] and he does listen to her
[36:19] maybe we're going to learn one of these
[36:21] days what our position is and where
[36:22] we're to live
[36:24] that we are the bride of jesus christ
[36:27] we're not jew gentile samaritans
[36:29] whatever we are we're not any of those
[36:31] things
[36:32] right we're the born again believer amen
[36:36] the only free woman that there is is a
[36:38] born-again believer
[36:40] in the bride of jesus christ
[36:44] and see israel is in the isaacs and the
[36:47] situations in that sarah and hagar
[36:49] is only tops and shadows to come to see
[36:51] who we are paul is talking to us today
[36:56] not to the jews back there amen
[37:02] tell me you that desire to be under the
[37:04] law tell me you that desire to
[37:06] uh well i won't do this i won't do that
[37:08] i won't do it i can't do this i can't do
[37:10] that
[37:10] legalisms
[37:14] that's right you think your legalism is
[37:16] what perfects you
[37:18] no the blood of jesus christ is what
[37:20] makes us all what we are
[37:22] how is there any hope for a gentile to
[37:25] wind up being the bride of christ don't
[37:27] you ever think like that
[37:29] don't you ever think about what god done
[37:31] to get me and you
[37:32] amen amen it looks like he done
[37:35] everything wrong
[37:36] he listened to hagar
[37:40] he said well no god didn't well he told
[37:42] abraham to listen to her
[37:47] but see we don't follow the story we
[37:49] don't line it up then we want to take
[37:50] hagar
[37:51] to things and just chuck her out the
[37:53] window
[37:54] but remember when hagar when sarah and
[37:57] hagar had their dispute
[37:58] and hagar went her way abraham had to
[38:01] send her out
[38:04] god found hagar under the tree with
[38:06] ishmael
[38:11] and god told us that he will bring forth
[38:13] a great nation
[38:15] nations will come out of this man
[38:19] to go on back
[38:22] to be under subjection to sarah
[38:25] read your bible that's all i'm doing be
[38:29] under subjection to sarah
[38:32] because see sarah had the idea
[38:37] now we throw off on her so much about
[38:39] that she persuaded abraham
[38:45] i don't think it was a lot of persuading
[38:46] going on i think abraham saw a time to
[38:49] get his wife
[38:51] he had one wife and couldn't get no
[38:53] children
[38:54] so he's trying to figure out how to get
[38:56] a child that god had promised him
[38:58] right now he promised him he's going to
[39:01] have a child
[39:02] he didn't tell him right off it's going
[39:04] to be by sarah
[39:06] he left him a long time before he ever
[39:08] come to him and finally said sarah how
[39:10] this child
[39:11] well this is after sarah's done had the
[39:12] child now sarah's saying behavior
[39:15] to god
[39:18] you get abraham to cast this woman out
[39:21] because she can't be there
[39:25] he says he's not talking about who is
[39:26] she talking to she was talking to
[39:28] abraham
[39:29] but abraham was under her god
[39:33] and he was telling her and she said no
[39:35] that ain't the way to work it out
[39:40] so this is the way to work it out cast
[39:41] out that bond
[39:45] first off get rid of the bondwoman
[39:48] then what's your first off in
[39:49] christianity
[39:52] justification see if you don't have time
[39:55] to do nothing else get the messages on
[39:58] the seed shall not be air with the shuck
[40:00] there's two or three of them
[40:02] and listen to them if we get time we'll
[40:04] go through those things
[40:06] of talking about because in the story of
[40:09] brother branham using those things he's
[40:11] using
[40:11] sarah as the husk which was the the
[40:14] uh methodists and the different things
[40:18] is being described by the prophet as
[40:20] those things are going on
[40:21] but this has got to be described here
[40:25] this is the point that i'm wanting to
[40:27] get out first hagar had the idea
[40:31] to get a child by i mean sarah had an
[40:34] idea to get the child by hagar
[40:36] and they got it
[40:40] but yet abraham began to realize about
[40:42] that time hey wait a minute this is not
[40:44] my promise
[40:46] i got this by flesh
[40:50] well if you don't see it then you maybe
[40:52] need to but you get into legalism you're
[40:54] automatically going to the flesh
[40:59] do this don't do that eat this don't eat
[41:02] that
[41:02] wear this don't wear this do this see
[41:06] that what do
[41:07] what is it legalism paul is explaining
[41:11] to the born-again christians
[41:14] that it didn't work with isaac and
[41:18] ishmael
[41:23] neither one of them brought the promise
[41:28] isma was the natural promise yes but he
[41:31] was not the seed
[41:36] because isaac was from the seed of
[41:40] abraham
[41:42] ishma was from the seed of abraham two
[41:46] seeds
[41:48] you've got to break that down to get rid
[41:49] of one of those or something's got to
[41:51] take place
[41:51] because you can only have one seed in
[41:53] christianity you don't have two seeds in
[41:55] christianity there's no point of it
[41:58] that's why you don't believe in the two
[41:59] souls the two lords the two this or two
[42:01] that they always got to have two in the
[42:02] message
[42:07] what would paul be saying you galatians
[42:12] tell me you that try to have these seed
[42:14] and that seed and that seed or how many
[42:15] seeds
[42:16] because in galatians you only got one
[42:18] seed galatians 3 16
[42:19] of thy seed which is christ
[42:25] he said what are you driving at i'm
[42:27] talking about me and you here i'm not
[42:29] talking about the jews back there
[42:32] that's the only the type or the example
[42:34] of it
[42:38] we are the bride of jesus christ
[42:42] one seed
[42:50] but yet why do we wind up with so many
[42:52] of them
[42:54] i hope you don't go wrong on me listen
[42:56] but you got your two lords your two
[42:58] souls your two this
[42:59] you always got two
[43:02] and paul is constantly trying to get rid
[43:05] of
[43:07] them two things and he's saying it
[43:11] didn't work
[43:12] in the natural
[43:15] because what i wound up with in other
[43:17] words god said what i wound up with
[43:20] is two different kingdoms two nations
[43:25] and they're sitting over there right now
[43:27] fighting each other over the land
[43:29] both of them claiming the promise as
[43:30] being theirs
[43:33] right
[43:37] but it's unto thy seed which is christ
[43:41] do you understand what i'm saying why is
[43:43] paul used it what's he doing with the
[43:44] galatians
[43:45] he's not preaching to the jews
[43:48] not naturally there were jews there
[43:50] there were people in all of those
[43:51] because the jews were the
[43:52] biggest portion of the christian realm
[43:54] as we call it up into the first church
[43:56] age
[43:58] right so don't misunderstand me as to
[44:01] what i'd say when i say they were not
[44:03] they were not jews
[44:07] the jewish kingdom was to end it back
[44:10] there when jesus christ came and gave
[44:11] his life and brought it forth
[44:13] and it brought forth a spiritual kingdom
[44:17] all right and unto thy seed which is
[44:20] christ
[44:22] paul two or three hundred years i mean i
[44:26] don't know exactly how long maybe 30 40
[44:28] years here
[44:29] from the time and paul is explaining
[44:33] the new birth
[44:38] right come on are we in the scriptures
[44:47] god said unto abraham let it not be
[44:51] grievous in thy sight because of the
[44:53] lead
[44:54] because of the bond woman why because
[44:57] see the
[44:58] here's the the free woman is wanting to
[45:00] throw everything out
[45:02] and he says don't be grieved about it
[45:04] because of thy because of thy bond woman
[45:07] and all that sarah has said unto thee
[45:09] hearken unto her voice
[45:12] for in isaac shall thy seed
[45:15] be called all right now watch him
[45:18] tell me that and also other son of the
[45:22] bundle
[45:22] i will make a nation because he is thy
[45:26] seed see the way that most people are
[45:30] trying to bring it they try to bring an
[45:31] uh uh israel you know a children of
[45:34] israel
[45:35] through isaac and throw away
[45:40] throw away the ishmael that's always
[45:42] been the point get rid of this
[45:44] you know the ishmaelites
[45:48] why they have a promise
[45:52] there will be a lot of those people be
[45:54] given eternal life at the white throne
[45:56] judgment
[45:59] right a lot of the jews a lot of the
[46:01] people because over there in israel
[46:03] right now what are you going to call it
[46:07] come on they are both the seed of
[46:10] abraham
[46:11] that's right if you go over there and
[46:13] stand out there you'll hear them in the
[46:15] in the day the horn they'll get out and
[46:18] they'll blow it at certain times of the
[46:19] day
[46:20] well that's a call of prayer
[46:27] the ishmaelites are the ones that's
[46:30] calling the prayer
[46:32] right sister barbara it's not the jews
[46:35] that are calling the prayer is it
[46:40] it's the ishmaelites
[46:45] the ones from hagar because they believe
[46:48] that they're the promise
[46:50] they believe ishmael was the one that
[46:53] isaac was to
[46:54] offer i mean that abraham was to offer
[46:57] up
[46:57] back there see they changed the whole
[47:00] story around
[47:03] what have we done with it
[47:07] tell me you that desire to be under the
[47:09] law why do you want to go back to those
[47:11] dates and times and fees seasons and
[47:13] doing
[47:14] paul said i'm scared of you brother
[47:16] brown said i'm scared of your experience
[47:19] now i got this in my notes right here if
[47:21] you want to he said i'm scared of your
[47:23] experience
[47:24] unless i've bestowed labor and vain in
[47:26] other words
[47:28] trying to get to the galatians to see
[47:31] that it's not ishmael and isaac
[47:34] that's only a types and shadows it's
[47:36] christ
[47:39] it's the new birth
[47:43] we don't need to try to find out our
[47:44] lineage
[47:46] even if you found out which side you're
[47:48] on what good would it do
[47:53] right what good would it do for you to
[47:55] find out you were a jew
[48:00] because paul says later on in the
[48:01] scripture it's not a jew that's a jew
[48:03] outward but it's a jew that's inwardly
[48:08] the new birth makes you a jew inwardly
[48:11] puts you into the correct position
[48:14] of the free woman's child
[48:19] because now let's take that for a minute
[48:21] see the bond woman
[48:24] hagar and her doing the bondwoman well
[48:26] what about the free woman
[48:32] you and i are the free woman right
[48:36] sarah is not the free woman
[48:39] no more than than is than isaac was
[48:44] the seed of promise it's all in jesus
[48:47] christ
[48:51] amen see the bride of jesus christ is
[48:53] the free woman
[48:57] she's not a bondman she's a free woman
[49:00] by promise
[49:05] sabra was by promise
[49:08] the true savior would come the child
[49:14] amen
[49:16] get into the christianity with it get
[49:18] into the real thing instead of just
[49:20] thinking about two nations
[49:22] well see then when you start thinking of
[49:24] two nations you've got to automatically
[49:25] do away with one of them
[49:27] because you're knowing that much of it
[49:28] is right in it but it won't work you
[49:30] can't do away with anything
[49:31] that's right the ishmaelites are over
[49:34] there
[49:36] they got their promise there'll be some
[49:38] of them given eternal life at the white
[49:40] throne judgment oh yeah
[49:45] but you know what israel as a nation
[49:49] is a nation with god but israel is not
[49:52] the promised nation
[49:53] the promised nation is the bride of
[49:55] jesus christ the free woman amen
[50:00] that comes by promise
[50:05] see we're not jews we're the bride of
[50:09] jesus christ
[50:10] and that's what paul is trying his best
[50:12] to explain to him
[50:14] did you listen to the reading of the
[50:15] scriptures
[50:23] let's see
[50:27] but after that faith has come we are no
[50:29] longer
[50:31] under a schoolmaster for we are all the
[50:34] children of god
[50:35] by faith in jesus christ
[50:38] come on i'm in four or three and three
[50:40] and 26.
[50:42] for as many of you as have been baptized
[50:45] into christ
[50:46] have put on christ
[50:50] there is neither jew nor greek
[50:54] listen there is neither bond nor free
[50:59] there is neither male or female for we
[51:01] are all one
[51:02] in christ all of that back there was
[51:06] just
[51:06] types and shadows to come to you and i
[51:09] right and if you be christ
[51:13] then you are abraham's seeds singular
[51:21] and heirs according to the promise
[51:25] then what is he starting to describe
[51:27] listen to him and i say that to air
[51:30] as long as he's caught he's explaining
[51:31] adoption right stature of perfect man
[51:33] adoption coming
[51:34] so we've been lord of all and you're
[51:36] under tutor schoolmaster
[51:38] same word governor same word unto the
[51:41] time appointed
[51:42] of the father even as we when we were
[51:45] children
[51:46] were in bondage under the elements of
[51:48] the world we were all sinners lost
[51:50] but when the fullness of time was come
[51:52] god sent forth
[51:54] his son made of a woman made under the
[51:57] law
[51:58] to redeem them that were under the law
[52:00] that we might receive the adoption of
[52:03] sons
[52:06] adoption was originally placed to be to
[52:08] the jews
[52:10] because they were the children of god
[52:13] but they teared down that right they
[52:16] lost their right of sonship when they
[52:18] turned down jesus christ and crucified
[52:20] him
[52:21] so they're no longer in promise of the
[52:23] line of adoptions and things
[52:26] but it turned to the gentiles see
[52:30] what and because your sons god has sent
[52:33] forth the spirit of his son into your
[52:35] hearts crying
[52:36] abby father see adoption galatians i
[52:39] mean romans 8.
[52:41] wherefore there are no more a servant
[52:44] but a son
[52:45] if a son then an heir of god through
[52:47] christ
[52:48] right explaining adoption
[52:52] the statue of a perfect man the great
[52:54] development
[52:55] not of a natural jew
[53:01] that was not who he was talking to he
[53:03] was talking to the galatians
[53:08] which was to be the bride of jesus
[53:10] christ
[53:12] see the bride of jesus christ is the
[53:13] free woman
[53:17] that's why it doesn't say
[53:21] see it says the seed shall not be aired
[53:23] with a shuck
[53:25] it doesn't say that shuck won't be out
[53:27] with a seed
[53:29] because there is a redemptive part to
[53:31] israel that they will come forth and be
[53:33] given eternal life and different things
[53:35] but yet they will never come into the
[53:37] position
[53:38] of free woman
[53:42] they'll always be israel now listen
[53:46] follow what i'm saying and listen israel
[53:49] will
[53:49] always be the bondwoman
[53:56] because you can't be the free woman
[54:02] jesus christ
[54:05] set that up with the birth of he when he
[54:07] come into this world
[54:09] and made a way for to die for our sins
[54:12] and made us his children his offspring
[54:14] his errors who is it talking about why
[54:16] is he talking to the galatians about
[54:18] our ship or what to do how children are
[54:21] to be how you're supposed to raise them
[54:22] and things
[54:23] he's not talking to the israel
[54:27] he's talking to the true israelite which
[54:30] is the true israelite is the bride of
[54:32] jesus christ
[54:32] the free woman so the bondwoman will
[54:37] never
[54:38] be air with a free woman but isn't it
[54:41] odd
[54:41] who put her out
[54:47] who come up with the idea get rid of the
[54:50] blind woman
[54:57] which was sarah
[55:00] and sarah if you'll listen to the
[55:02] prophet's message and you'll see
[55:04] sarah represents the
[55:08] methodists and things coming down
[55:09] because you've got this and representing
[55:11] this as representing that
[55:12] listen but you've got a very odd
[55:15] statement when you get over there
[55:17] to where that brother branham says even
[55:22] mary
[55:25] was not the seed
[55:30] you remember that marrow was not to see
[55:33] why the seed was in mary
[55:37] sarah was not the seed seed was in sarah
[55:41] where did this where did isaac come from
[55:48] comes from sarah right
[55:53] ishmael comes from hagar
[55:58] well still hagar is top of the bat of
[56:01] the uh
[56:02] lutherans coming forth and see when you
[56:05] get to going then
[56:06] then you'll see why the prophet said the
[56:07] seeds shall not be aired with a shovel
[56:09] right amen
[56:10] but the main thing is what he gets to
[56:12] the life of everybody is covering it
[56:14] this the shuck is going to the
[56:17] tribulation
[56:21] now not sarah and and not lutherans and
[56:24] wesleyan methods there
[56:26] are the bride of jesus christ
[56:30] they're not going through the
[56:31] tribulation well because
[56:34] the jew i mean the the justification
[56:37] same case and baptism in the holy ghost
[56:38] already finished by now
[56:40] they won't go the new birth is for the
[56:42] royal seat of abraham which is the bride
[56:44] of jesus christ
[56:46] count yourself the honor that you're
[56:48] sitting in amen
[56:51] that's all i'm trying to say
[56:57] the bible is not talking here in
[56:59] galatians of jews and gentiles
[57:01] that's what he said he said neither jew
[57:02] and a greek neither bond they're free
[57:09] but it's in jesus christ that all things
[57:11] rest
[57:14] we are the royal seat of abraham by the
[57:17] new birth
[57:21] and that's why it comes down to be one
[57:22] seed then
[57:24] because we're the children of abraham
[57:26] one seed
[57:28] now remember the story of what i'm
[57:29] getting out of you listening when you
[57:31] got the story started
[57:33] you got an abraham and isaac
[57:36] you've got an israel and a hagar you got
[57:39] all kind of stories coming down
[57:41] but you got it to one thing
[57:45] that's two seeds but as long as you got
[57:49] two seeds
[57:49] you've got
[57:53] i trouble mean to be wrong i just mean
[57:55] to be straight when you've got two lords
[57:57] you've got a problem
[57:58] that's the only thing that i tried to
[58:00] explain to those people back there
[58:01] 20 40 years ago about the two lords and
[58:04] you've got two lords you've got two gods
[58:06] because you've got to have a god for
[58:07] each lord that's sensible
[58:12] so there is not a god for isaac and a
[58:15] god for ishmael
[58:18] but there is a god for the bride of
[58:21] jesus christ
[58:22] one seed singular which is christ
[58:27] you just think about what you are you're
[58:29] not a jew
[58:31] it's not a judas where it's a jew that's
[58:33] inwardly you're the new birth you have
[58:35] the part of being christ in the new
[58:36] birth right
[58:37] you're born again now you're jews
[58:40] inwardly not outwardly
[58:43] i don't want to be a physical jew
[58:46] i want to be what i am amen but to
[58:49] realize what i am
[58:51] that's what i'm trying to get you to see
[58:54] the bible is not written
[58:56] this far we say the jews it's written to
[58:59] the bride of christ
[59:03] it tells about israel and all of her
[59:05] doings
[59:06] but it's telling it in types and
[59:08] shatters of typing what we are now
[59:10] amen we're his offspring
[59:17] come on is that the book of acts where
[59:19] paul said that was on mars hill and said
[59:21] we are his offspring
[59:25] we're the children of god amen we're the
[59:28] born-again believers of god
[59:31] why do we need a book of rules to live
[59:33] by
[59:34] well brother don't you think it's good
[59:36] to be good no i think it's good to be
[59:38] born again
[59:40] if you get born again you'll be good
[59:43] right that solve the problem
[59:47] if you get born again it takes care of
[59:49] whether you're good or not because it's
[59:50] not how good i am it's how good he is
[59:55] i like that one where he said he that
[59:57] hath made us and not we ourselves
[59:58] we are his people in the sheep of his
[1:00:00] pastor
[1:00:02] amen all of that on predestination
[1:00:06] all of that on the choosing all of that
[1:00:08] things are standing now for you to
[1:00:09] understand
[1:00:10] this day to try to get it to the right
[1:00:12] place who is the
[1:00:14] bondwoman and who is the free woman
[1:00:19] i don't want to be the bondwoman's child
[1:00:22] i don't care if they give me all of
[1:00:24] israel i don't care if they give me all
[1:00:26] of that land
[1:00:27] i don't want to be that i want to be of
[1:00:30] the free woman
[1:00:31] which is jesus christ coming and
[1:00:33] bringing us by
[1:00:34] promise see the natural bond woman
[1:00:38] brought a man by sex
[1:00:43] the spiritual brings it back by new
[1:00:46] creation
[1:00:49] makes us the children of god amen
[1:00:52] his offspring are you listening
[1:00:57] just trying to get a thought to you and
[1:00:59] then we'll pick it back up maybe in
[1:01:00] another message or something
[1:01:01] because i want you to see it who is paul
[1:01:04] talking to
[1:01:06] that the air as long as he's a child
[1:01:10] he differs with nothing he's a child
[1:01:13] you know i mean you go over there and
[1:01:16] you pick up one of them little bitty
[1:01:17] little bitty arab and you shake him up
[1:01:19] down you know you got a little kid you
[1:01:20] reach over and get a junior you shake
[1:01:22] him down you got two little kids
[1:01:24] i love both of them it doesn't matter
[1:01:28] but see in the finality it comes down to
[1:01:30] prove which one is to be what
[1:01:32] by the fact of what that child will do
[1:01:38] i don't want to be just a a a p
[1:01:41] a people of a tribe of israel which
[1:01:43] tribe are we
[1:01:44] we got to tell us we got that you got
[1:01:46] arguments the over the tribes and the
[1:01:48] things you know the 144 thousand and
[1:01:50] this that
[1:01:50] no i want to be part of the bride of
[1:01:54] christ
[1:01:56] i want to be of the free woman
[1:02:03] what about a man like abraham having to
[1:02:05] take his
[1:02:06] son ishmael and throw him out
[1:02:12] he loved him he wanted to keep him
[1:02:16] he throwed him out why because
[1:02:20] the free woman said it
[1:02:25] that don't mean nothing to you but it
[1:02:27] certainly means a lot to me
[1:02:30] because i'm going to stand up for that
[1:02:31] bride of jesus christ i don't care how
[1:02:35] much you argue and fuss with me about
[1:02:37] all these things
[1:02:38] you're not going to get nowhere downing
[1:02:41] the bride of jesus christ
[1:02:45] but uplifting christ you're on my side
[1:02:50] because i believe in the spiritual
[1:02:56] more than the physical amen because if
[1:02:58] you're listening to the physical
[1:02:59] abraham had two seeds he planted one in
[1:03:03] one woman one in the other one
[1:03:04] he wound up with two children out of
[1:03:06] that you can't deny the point right
[1:03:11] but god kept separating separating he
[1:03:14] would even have to use sarah to separate
[1:03:16] with
[1:03:17] to say do this and do that he kept
[1:03:19] separating until he wound up with
[1:03:24] isaac but that was not his promised son
[1:03:30] that's the promised son in the natural
[1:03:32] jesus christ is his promised son
[1:03:36] and by the new birth we become the
[1:03:37] children of god
[1:03:40] now we can fit into the galatians tell
[1:03:42] me the you know they do is that about
[1:03:43] the air as long as he's an air he's no
[1:03:46] different
[1:03:47] but let him become into a childhood let
[1:03:49] him come in to adoption let him come to
[1:03:51] the statue of a perfect man
[1:03:52] let him gather into all of these things
[1:03:56] and see it
[1:04:00] one more before we go
[1:04:07] go ahead with number three this one
[1:04:10] quote
[1:04:10] from brother branham on the seed shall
[1:04:12] not be air
[1:04:14] with the shuck he's talking about the
[1:04:17] seed hanging on you
[1:04:19] i like that see the spirit's speaking
[1:04:21] watch now it's true
[1:04:23] i said the seed shall not be air with a
[1:04:26] shuck
[1:04:27] that's a very strange text
[1:04:31] and like i said it looked like it'd be
[1:04:33] the other way
[1:04:34] you read it just read it the seed shall
[1:04:36] not be however to show it looks like it
[1:04:38] should be saying
[1:04:38] the shock shall not be aired with a seed
[1:04:44] huh no i ain't worried about that
[1:04:46] chuck's going its way i'm going my way
[1:04:53] the shuck won't be no part but the bride
[1:04:54] of jesus christ does not have to go
[1:04:56] through the tribulation
[1:04:57] but the seed of abraham the natural
[1:05:00] now listen the natural seed of abraham
[1:05:03] whether it be from isaac or israel
[1:05:05] the natural person unless he gets born
[1:05:08] again
[1:05:08] is going through the tribulation yes
[1:05:10] right or die before whatever you know
[1:05:12] right true because he has no place to go
[1:05:18] but the royal seat of abraham the bride
[1:05:20] of jesus christ
[1:05:26] that's a very strange text but the seed
[1:05:28] shall not be aired with a shock
[1:05:31] and from taking drawing my conclu
[1:05:33] conclusions
[1:05:34] on this of my text rather from galatians
[1:05:37] 4 27
[1:05:39] 3. paul here of course is speaking of
[1:05:42] the literal seat of abraham's
[1:05:45] two sons
[1:05:48] all right two
[1:05:51] sons
[1:05:54] you have to let god do the separating
[1:05:59] and that's why you don't want all of
[1:06:01] this two and three
[1:06:02] the two-ness and a one you want to be
[1:06:05] born again
[1:06:06] and be in the body of jesus christ come
[1:06:08] on musician
[1:06:10] and be ready to go against that day
[1:06:12] because we're at that day
[1:06:15] we're the seed of abraham by faith in
[1:06:17] jesus christ amen
[1:06:19] all right the bondwoman
[1:06:24] the shock shall never be free
[1:06:27] now listen just a second the shock shall
[1:06:30] never be free
[1:06:33] like the seed
[1:06:36] it's needed to be because the shuck
[1:06:39] cannot do that
[1:06:41] but the seed that comes from that point
[1:06:43] is the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:46] and it brings her to a perfection
[1:06:49] in jesus christ
[1:06:53] the seed shall not be our with a shuck
[1:06:56] chuck's going to the tribulation going
[1:06:59] into rapture
