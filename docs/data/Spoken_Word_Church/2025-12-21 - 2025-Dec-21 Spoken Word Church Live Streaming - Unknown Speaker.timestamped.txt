[10:42] ways are past finding out, aren't they?
[10:46] Wonderful Lord.
[10:49] How sweet it is to trust him.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; I'm just sure you've had a wonderful
[10:54] time tonight.
[10:56] Just opening the door there a few
[10:58] moments ago and hearing Sister Gertie
[11:00] sing that old song, Keep Holding On.
[11:05] Just one more hour. It brought back
[11:08] memories of a my little church when it
[11:11] just before I left the other time to go
[11:14] into the fields of mission work.
[11:17] I'm looking out at a seek God first here
[11:21] in front across this old beam. I
[11:23] remember Sandy Davidson painted that on
[11:25] there about 25 years ago.
[11:28] On the other side, I think it's got
[11:31] where will you spend eternity? Think
[11:34] right here was
[11:36] uh a woman at the well. Daniel in the
[11:40] lines. [clears throat] Oh my. Many
[11:43] things has happened since then.
[11:46] Just about 5:00 this afternoon, I got
[11:49] emergency call to come about 30, 40
[11:53] miles down the country here of a dying
[11:55] woman and a very precious friend,
[11:58] Georgie Carter's mother. And I knew
[12:01] there was plenty ministers sure to hold
[12:02] till I got back. Edith has been very
[12:05] bad, too. And while we were there, the
[12:09] Lord God moved on the scene. Sister
[12:11] Carter is a long ways from dying. So, so
[12:15] we're grateful for that.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; And now it's getting time for communion
[12:20] service pretty soon. I think it's about
[12:23] 12:00 when they go to What time have you
[12:25] designated to give it?
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Any time beginning now after this at
[12:32] 11:30?
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Just any time. We How many is to take
[12:36] communion tonight? Let's see your hands.
[12:38] Let's Oh, that's wonderful. All right. I
[12:41] want to speak just a word or two. Maybe
[12:44] I'll lay my watch out here for about 10
[12:47] minutes, 15. We'll start communion now.
[12:52] Do you love him?
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; And I know you've had a great time,
[12:56] haven't you?
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Well, if you're a brother Thomas kids
[13:00] and sister [clears throat] kids
[13:02] &gt;&gt; all the way down from Ohio, I guess he
[13:04] been up.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's fine. I hope it's on tape and
[13:08] I'll get it. you know, they don't give
[13:11] up. They're just a few days under a
[13:14] hundred. But um but uh that's what keeps
[13:17] me courageous to see people like that.
[13:21] Think I'm an old man and before I was
[13:23] born, they was preaching the gospel.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; And then here I am an old man and they
[13:28] if they can't get out and make their
[13:30] voice ring out, they just take a tape
[13:32] recorder and go from hospital to
[13:34] hospital, house to house preaching the
[13:36] gospel. That's mighty fine. Amen. And
[13:39] I'm sure happy for them and for all
[13:42] those who's anticipated and this the
[13:46] services here and now remember we'll
[13:48] announce it now the Lord willing just as
[13:51] soon as the church is finished which
[13:53] they claim will be about the 10th of
[13:55] February while we're the Lord willing we
[13:59] want to take at least eight or 10 or
[14:02] days or maybe two weeks on those seven
[14:05] seals of revelations And uh we'll send
[14:10] out cards to visiting people from around
[14:13] from home here and let them know uh
[14:16] plenty time ahead. So if they take a
[14:18] notion to come, well, we sure be glad to
[14:21] have you here. And maybe the Lord will
[14:24] give us another display of his presence
[14:26] like he did the last time when we got
[14:27] through the seven church ages.
[14:31] You ever want to pray for somebody? Why?
[14:33] Remember me all the time because I'm one
[14:36] who really needs it. Now, I'm kind of
[14:39] ashamed myself to take up these 10, 15
[14:42] minutes here to say a little something
[14:43] before we start,
[14:45] &gt;&gt; but let's bow our heads just a moment.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[14:51] &gt;&gt; oh, the battle will be over someday,
[14:55] &gt;&gt; and there will be no more sick to be
[14:57] prayed for, and there will be no more
[15:00] sinners to repent. But Father, while
[15:03] this day is what it is, let us work
[15:06] while we have light to work in. For the
[15:08] hour cometh when no man can work. Now
[15:12] for just a few moments, Lord, I'd feel
[15:15] bad if I did I closed off this year
[15:17] without saying a few more words. Help
[15:20] me, Father. I pray and I might say
[15:23] something that would plain courage in
[15:25] the heart of thy people
[15:28] that we could leave here tonight after
[15:30] taking the communion and we realize that
[15:32] in the communion there is strength.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Israel took the communion first down in
[15:37] Egypt and walk 40 years without their
[15:40] shoes wearing out or their clothes
[15:43] getting threadbear. And out of two
[15:45] million people, there wasn't a feeble
[15:47] one among them when they come out of the
[15:49] wilderness. Lord, let us remember that
[15:51] tonight as we approach this great hour
[15:56] in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[16:01] If I should speak the context that I had
[16:03] wrote down that I was going to start on
[16:05] this afternoon, we'd be here at 5:00 in
[16:08] the morning. But I want to read just a
[16:11] word
[16:12] &gt;&gt; from
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you from Ephesians the 6th chapter
[16:17] 12th verse. And just for a few moments
[16:19] now that for courage. For we wrestle not
[16:22] against flesh and blood, but against
[16:25] principalities, against powers, against
[16:28] rulers of darkness of this world,
[16:31] against spiritual wickedness in high
[16:33] places. Spiritual wickedness in high
[16:37] places. And I'd like to draw from that a
[16:40] little uh 10 or 15 minutes context or
[16:44] text rather. I want to call it the
[16:47] contest. A contest is a test of
[16:50] strength.
[16:52] And we um where we have the
[16:56] uh test strength. We used to have the
[16:58] idian used to put a fire and they would
[17:02] put so many men on this end of the rope
[17:04] and so many on this end and the the tug
[17:07] of war, the contest of strength would
[17:10] pull the losing party across the fire.
[17:13] And now uh we know there's many things
[17:18] and we could base this up on for a few
[17:20] minutes of of contest, but I want to
[17:24] speak for these minutes quickly upon the
[17:27] greatest contest there is that's between
[17:29] the church and Satan.
[17:33] That great strength of Satan.
[17:38] And we want to speak of the great
[17:40] strength of God in his church
[17:44] now.
[17:46] This great contest has been going on for
[17:49] many years. It started in heaven and
[17:53] Satan was kicked out into the earth and
[17:55] then he become a enemy to God's people.
[18:01] And since then, he's used all of his
[18:03] strength and his strategy to try to pull
[18:07] God's people across the fires or into
[18:11] his fires.
[18:13] And we know that who has the most power,
[18:18] God does.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; And God, when he gave his people, the
[18:23] best thing that he could to combat Satan
[18:27] with was his word. Now because the word
[18:31] is God and who's stronger than God?
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; So the word is God and the word
[18:41] becomes our strength. God in the church
[18:46] becomes his strength to pull Satan to
[18:49] his own fires.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; That he has made. And the tug goes on.
[18:55] Now, Jesus said in Mark 16, "In my name,
[18:59] they shall cast out devils." Now, I know
[19:03] that's an old uh uh saying that people
[19:08] or there is an old saying that and it's
[19:11] not so old either. People don't believe
[19:14] in demons in this day.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; No. [clears throat]
[19:16] &gt;&gt; But the thing to do to my opinion is
[19:19] know your enemy.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and know your enemy and train
[19:28] uh for the contest that you're going to
[19:31] have when you meet him.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to meet him.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; And know him. Know his know what his
[19:41] strength is and then train for this
[19:44] contest when you do meet him or it's one
[19:48] thing sure you're going to meet him. And
[19:51] so you train for the contest. Now
[19:57] training for a contest is just like a
[19:59] boxer.
[20:01] His uh his uh enemy that he's going to
[20:06] meet out there in a contest to fight.
[20:10] A real good fighter usually knows and
[20:15] studies his opponent,
[20:18] studies his licks, knows where he fights
[20:21] far, whether he leans forward, hangs
[20:24] back, fights right-handed or
[20:25] left-handed. He studies all this. And
[20:28] then if he's a good, smart fighter, he
[20:31] gets him a sparring partner that'll
[20:34] fight just like his opponent fights. for
[20:37] he'll know all of his licks when he gets
[20:40] to that place. And I think that's a very
[20:43] good thing for Christians to do.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. And now, if you want to
[20:48] start training, start with John 3:16,
[20:52] the golden rule. Start right out with
[20:54] that. And that'll get you on the floor
[20:57] and then train for the for the knockout
[21:00] punches because you're going to have to
[21:03] use them. Everybody knows that you have
[21:06] to train to hit your enemy. And always
[21:08] God uses his word. We must remember that
[21:12] God uses his word to defeat his enemy.
[21:17] If God could think or could have give
[21:19] his people anything better to defeat the
[21:23] enemy with, he would have done it. So,
[21:25] as I've always said, when God makes a
[21:29] decision, that's the best that there is.
[21:32] He never has to alter his decisions.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; So the first decision God gave his
[21:38] people in the Garden of Eden to combat
[21:42] the enemy was his word. They were
[21:45] fortified with his word. And now the
[21:49] enemy is going to study the art of
[21:53] strategy with the word. And now Satan
[21:57] studied that all out so perfectly that
[22:00] when he come to Eve, he had the the best
[22:03] of strategy he could use upon her. And
[22:06] that was to reason with the word. Now,
[22:10] you never want to reason with God's
[22:13] word. Just believe it.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; Don't try to explain it. Don't try to
[22:18] figure it out. Now, you cannot figure
[22:20] out God. So God is the word and it's
[22:24] just made to believe
[22:26] &gt;&gt; and that's our strength. Just accept the
[22:28] word and anyone knows that a seed in the
[22:33] right kind of ground will produce its
[22:35] kind. And we just take the word and now
[22:40] Eve began to stop to reason when he she
[22:44] quoted the word to him and God said you
[22:47] should not eat thereof for the day you
[22:48] eat thereof that day we die. And Satan
[22:51] never disagreed with her. He said,
[22:54] "Certainly, that's right." But he said,
[22:56] "You see, you need some new light,
[22:58] something a little different from what
[23:00] God said. And if you do do it, you'll be
[23:02] just a little smarter. Your eyes will be
[23:04] open." But she said, "Well, God said we
[23:07] would die." He said, "Oh, surely." See,
[23:10] there you come.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Just that much. Surely you won't die,
[23:15] but God said you would. And that settles
[23:18] it. And that that brought that great
[23:21] &gt;&gt; tug of war then and pulled the whole
[23:25] human race into death
[23:28] &gt;&gt; because Eve listened to a reasoning
[23:32] against God's word. Now it's a shame
[23:37] that she did it, but it's done past. But
[23:40] now we're still fortified. And that link
[23:43] was made up in Christ Jesus. We know
[23:45] that God gave us our best defense just
[23:49] simply to trust his word. You know, and
[23:51] many say today that there is no such a
[23:54] thing as a devil.
[23:57] Uh they believe that it's just simply a
[23:59] thought. They believe that and there's
[24:03] people that believe that that if the
[24:06] Holy Spirit is a good thought and the
[24:08] devil is a bad thought. But if you
[24:11] notice when the Bible speaks of the Holy
[24:14] Spirit, he said when he the Holy Spirit
[24:17] has come and he's a personal pronoun.
[24:21] See, so he he is a person and the devil
[24:26] is a person and demons are persons.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, they are demons and they they come
[24:35] in many ways, but they think it's an
[24:37] oldfashioned idea. The man was arguing
[24:40] me here a few weeks ago. He said, "You
[24:43] know what you do? You just set those
[24:46] people's mind to thinking something when
[24:48] you uh uh tell them that thing. It's
[24:50] just a change of thought. I met that
[24:54] very same thing in India one time when
[24:57] those holy men there where we had I
[25:00] believe the largest audience I ever
[25:02] spoke to and one standing audience been
[25:05] a half million people. And I caught it
[25:09] by discernment in the spirit. And um
[25:13] they would see the Holy Spirit call
[25:16] people and call them out in to the
[25:20] audiences and tell different things and
[25:23] catching their thought. The Ray Jaws and
[25:26] the Holy Man, they said he's reading
[25:29] their mind. So a few moments about five
[25:34] or six had passed through the prayer
[25:35] line and a blind man come through and he
[25:40] was totally blind and his eyes were as
[25:43] white as my shirt. And I said, "Now here
[25:47] is a blind man. Anyone can see he's
[25:49] blind."
[25:51] And I said, "If I could help him, I
[25:53] would do so. But the only way I could do
[25:55] would be by a gift to maybe say
[25:59] something that he has done and that
[26:02] would give thought that if God know what
[26:05] he has done he certainly will know what
[26:07] he's going to do.
[26:09] So I said now looking at him I said now
[26:13] he's a worshipper of the sun. He's been
[26:16] blind 20 years and when the interpreter
[26:18] said it that was right. I said he's a
[26:21] married man. He his wife is rather small
[26:24] and he has two sons. One about 719. That
[26:28] was exactly right. Call their names what
[26:29] it was. Then out in the audience in the
[26:33] place where the people were there come
[26:36] that wave in its mental. It's um
[26:41] something on the order of of a psychic
[26:45] reading of their mind. that I thought,
[26:48] Lord, if you'll just help me,
[26:53] I I need your help, Lord. These people
[26:56] are trying to classes of telepathy,
[27:00] and it's not. And you know it, Lord. And
[27:04] yet, I'd given the scripture that's
[27:06] Jesus said he did nothing till the
[27:08] father showed him. And then turning to
[27:11] look at the man again,
[27:13] I saw him just above there in a vision
[27:16] with just as good eyes as I have. I
[27:19] thought, now is the time.
[27:22] I said, this man is a worshshiper of the
[27:26] sun. Now, and he's gone blind. I said,
[27:30] now the there's the Mohamadan priest and
[27:33] there's the the priest of the six chains
[27:36] and the different types of religion,
[27:38] Buddha. Now this man wants to receive
[27:43] his sight. Now you would say that he ex
[27:47] he he worshiped the creation instead of
[27:50] the creator. I believe that too. But
[27:52] here we sat tonight. I said and we've
[27:54] been today I was entertained in the
[27:57] James Temple where 17 different
[28:00] religions was there to interview me and
[28:03] every one of them against Christ.
[28:06] Every one. And I said now and many of
[28:10] you man was down there. Now if Christ is
[28:13] so wrong then this man wants to be right
[28:17] and surely the God of creation who made
[28:20] the world will be the only one who can
[28:22] give him his sight. That's reasonable.
[28:25] And I said now if any of you people the
[28:28] Mohamadan here is the leading religion.
[28:31] If the Mohamadan priest will come here
[28:33] and give him his sight then I'll follow
[28:37] or if the Buddha priest will come give
[28:40] him his sign.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; But let the God who made him, the God,
[28:46] somebody's God somewhere,
[28:48] &gt;&gt; cuz there has to be.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; We can't have a creation without a
[28:52] creator.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; And it'll take a creator to create sight
[28:56] in these eyes. He'd been blind 20 years
[28:58] from looking at the sun, thinking he'd
[29:00] go to heaven if he didn't. A man
[29:03] ignorantly done that. I said, "What
[29:04] would you Buddha priest do? You just
[29:07] change his way of thinking. You'd say
[29:08] he's wrong. They worship their dead
[29:11] ancestors. Now I said, now uh you'd
[29:13] think he was you'd say he was wrong, but
[29:16] what would you do? You change his way of
[29:18] thinking. Now I said, what would the
[29:20] Mohamadan do? Change his way of
[29:22] thinking. The six genes and so forth
[29:24] change your way of thinking. I said, we
[29:26] had the same thing in the United States.
[29:29] The Methodists all want to make all the
[29:31] Baptists become Methodists and the
[29:33] Pentecostal wants to take all the
[29:35] Methodists and make them Pentecostals.
[29:37] It's a change of thought.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; But that's not what we're talking about.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; We're talking about God, the creator.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; And I said, surely the creator would
[29:53] speak and I wouldn't have said that if
[29:55] that vision hadn't been there by no
[29:57] means. Now I said, "Now if the one that
[30:00] let him be God, come give him his
[30:02] sight." Now I said, "Now I challenge any
[30:05] priest or Rachel or holy man or any what
[30:09] it might be, come give him his sight and
[30:12] I'll follow your philosophy. You've made
[30:14] a convert." That the quietest bunch of
[30:17] people I ever heard.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Nobody did it. I said, "What you so
[30:22] quiet about?" I said, "The reason you
[30:25] are is because you can't do it." and
[30:27] neither can I. But the God of heaven who
[30:30] raised up his son Jesus Christ whose
[30:33] servant we are has just showed me a
[30:36] vision that the man's going to receive
[30:38] his sight.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; I said now if that be not so then you
[30:46] could order me out of India. But if it
[30:48] is so every one of you owe your life to
[30:51] Jesus Christ. I would like to ask you,
[30:53] how many in here will give your life to
[30:55] Christ if this blind man receives his
[30:58] sight? You see your priest? Nobody comes
[31:01] up here. Why don't they come? If they've
[31:04] told you the religion is so big and so
[31:06] great,
[31:08] &gt;&gt; why don't somebody come and say
[31:09] something? Nobody come. I said, then you
[31:13] people out there, if you see this blind
[31:15] man standing here and I've come a doctor
[31:18] to examine his eyes, he shook his head.
[31:20] He said, "He's blind." And so I said,
[31:23] "Certainly, he's blind." But I said, "If
[31:26] if God gives him his sight, how many of
[31:28] you will serve Jesus Christ and just as
[31:30] far as I could see of oceans of black
[31:32] hands turned to the man and said, "Lord
[31:36] Jesus, let it be known that thou art
[31:38] God." The man grabbed me around the neck
[31:39] and there set the mayor of Bombay
[31:41] sitting there. Grabbed him around next
[31:42] to see as good as anybody could. What is
[31:45] it? It's uh it's actually a power.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; God is God.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; And Satan is Satan.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe in a devil, when I
[32:00] first got started, I I run headlong into
[32:03] him every day. Don't tell me there's no
[32:05] devil because I know better.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; I have to fight with him every day.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; So, I know there is a devil
[32:15] &gt;&gt; and you must be trained. What do you
[32:18] believe? Amen.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Not trained in psychology, not trained
[32:22] in education,
[32:24] &gt;&gt; but trained by the Holy Spirit.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; God's power in his word to make it
[32:31] manifest.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Know your enemy. Oh, what a cruel thing
[32:37] he is. How I would like to stand here
[32:40] now and lay on to that. Go back to the
[32:44] Bible. Show your man back there who come
[32:48] face to face with how in the contest
[32:52] against the enemy they fortified
[32:55] themselves by the word of God. Noah had
[32:59] an experience of it.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; And he knew that God told him was going
[33:03] to rain. And the contest was on between
[33:08] science and the word of God. Science
[33:10] says it can't happen. And God said it
[33:12] will happen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; That same thing exists today.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; It will happen.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; It does happen.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; There is devils.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; But Jesus cast them out.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; And he gave his church authority to do
[33:34] so.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Cast out devils in my name. He cast
[33:39] seven devils out of a pretty woman one
[33:41] day.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "When the unclean spirit is
[33:47] gone out of a man, he walks in dry
[33:49] places, returning back then, bringing
[33:52] seven other devils with him."
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Now, that goes to show that if the man
[33:57] was cleaned of devils, there was
[34:00] something was in him that had gone out.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; A devil had gone out.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. out. When the devil moved
[34:08] out, that God gives God an opportunity
[34:11] to move in.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; So, and when he goes out, let the Holy
[34:18] Spirit come in. Don't just leave it
[34:20] there. If you do, just repent of your
[34:24] sins and go on.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Then you're going to be worse off than
[34:27] ever.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; But get that place where Satan once
[34:33] lived and occupied. Get it filled with
[34:35] the Holy Spirit of God and then you'll
[34:39] have the strength of God's word in you
[34:42] manifested and
[34:44] &gt;&gt; cast out devils.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Contest is on.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; The evening lights are shining.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; God's Holy Spirit is present.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now it's just about
[34:58] about 3 minutes until the time that the
[35:02] whistles are going to be blowing and it
[35:06] will be midnight. And then as we leave
[35:08] this building to go to our different
[35:11] places and our homes and to meet outside
[35:18] &gt;&gt; and to meet the world.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Let's not go as we have in former times.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go in the power of his
[35:27] resurrection. Let's go in the name of
[35:30] Jesus Christ with the banner lifted high
[35:34] and with faith in his word, the handle
[35:38] the two sword
[35:40] with the shield and the full armor of
[35:42] God on to beat the enemy because he's
[35:46] getting stronger and more powerful every
[35:49] day. As a as the enemy comes in like a
[35:54] flood, the spirit of God raises up a
[35:57] standard against him.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; If we have come to the end of these
[36:02] things that we and the mysteries of God
[36:05] has been completed with us, we are
[36:07] looking for more strength, a rapture
[36:10] strength to be a diverse force that'll
[36:13] rapture the church and take it in the
[36:15] glory.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must have it.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Let's meet 63 with a challenge.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; We are the servants of the living God.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; I'm like Shadrach, Mach, and Abednego of
[36:33] all will not bow to the devils
[36:36] &gt;&gt; of this world.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And take back this thing that what we've
[36:40] talked about. But let's press the
[36:42] battle.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] feel tonight as we're listening for them
[36:47] whistles. Something like David did that
[36:49] dreadful hot night when he laid out
[36:52] there under them malberry bushes and the
[36:54] enemies a routing.
[36:56] What an hour it must have been for
[36:58] David. What a time for him laying there.
[37:01] He didn't know how to move. He didn't
[37:03] know what to go by because he knowed he
[37:07] was outnumbered. But all at once he
[37:10] heard the sound of a wind going through
[37:13] the top of the bushes. He knowed God
[37:15] went on before him
[37:17] &gt;&gt; and he went to the battle.
[37:20] I feel something like that tonight after
[37:23] last night's message.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; I'm laying in the darkest hour that I
[37:27] ever faced in my life.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I feel like Isaiah at the temple after
[37:32] seeing those angels. I'm a man of
[37:34] unclean lips and dwelling among people
[37:37] with unclean lips.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I've got to meet it somewhere.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; And the only thing I'm waiting to hear
[37:47] that rushing through the malberry bushes
[37:50] &gt;&gt; to go to meet the enemy wherever it is.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; God help us to do it.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now I think it's 1 minute
[37:58] until 12:00 and uh 62 with all of its uh
[38:04] pass. Let's let it be passed. Let us
[38:07] stand to our feet now. Hallelujah. Each
[38:09] and every one of us
[38:11] &gt;&gt; the context is on.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Each one of you. Paul said, "Forgetting
[38:21] those things that are in the past,
[38:25] &gt;&gt; the all our mistakes of last year, I
[38:28] press towards the mark of the high
[38:30] calling."
[38:32] &gt;&gt; All my mistakes that I made in all these
[38:34] years, forgive me for them.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; God, forgive me. Church, forgive me. And
[38:39] the ministry that I I fail with, I feel
[38:43] God, forgive me for it, church, forgive
[38:45] me my mistakes. Now press towards the
[38:48] mark of the high calling in Christ
[38:50] Jesus. Whatever tomorrow holds, I don't
[38:53] know, but I know who holds. 1963.
[38:56] Let us raise our hands to God now. And
[38:59] let us pray in our own way as we make
[39:01] our confessions and ask God to help us
[39:05] through this next coming year.
[39:08] Heavenly Father, as we stand here, as
[39:12] many thoughts is dying out in our hearts
[39:17] and of the mistakes of last year and as
[39:20] we are approaching the death of 62 and
[39:25] the birth of 63.
[39:27] Oh God, may we be one step higher up the
[39:32] ladder until we can see Jesus and his
[39:36] program.
[39:38] May everyone here, Lord, in prayer while
[39:41] the old year's dying and the new birth
[39:44] of the new year is coming in. May the
[39:48] old man's sin and unbelief die out in
[39:52] our hearts and the new birth come in
[39:54] with the 1963
[39:56] like a Russian mighty wind that might
[39:59] fill our bees and make us new creatures
[40:02] in Christ. Make us fit servants. Forgive
[40:06] our past. Bless our future. Guide us, oh
[40:10] Lord God, with thy mighty hand, Jehovah.
[40:13] Bless these ministers here. Bless all
[40:16] the leoty, all the visitors. Be thou
[40:19] with us, Lord. We are your servants and
[40:22] we give ourselves holy to you for 1963
[40:27] that the power of your spirit might have
[40:30] more primaces.
[40:48] Good morning. God bless you all. That
[40:50] was a mighty wonderful preaching there.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; I was enjoying it so much. Praise the
[40:56] Lord. All righty.
[41:00] Get this going.
[41:03] God, that's good. Let's bow our heads
[41:05] and um and pray. Dear heavenly father,
[41:07] we're so grateful, Lord, to be alive one
[41:10] more day, to be um
[41:13] to have God's revelation this day, to
[41:15] have your rest, your priest, to have
[41:17] your presence with us, Lord. We're so
[41:19] grateful, Lord, that we can call upon
[41:20] your name. We're so grateful that we can
[41:22] come with anticipation and believe for
[41:24] all things and that we can, Father God,
[41:27] uh, still receive revelation of your
[41:28] word that we can know that we're called
[41:30] in this last age, Father, as your bride,
[41:32] Father, to accomplish your will on this
[41:33] earth, Father, and to believe your word
[41:36] and to rest in your word, to let rest in
[41:39] your promises.
[41:40] And then we're so thankful we have thus
[41:42] say the Lord that we have a sure word of
[41:43] promise and that we have Father such a
[41:46] sure sound of trumpet that we have just
[41:48] such a sure word of prophecy that we
[41:50] have such a a true message this age
[41:53] father that you brought through your
[41:54] prophet prophet. Father we believe it
[41:56] and we just ask u that you enlighten to
[41:58] us this day or your precious words and
[42:01] that you would teach us father more in
[42:03] the revelation of your truth and in your
[42:04] message in the name of Jesus Christ our
[42:07] Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:18] God is good.
[42:23] Praise the Lord. So today I'm on topic
[42:25] of u God's presence. God's presence and
[42:29] I think it'd be uh
[42:31] wonderful to uh to share the scriptures
[42:34] here. I've been God has shown me and
[42:37] it's um it's just a beautiful topic to
[42:39] me. Um I was going to teach on the topic
[42:42] of of believe and um just surely last
[42:46] night the Lord um guided me to to this
[42:48] precious topic. It's I think it's so
[42:50] beautiful right
[42:52] God's God's presence in his presence. So
[42:55] his presence is an expression of his
[42:57] attributes. It we're talking about the
[42:59] sa selfsame presence of the divine being
[43:02] of God. Think about it like when you
[43:04] have a little child or someone come
[43:06] nearest to you and and you just you're
[43:08] in that presence of someone. They're
[43:10] you're perceiving you're expressing that
[43:12] the the attributes the August presence
[43:14] the warmth and and the comfort that
[43:18] comes with being personally with
[43:20] someone.
[43:21] And in Psalm 16:11,
[43:25] I love I love that it says, "Thou wilt
[43:28] show me something that gets
[43:30] demonstrated, revealed that the paths of
[43:32] life, the path of life in thy presence
[43:36] is fullness of joy." That's a joy that
[43:38] is complete, that is full.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; God's joy. At thy right hand there are
[43:43] pleasures forever more. And I think it's
[43:47] special that we have a God that just
[43:48] doesn't just give a word, doesn't just
[43:50] give a manual and instructions, but he
[43:52] actually comes and indwells the person.
[43:54] He comes and he carries out the the same
[43:57] power, the same um his his being, his
[44:00] presence, right?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the for his
[44:03] comforter. And in first uh Chronicles
[44:06] 16:27, it actually gives four precious
[44:09] words here uh associating with God's
[44:11] presence. So it's talking about his
[44:14] presence. Glory and honor are in his
[44:17] presence. Strength and gladness are in
[44:21] his place.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; I think about just
[44:26] I I had a little struggle yesterday and
[44:29] all I did is just I yielded to the Lord
[44:32] and affliction, a pain and and just
[44:35] instantly um God's presence came by
[44:38] &gt;&gt; and it it just changes everything. It
[44:41] does give you a strength. It does put a
[44:42] gladness in you and and you experience
[44:45] God's honor and glory, something that's
[44:48] divine and something that no medicine
[44:50] can do in you.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; And to me, it's precious, right? When
[44:53] you're spiritually delivered from your
[44:54] afflictions, when his presence comes, uh
[44:57] fullness of joy comes healing and it
[45:00] brings about the restitution, the
[45:01] restoration of what we need. I think
[45:03] first as as a spirit being, you know,
[45:07] and we're going to do a study uh and get
[45:10] to the good part of his presence, but I
[45:11] just want to touch upon what it is to be
[45:13] away for his pre presence a bit about
[45:16] the also how his enemies, you know,
[45:19] tremble at his presence and are melt at
[45:21] his presence and what that does and also
[45:24] how there's a there's really a reverence
[45:26] and a respect, a trembless and people
[45:28] that are troubled at his presence that
[45:30] comes by and then there's an approach to
[45:32] his presence, you know, and then by
[45:34] God's grace, we have been able to
[45:35] experience the the goodness of his pre
[45:37] presence.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; So, you know, it does it doesn't come by
[45:40] just like that. Of course, there's an
[45:42] approach. And we see in Genesis 3:8 when
[45:45] it first talks about the presence
[45:47] or God's presence and and in this case,
[45:50] and they heard the voice of the Lord and
[45:54] of God walking in the garness in in the
[45:56] gu garden in the cool of the day. And
[45:59] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[46:01] the presence of the Lord.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; See, amongst the tree of the garden. So
[46:07] see, his presence is something to to be
[46:09] sought out for, but it is also something
[46:11] to that kind that can come with the
[46:13] tremble, with the with the with the
[46:15] fear.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So in Genesis 4:16, we also see Cain
[46:18] went out of the presence of the Lord and
[46:21] dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of
[46:24] Eden. So see, he's went out of the
[46:27] presence. It's interesting to know that
[46:29] at some point he he was actually in or
[46:31] about or around his presence,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Because he went out of the presence of
[46:35] the Lord.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; The Lord spoke to him at some point too,
[46:39] right?
[46:40] [clears throat]
[46:41] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham speaks in 62 in the
[46:43] message in his presence. It says, "May
[46:46] the Lord bless his word." I think that's
[46:49] the most striking scripture we find that
[46:52] in the presence of God, men recognize
[46:54] themselves to be sinners.
[46:56] See, it's a it's a miracle for us to be
[46:58] able to even uh recognize. I remember
[47:00] when when um I actually for the first
[47:03] time, it kind of sounds like an
[47:05] oxymoron, but believe that I was a
[47:07] sinner, you know, because I was a sinner
[47:09] back then, living in sin. And I remember
[47:13] I had an uncle of mine who would testify
[47:14] and said, you know, um you're living in
[47:17] sin and all that. And and after a while,
[47:20] you know, you the first things you say
[47:22] is like, I'm not a bad person. I don't
[47:23] go robbing banks. I don't go doing that.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how people say the same
[47:27] thing. And I said that I said that
[47:30] right. I justified myself. So I didn't
[47:32] believe I was a sinner. But when I first
[47:35] believed that I was a sinner or or or
[47:38] knew or recognized like it says
[47:40] recognize that you're a sinner, that's a
[47:42] miracle.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And I think that's when you're God's
[47:45] getting closer to you. You're getting
[47:46] closer to the Lord because that's got to
[47:48] come with his presence. It's got to be a
[47:50] miracle.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; We pray that over our children, right?
[47:52] of our youth that um when they're gone
[47:54] astray that may may God's presence go
[47:57] start working on them and then just
[47:58] bring that conviction
[48:00] &gt;&gt; that's we may feel pretty good when
[48:02] we're um out different places and feel
[48:05] like that we're pretty good people but
[48:07] whenever come into the presence of God
[48:11] then we see how little we are
[48:13] &gt;&gt; then we recognize right that we're
[48:15] sinners so enemies do perish at his
[48:17] presence we know um when mine enemies
[48:20] are turned back, they shall fall and
[48:23] perish at thy presence. So picture this.
[48:25] It says, "As smoke is driven away, so
[48:28] drive them away. As wax melteth before
[48:31] the fire,
[48:34] they [clears throat] have no they stand
[48:34] no chance, right? Wax stands no chance
[48:36] before the fire. So let the wicked
[48:39] perish at the presence of God,
[48:42] &gt;&gt; you know, and that that's also your your
[48:43] enemies, your foes, you know, the the
[48:45] bad influences, the spirits that battle
[48:47] us." And I just think that God does that
[48:49] sometimes. He does that um to and I'm
[48:53] thankful that he does, right? Because
[48:55] our enemies are are are not flesh and
[48:57] blood. They're spirituals and
[48:59] principalities.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that he can do
[49:02] that to our enemies. In Isaiah 64, it
[49:05] says, "As when the melting fire burneth,
[49:07] the fire causes the waters to boil to
[49:11] make thy name known to thy adversaries."
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Makes the name known to them. Can you
[49:17] imagine just them devils and then all of
[49:19] a sudden says I am the Lord Jesus
[49:21] Christ.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; They must flee.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Says that the nations may tremble at thy
[49:26] presence. Tremble at this presence. So
[49:29] in here we have this is a pretty
[49:31] interesting question the Lord poses in
[49:32] Jeremiah 5 as a prophecy. He says fear
[49:35] ye not me
[49:37] say the Lord.
[49:39] Will you not tremble at my presence
[49:43] which have placed the sand for the bound
[49:46] of the sea
[49:48] by [music] perpetual decree that cannot
[49:51] pass it? You know the the waves cannot
[49:54] actually go over that. And though the
[49:56] waves thereof to toss themselves, they
[50:00] yet they cannot prevail. Can they not
[50:03] prevail? Though they roar, they cannot
[50:08] they can. It says yet they yet can they
[50:10] not pass over it. So I just think the
[50:13] Lord um the Lord's presence is something
[50:15] to be uh you know reverence about
[50:17] because it it's a itself being coming
[50:20] near and manifesting. I I think Job u
[50:23] describes it here well. This is Job
[50:25] speaking for he perforth the the thing
[50:28] that is appointed for me and many such
[50:31] things are with [clears throat] him. It
[50:34] says therefore I am troubled at his
[50:36] presence.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Right? See, when there's affliction,
[50:39] when there's such, you know, we we
[50:40] recognize when I consider, I'm afraid of
[50:43] him, for God maketh mine heart soft
[50:48] &gt;&gt; and the Almighty troubleth me.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; So, see, take don't take for granted,
[50:54] you know, now that you're a mature
[50:55] Christian and you can come into God's
[50:56] presence. You know, it came because of
[50:58] all of this.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; It came because of the Job experience.
[51:01] It came because, you know, his presence
[51:03] allowed us to recognize that we were
[51:04] sinners. It came with that with with
[51:07] that growth and that progression and his
[51:10] self same presence is him right but the
[51:12] same God will come and separate divide
[51:14] and cause these uh these things to be
[51:17] moved away from our lives you know these
[51:19] costs of battle you know cause the
[51:20] nations to tremble against you know the
[51:22] God of Israel and such the God of Jacob
[51:24] it says in the Bible as well but for you
[51:26] they know it starts then to realize you
[51:28] know but this is who I am think about
[51:31] like God coming in the presence and
[51:33] defending a little child of in front of
[51:34] a bully or something or big brother and
[51:36] you know he basically first comes and
[51:38] and he you know he strikes fear at the
[51:41] and mel like fire burns away you know at
[51:43] his presence and then the little boy
[51:45] goes like now he's afraid of the one
[51:48] that defended him and he basically says
[51:50] like I didn't know you can do that and
[51:53] then now he you know after your heart is
[51:55] soft and and you're troubled at him then
[51:57] then you're in a position to come
[51:59] approach his presence right in respect
[52:01] and reverence
[52:02] &gt;&gt; and then you can experience his sweet
[52:04] fellowship, his august presence, his
[52:06] comfort, all the the good the good
[52:08] benefits of his presence
[52:10] &gt;&gt; that come with the selfexisting one.
[52:12] Right? Psalm 68:8, the earth shook, the
[52:15] heavens also dropped at the presence of
[52:17] God. Even Si itself was moved at the
[52:20] presence of God, at the God of Israel.
[52:23] So this is in the natural, right?
[52:24] Tremble thou earth at the presence of
[52:26] the Lord, at the presence of the God of
[52:28] Jacob. See that no flesh should glory in
[52:32] his presence. Right.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; I I I can attest to that, right? It's
[52:35] not our flesh, of course, but that glory
[52:37] is in his presence. But boy, our soul,
[52:39] you know, that's been redeemed,
[52:40] regenerated from God. It does. It did
[52:42] say that his presence comes with a glory
[52:44] and an honor and strength and gladness
[52:47] and say uh I like this little section
[52:49] here about just one verse about so
[52:52] fleeing from the presence of a foolish
[52:54] man. So see the fresh the foolish man
[52:56] can also comes with the presence and it
[52:57] says go from the presence of the foolish
[53:00] man when thou perceiveth not in his lips
[53:06] um of it says when thou perceiveth not
[53:08] in his the lips of knowledge
[53:11] &gt;&gt; so that he there's no knowledge as in
[53:12] his le lips the presence of god brings a
[53:16] conviction so that's that's uh one of
[53:18] the message quotes I have here is in his
[53:19] presence the same message in 62 but the
[53:21] random says then we realize how little
[53:23] we are when we realize how great he is
[53:26] and how close we come in of his of
[53:29] coming to his presence. Somehow or
[53:31] another, it's always throwed a great
[53:34] effect upon people to come into the
[53:36] presence of God. I've seen the time in
[53:39] my ministry when you would see the
[53:42] presence of God come into such a place
[53:45] that it would bring a person up and just
[53:48] reveal the life to them,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; right? and call out their sins of all
[53:53] kinds of immoral acts. And it brings
[53:55] such a holy hush
[53:58] amongst the people till they drop out of
[54:00] the prayer line. Look at this
[54:03] illustration. Before they ever come out
[54:05] to be prayed for and run to the altar
[54:07] and get right with God before they come
[54:12] unto his presence.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? God's presence was
[54:15] so perfectly there
[54:19] &gt;&gt; next to the prophet when he was um in
[54:22] the uh discernment that the people just
[54:26] feared at his presence. You know, as
[54:28] they came close in the prayer line, can
[54:29] you picture that? They would just go to
[54:30] the they would just go to the altar and
[54:32] make it right first.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Before they came in any much closer to
[54:36] that presence. See, there's something
[54:39] about coming into the presence of God.
[54:40] It causes things to happen. Yes.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; You know, either to the enemy or to the
[54:44] devils or, you know, to ourselves the
[54:46] believer as as we surrender to his
[54:48] presence.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; In Psalm 140 and 13, it says, "Surely
[54:51] the righteous shall give thanks unto thy
[54:54] name, the upright," so it's not talking
[54:55] about the believer, right? "Shall dwell
[54:57] in his presence." I love that word dwell
[55:00] because that word dwell is is it's um
[55:04] it's like uh such a a um trusting word
[55:08] where you can be with someone but dwell
[55:11] means like you're sitting back taking
[55:13] off your shoes like in your house in
[55:15] your living room
[55:17] &gt;&gt; and and you're dwelling and when you're
[55:20] you're just at ease you're you're you're
[55:22] comforting and trusting the in whose
[55:24] presence you're in. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; I love dwelling. You know, I love like a
[55:28] dwelling your home, right? It's it's
[55:30] it's a dwelling and and that is how we
[55:33] should abide dwell in in God's presence.
[55:36] And this is the verse that we read uh
[55:38] just just a reminder, glory, honor in
[55:40] his are in his presence. Strength and
[55:43] gladness are in his place. Another of
[55:46] the opening scriptures. So, thou shalt
[55:48] show me. And we'll find here with Mary
[55:50] is that when the angel of the Lord um
[55:52] came, he says from the presence of God,
[55:54] he says, "And I will show you things." I
[55:57] just love the revelation of God because
[55:58] it says here, "Thou will show me the
[56:00] path of life."
[56:01] &gt;&gt; He shows us the way that we should go
[56:03] where the life is in. In thy presence is
[56:05] fullness of joy. At thy right hand there
[56:08] are pleasures forever more.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; In [clears throat] this Psalm 17, it
[56:11] says, "Let my sentence or my vindication
[56:14] come from thy presence. Let thine eyes
[56:18] behold the things that are equal.
[56:22] Whether shall I go from thy from thy
[56:24] spirit or whether shall I flee from thy
[56:26] presence? You know, if I go here, you're
[56:28] there. If you go up there, you're there.
[56:31] I just think that once you've been
[56:32] impregnated, right? Once you've been um
[56:34] entrusted with God's presence and and
[56:36] experience God's presence,
[56:39] I believe it we're in there for the long
[56:41] haul because, you know, like I said,
[56:44] God's presence does bring a separation,
[56:45] a division or it does bring a a fight.
[56:47] It does bring a burning that melts the
[56:49] enemies away and it does bring a
[56:50] trembling. It does bring an approach.
[56:53] But, you know, once you go through all
[56:54] that, it does bring that that that rest
[56:56] and that peace.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; So, rest in his presence. Here I have.
[57:00] And he said, "My presence shall go with
[57:02] thee." This is to to Moses and I will
[57:04] give thee rest.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; So this a rest as a company as we talked
[57:08] about couple month a month ago on God's
[57:11] rest. So I just love that his presence
[57:14] comes with a rest. Something that you
[57:16] can again lay back, dwell, trust.
[57:20] See look I this verse is very dear
[57:23] because it says in Psalm 31:20, "Thou
[57:26] shalt hide them in the secret
[57:30] of thy presence."
[57:32] So, isn't that amazing? Is thy his
[57:34] presence being a secret place, right? In
[57:37] the secrets of thy presence from the
[57:39] pride of man, thou shalt keep them
[57:43] secretly in a pavilion from the strife
[57:47] of tongues. Isn't that a a a comfort
[57:51] comfortable place to be with to know
[57:53] that
[57:54] God hides them in the secret of his
[57:58] presence
[57:59] and from the pride of man and thou shalt
[58:02] keep them secretly in a pavilion from
[58:06] the strife of tongues. I say, you know,
[58:09] sometimes I don't take that for granted
[58:11] what it's like just to be um
[58:14] covered, to be shielded
[58:17] uh from uh from a strife of man, from
[58:19] the strife of tongues, from the pride of
[58:21] man. You know, it's
[58:25] don't take it for granted, right? All
[58:26] the things you're that you've been um
[58:29] protected from that you all the comforts
[58:32] in knowing his presence. Cast me not
[58:34] away. Since Psalm 51, you know, it's u
[58:36] created me a new heart, oh Lord. Cast me
[58:38] not away from thy presence and take not
[58:40] thy holy spirit from me.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; That's everybody's prayer here.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; The hills melted like wax at the
[58:48] presence of the Lord at the presence of
[58:50] the Lord of the whole earth. See, in all
[58:54] their affliction, he was afflicted. Look
[58:56] at this. And the angel of his presence
[58:59] saved them.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; In his love, in his pity, he redeemed
[59:05] them. Isaiah, and he bared them and
[59:08] carried them all the days of old.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; All the good things God's presence does
[59:14] for them.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Just try it one time. It's it's
[59:17] wonderful when you just surrender. And
[59:19] um it does take a it does take an
[59:22] effort, right? You have to go set aside
[59:24] and but boy, when you enter into God's
[59:27] presence through prayer,
[59:30] hearing the the preaching of his word,
[59:31] hearing the message,
[59:34] singing a song, Right?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hearing a song that's that's what it's
[59:39] about is just being in contact with your
[59:41] heavenly father.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; The burden of Egypt. See this is talking
[59:46] about the burden of Egypt.
[59:48] Behold the the Lord writeth upon a swift
[59:51] cloud. We have a message. And shall come
[59:54] into Egypt and the idols of Egypt shall
[59:57] be rem removed at his presence.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; This is what his presence does. And the
[1:00:01] heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst
[1:00:03] of it. I'm thankful that we have a word
[1:00:05] and a presence of God that the Lord can
[1:00:08] ride in a swift cloud and and that can
[1:00:10] melt away just move all the idols in our
[1:00:13] life
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and that he can um he can melt the the
[1:00:18] presence of with our heart the heart of
[1:00:20] Egypt the heart of the world right get
[1:00:22] is melted in the
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; in the the midst of it. Second
[1:00:26] Chronicles we have and all the kings of
[1:00:29] the earth sought [snorts]
[1:00:30] the the presence of Solomon. So this is
[1:00:33] the God's presence in a believer now in
[1:00:36] someone that who trusts in him to hear
[1:00:38] the wisdom that God had put in his
[1:00:42] heart.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; So remember we knew about God's wisdom.
[1:00:46] I mean Solomon's wisdom but God's
[1:00:49] presence was with them with him.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful that we have God's
[1:00:53] presence in us.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; And a greater than Solomon was here said
[1:00:57] Jesus. Isn't that amazing? So
[1:00:59] approaching his presence as we wrap up
[1:01:01] here in 2 Chronicles
[1:01:04] it it says and they dwelt therein and
[1:01:07] have built the sanctuary therein for thy
[1:01:09] name. So think about the word thy name
[1:01:12] saying if if when evil cometh. So this
[1:01:14] is the approach. If when evil cometh
[1:01:16] upon us as a sword or judgment or
[1:01:18] pestilence or famine or really bad
[1:01:20] things we stand before his this house
[1:01:24] and in thy presence. And it says, "For
[1:01:27] thy name is thy in thy house in thy
[1:01:30] presence and cry out unto thee in our
[1:01:34] affliction. Then thou will hear and
[1:01:37] help." Isn't that amazing? The approach
[1:01:39] is it's repentance. You know, it does
[1:01:41] come through through that approach. Let
[1:01:43] us come before his presence with
[1:01:44] thanksgiving and make a joyful noise
[1:01:47] unto him with psalms, with singing.
[1:01:50] Amen. Praise the Lord. Serve the Lord
[1:01:52] with gladness. come before his presence
[1:01:55] with singing. That's God's approach.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And and here's the account on Mary. And
[1:02:01] the angel answering said unto, excuse
[1:02:03] me, not Mary. And the angel answering
[1:02:05] said unto him, I am Gabriel that stand
[1:02:09] in the presence of God,
[1:02:11] and I'm sent to speak unto thee, and to
[1:02:14] show thee glad tidings.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is just amazing how there's
[1:02:20] there's an angel that stand in his
[1:02:21] presence. And what it does is it reveals
[1:02:23] as it show glad tidings in in Jude 24 uh
[1:02:28] to 25 we have now unto him this is the
[1:02:32] last scripture here. So unto him that is
[1:02:35] able to keep thee from falling.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Help us Lord. and to
[1:02:42] present you faultless before the
[1:02:44] presence of his glory with exceeding
[1:02:48] joy.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; To the only
[1:02:52] God our savior, he says, "To you only
[1:02:55] God our savior, be glory and majesty,
[1:02:58] dominion and power for now
[1:03:01] and ever." Amen. Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; And just as we wrap up here, God's
[1:03:06] presence um to the believer is something
[1:03:09] that it really comes with the with the
[1:03:11] goods. It comes with the it's where
[1:03:14] we're healed. It's where we're
[1:03:15] strengthened. It's where we're equipped.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; It's where we um God's word comes alive.
[1:03:21] It's when the uh you know, it's the it's
[1:03:24] the evidence that God is is near and
[1:03:26] with us, that he's he's still along the
[1:03:29] way encouraging us. And it's a
[1:03:31] visitation, right? It's a self it's self
[1:03:34] being ever present. And just to know
[1:03:37] that the God that created us all,
[1:03:39] created everything is is able to come
[1:03:42] and manifest in the believer
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; and is able to come. And I love the word
[1:03:47] August presence because
[1:03:50] in Spanish the word August means or a
[1:03:52] gusto. It means that you're very well
[1:03:55] comfortable. It actually means like
[1:03:57] you're comfortable, but you're like it's
[1:03:59] like expressing the the feeling that you
[1:04:02] get when you're comfortable. It's a it's
[1:04:03] like think about when you put that nice
[1:04:05] sweater or the nice coat on and it's
[1:04:06] just August. It's uh it's amazing how
[1:04:10] brother Bam taught a lot about the
[1:04:11] August presence of the Lord and just
[1:04:14] really um comforting his people, you
[1:04:17] know, and uh we go through a lot. So,
[1:04:19] I'm thankful that we have God's presence
[1:04:21] to u make all things right.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless you, brothers.
[1:04:26] Have a wonderful service. [applause]
[1:04:28] Praise the Lord.

[1:35:00] Fresh heavenly father, we thank you for
[1:35:02] this day and we ask you Lord to forgive
[1:35:04] us of our sins. Cleanse us, Lord, and
[1:35:06] have your way with us. Pour out that
[1:35:09] form and letter rain through us, Father,
[1:35:11] that we can manifest that which you have
[1:35:13] brought to us and laid on our table here
[1:35:15] at this end time, Father.
[1:35:18] And we ask, Father God, today that
[1:35:22] you just bless every ear that's here and
[1:35:25] every word that spoke come from you,
[1:35:27] Lord.
[1:35:28] And reveal it to us, Father. Open our
[1:35:31] eyes. Let us not be blinded by the
[1:35:34] things of the world or
[1:35:37] and Father, we ask now that you'd bless
[1:35:40] all of those that couldn't make it
[1:35:41] through the door today, Lord. Be with
[1:35:43] them and bless them, the ones at home,
[1:35:45] and bless our family members still out
[1:35:47] in the world, Father, cuz we know your
[1:35:50] word. Your word said we'd be here with
[1:35:51] our offspring. And we believe that,
[1:35:53] Lord, this time of season, we ask you
[1:35:55] just to bless each one in a special way.
[1:35:58] bless our pastor, Lord, as he's
[1:36:00] preparing to bring the your meal to us
[1:36:03] today that you've placed upon his heart.
[1:36:06] And you just be with him, Lord, and come
[1:36:07] down and use that vessel and bless him,
[1:36:10] Father, as he speaks to us. And we ask
[1:36:13] now, Lord Jesus, that
[1:36:16] you bless the reading of the word and
[1:36:19] have your way with us. And we ask these
[1:36:21] things in your name, Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:36:23] Amen.
[1:36:25] Amen. Amen. as we go to the word.
[1:36:30] Went the wrong way. Sorry.
[1:36:38] The old Bible don't have the names in it
[1:36:41] anymore. So, [snorts]
[1:36:43] here we go.
[1:36:45] [clears throat]
[1:36:47] John five, I mean James 5 1-12.
[1:36:51] Go to now ye rich men. Weep and howl for
[1:36:54] your miseries that shall come upon you.
[1:36:58] Miseries, I'm sorry.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Your gold and silver is cankered, and
[1:37:07] the rust of them shall be a witness
[1:37:10] against you, and shall eat your flesh as
[1:37:13] it were fire. Ye have heaped treasures
[1:37:16] together for the last days.
[1:37:35] Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth
[1:37:37] and been lon. Ye have nourished your
[1:37:40] hearts as in a day of slaughter.
[1:37:50] Be patient, therefore, brethren, until
[1:37:52] the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
[1:37:54] husband of man waiteth for the precious
[1:37:56] fruit of the earth, and hath long
[1:37:59] patience, for it until he receiveth the
[1:38:01] early and the latter reign.
[1:38:11] Grudge not one against another,
[1:38:13] brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold,
[1:38:16] the judge standeth before the door.
[1:38:20] [clears throat]
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Behold, we count them happy which
[1:38:32] endure.
[1:38:33] Ye have heard of the patience of Job and
[1:38:36] have seen the end of the Lord, that the
[1:38:39] Lord is very pitiful and of tender
[1:38:41] mercy.
[1:38:44] But of all things, my brethren, swear
[1:38:47] not, neither by heaven, neither by
[1:38:50] earth, neither by any other oath, but
[1:38:53] let your yay be yay, and your nay be
[1:38:56] nay, lest ye fall into condemnation.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the opening of the word.
[1:39:02] You may be seated.

[1:39:32] song this morning.

[1:39:54] precious memories and things [music] and

[1:40:06] wanted to hear wanted to sing [music] it
[1:40:08] this morning. It's called It Came Upon a
[1:40:10] Midnight Clear. That glorious song of
[1:40:13] old.

[1:40:35] a song [music] of old
[1:40:42] from angels
[1:40:45] bending
[1:40:47] near
[1:40:48] the earth to touch their [singing]
[1:40:53] hearts [music] of gold.
[1:40:59] Peace [music and singing] on

[1:41:06] to men
[1:41:08] from [music] heaven's
[1:41:10] all gracious
[1:41:13] king.
[1:41:17] The world
[1:41:19] in silence
[1:41:21] [singing and music] stillness
[1:41:24] lay to hear [singing and music] the
[1:41:28] angels
[1:41:30] sing.
[1:41:32] [music]
[1:41:34] Still [singing] through the glowing
[1:41:39] skies
[1:41:40] they come
[1:41:42] with [singing] peaceful [music]
[1:41:45] wings
[1:41:47] unfur.
[1:41:49] [music]
[1:41:51] And still
[1:41:53] their heavenly
[1:41:55] [music] music
[1:41:58] flows
[1:41:59] for all [singing and music] the weary
[1:42:04] world.
[1:42:08] Above
[1:42:10] it [singing] sad
[1:42:12] and lonely [music]
[1:42:14] place
[1:42:16] they bend on our

[1:42:29] babble
[1:42:31] sounds
[1:42:33] the blessed
[1:42:35] angels [music]
[1:42:38] sing.
[1:42:41] And ye [music]
[1:42:43] beneath
[1:42:45] life's crushing
[1:42:48] blow
[1:42:49] whose faults [music]
[1:42:52] are
[1:42:54] low.
[1:42:58] to
[1:43:00] along
[1:43:02] the blinding [music and singing]
[1:43:04] way
[1:43:06] with painful
[1:43:08] steps
[1:43:10] [music] and slow.
[1:43:14] Look now for glad
[1:43:18] and golden
[1:43:20] eyes
[1:43:22] come swiftly
[1:43:25] on the way.
[1:43:30] Oh, rest [music] beside
[1:43:34] [singing] the weary
[1:43:37] robe [music]
[1:43:39] and hear [singing] the angels
[1:43:43] sing.
[1:43:47] For low the days
[1:43:51] I'm facing
[1:43:53] home,
[1:43:55] my [music]
[1:43:56] prophets
[1:43:58] sing
[1:43:59] of all. [music]
[1:44:03] And with the ever
[1:44:08] circleing
[1:44:10] years [music]
[1:44:11] shall come [singing] the time for told.
[1:44:20] And peace shout [singing]
[1:44:23] over all the earth it [music] is anient
[1:44:30] [singing] splenders
[1:44:32] fling. [music]

[1:44:40] back the song
[1:44:44] which now
[1:44:46] the angels
[1:44:48] sing.
[1:44:52] Yet with the [music and singing] woes
[1:44:56] of sin and strife, the world has
[1:45:03] suffered
[1:45:04] long.
[1:45:08] Many
[1:45:10] the angels
[1:45:12] strain have rolled to thousand
[1:45:18] [music and singing] years
[1:45:20] of Rome.
[1:45:24] and man
[1:45:26] at all.
[1:45:28] With man here's not the long
[1:45:35] which they bring.
[1:45:40] Oh, hush [music] the noise,
[1:45:44] ye man of [singing] strife,
[1:45:48] and hear the angels [music]
[1:45:53] sing.
[1:45:59] Amen. [applause and music]
[1:46:03] Amen.
[1:46:05] There was a night when there was angels,
[1:46:07] that heavenly host came with a message
[1:46:10] to speak to them peace.
[1:46:13] Thank God we had a message.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; We've had an angel visitation in our day
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; to bring a message of peace to us.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know that message is still
[1:46:23] going on today.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is stop and
[1:46:27] listen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; There's still an angel voice speaking.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring you great tidings of
[1:46:35] great joy
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; that you can receive a king also.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Not just one that came 2,000 years ago
[1:46:44] laid in a manger,
[1:46:47] but he comes to reside in you, take up
[1:46:50] residence inside you.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I'll lead you and guide you.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you,
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; even in you to the end of the world.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus wasn't born in
[1:47:08] December.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; But you know what? That message still
[1:47:11] applies today.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Every single day,
[1:47:16] we worship the God of heaven.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; He took on the form of sinful flesh
[1:47:24] that didn't know any sin
[1:47:27] that I could become what he is. Amen.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Today I'm the righteousness of God
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; because of his gift.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to proclaim that to
[1:47:50] the to the world
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; to show the world he still lives today.
[1:48:01] Praise God.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Like brother said, don't let ever this
[1:48:06] message ever get common to you.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:48:14] many years ago, the Lord come by my way.
[1:48:18] It spoke to me.
[1:48:21] He brought me out of the miry clay.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; He delivered me from the things of my
[1:48:28] past.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm sorry. I just
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; I think about that.
[1:48:44] [snorts]
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful gift.
[1:48:51] You know, we spend so much time talking
[1:48:52] about people buying gifts and
[1:48:54] everything. [snorts]

[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; And you want the world to see that Jesus

[1:54:00] sister testimony. Thank you, Lord.

[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[1:55:19] Hope we're all ready for a good service.
[1:55:23] It's been good so far. Um, I just wanted
[1:55:26] to piggyback on what brother Emanuel had
[1:55:30] read. [music] He read 1st Chronicles 16.
[1:55:32] You know, the glory and honor are in his
[1:55:35] presence. And R in the King James
[1:55:38] version in my Bible is italicized. So,
[1:55:40] it's put with emphasis. Strength and
[1:55:43] gladness are in his place. And if we
[1:55:45] skip down to verse 9, you see, give unto
[1:55:48] the Lord the glory that is due unto his
[1:55:50] name. Bring an offering and come before
[1:55:53] him. worship the Lord in the beauty of
[1:55:56] holiness. [music]
[1:55:57] So, we've come all with an offering of
[1:55:59] praise, I would hope. And
[1:56:04] my goodness, there's such a presence
[1:56:06] this morning. My hands are just shaking.
[1:56:08] All right.
[1:56:10] So, this is a a very well-known song.
[1:56:15] He [music] brought me out of the myy
[1:56:17] clay.
[1:56:18] So, I invite all of you to sing with me
[1:56:21] cuz we all know the song. You clap
[1:56:23] [music] your hands. You give him the
[1:56:25] praise. Okay.
[1:56:33] My heart was distressed
[1:56:35] [singing and music] Jehovah's
[1:56:37] found. And in the pit where my sin
[1:56:41] dragged me down, I cried to the Lord
[1:56:45] from the deep [music] f my clay. The
[1:56:49] tendency [singing] brought me out to
[1:56:51] golden day.
[1:56:54] He brought [singing] me out of the merry
[1:56:58] way.
[1:56:59] He set my feet on the rock to say
[1:57:04] he puts a song in my soul today. A song
[1:57:10] of praise. Hallelujah.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; He placed me upon the stone rock by his
[1:57:19] side. My steps were established.
[1:57:23] Here I abide. No danger of falling.
[1:57:28] While here I remain [music]
[1:57:30] but standing
[1:57:32] until the [singing] crowd I gain. He
[1:57:36] brought me out of the rain.
[1:57:41] He sets my feet on the rock to sing.
[1:57:46] He puts a song in [music and singing] my
[1:57:48] soul today. A song of praise.
[1:57:53] Hallelujah.
[1:57:56] He gave me a song was a new song of
[1:58:00] praise. By day by night,
[1:58:06] my heart's overflowing.
[1:58:09] I'm happy and free. I'll praise my
[1:58:13] redeemer who has rescued me. I'll sing
[1:58:17] of his [singing] wonderful
[1:58:20] to me. I'll sing.
[1:58:35] [music] I like this verse. I'll sing
[1:58:37] [singing] of his wonderful mercy to me.
[1:58:42] I'll praise him till all men his
[1:58:45] goodness [music and singing] shall see.
[1:58:47] I'll sing of salvation at home and
[1:58:51] abroad. Till many shall hear the truth
[1:58:55] and trusting God. He brought me out of
[1:59:00] the mighty pl.
[1:59:03] He sets [music] my feet on the rock till
[1:59:06] I say he puts a song in my soul today.

[1:59:32] today.

[2:00:13] soul today. A song of praise.
[2:00:17] Hallelujah.

[2:00:28] Hallelujah.
[2:00:34] Remember us today. Thank you. God bless
[2:00:37] y'all.

[2:07:37] child. Your cries

[2:07:53] all night
[2:07:56] because you've held on with all of your
[2:08:00] might. [singing]
[2:08:01] Child, your cries
[2:08:05] [music]
[2:08:05] have awoken.
[2:08:08] The master.
[2:08:13] Oh, he knows
[2:08:17] your voice.
[2:08:20] Lift your hands. It's time to rejoice.
[2:08:25] Child, you'll cry.
[2:08:29] I've awoken
[2:08:32] the master.
[2:08:39] Praise the Lord. [applause]
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to know one thing. If you
[2:08:43] don't realize you're standing in the
[2:08:45] presence of Almighty this morning,
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; I think you're dead.
[2:08:52] Praise God. I thank God he's there this
[2:08:54] morning.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Well, if you if you will indulge us this
[2:08:58] morning, we got one more song.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel has a special this
[2:09:03] morning. We're going to allow him to
[2:09:05] come and sing. bless us this morning.
[2:09:09] [applause]
[2:09:13] God bless you.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Sorry I get a little nervous. Um
[2:09:21] this song I'm about to sing this
[2:09:22] morning. Um
[2:09:24] once I finally gotten a grasp of on
[2:09:26] English, you know, with the vowels and
[2:09:28] all that consonants, uh this was the
[2:09:30] first song I had sang for the church and
[2:09:33] was able to really articulate myself.
[2:09:35] So, um I'm hoping that it reaches and
[2:09:37] touches y'all as it did me. Um growing
[2:09:40] up wasn't a very big kid. Strong, fast,
[2:09:44] yes. But the eye test I failed for a lot
[2:09:46] of people. So, you know, a lot of people
[2:09:49] thought they could come in, shake me up,
[2:09:51] you know, get in my mind, rattle me up,
[2:09:54] but I shall not be moved. Amen. So, I'm
[2:09:59] not sure what key really to call. So
[2:10:01] just go. [snorts]
[2:10:04] Jesus is my savior. I shall not be
[2:10:08] moved.
[2:10:10] In his love and favor, I shall not be
[2:10:14] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[2:10:17] by the water.

[2:14:55] [applause]
[2:14:56] Good job, man. Amen. One more time. Give
[2:15:00] him a big hand clap of prayer.
[2:15:03] [applause]

[2:15:52] to be here.
[2:15:55] Amen. [snorts]
[2:16:00] Amen.
[2:16:03] By way of a few announcements,
[2:16:05] remember there'll be no service this
[2:16:07] coming Wednesday be Christmas Eve and we
[2:16:09] will have uh uh no service then. Um
[2:16:14] happy holidays to all of you
[2:16:20] on and off.
[2:16:22] Um remember brother Chris Long will be
[2:16:25] here next Sunday.
[2:16:27] Um watch night service coming up. These
[2:16:31] are all the announcements next, not this
[2:16:33] coming Wednesday, next Wednesday at
[2:16:34] 8:00.
[2:16:36] Is it not switched?
[2:16:40] Um, I want to give you a report from
[2:16:41] Jamaica. U Keith Reed, I know y'all
[2:16:44] heard that Mon'nique had amp a she had
[2:16:47] her appendix taken out.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's what exactly what I said. She had
[2:16:51] her appendix taken out.
[2:16:54] So, she's doing good. And the Lord was
[2:16:56] good that she didn't have that attack in
[2:16:58] the air or have that attack somewhere
[2:17:00] else. she was at home with mommy and
[2:17:01] daddy. So we uh uh we thank the Lord for
[2:17:05] that. But we have sent
[2:17:09] um according to reports
[2:17:13] um now this is accumulative of four
[2:17:16] churches
[2:17:17] uh brother Thomas Ber um brother Dut
[2:17:21] Scott, brother Isaac Negron and this
[2:17:25] church have sent approximately $26,000
[2:17:29] to Jamaica. Amen. [applause]
[2:17:36] And brother Keith sent me a report that
[2:17:38] they have bought the material
[2:17:41] for the two roofs to go to Northampton
[2:17:44] and to go on Ginger Hill. And that's
[2:17:48] about $14,000.
[2:17:50] So they've got that started. They've got
[2:17:53] the wood bought. Uh they still need to
[2:17:56] buy, I think, the uh the roofing
[2:17:58] material for for one more church. Excuse
[2:18:01] me.
[2:18:02] But that's $26,000
[2:18:04] that the four churches have sent over
[2:18:06] there besides what brother Joe Green got
[2:18:09] and besides what other people have sent
[2:18:11] them, but we wanted to make sure to send
[2:18:14] it to Brother Keith so that the
[2:18:16] believers could have a um um you know
[2:18:19] benefit from it. Okay. Now, we did send
[2:18:22] a bunch of clothes and all that that
[2:18:23] y'all sent and put downstairs. We give
[2:18:26] it to brother Aaron and he took it to
[2:18:28] where he works and it's a division of
[2:18:30] Toyota and Toyota put it on a big boat
[2:18:34] and shipped it over there. But now that
[2:18:35] won't go to all the believers. That'll
[2:18:38] go to the whole people in the islands
[2:18:40] cuz we believe in helping humanity. We
[2:18:42] believe in helping our family first.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; But we believe that there is people
[2:18:47] there that were suffering that needed
[2:18:49] these things. So we we sent that out to
[2:18:51] them. So we sure do appreciate all of
[2:18:53] you for all the stuff you brought
[2:18:55] together. the funds and the food and the
[2:18:57] different things for us to send over
[2:18:58] there. And they said, "Thank you so very
[2:19:01] much." So, I'll give you another report
[2:19:03] when they finish or when they get almost
[2:19:06] finished with those two churches. Now, I
[2:19:08] don't know about the um uh the brother
[2:19:10] that lost his home there at Ginger Hill.
[2:19:13] I'll have to call and ask about that,
[2:19:16] but we pretty much the funds that we
[2:19:17] sent is probably going to be able to
[2:19:19] take care of most of that. The $26,000
[2:19:22] from just us are going to take care of
[2:19:24] that. So, it wasn't just from the
[2:19:25] church. It was the four churches. Uh,
[2:19:28] Brother Brad uh Powell from Brother
[2:19:30] Ber's church jumped on the bandwagon and
[2:19:33] they um took up money and took up money
[2:19:37] twice actually. And then Brother Dutch
[2:19:39] Scott wanted to put some money in
[2:19:40] brother Isaac Negron. So, they sent it
[2:19:43] to us and we sent it through um Wells
[2:19:46] Fargo because we're that's our account
[2:19:49] Wells Fargo and we were able to send it
[2:19:51] instantly to brother Keith. Only cost
[2:19:52] like $25, right Jim?
[2:19:54] to send the money over there. So, we did
[2:19:57] that. Got that sent over there and and
[2:19:59] we'll get a report from them and if they
[2:20:01] need any more, we'll talk about it later
[2:20:02] later. But, but as of right now, I think
[2:20:05] that's enough for them to get started
[2:20:06] with. And like I say again, appreciate
[2:20:08] all of you having a part in it. So, and
[2:20:12] we sure appreciate all the gifts and the
[2:20:15] and the stuff that the last couple weeks
[2:20:17] and thank you so very much. And we
[2:20:19] appreciate the gift of eternal life more
[2:20:21] than anything. Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've um I've been asked by two
[2:20:27] separate people about having Bible study
[2:20:30] again. So, I want to kind of put it
[2:20:33] before you this coming year. Uh maybe
[2:20:36] having it like once every two months. U
[2:20:39] we'll talk about it. Maybe we'll discuss
[2:20:40] it in January once all the holidays are
[2:20:42] over and brother Joe and him's going to
[2:20:44] be gone. Luis and them's going to be
[2:20:46] gone and [sighs] our line's gone and
[2:20:49] different ones are going to be gone uh
[2:20:50] during the holidays and that's fine. Go
[2:20:53] visit your family and uh come back to
[2:20:56] your church family.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz this is the one we're going to
[2:21:00] live eternity with. The other one we'll
[2:21:02] see. We'll claim them all. We don't
[2:21:05] throw any of them out. We going to claim
[2:21:06] them all. So I was telling brother Boyd,
[2:21:08] I said, "Brother Keith3 told me one
[2:21:10] time, he said, "Brother Wade, that's the
[2:21:11] white throne judgment." He said, "We
[2:21:13] will have more power."
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; We will have more power than the
[2:21:20] prevailing power that was in this Bible
[2:21:22] that said they got to believe in the
[2:21:23] Lord Jesus Christ. Because you
[2:21:24] understand one thing, somebody that
[2:21:26] never knew God ever, never knew about
[2:21:28] Jesus Christ, if they did something good
[2:21:30] for you through you, you would impart
[2:21:33] the eternal life to them.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how powerful your eternal
[2:21:37] life is. And you know what? That eternal
[2:21:38] life is going to carry you all the way
[2:21:40] to the white throne. Not to be in
[2:21:42] judgment,
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; but to be a judge.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; And you know what? If you judge
[2:21:46] righteous,
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; somebody's been good to you, your
[2:21:48] family's been good to you, your mama,
[2:21:50] your daddy, anybody that's not a
[2:21:51] believer, claim them.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Claim them even at the white throne
[2:21:55] judge. Why not?
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for big things.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where we're going to have the
[2:22:02] most prevailing power. We will have
[2:22:05] eternal life. We'll be eternal people.
[2:22:06] and we'll have the mind of God.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; So, we'll not do anything that he didn't
[2:22:10] think we did. We're going to do before
[2:22:11] the foundation of the world. But he
[2:22:13] wants to do what? He wants to do it
[2:22:15] through us.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Okay? If not, then we can just go home
[2:22:18] and sit down and just close our eyes and
[2:22:20] let God talk to us in our brain. Well,
[2:22:22] guess what? Most of the time, that ain't
[2:22:23] God that talks to me like that.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Well, hello, somebody.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, pray for me and and brother
[2:22:30] Gay because he's he's admitting the same
[2:22:32] thing. So, just pray for us that the
[2:22:34] devil won't be playing in our head
[2:22:35] anymore.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; But back then, ne then we'll have the
[2:22:40] mind of Christ.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; We won't have to worry about that guy.
[2:22:42] He's gone. He's in the He's in this He's
[2:22:44] in that sea.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Of of of We ain't going to never
[2:22:50] remember that guy no more.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; The former things will pass away.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Behold, what?
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; All things will be made new.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We're uh uh good to have
[2:23:00] you again. We're going to stay on the
[2:23:02] Son of Man. We're going to try to get
[2:23:03] through some of this uh through Matthew
[2:23:05] 24. And uh now listen,
[2:23:10] there's only one man on earth that ever
[2:23:15] understood
[2:23:17] really who the devil was and where he
[2:23:20] was.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; All right? And that's the son of man.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; He sat there and he told them, they
[2:23:28] said, "Is it me? Is it me? Is it me? Is
[2:23:30] it me at the at the supper? Is it me? Is
[2:23:32] it me? And he said, "Whoever sops the
[2:23:34] bowl," well here goes Judas the bowl and
[2:23:37] nobody knew a thing.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; cuz he was the son of man.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; So keep that in the back of your mind.
[2:23:46] The son of man is the only only form of
[2:23:50] God
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; that can tell where the devil's at.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody else is deceived
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; except the group that's going to take
[2:24:00] the body change and get out of here in a
[2:24:03] rapture. All right. So, I just believe
[2:24:05] we're part of that. I believe that we
[2:24:07] are in the right message.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; I don't mean this building, but we're in
[2:24:11] the right building. We're in the right
[2:24:13] tabernacle. We're in the right mode of
[2:24:16] transportation. We're in the right way.
[2:24:19] We got to get oursel out of the way, but
[2:24:20] we got to get in the way that that that
[2:24:22] God sent us a prophet to go down that
[2:24:24] path. And that's what I believe that
[2:24:26] these seals are for. They're not just to
[2:24:29] expose the Antichrist, but they're to
[2:24:30] reveal Jesus Christ and where he's at.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; He's in his people. Amen. So, let's bow
[2:24:35] our heads to heavenly father. Lord,
[2:24:37] thank you for this day. Thank you for
[2:24:38] all the songs and the worship, Lord.
[2:24:40] Now, we're going to worship you, Lord,
[2:24:41] in in speaking of the gospel. Father, I
[2:24:44] pray that you'd be with each one. Lord,
[2:24:46] bless the ears to hear, Lord, and the
[2:24:48] hearts to receive today, Lord, what you
[2:24:50] have for them. Father, forgive us of our
[2:24:52] sins and mistakes. Lord, bless the ones
[2:24:54] that are sick, that are not here.
[2:24:55] Brother Joe and them that are traveling,
[2:24:56] Brother Luis and them getting ready to
[2:24:57] travel. Sister Regina already where
[2:24:59] she's at, Lord. The ones that are
[2:25:01] traveling, if we miss anybody, Lord,
[2:25:03] just protect each one. Father, this time
[2:25:06] of Christmas time, Lord, is a time that
[2:25:08] that we need to uh reflect on you more
[2:25:11] and know that it's not you that was born
[2:25:13] in a manger on December 25th. That it
[2:25:16] was we know it was in April, but Lord,
[2:25:19] we know that we had a birth.
[2:25:22] That was the manger of our heart that
[2:25:24] you were birthed when we were lost in
[2:25:27] sin and didn't know anything. We were
[2:25:29] out in the world running around.
[2:25:31] Father, you come to us and said, "Be
[2:25:34] mine. I want you to be mine." And we
[2:25:38] accepted him in our heart. And we thank
[2:25:41] you for that, Lord. That we accepted
[2:25:42] you, Lord. Now, Lord, I pray that you
[2:25:44] accept us. Accept the gifts that we give
[2:25:46] you, Lord. The things that we have
[2:25:48] today, Lord, to give back to you,
[2:25:50] Father, which is listening and hearing
[2:25:52] the word of God. Lord, just bless each
[2:25:54] one, Father. Be with the bride around
[2:25:56] the world. be with the ones in the
[2:25:57] foreign fields like brother Keith and
[2:25:59] different ones as they navigate through
[2:26:01] all that time of of turmoil and things
[2:26:04] in this country. Lord, I pray that you'd
[2:26:05] be with each bride over there and all
[2:26:07] the humanity, Lord, that you'll be with
[2:26:10] them, Father. And may they see Jesus
[2:26:11] Christ in all these things. We ask you
[2:26:14] in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:26:18] 1 Corinthians 2:9, but as it is written,
[2:26:20] I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[2:26:23] have entered into the heart of man the
[2:26:25] things which God hath prepared. Now
[2:26:27] watch, for them that love him. So that
[2:26:29] puts it in a different category.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; All right. I like I like Paul. He He
[2:26:34] brings you He brings you a dissertation
[2:26:36] and he says, "This is why."
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; So we're going to get the things that
[2:26:40] God has prepared prepared for us if we
[2:26:42] love him.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; They're prepared for everybody. But you
[2:26:46] and I have got to be the one to accept
[2:26:48] it.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed him unto who? Us
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; by his spirit. For the spirit searches
[2:26:54] all things, yay, the deep things of God.
[2:26:57] And that's the um in one of the um
[2:27:00] versions of the Bible says, even the
[2:27:02] inmost depths of God's being. And that's
[2:27:04] what we're here for.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; We're here to learn more of God.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his being and his substance
[2:27:10] and what he is and and how that he's
[2:27:12] been hid from everything else and and
[2:27:14] without a revelation he's hid from us.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can be seated and I'll
[2:27:18] continue reading though. Let me read
[2:27:19] this for brother Brandham
[2:27:22] trying to do God a service in 1965. Now,
[2:27:24] we're we're getting ready to start on
[2:27:26] the seals. Uh like I said before, we've
[2:27:28] kind of piecing this thing together
[2:27:30] because of people being out. And uh
[2:27:33] we're going to be out in January. Um a
[2:27:37] couple of days, Brother Richard Wilson
[2:27:38] is he just about pretty much lassoed me
[2:27:41] to come preach for him. So I'm going to
[2:27:43] do that on January the 11th and then on
[2:27:46] the 4th I'll be gone to hunting in Ohio.
[2:27:48] But we'll be back and then we'll get
[2:27:50] started end of January, 1 of February
[2:27:52] straight through every service will be
[2:27:54] we'll talk about the seals. Okay, there
[2:27:57] by way. Now, without the opening of the
[2:27:59] seals, we will not take a body change.
[2:28:01] Without the opening of the seals,
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; will not get the fullness. And that
[2:28:05] don't mean you're not a Christian.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to don't don't think
[2:28:09] that that because you don't understand
[2:28:10] fully everything that you're that you're
[2:28:12] not a Christian. No, the devil's telling
[2:28:14] you that, but we're not telling you
[2:28:16] that.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; But to live a full Christian life, he
[2:28:18] wants us to be what? A stature of a
[2:28:21] perfect man. He wants us to be
[2:28:24] Christians to where if you can't find
[2:28:27] me, you can find him.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; He's the one you need to talk to anyway.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; All right. As we were talking last
[2:28:34] Sunday or before, I said I, you know, I
[2:28:37] being a pastor, that's it's been
[2:28:39] different the past year or so. But I
[2:28:41] found out one thing. You're never going
[2:28:44] to make it by a human mortal man. That's
[2:28:46] right.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; It's got to take the leadership of the
[2:28:49] Holy Spirit
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; through a group of men by the five-fold
[2:28:53] ministry that's going to bring you to
[2:28:55] perfection. You just every once in a
[2:28:58] while, um, Brother Gabe, you need a a
[2:29:01] shepherd
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; with a shepherd hook
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; or or break your leg every once in a
[2:29:06] while to keep you in the fold. But it's
[2:29:08] God that's going to do the revealing.
[2:29:10] It's God that's going to do all the
[2:29:12] work. All right? And we appreciate all
[2:29:14] of you and we thank you so very much. I
[2:29:17] the devil just beat me up the other day
[2:29:18] because I said I didn't want to be your
[2:29:20] pastor. That's not exactly true. I
[2:29:22] didn't want to be I didn't say I want
[2:29:24] this job.
[2:29:26] Okay. I didn't I didn't hand out flyers
[2:29:29] and posters and you know I've been
[2:29:31] through that voting thing, you know, so
[2:29:32] I won't be and I won't be the mayor
[2:29:34] after a few weeks. So I didn't become
[2:29:36] I'm not a mayor anymore. So, um um that
[2:29:40] that was just something that I did to
[2:29:41] help the community and I believe I did
[2:29:43] help the community and the community got
[2:29:45] better for it and now I hand it over to
[2:29:47] somebody else cuz I got a bigger job to
[2:29:49] do.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um but you know there is going
[2:29:53] to be government in heaven.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; The government shall be on his shoulder.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; There will be kings and priests. And
[2:30:02] brother Bram said, if you got kings, you
[2:30:04] got to have something to rule over.
[2:30:06] Right.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; All right. So, not with a rod of iron.
[2:30:08] That's down here.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; But we do like he he he leads us with
[2:30:13] what? Nail scarred hands. He leads us by
[2:30:16] example number one and by what? Grace
[2:30:18] number two.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to read this
[2:30:21] in just a minute because when we get to
[2:30:23] the headstone, there's only one thing
[2:30:25] Brother Ram talks about the headstone.
[2:30:26] And he talks about it being Jesus
[2:30:28] Christ, being the son of man. But he
[2:30:30] takes you back to the scripture in in
[2:30:32] Jeremiah, I believe it is, that says
[2:30:34] that the headstone will come crying
[2:30:36] grace, grace unto it. Okay?
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; So that's the headstone. The headstone
[2:30:40] is Jesus Christ. The headstone today
[2:30:42] when we're going to read this scripture
[2:30:43] in Matthew 24, that was the headstone.
[2:30:48] Now, what do you mean by headstone?
[2:30:50] Headstone is the head man. It's the when
[2:30:52] you have an arch that comes up like this
[2:30:54] in a doorway, right here in the middle
[2:30:56] of that arch is a stone. If you've
[2:30:59] walked through some stone archways,
[2:31:01] there's one big one in the middle. That
[2:31:03] one is if you pull that one out, it all
[2:31:06] collapses.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; So that head stone has to be there. We
[2:31:09] ain't talking about headstones in a
[2:31:10] grave.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We put them on there.
[2:31:14] It's symbolic that there is a head.
[2:31:16] There is a head of of the whole human
[2:31:18] race. But we have a headstone that's not
[2:31:21] out in the grave.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; He's what? In the pillar of our heart.
[2:31:25] He's in the arch of our heart.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have him as the
[2:31:29] headstone, then we're going to crumble
[2:31:30] and fall.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; All right. So, just remember that.
[2:31:34] That's why in a nutshell, that's why the
[2:31:37] son of man ministry had to come back in
[2:31:41] the end time
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; cuz it's the headstone to the church.
[2:31:45] It's the head man, which was the son of
[2:31:48] man
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; back in power again in his people.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; What? Doing the same things he did when
[2:31:58] he was on earth.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Which is preach a perfect message,
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; To an imperfect people.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Who took my water?
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; I did. I said it right here before
[2:32:11] church started.
[2:32:14] Somebody drank my drink. Somebody drink
[2:32:16] my water. Aaron, did you drink my water?
[2:32:18] No, I said it right here. It was about
[2:32:20] half full. Well, who? Enjoy it. Bless
[2:32:22] you. [laughter]
[2:32:30] Be like a priest looking for holy water.
[2:32:31] Somebody done stole everything. I bet Lu
[2:32:35] has got it back there. He don't have the
[2:32:36] door open.
[2:32:39] But that's why. No. Oh,
[2:32:42] who got it?
[2:32:44] Don't point. Everybody's pointing at
[2:32:46] everybody else. Brother Manuel, you got
[2:32:47] my water, didn't you?
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; You don't know if it's yours.
[2:32:52] [laughter]
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; No, brother Manuel got it. Did you drink
[2:32:54] it? You'll be blessed all day.
[2:32:58] [clears throat]
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; I brushed my teeth three days ago. So,
[2:33:02] we're good.
[2:33:04] We're just family here.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. Just family here. But the reason
[2:33:09] the son of man, if he's standing on
[2:33:11] earth telling us this, that's why I was
[2:33:13] thinking the other day, why did Jesus
[2:33:15] stand on earth and preach the seals?
[2:33:17] Why? Because I'm going to tell you
[2:33:19] something. Nobody understood what he was
[2:33:21] saying.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[2:33:26] And then when brother Brandham gets here
[2:33:28] and he starts preaching on the seals,
[2:33:29] what'd he say? You ain't getting it. It
[2:33:31] ain't for you. This is not for you right
[2:33:34] now. You know, go and live a simple
[2:33:36] life. Jesus tells them that when they're
[2:33:38] when we're washing feet, what does Jesus
[2:33:39] say? He said, "You don't know what I'm
[2:33:41] doing, but you will know hereafter."
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz on the day of Pentecost, the
[2:33:45] hereafter came.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; They understood that. Peter was like,
[2:33:50] "You ain't washing nothing of mine."
[2:33:52] Jesus said, "You I don't wash your feet.
[2:33:53] You ain't part of me."
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; So Peter was like, "Wash me all, Lord."
[2:33:59] Jesus said, "No, I ain't got to do all
[2:34:00] that. I'm going to wash you within on
[2:34:03] the day of Pentecost and then you're
[2:34:05] going to help others get washed. But I
[2:34:07] want you to wash your feet as a symbol
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; of humility.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; We should be the humblest people on the
[2:34:15] face of the earth. If Jesus Christ, God
[2:34:17] Almighty in human flesh, the man that
[2:34:19] created the water, created the bowl, and
[2:34:21] created your feet, if you can't wash
[2:34:23] somebody else's feet, you're not going
[2:34:25] to heaven.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, get don't get quiet on me.
[2:34:30] Because in other words, what the problem
[2:34:32] is now is I see is not receiving
[2:34:36] headship.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; Headstone
[2:34:41] headship.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I told you many times. A lot
[2:34:46] of people want Jesus.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; They want Jesus to come into their life,
[2:34:50] but they want him to be Lord Jesus
[2:34:52] Christ. Do they want the Lord to take
[2:34:56] over?
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus was just a man. Come on,
[2:34:59] somebody. He was just a man walking on
[2:35:01] the face of the earth and he was in a
[2:35:03] body that was dying.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; Now, are they looking at that man? Are
[2:35:07] they looking at the man that was inside
[2:35:08] of him?
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Because that man is inside of him in you
[2:35:11] and I now.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; And then what that makes him? That makes
[2:35:14] him the Lord of your life.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; So that's why we baptize in the name of
[2:35:19] the Lord. We we identify that he is the
[2:35:22] Lord of our life.
[2:35:24] So let us make it a a New Year's
[2:35:27] resolution that for him to be more of
[2:35:29] the Lord of our life,
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; not to be someone that sits in the
[2:35:35] background. We want him in the
[2:35:36] forefront.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. So brother Bam, he comes up
[2:35:42] and this is in 1965. So what is he
[2:35:45] telling the people? He said, "The
[2:35:47] mysteries will be revealed in the last
[2:35:48] day." Now what did he always say? He
[2:35:50] said, "We are prophetic people with
[2:35:52] prophetic insight. We love revelation.
[2:35:55] We love the deep things of God." And and
[2:35:58] and don't get me wrong, I love
[2:36:00] everything's got to start with a
[2:36:01] foundation. Even when we get to
[2:36:03] Zerubable, he put a foundation. There
[2:36:06] was a foundation there for him to build
[2:36:09] on.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; So, we got to have the foundation, which
[2:36:12] is the sure cornerstone.
[2:36:14] Jesus was the cornerstone of the church.
[2:36:17] But remember, he's got to be the
[2:36:19] headstone of your life.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Because the cornerstone is right down
[2:36:23] here, but he wants to be up there.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; It's the same symbol. It's just up
[2:36:28] higher.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; And that's the headstone.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; So the headstone of the church is the
[2:36:33] son of man ministry.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; All right. So if we got to understand
[2:36:38] that to go further, then we got to
[2:36:40] understand who the son of man is.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Because they ask that question. Who is
[2:36:44] this son of man?
[2:36:46] But now remember, brother Brandham had a
[2:36:48] message to bring and it was in a
[2:36:50] two-fold manner.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; All right? He said in the church age
[2:36:55] book, we've read it. Dad read it a
[2:36:56] million times. So have I this message of
[2:36:59] Malachi 4 is going to do two things.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; One, he's going to restore the gifts
[2:37:04] back. He's going to restore us back to
[2:37:06] the upper room experience.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; Peter, James, and all those. Okay,
[2:37:11] that's the faith of the fathers. Now
[2:37:13] remember though, restoring back to the
[2:37:15] faith of the fathers will not take you
[2:37:18] in a body change
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; because it did if it would have it would
[2:37:21] have done them already.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; So remember that was lost. Remember even
[2:37:26] the Bible says the name of the Lord was
[2:37:28] lost during the ages. Why? They started
[2:37:30] baptizing the name of father, son, holy
[2:37:31] ghost. They totally lost the name.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; But they baptized in the name over here
[2:37:35] in the first church age, second church
[2:37:37] age, part of the third church age.
[2:37:38] Everybody with me? So now you got to
[2:37:40] have the alpha bride. The omega bride's
[2:37:42] got to be just like the alpha bride.
[2:37:44] Plus,
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; this plus was, listen, don't get me
[2:37:48] wrong. This plus over here was another
[2:37:50] church age.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; Another move of God, another act of God.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; Now, over here where we at in the
[2:37:58] seventh church age, there is no eighth
[2:37:59] church age.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; There's no ninth church age. So, this is
[2:38:02] it. Right?
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; So everything's got to be wrapped up in
[2:38:07] this message in this day in the time
[2:38:11] recognizing your day
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; today
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; and his message. So look, not when he
[2:38:18] starts out doing this what prayer lines.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; That was not his message. That was
[2:38:26] restoring the faith back for so people
[2:38:29] could have faith in this man called
[2:38:32] William Brham.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; But now remember that faith
[2:38:37] was superficial to some,
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Because once he started preaching the
[2:38:42] true message and he started preaching
[2:38:44] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[2:38:46] Jesus Christ and he started preaching no
[2:38:47] eternal hell. When he started preaching
[2:38:49] all these different things, what
[2:38:51] happened? Did those people come with
[2:38:52] him? No.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; They went gone. They gone bye-bye.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; So the real message then
[2:39:01] is not going to be a public show. It's
[2:39:04] not going to be to to um I won't call
[2:39:07] his name, but the guy that's got 600
[2:39:09] 800,000 people. No, I'm not talking
[2:39:11] about in the message. I'm talking about
[2:39:12] out in the world. You know, 10,000
[2:39:14] people in a man's church said he don't
[2:39:16] preach in sin. Well, maybe that's why
[2:39:17] he's got 10,000 people in his church.
[2:39:19] He's got 10,000 sinners.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; I believe I will.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm telling you, if you don't preach
[2:39:28] against sin, why is what are we doing
[2:39:29] here? Amen.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; And I ain't talking about that. And
[2:39:33] brother Bram said, "Now, now sin ain't
[2:39:35] smoking, drinking, gambling, and
[2:39:37] cussing."
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's unbelief.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; It's not believing that what God said."
[2:39:43] That's why Brother Ram said, "We sin
[2:39:44] every day." Why do we sin every day? You
[2:39:46] say, "I don't cuss, drink, smoke." No,
[2:39:48] you sin because you don't believe
[2:39:50] certain things.
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; Pray for me then.
[2:39:58] There's certain times that I don't
[2:39:59] believe certain things.
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; You do, too.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; But I know one thing's for sure. It's
[2:40:10] like brother Ram said, if you'll lay in
[2:40:11] the presence of the sun long enough,
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; you will ripen.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; You will become what God said you would
[2:40:19] become.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; And if he said it before the foundation
[2:40:22] of the world, like I said many times
[2:40:23] before, don't ever say, "God don't love
[2:40:25] me. All right.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; He can't change his mind.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; If he ever loved you one speck of a
[2:40:32] second before the foundation of the
[2:40:33] world, he can never change his mind.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Now, there's ups and downs and ins and
[2:40:37] outs and family and friends and all that
[2:40:40] that we got that we have problems with,
[2:40:42] but God is never going to change his
[2:40:44] mind.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; You will be a child of God if you were a
[2:40:50] child of God before the if he thought of
[2:40:51] you before the foundation of the world.
[2:40:53] That's the seed. The seed is what was in
[2:40:55] God's mind?
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; Because remember, when it was in God's
[2:41:00] mind, it was eternal.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; When man started coming down here and
[2:41:05] adding natural seed, you understand what
[2:41:07] I'm talking about? Adam and Eve and
[2:41:09] different ones. That's when he got a
[2:41:10] problem.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; We got to go back to that. You must be
[2:41:14] born again
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; and have the mind of Christ. Let him
[2:41:19] birth you in the manger as the song says
[2:41:21] the manger of your heart.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; So now brother Ram says look not when he
[2:41:26] starts doing this but when he begins to
[2:41:29] sound his message not the years of
[2:41:31] preparation in other words not the
[2:41:32] prayer lines.
[2:41:34] Now I want to get something really
[2:41:36] clear. There's groups in the message
[2:41:38] that believe that what brother Ram said
[2:41:40] from from 47 to 63.
[2:41:44] You don't have to believe all of it
[2:41:46] because he said things wrong. We just
[2:41:49] got to believe what he said from 63 to
[2:41:51] 65. Well, I'm like my dad always said,
[2:41:54] if you don't believe and and listen to
[2:41:57] 47 to 63, that's your foundation.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; You can forget about 63 to 65. Amen.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; Your foundation is, like I said before,
[2:42:07] it's getting those little things down.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; The details.
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; When you start building a house, what's
[2:42:17] the most important thing? Your
[2:42:19] foundation.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; You can build the prettiest Tajma Hall
[2:42:23] in the world and three or four years
[2:42:25] later, you'll get cracks in your wall.
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; You'll get your house leaning over. Why?
[2:42:29] Your foundation is not sure. We need as
[2:42:32] the Bible says a sure foundation
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; which is Jesus Christ. If we keep
[2:42:36] looking to him
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; then we'll be fine.
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; Then the building will stand on its own.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; But brother Brown said not the years in
[2:42:45] preparation but when he begins to sound
[2:42:48] the message then these mysteries then
[2:42:52] will be revealed. And brother Ram said
[2:42:55] and here they are not knowing them and
[2:42:57] you people are a witness of that. He
[2:42:59] told them right where it was at
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; that the headstone message was being
[2:43:03] preached. Now, this is 1965. He'd
[2:43:06] already preached the seals, but he's get
[2:43:07] coming down to the end of his ministry.
[2:43:09] And he's telling the people, "This is
[2:43:11] what you're This is why I came for
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; this is it. This is my ministry right
[2:43:16] here. This is what the seventh angel
[2:43:18] messenger has come to bring. He to
[2:43:20] restore and then
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; then to reveal the seals, to reveal the
[2:43:26] thunders that are contained in the
[2:43:27] seals.
[2:43:30] And what are the thunders? It's a
[2:43:33] revelation. When the seal breaks,
[2:43:34] there's a thunder.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; I'll read you. Well, don't worry now.
[2:43:39] Luke 17:30 says, "Even thus shall it be
[2:43:41] in the day when the son of man
[2:43:44] is revealed."
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; Not when he shows up, brother Joe. Not
[2:43:49] when he shows up, when he's revealed.
[2:43:53] It took us from 1963
[2:43:55] to 202 almost six
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; to get the revelation.
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're still here.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; So, we're still God's still revealing
[2:44:06] himself, trying to get us to see that he
[2:44:09] did come in 63 in the word.
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; But just as they rejected him the first
[2:44:16] time, they've rejected him again.
[2:44:20] Remember,
[2:44:28] Judas hung around long enough
[2:44:31] to get holy and sanctified.
[2:44:35] [snorts]
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; But like I said before, 11 other people
[2:44:38] in that room did not think Judas was the
[2:44:41] one. Right?
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to go, "Yo, you know, oh,
[2:44:45] well, Jesus told him go do what he's
[2:44:47] going to do."
[2:44:49] Well, he was telling him exactly who was
[2:44:51] going to betray him, but they're like,
[2:44:53] "Well, he's going to go and buy some
[2:44:54] more food or he's going to go pay for
[2:44:55] this food that we ate." They had no no
[2:44:57] clue. But the son of man is the only one
[2:44:59] that can tell what that other spirit is
[2:45:01] like.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; Without it will you will be deceived.
[2:45:06] [snorts]
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; So, here's the son of man. He's on
[2:45:09] earth. He's getting ready to preach a
[2:45:11] sermon and they don't understand any of
[2:45:13] it. But they asked him a couple
[2:45:14] questions. Jesus went out and departed
[2:45:16] from the temple. And his disciples came
[2:45:18] to him to show him the buildings of the
[2:45:19] temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See
[2:45:22] you not all these things? Verily I say
[2:45:24] unto you, there shall not be left one
[2:45:26] stone upon another that shall not be
[2:45:28] thrown down." Now, when was that? That
[2:45:30] was in AD70, when Titus destroyed the
[2:45:33] temple.
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; All right. And as he sat upon the Mount
[2:45:36] of Olives, the disciples came unto him
[2:45:38] privately, saying, Tell us, when shall
[2:45:40] these things be? What shall be the sign
[2:45:43] of your coming and of the end of the
[2:45:45] world? All right. So Jesus answered and
[2:45:47] said, now we're going to go start as
[2:45:48] brother Ram did in the uh sixth seal
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; and parallel the two because Jesus
[2:45:55] answered and said unto them, take heed
[2:45:57] that no man deceive you. Okay? For many
[2:46:00] shall come in my name, what? Jesus
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; or Christ.
[2:46:08] And shall deceive many. That's right.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Now, let's let brother Brandham explain
[2:46:14] that just for a second because what
[2:46:16] happened in the first seal you had a
[2:46:18] horse. I was listening yesterday to um
[2:46:21] No, it was coming back from Kentucky. 10
[2:46:23] virgins. On the 10 virgins, brother
[2:46:25] Brandham says that the white horse was
[2:46:27] the Holy Ghost riding through the church
[2:46:29] ages.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; But we know it was progressive
[2:46:35] revelation. We know that he we know that
[2:46:38] he's just a human being just like the
[2:46:40] rest of us. And listen, until God
[2:46:42] revealed, don't know, we don't need to
[2:46:43] say, "Well, I knew that when I first
[2:46:45] Well, bless God, pray for me." I didn't.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things I've had to
[2:46:49] learn over and over and over, Brother
[2:46:51] Kylie, over and over again.
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Stay here long enough
[2:46:58] and you'll get it.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Stay here long enough and you'll get it.
[2:47:03] Not I'm not I'm not talking about here.
[2:47:05] I'm talking about in the message.
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; Don't ever think when you walk through
[2:47:10] that door you got it made.
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; You might have a good seat sometimes
[2:47:16] or not. Have to sit somewhere else and
[2:47:18] have that look when you go by like
[2:47:20] they're sitting in my seat
[2:47:23] again.
[2:47:25] [snorts]
[2:47:28] So he
[2:47:29] brothers read a thought there but I'm
[2:47:32] not going to say anything. Revelation 6
[2:47:34] verse one. I'm just glad you're looking
[2:47:35] for a seat.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. And I saw the lamb when he had
[2:47:41] opened one of the seals. This is brother
[2:47:42] Brandham. He goes back to Revelation 6.
[2:47:45] And I heard it was a noise of thunder.
[2:47:47] One of the four beasts saying, "Come and
[2:47:49] see." Now, what beast was that? That was
[2:47:50] the lion. L I O N. The lion spirit of
[2:47:54] the four combat beasts said, "John, come
[2:47:57] and look and see. Something's fixing to
[2:47:59] happen." Right
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; now remember John was only commissioned
[2:48:02] to write what he saw
[2:48:06] not not reveal it write what he saw
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; right
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; okay
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; he because Jesus told him revelations
[2:48:12] one he said write these things and send
[2:48:14] them to the churches
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; so that's what John's job was to do so
[2:48:17] he saw these symbols he said behold a
[2:48:20] white horse he saw a white horse he that
[2:48:23] sat on him had a bow and a crown was
[2:48:24] given unto him and he went forth
[2:48:25] conquering
[2:48:27] and to conquer
[2:48:29] Now, this is what tore a lot of people
[2:48:31] up because brother Brandham said, "Oh,
[2:48:34] this fell is the antichrist,
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; right?"
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; Because a lot of people, a lot of
[2:48:38] commentaries said that was Jesus Christ.
[2:48:40] Even brother Random said mighty
[2:48:41] conqueror actually in 1957, he shows him
[2:48:44] riding through the church ages um
[2:48:46] shooting a bow of of love and had a
[2:48:48] crown on it, you know?
[2:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we needed a prophet. Amen.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; That's why we needed the son of man
[2:48:58] ministry to come in a cloud like he left
[2:49:01] in a cloud.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; The son of man left in a cloud.
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; He came back as the son of God in your
[2:49:08] soul as the new birth.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; But he's promised just like I read you
[2:49:13] in the days of what? The coming of the
[2:49:16] son of man, these things will be
[2:49:17] revealed. Well, where'd he come? He came
[2:49:19] in 1963. He didn't come physically. He
[2:49:22] will not come physically until the
[2:49:25] millennium. But he is physically in me
[2:49:27] and you.
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; That's why that there's more of us got
[2:49:31] to be out of here
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; that more of him can be in here.
[2:49:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's the whole walk of
[2:49:38] Christianity.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; It's not just coming and sitting in a
[2:49:41] church pew.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Become what you see.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; Become what you believe. Believe it and
[2:49:47] live it.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; But who do we find this per great person
[2:49:58] was? He's the antichrist.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; But remember, every clue [snorts] we
[2:50:03] needed was in the Bible when John
[2:50:07] saw it, wrote it down, scrolled it up,
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; put it in an earthn vessel, and they
[2:50:13] found it years later. That's right.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; And that was the apocalypse or the book
[2:50:18] of revelations.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; So John just wrote what he saw. He
[2:50:23] didn't make any commentary about it. He
[2:50:25] wrote what he saw. All right. And it was
[2:50:27] a wild horse. Well, you would think.
[2:50:29] Listen. But we got to remember we are we
[2:50:31] are dealing with the most deceiving
[2:50:33] person ever
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; to be on the earth or heaven or
[2:50:38] anywhere. Remember, he's originated in
[2:50:40] heaven.
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; He originated in heaven.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about the devil.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; And he fooled a bunch of angels to come
[2:50:48] down here and try to fool a bunch of us.
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; But what a fool he is.
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody is going to take this
[2:50:57] message and live it. And like brother
[2:50:58] Ram said, he said, "Satan will not know
[2:51:00] what to do with you."
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of people he knows how
[2:51:03] to handle. I'm preach somebody. He
[2:51:06] There's people that he knows how to
[2:51:08] handle. He knows how to manipulate every
[2:51:10] one of us.
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Bram said, "Satan's got
[2:51:15] one lick at you." He knows your weak
[2:51:17] spot. He said, "You better cover it up.
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; You better cover it up because that's
[2:51:22] the that's what Satan's going to start
[2:51:24] poking at."
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; And listen, everybody sitting in this
[2:51:27] room knows what your weakness is.
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know it. I don't want to know
[2:51:31] it.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; But you know what your weakness is
[2:51:34] because you live with you.
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; So you take that and work on it.
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; Work on it. work on keeping that thing
[2:51:42] covered.
[2:51:44] But he's the Antichrist. But Jesus never
[2:51:46] said he was the Antichrist. Jesus said
[2:51:49] what? Jesus said what? Take heed that no
[2:51:51] man deceive you. Well, this man did
[2:51:54] deceive the whole world except for those
[2:51:58] that are what? Marked with a mark or
[2:52:00] have the Holy Ghost.
[2:52:02] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:52:03] deceived. That's right.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; For many shall come in my name. In other
[2:52:07] What? In my name. Preaching
[2:52:10] saying, "I am Christ and shall deceive
[2:52:12] many."
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; See, there's your seal. It's the
[2:52:19] Antichrist. Remember, he had a bow with
[2:52:21] no arrows. He went forth conquering and
[2:52:23] to conquer. So, in the first couple of
[2:52:24] church ages, that's what that white
[2:52:26] righteous church did. Listen, Satan knew
[2:52:29] he couldn't get a true Christian
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; with, you know, bar hopping and
[2:52:36] come on.
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; He's in here today. He's not out there.
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; He's in here today and he brought his
[2:52:42] sleepy demons with most for some of
[2:52:44] y'all.
[2:52:47] That's kind of foolish to send a sleepy
[2:52:49] demon. I wish the demons would fall
[2:52:50] asleep. I'm not talking about none of
[2:52:52] y'all. [laughter] That's okay. Let me
[2:52:56] back up again. I just drank some water.
[2:52:59] [laughter]
[2:53:00] Think about that for a minute.
[2:53:03] I want the sleepy demons to fall asleep.
[2:53:05] Not anyway.
[2:53:08] But he's here and he knows how to
[2:53:10] deceive you.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; But there's going to come a time.
[2:53:15] Remember, there was one man he could
[2:53:18] never deceive.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; Who was that? The son of man.
[2:53:25] He was never deceived
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; ever. He knew everything that was going
[2:53:29] on.
[2:53:32] So if the Son of Man ministry is to do
[2:53:34] that, then the Son of Man ministry's got
[2:53:37] to do that here.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; Beware.
[2:53:42] Think about it. We come to a place and
[2:53:45] we look at this white righteous church.
[2:53:47] We look at this white horse and we look
[2:53:49] at this strong guy with a bow up. I
[2:53:51] mean, he's got that bow up like this and
[2:53:53] he's riding forth and he's conquering
[2:53:56] everything, you know, without even an
[2:53:58] error.
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; But he's what? He's conquering by
[2:54:01] deception.
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; He's deceiving the people into believing
[2:54:06] a lie.
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said the Bible said the
[2:54:09] lie,
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; which is the one Satan told Eve at the
[2:54:13] beginning.
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's Antichrist. And
[2:54:16] until you're born again, you are under
[2:54:18] that Antichrist anointing.
[2:54:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Sorry.
[2:54:23] &gt;&gt; Because all those all those without the
[2:54:26] Holy Ghost will be deceived. That's what
[2:54:27] the Bible says.
[2:54:28] &gt;&gt; All right. That's not an opinion of a
[2:54:30] preacher. That's the Bible.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:54:34] So, first 2 Thessalonians. And now we
[2:54:36] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[2:54:38] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[2:54:39] gathering together unto him, that you be
[2:54:42] not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
[2:54:45] neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by
[2:54:47] letter, as from us, as that the day of
[2:54:49] Christ is at hand.
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; Now, be careful. The day of Christ is at
[2:54:55] hand. You got to go back to Matthew 24
[2:54:57] and see that he said they would be false
[2:54:59] ones here.
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; So, you got to be careful. You got to
[2:55:02] keep them separate. All right? Keep them
[2:55:03] separate.
[2:55:05] All right. So, let no man deceive you by
[2:55:08] any means,
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; for that day shall not come except there
[2:55:12] come a falling away first. And we see
[2:55:14] that happening right now.
[2:55:16] &gt;&gt; We see that falling away happening.
[2:55:19] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[2:55:21] of predition who opposes and exalteth
[2:55:24] himself above all that is called God or
[2:55:27] that is worshiped so that he as God
[2:55:32] sitth in the temple of God showing
[2:55:35] himself that he is God
[2:55:37] &gt;&gt; that's pretty close
[2:55:40] remember you not that when I was with
[2:55:42] you I told you these things and now you
[2:55:45] know what withholding that he might be
[2:55:47] revealed in his time. What? When he
[2:55:50] wrote this back, whatever it was, he
[2:55:52] knew he wasn't going to be revealed
[2:55:53] then.
[2:55:55] &gt;&gt; All right. And now you know what
[2:55:56] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[2:55:59] his time. All right. For the mystery of
[2:56:01] iniquity doth already work, only he who
[2:56:05] now letth will let until he be taken out
[2:56:08] of the way. God letth will let until he
[2:56:11] the bride be taken out of the way.
[2:56:13] Brother Ram told us that. And then shall
[2:56:15] that wicked one be revealed whom the
[2:56:17] Lord shall consume with the brightness
[2:56:19] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[2:56:20] with the brightness of his coming. Even
[2:56:22] him whose coming is after the workings
[2:56:24] of Satan with all power look power signs
[2:56:29] and wonders
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; the devil
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; and with all deceivleness of
[2:56:36] unrighteousness and them that perish.
[2:56:40] Look, go back to what I said a minute
[2:56:42] ago. [snorts] God will reveal himself to
[2:56:44] those who what? Love him.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; Listen to this right here. Because they
[2:56:48] receive not the love of the truth. Some
[2:56:51] people can receive the truth,
[2:56:53] &gt;&gt; but they can't live it.
[2:56:56] &gt;&gt; They just can't live it. They can
[2:56:58] receive the truth. Well, listen. We've
[2:57:00] seen people be in the message 30, 40
[2:57:02] years. That's right.
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; They receive the truth,
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; but they didn't receive the love of it.
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the love of it
[2:57:09] will constrain you to be right here and
[2:57:12] not somewhere else.
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; And again, not I'm not saying this
[2:57:15] building. I'm talking about in this
[2:57:16] message, the truth of the hour and not
[2:57:19] out there saying that it's false and
[2:57:20] brother Brown was this and this and
[2:57:23] it's nothing but the devil.
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; It's that rider that's now on the pale
[2:57:28] horse. He's got all three powers working
[2:57:32] in him right now. Satan. But praise God,
[2:57:36] God's got all his power working in a
[2:57:38] bride.
[2:57:40] &gt;&gt; You know what? The devil might be
[2:57:42] looking for Jesus around here somewhere.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, I'm going to I'm just going
[2:57:48] to give you a little revelation here.
[2:57:50] If Brother Brandham asked when he went
[2:57:52] across the curtain of time, he said,
[2:57:54] "Can I see him?" Right? He was in the
[2:57:58] sixth dimension. Everybody with me? He
[2:57:59] was in the sixth dimension. He said,
[2:58:01] "Oh, good. Okay. I want to see him. What
[2:58:04] the angel say? He's higher. You can't
[2:58:07] see him right now. Well, he was in the
[2:58:09] seventh dimension.
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, there's two
[2:58:12] dimensions I know Satan can't get in.
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; Six and seven.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Six, we know he ain't there.
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; Seven is God Almighty himself.
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; So, I see. So, you're saying, "What' you
[2:58:25] say, brother?
[2:58:26] Satan is not understanding
[2:58:29] that even in that seventh dimension,
[2:58:32] he's in your dimension.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; He's inside of you sealed.
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; Remember, if you sealed, the devil don't
[2:58:40] know. And can't, Brother Brham said, if
[2:58:41] I say something, he said the devil can
[2:58:43] attack it.
[2:58:44] &gt;&gt; He said, but if I hold it in my heart,
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; come on. If I hold it in my heart, even
[2:58:51] the devil can't get in there. He can't
[2:58:54] understand that that love affair between
[2:58:56] you and you and God.
[2:58:59] &gt;&gt; When you go behind that tent and you go
[2:59:00] in there with God and he speaks to you
[2:59:02] and gives you revelation, Satan's
[2:59:04] nowhere to be found.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; He's gone off trying to deceive somebody
[2:59:09] else.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Bam said we come we
[2:59:12] try to come to a place to where Satan
[2:59:14] wouldn't know what to do with us.
[2:59:16] &gt;&gt; Well, he didn't know what to do with
[2:59:17] Jesus. He took him up on the mountain.
[2:59:18] He took him up on the he he took him in
[2:59:21] the temple. took him off and and all he
[2:59:23] said was scripture says
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; no scripture says that's all you got to
[2:59:30] do he did like brother said he didn't
[2:59:31] perform one miracle he just quoted him
[2:59:33] the scripture and walked off
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; right
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; and that's the same way with us
[2:59:38] and with all deceit of unrighteousness
[2:59:40] in them that perish because they
[2:59:41] received not the love of the truth that
[2:59:43] they might be saved and for this cause
[2:59:45] God now watch for this cause
[2:59:50] God sends them strong delusion
[2:59:54] &gt;&gt; that they should believe a lie.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; Believe a lie.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; That they all might be damned who
[3:00:03] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[3:00:06] in unrighteousness.
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; So that's a white horse. And then he
[3:00:11] gets off his white horse, he gets on a
[3:00:12] red horse. And then Jesus is standing
[3:00:15] there and he said, "Oh, you shall hear
[3:00:17] of wars." There's never been a war
[3:00:19] fought that there's not blood been shed
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; except the spiritual war and and that
[3:00:23] took bloodshed too.
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; And you shall hear wars and rumors of
[3:00:27] wars. Red horse, what? Red blood,
[3:00:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; See that you be not troubled, for all
[3:00:36] these things must come to pass. Now
[3:00:37] listen today, I'm telling you,
[3:00:39] everything that you've went through must
[3:00:41] come to pass for your perfection. If you
[3:00:44] will believe that instead of the oh wo
[3:00:46] is me, why is God pointing his finger at
[3:00:48] me? God might be pointing his finger at
[3:00:49] you, but what he's doing is he says,
[3:00:51] "Devil, go for him, but you're not going
[3:00:54] to get them."
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; What do you do with Job? He said, "Hey,
[3:00:58] come and look at Job." Job was sitting
[3:01:00] like we were talking about the other
[3:01:02] day, Brother Gabe. Job was sitting in
[3:01:04] his lounge chair that one of them
[3:01:06] vibrating recliners
[3:01:08] that's got heat. How do I know that?
[3:01:11] I've got a recliner that's never mind.
[3:01:14] [laughter]
[3:01:15] We have a massage chair.
[3:01:18] But here's Job and I mean he's like my
[3:01:21] 401k's got a couple million dollars in
[3:01:23] it and I got some man cows I can't
[3:01:26] count. Uh my kids are all going to
[3:01:29] church.
[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; They're all alive. They're all with me
[3:01:35] and I'm doing good.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden,
[3:01:41] all of a sudden though, all of a sudden,
[3:01:43] it wasn't that, come on. It wasn't that
[3:01:45] Job did something wrong,
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; but what it was was is God wanted to
[3:01:51] show. He had an eternal purpose.
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; He had an eternal purpose to let his son
[3:01:58] go through this. Come on, somebody. He
[3:02:01] let him go through that. Listen, if
[3:02:03] you've had a bad day, go read book of
[3:02:05] Job, first two chapters.
[3:02:07] Amen.
[3:02:09] &gt;&gt; He lost everything.
[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; Even his little comfy chair.
[3:02:14] &gt;&gt; It burned to the ground.
[3:02:17] &gt;&gt; He was sitting on an ash heap of his of
[3:02:19] his house,
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; scraping boils off of his
[3:02:24] body,
[3:02:26] &gt;&gt; and there was nobody left but his wife.
[3:02:28] And she was doubting him, too.
[3:02:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; So, Job was there all by himself.
[3:02:36] Why?
[3:02:38] Why
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; he did? No, he did. No, he did all the
[3:02:44] sacrifices. He did everything he was
[3:02:45] supposed to do. But God wanted to show,
[3:02:48] listen, show an eternal proof.
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:52] &gt;&gt; We'll talk. Hey, listen. We'll talk to
[3:02:54] Job, but we'll talk about Job for an
[3:02:57] eternity.
[3:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll meet the guy
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; and he'll tell us his experience,
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; And we'll like
[3:03:05] Job, through your adversity, there's no
[3:03:08] telling how many people.
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'm talking about us,
[3:03:11] too. There's no telling how many people
[3:03:13] were affected by that man going through
[3:03:16] one of the most horrible thing. He lost
[3:03:18] seven of his kids.
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; They died.
[3:03:22] &gt;&gt; He had seven, well, actually had 14
[3:03:23] funerals if they were married.
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; Cattle were gone. 401k was gone.
[3:03:32] any way to make an income's gone because
[3:03:34] his cows and chickens and all that's
[3:03:35] gone.
[3:03:37] &gt;&gt; So he's he's he's he's sitting in a in a
[3:03:40] depressed state.
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I know my redeemer
[3:03:44] liveth."
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; I know something's going to come out of
[3:03:48] this good.
[3:03:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of us when we're going
[3:03:51] through it, can we say the same thing?
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; No. We usually say, "What I do?" Well,
[3:03:59] maybe God wants to just use you as an
[3:04:02] example
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; to show someone someone else because
[3:04:05] remember the four the four um letters of
[3:04:08] testimony is
[3:04:11] t
[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; you got to go through a test
[3:04:15] &gt;&gt; to get a testimony.
[3:04:18] But listen, the Bible tells us the
[3:04:20] suffering of this world
[3:04:23] is not to be compared with the glory
[3:04:26] that shall be revealed in us at his
[3:04:29] coming.
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; We may look like horrible, destitute,
[3:04:33] don't know what we're doing, but you
[3:04:36] know what, brother
[3:04:38] and sister, that's God what he wants.
[3:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:41] &gt;&gt; He wants the cream of the crop,
[3:04:42] &gt;&gt; but the cream of the crop might not
[3:04:44] always look good
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; physically or emotionally. We may be a
[3:04:47] wreck, but God is going to do with his
[3:04:51] bride what he said he was going to do.
[3:04:53] He's going to perfect her here. We're
[3:04:55] going to be without Come on, somebody.
[3:04:57] We're going to be without spot or
[3:04:58] wrinkle here. We're not going to wait
[3:05:00] till we get there.
[3:05:02] &gt;&gt; We're heading toward it right now. When
[3:05:03] you have a body change, it'll be in this
[3:05:05] dimension.
[3:05:06] &gt;&gt; It will not be in a protected place.
[3:05:10] &gt;&gt; Those in the sixth dimension, it's just
[3:05:12] a protected, beautiful place. But
[3:05:15] remember, they're wanting to come here.
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; Why? I don't know. But I do know.
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they want to be
[3:05:25] humans again. [snorts]
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; It is in our DNA
[3:05:29] &gt;&gt; to be a human.
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; And we can't deny it.
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; In one more time. One more time. Are you
[3:05:36] ready?
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's DNA, God's DNA, he
[3:05:40] wanted to be a human. Right?
[3:05:42] &gt;&gt; He always wanted to be a human. You say,
[3:05:44] "Why?" Number one, God can't change his
[3:05:47] mind.
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; So, if he wanted to be a human, he's
[3:05:50] going to be one.
[3:05:52] &gt;&gt; If he's going to create the world, he
[3:05:54] was going to do it.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We ought to put our We
[3:05:58] ought to put everything we got in that
[3:06:01] &gt;&gt; that what God does and says, he can't
[3:06:04] change his mind. So, what do we do,
[3:06:06] though? We go, I'm going to change my
[3:06:09] mind about that. No, you need to get
[3:06:11] over in his mind and it may change your
[3:06:13] mind.
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; But when we get into these seals,
[3:06:17] listen, the seals is not this great uh,
[3:06:19] you know, drawings and and horses and
[3:06:22] and you know, I'm going to I'm going to
[3:06:24] draw you a big picture over here, you
[3:06:25] know, and I'm going to have stuff
[3:06:26] blowing up and No,
[3:06:30] the seals were given to us to show
[3:06:33] expose the devil,
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; Who he is, what he's doing, and why he's
[3:06:38] here. But I'm going to tell you
[3:06:40] something. You know what the seals have
[3:06:41] done? The seals tell us where we're
[3:06:43] going, where we've been, where we going,
[3:06:45] why we're here, and all that.
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; It's for me and you because it's for
[3:06:50] your redemption.
[3:06:53] &gt;&gt; You can read all this and you can have
[3:06:54] all these charts and all these horses
[3:06:56] and all. It's for your redemption.
[3:07:00] &gt;&gt; It's for your perfection.
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; It's for your day of grace.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; In other ain't getting to grace anyway.
[3:07:07] You got to give me some grace here today
[3:07:09] for a little bit.
[3:07:13] &gt;&gt; Y'all sang for an hour. I'm gonna preach
[3:07:15] for three. So it's triple. You get
[3:07:17] triple time. So
[3:07:19] &gt;&gt; no, that's okay. But a red horse is
[3:07:21] what? It comes up to the next rider. Now
[3:07:23] remember that white righteous horse is
[3:07:25] still riding.
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; It's riding today.
[3:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:07:29] &gt;&gt; And and and as I said before, God is the
[3:07:32] one that is an exclusionist
[3:07:35] or a segregator. I'm not.
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; I have people in the denominations that
[3:07:41] I love, but I know if that system eats
[3:07:43] them up, they're not going to heaven.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Brandham. And when he
[3:07:48] gets to these seals, he said, "I know
[3:07:50] now why I hated that system so bad."
[3:07:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it comes straight from the
[3:07:57] devil.
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; Every denomination
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; come from the devil.
[3:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:05] never did come from God.
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; And there's 13,000 of them now according
[3:08:10] to the internet. And the internet's
[3:08:12] always right. So,
[3:08:15] [snorts]
[3:08:16] &gt;&gt; what are y'all laughing for? Google it.
[3:08:20] It's like the other day, you know, I was
[3:08:22] u talking about Jesus, you know, being
[3:08:25] born in a manger, and we always thought
[3:08:26] it was a wood manger with hay. It
[3:08:28] wasn't. It's a piece of granite that was
[3:08:31] heuned out. Well, the guys in Ohio
[3:08:34] because what happened was in the city of
[3:08:36] Bethlehem is where they raised the
[3:08:40] the perfect lambs
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; because remember the lamb can't have a
[3:08:45] blemish,
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:08:48] &gt;&gt; So, they would bring those lambs in.
[3:08:50] [laughter]
[3:08:51] How perfect is this? They bring those
[3:08:54] lambs in and they'd be birthed on this
[3:08:56] hollow piece.
[3:08:59] Jesus was born on a slab of granite and
[3:09:02] they laid his body on a slab of granite,
[3:09:04] but it's a h it's a hollowed out piece
[3:09:07] of granite and that's where the baby
[3:09:08] lambs are and they can wash them and
[3:09:10] keep them and and make sure that they're
[3:09:12] perfect. So, a manger is where you keep
[3:09:16] cows, but but that thing that he was put
[3:09:19] in was not a piece of wood. And if it's
[3:09:22] on it's online, just look it up. It's
[3:09:24] got to be true. It is true because I re
[3:09:27] researched it. It is where Bethlehem is
[3:09:30] where they had the greatest amount of
[3:09:32] perfect animals,
[3:09:34] perfect lambs for sacrifice cuz you got
[3:09:36] to have them. I mean, they're
[3:09:37] sacrificing all the time,
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; And they would put him on that and you
[3:09:42] can see if you look it up, it's it's
[3:09:43] just about this big and it's hollowed
[3:09:45] out.
[3:09:48] So, the group from Ohio, they were
[3:09:50] having a um Christmas theme, you know,
[3:09:54] party and a show or put on production.
[3:09:59] Brother Elisha sent me a message. He
[3:10:00] said, "Now, we got to get rid of this
[3:10:02] wood thing now. What are we going to do?
[3:10:04] [laughter]
[3:10:05] Where are we going to find a slab of
[3:10:07] granite?"
[3:10:09] I said, "Don't worry about it, brother.
[3:10:10] Just it's okay." But, you know, the
[3:10:13] things that we hear, we sometimes we
[3:10:15] don't research. We just go, "Yeah, well,
[3:10:16] he was born in a manger. He was born in
[3:10:18] a a bail of hay or you know that's not
[3:10:21] what it was. And the and the the where
[3:10:24] he was born was it wasn't a a stable
[3:10:27] like we think stable.
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; It was a cave
[3:10:30] &gt;&gt; built into the side of a mountain.
[3:10:34] &gt;&gt; He was buried in a cave inside of a
[3:10:38] mountain.
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; He began that way. He ended that way.
[3:10:44] But praise God, he didn't stay that way.
[3:10:46] That's right.
[3:10:47] &gt;&gt; He came into mind in your heart. And now
[3:10:49] &gt;&gt; we have the devil's answer.
[3:10:53] &gt;&gt; You shall hear wars and rumors of wars.
[3:10:54] I'm not even going to get. So anyway,
[3:10:57] see that you be not troubled. Now
[3:11:00] listen. Hold on. Let's go back. This is
[3:11:03] Jesus talking to his 12 disciples.
[3:11:06] Judas ain't gonna make it.
[3:11:09] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Judas ain't gonna make it. But
[3:11:11] the other 11 are just, you know, when
[3:11:14] are you coming back?
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; All right. When are these things going
[3:11:18] to happen?
[3:11:20] What's a sign of the end?
[3:11:23] [snorts]
[3:11:23] &gt;&gt; He answered all three.
[3:11:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:11:26] &gt;&gt; Then he comes back. Death, burial,
[3:11:29] resurrection. He comes back and gets
[3:11:31] ready to ascend. What do they ask him?
[3:11:35] When are you going to restore Israel?
[3:11:36] When are you going to do this? When?
[3:11:38] They understand where he said.
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[3:11:41] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't for them.
[3:11:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says it ain't for you.
[3:11:47] &gt;&gt; It's for another group of people that's
[3:11:48] coming.
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; For a special group of people.
[3:11:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He gave it to us. Come on
[3:11:56] people. He gave it to us.
[3:11:59] &gt;&gt; Good Lord. You s watch a stinking
[3:12:01] football game yesterday watching some of
[3:12:03] them playoffs and I'm sorry. That's
[3:12:05] that's one of my weaknesses.
[3:12:08] But I looked at them. There was one guy,
[3:12:11] his name was Sterling Sharp. He played
[3:12:12] football for University of Miami
[3:12:15] years ago. He's an old man. He acted
[3:12:18] like a 12-y old.
[3:12:21] When Miami scored that touchdown, he was
[3:12:24] I'm going to get in my errand mode now.
[3:12:26] He was
[3:12:28] screaming. Got down on his knees and
[3:12:30] wow, like worshiping.
[3:12:32] And we go, "Praise the Lord. [snorts]
[3:12:37] Got [clears throat] the great Got the
[3:12:38] greatest message there ever was.
[3:12:42] Got Jesus in my heart.
[3:12:45] [snorts]
[3:12:51] &gt;&gt; It would change if it was your favorite
[3:12:52] team.
[3:12:56] &gt;&gt; But that's what the world does. I mean,
[3:12:59] &gt;&gt; they go overboard.
[3:13:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; But I just want to get in your heart and
[3:13:05] you live it. Because see, they're going
[3:13:06] they just live like the devil anyway,
[3:13:08] but they going to live like the devil
[3:13:09] tomorrow. And when the ball game's over,
[3:13:11] they going to go back to living. Yeah.
[3:13:14] &gt;&gt; But this is eternal.
[3:13:16] &gt;&gt; This is something you can draw from
[3:13:18] every day. Everything you need is right
[3:13:21] here. You just draw from that source.
[3:13:24] &gt;&gt; So, here's Jesus standing here talking
[3:13:26] to them. They're asking him the
[3:13:28] questions and he's telling them the
[3:13:30] whole answer. And then when they get to
[3:13:32] the very end
[3:13:34] over here when he ascends, they ask him
[3:13:37] about basically the same questions,
[3:13:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:13:40] &gt;&gt; When are you going to take over? When
[3:13:41] you going to do this, when you going to
[3:13:42] do that?
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; He just shakes his head and goes on into
[3:13:47] glory. Cuz remember what he said, we
[3:13:50] won't read it, but where Jesus washes
[3:13:52] the feet and he says, "Now you'll not
[3:13:53] understand now, but you will hereafter."
[3:13:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:13:56] &gt;&gt; Because there was a lot of things they
[3:13:57] were going to understand. But now
[3:13:58] remember, I want you to remember one
[3:13:59] thing.
[3:14:01] This message that Jesus preached in
[3:14:03] Matthew 24 was so special.
[3:14:07] &gt;&gt; The disciples never preached it.
[3:14:15] &gt;&gt; That's the opening of the seals.
[3:14:19] &gt;&gt; They didn't get it.
[3:14:21] &gt;&gt; And there stood the headstone right
[3:14:23] there in front of them telling them the
[3:14:25] who the six are,
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; the six seals. And there stood number
[3:14:28] seven telling them
[3:14:31] &gt;&gt; where I'm at, what I'm going to do, what
[3:14:33] the devil's going to do, what I'm going
[3:14:34] to do.
[3:14:36] &gt;&gt; And they missed it completely.
[3:14:40] &gt;&gt; So when brother Ram stood there on the
[3:14:41] six on the questions and answers, he
[3:14:43] said, "It's not for you."
[3:14:46] &gt;&gt; You know why he said it's not for you?
[3:14:47] It's just the same thing with Jesus
[3:14:49] standing there telling them all that
[3:14:50] because brother Ram said, and I've got
[3:14:51] it on here. We'll read it maybe whatever
[3:14:53] Sunday we're done coming back here. But
[3:14:55] he said,
[3:14:57] Jesus said, he said, "These is what's
[3:14:59] this is what's going to happen." Brother
[3:15:00] Ram says, "Okay, this is all this is
[3:15:02] what's going to happen,
[3:15:04] &gt;&gt; right?"
[3:15:04] &gt;&gt; And they're like, "We don't get it. We
[3:15:07] don't understand."
[3:15:10] &gt;&gt; But Brother Ram knew that because
[3:15:11] Brother Ram asked him, he said, I think
[3:15:13] it was on the fourth seal. He said,
[3:15:15] "Look, we're going to have we're going
[3:15:16] to have a prayer line, remember?" He
[3:15:18] said, "We're going to have questions and
[3:15:20] answers." He said, "Make it on the I got
[3:15:22] to read that."
[3:15:24] So thisten to listen to how this is
[3:15:27] William Brandham.
[3:15:29] All right. This is a guy that he's here
[3:15:33] for a purpose
[3:15:35] &gt;&gt; to call a group of people. All right.
[3:15:38] Everybody with me?
[3:15:40] &gt;&gt; Let me get Let me get down here.
[3:15:43] Excuse me for a minute. I want to read
[3:15:45] it while you say it.
[3:15:51] Okay, right here this the scripture I
[3:15:54] broke for John 13:7. Jesus answered and
[3:15:56] said unto them, "What I do, thou knowest
[3:15:59] not." Now, this is in the foot washing,
[3:16:00] "But thou shalt know hereafter." Then
[3:16:03] Peter said, "Thou shalt never wash my
[3:16:05] feet." Don't ever tell Jesus never
[3:16:08] &gt;&gt; because he'll embarrass you. But on the
[3:16:10] fourth seal, now watch he said, "Now in
[3:16:12] studying this, now don't forget now
[3:16:13] Sunday or Sunday morning, we omitted the
[3:16:16] healing service because of having the
[3:16:19] answers to the people's question." Now
[3:16:21] watch what he wanted. This is what he
[3:16:22] wanted. Now I want you to have a
[3:16:25] question on these seven seals.
[3:16:30] &gt;&gt; If it's bothering you, something that
[3:16:32] you don't understand, let's have it on
[3:16:34] the seven seals. Then I can tell my
[3:16:36] Saturday night whether it's enough to
[3:16:38] answer them or not. You see? And then
[3:16:41] just now, now watch. He tells them, "Do
[3:16:43] not ask about I had a dream."
[3:16:48] All right. And then just now say, "Well,
[3:16:50] about something else or or should I do
[3:16:52] this or or or my I had a dream." Them
[3:16:55] them's all worthy things. Now, remember,
[3:16:57] they're worthy things, but let's stay
[3:16:59] right with the seven seals.
[3:17:01] &gt;&gt; That's what we're right on. That's what
[3:17:04] the meeting is designed to do. The seven
[3:17:06] seals. Let's stay right with that
[3:17:10] &gt;&gt; now. The day he had questions and
[3:17:11] answers, [clears throat] he got two
[3:17:13] questions on the seals and 26 questions
[3:17:16] on should women wear pajamas.
[3:17:21] &gt;&gt; Explain the new birth. Explain father,
[3:17:24] son, holy ghost is not the right
[3:17:26] baptism. And of course, he explains them
[3:17:28] all. But by that time, you know what he
[3:17:29] says?
[3:17:31] He read them questions before he came
[3:17:33] out and that's when he told him. He
[3:17:36] said, "You're not getting this."
[3:17:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not for you either." I
[3:17:40] believe the Lord revealed it to him that
[3:17:41] it was not for them.
[3:17:43] &gt;&gt; If not, then that would have been it
[3:17:44] would have drove me crazy.
[3:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:47] &gt;&gt; Knowing that that week was the greatest
[3:17:48] week of ministry, he said, "I've ever
[3:17:50] had in my life." [snorts]
[3:17:52] &gt;&gt; And nobody understood what he's talking
[3:17:53] about.
[3:17:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus standing here,
[3:17:57] I'm the Messiah.
[3:17:59] I'm here to save you and I'm here to
[3:18:02] give you this revelation and you're
[3:18:04] still wanting to know am I going to
[3:18:06] destroy Rome?
[3:18:08] &gt;&gt; That's what they were asking him.
[3:18:10] &gt;&gt; Remember somebody said, one of the
[3:18:11] commentators said they wanted Jesus just
[3:18:13] grab a big sword out and just, you know,
[3:18:15] chunk all the Romans and throw them out
[3:18:16] and and then we're back to a millennium.
[3:18:19] &gt;&gt; No, they just missed the time of the
[3:18:21] millennium.
[3:18:23] &gt;&gt; It's later on down the road.
[3:18:26] But to imagine a man right here, he
[3:18:29] says, "Then [snorts] also knowing right
[3:18:32] among you things are happening. I know
[3:18:35] you that you don't see it." See, I'm
[3:18:39] just positive that you don't see it. And
[3:18:41] you say, "Brother Brown, that's a hard
[3:18:43] thing for you to say that. I know it
[3:18:45] is." But look, let me just say this now.
[3:18:48] I suppose this is just taped for our
[3:18:50] self and so forth. Thank God it was for
[3:18:52] us. But let me say this that you don't
[3:18:55] get it.
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; See, and you're not supposed to get it.
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; So don't try to interpret anything. Of
[3:19:04] course, they didn't listen to that. They
[3:19:06] tried to interpreted, you know, polygamy
[3:19:08] and all that other junk as being the
[3:19:09] seals.
[3:19:11] &gt;&gt; Don't try to put your interpretation to
[3:19:13] it. You only get further away. Take my
[3:19:15] advice. If you believe in me now, if God
[3:19:18] has given me favor in your sight and you
[3:19:20] know that them revelations and things,
[3:19:22] I've been here with you a long time and
[3:19:24] it's going and it's always been right
[3:19:26] now to double prove it right hooks right
[3:19:28] in with the word. See, you know, it's
[3:19:29] thus sayeth the Lord, it's proved to
[3:19:32] you. But they didn't know what he was
[3:19:33] talking about.
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is out there preaching his
[3:19:36] heart out. Nobody understood what he was
[3:19:38] saying.
[3:19:40] &gt;&gt; When are you going to restore Israel?
[3:19:42] When are you going to do this? When are
[3:19:43] you going to do that? You know, and and
[3:19:46] We look at what brother Brandon went
[3:19:47] through. We look what Jesus went
[3:19:49] through. I want us not to go through
[3:19:50] that here
[3:19:53] &gt;&gt; all over the whole bride of Jesus
[3:19:55] Christ. We got to get this or we don't
[3:19:57] make it to the body change.
[3:19:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to get it
[3:20:01] &gt;&gt; because it's been spoke.
[3:20:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody will.
[3:20:07] &gt;&gt; But remember,
[3:20:09] Judas was among that group.
[3:20:15] and stayed there
[3:20:18] until the crucifixion
[3:20:21] &gt;&gt; right up to the time because remember
[3:20:22] you hung yourself and then Jesus got put
[3:20:24] on the cross right
[3:20:26] &gt;&gt; that's how close it is he was sitting
[3:20:28] right there eating the same food I'm
[3:20:31] talking about everything everything he
[3:20:33] ate was right there with them he was
[3:20:37] among them and he deceived every one of
[3:20:39] them but the son of man
[3:20:42] we're going to stop right here cuz it's
[3:20:44] it's hot up here, too.
[3:20:47] It's just 70°.
[3:20:49] Boy, if I was jumping around for my
[3:20:51] favorite team, I'd probably be sweating
[3:20:52] all over the place. This is my favorite
[3:20:55] team.
[3:20:56] &gt;&gt; And I am sweating a little bit.
[3:20:59] [applause]
[3:21:01] So, we look, but we'll close right here.
[3:21:03] I We'll get started somewhere else.
[3:21:05] We're just on the red horse. But each
[3:21:07] one of these horses are a symbol of a
[3:21:10] power
[3:21:12] &gt;&gt; that Satan is using.
[3:21:14] Okay.
[3:21:15] &gt;&gt; Red or white, red, black, and pale. Now,
[3:21:20] what is a pale horse? It's all three of
[3:21:22] these wrapped up together.
[3:21:26] &gt;&gt; If you'll do that sometime, take white
[3:21:28] paint, red paint, and black paint, put
[3:21:31] it in a bucket, and stir it up. It's the
[3:21:33] most putrid, ugly looking color you'll
[3:21:35] ever see in your life. But that's what
[3:21:37] the pale horse is in this day and age
[3:21:39] right here.
[3:21:41] It's all culminating into one.
[3:21:44] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you something else.
[3:21:46] There's a church. There's a bride that
[3:21:49] has a real white horse.
[3:21:51] &gt;&gt; It's called justification.
[3:21:54] &gt;&gt; We have a real red horse, which is
[3:21:56] sanctification.
[3:21:57] &gt;&gt; We have a real black horse. You say
[3:21:59] that's bad. No, it ain't. Cuz you got to
[3:22:00] die.
[3:22:02] &gt;&gt; You got to die. The Holy Ghost, you got
[3:22:04] to die. Or if you ain't dead, then who's
[3:22:06] alive? Come on.
[3:22:08] &gt;&gt; And then what? The fourth thing is all
[3:22:11] that wrapped up into one and we get out
[3:22:13] of here.
[3:22:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember the rapture takes place on
[3:22:16] the fourth seal.
[3:22:18] &gt;&gt; And we'll explain all that. But re
[3:22:20] remember if brother Brandham can tell
[3:22:22] us, we ought to be able to preach it.
[3:22:25] &gt;&gt; I believe the seals are open. I believe
[3:22:26] that we can read the book just like
[3:22:28] brother Brandham did the Bible.
[3:22:30] &gt;&gt; And then we can take the prophet's
[3:22:31] message and we can mesh them together
[3:22:34] &gt;&gt; because that's what Jesus did. Now
[3:22:36] remember though, Jesus preached the
[3:22:37] seals in a symbol form and he was
[3:22:40] pointing towards something
[3:22:44] &gt;&gt; cuz I I don't have it in here, but
[3:22:46] remember after he got finished with the
[3:22:48] sixth seal,
[3:22:52] he stopped
[3:22:54] and he said, "Now let's look at the fig
[3:22:57] tree."
[3:23:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, six seals finish his
[3:23:03] redemption.
[3:23:04] The seventh is his coming.
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; He was standing there already on earth.
[3:23:09] He went through all these and the last
[3:23:10] thing he said, he said, "Oh, oh,
[3:23:14] there's a parable
[3:23:16] of a fig tree
[3:23:18] &gt;&gt; that we need to talk about."
[3:23:20] &gt;&gt; So, he diverted every bit of that back
[3:23:22] to Israel. Well, guess what we're doing
[3:23:23] when we get finished here? Not here, not
[3:23:25] here physically. When we get finished in
[3:23:27] the Revelation, this all is going to
[3:23:30] Israel
[3:23:32] &gt;&gt; to two prophets. No Gentiles are going
[3:23:34] over there. Sorry about that. I was uh
[3:23:37] listening coming back from Kentucky the
[3:23:39] other day where brother Brandham uh he
[3:23:41] was preaching. He said, "Oh," he said,
[3:23:42] "That's my ministry." You know, he went
[3:23:43] to Egypt,
[3:23:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:23:46] &gt;&gt; He thought he was going to take them
[3:23:47] out. If he would have done that, he'd
[3:23:48] have broke every scripture in the Bible
[3:23:50] &gt;&gt; and there would have been a a rapture of
[3:23:52] a bunch of Jews,
[3:23:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:23:54] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that bad, but there'd
[3:23:56] be a rapture of them and not us
[3:23:58] &gt;&gt; because a prophet goes to them. They'll
[3:23:59] believe the prophet if he' went over
[3:24:01] there. Yeah. They'd have believed it
[3:24:03] because when Moses and Elijah goes over
[3:24:05] there in type or in spirit, they going
[3:24:08] to believe them. It's only going to take
[3:24:09] them three and a half years. It's took
[3:24:11] us 60
[3:24:13] &gt;&gt; to figure this thing out. And we ain't
[3:24:15] got it all figured out yet.
[3:24:17] &gt;&gt; But in three and a half years, it's
[3:24:18] going to be like boom boom boom boom
[3:24:19] boom boom boom.
[3:24:21] &gt;&gt; But it's Listen, it's this message. It
[3:24:23] is not a Baptist message, a Pentecostal
[3:24:26] message. It's this message right here.
[3:24:27] Amen.
[3:24:28] &gt;&gt; This message through two prophets
[3:24:30] revealing Jesus Christ to a bunch of
[3:24:33] people that didn't care about him to
[3:24:35] begin with.
[3:24:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:24:38] &gt;&gt; They still looking for him, folks.
[3:24:40] &gt;&gt; They're still looking for Christ.
[3:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's why they're going to say, "Oops,
[3:24:45] we're in trouble.
[3:24:47] &gt;&gt; He's already We're looking for him. He's
[3:24:49] already come. He's already been through
[3:24:51] seven church ages. He's already been
[3:24:53] through a prophet in the end time, our
[3:24:55] Elijah." All right.
[3:24:57] &gt;&gt; And they're looking for their Elijah.
[3:24:59] &gt;&gt; And he'll come.
[3:25:01] &gt;&gt; No doubt.
[3:25:02] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. He'll come. But
[3:25:06] it will come from this message right
[3:25:07] here. And it will come to them no sooner
[3:25:14] it will be when we are ready and take a
[3:25:17] rapture.
[3:25:18] &gt;&gt; He will not deal with the Jews until
[3:25:21] you and I are out of here.
[3:25:24] Joseph sent his gentile bride to the
[3:25:26] palace before he revealed himself to his
[3:25:29] brothers.
[3:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:25:30] &gt;&gt; So they were in that palace. She was in
[3:25:33] that palace with the two kids they had.
[3:25:37] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] then he comes down and he
[3:25:38] reveals himself to little Benjamin,
[3:25:41] which is the type of the what 144,000.
[3:25:43] Because Benjamin was his brother,
[3:25:45] &gt;&gt; real brother by blood. The rest of them
[3:25:47] were concubines and different things,
[3:25:48] but Joseph and uh and Benjamin were true
[3:25:51] brothers. So, but Lord, you could you
[3:25:54] could preach on that a long time, too.
[3:25:55] But God bless you.
[3:25:58] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you. Just listen to what
[3:26:00] don't listen to me. I said a long time
[3:26:03] ago, I wish to God that you could put a
[3:26:06] screen across or or a curtain across
[3:26:09] here and just listen to the voice of the
[3:26:10] person.
[3:26:12] &gt;&gt; Not look at the humanity and look at the
[3:26:14] how I do things and how I look and how I
[3:26:17] act. Just listen to the words.
[3:26:20] Just listen to the voice of God talking
[3:26:22] to you.
[3:26:23] &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll do that, then you'll shed
[3:26:25] all that other stuff
[3:26:26] &gt;&gt; and God will really be able to speak to
[3:26:28] you.
[3:26:31] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord,
[3:26:33] &gt;&gt; then you got to love me
[3:26:36] &gt;&gt; cuz he's inside of me, too.
[3:26:40] &gt;&gt; You might not like my quirks every once
[3:26:41] in a while, but Brother Gabriel does. He
[3:26:44] likes me. Amen.
[3:26:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe his wife. Jury's out, but
[3:26:50] maybe Sister Rebecca.
[3:26:52] Lord, I've known him since they were all
[3:26:54] little. Little little kids. She Now they
[3:26:57] got Now they got big kids.
[3:27:00] Thomas
[3:27:01] Shorty.
[3:27:04] &gt;&gt; It's good to see these kids come up.
[3:27:05] Amen.
[3:27:06] &gt;&gt; It's good to see them come up and and be
[3:27:09] around, sing,
[3:27:10] &gt;&gt; worship,
[3:27:12] &gt;&gt; be in service,
[3:27:14] &gt;&gt; and grow up
[3:27:17] like them. We're baby babies.
[3:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what? Until the Lord
[3:27:23] comes, we're just going to keep carrying
[3:27:25] on.
[3:27:26] &gt;&gt; Okay? We're going to keep going on.
[3:27:28] We're going to keep trying our best.
[3:27:29] We're going to keep trying. We're going
[3:27:31] to keep trying to number one expose the
[3:27:35] devil.
[3:27:36] &gt;&gt; Expose him for what he is
[3:27:39] &gt;&gt; and then what? Then put Jesus Christ in
[3:27:42] the forefront because a lot of times we
[3:27:44] don't. A lot of times we put Come on.
[3:27:47] &gt;&gt; We get in the way a lot. Well, is it us
[3:27:49] or is it the devil? The devil knows if
[3:27:50] he can get you to re to believe him,
[3:27:55] &gt;&gt; he's got you. That's right.
[3:27:57] &gt;&gt; But somewhere in there, there's got to
[3:27:59] be something inside of you. Like brother
[3:28:01] Ram said, he said, "The devil told me
[3:28:04] the truth."
[3:28:05] &gt;&gt; Remember when the devil told him in his
[3:28:07] ear, he said, "Your baby's dying. Your
[3:28:09] wife's dying. Dead. Your baby's dying.
[3:28:12] What are you going to do?" He said, "I
[3:28:14] almost listened to what he said."
[3:28:18] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. You would have thought
[3:28:20] there was angels hovered over brother
[3:28:22] Brana, but no, he was a human
[3:28:24] &gt;&gt; in a situation as Job. And then
[3:28:29] Satan couldn't understand when when when
[3:28:31] brother Ram just looked over to the side
[3:28:33] and he said, "Though God slay me,
[3:28:35] &gt;&gt; yes,
[3:28:36] &gt;&gt; yet I'll trust him."
[3:28:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.
[3:28:42] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[3:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we've got to be.
[3:28:46] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Every
[3:28:49] trial we go through,
[3:28:51] &gt;&gt; it's the Lord. If you're a child of his,
[3:28:54] why will he give you a stone if you ask
[3:28:56] for bread? Why will he give you a
[3:28:58] scorpion if you ask for other something
[3:28:59] else? He can't do that. He'll let you go
[3:29:02] through things, but remember, they're
[3:29:04] light afflictions.
[3:29:06] &gt;&gt; We're trying to escape a place
[3:29:09] that's going to be horrible.
[3:29:11] &gt;&gt; Horrible. You'll never know. And I hope
[3:29:14] you don't ever know.
[3:29:15] &gt;&gt; If you're a bride of Jesus Christ, you
[3:29:17] will never know. Amen.
[3:29:18] &gt;&gt; The torment that's going to be.
[3:29:21] &gt;&gt; And then one day, I like what Kirk
[3:29:23] Cameron said. Finally, he's he isn't
[3:29:25] standing up. I mean, he they keep
[3:29:26] bashing him inside the head, but he's
[3:29:28] like, "No." He said, "You ain't going to
[3:29:31] burn eternally." He said, "You going to
[3:29:33] burn up one day,
[3:29:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:29:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what you'll do. Think about
[3:29:37] it. You exist as a human being right
[3:29:40] now. All of you, we're all human beings.
[3:29:42] We all have family, past, we all have
[3:29:46] &gt;&gt; memories.
[3:29:48] one day if you're not born again, you
[3:29:51] just disappear,
[3:29:53] &gt;&gt; like you never was to begin with.
[3:29:58] &gt;&gt; To me, that's horrible
[3:30:00] &gt;&gt; because the bride now, we ain't going to
[3:30:01] remember the real bad things, but we're
[3:30:03] going to remember the things that we
[3:30:04] were down here. We're going to remember
[3:30:05] that we were human beings. We're going
[3:30:06] to remember we went through trials and
[3:30:08] tribulations because that's that's our
[3:30:10] testimony, right? Because the angels,
[3:30:13] they're just going to stand there and
[3:30:14] go, "I don't know what you're going
[3:30:15] through. I never was that way. And you
[3:30:17] say, and you say, "Oh, man. If it hadn't
[3:30:20] been for that guy right over there on
[3:30:21] that throne,
[3:30:22] &gt;&gt; if it hadn't been for him, I'd have
[3:30:25] never made it."
[3:30:26] &gt;&gt; Put your eyes on Jesus,
[3:30:28] &gt;&gt; not on [snorts] another man.
[3:30:30] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. God bless you.

[3:33:54] Even if you got the Holy Ghost, let him
[3:33:56] come on in a little bit more. Let him
[3:33:58] come on in a little more.

[3:38:37] Trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost
[3:38:41] [music] come in.
[3:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a simple thing, you know,
[3:38:48] he's he's wanting to knock on the door.
[3:38:50] He knocks. All you got to do is open the
[3:38:53] door.
[3:38:54] I like that uh message brother Vine
[3:38:56] preached without money and without
[3:38:59] price.
[3:39:00] What a powerful message
[3:39:03] that this world and I'm not I'm not
[3:39:06] belittling anyone that likes to make
[3:39:08] money cuz money in your pocket makes you
[3:39:10] feel better. Okay? But when we make it
[3:39:13] our God
[3:39:14] and we build up a kingdom here and we
[3:39:18] let our kingdom in heaven starve
[3:39:20] &gt;&gt; or go bankrupt.
[3:39:23] But there's no price. There's no price
[3:39:25] to this.
[3:39:27] The only thing we got to do is just
[3:39:29] yield to him and live. He's already
[3:39:31] wrote the pres. Listen, prescriptions
[3:39:33] written and and brothers and sisters, he
[3:39:35] can't change this. So, he's not going to
[3:39:38] in the middle of a in the middle of a
[3:39:40] trial, he's going to go, "No, I don't.
[3:39:42] No, don't trust this. I'm going to give
[3:39:43] you another." No, he's got this right
[3:39:45] here.
[3:39:47] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[3:39:49] &gt;&gt; This is the thing we need. And then when
[3:39:51] we have this, Brother Manuel, when we
[3:39:54] have this, it'll point us to the message
[3:39:56] of the hour.
[3:39:57] &gt;&gt; And then we'll have more clarity and
[3:40:00] we'll have the between the lines that
[3:40:02] Jesus was telling. Cuz remember, he I'm
[3:40:05] going to start preaching again. He was
[3:40:06] preaching the seals to us.
[3:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:40:10] &gt;&gt; That was my whole point. He wasn't
[3:40:11] preaching it to them. Brother Brandham
[3:40:12] wasn't preaching the seals to those
[3:40:14] people sitting in that auditorium. He
[3:40:16] was preaching them to us.
[3:40:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:40:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz he didn't say now nobody's ever
[3:40:21] going to get it. No, he said you're not
[3:40:23] going to get it
[3:40:24] &gt;&gt; and you're not supposed to get it, but
[3:40:27] there's a group that'll get it.
[3:40:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus has got more patience than we do
[3:40:32] cuz he knew they weren't going to get
[3:40:34] it.
[3:40:35] He's going to have to die though so they
[3:40:38] could try to get it.
[3:40:40] &gt;&gt; And we have to die out to oursel so that
[3:40:43] we can get it. That's all we got to do.
[3:40:45] Die it to oursel and we can get it. If
[3:40:49] we put self in the way, we always fail.
[3:40:53] &gt;&gt; Don't ever say, "I did something."
[3:40:56] No, [music] you say Lord willing I'll do
[3:41:00] this or the Lord did this for me or the
[3:41:02] Lord even in a trial
[3:41:05] say the Lord just did this for me. Hey,
[3:41:07] listen. Remember brother Louise and
[3:41:09] Sister Christine and the girls maybe
[3:41:11] they'll quit traveling one day and but
[3:41:14] but Sister Christine's going to see her
[3:41:16] family and we sure we sure love her
[3:41:18] family and appreciate them [music] and
[3:41:20] uh we appreciate them letting her go
[3:41:22] come back.
[3:41:24] Same way with Joe and and Rachel.
[3:41:26] They're on their way to New Mexico to
[3:41:27] her family. So, if [music] we can get
[3:41:29] all them people to move out here like
[3:41:30] somebody else is
[3:41:33] Hello, somebody.
[3:41:35] [clears throat]
[3:41:36] I need to stop before I start saying
[3:41:38] anything again. I guess I'll just
[3:41:42] I guess not. It's in my heart.
[3:41:45] I love family. Y'all know we we love
[3:41:47] family
[3:41:48] &gt;&gt; and I love my church family. I love to
[3:41:51] be around believers. Why would you want
[3:41:53] to be around
[3:41:55] a bunch of drunks? And
[3:41:59] I don't feel comfortable.
[3:42:01] I don't feel If you feel comfortable
[3:42:04] in your world,
[3:42:07] you in pro, you got a problem.
[3:42:10] &gt;&gt; I just don't feel comfortable
[3:42:13] because I'm like Abraham.
[3:42:16] I'm looking for a city [music]
[3:42:18] whose builder and maker is God. And what
[3:42:21] did brother Ram say? He said, Abraham
[3:42:23] didn't know it, but he was standing
[3:42:24] right on top of the city he was looking
[3:42:25] for.
[3:42:27] &gt;&gt; Well, we're looking for a city, but we
