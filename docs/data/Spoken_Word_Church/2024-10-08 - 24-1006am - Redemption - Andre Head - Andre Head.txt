we got several out brother Lis is in North Carolina to meeting there and brother uh Bob is actually at brother Andre's uh preaching today so um just want to give you a little uh update on the relief effort um our website now has a link to the word of life and Bible Believers I think they got it somewhere they pull it up so what we're going to do is and as a church and brother Andre will reiterate this because he's been up there and his wife's been up there they're right in the middle of it um the best thing for us to do is send money if we go up there we're just going to be a third wheel fifth wheel they're going to have to take care of you they're going to have to feed you they're going to have if you got something to take up there take it up there and get back home but it's going to take you about 5 and a half hours to get there going from here brother Andre and his wife are leaving right after service today and um they're heading on up there because they live there they know and the people in The Word of Life they know who needs the thing it's well coordinated those are the two um links for Word of Life Johnson City and they've got several hundred people working uh brother Michael Bailey is uh I just wrote him a check from the church for $1,000 prise the Lord y'all did it I didn't for to send to get fun to get things water and things that they can buy up there that we don't need to take from here now brother brother Andre we've been talking about this just it's the best thing to do is to send them money so if you have there's a link there this is the one for Hickory Bible Tabernacle we're going to send them some too and then we're going to take up an offering here in just a minute for the vision books but they know what they're doing so let's let them do what they know what to do because as what as we were talking if I were to go up there then that people want to talk and people you know you're a different per you're you're you're not in their community so if you got something send money send money because if you don't you're going to have to find a place to stay you going to have to find all these different things just let them worry about it we'll send them money we'll send the money from here and if you have anything to give go there to venmo the word of life's church and then we're going to give some to Hickory Bible Tabernacle today but just remember that this is going to be an ongoing thing it's going to take up to a year for some of them to even get back to normaly a year amen some have no power still some have power brother Joe Green said they just got power this morning uh some of the places wiped out um and where brother Andre lives the bridges are gone in places and it's going to be a year before they get them Bill back so they're going to have to go home today because they're starting tomorrow being up there with them because he lives there in Irwin and and the nich Chucky river is not but a mile or so from his house so he was right I mean he was up high but it was right there close to his uh to his house and it affected not so much as people in the church but it affected a lot of people people around there the factories and all the different things that have some have been totally wiped out so we're going to send them some relief to Word of Life we're going to send some to Bible Believers and then today we're going to take up the offerings for Bible Believers for the vision books remember what I said $20 whatever you can give now what you give today will go to that fund now if you and you pay your ti separate everybody with me pay your ti your ti go as write that down but if you want some of that money or that another check to go run through the church write on it Relief Fund for Bible Tabernacle relief for Bible Tabernacle all right in Hickory North Carolina all right everybody got that all right when we take up the offering it'll be one offering we're not going to take up two one offering and as we pass a collection plate if you want to just hang on and tell sister Lisa after the service is over hey I want to take this and give this to this you just give it to her and then you decide where it needs to go but if you got your cash and uh some have been giving me some I got some I got some folded up 20s amen they might be a folded up 50 in there we never know but but take this and we're going to give this to this is for vision books all right this is for buying the books those books are they can make them for 8 cents a piece and and church AE books for 80 something cents a piece so whatever this goes it will go directly to that to brother Berry coffee but now remember if you want to give something to the relief fund make it separate everything's got to be separate or

Father how thankful we are to to be in your divine presence Lord and that the great Holy Spirit that's feeding us the only interpreter of the Divine word of God lord we come reverently this morning humbly Lord father as we gather with Believers of like Precious faith those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and Lord that you would come and Quicken that word to our hearts show us our Direction and path you said in your word those who I love I chasen oh Father you are a great heavenly father and we love you so as John said we love him because he first loved us father you know every heart here this morning you you know every need Lord and father how thankful we are Lord that we can approach you believing that you are and that you're a reward of them that diligently seek thee Lord John said Lord whosoever first born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith so Lord this morning as we gather with this lovely group of Believers here in Lula Lord and their Pastor brother Wade given us this invitation Lord and standing behind this sacred desk Lord father we ask Lord that you would come and have your way Lord with each and every heart Lord speak to our hearts Lord as only you can and Lord as the opening of your word in our heart at this season knowing who we are and what we've been raised up for Lord forgive us of our sins and shortcoming things that we may have done to offend Lord forgive us Lord for in your divine presence Lord and we come brother brandham said holy angels covered their faces and cover their feet in humility and with with two they went into action Lord under the influence of the Holy Spirit may we all be under the influence of the holy spirit this morning Lord May our worship go before you Lord as a sweet Savor Lord may you receive our re our worship and praise and may you be glorified be glorified here in Lula Lord be glorified in each and everyone be glorified in my life Lord have your way Lord in jesus' name we pray amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles let's turn to the book of Philippians iians chapter 4 Philippians chapter 4 and we're very thankful my wife and I they're excited to be with you to worship with you this morning and as brother Wade said we came over yesterday afternoon we want to thank God uh for the wonderful anniversary brother Wade and his wife had 45 years and I know she got a lot of patience you know God God bless her God bless I see her over there she's a beautiful lady and she yeah yeah you know and so we want to thank the Lord for them and they're just having a good time together even despite in spite all the the weather and the road closing they got to come together and speak and and it's always a beautiful time when brother Brandy said in that message kinsman's Redeemer when a woman finds a man and loves him it doesn't matter what he looks like but she loves him and he loves her he said that had no beginning it started in glory and he said it won't have an ending being pretty and putting on Max Factor and all those things you have to wash that off reassign and put it on again but that real beauty that comes from the car for the heart that beauty there and so we're certainly happy for precious brother I'm going to have us read Lord willing here in uh Philippians chapter 4 just a couple of vers have you be seated after that and then we'll just kind of go over some things that are happening and then we'll get right into the word we're not I'm not alone windy preacher so don't worry about two hours no I'm just kidding with you so in Philippians chapter 4 we saw brother brother Aaron Roberts brother Aaron and Sister Sarah and their group there they're so precious we love them in Irwin Tennessee and uh brother Aaron was with us him and his family a couple of weeks ago they've always been a great blessing always challenging in us and we thank them and look forward to their coming again also brother brother Bob's there that's right him and his wife his and two of his girls they there in Irwin uh this morning and and they had a good trip up yesterday and also brother Luis uro I know brother Luis from many years when his family first came from um from medine Colombia and so he's uh we we' spent some time together in Mexico and different places uh him being my interpreter and so God bless him and Sister Christina and there two precious girls as uh they're out today and ministering there in North Carolina amen everybody should be there now Philippians chapter 4 this is the Apostle Paul this is one of the they call it prison epistle the Apostle Paul wrote this uh the book of uh Philippi while he was in prison he's dealing with the Christian experience but not the outward Christian experience he's dealing with the inward experience of the believer and growth in those things and so how we thankful to the Lord that the first church age messenger the Apostle Paul he's he's laying down a great principle for us and I I want us to catch that that and then we'll we'll talk about other things Philippians chapter 4 starting at verse 4 rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderations your gentleness your kindness be known unto all men the Lord is at hand The Lord Is With Us be careful for nothing when we think about the time and the season that we're living in we think about uh so much to try to have us to worry and to be depressed and anxiety and and worked over and all kind of different words that would go with that we want to have a strong defense in this hour we're not a defeated people we're Victorious People we were predestinated to stand for this hour once Jesus said in the scriptures in the Book of John should I pray that God would deliver me for for this hour came I into the world and so you and I you know we want to get out of here we want to get out of Satan's Eden we see and there's too much prophecy being brought to pass for us not to be approaching something you see these modern events made clear by prophecy and so when we see these things and see the V indicated word that God has given us in this hour God has always made a way for his children we can stand behind that fortified word of God let me say this with all the strength that I have we're not a religious people we are the sons and daughters of almighty God you see brother Brown said religion is just a covering Christianity is a new birth and so Paul says listen to him verse 6 he says now be careful be anxious for nothing but in everything not some things but in everything by prayer and supplications brother Andre what's that word supplication mean your petitions amen see by prayer and supplications with look at this recipe with Thanksgiving let your request be known unto God so prayer the power of prayer no matter what what you're going through you can bring that before God Satan would try to make you doubt God and doubt your trust in God and doubt who you are and doubt what God made you and and then you say well I have a right to worry but worry has no virtue at all no one ever said you know I overcame this because I worried about it I was so worried I was so anxious I was so unnerved I was so depressed that I overcome this no no no no no no faith is the victory faith in God faith in this word so y'all got me preaching before I wanted to so so let's read this so verse six again be careful for nothing be anxious don't be anxious but in everything not some things by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God because that's what we want yes sir the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your heart shall guard your heart shall protect you from strokes and all these other things see yes they they it's going to take more than there's no mental medicine that has ever cured anyone and I'm not saying that many may be someone in here you say well brother Andre I have to take this psychotrophic drug I have to take paxel I have to take Ridin I have to take DEA code I have to take this and that those things when I worked with the Juvenile Justice of Georgia we had to deal with young people who were on those things so I'm not here to knock those things but I am here to say there is a God that can take care of that see that can give you power that can guard your heart not religion can't do it but God can do it you see so we being the bride of Christ God didn't leave us to that second realm of uh uh reasoning emotion memory all those things we have a revelation of the Soul so Paul goes on down he says and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever Things Are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen of me do he says and the God of Peace shall be with you may the Lord add his Blessing reading of his word you may be seated again my wife and I we're so grateful and thankful to be with you and we thank the Lord Brother Wade he's just been a very encourager in the ministry that God has given him in this great fivefold ministry we thank the Lord for it I want to First tell you all how much I appreciate it brother Dale once again brother Dale meant a lot to us I grew up I'm from Marrietta Georgia originally and when I first come to the mess with with brother Ed Waters I got to know brother Dale and I appreciate it brother Dale I'm not I'm not just here to get favoritism or anything like that far be that but when I met brother Dale I met a man who was dedicated to the word I saw a minister a minister that just was wasn't saying well I got to preach this night let me let me get some kind of context no no no this was a man who dedicated his life yes he did completely to the word of God Amen and certainly god let's give the Lord a hand on that and so much we learned so much I learned in subjects I like like forn knowledge and predestination and all these subjects that you know at that time God was and of course my first Pastor brother Ed Waters and then brother Mike handers I love brother Mike what an incredible teacher of the word 18 years with brother Mike and you know sister htis went to be with the Lord and that was pulled a lot on brother Mike but we love brother htis he's a father in The Gospel to me I love him and so we appreciate those men brother Mike's going to be with us I don't know what day he's going to come up and be with with us there in Irwin Tennessee the Believers in Irwin they send greetings too I was in be you know brother Joseph and I the Lord spoke to our hearts in Soo Canyon uh many years ago about the ministry and sent us to venezuel and those things and so I I only said that so that you know that God gave us the opportunity to do missionary work for 20 25 26 years uh all through Venezuela and the jungle of Venezuela uh down the different Rivers we spent time on the oronoko river uh on the Amazon River and I don't mean going out for two or three days months and months at a time living with the Indians the peor the wah heos the yanam mamies the kakas those Indians there who we have come to love and appreciate so more and then God you know uh he kind of Switched us up now we've been pastoring for a while about five or six years we've known the Believers there in irn but uh there's a island there's quite a few islands in the Granada Dean Islands I lived in Grenada for a while working with the church there and while I was there I went over to a smaller island called Beck Beck and while I was there uh a sister came from one of the churches in Beck I think there's two churches there and she says brother Andre I know who your pastor is the way you preach I know and I said who is my pastor she said Samuel Dale I know that's your pastor I've got tapes of brother Dale and so when I heard you and and the other night uh speaking on predestination I knew where you had learned those things from I said yes I did I I did learn those things from brother brother Dale he's he's been a great foundation and and so I thought she wasn't streaming she had a cassette and I thought sister you she said I got this tape from someone else and so that showed me that God has sent brother Dale's Ministry all over the world you see and we thank God for men like that men that love the word that are dedicated to the word that loves God's people we want to say that sister Peggy we love you and we appreciate you so much and sister Peggy right there with her husband all the time supporting him and I know that there's coming a time you've all know it that uh she'll be seeing that young man and he'll see that young lady and and how God has these things in his own economy but we thank God for sister Peggy staying there with her husband holding him up and even the last months of before God took him home her and and brother Wade and all the family sister Anna and all of you there brother Terren and all of you there uh with your dad and I thought that was love and we appreciate you doing that again brother Dale was a man that was dedicated to the word of God brother Wade took me in his office before uh brother Dale went to be with the Lord and I got to see those books and bibles and and yeah worn worn out like the colored man said from ker to ker a worn out and the ker and the ker and so we thank the Lord I wanted to say that I want to thank sister Peggy for just being the lovely lady that she is and we're we're holding you up you know they tell us real quick they tell us in the uh in the world today that loneliness it's an epidemic in this country and I thought it was beautiful brother Wade was sharing with me how that he talks to you know the widows and how are you doing what's going on with you and I'm the same way we've got three widows in the church and on Thursdays we go with sister trig there it's her uh morning we uh we have the sausage and pancakes with her and and then the other two widows there sister Charlotte who was brother Charles Lee Johnson's wife and then sister Dorothy there so we make sure to try to get them flowers every other month and and we love our widows and things and so uh if you have opportunity uh uh remember the widows here also it's it's a beautiful thing to to let them know hey you're not alone now now now I've learned over the years when it comes to loneliness you can be in a crowd of hundreds of people and still be lonely now you see but I'm thankful that we've got God a god with skin on him god with skin y'all remember the story right little boy running down down and said mother it's thundering in lightning and and I'm afraid she said you don't have to be afraid Little Johnny we're Christians everything's going to work out he said you're right mother and he went back upstairs and the lightning got stronger and he ran back down he says mother I know we're Christian family I know that and I know God is real but mother I need a god with skin and we need to be that god with skin and so we just thank the Lord for that you've heard and we want to reiterate uh what brother Wade was saying about uh the flood here the 27th of last month when the the hurricane Helen hit uh uh Tennessee there Irwin and those places and the the destruction is is unbelievable I mean I mean just pure destruction the force of water when you see water just go and Destroy very catastrophic another word that we've been used to hearing unprecedented and so these things when it hit uh Irwin it just tore everything up you may have watched or saw on the YouTube how they were evacuating the hospitals and they had a lot of helicopter coming down they the water was rushing with such a a force that it came down into the uh to Irwin there from the noichi river and anything in its path trees cars building it didn't matter it just destroyed and you have to see that destruction you can hear about it maybe you can watch it but until you really are physically there and see that kind of Devastation and see what the force of nature when it's Unleashed uh that it that it will do and so you know the hospital there in Irwin I don't even know why they built the house and in an area like that obviously you know I wouldn't have built in the flood zone but but they did and so it just destroyed the whole well I say destroyed it flooded out the whole hospital they had to get get the patients over 60 on the roof and then they had the the Blackhawk helicopters to come in and individual from the the National Guard from the different Rescue all the way from Virginia to come in or would have uh taken those lives and so you know up in the mountains I can't tell you the people who live in the mountains whether Rich it didn't discriminate if you had a cabin big house how much money you had it didn't ask it just woof and we found out that there was a reservoir that was built higher the mountain the highest mountain around there is called uh unoy Mountain but uh there was uh a a reservoir that was built over near Mount Mitchell and when they built this Reservoir to hold so much water they never believ that it would break but it but it did and when it broke it just sent water down on the North Carolina side I don't know who all have ever visited Chimney Rock before all that air Lake Lure all that that's gone and people who live there they just shade their heads there's no words to describe it and so it destroyed there's some people haven't even got power yet not just in that area I'm surprised that areas that you would never thought had lost power I even brother Burley Williams called me a couple well about a week or so week and a half ago he lives in Anderson South Carolina and he said brother we ain't have power we running generators I said you got to be kidding he said no we're not kidding we're running generators and so the the power grid that has been affected the the the tel commmunication the towers that were knocked down and and you know uh brother Wade and I he because I was coming and wanted to make some contact the the the communication our phone was not working it's now it's still spotty the communication the connection and so it tore the towers down it contaminated our water processing and all the water you had to boil it until a couple of days or so and still I mean I was going to ask him what about the rust in our pipes they they don't want to go there they don't want to go there so people are hurting and bridges I mean we used to walk across the the bridge there at a place called uncle Johnny's that's where the Appalachian tra I mean a con industrial bridge and when they told me no the bridge that goes at a place called chesto that bridge is I said no I don't believe that I got to see that you know I'm a Believer but something no I got to see that now come on now so when I went down and I saw that the whole Bridge gone gone gone I mean you could drive tractors everything across the bridge wide Bridge It just knocked that bridge and then on 107 on down the gentleman out there he's videoing and the the water just takes it he said look look here the bridge is going and so you know the devastation when you think of the flood brother Wade was sharing with me when you think of the flood that struck the andian flood how it created the Grand Canyon from that flood how it changed the course of the four rivers that came out of the Garden of Eden and and the the and the whole climate as far as that we see how the Earth was on a beautiful 78 77 degree tropical climate but when that brother brandham says when the Earth was pushed away from the Sun and created brought an ice age in and that's why even archaeologists are able to find you know Plants and Things That should be we would only see near the equator they are pulling th those things so when you think of that Mighty thing and and I don't want to hold you on this but uh you know know we are thankful for the word of Life brother Donnie Reagan and those Brothers up there they're working and sisters they're working I mean they're putting in hours to give the donations money and and the different things they know the needs of the people because they're going out they're actually going out with their four-wheel drives they're going up Mountains they're going in places where people said hey we didn't even even know that anyone knew we were up here starving to death and without water and they Mountain City going up Mountain City uh he was telling us brother Matthew was telling us that uh brother Michael and brother Michael's name last name is Bailey brother Michael and brother Michael was telling me brother Andre some of the people the only water they have is what they had in their swimming pool that's the water that they're drinking and brushing their teeth with and because even the water from the river is just so contaminated or to get down to the river so you know sometimes we think well they can just go down to the word of life or wherever and no no no you ain't got no passage to go down and and you don't want to go down it's slippery wet it's dangerous and so uh brother Mike and the those Brothers at the Word of Life they've got got it charted out they've got a command center they've got it marked the places they've been and they also have you know they've taken tax and and now they're putting all this information on their uh on their spreadsheets and things like that to know who is receiving this who's receiving that what did they receive did we get a call back from them etc etc and so when you begin to now in 199 three I worked with the Salvation Army and I wor I was the disaster relief in maretta Georgia they sent me down to Dade County and I worked Hurricane Andrew I was there a couple of weeks and so I know a little bit I worked with FEMA you know I ain't saying nothing negative on anybody I work with the Red Cross ain't something nothing negative about them but thank God I got to work with the Salvation Army and so yeah that's a great organization Salvation Army they they helping people so I only said that to say some of those agencies like FEMA we've got sister at at the church there sister Caroline her mother's house her mother's her sister her niece their homes were swept in the river the water came down rose up and just took them off their foundations so by the Grace of the Lord the church back home we're working with those three families to to say hey we're with you to totally we're not going to abandon you and so we thought well we'll get the governor of Tennessee he's a good Governor there Bill Lee he came by and he saw the destruction what happened he couldn't believe it and so the people were asking what about FEMA FEMA is the Federal Emergency Man uh management association and FEMA they told the people there we don't have any money you mean one of the second worst national natural disaster in the United States and you don't have any money what happened to all those billions y'all are lated every year by the the Congress and well they said they ain't up here to accuse anyone but when you see how people are hurt and so I again I'd like to reiterate as what it's easier logistical to send money the money's going to the Word of Life Church brother Mike and I was sitting in the office just a moment ago with my my notes and things brother Wade laid a check down there I know he want send the check when I saw the amount of it the amount of I was like wow man that's beautiful he wrote a check out for $1,000 from your church here and so I've got that to take to brother Mike there brother Mike Bailey and give it to them and uh told Brother Wade I'm going to have brother Mike to call him and to you know I know brother Mike's going to thank him and then ask him uh brother Michael share what other needs and how they're working to to do those things and so if if you're thinking about going up which I don't think it it's better to send money right it it's it's it is more wisdom because that way they can take that money and they know how to appropriate it where it's supposed to go what supplies and you may have things and you know like they said you can get online there and you can order something by prime or anything have it sent there so now with people coming in sometimes because they want to try to accommodate you and things like that and they got their hands full already hands full it's like brother thank you all for coming thank you for being here but next time uh if you'll send money it's easier and and and you just talked to Mike on those things and so you know when I went up there and I saw we're just uh we're down the road in Irwin there in Johnson City and I thought well with some of my experience of working with FEMA if that counted for anything I mean not just fem I'm a wildland firefighter also fight fires in the mountains I'm I'm uh I went to school for that at ETSU and so uh you know when you see that kind of coordination their coordination is better than any other uh organizations that's there for all kind of reasons when you see the suffering of people sometimes y I know this might be hard to believe but sometimes people take advantage of people and so how we thank the Lord when somebody asked me the other day what about the group up a Word of Life I said brother you dealing with the hand of God now ain't nobody trying to take nothing from you if these people come to you that's like that's God coming to you so you thank God if you you know if they call you or say hey so do that pray for them uh the they have the fellowship hall it's humongous they've got things staged all over and the people are coming in but it's not listen now it's not the people coming in because 90% of the people can't come in right so they've got it coordinated in the evening and afternoons that different Brothers they go different places and they deliver the supplies so it's not them you know saying okay y'all come y'all come now they're going to the highways and the byways and all these places to deliver those things so it's when I told my wife how beautiful it is the bride of Christ doesn't matter where she's at who she is uh she's always interested in the well-being of people and so y'all get together well I can't tell you that I don't even tell the church back home but you know pray for them contact them see what you can help them in because it's a blessing when I say them I mean the people that are real really really hurting and so God bless you for listening to us we just wanted to share that with you our church we're behind it 100% whatever we can do y'all are behind it other churches are behind it I see y'all got Brother Bear Coffee y'all donating that way also so God richly bless you if you do send something pray say Lord this is much but Lord take this little take this uh father Loaves and two fish and make it a blessing and God can do that right we know that we know our Bible right y'all read the same Bible I do right okay good and you know Jesus can multiply he just start praying gave to the ministry and then they start handing out and so you might have whatever you got to share and say Lord I want to be a part of that Lord and you do that so God richly bless you and so we're just going to just take take a few more uh moments this morning and let's just uh cuz y'all look like you're tired of sitting let's all stand let the musicians come back is it all right F musici musicians y'all come back don't don't sister Esther look like Andre I was sit beside my

the word of God in one more time word of God ever true it's changing me changing you we have come with open heart oh let the word of God one more time let's just bow our head kind and gracious Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are to being gathered around your word and hearing from you Lord knowing the day that you've called us in this hour Lord we ask Lord that the supernatural strength that comes with the word the power of transformation that transforms us Lord have your way speak to us by Divine re Revelation you said on this rock I'll build my church something real something true father if ever we needed reality it's now and it's you have your way in Jesus name we pray bless our BR Pastor here brother Wade Lord the fine job that he has Lord and father I can't tell the people what comes with this great responsibility it's not something I would tell anyone you should be this you should be a pastor you should be this no Lord father these calls and callings are have so much Lord so much Lord that we want to be stewards of your word father and Lord we want to have the discernment and the wisdom of the Holy Ghost because this is your people Lord Blood Bought people Lord be glorified Lord have your way in Jesus name father if there be any sick here whatever confused or say brother Andre I'm going through S circumstance situation God you specialize in things thought to be impossible and Lord we are believers Lord and we believe your word father open up your word to our hearts Lord and we'll give you glory for your wordy in Jesus name we pray amen if you have your Bibles let's turn over to Isaiah 59 so brother Andre we thought you was finished preaching one preaching Isaiah 59 thank you musicians God bless you all we've been speaking a while on Redemption and we've been reading that wonderful message brother brandham talked about the kinsman's Redeemer talking about Ruth and four stages that there Ruth deciding when you begin to get into those messages brother Brian says now Ruth it's a lovely story but it's more than a love story you see it's it's a history but it's more than a history you see and so when we begin to see Redemption and Ruth the kinsman's Redeemer and we thank God that we had a prophet that was a typologist brother Brian he didn't lean on education and those things God showed him types and shadows and so he brought those things to us even when you begin to look at the ministry of Our Lord in the days of his flesh the Bible says that he spoke in Parable and without a parable he did not teach them you see so how thankful that when we see these types and shadows if it's a shadow before it can be a shadow light has to strike the object you cannot have I'm not going to keep standing but you cannot have a a negative without a positive brother brandham says here in this 16 element body this is the negative but because what has happened to your heart the reality of God has brought you to a New Birth then somewhere there is a positive and we're only reflecting right that here in this Dimension just like the stars and the sun when God created them in Genesis there the the Stars the planets they have not their own light they are reflecting light the Seven Stars that Jesus had in his right hand they did not have their own light they were reflecting the light of the Sun and we're thankful to God that we have become that light not the fourth person I told somebody I ain't the fourth person in the Trinity no no but reflecting something someone's watching you influence someone is watching you and seeing what you're doing and and you're reflecting something but as a Christian you're reflecting God Jesus said and when he was speaking the parables in Matthew Chapter 5 he said you are the salt of the earth and if salt loses SA what good is it it preserves also Jesus goes on and says now ye are the light of the world and so we're thankful that that light that's in our heart because God has three Thrones right right Spirit throne in Jesus Christ in the bride and in in your heart he has a throne reflecting that great light and so how thankful we are for those things in Isaiah are y'all there 59 verse 19 I gave you a little time to get there and we'll start here Isaiah 59 and we'll start at verse 19 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West that's the setting of the Sun the going down and His glory from the rising of the Sun the East when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against it and the Redeemer oh my shall come to Zion now when we look at Zion and and Jerusalem and New Jerusalem there's a spiritual Zion and there's a natural Zion there's a creation that's the New Jerusalem and then we have the natural Jerusalem that New Jerusalem that city is where MDC came came from the Heavenly Jerusalem Paul says that when he speaks in Hebrews so you and I are part of Zion and the New Jerusalem all these compound meanings you see this is where God wants to dwell God wants to dwell in Zion you see God wants to dwell in his people that's his City you see so he says here and the Redeemer the kinsman's Redeemer shall come to Zion andto that uh and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this is my Covenant this is a covenant that he gave with Abraham that's our covenant you see and this in Genesis 15 you know those things as for me this is my Covenant with them sayth the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed not seed seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the Lord from henceforth and forever arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and the Kings to the brightness of thy Rising may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his holy and precious word you may be seated how thankful we are in this hour that the the word of God it becomes personalized to us as you know God deals with Israel as a nation right but when he deals with the G Gentiles that's us he deals with us as individuals amen God deals that way he's a god of variety I remember when we were out west and Brother Joseph and his beloved wife they were getting married and I didn't have a shirt or something I W married then there you okay I wouldn't say that I didn't have no shirt or something in my wife here now good good so I didn't have a shirt to wear to the wedding and we went to the JC Pennies out there in in New Mexico and so the I told the woman this ma'am this is what I need here and she said okay well about that time a guy he he walked up beside me he was taller than Michael and and I mean he was he was stretched and when she came back out here I am here he is here I am like brother Dale used to call Joseph mutton Jeff see ye and yang and when she came out she did one of these numbers and there was another guy standing out he said well that proves that God is a god of variety he is a god of variety and so many things and plants and flowers and mountains and things like that sometimes we have God in a box and we can't see the the big picture you see even though God wants us to see the big picture because God loves to be revealed he loves to show his great Majesty see Jesus said in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go and prepare a place for you amen when we begin to look at these scriptures here and there's no way I mean that we could even justify just trying to share a half of scripture how rich is the word of God it just continues to unfold and it continues to unfold in our life as God leads us and guides us and and as we begin to follow the lord he begins to put questions in our heart listen now not questions in our minds because how many questions after questions after questions that we have in our mind see but when God comes listen to me now and he begins to place in our mind a question he's drawing us to himself right he is creating the desire that's it amen see now I'm not talking about theology I got enough theology books at home come on brother I'm not trying to bring homic to you I know that too right but we're talking reality somebody has met God God has spoken to someone doesn't matter how many people say I'm in the message and this God has chosen an elected bride somebody is The Offspring of God and God ain't in heaven doing this oh please come oh please come no man Jesus said can come to me except my father draws him and those at my father draw him I will in no wise cast out you see so there is an elected people in the Earth today yes sir who are being led by the Holy Spirit see they're not leading God God's leading them sometimes people think they're leading God right sometimes we get in our powwows and we think you know that's a good idea that's right uhhuh I believe yeah that's right but that's not how God does it though you see when he the Holy Spirit has come yes brother brandom tells us this story that there was a boy a little boy and he went to his mother and said mother has anyone ever seen God true story and she said well Sunny go ask the Sunday school teacher and he went to the Sunday school teacher this was a question that God placed in his heart why are you saying that because if God is really drawing you if he's really drawing you he knows how to lead you he knows how to place things in your heart that draws you to him if I be lifted up I will draw men unto me amen and so the boy he went to his sonay school teacher said I mean his son sco teach said has anyone ever seen God she said well that you know Junior that's a good question go and ask the pastor so Junior went to the pastor he said pastor I asked my mom she couldn't answer I went to Sunday school teach can answer he said what's what's going on he said I want to know has anyone ever seen God he said oh boy you know the Bible said no man can see God and live can't nobody see can't see God listen if the boy just would have been curious he would have just said okay well that's good Pastor said that's but this was more than curiosity this was God on the scene this was the same God said Adam Where Art Thou Where Art Thou Adam right brother he said I was afraid who told you afraid where did fear come into our relationship I was afraid and so I hid myself because I was naked who told you that you was naked like like God didn't know that what about the young people you say Mom and Daddy they don't know but God knows and God cares he and so that if there's a a broad body in the earth and they are sir then Jesus taught us in Matthew chapter 7 how to make righteous judgments and we don't come down and condemn the whole world to hell because they don't no no no no we make righteous judgments amen the Apostle Paul said in Corinthians chapter six know ye not that ye shall judge the world and these little matters you're tripping on don't you know you're going to Jud this Bible verse you're going to Jo judge the Angels let's just go over there too I think it's 1 Corinthians chapter 6 if it's not it's 1 Corinthians 7 let's go to 1 Corinthians I love the word of God I love in the church I'm always encouraging them we've got uh 16 going on 15 16 people who read the Bible through last year we have their names up we also we started the bereans the bereans are from Acts chapter 17 where the Bible says that when Apostle Paul left thessalonica went to Berea the Bible says they were more Nobles because they searched out the word with joy so now we're we're we're putting a the bereans list at the church I think brother Jarry Peterson he's at number three third time reading the Bible but it's more than that there's more challenges to that and and so we want to always encourage everyone read your Bible uh We've uh shared with uh the people at church on William tendle my hero there yes sir when the the the bishop visited where William tendle he spoke seven language fluent and he was tutoring a family and the bishop visited and the discussion you can just Google it up and pull it up the the bishop said to William tendle the pope he knows this and that and William tendle said that you see that boy plowing the fields he probably know more than the Pope the bishop probably went crosy yeah you mean he knows more than the P than the pontiff yeah and William tendle said if God will give me the strength I will interpret the Bible that even the plow boy that's out there will be able to read the Bible and then we just throw our Bible down don't read it half the time ain't got time to read it come on now William Tinder was burned at the Stak for printing the Bible in English he spoke English too and as they were burning him at the Stak took wires because they wanted to decapitate him and the boys those young 17 18 19 year old boys who would hide the Bible in a flower in a sack of flour and take it out they caught those boys and burnt those boys so that you come on now can have a Bible think about it that means something to someone right amen that means something to someone so we see here in in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse one dare any of you having matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints do you not know that the saint shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you man he bring it down on Apostle Paul if the world uh and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matter we talking about the bride everybody going in a Rapture everybody but look at these responsibilities know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life why don't you go with me to Matthew chapter 7 this ain't even in my notes I don't even know but I want to follow the leadership of the holy spirit amen them notes don't mean nothing it's what the Lord wants is what we want and Matthew Chapter 5 I'm sorry Matthew chapter 7 judge not that ye be not judged now you you have to Trail some of these words because when he's saying judge he's saying don't be condemning somebody to Hell see don't do that if you haven't walked in their shoes if you don't know their circumstances see and because we are the second fold of the threefold and we have the mind of christu the way that we judge and the way that we bring God's word will be no different than how Jesus handled the situation amen true brother so we're making righteous judgments understanding the word because we are becoming the word the full word am right see believe that and because we are the light of the world because we are the word made manifest because the Bride is a son of man in this last day because the bride is the word made flesh in the beginning was the word then is there someone in the Earth with the mind of God that would do the same thing that Jesus at the first fold done will the second fold do the same that's right yes absolutely brother you are that's right so Jesus says here Matthew 7 judge not not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye meet ye shall uh be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but consider not the being that is in thine own eye Jesus goes on to give us understanding and wisdom as Sons and Daughters of the Living God because that's who we are so we see the boy his Pastor said Son you the Bible says no one can see God and and live okay thank you Pastor well if that would have just been a question as we said someone presented to him then he would have just said well you know he would have told his buddies man no one can see God of course we know what the scripture says regarding that that no one can see God and live but the question that God placed in his heart amen was the question that only listen now if God placed it in his heart only God could answer that question if God has placed this message in your heart there has to be a people with the evening time results to meet the challenge of this hour and that's you my brother and sister in the Simplicity believe that that's what you're doing amen and you know the rest of the story was the boy satisfied would you be satisfied no he was not satisfied and so there he was down at the river and an Old Gentleman there had his boat there and he uh uh he said to the the old chap said sir do you mind if I ride in your boat with you he said no fell you don't think your folks would mind hop aboard and so the boy he watched the the man and a storm had just ended the leaves floating on the river the freshness amen through the air a rainbow had come up the Sun was shining CLS were moving off and the boy was watching his dad I mean the old man with the ore and he said sir I've got a question he said speak up sonny boy he said sir I went to my mother and I asked her mama has anyone ever seen God go to your Sunday school teacher I went to Sunday school teacher go to the pastor I went to the pastor let let let me paraphrase that even a little more and now I'm talking to you sir has anyone ever seen God before brother brandham said tears begin to flow out the old man's eyes his lips began to kind of quiver there he said Son you see that rainbow he said yes he said that's God he said you see that son there he said yes sir he says that's God and this River and freshness he said yes sir he said it takes God to live in you for you to seek God out here right but when he's in you then everywhere he says sunny boy I've been a Christian many years and that's all that I do see is God he didn't say only thing I see is the church he said that's all I do see is God if God listen now again if God places a desire and a hunger amen and a question in your heart sir he's the only one that's right that can answer that question he's the only one that can make the word a reality you see in the message trying to do God a service brother brandham says and today he's standing amongst us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more coming into his church making himself known because him and the bride the groom will be the same making himself known and one day you'll see that one that you feel in your heart and see his identification will become personalized before you then you and he are one you've United with the word and the Word was in the beginning will uh in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God and that day you'll know that I'm in my father the father in me I in you and you in me Hallelujah brother Brown says hallelujah we're here hallelujah I'm so glad to see him personifying himself right amongst us and see what he promised for the word not not what somebody's emotion not somebody singing or jumping or dancing but his word he's making himself known by his word you see how thankful we are for that that God has called his bride like this and when we begin to look at Ruth and we begin to look at the broad types in the scripture we see that all of those broad types had to make a decision God placed them in sometimes in the world a predestination or Providence they used to call it long time ago God would be leading and they didn't know he was leading and I'll say this unequivocally if you a bride member you've been born again God knew you before the foundation of the world and it was not the person that come predestinated but the word as God opened himself up you find yourself in the very economy of God because it's not you it's him am God has done these things for his own purpose he created everything for its purpose let's go to Revelations chapter 4 real quick and and uh just a few oh wow just a few more minutes and we close I didn't I didn't even realize Revelation chapter 4 verse n and when those those Beast it should be living creatures brother Brown says Revelations 4:9 and when those Beast the lion yeah the ox the face of a man and the Flying Eagle amen as brother brownan said in each age in those ages when the anointing of the living creatures coming out of the word the briad in each age she could do no more that's right than the anointing that was upon her to do abely and that's why when irus there went down to give his life and a voice said be a man be a man he wasn't afraid because the anointing right amen of the ARX was upon him to give his life and when they went down to the Roman Coliseum and it was dark and the and the the fire that was uh uh Illuminating the Coliseum was the hair of Christian women that they cut their hair off put it on the steak and burnt their hair to light the Coliseum go back and see if I'm telling you the truth and we cut our hair like it ain't nothing a woman's hair that's her glory and they set their hair on fire even even the Roman historian I'm not talking about the Jewish historian right but the Roman historian I can't recall his name but just look it up he will tell you that they took those Christian women cut their hair y right and put it on the Stak put it on the torch to light the Coliseum so they could kill the rest of the Christians and going down because they had got there too late they didn't have to drag irus even before they came to get him he fed them right how could they do anything else than the anointing that was leading them to do see so we see in the scriptures that brother random says I think in the third s I'm not sure he says that the anointing those that came under he said not that you are a special people but because the anointing of God has been released upon you through the word how can you do anything contrary to the word you you don't want to do anything contrary to the word so under this fourth living creature under the eagle anointing the Flying Eagle anointing how can we do anything else but fly and have faith brother Aon brought it out at the church up there and that eagle brother brandham had his rifle brother Bram said look I don't you know I'll shoot you and the eagle just looking at brother Brown brother Brown tells the story The Eagle just looking at him saying go ahead try it because the eagle had faith and his god-given gifts amen Them Wings amen what you got faith in come on brother what you got faith in you said brother Andre I got faith in that Holy Ghost amen that lives in my heart let me let me just let me just read this so how thankful we are to God as the Bible says and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever the four and 20 Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast down their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things amen and for thy pleasure brother y for thy pleasure not for anyone else thou has created all things amen see for thou H has created all things and for thy place treasure they are and were created this is a sovereign God who does as he pleases amen he raises up kingdoms he changes times right because God is God you see amen now now let's let's run back here to Isaiah 60 and let's close on that Isaiah chapter 60 Redemption yes sir when the Redeemer comes now we don't have time and we and I ain't going to make time because I don't like to rush myself and I'm I'm starting to rush but the Bible says and the Redeemer shall come to Zion right we're going to see in the Book of Ruth God Boaz drawing Ruth and also getting drawing Naomi and also getting Ruth we see when the angel of the Lord came to brother Bram in 1946 for the ministry of the word and told him that Israel was being draw back to be a nation we see Israel in our homeland today and maybe there's still others that's scattered that God is bringing because God doesn't deal with Israel out of her Homeland that's right you see bringing them so we ask oursel why is the hatred of the whole world against the Jews why are those so why are those so hated when they didn't understand themselves being blind and said his blood be upon us and our children and it's been on it ever since amen and we see that happening today amen but there is an Awakening come on now that's happening to the Jews because the spirit of Elijah is returning Amen to Israel amen so if the spirit of Elijah is returning to Israel listen we are commanded in Psalms 122 to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem you know he doesn't tell us how you should pray like this no he just said pray for the Peace of Jerusalem amen because God knows what he's doing amen and Israel they don't need the hatred of the United Nations right or all these countries see because He Who Watches Over Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep amen right The Sovereign God he don't care how much they say we're going to vote Benjamin nanahu we're going to vote you out God don't care about that that's right HJ all things were created by Him and for him right so we see God bringing Israel yes back to the Homeland and we see 144,000 that's going to receive the word and we understand under the fifth trumpet 200,000,000 Devils there from Euphrates have been let loose and we see because of the opening of the seals the spirit of Truth has been released upon the broad amen amen God bless you this evening y'all love the Lord am amen let's just bow our head Heavenly Father we love you because you first loved us we thank you for the message of the hour that's calling us

see this lovely bride here at Lula and see the Harvest that uh the seed word that was planted and ministered and taught and then Lord you are in charge of your ministry Ephesians 4 said you gave some and Lord you have brother Wade here the pastor Lord pointing this people to you having them to recognize their day and its message having them to recognize that when this brother brandham said I in the message Shalom preached in 1964 he read the scripture there when he was either at uh Sierra Vista or at Phoenix and he read it and he said this is an end time prophecy to an end time people so Lord when the scripture says arise shine yeah Lord that has there has to be an individual in this congregation that could rise up and say oh he's speaking to me yes amen he he he's telling me to rise and shine for thy light is come but Lord Isaiah 61 could not come into view right unless the Redeemer comes to Zion he has come he has paid the price and we're thankful that we're sitting under the true atonement of the word for this hour be glorified Lord in each and every heart here doesn't matter who we are may we just yield to you Lord if we're young say Lord there's many things I don't understand but I know that you love me and I love you Lord and Lord I want you to fill me with your Holy Spirit if there be any that don't have that Holy Spirit may they ask Lord please give me your

out of the way and let God use him and uh how much did we uh how much did $2,100 thank you so very much that's a bunch of 20s there have been some 50s and and hundreds in there too I think if you have anything else though please give it to them we're going to give some to from the church and get them started and I think we'll probably do this first Sunday of every month we'll just give all the offering to them to the to the vision books cuz I like I said before best bang for the buck to get this message to people and as I've always told you brother Andre and I were talking when we get to Glory all things are going to be made known right right we're not going to have any barriers in our in our minds we're we're going to be we're going to be uh fully aware of everything and it's all going to be good and somebody's going to walk up to you one day and say the Lord told me that you gave $10 on a certain certain day and that $10 bought 10 books and one of them books got in my hand and I read this great message and I started going to church and got filled with the Holy Ghost if it hadn't been for you I may not have ever got that book may not have ever just some small 8 cent book is worth as Louise says 10,000 and brother says 10,000 worlds for 8 cents you're giving somebody the words of eternal life so we sure appreciate what you give and like I said before every every first Sunday of every month we'll give that not that amount whatever we get in that's what we'll get all right so um uh thank you so much thank you so much and we're going to give also some relief funds to brother Barry Coffey uh we'll get with ter him after the service but remember brother Andre now they're going to have to travel back here after the service is over and get back so they can uh they can do some groundwork cuz they know the place uh if you ever been up there it's the most beautiful Valley in the world it's just beautiful and now it ain't beautiful it's it's pretty much gone and some of those places uh I saw today this morning where at least 80% of the people that got their homes destroyed had zero flood insurance never thought they'd ever need flood insurance so they don't take they didn't take out blood insurance 80% of the people lost their homes lost their businesses and they're not going to get a dime for it they're going to have to start from scratch and they've lost it all so but we know a God that can just give it all back like brother Andre said wonderful wonderful analogy we got a God that's that that divides and multiplies and it don't bother him one bit if he's only got Five Loaves and two fishes he fed 5,000 people with it didn't bother him he didn't get nervous he didn't start going now if I do this and I'll get this no he just said here go give this out what a mighty God we serve uh let's go into our uh communion scripture uh as I said always this is an open communion you take communion as your heart gives you the desire um and and I want to admonish each and every one of us we'll never be worthy enough to take communion if we keep listening to our own thinking exactly like brother Andre said if we start keep Satan keeps poking these things in our head but what you got to do is you got to be clear in your heart that I've done all I can do I've walked in here I've I've I've asked God to clean me up and if there is anything go get it right go make it right but this communion is important to me amen communion keeps us clean it keeps us checked up so so don't feel if you feel unworthy you're the only one that knows what's going on in your head but listen to your heart what God tells you God tells you to do these ordinances until he comes that's right all right so Christians will take communion right period there's no Christian that won't take communion I've never seen one and like brother Ram said they asked him one time said brother Ram said does a Christian pay ties he said Christians only Christians are going to pay you know real true tithe he said but a Christian will pay tithe so a Christian will take Comm communion so let's go to the communion scripture which is first Corinthians I love it how that Paul wasn't there but he had so much Clarity the Holy Ghost gave him Clarity U brother Andre just like he a vision and and there was no other you know there was 11 or so ever how many people up there in the upper room and and they might have had 11 different opinions that's okay God said I'm going to move that out of the way and I'm going to have a Prophet come and I'm going to have that Prophet tell you exactly what happened and it be no other man's opinions because he said for I have received of the Lord all right so we know right there where it came from it didn't come from here say it didn't come from Peter Cuz Peter could have missed something that's right he said I have received from the Lord that which also I delivered unto you so he didn't keep it secret he gave it to us that the same night in which he was betray Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stck saying this cup is the New Testament there had to be the death of a testator right for that Testament to be in force and when this Testament comes in force it's not the blood of bulls and goats anymore it's the blood of the perfect lamb it's the blood of a man that can take his life and come right back inside of you and make you a different person blood bulls and goats can't do that animal blood can't do that God's blood sir God's life God I'm not going to start preaching God's blood God's life all right remember I told yall the other day you apply the token you apply that over your house over your children Satan cannot reach through that blood cannot ever even I mean if he even touches it's like 10 billion bolts and he's like oh I better not touch that no more right if we believe that that's why we apply the token that's why we apply we don't apply the blood of bulls and ghosts we apply the blood of God the blood of Jesus Christ all right here we go after the same manner he took the cup and we up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remance of me if you don't take this communion and not remember Jesus and what he did and all the things that he had to go through just for me and you then you're missing something we need to enter into what they're entered in with and listen they didn't understand at that time right I mean they're still asking him are you going to restore the kingdom even after he raised from the dead but you and I have a revelation that that's what we're supposed to do until God comes from him to us that's right so you can say in your heart I have received of the Lord this scripture that we're talking about I have received from the Lord right for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord if he would have stopped right there yeah you probably wouldn't take communion all the time but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup let a man examine himself for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are we and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves to go back to what brother Andre was talking about we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with this world separated wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will I set in order in other words Paul's coming back in 2 Corinthians he's coming back to set some other things in order but he set this in order the way it should been I believe it's the way it's been done for 2,000 years I believe it and I believe we're going to do it until we until we drink with him in the in the um not in the new city we're going to do it at the marriage supper yes sir we're going to do it up atast three and a half years we're going to have communion just like we do now but today for those of you that never taken communion in this building before remember one thing's for sure that bread has been made with holy hands that bread has not been processed by the world Amen that wine has been made with one thing in mind and that's to have communion that it be wine and not grape juice grape juice will rot it has a expiration date on it well if the Wine's done right it never does have an expiration date on it it just keeps getting better and better and better so um with that we're going to take our communion and the Lord he took the bread and he put it in his hands and he blessed it and he said Lord he said oh father thank you so much for this opportunity Lord that we have Lord as we see him standing in the upper room knowing that one was going to betray him knew the whole world was going to be against him and his body was going to be as a prophet said hamburger meat in just a few hours but Lord he you did it for us yes and father as we break this bread may we remember you Lord and remember what you went through that time Lord but what a glorious time we're going to have when we take this with you and look you straight in the eye and say have you had you not come we would not be here father just sanctify this bread in Jesus name amen this bread will be taken and soon as we're finished with it brother Ryan I used to do it all the time brother Ryan's now uh our designated Deacon to do that and he's going to take it he's going to burn it beyond recognition where it's not going we're going to get new revelation next time we take communion we taking new bread right that old leftover Revelation in the uh Wilderness Journey other RS called it just like a southerner would call it wiggle tail yes but for those of you that are not Southern that means it had worms in it and it was not edible because it was held over but we don't hold this over this will be completely burnt to a crisp there be nothing left or held over sure appreciate all of you coming today um we appreciate brother Andre coming down through the having to come almost around the world get here to uh be with us and like I said before let's just pray that that even the the dot Department of Transportation will all have a a good you know it won't take a year if they say it take a year let's just pray that it's 6 months cuz they got to put it together I mean we're living in this world God can do it yeah he can just he can turn this whole thing around but that's not the way the world's running we got to run by faith now so let's believe that they're going to have a good time putting it back together and all the people going to get their stuff back and we sure you know what so I don't know no brother that was PR well we serve a god of Miracles cuz it take a miracle to do that so we're going to believe in a god of Miracle heavenly father thank you for this wine Lord that gets better Lord with age yes Lord I pray that you'd sanctify Lord our people father may they be blessed today father as we as we partake of this communion father may we then remember the blood that was shed at Calvary yes that Lord could come back and take a Believer and take him from a sinner to a saint yes father thank you so much for this opportunity to stand in front of your purchased possession and to have our brother with us and his wife father I pray that you'd be with them too and sanctify them give them strength in their Journey there in Irwin Lord with the people Lord that you'll ever give them a blessing in Jesus name Jesus amen come morning I walk by the river how rest the ever green tree oh what a peaceful time I'll carry my cross through the midnight this is the midnight time now but come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised we can all relate to that right and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and what does it do it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the river that's a peaceful song how we never have to worry about a flood anymore we never have to worry about water destroying our home never have to worry about tornadoes hurricanes all the things that happen on this side never have to worry about that again they'll be no fear morning there's glory for me sometimes I despised and rejected and I question oh Father how listen folks it was not going to be long not going to be long not going to be long at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to you know I was thinking the other day we were watching what was going on in the Israel and just thinking because you know we we already got the news we don't have to turn on CNN or Fox we do to get what's going on but we know what's going to happen we know the whole world is going to reject Israel All America says yeah we'll back them and this one says yeah we'll back them and until they make America mad but I like what brother Benton brother n Yahoo said he said we didn't ask for your help that's right exactly that's right we don't need it that's right but it's good I appreciate you coming and helping but we never ask for your help I don't think there's ever been a phone call that went from Israel to America it's always Israel going America going you need some help you know and they'll take the help cuz we give them their technology they give them our techn uh their technology too so we work together but there's going to come a day when Every Nation on the face of this Earth is going to be heading toward that little ever how many square miles that little thing is not much bigger than Massachusetts what about that they they ain't the whole world wanting Massachusetts no one offense to Massachusetts but the land mass it's not huge it's very small compared to the world and you're talking about um bringing them home and they won't be blessed till they're in the home right you you know they're soon they're going to call everybody back in when they get into a big hard fight and they start losing people they're going to call those people from there's there's Millions live in America that are Jewish citizens that are obligated according to their uh to their army to go fight for the Homeland now wouldn't you and me if we were over in Italy or somewhere and and we were getting bombed over here we'd come back here especially Israel cuz see they know they're God's people and they know that God's going to protect them yes sir but one day folks that's not going to happen the whole world's going to Encompass that City and then God's going to fight but you and I are not going to be around that's right we're not going to see that if you see some of this coming up that's just a that's just a pressure cooker to what's coming sure America will help you know why America is helping Israel cuz we're still here exactly right that's right God is letting this thing go because you and I are not ready yet but when we get ready and he flips that switch from Gentiles to Jews yes Katie Bar the Door the old saying is that's when all hell is going to break loose this is nothing compared to what's coming right so get in Christ as I said last week get under some wings get under some feathers forget about trying to make it through the tribulation sorry ain't going to happen but we love the Lord and we love that God's give us this information you know what it's called Revelation it's called Eagles view that you can see we can see we know what's going to happen when we get out of here we know what's going to happen and we know what's going to happen as it leads up to it so let's just pray for those people though they're humans pray for those people in North Carolina Tennessee Virginia all the different on they're human beings that have human lives and we never want to neglect human lives cuz we're all we all off same tree that's right amen but listen you thank God that he saved your soul lord and if you hadn't saved your soul thank God he's G you time to say get your soul saved that's right you ask God to help you yes let's take God bless you while they're taking it up I'll read the scripture for the foot washing the supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and wipped him with a towel where with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said Lord Dost thou wash my feet now I was thinking about when what you said that question was not from Peter that that question came from God CU God's fixing to answer that he's fixing to answer that question right so Peter says do you wash my feet and then what what did Jesus say Jesus answered said unto him what I do thou knowest not now Peter you're going to you're going to complain about this right now but you're going to know when I leave you're going to know what to do right what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me and Peter he dove in and so not not only my hands and my feet but everything my head everything watch me watch me Lord cuz you know what he he didn't want to be he didn't want to be away from from this man they called Jesus he said you'll have no part with me Peter if you don't do this in other words I'll be separated from you Peter said no Lord don't separate from me wash everything I got wash us all Jesus said he that is washed neth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment was sit down he said unto them know you what I've done to you question and this is God asking the question and he's fixing to give him a go a God answer you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am I was thinking about this the other day while they're getting ready I think about this the other day that was many times they called him master and Lord and he said no don't don't worship me worship the father don't wor but when he comes to this right here he said you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am now look though if I then because he put himself in a position but he he didn't put himself in a position up here he said now if I then your lord and my have washed your feet you also are to wash one another's feet right brought it right back down right here for I have given you an example amen right right given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord all right brought it right there to equal neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things sad are ye if you do them oh no it
