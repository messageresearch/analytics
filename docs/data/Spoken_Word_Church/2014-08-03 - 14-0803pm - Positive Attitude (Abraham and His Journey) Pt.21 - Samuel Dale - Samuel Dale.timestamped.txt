[30:52] Hebrews
[30:54] 11 let's talk about Abraham and his
[30:57] journey all right Heavenly Father we
[30:59] thank you this day that you have given
[31:02] us an opportunity to be able to come
[31:05] together to be able to hear because it
[31:08] could be taken from us at any given
[31:10] moment that we would not be able
[31:12] together and that we would not be able
[31:14] to communicate with one another as far
[31:17] as man knows but we know in that hour
[31:20] and time it'll all be taken care of and
[31:22] we're not concerned about it we're just
[31:25] concerned with one thing getting ready
[31:28] against that day so help us Lord to see
[31:32] who we are because only those in that
[31:34] day that have as we've been trying to
[31:36] say for quite a while a positive
[31:38] attitude are going to be able to
[31:41] withstand the enemy in his ways and his
[31:44] doings because we must be programmed to
[31:47] know for shity and you're not left us
[31:50] blind you've given us the truth to be
[31:52] able to walk therein we love you and we
[31:55] thank you Father guide us now as we
[31:57] speak about you and your loving grace in
[32:00] Jesus name amen amen hallelujah Hebrews
[32:04] 11 we'll go verse 1 and two and then
[32:07] we'll go to verse
[32:11] 8-10 now Faith is a substance of things
[32:13] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[32:15] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[32:19] good report so what do we doing we are
[32:22] taking the report or the testimony or
[32:25] the witness that they have given
[32:27] that God is
[32:31] real he's a
[32:33] reality he's not an imagination he's not
[32:36] a thought he's an actual substance amen
[32:40] he is the substance okay now let's go to
[32:43] verse eight by faith
[32:46] Abraham when he was called to go out
[32:49] into a place which he should have to
[32:50] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[32:53] went out not knowing whether he went by
[32:56] faith he sojourn in the land of promise
[32:58] as in a strange country dwelling in the
[33:01] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[33:03] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[33:07] he looked for a city whose Builder City
[33:10] who has foundations whose Builder and
[33:13] maker is God you may be seated Lord add
[33:17] his Blessing to the reading of the
[33:21] word now still talking about faith
[33:25] substance faith
[33:28] not an imagination or a thought
[33:30] substance Faith a
[33:34] revelation that we can walk
[33:38] in and that will carry us
[33:40] through all right so we were talking
[33:44] about this morning you know we read that
[33:46] Enoch walked with God and we was not
[33:49] because God took him but now we read
[33:50] this morning the Bible says there in
[33:52] Genesis 6 and9 I believe it was was
[33:55] talking about Noah
[33:57] and how that Noah walked with God and I
[34:01] gave some examples down through the
[34:03] Bible of David and the different ones
[34:06] who walked with
[34:08] God because they had a testimony that
[34:12] they pleased him all right and he was
[34:14] pleased to dwell in
[34:16] them all right and then it came down as
[34:20] we use the last part just talking about
[34:23] it that he's pleased to dwell in you
[34:27] he's pleased to honor your
[34:30] word the prophet said what is your
[34:34] decision you know what is your thought
[34:37] what is your decision all right then
[34:40] it's coming to a personal revelation is
[34:43] the point I'm trying to make because
[34:45] those with a personal revelation were
[34:47] the those who had mounted to you know
[34:50] were the ones that amounted to anything
[34:52] in the Bible
[34:54] times those who really had a contact
[34:56] with God who saw God believed God walked
[35:00] with
[35:01] God you know in all of their testimonies
[35:04] all of their report as Paul said here
[35:08] speaks of Hebrews
[35:12] 138 and no matter what age what time
[35:15] what we are he's the same yesterday
[35:17] today and
[35:20] forever now we come up to Abraham and
[35:23] you know I hope you listened if you
[35:25] hadn't heard it message Wade brought the
[35:28] other Wednesday on
[35:30] Abraham and I thought it was a a
[35:32] wonderful
[35:34] message how that he started out as Abram
[35:38] right and made his journey into the name
[35:41] of Abraham and that's what we were doing
[35:43] last night a little bit in the Bible
[35:45] study we had a real good time at least I
[35:48] did of talking about these things and uh
[35:52] you know and looking at Abram a r a m
[35:56] Abram
[35:57] and his name was changed to
[35:59] Abraham so he actually what did he add
[36:03] he added an
[36:05] ha and brother R said he gave him part
[36:08] of his
[36:09] name you go back in their languages to
[36:12] where they are and it turned out to be
[36:15] Elohim like
[36:17] hiim and see then that would compare
[36:20] with Elohim see it's not a not Elohim
[36:26] you know is
[36:27] Elohim all right and then he received
[36:30] part of his name but not to just say the
[36:33] name starts off with
[36:35] ha you know it's meaning giving him part
[36:39] of the revelation of himself into him
[36:44] for the
[36:45] time all right he gave him a name change
[36:49] that name change fit right into do it
[36:53] we're supposed to have had a name change
[36:56] we're Christian
[36:57] all right so then that gives us part to
[36:59] do with it but now Abram in his journey
[37:04] from there to
[37:05] Abraham he met his way was bringing out
[37:09] he met God many times he met melz when
[37:12] his name was still
[37:14] Abram but then he finally become Abraham
[37:18] and that way it was fitting in in the
[37:22] correct
[37:23] order as to the time and the part
[37:27] all right but
[37:29] now I want you to think about just a
[37:33] little part I want to bring
[37:35] out it says here in Hebrews
[37:40] that Abraham was called to go
[37:45] out you
[37:46] know he got up and
[37:50] left he didn't know where he was
[37:54] going he was just told to get up and
[37:58] leave but he was going and even though
[38:02] he didn't know where he was
[38:05] going I'm sure
[38:09] that
[38:10] Abraham
[38:13] realized that something was going
[38:17] on and that's what I wish we could
[38:21] see that if God is concerned enough to
[38:24] you and
[38:25] I
[38:27] to give us the
[38:31] word now little personal right okay give
[38:35] us the word here in Lula that's not like
[38:38] average places of just going to church
[38:41] and being good and claiming to believe
[38:43] the message and and all of the things
[38:46] and not knowing what's going on but he
[38:49] has given us an
[38:50] opportunity to be able to hear amen well
[38:55] why would it say about Abraham
[38:59] that he was called to go
[39:02] out into a
[39:06] place that what
[39:09] them which you should actually receive
[39:12] for an
[39:15] inheritance all
[39:18] right and he went out not knowing
[39:21] whether he went we deal a lot with not
[39:23] knowing whether he went you know we we
[39:25] emphasize that but just
[39:30] remember he believed he was going
[39:36] somewhere and where he was
[39:38] going was his rightful inheritance
[39:42] right
[39:46] right now take time sometime to
[39:50] read the uh life story the things of
[39:55] Abram there in the scripture and
[39:58] Abraham and
[40:00] uh notice where he
[40:04] went cuz remember if you go back there
[40:06] and read
[40:07] it he says
[40:09] wherever you set the soul of your
[40:13] foot I'll give it to
[40:18] you you know that's really
[40:21] something now he was down in the earth
[40:23] childes as we get to in a little bit he
[40:25] was Gentile and a
[40:28] heathen
[40:30] right and yet God called
[40:33] him and said I'll give
[40:37] you everywhere he didn't say I'll give
[40:40] you Jerusalem I'll give you Canan I'll
[40:43] give you this he said I'll give you
[40:52] everywhere first
[40:55] step Footprints means possession
[40:59] right first step you take going give it
[41:03] to
[41:05] you and everywhere you
[41:07] walk I'll give you that land for an
[41:11] inheritance because that was what he was
[41:14] saying follow the Journey of Abraham
[41:17] just read
[41:19] it he goes here he goes here he goes all
[41:23] the way through
[41:25] Canaan
[41:29] read
[41:30] it it wasn't when Israel crossed over
[41:33] and went over you know into he went all
[41:36] over Canaan traveled he went down into
[41:42] Egypt he went into all the countries you
[41:45] know places where he tried to give Sarah
[41:51] away and all of the bad that was taking
[41:55] place
[41:58] God said I'll give
[42:00] you wherever you set your
[42:06] foot now we're going to get to it in a
[42:09] minute so keep this in mind and remember
[42:13] Abraham is the
[42:16] father of us
[42:24] all we say well it's only only the faith
[42:27] seed that's good because that's where it
[42:30] comes down
[42:33] to but
[42:35] remember even the Gentiles as we call
[42:40] it through
[42:43] Hagar come from
[42:46] Abraham Abram if you want to call it to
[42:48] keep it technical some things so he's
[42:51] the father of us
[42:55] all
[43:00] and that's wonderful but get to Point
[43:02] everywhere you set your foot so he told
[43:05] him go out into a
[43:10] place which he said I to receive for an
[43:13] inheritance
[43:15] obeyed he went out not knowing where he
[43:19] was going He travel he got in trouble
[43:22] he'd go this way he'd go that way things
[43:25] would happen he he would go turn his
[43:28] journey but my point is if you'd look at
[43:30] it on a map and you got Abram as his
[43:33] name was then he's all over
[43:39] Canaan was that not the country or the
[43:41] part that Joshua was to lead him across
[43:46] to he walked down through
[43:52] Jerusalem
[43:55] right
[43:57] see when Joshua and them went over they
[43:59] were just going over to take
[44:02] possession but where Abraham had
[44:06] walked because it was a natural
[44:11] thing but now what I want you to think
[44:14] about
[44:15] in today is to watch Abraham in the
[44:19] natural
[44:21] yeah but watch it becomes more into the
[44:25] spiritual
[44:28] all right and you'll see that what I'm
[44:31] trying to
[44:32] bring that Abel by
[44:36] Revelation spoke of the coming
[44:40] Messiah
[44:42] Enoch walked off of the Earth by
[44:45] believing Hebrews
[44:50] 13:8 Noah has his part and Builds an
[44:54] ark
[44:57] and basically all of that was
[45:00] related
[45:01] to them
[45:05] personal
[45:08] right you understand Abel offered a
[45:12] sacrifice
[45:14] Enoch was not because God took him it
[45:17] just by itself see Noah comes along it
[45:21] picks up that he's got his wife and all
[45:25] of the kids
[45:29] but when you come to
[45:32] Abraham you begin to look at
[45:35] things
[45:37] that you
[45:39] know turning more from natural to
[45:44] spiritual all
[45:46] right now
[45:49] because everywhere you set your foot
[45:51] I'll give it to you as an
[45:54] inheritance
[45:57] and that was
[45:58] Palestine that was uh
[46:02] Jerusalem that was Canaan
[46:05] land he goes into Egypt he goes
[46:08] everywhere that's right he starts out as
[46:10] a child
[46:12] e whoever where you're
[46:15] at it's not just making him the heir
[46:19] of
[46:23] Jerusalem are you following me
[46:26] trying to get a little natural something
[46:28] you look at so it's not just that he
[46:31] says I'll give you
[46:34] Jerusalem I'll give you Bethlehem or
[46:38] something like that it's the
[46:43] place look at the inheritance of Abraham
[46:46] and you'll see his
[46:48] descendants are living in those
[46:54] places that more no no matter what we
[46:56] call them today you got
[46:59] the isites coming down and they're over
[47:03] right right now fighting over
[47:09] Jerusalem but you know that hasn't broke
[47:11] one
[47:13] promise God did give
[47:16] them the land of
[47:18] Canaan
[47:20] right a natural
[47:24] land but there was more to the
[47:28] story than Abraham and just a natural
[47:32] part as we'll cover that in a minute
[47:34] that would make us Romans 8 and 28 and
[47:37] 29
[47:42] what no last words a Jew Jew would make
[47:46] him as the scripture would say in Romans
[47:49] 4 and 16 that Abraham who is the father
[47:53] of us
[47:54] all
[47:57] now Paul knew of a coming
[48:01] promised things but he wasn't just
[48:04] dealing with
[48:06] that he knew that God had kept his
[48:10] promise and no matter at the time that
[48:13] Paul was standing there that natural
[48:15] Israel was in bondage to the
[48:22] Romans they were still the
[48:24] conquerors the Romans were the
[48:29] squatters that all belonged
[48:33] to
[48:36] Israel all of that country over there
[48:38] right
[48:40] now see they're making them give up this
[48:43] making them give up that if they draw
[48:46] the biblical
[48:47] lines of the promise to through
[48:52] Abraham America would be flooded with
[48:55] people because if they took everybody
[48:57] out that was
[49:00] not you supposed to be
[49:05] there get what I'm
[49:08] saying the whole part of that
[49:12] country whether it be Egypt whether it
[49:15] be Canaan whether it be the Earth
[49:18] childes whatever it be it all
[49:23] belongs to the Seed of Abraham
[49:26] M and right today the Seed of Abraham
[49:29] inhabits that because the Seed of
[49:32] Abraham through ishma coming on one side
[49:34] of it the Seed of Abraham through Isaac
[49:37] coming on the
[49:39] other all right you could spend the rest
[49:42] of the day talking
[49:45] about how sure the promises of
[49:49] God when I was over there we were there
[49:51] and Reuben said Sam Pray for Peace I
[49:54] said will we pray Pray for Peace Ruben
[49:56] but don't give up one inch of ground
[50:00] that you're
[50:05] holding do they want to force them to
[50:07] give up all of this and they're
[50:10] gradually taking away the biblical
[50:15] promise
[50:17] right still right today that we witness
[50:20] those things all
[50:21] right but see that's not all the
[50:24] story
[50:26] that's just showing that he's the father
[50:28] of the
[50:31] Jew he's the father of the
[50:34] Gentiles he's the father of us all
[50:37] that's
[50:40] right
[50:42] now we'll get back to that in a minute
[50:46] but
[50:50] listen it's not a
[50:53] Jew that's a Jew outward
[50:56] I mean excuse me it's fleshly yeah it's
[50:59] a Jew that's a Jew inwardly is that the
[51:01] words of
[51:02] Paul Paul said all Israel would be
[51:08] saved he didn't say all
[51:10] Jews would be
[51:13] saved but all
[51:16] Israel would be
[51:19] saved
[51:21] right now that makes a great thing to
[51:24] think about
[51:27] because
[51:28] Abraham now Abram if you want to start
[51:31] off with it
[51:34] whatever had he been a
[51:38] Jew making a little point we were
[51:40] talking about this last night the Bible
[51:44] study had Abraham been a Jew then
[51:48] everybody have to be a
[51:51] Jew
[51:54] right
[51:56] are you with
[51:59] me so Paul knew that all Israel were not
[52:05] Jews in the bases of their
[52:09] name they were 12 tribes of
[52:14] Israel Jews only signifies the tribe of
[52:19] Judah and one other
[52:23] there are you for familiar with your
[52:25] Bible if you ain't read your Bible I you
[52:27] know I love to read those things don't
[52:29] you
[52:31] yes we were looking it up last night
[52:33] because I didn't have the notes or
[52:35] anything the first time the word Jew is
[52:38] mentioned is in the Book of
[52:42] Esther it talks about Mori being a
[52:48] Jew but the first time the word Jews J
[52:53] WS is mentioned is in Second
[53:00] Kings it's referring to the tribe of
[53:04] Judah because at that time a division
[53:08] had been made in Israel that 12 tribes
[53:11] were over here two tribes were over
[53:14] here all
[53:17] right
[53:18] now the two tribes which Judah would
[53:21] have been the head of that
[53:23] part was in when into
[53:28] captivity as they did they were called
[53:30] Jews because of coming from
[53:38] Judah but we want to say well Abraham's
[53:41] a
[53:42] Jew no Abraham was a gentile right
[53:47] that's why he could be the father of us
[53:52] all just a little natural part
[53:59] Abraham being a gentile do you want
[54:07] that
[54:09] Jews let's see what let's let's go to go
[54:12] ahead with number three brother and
[54:14] we'll pick it up the communion where it
[54:16] says Abraham was a
[54:19] gentile the word Jew was not even in
[54:22] effect
[54:23] fact the
[54:26] people in Bible times had one name right
[54:32] Joseph but to distinguish that it would
[54:36] say Joseph of
[54:39] armea why because there was a whole lot
[54:41] of
[54:45] Joseph's and see the word
[54:49] Abraham he was called a
[54:54] Hebrew
[54:56] Abraham was called a
[54:59] Hebrew all right the word Hebrew means
[55:04] one from the other side of the
[55:07] river go back to you concordes look it
[55:12] up in other words a man was standing
[55:14] there looking and Abram Abraham or which
[55:17] way you want to go he walks across the
[55:20] river and the man says who are you he
[55:22] Saidi Abraham he said oh you are from
[55:26] the other side of the river and said
[55:29] thereby I'll call you a
[55:32] Hebrew you see that would develop into a
[55:35] name to be brought all the way
[55:38] through if you're a
[55:41] Hebrew
[55:43] okay see that would have brought the
[55:46] name into being of
[55:49] Hebrew Okay Abraham you're a Hebrew but
[55:53] go back in your Bible they was looking
[55:55] it up last
[55:57] night and you know what it says about
[56:01] Abraham that I brought your father
[56:04] Abraham from the other side of the
[56:08] flood who remember that from last night
[56:11] because I didn't really intend to go
[56:12] this way
[56:15] but Joshua I guess I brought your father
[56:19] Abraham from the other side of the
[56:23] flood
[56:26] if you don't believe in predestination
[56:28] you're getting vastly messed
[56:33] up he brought him from the other side of
[56:36] the flood the Big River
[56:38] okay Hebrew the other side of the
[56:43] river and he come down to be called a
[56:47] Hebrew see those names develop because
[56:51] of do it so the name Jew developed
[56:56] because of the tribe of
[57:00] Judah that went into captivity all right
[57:03] go ahead brother we'll put these up and
[57:04] read just a
[57:06] little just bypass go to number five
[57:09] should be enough for our
[57:13] understanding which is questions and
[57:15] answers
[57:18] 63 paragraph
[57:20] 120 now yes these Jews are not not all
[57:24] the Jews will be saved you remember the
[57:27] point there Paul said all Israel will be
[57:31] saved he didn't say all Jews would be
[57:35] saved that's what is
[57:39] it I got it somewhere in here where it
[57:41] said all
[57:43] Israel all
[57:45] right not all the Jews will be saved
[57:48] they'll not be saved only those who when
[57:51] he's speaking of a Jew Jew just is a
[57:54] name that was given to them after they
[57:56] left I believe Nebuchadnezzar over began
[58:00] to call them Jews first because the
[58:03] tribe of Judah was taken then and given
[58:06] a name of Jew and because they came down
[58:09] from Judah and that got the name of Jew
[58:12] but now Israel is
[58:15] different Israel and Jew is all together
[58:21] different not all Jews will be saved
[58:26] but all
[58:27] Israel Paul said will be
[58:30] saved all right because it's not every
[58:33] natural
[58:34] Jew look at Paul I mean look at right
[58:37] around every Jew isn't an
[58:41] Israelite it only distinguishes the
[58:43] tribe of
[58:46] Judah that's why the word Jew was picked
[58:48] up because of the tribe of
[58:51] Judah all right and they called him Jud
[58:54] Jews all
[58:57] right but then Paul never said all Jews
[59:00] will be saved he said all Israel to be
[59:03] saved why Israel's name that's the name
[59:06] of the of redemption of all the way back
[59:10] and all Israel will be saved but not all
[59:13] Judah Judaism will be saved it's
[59:18] not all Israel not meaning all 12
[59:23] tribes
[59:25] Israel is the
[59:27] chosen of God all right but now my point
[59:31] of what I'm getting
[59:33] to Abraham was a
[59:38] gentile well that would put coming from
[59:41] him
[59:45] Judah which would be the
[59:49] Jews but coming from him was through
[59:52] Hagar was the ishmaelites
[59:55] which is you and
[59:59] I
[1:00:00] right no we would never would oh get off
[1:00:03] of it we're
[1:00:06] Gentiles we're in a gentile
[1:00:09] dispensation are we wouldn't be having
[1:00:11] any hope so Abraham is a father of us
[1:00:14] all you know that those ishmaelites over
[1:00:17] there they blow that trumpet every day
[1:00:19] you hear them on the loudspeakers and
[1:00:21] the thing going through and they
[1:00:23] hollering out Allah H holla and Abraham
[1:00:27] Our
[1:00:32] Father know that's who they are all
[1:00:36] right but see it's not all Israel I mean
[1:00:40] not all
[1:00:41] Jews it's all
[1:00:45] Israel all Israel will be
[1:00:48] saved that's God's chosen out of all the
[1:00:52] 12 tribes
[1:00:55] he's not going to choose a certain
[1:00:57] tribe no that was the Jew coming down
[1:01:01] it's all
[1:01:03] Israel all of the true Seed of
[1:01:08] Abraham that come through
[1:01:12] Isaac will be the saved of the
[1:01:15] Israel but yet he started his journey as
[1:01:18] a
[1:01:19] gentile which would bring you and I into
[1:01:22] the situation
[1:01:25] amen that's the whole of Paul's
[1:01:28] explaining when he said for he is not a
[1:01:31] Jew Romans too he is not a Jew which is
[1:01:35] one outwardly neither he is that
[1:01:37] circumcision which is outward in the
[1:01:39] flesh but he is a Jew which is in one
[1:01:42] inwardly and circumcision is of the
[1:01:45] heart in the spirit not in the
[1:01:49] letter now
[1:01:51] listen Abraham a gentile
[1:01:55] makes him the father of us
[1:01:57] all Jews come along in
[1:02:01] Judah which would make this the word Jew
[1:02:04] and we look over our now we say them all
[1:02:06] them
[1:02:09] Jews they're not all
[1:02:11] Jews they're not all from the tribe of
[1:02:14] Judah but they're all
[1:02:16] Israelites whether they be Judah or
[1:02:20] Benjamin or who
[1:02:22] are Abraham is a father of us
[1:02:27] all then take that
[1:02:30] now and remember that he's the promised
[1:02:33] seed that you're talking about and the
[1:02:36] promised seed would be the
[1:02:40] spiritual
[1:02:42] right so he's the father of
[1:02:45] the seed of
[1:02:48] Faith or faith seed if you want to call
[1:02:52] it and from that there would come Jesus
[1:02:57] Christ to bring Redemption to the Seed
[1:03:01] of
[1:03:04] Abraham I'm happy and Paul was happy
[1:03:07] brother R said one day Paul was happy to
[1:03:10] be able to place himself into the
[1:03:14] lineage of
[1:03:17] Abraham not as a Jew he
[1:03:22] says that was automatic Paul was a
[1:03:25] Jew right he was an Israelite let's put
[1:03:29] it make it correct he might not have
[1:03:30] been a
[1:03:31] Judah but you see that's where you can't
[1:03:33] keep all of your natural lineages
[1:03:35] running right Jesus come out of the
[1:03:37] tribe of Judah physically speaking
[1:03:41] coming
[1:03:42] down all
[1:03:44] right would you know that Judas coming
[1:03:46] out of the same
[1:03:50] tribe Judas came from the same tribe
[1:03:52] that Jesus came from
[1:03:55] see that's one thing the Jews could
[1:03:57] never
[1:03:59] comprehend as Paul trying to explain a
[1:04:01] messiah I was saying last night to the
[1:04:04] people he was trying to explain the
[1:04:09] Messiah and they said well which one's
[1:04:11] he come from said won't he come from
[1:04:17] Levi and Paul says no his was not to
[1:04:21] come from Levi it look L like the
[1:04:24] Messiah should have come through the
[1:04:26] tribe of
[1:04:28] Levi right because being the high
[1:04:33] priest but he was not he came from Judah
[1:04:37] because it was promised to Judah a
[1:04:40] lawgiver shall
[1:04:44] come from
[1:04:48] Judah and we can't get it to run
[1:04:50] straight in the natural
[1:04:52] lineages all right just just giving you
[1:04:54] a little
[1:04:57] thought see then Abraham becomes a
[1:05:01] father of us all not by physical
[1:05:09] lineage but by spiritual
[1:05:12] Revelation right amen Abraham is my
[1:05:16] father by spiritual
[1:05:20] Revelation not not genetic makeup right
[1:05:25] why because from the tribe of Judah
[1:05:29] would come the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:05:32] Judah come from
[1:05:36] Abraham but it was the
[1:05:39] promise to
[1:05:41] Abraham remember where we started off
[1:05:43] I'll give you everywhere you set your
[1:05:45] soully feet that got the
[1:05:49] land that got the countries that got all
[1:05:52] of the places that he ever walked
[1:05:56] walked but he wasn't concerned with
[1:06:02] that now think with
[1:06:06] me you know if you got a promise from
[1:06:12] God if you had really a
[1:06:14] promise no brother dick there he's
[1:06:17] about is it 80 something now or 70
[1:06:20] something what is it
[1:06:23] 77 but he's
[1:06:25] 77 78
[1:06:29] okay but you remember a man in the Bible
[1:06:31] one time he he got a promise from God
[1:06:34] because he prayed he said Lord I don't
[1:06:37] want to die till I see the coming
[1:06:39] Messiah and he says you won't
[1:06:42] pass until you see that
[1:06:46] right he goes around and tell everybody
[1:06:48] I'm not going to pass until I see the
[1:06:51] Messiah everybody keeps looking at him
[1:06:54] boy I better hurry
[1:06:56] up you better hurry up
[1:06:59] now you done 80
[1:07:02] 90
[1:07:05] whatever my point is one thing if God
[1:07:08] gives you a promise there is no way it
[1:07:10] can be broken except what you
[1:07:15] do right brother was telling me a great
[1:07:19] promise that God made with him and I
[1:07:21] said brother there's nobody can break
[1:07:23] that promise but you but I said you can
[1:07:26] break that
[1:07:27] promise because you can do
[1:07:31] wrong and it breaks the promises of God
[1:07:33] he don't have to do
[1:07:36] it all right but here comes brother dick
[1:07:39] 78 God Appears to him one day and
[1:07:42] everybody's saying well we're in the
[1:07:43] last days and in the last days and he
[1:07:46] comes along and he says well you know
[1:07:49] the Lord showed me that I'm going to
[1:07:52] live 10 more years
[1:08:00] well if that's God telling you you know
[1:08:03] how long he's going to live 10 more
[1:08:06] years I don't care what you
[1:08:08] think I don't care what he would look
[1:08:10] like at the end of
[1:08:12] it right he's still going to live that
[1:08:18] long you follow me God promised Abraham
[1:08:23] the land
[1:08:24] he got
[1:08:25] it it is the full inheritance under the
[1:08:30] Jews as we call them the
[1:08:36] Israelites and there's no way they can
[1:08:38] take it away from them they can burn it
[1:08:41] they can blow it to Pieces but they'll
[1:08:44] never annihilate the promise of
[1:08:50] God all
[1:08:52] right
[1:08:54] so now as we're going from a natural
[1:08:58] thing with Noah Abel Enoch was more or
[1:09:03] less natural dealing with
[1:09:06] them would you are you following me yes
[1:09:09] now we come to
[1:09:10] Abraham and it connects together with
[1:09:13] all of everything salvation comes in as
[1:09:17] to be the Seed of Abraham by faith all
[1:09:21] right and the promises of God
[1:09:27] like I've always
[1:09:29] said God anointed David to be
[1:09:32] king
[1:09:35] right there was no way he was ever going
[1:09:39] to die that's right I don't care if he
[1:09:41] met a Goliath every day or 10 goliaths
[1:09:44] every day or what he met he was not
[1:09:47] going to die until he sat on the
[1:09:50] throne he didn't say how long you'd be
[1:09:52] sitting on it but he did Say it'll be
[1:09:54] for your
[1:09:56] Generations now see it's God's
[1:10:02] promise
[1:10:04] now it's kind of odd the way Paul
[1:10:08] writes of
[1:10:14] Abraham what he talking about let's read
[1:10:16] it
[1:10:18] again by faith Abraham when he was
[1:10:21] called to go out into a place natural
[1:10:24] Canaan which you should I receive for an
[1:10:27] inheritance obeyed and went out not
[1:10:31] knowing whether he
[1:10:33] went by
[1:10:35] faith he sojourned in a Land Of
[1:10:40] Promise all over Egypt all
[1:10:47] over as in a strange country dwelling in
[1:10:51] Tabernacles are tents and things you
[1:10:53] know this
[1:10:54] going along with
[1:10:58] Isaac and with
[1:11:01] Jacob he lived long enough to see them
[1:11:04] too into the
[1:11:07] point ARs with him of the same
[1:11:12] promise whatever promise was given to
[1:11:15] Abraham was given to
[1:11:17] Isaac was given to
[1:11:22] Jacob
[1:11:26] so they got where they set their foot
[1:11:29] all right what I like is the next verse
[1:11:32] which is a very odd
[1:11:36] situation now that's what I want you to
[1:11:38] look
[1:11:39] at a very odd situation comes into
[1:11:44] being that Abraham is Promised the
[1:11:52] land he's looking for a
[1:11:56] land he's looking for a place to settle
[1:11:59] down right to put his foot and say I'm
[1:12:03] at
[1:12:07] home he walks all over
[1:12:11] Canaan in his journey read
[1:12:15] it Isaac and Jacob and him traveling
[1:12:18] with
[1:12:19] him as he
[1:12:22] Journeys
[1:12:24] but he never is to Anchor his
[1:12:30] feet come
[1:12:32] on because Canaan belongs to the
[1:12:39] Canaanites until Joshua crossed the
[1:12:43] land and then Canaan became as we call
[1:12:46] it the promised
[1:12:48] land right so Abraham never had a natur
[1:12:53] natural
[1:12:59] City but he had a longing in his
[1:13:03] heart you have a
[1:13:07] city what kind of a city was
[1:13:13] that naturally he would look and think
[1:13:15] in his mind and he'd see the beauties of
[1:13:18] some of the countries around him and he
[1:13:20] said one of these
[1:13:22] days
[1:13:24] we are going to have a land of our
[1:13:29] own we're going to dwell in that
[1:13:34] land problems may come in heartaches and
[1:13:39] troubles and said we're going to have a
[1:13:42] land and they
[1:13:44] did Joshua finally
[1:13:49] crossed and when they went into Canaan
[1:13:52] their problem was was they didn't kill
[1:13:54] all the
[1:14:00] Canaanites always our
[1:14:02] problem we want to destroy just enough
[1:14:05] to live and look like a Christian
[1:14:08] but we just leave one little old
[1:14:11] Canaanite and we keep him covered
[1:14:14] up you
[1:14:18] know all right you see where you could
[1:14:20] stay on things a long time but
[1:14:25] but you know the natural
[1:14:28] Jew they lost that
[1:14:32] country because of their
[1:14:35] sin because that little old Canaanite
[1:14:37] that they didn't
[1:14:39] destroy read your Bible they went in and
[1:14:42] they come to complete rest of adoption
[1:14:45] we can type all that all that goes with
[1:14:47] it it goes in wonderful situations or
[1:14:49] what you're typing for for the time but
[1:14:51] they never got rid of all the Canan
[1:14:56] they should have went in there and
[1:14:57] slaughtered every one of
[1:14:59] them they would have had no trouble but
[1:15:01] you wouldn't have a Bible being in
[1:15:03] complete because it' already spoke and
[1:15:05] told what would
[1:15:08] happen so natural Israel was a
[1:15:13] nation under Joshua and the leadership
[1:15:16] coming on down from their
[1:15:19] own but then because of sin in the camp
[1:15:22] as had done before before they lost that
[1:15:27] country but a promise was
[1:15:32] made that the Jews the Israelites we'd
[1:15:36] call it that
[1:15:38] Israel would come forth again as a
[1:15:41] nation no other nation in the world has
[1:15:45] ever come back from
[1:15:47] Oblivion right you know being
[1:15:51] destroyed the Jewish flag is the only
[1:15:53] flag that's ever rose up
[1:15:55] again after that nation was destroyed
[1:15:59] cuz that's what they do with it you
[1:16:00] ought to go over there and
[1:16:03] look like Jerusalem been destroyed I
[1:16:05] forgot how many
[1:16:08] times and they just when they destroy it
[1:16:10] they just come in and build on the top
[1:16:12] of it they just pile up sand and pile up
[1:16:15] rocks and and just get right on top of
[1:16:17] that cuz that's the Conquering power
[1:16:19] youve got underneath you your enemy's
[1:16:22] dead
[1:16:24] that's why they built on top of them to
[1:16:27] destroy to show that it was
[1:16:31] destroyed but you know God promised
[1:16:33] Israel to be a
[1:16:39] nation in the 40s you started a
[1:16:45] war and in that war they come back to a
[1:16:48] place that Allen be was coming
[1:16:51] into those as we'd call them Arabs just
[1:16:55] for a
[1:16:58] word and Allenby was coming in and you
[1:17:01] know they captured Jerusalem without
[1:17:03] firing a shot you know why because
[1:17:06] Allenby was the General and they went in
[1:17:09] telling everybody that Allah was
[1:17:11] coming well they took Alan be and
[1:17:14] translated it to
[1:17:16] Allah and then people throw down
[1:17:18] everything they not to fire shot to
[1:17:20] capture Jerusalem because it was a
[1:17:22] promise in God's word
[1:17:26] but you see Israel now as a
[1:17:30] nation a
[1:17:33] nation okay showing that God would keep
[1:17:36] his
[1:17:39] promise to
[1:17:41] Abraham but you see Abraham had
[1:17:44] something else that's why I like to read
[1:17:46] go ahead and pull that back up
[1:17:48] bro
[1:17:50] on
[1:17:52] Hebrews
[1:17:58] by faith he journeyed in the land of
[1:18:00] promise is in a strange country buing
[1:18:03] Tabernacle with Isaac and Jacob the HS
[1:18:06] with him with the same promise for he
[1:18:09] look for a
[1:18:11] city
[1:18:14] once which has
[1:18:21] foundations we know we look for natural
[1:18:24] City you know what they got a natural
[1:18:27] City but look what Paul was really I
[1:18:30] mean Paul was explaining what was in the
[1:18:33] mind of Abraham for he looked for a city
[1:18:36] which has Foundation whose Builder and
[1:18:39] maker is
[1:18:43] God and more than just looking at a
[1:18:46] natural country to live
[1:18:50] in maybe Abraham didn't understand that
[1:18:55] fully but he had a
[1:19:00] revelation remember that
[1:19:04] Enoch Abel
[1:19:07] Noah Abraham a
[1:19:11] revelation as I said about
[1:19:15] Noah he had a
[1:19:17] revelation that Enoch was
[1:19:20] gone and his son Methuselah
[1:19:23] was
[1:19:24] 969 years old and died he died the same
[1:19:28] year of the flood right in
[1:19:30] the a year or something or a
[1:19:37] flood see you knew what was the
[1:19:39] definition with
[1:19:45] thla his name means one who died before
[1:19:49] the flood we put
[1:19:51] it so Noah
[1:19:55] knew something was going to take
[1:20:00] place he believed the revelation of
[1:20:02] Enoch that I was bringing this
[1:20:08] morning and he believed building an
[1:20:11] ark was his
[1:20:14] job and he saw that Enoch was
[1:20:18] gone in other words it finally doned on
[1:20:21] him as I said this morning
[1:20:23] and
[1:20:24] hey the story of Enoch is that Enoch
[1:20:28] went around telling everybody that he
[1:20:30] wasn't going to die he was going to walk
[1:20:32] off the
[1:20:36] earth and he says you know what I
[1:20:40] believe the old boy
[1:20:42] did I got a revelation I better get to
[1:20:45] working on the
[1:20:46] ark and better get
[1:20:50] inside because his son means that
[1:20:54] he's withus and he was not going to go
[1:20:57] through the
[1:20:58] flood so it's
[1:21:00] close I got a
[1:21:06] revelation Abraham when he was given the
[1:21:09] promise to
[1:21:13] go to a land that I'll tell you of
[1:21:17] however it states it
[1:21:18] there just get up and
[1:21:21] leave
[1:21:23] and all of that walk of
[1:21:26] Abraham it gets to build in a little
[1:21:29] more
[1:21:32] stronger and it get a little bit more
[1:21:35] thinking about
[1:21:37] it and he sees how
[1:21:41] that he met
[1:21:45] God he sees he got a name
[1:21:51] changed
[1:21:53] he seemed that they goofed
[1:21:56] up with s with Hagar but still part of
[1:22:01] that
[1:22:06] land he said
[1:22:09] okay things are building up you know I'm
[1:22:12] beginning to
[1:22:14] realize and maybe the place I'm looking
[1:22:17] for is not here on
[1:22:21] Earth
[1:22:24] are you
[1:22:25] listening maybe he begins to realize
[1:22:28] that if God would keep him from giving
[1:22:31] away his
[1:22:36] wife if God would go out and Conquer a
[1:22:39] nation it's because he goes and gets his
[1:22:43] backsliding kin folks
[1:22:46] lot and no enemy can stand before
[1:22:50] him and all he's got just the house soul
[1:22:52] of slaves as we' call some of them and
[1:22:55] just people living in wouldn't Warriors
[1:22:58] he goes out and defeats nations with
[1:23:03] them Abraham begins to think that maybe
[1:23:07] this ain't all As Natural as I
[1:23:14] think you know I'm really not concerned
[1:23:16] he would
[1:23:18] say with where I want to build this city
[1:23:22] that I believe we going to
[1:23:28] build maybe God is bringing into view a
[1:23:32] more Heavenly thing because evidently
[1:23:35] Paul is expressing the thoughts of
[1:23:40] Abraham right and he says that Paul that
[1:23:44] Abraham
[1:23:45] says for he looked for a city which has
[1:23:51] foundations
[1:23:53] whose Builder and maker is God that was
[1:23:56] not walls and buildings in
[1:24:03] Jerusalem now do you realize that the
[1:24:05] future home that we speak
[1:24:12] of come
[1:24:15] on the future home that we speak of the
[1:24:18] prior to that is a millennial
[1:24:21] reign
[1:24:23] which the the land is supposed to cleave
[1:24:26] and and up comes a
[1:24:29] mountain and the Millennium is
[1:24:32] on and you know what the Millennium is
[1:24:36] to the Jews the
[1:24:39] Israelites it's not for you and I we
[1:24:42] just there on a
[1:24:45] honeymoon
[1:24:46] right it's to
[1:24:51] Israel
[1:24:54] let's just read what brother R
[1:24:57] said go ahead brother and pull up
[1:24:59] questions and answers number six
[1:25:02] 1964
[1:25:04] 8:23 the
[1:25:09] evening and remember God the creator
[1:25:12] that created heavens and earth is in
[1:25:14] glory right now preparing that
[1:25:21] City Abraham looked for
[1:25:27] it and you're going to have to take a
[1:25:29] two-fold thing to think of what I'm
[1:25:30] talking about the Millennium is to
[1:25:34] Israel that is not the future
[1:25:38] home right but in the in Israel to the
[1:25:42] Millennium will
[1:25:45] be even a temple
[1:25:49] built not to offer animal sacrifice I
[1:25:52] say
[1:25:53] no but a temple will be built in the
[1:25:58] Millennium to the
[1:26:01] Jews look what Abraham was
[1:26:04] seeing and remember the creator that
[1:26:07] created the heavens and the Earth is in
[1:26:09] glory right now preparing that
[1:26:12] City Abraham looked for
[1:26:16] it he left his home he separated
[1:26:21] everything that was dear to him and
[1:26:23] looking for what for why now why was he
[1:26:27] looking for now look what he's saying
[1:26:30] follow this
[1:26:31] point
[1:26:32] look he was a
[1:26:37] prophet shake your and get the point
[1:26:40] listen he was a prophet and being a
[1:26:45] prophet he was connected with the
[1:26:48] spirit and part of the
[1:26:51] spirit
[1:26:55] you talking about
[1:26:58] Abraham are you
[1:27:01] reading Abraham being a prophet and
[1:27:06] being a prophet he was connected with
[1:27:08] the spirit and part of the
[1:27:12] spirit and something told him within
[1:27:17] him there is a
[1:27:21] city
[1:27:24] he started looking for
[1:27:26] it said I'm a pilgrim a
[1:27:29] stranger I'm looking for a city whose
[1:27:32] Builder and maker is
[1:27:34] God he knowed that city was
[1:27:39] somewhere oh
[1:27:40] my and I believe that right on the
[1:27:43] grounds where he looked for
[1:27:46] it right there in
[1:27:49] Palestine there's where it'll raise up
[1:27:53] where it's on Mount Zion there's where
[1:27:56] she'll
[1:27:58] be brother it said Abraham after a while
[1:28:01] begins to realize that this is not all
[1:28:04] just a literal City that he's looking
[1:28:08] for in the Millennium it will be to
[1:28:13] Israel as a
[1:28:16] nation and there will be a temple there
[1:28:20] will be beautiful things made
[1:28:25] that's in the
[1:28:27] Millennium that's to Israel that's
[1:28:30] Abraham's
[1:28:35] promise that's his
[1:28:38] City now listen Abraham's promise was a
[1:28:46] city but then when it went from
[1:28:48] Abraham's promise it went to the bride
[1:28:50] of Christ which is the seed of
[1:28:53] Abraham now let's read our
[1:28:56] part okay look at the next
[1:28:59] one paragraph 337 the invisible Union of
[1:29:02] the Bride of Jesus Christ 65

[1:29:35] before then Abraham had that Spirit of
[1:29:39] prophet they look for this day Abraham
[1:29:42] looked for this day he sought for a city
[1:29:46] whose Builder and maker was God it hangs
[1:29:49] right above
[1:29:50] us

[1:30:00] seen in the spirit God descending Out of
[1:30:03] Heaven bore record know that that was
[1:30:06] the son of God and think now he's
[1:30:08] choosing his
[1:30:12] bride the Millennium is to
[1:30:16] Israel and they will have a
[1:30:19] city to fulfill the promise
[1:30:23] to
[1:30:25] Abraham of a literal part that he never
[1:30:29] got to partake
[1:30:31] of yet he journeyed through the
[1:30:34] land and right up there in Canaan land
[1:30:38] right around Jerusalem in the Millennium
[1:30:42] is going to push up a
[1:30:45] mountain all
[1:30:47] right be a beautiful place a temple will
[1:30:51] we built I said not for animal
[1:30:53] sacrifices no but to explain Jesus
[1:30:58] Christ we're going to be there on the
[1:31:00] honeymoon you know what we're going to
[1:31:01] be doing preaching to the Jews to tell
[1:31:04] them about Jesus
[1:31:07] Christ right we're going to be telling
[1:31:10] them we're going to be able to
[1:31:13] tell those
[1:31:19] things you know what I love before then
[1:31:24] there's going to be a marriage supper
[1:31:27] before we go to the
[1:31:33] Millennium you know who's going to be at
[1:31:35] that marriage
[1:31:36] supper we're going to sit down at the
[1:31:39] welcome
[1:31:42] table with
[1:31:44] Abraham Isaac and
[1:31:50] Jacob is that what it says when we read
[1:31:53] it over here that he so journeyed with
[1:31:55] Abraham Abraham so Journey with Isaac
[1:31:57] and Jacob see when you go to the
[1:32:00] marriage
[1:32:01] supper there's going to be some welcome
[1:32:04] guests
[1:32:06] there they will not even be part
[1:32:10] of the
[1:32:13] Bride but will be welcome
[1:32:19] guest which is Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:32:22] or brother
[1:32:23] Tatum every time he testified he always
[1:32:27] said we'll sit down at the welcome table
[1:32:31] with Abraham Isaac and
[1:32:34] Jacob do you see the whole story do you
[1:32:37] need it again and Abraham was looking
[1:32:40] for a natural City that he would have
[1:32:42] upon
[1:32:43] Earth he begins to realized that it
[1:32:46] wouldn't exactly that way and he sees
[1:32:49] because he's a prophet and he's in the
[1:32:52] spirit of the prophets and he sees on
[1:32:55] that there's something else going to
[1:32:57] happen but that one day they will
[1:33:00] be and he saw the Jews coming into cap
[1:33:03] coming into power but then losing their
[1:33:06] power going into captivity because of
[1:33:09] their wrongdoings but in the end time
[1:33:11] that they would come back and they would
[1:33:14] inhabit the land of
[1:33:19] Jerusalem but didn't knew it meant more
[1:33:24] remember it was the spirit of Prophecy
[1:33:26] in
[1:33:28] Abel it said it was
[1:33:30] blood it was a spirit of Prophecy in
[1:33:33] Enoch that said he wouldn't
[1:33:36] die it was Spirit of Prophecy in Noah
[1:33:39] that built an
[1:33:41] ark now we see the spirit of Prophecy in
[1:33:49] Abraham and Abraham
[1:33:52] knows what's going to take
[1:34:00] place he says to his wife one day he
[1:34:02] says now that King's going to kill me
[1:34:06] cuz you're beautiful I believe she was a
[1:34:08] beautiful natural I do because actually
[1:34:11] you get up to be 90 years old before the
[1:34:13] change came I believe she was a
[1:34:14] beautiful woman you know I do I believe
[1:34:17] up to her 90 years of age she was still
[1:34:20] beautiful but he
[1:34:23] said oh
[1:34:25] said we went through a lot of problems
[1:34:28] honey said you going with that
[1:34:35] King he said God's going to take care of
[1:34:39] it because if I've got the promise he
[1:34:42] can't touch you you want the quote from
[1:34:44] the prophet that he couldn't touch
[1:34:48] her he couldn't touch Sarah that King
[1:34:50] couldn't do it there was no way I don't
[1:34:52] care what he was doing he couldn't touch
[1:34:54] him touch
[1:34:59] her maybe he knew a little bit more than
[1:35:01] we
[1:35:03] think he said Sarah save my neck go with
[1:35:07] him cuz God's going to take care of
[1:35:14] you you know s is pretty voluntarily I
[1:35:18] don't think most of your women today
[1:35:20] would want to you know if I just come in
[1:35:22] and told Peggy Saidi want you to go live
[1:35:25] with this guy down here because he said
[1:35:26] he's going to kill me if you
[1:35:27] don't he'd probably say well you better
[1:35:30] go get ready to
[1:35:36] die because I'm not going to do
[1:35:43] that but Sarah just goes along with it
[1:35:48] you so that was a submissive of that day
[1:35:51] uh
[1:35:53] could I remind you that sah was a
[1:35:58] hotheaded like Noah's I mean like Moses
[1:36:01] wife was a hot-headed woman sah was a sh
[1:36:06] a
[1:36:07] conniving
[1:36:12] deceiver it's like I was talking to
[1:36:14] Sister Barbara I say this and quit
[1:36:16] talking to Sister Barbara about the
[1:36:17] people of the women of ish I mean the
[1:36:22] mamad and or what you want to call them
[1:36:24] she's telling me how they was under
[1:36:25] subjection I said hey look don't tell me
[1:36:29] I said they they're under subjection
[1:36:30] because they want to you know they don't
[1:36:32] want to cause no trouble I said women
[1:36:33] are women I don't care what nice and
[1:36:35] ality they
[1:36:37] are African Hindus whatever they're
[1:36:41] smart I
[1:36:43] said don't you remember sitting around
[1:36:45] the table she's gred I said you sit
[1:36:48] around the
[1:36:49] table you hear your stories don't
[1:36:54] you them women is telling each other how
[1:36:57] to connive that old
[1:37:01] man they just look like they're under
[1:37:05] subjection they want the husband to
[1:37:07] think they're under
[1:37:09] subjection women are women I don't care
[1:37:12] where they come
[1:37:16] from
[1:37:18] right come on but I hope you've got the
[1:37:22] story of what I'm trying to bring and
[1:37:24] put together what way we're going to get
[1:37:25] back to Abraham in a little bit you know
[1:37:27] later because we're going to go through
[1:37:29] Sarah and then it drops back to
[1:37:31] Abraham but I hope you understand the
[1:37:35] story Abraham finally catches
[1:37:39] on by
[1:37:41] revelation of what's going
[1:37:45] on he said someday I'll be in that
[1:37:50] City
[1:37:52] someday I'll walk the streets of that
[1:37:56] City and if he's going to be a welcome
[1:37:59] table you know we us at the welcome
[1:38:02] table if he's going to be in the
[1:38:03] Millennium he's going to be in that City
[1:38:06] natural that'll be built but then one
[1:38:08] day there'll be a future home that comes
[1:38:10] down because the Earth will push up one
[1:38:13] more time and it'll be a
[1:38:17] mountain and the future home will come
[1:38:20] down
[1:38:22] Abraham will be able to walk in
[1:38:26] that real City that his
[1:38:31] seed of
[1:38:34] Faith would be there that he would not
[1:38:37] be a part of physically speaking and
[1:38:40] would not be a part of spiritually
[1:38:43] speaking but he'll be a welcome
[1:38:50] guest
[1:38:52] whole lot to think
[1:38:53] about
[1:38:57] right all of them by
[1:39:00] faith Abel Enoch Noah Abraham by Faith
[1:39:06] by
[1:39:07] Revelation they live their lives out for
[1:39:10] you and
[1:39:13] I they saw the coming
[1:39:16] Messiah now if Abraham saw the
[1:39:20] city
[1:39:22] you already knew the
[1:39:25] God right he met Mel jezdic he met
[1:39:31] God and his name changed where he' be
[1:39:35] a a part of the name of
[1:39:40] God these Warriors of faith has already
[1:39:43] made a good report now this is my last
[1:39:49] wording all of the illustrations of Dick
[1:39:51] being 78 promis 10
[1:39:55] years you can't stop it until that 10
[1:39:57] years is done right if it's a promise of
[1:40:00] God you know what he promised to have a
[1:40:03] bride in the last
[1:40:06] days and you know what he's going to
[1:40:09] have one that's right you know what he's
[1:40:11] going to have to go out in the highways
[1:40:13] and the
[1:40:14] hedges that's
[1:40:17] scripture brother around said first pull
[1:40:20] second pull he said third pul he go out
[1:40:22] in highways and
[1:40:24] hedges and compel them to come in and
[1:40:27] the Bible says get the good and the
[1:40:31] bad read your
[1:40:37] Bible you don't just stop on one
[1:40:40] illustration of that read it on until
[1:40:42] you hear him
[1:40:43] say get the good and the
[1:40:48] bad through the opening of the word in
[1:40:50] the lik that days look what the garbage
[1:40:52] cans he's picked up that you're looking
[1:40:55] at standing in front of you and I'm
[1:40:56] looking at in front of
[1:40:58] me the garbage cans that realize we're
[1:41:01] not worth
[1:41:04] nothing and realize if there's anything
[1:41:07] good in US is because of the promise of
[1:41:09] almighty God because our righteousness
[1:41:11] is filthy rags in his
[1:41:16] sight but he promised
[1:41:19] it
[1:41:24] stand ready for the
[1:41:28] communion think on these
[1:41:32] things remember brother Quinn next
[1:41:37] Sunday I'm sure there'll be many more
[1:41:42] that will come to a
[1:41:44] time this day is a word that they'll be
[1:41:46] coming through to minister for us we do
[1:41:49] the best we can you know what I mean
[1:41:51] scheduling and trying to line up the
[1:41:54] ones that we desire to come and be with
[1:41:58] us and just pray that we make the right
[1:42:01] choices
[1:42:03] right do we come to the communion
[1:42:07] part it's
[1:42:11] promised one of these days this won't
[1:42:15] be it's so natural as we do today
[1:42:18] remember the marriage supper is the
[1:42:24] communion we're not going to have beans
[1:42:25] and ters and steaks at the marriage
[1:42:28] supper and be the
[1:42:32] communion fulfill all of this for I have
[1:42:35] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:42:36] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:42:38] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:42:40] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:42:43] he broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:42:45] body which is broken for you this doing
[1:42:47] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:42:50] also we took the cup which he had s when
[1:42:52] he had s saying this cup is the New
[1:42:55] Testament in my blood this do ye as of
[1:42:57] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:43:00] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:43:02] this cup you do you the Lord's death
[1:43:04] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:43:06] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:43:08] W of the Lord unworthily she'll be
[1:43:10] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:43:13] but let a man examine
[1:43:15] himself so let him eat of that bread and
[1:43:18] drink of that cup or he that eateth and
[1:43:20] drinketh on unworthily eateth and
[1:43:22] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:43:24] Discerning the Lord's body is what we
[1:43:27] were talking about last night the body
[1:43:29] of the
[1:43:30] Lord the bride of Christ for this cause
[1:43:34] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:43:35] many sleep where we would judge
[1:43:38] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:43:40] when we are judged we are chasen of the
[1:43:42] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:43:44] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:43:46] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:43:48] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:43:50] eat at home that you come not together
[1:43:52] under condemnation the rest will I set
[1:43:55] in order when I come let's just have a
[1:43:58] few moments of Silent prayer praying one
[1:44:00] for the other for the Lord to open his
[1:44:03] word to
[1:44:05] us and to reveal to us who we are and
[1:44:07] what we're doing here and our
[1:44:09] purpose our
[1:44:11] point of what we're
[1:44:15] doing and our message in the day we're
[1:44:18] living Lord Jesus we love you we thank
[1:44:24] you you made many promises to many
[1:44:28] individuals you promis one thing that
[1:44:32] they to us that we would find our
[1:44:36] place and realize who we
[1:44:39] are and in that we would walk in the
[1:44:42] light of your love we desire that you
[1:44:45] cover our sins and cleanse us because we
[1:44:48] know we're not nothing but Sinners saved
[1:44:50] by grace
[1:44:51] but yet you chose
[1:44:54] us as you chose Abraham in the
[1:44:58] natural you've chosen Us in the
[1:45:00] spiritual and Lord we just ask you to
[1:45:03] help us and guide us as we come to this
[1:45:05] time of communion we ask you to give us
[1:45:09] the right
[1:45:11] understanding that we may walk in your
[1:45:13] loving grace forgive our sins and Lord
[1:45:17] just cleanse us of all things
[1:45:21] and Let It Be You Lord that would
[1:45:23] sanctify and make us
[1:45:26] worthy as we take just a moment of
[1:45:28] Silent prayer then praying one for the
[1:45:32] other we ask you to have the preeminence
[1:45:35] in each one of
[1:45:49] us father we ask you to just have your
[1:45:51] way with all of us guide us now in Jesus
[1:45:58] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:46:00] blessed
[1:46:01] it father we thank you for this bread
[1:46:04] it's been made for this purpose today
[1:46:06] and as we come to the time of partaking
[1:46:09] we ask that you would reveal unto us
[1:46:12] that this is a symbol of your
[1:46:14] word that went
[1:46:16] forth and that it's not a physical thing
[1:46:19] that it's spiritual
[1:46:21] that we do
[1:46:22] physical yeah we see the spiritual
[1:46:26] sanctify this bread to our partakers as
[1:46:29] we all partake of it Lord and we ask you
[1:46:32] to just cleanse
[1:46:34] it our being Lord because within this
[1:46:37] little bit of piece of bread we could
[1:46:39] take could be
[1:46:41] death if Satan could in any way inject
[1:46:44] what he could into it but yet we ask you
[1:46:47] to sanctify it and cleanse it because
[1:46:51] it speaks of your
[1:46:52] word have your way in Jesus
[1:47:08] name we should even thank God for
[1:47:11] every drink of water we
[1:47:15] get everything that we do because Satan
[1:47:19] in this day is doing everything he
[1:47:22] can in every way that he can to try to
[1:47:26] destroy us but yet he can't do it just
[1:47:30] as we talking about
[1:47:32] Abraham that he didn't worry about
[1:47:36] Sarah he said well that old boy's got a
[1:47:39] lot of problem cuz he's going to have to
[1:47:41] deal with God you know if he tries to
[1:47:44] touch you he's going to be dealing with
[1:47:47] God you know we can call him a coward
[1:47:49] and I do because of his doings and ways
[1:47:52] but yet he might not have been as much
[1:47:53] as we
[1:47:54] think he might have been knowing exactly
[1:47:58] that God was going to come on the scene
[1:48:00] to do it and to make it manifest in the
[1:48:03] right way
[1:48:10] right father we just thank you for this
[1:48:13] wine Lord It's a symbol of your blood
[1:48:17] which you shed for each one of
[1:48:19] us as as we eat the little piece of
[1:48:21] bread and we drink this little bit of
[1:48:23] wine tomorrow it will be blood cells in
[1:48:26] our body that we may be able to grow
[1:48:29] thereby and the blood Lord is a purative
[1:48:32] so this wine could be a very purative
[1:48:35] that we would
[1:48:36] need into our bodies we'd ask you to
[1:48:39] just sanctify it and the partakers now
[1:48:42] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:49] amen
[1:48:54] come
[1:48:56] morning I
[1:48:59] walk by the
[1:49:02] river I'll rest me the
[1:49:07] Ever Green
[1:49:10] Tree I'll
[1:49:12] carry my
[1:49:14] cross through the
[1:49:18] midnight come morning
[1:49:21] there's
[1:49:22] glory for
[1:49:26] me sometimes I'm
[1:49:29] despised and
[1:49:32] rejected and I
[1:49:35] question oh
[1:49:37] Father how
[1:49:40] long then I take
[1:49:43] one more
[1:49:45] look at Mount
[1:49:48] Calvary and and it gives me the strength
[1:49:53] to go
[1:49:56] on come
[1:49:58] morning I'll walk by the
[1:50:03] river I'll rest near the Ever Green

[1:50:15] cross through the
[1:50:18] midnight come

[1:50:23] glory for
[1:50:26] me you never know how God does
[1:50:30] things but he's going to make it all
[1:50:32] work for his honor and
[1:50:36] Glory he speaks to the children of
[1:50:38] Israel that when they got out and
[1:50:41] started if they had a known as we would
[1:50:43] call it to paraphrase it if they had
[1:50:46] have known what it was going to be like
[1:50:48] in their Journey they would have prob
[1:50:50] probably wanted to stay with the garlics
[1:50:51] and the cucumbers in the Egypt and the
[1:50:54] bondage cuz they actually got on to
[1:50:56] Moses about it and said that you know
[1:50:59] you would have left us
[1:51:00] alone we at least had the garlics and
[1:51:02] the cucumbers and he got us out here now
[1:51:04] we ain't got nothing oh God comes down

[1:52:50] get everything
[1:52:52] ready read from
[1:52:57] John
[1:52:59] 13 supper being ended the devil having
[1:53:02] now put into the heart of Judas his car
[1:53:04] Simon's son to betray
[1:53:06] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:53:08] given all things into his hands that he
[1:53:10] was come from God and went to God he
[1:53:13] rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:53:15] garments and took a towel and GED
[1:53:17] himself after that he poured water into
[1:53:19] a bason and begin to wash the disciples
[1:53:21] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:53:23] where withth he was GED then cometh he
[1:53:25] to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him
[1:53:28] Lord Dost thou wash my
[1:53:30] feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:53:33] what I do thou knowest not now but Thou
[1:53:36] shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto
[1:53:38] him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus
[1:53:40] answered him if I wash thee not thou has
[1:53:42] no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto
[1:53:45] him Lord not my feet only but also my
[1:53:47] hands and my head Jesus said to him he
[1:53:51] that is washed needeth not saved to wash
[1:53:53] his feet but is clean every with and
[1:53:56] you're clean but not all you know a lot
[1:53:59] of people argue over where Judas was
[1:54:02] still in the upper room well if Judas
[1:54:05] wasn't in the upper room then Jesus was
[1:54:08] talking about somebody else
[1:54:11] being a bad
[1:54:14] egg
[1:54:16] right I mean there's arguments among the
[1:54:18] people of the message whether Judas was
[1:54:19] in the upper room or
[1:54:21] not at the time well if he wasn't then
[1:54:25] when it says here but ever and you are
[1:54:28] clean but not all so there was some more
[1:54:31] that wouldn't right that maybe they
[1:54:33] needed to leave listen or you knew who
[1:54:36] should betray him therefore said he
[1:54:37] you're not all clean so he knew who's
[1:54:39] going to betray so after he washed their
[1:54:42] feet and had given his taken his
[1:54:44] garments and was set down again he said
[1:54:45] unto them know you what I've done to you
[1:54:48] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:54:50] well for so I
[1:54:52] am if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:54:54] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:54:57] one another's feet for I've have given
[1:54:59] you an example that you should do as I
[1:55:01] have done to you verily verily I say
[1:55:03] unto you the servant is not greater than
[1:55:05] his Lord neither he that is sent greater
[1:55:08] than he that sent him if you know these
