[4:50] psalms 133 verse one to three
[4:53] behold
[4:55] how good and how pleasant it is
[4:57] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[5:01] it is like the precious ointment upon
[5:04] the head that ran down upon the beard
[5:07] even aaron's beard
[5:09] that went down to the skirts of his
[5:12] garments
[5:13] as the dew of hermann
[5:15] and as the dew that descended upon the
[5:17] mountains of zion
[5:19] for
[5:21] there shall the lord commanded a
[5:22] blessing
[5:23] even life
[5:25] forevermore
[5:26] these are the words of the lord i'm
[5:28] going to talk about the subject called
[5:30] the headship of the world tonight let us
[5:33] pray father
[5:35] we come humbly before your feet
[5:38] we realize that that nothing is hidden
[5:40] in your presence lord you know our
[5:42] hearts
[5:43] um you know what goes through our minds
[5:46] tonight lord and
[5:49] we just recognize the headship of the
[5:51] world tonight
[5:52] we recognize your presence amongst us
[5:54] and
[5:55] we just ask that you
[5:57] give us inspiration lord help help the
[5:59] minister
[6:01] and he works alike lord and may
[6:04] give us anointing
[6:06] that we may
[6:08] comprehend
[6:09] uh the meaning the true revelation
[6:12] that is behind
[6:13] every word of beer bread tonight we want
[6:16] to give you all the praise and honor and
[6:17] glory i pray that you meet every knee
[6:19] tonight in jesus name amen
[6:30] i hope you can remember to pray for us
[6:33] i told brother dale that we're
[6:35] building a church
[6:37] in in the town of taitai
[6:40] uh he's been to the philippines and uh
[6:42] he can tell you that
[6:45] uh for all these years you know the
[6:47] message came to our country in 1967
[6:51] and this is now 2012 you and you cannot
[6:54] point to a single church that is really
[6:56] presentable
[6:57] may we still we're still having services
[7:00] in
[7:01] living rooms of houses storefronts and
[7:05] uh
[7:06] uh
[7:07] squatters areas
[7:09] uh and and you know we uh
[7:12] it's kind of like an awkward situation
[7:15] for us because
[7:16] here we come in condemned denominational
[7:18] churches
[7:20] and every time we have weddings
[7:22] we use their churches
[7:25] that's right
[7:26] and and it's not easy sometimes you know
[7:28] we we use their facilities when we have
[7:32] big meetings like conventions
[7:34] and
[7:35] before they let you use their facilities
[7:37] they ask you a lot of questions
[7:39] they want to know if you believe the
[7:41] trinity
[7:43] they want to know you believe in
[7:44] speaking in tongues
[7:47] and uh but the lord has blessed us you
[7:50] know
[7:50] i believe in the power of prayer
[7:53] um last june we organized a we call it
[7:57] the prayer chain
[7:58] where every believer is
[8:02] he takes a slap about of two hours
[8:05] praying
[8:06] the whole church prays for
[8:08] uh
[8:09] 24
[8:11] or two hours left
[8:14] for one whole month
[8:15] uh there's always somebody praying
[8:18] for a whole month
[8:20] and you know what the lord honored our
[8:22] sacrifices and answered our prayers
[8:26] supernaturally he provided
[8:29] and now we we
[8:31] bought this property
[8:33] uh in in thai town it's supposed to be
[8:35] in the
[8:36] uh central district business district of
[8:40] the town
[8:42] and when we applied for a building
[8:44] permit to build a church
[8:46] they would not give us a permit
[8:50] now can you imagine how difficult it was
[8:53] for us here we
[8:56] put all our money into this property and
[8:59] now we can't build a church
[9:02] but then once again the saints
[9:06] decided to pray pray about it
[9:09] and then uh uh i got an appointment with
[9:12] the mayor of the town
[9:15] and uh we had a little interview
[9:18] it hasn't been five minutes in the
[9:19] office of the mayor and he said
[9:21] you know reverend soriano this is the
[9:23] work of the lord it cannot be hindered
[9:28] amen
[9:32] and i just want to praise him for his
[9:34] goodness
[9:36] and now the construction is going on uh
[9:38] full swing i showed some pictures to our
[9:41] brother sam here so i hope you can
[9:43] remember us in in prayer
[9:45] because it's such a big undertaking it's
[9:47] a big step of faith uh we have a good
[9:51] crowd a good congregation of about uh
[9:54] close to 400 people
[9:56] but but these are
[9:58] are mostly urban poor people right
[10:01] you know they belong to the uh the
[10:04] poorest of the poorest quarters
[10:06] uh i think brother dale knows what i'm
[10:08] talking about
[10:11] uh amen but uh the lord has already
[10:14] supernaturally provided for a big part
[10:17] of the expense so i i believe that you
[10:19] know he will never fail his children
[10:22] i believe in the power of prayer
[10:25] he is our jehovah gyra
[10:28] hallelujah
[10:30] and so
[10:31] uh not only that i
[10:33] also request the church to pray for the
[10:36] the new groups that we are working with
[10:38] right now
[10:40] there's over a hundred new groups now
[10:42] that came into the message
[10:45] because of the mystery exposed seminars
[10:47] that we're doing sorry uh some of them
[10:50] have uh accepted the message all the way
[10:53] some of them are still studying the
[10:55] message you know a lot of them we
[10:57] baptize the ministers the pastors
[11:00] but the pastors find it hard to uh
[11:03] to present the message to their
[11:05] denominational people
[11:07] and so uh they're seeking our help
[11:10] and we're doing a lot of follow-up work
[11:12] follow-up work we're going uh
[11:14] making trips to the islands and to
[11:17] visit their churches and kind of help
[11:19] the pastor a little bit present the
[11:21] message that we believe
[11:23] and there's there's over a hundred of
[11:25] them so you can just imagine and uh and
[11:29] the pressure that come with it
[11:31] right you know the opposition or the
[11:34] uh organized religion oh yeah and also
[11:37] the persecution that the people get
[11:42] there are many cases where
[11:44] the pastor starts preaching the message
[11:46] using the books that we gave to them and
[11:48] preaching from the books
[11:50] and the headquarters
[11:52] hear about it
[11:54] and they were summoned by the council
[11:57] and they were asked to leave the
[11:58] premises you know they were warned uh
[12:01] and then told to uh recant or
[12:04] or uh uh denounce this message call
[12:08] better banner a false prophet
[12:10] uh but then some of them are making a
[12:13] stand amen
[12:15] and because of that they're being cast
[12:17] out of their
[12:18] places of worship
[12:20] i know pastors who are who who were
[12:23] evicted from their parsonages
[12:26] in the middle of the night just think
[12:27] about it
[12:28] and it's hard for a lot of our um our
[12:31] minister brothers because uh they get
[12:34] all kinds of support from the
[12:35] organization
[12:37] and then when they turn their their back
[12:39] to their organization of course they're
[12:40] turning their backs from their support
[12:43] and they're they're really having a hard
[12:45] time so i i just
[12:47] it's my request that you remember those
[12:50] brothers
[12:51] the ministers especially amen
[12:54] okay so uh
[12:56] seems like the
[12:57] revival fire is still
[12:59] burning in our country amen
[13:02] we'll praise the lord for that
[13:04] because we know we're looking for that
[13:06] last team
[13:08] because i don't care how ready you are
[13:10] here in america right if that last
[13:12] season doesn't come in right now
[13:15] we're not going anywhere
[13:18] but uh uh i i
[13:20] i i know that that god is uh somehow
[13:23] using these seminars and the brothers
[13:26] that uh are involved in conducting these
[13:29] seminars and doing follow-up work to
[13:31] different denominational
[13:33] groups to find that last scene amen
[13:36] hallelujah
[13:39] praise the lord so
[13:42] amen
[13:43] but
[13:46] a lot of these churches
[13:47] they make a stand
[13:49] for the word of god yeah right
[13:51] they know who their leader is right
[13:54] we're not led by no pope or presbyter or
[13:58] some bishops we're not led by men
[14:01] the true church of god is led
[14:03] by by the word amen
[14:06] the head of the church is jesus christ
[14:09] we are being led by our leader today
[14:12] brother bannon pointed to our leader
[14:14] today before he passed the scene
[14:16] before he came off the scene in the
[14:18] message leadership he pointed out
[14:20] clearly who our leader is
[14:23] it's not some holy man
[14:26] it's not some uh theologian right some
[14:33] he is our leader today
[14:36] and that's why tonight i'm going to
[14:37] speak about
[14:38] the handshake right of the word
[14:42] hallelujah
[14:45] we're talking about leadership right
[14:48] we're talking about uh the authority
[14:51] that controls people
[14:53] hallelujah and if the church is ever
[14:56] controlled by an authority should be
[14:58] controlled by jesus christ the word
[15:01] amen all right jesus christ is the word
[15:03] of god amen and in our scripture reading
[15:07] the psalmist david
[15:11] he said how good and behold
[15:14] you'll see what's he he's he has a
[15:16] picture before him
[15:18] amen it is a picture of an anointing
[15:22] it's like a ceremony the anointing of
[15:24] aeron amen
[15:26] he said how good and how pleasant it is
[15:29] for brethren to dwell together in unity
[15:34] unity the unity of the brethren
[15:36] with what he sees in this picture
[15:40] it is like the precious ointment upon
[15:43] the head you see the anointing starts
[15:45] from the head
[15:47] hallelujah
[15:49] and it runs down upon the beard and even
[15:52] aaron's beard that went down to the
[15:54] skirts of his garment
[15:57] as
[15:58] the duo hermann and the dude that
[16:01] descended upon the monster to zion for
[16:03] there the lord commanded the blessing
[16:06] life forevermore
[16:08] david as a military man he was a soldier
[16:12] he was a mighty man
[16:14] uh he was a
[16:16] a warrior
[16:18] he understood
[16:20] the beauty and strength
[16:23] of of the order of command amen
[16:27] you know they call it in the military
[16:29] the chain of command
[16:31] and it can never be broken right
[16:34] uh and it flows from the leader
[16:37] from the greatest leader
[16:39] down to the foot soldiers
[16:42] you know the church of jesus christ is a
[16:44] mighty army
[16:46] amen and and
[16:48] the anointing flows from our head
[16:51] our head is not the military general
[16:55] like i said it's not the pope right man
[16:58] it's not a man
[16:59] our head is the lord jesus christ
[17:02] and all anointings come from him
[17:05] so it falls down
[17:07] it runs to the to every part of the body
[17:11] and we understand being the church of
[17:12] jesus christ as we are the body of
[17:14] christ
[17:16] we become a part of that body by
[17:20] uh by one baptism
[17:23] are we baptized into that uh body that's
[17:27] right and and it's important that
[17:30] we recognize our rightful place in the
[17:33] body of christ
[17:35] this message came
[17:37] to adopt us into the body of christ
[17:40] this message came
[17:42] to
[17:43] uh clearly point to us our position in
[17:46] the body
[17:48] hallelujah
[17:49] and uh you know when the chain of
[17:51] command is broken
[17:54] uh there's bound to be chaos
[18:11] and so i understand that they uh they uh
[18:14] they are ordered
[18:16] the the soldiers are ordered to shoot
[18:18] those who break the chain of command
[18:21] this is a serious offense
[18:23] right that's why
[18:25] it is important
[18:27] to recognize leadership
[18:31] in our individual lives we need to
[18:33] recognize leadership
[18:35] in our lives as believers we need to
[18:37] recognize leadership the reason we need
[18:40] to belong to a local assembly right
[18:43] right you should not be
[18:45] uh uh uh
[18:46] uh just like some christians that i know
[18:49] they just go from pillar to post
[18:53] not not recognizing a home church right
[18:56] barbara said every christian should have
[18:58] a home church
[18:59] and he should recognize leadership right
[19:03] he should have a pastor because he knows
[19:06] that his pastor god ordained him to see
[19:09] him true
[19:11] hallelujah
[19:14] and and uh uh
[19:17] david seems to be saying
[19:20] that that should be the
[19:21] uh that should be this is this should be
[19:23] the setup of the church
[19:25] online things should flow from the head
[19:27] to the body
[19:29] the same spirit that was in christ
[19:31] should be in the body
[19:33] the same anointing hallelujah
[19:36] and
[19:40] david seems to be implying that we need
[19:42] uh we need to be under subjection
[19:47] am i right and not break the chain of
[19:50] command it's a capital offense to break
[19:53] it
[19:54] hallelujah there will be anarchy if
[19:57] people don't know their position
[20:00] that's right oh if you can think of
[20:03] problems in the church
[20:05] church splits
[20:07] it happened because there are people who
[20:09] don't know their position
[20:12] a lot of uh problems that we're having
[20:15] today in the message movement is caused
[20:18] by people who don't know their position
[20:22] some some evangelists
[20:24] trying to be pastors
[20:26] some pastors trying to be missionaries
[20:32] you know some some brothers who can't
[20:34] rule their household and trying to be
[20:36] deacons
[20:38] married two or three times and trying to
[20:40] take an office in the church that's
[20:42] where all the well that's where the
[20:44] trouble come from
[20:46] how many
[20:47] who don't recognize their rightful
[20:50] position in the body
[20:52] if we can only recognize our position
[20:55] our calling
[20:56] the gifts that god has endowed into our
[20:59] lives hallelujah
[21:08] when everyone recognizes his rightful
[21:10] position
[21:12] i'm finding out that people who don't
[21:14] know their position in christ they don't
[21:16] know they they cannot respect
[21:19] they don't respect other people's
[21:21] position
[21:24] amen
[21:25] but when a person knows his position in
[21:27] christ
[21:29] you will have a respect all right and
[21:32] you will recognize other people's
[21:34] position in the body
[21:36] and there will be
[21:37] harmony
[21:39] amen and and and we we will work as a
[21:42] team right we will work as a mighty i'm
[21:45] army
[21:46] we will know the chain of command
[21:48] hallelujah right
[21:51] we live in a day all
[21:53] where people
[21:54] assert their rights
[21:57] when people are
[21:58] very opinionated
[22:01] about what they believe
[22:03] because this is the aids of knowledge
[22:07] great education
[22:08] this is the age of advancement in
[22:12] technology
[22:15] and
[22:15] people have all kinds of convictions
[22:19] they have all kinds of persuasions
[22:23] and and this is also the aids of
[22:25] material prosperity
[22:28] and i'm finding out
[22:30] when a person is materially blessed it's
[22:32] hard for him to humble himself
[22:36] what a person has education
[22:39] he cannot humble himself
[22:42] you know brother bannon even said even
[22:44] in the ministry when god blesses a
[22:46] minister
[22:48] and he thinks that that he's somebody
[22:50] that he's above everyone else and it's
[22:54] hard for people to submit
[22:57] right in this age
[22:59] hallelujah and i just i just thank the
[23:02] lord
[23:03] that we have the message to place us
[23:05] where we should be
[23:07] we have the message to tell us
[23:09] hallelujah
[23:10] that we are we are the church of the
[23:13] living god and being the church we are
[23:16] we are the woman right
[23:20] and a woman batman said it's natural for
[23:23] her to surrender herself to a man
[23:28] and the church of jesus christ it should
[23:30] be natural for her to surrender herself
[23:34] to a man because the head of the woman
[23:36] is the man
[23:38] hallelujah right
[23:40] in in first corinthians chapter 11 verse
[23:43] 3 we see god's
[23:45] divine order of headship
[23:48] the head of the head of the woman is the
[23:50] man the head of man is christ the head
[23:53] of the head of christ is god
[23:56] and and
[24:01] curses the man who will try to
[24:05] break the chain of command
[24:07] this divine order
[24:09] of headship
[24:11] hallelujah
[24:19] you know sisters
[24:21] um
[24:22] you don't wear your uh hair long
[24:26] the the sisters wearing their hair long
[24:29] and wearing feminine dresses
[24:32] it's not just a fashion statement of
[24:34] message believers right
[24:36] you know
[24:37] it has a spiritual
[24:39] meaning amen
[24:41] it says that that the
[24:43] the woman should have power in their
[24:46] heads
[24:47] you should wear a token on your hands
[24:51] because of the angels the scripture said
[24:54] hallelujah
[24:56] now angels are involved here i'm sure
[24:59] right
[25:00] this
[25:02] this submission thing is so important to
[25:05] god
[25:07] that he involves angel
[25:10] they're watching all over the world
[25:13] looking for the token of submission
[25:15] amen
[25:16] you know it's not just you know or long
[25:19] hair it's a power right right the bible
[25:22] said it's the power
[25:24] hallelujah all right and and you don't
[25:28] realize it's sister but you possess a
[25:30] power right on your head
[25:32] it reminds you that you are to submit to
[25:35] your headship right right
[25:38] hallelujah
[25:39] right because um
[25:42] your hair is given to you as a covering
[25:45] right it covers your head
[25:48] just like
[25:50] when uh when the uh
[25:54] rebecca uh
[25:56] covered her head right right hallelujah
[25:59] when he was when she was about to meet i
[26:02] said all right hallelujah
[26:06] and and she had no head
[26:08] yeah and she was going to his head amen
[26:13] hallelujah
[26:14] let me just
[26:16] quote to you a scripture here
[26:22] christ the mystery
[26:24] as the head was took up from the gate
[26:28] from the grave i should say
[26:29] so must his body follow him into eden
[26:33] therefore the body cannot recognize any
[26:36] other headship but the headship of the
[26:39] world
[26:40] no denomination can put anything to it
[26:42] for whatsoever shall take away one word
[26:45] from it or add one another one word to
[26:47] it that they took away from it you're
[26:50] dead
[26:51] hybrid right there
[26:53] she's back here with his testimony in
[26:55] her hands the filthiness of her
[26:57] fornication commit committing spiritual
[27:00] adultery against the very word that she
[27:02] claims to believe see therefore it's the
[27:05] word or nothing
[27:07] hallelujah the church must recognize
[27:10] only the headship of the world
[27:14] not some theologian
[27:16] not some not some big preacher
[27:19] some holy man it's the word or nothing
[27:24] not creeds not denominations right not
[27:27] uh uh uh uh uh
[27:30] traditions right hallelujah but the
[27:33] headshit of the word amen
[27:35] hallelujah
[27:38] thank you jesus
[27:42] so david
[27:43] he understood headship right right
[27:47] and that's why when the philistine came
[27:51] challenging the
[27:52] uh uh armies of israel
[27:58] david was there
[27:59] and he wanted to know what would be the
[28:02] what would be the price yeah
[28:04] what the what would they do to the man
[28:06] that would defeat this giant
[28:09] right
[28:10] and
[28:11] word reach
[28:12] his his brothers
[28:14] and they kind of warn him
[28:17] oh yeah
[28:19] david can't you see how big he is
[28:21] it's impossible to defeat him he's so
[28:24] big you can't defeat him
[28:26] and saul even told him you're just a
[28:28] young boy yeah but this man has been
[28:31] trained from his youth
[28:33] to go to battle hallelujah
[28:35] that's why he uh asked him to wear uh an
[28:39] armor
[28:40] and armor and brother and david wasn't
[28:44] used to that armor he said
[28:46] i've never used this before
[28:48] hallelujah
[28:50] and he wanted to
[28:51] uh he wanted to he went there with this
[28:54] experience
[28:58] his brothers told him he's too big to
[28:59] defeat but david told them
[29:02] he's too big a target for me to miss
[29:06] hallelujah
[29:09] and and it's like winner take all right
[29:12] why do we have to fight ever
[29:15] and and a lot of people dying
[29:18] why don't we just uh take a champion
[29:20] from each camp and the winner takes off
[29:24] if you win we all submit to you
[29:27] but if we win you all submit to us we
[29:30] conquer you
[29:31] hallelujah and that was the deal
[29:33] and praise the lord
[29:36] when when david little david faced the
[29:39] giant uh goliath we know what happened
[29:44] his
[29:45] stone from the slingshot
[29:48] amen went went to the between between
[29:51] the aisle
[29:52] the giant just like a guided missile
[29:55] right right hallelujah and and
[29:58] and goliath fell to the ground
[30:00] but the story didn't end there
[30:02] right the bible says david took goliath
[30:05] sword
[30:06] and
[30:21] amen represents
[30:22] uh the christian that's born of the
[30:24] spirit of god
[30:26] amen not trusting in his own merits
[30:29] in his own ability
[30:31] and he faced the denominational believer
[30:34] hallelujah he was trusting in his spirit
[30:36] and his sword and his seal hallelujah
[30:39] and david said you come to me with your
[30:41] sword and your spirit with your shield i
[30:43] come to you in the name of the lord our
[30:47] god
[30:48] hallelujah
[30:50] david knew who his headship was
[30:54] hallelujah
[31:02] hallelujah
[31:08] we find in uh
[31:10] first samuel chapter 17 verse
[31:13] verse 54
[31:16] where it says david took the head of the
[31:19] philistine
[31:20] and bought it to jerusalem
[31:24] but he put his armor in his tent
[31:29] you see
[31:31] david won everything for the
[31:34] people of israel
[31:36] right and he took it all he conquered
[31:38] everything hallelujah
[31:40] and i think of christ
[31:43] winning on calgary
[31:45] he's the one that represented us on
[31:47] calvary
[31:49] and he won the battle for you and me
[31:52] he conquered everything
[31:54] he conquered all the forces of the enemy
[31:56] amen even death itself
[32:00] he conquered the the uh the grave
[32:03] hallelujah he conquered all sickness
[32:06] he conquered our oppressive spirit
[32:08] hallelujah
[32:10] and then here we are we stand as
[32:12] christians tonight under the banner of
[32:15] the lord jesus christ the message of the
[32:17] hour there's nothing to be afraid of
[32:21] hallelujah because he has conquered
[32:23] everything for us amen
[32:26] hallelujah thank you jesus that's right
[32:33] you see the difference
[32:36] the true church looks to jesus
[32:39] as head
[32:40] right amen colossians chapter 1 verse 18
[32:43] said he is the head of the body
[32:46] the church
[32:47] but the denominational church is led by
[32:50] a man right
[32:52] that's the difference right
[32:55] and brother ben said
[32:57] uh
[32:59] that's the reason we are
[33:02] oh we are not the denomination he said
[33:04] let me go find that a
[33:07] quote there
[33:08] that's the reason we have never become a
[33:10] denomination baptism of the holy spirit
[33:13] 1958
[33:15] the lord has given us the opportunity to
[33:17] merge this little church in many
[33:19] different denominations
[33:21] i know that i know that the uh uh
[33:25] assemblies of god tried to move brother
[33:27] brethren to joining the organization
[33:30] and the united pentecostal church wanted
[33:32] him because of his teaching in in
[33:35] of
[33:36] water baptism in the name of the lord
[33:38] jesus they wanted him
[33:40] and they know that they he would be a
[33:42] big booster to their organization if he
[33:45] joined them
[33:46] hallelujah but he said
[33:49] but
[33:51] we have the opportunity but we don't do
[33:53] it because we want to stay just like
[33:56] this
[33:57] so it can be under the rulership and
[34:01] handshake of jesus christ
[34:04] that's right whether he reveals this to
[34:06] it
[34:07] reveals to us whatever he reveals to us
[34:10] and we see that it's the truth
[34:12] and it lines up with his word all the
[34:15] way back and forth through the bible
[34:17] that is the truth and the spirit
[34:19] agreeing on it then then we have no
[34:22] denominational barriers to hold to us
[34:25] from accepting that we got the if we go
[34:29] we go right ahead into it and move right
[34:31] on
[34:33] hallelujah that's the reason
[34:35] we have the message of the hour
[34:37] and it has not been polluted by any
[34:40] denominational ideas
[34:43] it has not been mixed with creeds and
[34:45] traditions hallelujah we have a pure
[34:48] message
[34:49] and this pure message today will go to a
[34:52] virgin womb of the church hallelujah
[34:56] hallelujah oh i'm so glad that we are
[34:58] free
[34:59] tonight
[35:01] we've not been been brought up and
[35:03] trained to be denominational right
[35:06] hallelujah and and then we we find a
[35:09] certain truth in the bible as long as it
[35:11] lines up
[35:13] with the bible back and forth
[35:15] and the spirit of god is confirming it
[35:18] right and then said the the reason that
[35:21] we know that this message is true
[35:22] because it is vindicated by god himself
[35:26] hallelujah and we are free to believe
[35:29] whatever you want to believe
[35:31] hallelujah no headquarters can tell us
[35:34] what not to believe or what to believe
[35:36] i'm so glad that no hot headquarters can
[35:39] tell us who to fellowship with and who
[35:41] to
[35:42] not fellowship
[35:44] but we are free hallelujah we are free
[35:47] to fellowship with anybody as the lord
[35:49] leaves right
[35:51] i'm so glad hallelujah
[35:54] that as the lord lives i can travel to
[35:56] whatever country i want to all right
[36:00] and and and preach the word right
[36:02] hallelujah without inhibition without
[36:04] limitations right
[36:06] hallelujah that's because brother
[36:08] branham made a stand
[36:10] hallelujah
[36:12] and he did not lean to
[36:15] numbers
[36:16] to
[36:18] to uh uh uh how big the organization is
[36:21] come on how how wealthy the organization
[36:24] is there the influence that they have
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:29] he only trusted in the influence of the
[36:31] word
[36:33] hallelujah amen
[36:36] that's right
[36:38] you know when we started this mystery
[36:39] expo seminars
[36:42] uh the older ministers
[36:46] they kind of belittle my vision
[36:48] right of it
[36:50] because
[36:52] they're saying
[36:53] what are you doing better well taking
[36:54] this message to the denominational
[36:56] people
[36:59] they have already rejected it and now
[37:01] you go and take the message to them come
[37:04] on brother
[37:05] oh
[37:07] and i i just said i just told them how
[37:09] can they reject something that they
[37:11] haven't even heard that's right
[37:14] hallelujah
[37:16] they say but denomination is finished
[37:18] they've taken on the mark of the beast
[37:34] i believe that that we have to give the
[37:36] people an opportunity to hear the voice
[37:39] hear what we believe
[37:40] right hallelujah some of us are just
[37:43] contented that we are in the message
[37:45] but we're waiting for the rapture
[37:55] it's not fair it's not fair that that
[37:57] you heard the message hundreds of times
[38:00] and there are people in the world today
[38:02] that haven't heard
[38:09] upon my heart
[38:11] to take this message
[38:13] to the head
[38:16] the denominational
[38:20] one from this group and one from that
[38:22] group
[38:23] and we were labeled as proselyters these
[38:26] message believers are nothing but
[38:27] proselytes
[38:29] hallelujah yeah so what we did we went
[38:32] right to the head
[38:34] we don't invite the
[38:35] members we invite the ministers the
[38:38] pastors
[38:39] we invite the presbyters
[38:42] and what we do we we just befriend them
[38:45] and we have coffee with them have
[38:47] breakfast with them to uh some
[38:49] restaurant because uh all of the
[38:51] denominational uh organized religion
[38:53] they have uh what we call a networking
[38:56] of ministers
[38:58] and they meet once
[38:59] once a month in a certain place like
[39:02] mcdonald's and they where they uh get to
[39:05] exchange ideas new doctrines and
[39:09] sometimes business deals that take place
[39:11] there and then we just have coffee with
[39:14] them and and and try to find out who's
[39:17] the boss
[39:21] and then we get to befriend the bars and
[39:23] we drop bits and pieces of the mysteries
[39:27] in this message right we say abraham
[39:30] turned to a young man and a woman and i
[39:32] said where did you get that
[39:35] and then we showed them in the bible and
[39:37] they're surprised that it's in the bible
[39:39] it's actually in
[39:40] bible say it word for word
[39:41] right the
[39:44] but it's written between the lines like
[39:46] the prophet said amen hallelujah and so
[39:49] we challenge them
[39:50] would you like to hear some more
[39:52] mysteries like this right and of course
[39:55] they want it uh
[39:58] you know the denominational people
[40:01] the leaders especially
[40:04] uh whether they admit it or not
[40:07] they're hungry for deep teachings the
[40:09] messages
[40:11] for revelations
[40:14] and so okay
[40:16] uh we're going to feed you we pay for
[40:19] the food
[40:20] uh next month
[40:22] at your networking fellowship
[40:24] or as for as long as you sit there and
[40:26] let us explain yeah
[40:29] let us present to you some some more of
[40:30] these mysteries
[40:32] of course we don't reveal our source
[40:34] right away
[40:35] exactly because you know once you
[40:37] mention the name branham
[40:40] first thing they do they go online and
[40:42] type branham and the first hit that they
[40:45] got are useful in negative websites
[40:48] websites that tear down his name tear
[40:50] down his teaching exactly right
[40:52] and and and so we we don't reveal our
[40:56] source right away but we just we just uh
[41:00] show them from the scriptures what the
[41:02] prophet thought
[41:04] about eve not eating an apple
[41:08] about about uh uh mysteries that we
[41:11] believe
[41:12] about the mystery of the godhead and all
[41:15] the other mysteries and and there was
[41:16] this one time in uh sorcerer about uh 12
[41:20] hours south of manila
[41:21] there was a great assembly of god
[41:24] uh group that that came there was about
[41:26] 60 ministers that that were there mostly
[41:29] assemblies of god and the district
[41:31] perspective was present
[41:33] and
[41:34] since the morning
[41:36] till i ended up the seminar this that
[41:38] afternoon
[41:39] he was aiming he was he was even
[41:42] standing and clapping his hands getting
[41:43] excited you know
[41:45] about the new revelation that he's
[41:47] hearing right
[41:49] and then um we have to give out the
[41:51] books of course in the books you will
[41:53] read the name of william
[41:56] so we had to rebuild reveal our source
[41:58] before we give out the books we dropped
[41:59] the bamboo on them
[42:03] and
[42:04] and when they when they
[42:07] when they see the
[42:08] barbarian's name on the book
[42:11] the presbyter man he said
[42:14] mr zaryan reference toriano excuse me
[42:18] you said
[42:19] this whole day i've been amending you
[42:22] i'm excited because all these things
[42:24] that you've been telling us on youtube
[42:25] but they are perfectly scriptural
[42:28] and now you're telling me that this
[42:30] william branham is your prophet
[42:33] he said i can never believe in this man
[42:35] being a prophet of god i've known him to
[42:37] be a false prophet
[42:39] so i told him it's too late for you to
[42:41] say that sir because you've aimed this
[42:43] teaching already
[42:48] you can't say you don't believe in him
[42:50] you believe his teachings
[42:56] and in that way we have won many many
[42:58] denominational groups to the message of
[43:01] glory to god
[43:05] amen hallelujah pray for us because
[43:08] we've been baptizing whole villages
[43:10] crimes of people
[43:13] in mindanao
[43:14] because you know
[43:16] that's the beauty of headship
[43:18] yeah right
[43:19] you know when you share this message to
[43:21] the members of the congregation right
[43:23] then you just get the members yeah right
[43:26] but when you share this message to the
[43:29] hands
[43:30] the leaders you get the head you get the
[43:32] whole group
[43:35] and praise the lord hallelujah amen

[43:42] baptizing struck loads of people

[44:17] god vindicates it
[44:19] god glory
[44:21] god proves that he is in this message
[44:26] let me tell you about my experience in
[44:27] one of the
[44:28] church of christ group

[44:31] philippines

[44:35] believe in in the holy ghost no gift no
[44:38] move of the holy ghost

[45:43] wife they were sitting at the back of
[45:45] the church

[48:01] not whether the pope likes it or not
[48:04] whether the politicians like it or not
[48:06] there will be a virgin church
[48:09] hallelujah that will say be unto me
[48:12] according to your word
[48:15] hallelujah they will say like christ did
[48:17] not my will father but your will be done
[48:22] hallelujah a lot of people think this
[48:25] submission is a your weakness
[48:27] yeah yeah submission
[48:30] like i said is power
[48:32] right yeah sure right yes
[48:37] when christ fully submitted to the will
[48:39] of his father
[48:43] later on he said all power both in
[48:46] heaven and on earth has now been
[48:48] delivered to me
[48:51] hallelujah
[48:53] even brother submitted had to submit to
[48:55] the handshake
[48:59] he would say
[49:00] you know i'm waiting for something
[49:03] i can't do nothing unless he comes
[49:07] and then when the angel comes he would
[49:09] say
[49:10] he is here right man
[49:12] i now take every spirit in this room
[49:16] under my control
[49:18] i'm telling you submission is power amen
[49:22] amen
[49:24] hallelujah
[49:26] people just don't realize it
[49:28] try it
[49:32] because
[49:33] the woman thinks he's a lesser being
[49:36] because yeah he's the weaker vessel he
[49:38] has to submit
[49:40] yeah
[49:41] but you know i looked at that a word the
[49:43] weaker vessel
[49:45] the woman being a weaker vessel it
[49:47] doesn't it doesn't mean a lesser
[49:49] creature
[49:51] but it means
[49:53] something fragile
[49:56] something that needs to be taken care of
[49:59] something that needs to be protected
[50:01] hallelujah you are not the lesser being
[50:07] you answer me the question which one is
[50:09] the greater
[50:11] the protector or the one being protected
[50:17] amen hallelujah
[50:19] i'll tell you your word
[50:22] you are purchased by the blood of jesus
[50:24] christ no less than the life of god
[50:27] hallelujah
[50:29] purchase you
[50:30] glory hallelujah into the body
[50:34] lord of god that's right
[50:37] that's why the verb said they will have
[50:40] his potentials right
[50:43] if you submit to him and take his word
[50:46] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:49] you become part of their body
[50:52] and you will have the potential
[50:54] the potentials of jesus mean
[50:56] all the power that jesus had you will
[50:59] have right the wisdom that jesus had you
[51:02] will have the holiness that jesus had
[51:04] you will have right amen
[51:07] hallelujah
[51:08] they have his potential for he is their
[51:10] head and they are subject subject to his
[51:13] head the headship of christ is his right
[51:19] you know
[51:20] i told the couples
[51:22] in our church you know
[51:25] submission being submit submissive
[51:28] to your head
[51:30] is different from agreeing with your
[51:33] head
[51:36] because
[51:37] there's a lot of sisters that i know
[51:39] they submit if they agree
[51:41] yeah right right
[51:46] the women said wait a minute
[51:49] we're gonna say we're gonna submit all
[51:51] right but let me check if you're correct
[51:53] on that on this matter
[51:58] i don't think it's the women's place
[52:00] according to the word of god to evaluate
[52:02] whether the man is correct or not
[52:08] his position according to the word of
[52:10] god is to submit
[52:12] all right amen
[52:14] that's right but isn't it true but well
[52:16] that the
[52:26] they're off the line they also have a
[52:28] head right right exactly
[52:38] and all your sisters have to do is to
[52:40] talk to their head
[52:42] about it
[52:46] don't try to evaluate just talk to their
[52:49] head about it
[52:58] you know you can't say you are
[53:00] submitting when when when when your
[53:03] husband says honey i'm gonna take you
[53:05] shopping i'm gonna uh buy you a new
[53:07] dress and a new purse
[53:09] and the wife would say okay honey i
[53:11] submit
[53:15] submission is when you can't agree
[53:19] yeah exactly right amen submission is
[53:22] when you think he's wrong
[53:25] hallelujah and still give in right still
[53:28] obey him us your head
[53:31] hallelujah
[53:34] i mean when we came first when we first
[53:36] came to the message from the
[53:37] denomination we came to the message
[53:39] there were a lot of things that we were
[53:41] questioning in our minds right amen we
[53:44] couldn't agree
[53:45] amen hallelujah
[53:47] but because the spirit of god is in us
[53:50] right
[53:50] right whether we understand it or not we
[53:53] just agree
[53:54] we
[54:02] and that's the secret
[54:04] and there is power in submission
[54:07] hallelujah
[54:10] amen
[54:14] a woman is a nature in jehovah
[54:18] chapter 2 or of a woman to surrender to
[54:21] a man it is the nature of the church to
[54:22] surrender to christ surrender to his
[54:25] will just surrender she has
[54:27] no thinking of her own how you can say
[54:30] amen to that
[54:31] she takes his word and not somebody
[54:33] else's right if he would have done that
[54:36] we would have never had to die right but
[54:39] you listen to reasonings
[54:42] but the real bride of christ
[54:44] takes the headship of christ the word
[54:47] and only believe god's word
[54:50] that's the real and the restored bride
[54:55] hallelujah
[55:08] you know god is so much against
[55:10] denominationalism
[55:15] and
[55:20] denominationalism is you can't receive a
[55:22] truth because
[55:24] your pastor doesn't teach you
[55:27] this truth yeah right
[55:29] or or it's not
[55:31] in the
[55:32] statement of faith or whatever you call
[55:34] it
[55:36] of your religious group
[55:38] that is what is keeping you from
[55:40] believing
[55:41] uh the full word
[55:43] amen
[55:44] because
[55:45] your leadership actually you're looking
[55:47] to some man some organization
[55:50] but if he is your leader the holy spirit
[55:53] amen the bible said when he comes then
[55:56] he will lead you into all truth
[56:00] the holy spirit will never lead you to a
[56:02] denominational church
[56:05] yes sir amen
[56:07] and the truth of the matter is no
[56:09] denomination can cope with this word
[56:12] right with the fullness of the word of
[56:14] god tell me one denomination that can
[56:17] cope with it right
[56:18] hallelujah they always have to refer to
[56:22] a certain code right right a certain
[56:26] a statement of faith
[56:28] or whatever they have in the
[56:30] denominations hallelujah but praise god
[56:33] because he is our head
[56:35] we only submitted to his head
[56:39] hallelujah
[56:42] and you know let me just end with this
[56:44] thought
[56:48] uh
[56:51] i'm concerned
[56:53] because
[56:55] um
[56:56] there are some elements in this message
[56:58] that would like to control oh yeah oh
[57:01] lord the church
[57:03] come on brother
[57:05] there are certain camps in this message
[57:08] that
[57:09] that the the
[57:12] they have no qualms about telling you
[57:14] you can't fellowship with this church
[57:16] here
[57:17] you can't have this picture here you can
[57:20] fellowship with that camp over there
[57:23] hallelujah that's nothing but the
[57:24] nomination listen that's right
[57:27] hallelujah some groups they have their
[57:30] pet doctrines
[57:31] and that's all they fellowship around
[57:33] here
[57:34] that's all they can talk about right
[57:37] hallelujah if you can't agree with your
[57:38] pet doping then you're out
[57:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[57:54] just give me a second here um
[57:56] thank you
[57:58] i want to show you something in joshua
[58:00] chapter 6 verse 26 how many knows that
[58:03] the the wall of jericho is a type of
[58:07] denomination
[58:08] right amen
[58:10] said
[58:11] it's a system that separates brothers
[58:16] hallelujah because of some personality
[58:18] or some doctrines right brothers can see
[58:22] eye to eye and they separate over the
[58:24] matter right yeah hallelujah
[58:26] so the wall of jericho
[58:29] stands
[58:30] uh
[58:32] as the people of israel were
[58:34] going to the promised land
[58:37] it's standing in the way
[58:40] that's why god had to break that wall
[58:43] right supernaturally right right
[58:46] hallelujah it has to be done in a
[58:47] supernatural way right so that the
[58:50] people will never forget right that that
[58:53] wall was standing in the way right
[58:56] that that spirit of denominationalism
[58:59] would have to be broken down
[59:02] and that's uh precisely what malachi 4
[59:05] has done in our you know in our days
[59:08] to break down every wall of
[59:09] denominationalism
[59:11] amen
[59:13] after the robe the wall has broken down
[59:16] joshua chapter 6 verse verse 26
[59:19] and joshua adjourned them
[59:22] at that time saying cursed be the man
[59:25] before the lord that rise it up and
[59:28] builded his city this city jericho he
[59:31] shall lay the foundation there in the in
[59:32] his firstborn and his in his youngest
[59:35] son shall we set up the gates of it
[59:38] god so hated that wall
[59:42] that joseph pronounced a curse upon it
[59:45] that's right
[59:46] did not our prophet messenger pronounce
[59:49] a curse against denominationalism
[59:52] that's the reason he said uh by the
[59:54] grace of god we kept ourselves from
[59:57] being defiled by this group
[59:59] we have the privilege of being offered
[1:00:01] to be affiliated with uh big groups but
[1:00:04] we didn't do it we just want to be free
[1:00:06] we just want to believe what we see in
[1:00:09] the world amen
[1:00:10] hallelujah
[1:00:12] and he
[1:00:13] he condemned denominationalism he didn't
[1:00:15] he didn't condemn the people
[1:00:19] but the system right right that keeps
[1:00:22] them from seeing the truth and that
[1:00:23] keeps them from fellowshipping with
[1:00:25] other uh
[1:00:26] christians god so hated that
[1:00:30] you know god is for fellowship how many
[1:00:33] knows that amen he died on the cross for
[1:00:35] fellowship right
[1:00:37] hallelujah
[1:00:39] and he just said separation
[1:00:41] that's why when david saw
[1:00:43] this this image of aaron being anointed
[1:00:46] with oil he said how good and how
[1:00:49] pleasant right it is for brethren to
[1:00:51] dwell together in unity hallelujah
[1:00:54] he must have known how it was for
[1:00:57] brethren to be fighting each other
[1:00:59] and then that's why he praised god he
[1:01:02] appreciated the fact that uh brethren
[1:01:04] are dwelling together in unity it's
[1:01:06] because of that anointing
[1:01:08] amen the holy spirit i believe can keep
[1:01:11] us together right amen the holy spirit
[1:01:14] can break every denominational barrier
[1:01:17] but you know what after joshua
[1:01:19] pronounced this curse
[1:01:21] you read in first kings chapter 16 and
[1:01:24] verse
[1:01:25] 23 and 34
[1:01:29] and i read and ahab made a grove
[1:01:32] and ahab did more to provoke the lord
[1:01:35] god of israel to anger and all the kings
[1:01:38] of israel that were before him
[1:01:41] aha was so influential in his time verse
[1:01:44] 34 it says here and in his days with
[1:01:47] high elf the better life bill jericho
[1:01:52] he laid the foundation thereof in abyron
[1:01:54] his firstborn and set up the gates
[1:01:56] thereof in the youngest sons ago
[1:01:59] according to the word of the lord which
[1:02:02] is fake by joshua the son of god exactly
[1:02:06] hallelujah
[1:02:09] after it's been pronounced people still
[1:02:11] did it right i'm wondering now in the
[1:02:14] message movement oh my god after the
[1:02:16] prophet's soul condemned denominational
[1:02:19] barriers
[1:02:20] hallelujah people are still doing it
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:24] hallelujah that's right but there's a
[1:02:26] curse for people
[1:02:28] who will do it right man that's right
[1:02:31] and a blessing
[1:02:32] for people glory who will stand to the
[1:02:35] principle of non-denominational listen
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:38] and only look to the headship right
[1:02:42] of the world amen
[1:02:44] hallelujah
[1:02:46] if you can only look for the headship of
[1:02:48] the world then we can have his potential
[1:02:50] right but abram said then you can do the
[1:02:53] greater works
[1:02:56] first time barbara explained that
[1:02:59] i i understood him to mean how can we do
[1:03:03] something that is greater than what god
[1:03:06] has already done
[1:03:07] he said it's not really greater it's
[1:03:09] just more in numbers
[1:03:12] but later on
[1:03:14] he preached it more clearly
[1:03:17] he said
[1:03:18] it's actually greater because during the
[1:03:21] days of the lord jesus christ the holy
[1:03:23] ghost wasn't given yet right amen
[1:03:28] so he was not able to impart eternal
[1:03:29] life
[1:03:31] during his three and a half ministry on
[1:03:33] earth
[1:03:35] and that part has been reserved and it's
[1:03:37] been allotted for the bride of christ
[1:03:41] hallelujah because you have been
[1:03:42] destined to do the greater works
[1:03:45] if you only know who your headship is
[1:03:48] sorry you will have the potentials right
[1:03:51] now and you will do the greater works
[1:03:54] hallelujah what's a big word
[1:03:56] imparting eternal life is the greater
[1:03:58] word
[1:04:00] there's something else
[1:04:02] when verbal spoke about the power of the
[1:04:04] third pope the power of the spoken word
[1:04:07] he said you'll be able to speak things
[1:04:10] into existence
[1:04:19] when there was nothing there he spoke
[1:04:21] and squirrels
[1:04:22] existed
[1:04:24] and things started appearing before his
[1:04:26] eyes hallelujah don't you know
[1:04:28] hallelujah that if you only know your
[1:04:31] who your headship is right yeah i see it
[1:04:33] hallelujah and you submit yourself
[1:04:35] completely to him come on hallelujah
[1:04:38] unto his will come on
[1:04:40] that you have his potential so time will
[1:04:42] come amen hallelujah you can speak a
[1:04:46] world and that a world will actually be
[1:04:48] created before your side amen
[1:04:51] and you can actually live in that world
[1:04:55] living the word of revelation
[1:04:57] amen hallelujah
[1:04:59] that's right that's right thank you
[1:05:01] jesus hey we're
[1:05:03] we're in the bible can you find jesus
[1:05:04] creating things into existence come on
[1:05:07] brother it's not there
[1:05:09] it's not there it's promised in this
[1:05:11] time that's right
[1:05:12] the greater works
[1:05:14] the greater ministry
[1:05:16] hallelujah because there will be a bride
[1:05:19] who will recognize the headship amen
[1:05:29] amen
[1:05:31] i can't reach no more
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:40] we sing this song in the philippines
[1:05:42] whatever it takes
[1:05:44] do you see it here too
[1:05:46] whatever it takes
[1:05:56] that should be our prayer tonight right
[1:05:59] whatever it takes
[1:06:01] to be more like him
[1:06:04] that's what i'm i'm willing to do
[1:06:07] if it comes against my ideology
[1:06:10] my education
[1:06:12] if it comes against my reasoning as a
[1:06:14] man
[1:06:15] hallelujah i want to submit right now to
[1:06:18] the headship
[1:06:19] of the word of god exactly
[1:06:22] hallelujah you know people in the
[1:06:24] philippines they abuse this headship
[1:06:26] oh yeah
[1:06:27] they say the pastor is the head of the
[1:06:29] congregation and they're married he's
[1:06:32] supposed to the head to be the head of
[1:06:34] the church and so they become dictators
[1:06:39] and the people just blindly follows the
[1:06:41] pastor because the pastor even uses
[1:06:43] better venomous codes where he said
[1:06:45] right or wrong you have to obey your
[1:06:47] pastor
[1:06:50] that's just another form of deception
[1:06:53] because if you read
[1:06:54] hebrews chapter 13 verse 7 it says there
[1:06:57] obey those that have the rule
[1:07:01] over you who have spoken unto you the
[1:07:04] word of god
[1:07:07] it's the word of god you need to obey
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] like paul said follow me
[1:07:12] be followers of me as i am follower of
[1:07:14] christ
[1:07:15] follow me as i follow christ amen
[1:07:18] said if the man stays with the word you
[1:07:20] follow him if he lives the word you
[1:07:22] leave the man and follow the lord the
[1:07:24] word stay with the word
[1:07:26] and god is the word
[1:07:28] hallelujah amen praise the lord
[1:07:42] it takes
[1:07:44] to draw closer
[1:07:47] to you
[1:07:51] that's what
[1:07:52] i'll be willing
[1:07:56] to do
[1:08:35] whispers
[1:08:50] there
[1:09:03] whatever it is
[1:09:25] and
[1:09:27] whatever it is
[1:09:43] listen to this one lord take my houses
[1:09:54] foreign
[1:10:13] is
[1:10:22] for whatever
[1:10:41] and whatever
[1:11:10] that's what i'll be willing to
[1:11:18] do whatever
[1:11:39] what
[1:11:40] i'll be willing to
[1:12:07] because we look to your word for our
[1:12:09] hatred
[1:12:11] where would we be
[1:12:13] without this message
[1:12:17] thank you that you have
[1:12:19] given us directions lord
[1:12:23] and you have restored your your bride
[1:12:26] back to where she needs to be
[1:12:29] in
[1:12:30] perfect obedience to your word
[1:12:33] hallelujah
[1:12:34] father if there be
[1:12:37] any
[1:12:39] any among us
[1:12:40] tonight
[1:12:45] that has not
[1:12:47] submitted his life completely to you
[1:12:52] maybe some of us are having reservations
[1:12:56] some of us are
[1:12:58] entertaining certain thoughts that are
[1:13:00] giving us doubts
[1:13:02] causing us to doubt your word
[1:13:05] oh father i pray that the holy spirit
[1:13:08] comes and moves mightily
[1:13:11] in this sanctuary lord
[1:13:14] hallelujah over over your bride this
[1:13:18] evening lord jesus
[1:13:20] hallelujah
[1:13:21] and cause her to look to you for
[1:13:24] leadership
[1:13:26] hallelujah i pray for every need in this
[1:13:28] congregation lord if there be any
[1:13:30] sickness i pray in the name of jesus
[1:13:32] christ christ conquered all things for
[1:13:35] us
[1:13:36] hallelujah
[1:13:39] and i rebuke the work of the enemy
[1:13:42] in the lives of each one
[1:13:45] in trying to
[1:13:46] destroy
[1:13:48] the the health
[1:13:50] of my brothers and sisters
[1:13:52] i rebuke him
[1:13:55] and i pray father you restore the help
[1:13:58] of your children tonight
[1:14:00] hallelujah
[1:14:02] and i pray that you cause them to grow
[1:14:06] in the knowledge
[1:14:07] and revelation
[1:14:10] of who jesus christ is
[1:14:13] we understand lord
[1:14:14] you are the word today
[1:14:17] hallelujah
[1:14:18] you'll be with us lord
