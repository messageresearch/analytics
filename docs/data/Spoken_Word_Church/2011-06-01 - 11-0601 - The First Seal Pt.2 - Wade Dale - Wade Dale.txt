are are apt to teach we all have a little something to say God give us all little something to say if you got the Holy Ghost you do have something to say that's right Revelation chap 6 verse one we're going to kind of continue in our thought from last last time we spoke and um y this thing going in and out okay just sounds different we're going to start with verse one and let's bow our heads and remember brother Aaron I don't know about the kids he just called and told brother Joe brother Joe Canada I'm assuming that they're all okay so let's just remember them in the word of prayer dear

and heal them Father we pray that you just come now and open this word Lord to us we've come to the end of the road Lord now we've come to the time that that we don't need to be playing around Lord that we need to be we need to be sealed up with your word bless us Lord give us strength in Jesus name amen Revelations 6 ver1 and I saw something John saw I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word I trust that everybody had a good week so far today was a bit stressful on my end but that's okay it always is right before you get ready to go on vacation so but uh we got to still continue on the thought of the first seal and just kind of background a little bit for last week or last couple weeks ago that when we look at these seals we see that it it it opens up something that was never known before to man right all right so we can we can be we can have confidence that Paul didn't see this ireneus Mark they didn't see this seal these seals like you and I are supposed to see them so we can have confidence one thing's for sure if God did something for a group of people and he did it for us this group of people and not another right they were a special group of people right amen right all right and then he opened up as we said before when these seals opened and opened a supernatural Fellowship a place that go that God and man had never been before amen and you say oh that was just for the brother random I don't think so right I think we're supposed to be heirs and Joint HS with Christ and Christ is the seal William brandom was not the seal Christ is the seal all right so it opened Supernatural Fellowship not with brother brandom and opened Supernatural fellowship with who Jesus Christ because Christ is the sealed right and then we talked a little bit about the divine nature of God being in each one of us and it has to be there to have Supernatural Fellowship you got to have the divine nature of God cuz without the divine nature of God you can't understand Supernatural Fellowship all right and then Satan we were we kind of backing up here a little bit Satan remember he changes started out with a white horse red horse black horse Pale Horse but God never changes God started on a white horse he's going to end on a white horse amen all right he he didn't start with a blue robe and then everybody gets a white robe no he started with white and he's going to end with white so God does not change he never does change man changes and Satan changes because the Satan can't get you one way he'll go around the mountain to get you in another Direction all right so now and these 200,000,000 demons released on not the world right they were already released on them the 200,000,000 demons the prophet said was given to drive us back to our spiritual Homeland right which is what the word of God glory what Abraham was looking for was not a city with buildings and nails and and put together with hammers and and and you know through ways and and Pharaoh would no he was looking for God in a man he was looking for God God was always wanting to dwell in a group of people amen and he saw it in one man called MDC but I still don't believe Abraham had the true Revelation like you and I have the true Revelation cuz Abraham didn't know about Jesus Christ exactly amen you and I did all right so now when we come up to the seal this thing fit and popping up me tonight now now look we're get to review back over again the first seal opened up white horse rider went out and him that sat on him had a bow Crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and then John remember John you have to take the Bible and look at it in a in a way that where John was standing at and looking at the vision and he was he admired this church Church remember in Revelations about about 17 or somewhere in there he just admired this church well now honestly goodness John did see a white horse go out riding and a man on the horse right but God is not wanting us just to see a horse he's wanting us to see the power behind that horse or the power that was given to that horse because the man gets off and the horse just keeps on riding right what the power of the people Satan rides on the people for long enough he gets them believing a certain way and then he just goes over and grabs another group of people and that's what he did in the First Ages there he took in and got a white righteous Church they were they were the alpha church we'll look at it in just a few minutes they they had what a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost Quran they had the fruits of the spirit they had all these things working in the church correct exactly all right that was why that it was a copy C that because it would if it would have started with a church that wasn't very fundamental or a church that was very uh what you might say a bunch of babies that white horse wouldn't have rode out because that white horse is is in opposition but it's it's in a parallel because he wants to look just like what that church is everybody understand that amen okay he wants to look like that church he don't want to look different cuz if he looks different up Pops a flag right right something's wrong oh a new idea no no no no no they started with that same idea and he just rode right over there got real close to that real white church right and what did he start doing he started eroding or eating that's where you get into your pommer worm what did the pommer worm eat fruits of the spirit ate the fruit amen what's the first thing Satan's going to do he's going to eat the fruit cuz what is fruit reproduction right he's trying to keep a Son of God from being born again amen that's right that's what he started in the Garden of Eden rightly the fruit of the womb was supposed to been spoken word seed right and we got a natural thing out of it right all right so Satan starts and he gets he copycat and he goes down through these ages and he hides himself the man of sin is what it's a mystery of iniquity right right it's a mystery of iniquity so now let's go excuse me let's go to the Book of James James 1 and I did forget to tell you that it's raining real hard and and hailing outside so praise the Lord the hail was about size of a pee so it's not going to hurt anything but uh if your windows are down you got a wet car now on the inside excuse me but it is R it was raining pretty hard just a few moments ago it's quit Okay thank the Lord for the rain anyway we needed it James 1 verse 13 let's read 12 blessed is a man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him right let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God so don't worry if you're being tempted it's not of God all right but now God allows Satan to tempt you for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man right but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust a own lust right and enticed right then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringeth forth death now if you'll remember back several years ago brother Dale preached on this and and we've done it a few times away from here but lust lust conception sin and death those are four things just like your four horse riders just like your four your first four seals you can parallel those together but what is does it start out with it start out it starts out with lust right when lust is conceived it bringeth for sin amen all right so now and we're looking at the mystery of iniquity what's the first thing Satan remember the Battle Ground started in heaven right when Satan lusted after a different Kingdom than what God had exactly he wanted something better than his maker correct right and you see what it got him it got him thrown out of heaven right right so when lust ha conceived it bringing forth sin look how it keeps progressing keeps progressing more and more but now let's look at this lust and remember and it's a hard thing to say but lust is something we deal with yeah because it's a part of our life it's a part of our our being is the thing that got us in trouble to start with yeah okay I don't believe Eve lusted after the beast but that part was still opened up to the lust part and then she took it to Adam and then here we are but and it's not it's not bad to to have good thoughts about your wife your spouse whatever your husband but this mystery of iniquity iniquity is something that you do and you should not have done it and you knew it wasn't that ignorance is okay it's all right to be ignorant of something if you were if it was not in ever taught in this church that that cursing was bad and nobody ever in your life told you and you did that and somebody allowed that to happen then that's just and you somebody come and say hey man you're not supposed to do that well I was ignorant but once you were told right it's not ignorance anymore if you do it again that's iniquity that's knowing to do right and not doing it right all right so you start with the first seal and we see that how he he come in excuse me he come into that first church age let's just kind of take a little a little trip into the first church age because remember what happened in the first age the first church age started with a grown group of people amen everybody understand that say amen amen all right for the ones of you that didn't the church age began right around the day of Pentecost there and then Paul comes in but they were a very mature people right they had come to a place to where that God had been working in their life all the fruits of the spirit all the things working in in the church and then what happened to those people and I kind of wrote it down in the book here a long time ago I'm reading from notes that I did in Jamaica about 6 years ago so I'm kind of pulling things back out of here um to show you though that it goes right along with it because they were Christians by birth in the first age right yeah right right they were persecuted all 11 were killed except for John or 12 were killed except for John all right but then the persecuted they were Christians by birth but then they went to Christians by name and became the persecutors right exactly right amen from the first age right they come right up and they were they were the they were the cream of the crop they were the they were a white righteous Church you couldn't put a finger on their life right but something happened and let something let the bar down let the goats in done something something happened because they started beginning to Satan began to erode or eat eat that fruit of the spirit Up the Love The Joy the peace the longsuffering and all those things they should have known better right that man of sin that mystery of iniquity was starting in a form that they had never seen before right cuz back when they developed it was a bunch of drunks or pores prostitutes all those things then you had the Christian people then Three Ages later you really couldn't tell the difference I hope you're getting something here right could it be happening again because that's the alpha bride and this is the Omega bride we know the alpha bride fell but the Omega bride is not supposed to fall the real bride is not supposed to fall right so we see I I've seen many times that that you look at this first seal and you think well that's it the white horse rider was the Antichrist and and he went riding out and and you know conquering to conquering and he conquered but you know there's a lot more to this yeah now you look through the Bible and you can see even over and let's go over to Genesis and look at Cain and Abel just for a second this has been Ted to you before but if we don't see the seals from Genesis to Revelation then you and I because remember brother brand said it didn't become a brand new chapter right he didn't say it become a brand new chapter in the book he said it became a brand new book right the whole book became new right what you do Brother Anderson you okay yeah okay all right miss him sitting there I just just realized he wasn't there he short as he is Genesis CH 4 verse four and able now remember this is the two Spirits this is the two this is the two um good and evil or you know what I don't even like to call it good and evil anymore cuz there's not good and evil anymore right Satan has become so good so there's no good and evil anymore right what is evil drinking smoking gambling cursing doing the things of the world is that what's evil no what's evil is is this man of sin sitting in the temple of God right showing himself to be as God I told him this weekend Brother Richard somebody preaching in a pull pit yeah exactly right black is s on the inside right but somewhere just like in that first age God had power but he gave power to Satan power was given and then what did he do he went forth conquering and to conquer the people let him in cu the people equ what giving them power right all right so watch chapter 4 and Abel he also brought the firstling of the flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering in other words what Abel had was righteous to God right correct because God had the Lord cap Lord he had respect un Abel and his offering Abel was contacted with God one onone now remember Cain was also contacted with God one onone right right right there was no priest king or Pope in between all those but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect right and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy count countenance Fallen right in other words why have you left your first love you should be doing like your brother Abel why have you started your own Doctrine oh yeah your own idea your own thought I'm bringing it into the church age but let's bring it up to this age yeah all right because the church ages we know it's kind of easy to say what they did cuz you can see it in the history if thou doest well shal thou not be accepted and if thou dust not well sin lith at the door right and unto thee shall be his desire who sin right and thou shalt rule over him right let's read that again if thou doest well so at that point Cain knew he wasn't doing well right right it was brought to his attention brother Danny he may he may have set all that fruit up and until this point in time he may have thought man I'm okay just God's going to just come in here and just bless me somewhere sometime but when God said if thou doest well and do like your brother Abel exactly you'll be blessed Cain knew then his offering was not good right all right so what happens that lust in abble and Cain's heart cuz it says right here if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his what is the definition of lust y desire right his desire and thou shalt rule over him then we see it went further that Cain was talking to Abel many times we've seen this about the about the doctrine but look Abel and Cain were standing Cain was just as righteous as Abel until they come to a point point to where God came on the scene right exactly and said hey this is right and this is wrong same thing within each each of our lives right we may have thought and that's you know Cain and Abel's not what the devil didn't bother me when I was the devil's property you bother me brother Danny I stick a water tobacco in my mouth and it didn't bother me a bit might have bothered you a little but not me but when God came on the scene in my life and started cleaning this old guy up the old desire or the lust was still there for that tobacco God took it away but your body still craved it oh yeah cuz you're human you're a human being same way right here Abel knew he was right that first church age knew they were right they had signs they had wonders they had God working in their Church and in their life and then here come another group of people weaving their way in trying to get what they had Satan's not trying to get something different he's trying to get what you got right cuz if he can get the Holy Ghost he can really do some damage that's right but he can't praise the Lord he can't if he did he'd be your brother right but now in that age you can see this Cain and Abel working in that first age because you had a a part of the age where in 303 that n come into being now what happened at n and n of Rome they brought a group of people up they were they were talking about something a discussion now brother Brown said they should have never went right right all right but they went anyway and like brother D's always said I believe that's true even in 606 when they adopted all these things cuz it took 300 years the devil is not he don't do things real quick right it was 303 and 606 that's about 300 years all the ones with the 303 is dead yeah gone but their Doctrine lived on right cuz in 606 they instituted the the um the baptism in name the father Son and Holy Ghost and and you know three God or God in three persons and all those things it took 300 years for Satan to weave his way in but once he weaved his way in he had the people amen he was on that horse and you couldn't get him off amen right so he just got off and slid over himself let that white horse go on and he got on a red horse and he started killing conquering more and more we know that's in the second seal but in this first seal let's let's go back let me read something to you here seal of God 1954 let's talk about the Christian for a minute first thing we ought to get settled now is what is the Seal of God don't you think that would be essential is a Bible a good enough word for you now I know you have them that that want to say keeping the Sabbath day but that's not one spec of scripture to support that in the New Testament you see what he's saying somebody else said something else yeah there was another idea out there that if you just keep the Sabbath or if you do this or if you do that see Satan working but watch turn to Ephesians 4:30 you don't have to mark it down grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of your Redemption now what does sealing mean sealing is a sign of completion is that right now Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God not the Holy Church of God the holy spirit of God that was the problem they began a holy church in the first age oh yeah left out the holy God right but they put the holy church up in front of the holy God right and then you got the mess that you were in all right cuz to me folks let me just give it to you plain it when I was just kind of going through this sure I saw what was going on at n we were we saw what was going on in the first age we saw what was going on in the people but I see it going on now yeah cuz remember that white horse brother Brown says rides right on into eternity and brother D now we're talking about this other day that's kind of hard to believe right sorry it is cuz Satan's not Eternal but it keeps R he said rides on into eternity what maybe Eternal judgment yeah cuz that's what he's taking the people with him right he's taking them right into Eternal judgment all right not eternal hell but there is an eternal judgment right all right just like there's an eternal Redemption thank God for that amen but grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption and a seal represents a finished work nothing is sealed like you seal a boxar and he explains that God comes around and finds a lot of foolishness in us he just don't seal it yet sees a lot of unbelief he just don't seal it yet but when it's all packed up with Full Gospel then he sealed it that's right sealed it till its destination is that wonderful all right now look the people in the first age we know they were sealed away every Church age had a bride that was sealed away in the arms of God in that sixth Dimension and put in there to be resurrected but now there was a system that stayed there a system yeah remember brother R talks about Satan Superman well now I don't look at it as one person yet Brother D cuz it's not one person yet yeah right it will culminate into one person yeah but Satan Superman was a system right A system that came among the people telling them it was okay to do this it was okay to do that it was okay to wear pants it was okay you see that thing coming right on and just riding right on into this church age all right but God wants though to seal a group of people in the end time with these virtues right that the first church a didn't have all the virtues now we know Paul and James and Peter and all those had these virtues working in their life but they didn't have all of them it's like I was telling them last Sun this past Sunday brother Richard this Holy Spirit right here brother brand watch what he says he said in the vision or in the dream remember Sister Shepherd's dream he was somebody was pouring water in the top and what was coming out trash right out of the virtues uhhuh yes sir cuz you're born again right here yeah you born again right here when he was pouring the water in the the dream was that the trash was coming out and running down the side the trash was still coming out in all these virtues being working in their lives they had workings in their lives uh and I want to try to get to something on a coat of many colors uh brother Dale's been speaking of it but this is to me this is Brother Joel this is a coat of many colors right if I saw Joseph's coat and we saw it we can see it in some of the pictures it's what Stripes one color here one color here one color here all right Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God brotherly kindness but the Holy Spirit was what was is what in now is holding everything together problem was a lot of these people didn't have all the virtues and power without character is satanic right so a lot of those people went to that nice in Council that were babies yeah oh yeah and got caught up into the what do you want to say the Limelight or got caught up into a new doctrine or a new thing look at the people in the message some new doctrine comes out they'll just get caught up and they just their their eyes is blinded yeah it's that same spirit that caught them in the first church right amen that thing's not dead people that thing's More Alive now because it's got more power right power was given to Satan but where does that power come from the people right comes from you and I if we don't have hey we still got trash we still got trash even right here we got trash right cuz you don't just get virtue and then you don't get anymore knowledge you get you brother yeah you got if you're right here B you got it all no these lines are just for us human beings to realize that it's a steep stepping stone right but if you could if you could paint that brother boy it'd be virtue and and virtue would weave all the way up to the top knowledge would weave all the way up to the top because you don't just get knowledge and then that's it right you don't get patience and that's it right believe you me I remember today about 25 times I had to have patience M so I didn't just get patience I you got keep getting patience right and I promise you you see this one right here Temperance will sure do a lot with a lot of us with patience right but what am I trying to say the same spirit that was working in those in those people in the first church age Faith virtue knowledge temper fa because they had the divine nature of God right Peter James Paul that's where you get to B all right now that comes to to n and and the pommer worm starts eating those fruits away when he starts eating those fruits away they start going we need something new we need something new a new doctrine we need a new way we need um U now now Kan if you'll do well but now Kane's going if I My Brother's Keeper M right in other words if I got to do my sister have I got to do like my brother who are you to tell me what I got to do right well if God's working in brother Dick's life I need to be acting like brother dick right not the human part but the the part that the virtue is Flowing from but you and I I'm not saying that funny I meant that we have a we have a a human part of temperance though that we don't want exactly right brother boy he over shaking he's beating his head against yeah but that's not human virtues if you born with the divine nature of God you have those virtues working in your life and they're not human they're divine right that's why I say that that Supernatural Fellowship has been open I can see more of this as being a supernatural patience yeah you think supernatural patience God had supernatural patience for you didn't he right amen it was Supernatural because most of us don't have enough patience for each other right right it was Supernatural right that patience I don't know why I'm getting off on this but supernatural patience Supernatural Temperance Jesus was pretty Supernatural wasn't he right he he he uh drove some people out of it yeah out of a church one time that was U yet premeditated he platted the ropes and I don't believe the Rope was this long either you ever try to I've platted June's hair and it's about this long and it sure takes a while I bet he was standing there plating figuring out what he was going to do but you know what that's an example for you and I that's Supernatural Temperance you ever thought about that those verses are Supernatural right now were they so much excuse me in the first church age that they had all the gifts working they had all the things in their life they had brotherly kindness they had godliness they had those things but what was different from them and us that white righteous church called n you can call it Rome whatever but to me Rome is just a name it's like cancer cancer is just a name okay it's mystery babon it's it's the mother it's the things that we know that it is but the world calls it Catholicism M or or romanism or whatever but remember romanism became what became Catholicism right during this time of this of this first seal opening where this white horse rider went riding out and riding out where was he riding he was riding in a group of people amen right he wasn't riding out uh you know in a group of drunks no he was in the church right he wanted to be in church right amen Satan loves to go to church right cuz he gets in your mind and he plays he plays in mine so I know he plays in yours but this Fellowship our fellowship with God became so real in a little Prophet till he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand man and there goes the white horse rider in opposition he was it was the um doctrine that he had had all those years 1958 he preached a mighty conqueror and he preached Revelation 6 verse1 and two all right and we know for a fact that that was because brother brandham didn't know any different right God didn't reveal everything to the prophet but when he he brought him to this one week of Supernatural Fellowship oh if that angel had not come into the room that angel had visited him for a long a lot of times before but what about this angel coming into the room right and telling him that hey that thing riding in you is the same thing that started come on people that started back in that first age right cuz remember he said he had to preach Church ages he had to preach Daniel 70 week get all that in order he says out of the way but out of the way to me means in order right amen I mean he didn't have to a lot of people say oh he just got them out of the way brother D no he put them in order right he put them in order so you and I could understand what the church agees paralleled with in Daniel 70 weeks it's all Redemption redemption in the seals is redemption so it's all Redemption right right but he to open Supernatural Fellowship you got to expose the bad in your life because you can't have Supernatural fellowship with a holy God brother R said you can't do that right remember that time he told the little white lie he was born again yeah I'd say he had some of the virtues working his life wouldn't you and he told a little little white lie when he went to pray for a baby God said take your dirty hands right dirty off of that baby go make this right what about you and I right what about you and I especially when we come into church and we want to get something from God yeah and we got everything in the world on our mind right right um we we hinder a lot of people being prayed for because of our attitude yeah okay we all do all do that's why if you want to pray if you want to see something happen pray that God take all the stuff out of your life first amen come on let's get down now we're going to get down into our life amen cuz I believe when Paul was preaching he preached to those Corinthians he got down to where they lived Glory right he said it's not lawful for you to have your mother-in-law you can't do this you shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be doing this right right so let's just get down to bare facts why do we not get receive our healing why do we not not receive I I I pray all the time for our for every person in this building to to just be filled with the Holy Ghost amen have the new birth right kids right on up to adults doesn't matter Glory okay right why doesn't it happen my sins and your sins what brother Ram said unconfessed sins right so when someone comes up for prayer first thing I say is God you've heard me say this before but someone you I say God do not let my life or what I'm thinking stand in the way of that person get healed because see that person has to have personal faith that person's got to have a personal faith when he come he or she comes up here he has personal faith brother brand said I'm not operating this gift right you're operating this gift amen I was reading it yesterday or day before yesterday one where he was he said you're just pulling right and left he told a man to sit down he said sir would you sit down or the next time in other words he said the next time he said let whatever it is be on your head why because they were moving through people it was Spirit yeah and you can feel them up here you feel them back there right but what are we going to let's look at this thing right here just for a second we're not going to be long what should we be looking for in the steps of the way of our of our progressing right sister Anna um the way that we progress you look at that first church age and you see that that they didn't so much and God forgive me if I'm wrong they didn't so much as progress they regress right right yeah Paul said Grievous wolves is going to come in oh yeah what did Jude say let's go back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints right amen we've lost our first love so in Revelation says amen they didn't go from from from from being a powerful Church to being a more powerful church right they regress instead of progress right now you and I can't we don't have that hope there's not another age brother Mark there's not another day that you and I can throw this off on another group of people right we can't say oh we can't understand a seal so maybe the new guys are going to come up and bring it to us we can't do that right right the Bible says today is the day of your salvation amen today is the day for you and I to understand the Bible says the mysteries of God be revealed to me and you the mysteries of God didn't say that in the first age it says You and I the mysteries of God be revealed when that seventh angel sound the Myster of God will be finished and then John takes the book out of the Angel's hand the Angel didn't take the book out of the Angel's hand John on top of you and I the bride took that book what brother Brom say the lamb took the book right sat down on the throne open the book right amen what's our problem we shut it back we don't like what it says right we open up this page we shut it back we don't like what it says we open up this page shut it back we don't like what it says right power was given sure power was given to you and I but now listen those things in that church age became just as sayings right there was no head there was no there was no Pope yet Constantine was was ruled and Satan was working and doing the things that he was trying to do there was not a man there yet remember the crown Crown was given right to somebody and brother Brown said you can't Crown spirit that spirit is what was working in that first church age like I said it wasn't Satan Superman it was it was Satan's system it was the system he was working under not a system of more pornography of more this and more that no it was a program right of more do ideas maybe some things that never been heard before let me tell you something I was telling them up at Brother Richard we cannot plead ignorance right right today right they complete ignorance in that first church on certain things because certain things are not been made known the light had not Shone on certain things like it is now but you and I we can't do that right we can't plead ignorance and say Lord well I didn't know that so now what are you and I supposed to do I believe one thing's for sure God has a white righteous group of people amen that started in the first Age come on and if you can say it you got more white y because more has been revealed to us more has been made known we know we should know how to act amen we should know how to treat our brothers we should know how to treat our sisters and not be brother Brown said the other day I was reading he said this was not done in a corner his whole message everything he done all the healing campaigns he said this was not done in hiding that's right he said this is in plain view right of the world Amen now as the mystery of iniquity is a mystery and that that man of sin hides his so God is hiding you and I right a group of people that looks like just maybe an outscout rag tag group of people remember Samson I like Samson cuz Samson did not look like Arnold spener right Samson looked like Don knot oh my with seven little curls hanging down his neck but brother R said I was reading yesterday brother Brown said said said Samson walked up to those Gates of that City and said all he done he just reached back and he felt those locked right and that little shrimp picked up 2 and 1/2 tons each of gate and picks him up why do you think the Philistines was running around trying to get his trying to get where his strength was if he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger they knew where he got his strength from but they found a little rag tag boy a man running around with seven curls on his in his in his head same way with you and I we look like when we're weak we look like that we don't have anything going on we look like but God's hiding himself glory in a group of people in the end time more than he's ever cuz he's going to have to hide us we can't hide oursel he's going to have to hide us and let me tell you something death going to hide a lot of us right death h brother Tom right cuz I say before remember we was talking about downstairs he was planted in corruption but he'll never come back in corruption he'll come back Incorruptible because he went down in corruption what his mom and daddy gave him but he's not going to come back in corruption anymore right I told you and I said when they shut that casket I said you'll never see that man right there again that's right you've known him all these years but you'll never see that guy right there you'll see that 18y old man but you'll never see that old guy again cuz that's what Mom and Daddy for is right that's what you and I have that this first age did not have right is a revelation that we're going to the end not going down we're going up right you believe that that's amen that's exactly what's happening but be careful because in Matthew 24 we'll be finished in just a second not very long turn to Matthew 24 look at verse but if you really you can really see the character of those seals remember the first seal was the lion right went out with the boldness of the lion amen l i o n not ly Li lion and they were bold but Jesus comes to Matthew 24 and he tells them he preaches the seals he he he shows them he says take heed that no man deceive you though he starts off pretty pretty pretty bold don't let anyone deceive you right here's the deception for many shall come many not one or two brother de many in that first age they just flooded in that second age they just flooded those people with with the doctrine of of the Catholic Church beginning of the Catholic church but it flooded them it it just over it just overrun them right cuz that horse had a lot of power amen and a horse without somebody guiding it he going to run over you yeah all right that's what happened but watch for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ right and shall deceive many amen many millions billions amen not deceived by good and evil yeah we should know evil right remember the Bible says shun the appearance of evil but what does lust do what does what does the innocence of lust do if you were to try go and try to commit adultery on your wife or your husband what's the first thing lust does it draws you away from your partner yeah right right amen and that's exactly what Satan wants to do he wants to draw you away from your partner amen cuz if he can draw you away from your partner then he can get in and he get in this thing right here and then what happen to this right here it acts out in the rest of this okay that's things that we have to look for children are not uh children or are children in the Lord the same way but God began Pentecost in the day of Pentecost he began riding through the ages starting with a lion right roaring out what was he doing now look look they were the original they were the elect for the day there's no there's no question about that they were the elect lady for the day right but they weren't the complete lady right they were a bride the original brother called Paul the original everything that come out of that first church AG was original Fai of the fathers exactly they kept the name alive they kept water baptism alive as long as they could they kept they kept the deity of Jesus Christ but going into that next age or going into actually the pergam age about 606 what happened Satan began to eat that word down oh yeah he began to erode it you can't kill the word of God right but you can kill the effects of it word's always there right the word was there in power in the first church age true but but what happened they let a group of people get in and start separating us from our mate yeah when lust is conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it's finished if you stop any of those spots though it's not so bad let me let me just be plain lust is not bad if you don't let it go so far you understand what I'm saying I mean we lust after cars and we lust after this it ain't just lust after women or men we lust after things right what it's Look up the word lust it's a desire for something okay it's a desire to do something or a desire uh you know we we we have a desire to to come to church that's not a lust but it starting in an innocent in innocence Satan was sitting in the same seat with the righteous yeah real close he he's your closest friend yeah if you let him but these people for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many now watch what happened in the first age and we'll finish right here in the first age they had the deity of Jesus Christ correct because it was one God they knew that right all right they knew Jesus Christ was almighty God they didn't you didn't have to go and and sit down and and read a book about it they knew that water baptism the name of Lord Jesus Christ they had that that was that was ingrained in their mind all right but they started falling away from the things in that age little sayings oh yeah little things that came out that maybe shouldn't have come out listen to this this is what's going to be made no what third seal 1963 tried to find it in the first seal but I couldn't find it so but brother R if you'll read the seal book he goes back and and reviews the seal before and sometimes he'll pick up the seal before that right right read that seal book as a everything laps over itself just like he said to laugh over the church ages and and you know to laugh over these seals they laugh over each other it's it's a book right right remember I told you I said when when brother Bram the most important seal is that first seal because when that first seal open when he tore that first seal off it opened the book right it opened this book so that the second seal could open right everybody understand that say Amen right they had to it's the first seal if that thing was still sealed up right here I don't care if there's 100,000 seals in there but when that first seal was open it became brand new book right amen not a chapter not a verse it became brand new new book Glory when it become a brand new book listen third seal now Lamb's got the book in his hand breaking the seal broke the first one second one and now he breaks the third one and as he breaks it the lamb breaks it the third seal the third Beast now how many knows what the third Beast look like look like a man the first one looked like a lion the other one cine o and the third one look like a man as a man and as he heard the living creature that the Beast living creatures like a man said to John come see what it is this mystery that's been hi right now John types the bride right right that lion Spirit lion lion not lying lion spirit said come and see in other words step into this part of the vision with me amen okay cuz that was the Bold part of the line he John was the bride the bride for that AG step into it come and see in other words come and see what's going on Amen all right all down through the years of redemption since the foundation of the world it's been hid under this seal what's going to happen now come look what it is so he opens it up a thunder blast and the lamb opens the seal that's what happened the line the first seal Thunder blast seal was open now brother bram's talking here about ceiling being a sign of completion oh yeah now in the other part he's saying that it's something open but now watch him with the Box Car the box car is filled with things that are set in their right place right packed in there he said let me make an example packed in there he said oh yeah so they don't shake right amen then what does he do puts a seal on it then when whoever breaks that seal what do they get they get what's inside the box right amen that's the same thing happened with the seals when the seals open we got what was inside the box right right God had packed this thing full before the foundation of the world he said right here all through the years of redemption years of redemption Redemption started at Calvary I don't think so Redemption started before the foundation of the world right cuz that's when the lamb was really slain amen right that's so Redemption started before the foundation of the world before this thing right here was ever written right right that's right and then when that first seal open that give us an opportunity to not just be redeemed in our sub because the first church age and the second Church age in the Third Church AG in the fourth Church AG in the fifth they were all redeemed in their soul right am I correct but when that Prophet stood there and literally opened this thing up to us right it didn't just become a brand new book to him right come on it became a brand new book to Dick Addison cuz dick Addison couldn't find his name in the book with a cover like this right you can't find your name in the book with the book closed right you got to have the book open Paul found his name John found his name magicians come we all have looked down Through the Ages trying to find our name right but the difference in that first age and this age there was scripture in between that had to be fulfilled true right amen there was a time when scripture had to be fulfilled it wasn't time in the first Daye right right cuz brother brandham said he even said that if the Bible had not said that those four Angels hold the Four Winds I was just reading it back there just now that the battle of Armageddon would have started at the first world war sure but one scripture held all that back right amen you ever read that I pulled it up on a quote just just a few minutes ago I never read it before but the they hold the Four Winds or the four Wars yeah brother Brown said if that scripture had not been there the battle of Armageddon would have started after the first world war scripture is very powerful right so the first church age didn't have Revelations 10:7 right they didn't have Revelation 10:7 there was a mystery to be revealed in their age and in their time right but when the seventh angel begins to sound his message which brother bandam said his message began in the what seals seals amen right when he begins to sound that message then let me paraphrase it anything can happen right anything can happen because all the scriptures started one just dropped in line right with the other one dropped in line right with the other the only problem with the difference in what when brother Brandon was standing there on that first seal and today is you and I weren't there right if you and I are predestinated to make this Rapture if you and I are predestinated to make a body chain some of us were not even born in 1963 so it couldn't happen right but see once you get all the players on the field it can happen exactly and I believe Brother Gary all the players are on the field brother dick I don't think there's another generation let stand I don't think there's another time but in that first age that first spirit that went out was an antichrist Spirit it was against the word of God yet it was so close amen it rode almost right on top of that first those first three ages where the pure word came about now what about in the end time right last thing low Matthew 24 low he's over here Christ is over on the other side of the desert that's what the Bible say the Bible says go not there right right Christ Christ is over there go not there right right cuz if you don't believe he's in here right you'll know whether to go there or not right you'll know what to do there's your mystery of iniquity because remember you know better and you do it anyway but if you know better and don't do it greater is he right that can do the Commandments than those that remember the Rich Young Ruler he he took some of the Commandments he said I've been this way since my youth Jesus said sell everything you got in other words sell out right and follow me exactly and it didn't happen he wouldn't do it he lifted up his eyes in hell that was the difference in that man there's probably a lot of Sinners that went to heaven and that man that looked like he was going to make it to Heaven oh yeah he went to hell right but those same spirits that were in Jesus's time come over into Paul's time didn't die brother B I was reading this morning he said everybody close your eyes he said there's a deaf spirit in here and he said that spirit will go somewhere so they don't die they just go somewhere else right let's be careful what we see amen you love the Lord I was wanted to I just wanted you to see just real simple I just want you to see that that first age everybody I think somebody the other day said something but I can't remember exactly what it was but it was like oh that was back then back then yeah well it wasn't bad somebody in a message I think back then that was back then well the first age was back then but you know what the first age that same ly devil and in this age but but oh the word of God in its fullness though is also in it got here first that's right cuz Satan's a copycat it got here first the pure word of God got here first amen then Satan copied afterwards let's sing a song 194 in the redom 194 in the red bom let's sing and worship early today still daylight outside nations are breaking Israel a that the prophet for the Gentile is numbered withs ined eternity soon will unfold the day of redemption is near hearts are failing for be filled with the spirit your left trimmed and clean look up your Redemption is Victory they wanted him to give back to land the other day the guy they got said yeah that ain't the right guy that ain't the right guy Israel don't give up nothing nothing and that guy said oh well we may give up a little bit oh they don't give up nothing God told Abraham every place you put your foot I'll give it to you any wa when you and I people you look at Israel and you see their typ us look at the type brother Dy all the land is mine it's mine got one in this way or that way healing is ours salvation is ours I want it those old Orthodox Jews I'm sure they're sitting there just waiting they're waiting their time they're going to get that land back CU they're promised if they're out of that land they're not blessed PL day how can they believe something that they really don't believe Jesus came but they believe what he said in the Old Testament we believe that that Jesus the Christ is our God this Generations first God's revelation will walk where the apostles have the day of redemption is thank you Lord hearts are failing for fear be filed with the spirit your l c redot that songood wrot that he knew a little something and brother said he knew something he was you know he was right there where the Holy Ghost fell look what he wrote look in the Bible it's like a Bible written right here what we're singing Redemption is near hearts are failing from be filed with the spirit your LS trim and clear look up your Redemption is he was looking forward to something God you and I shouldn't be looking forward to something we should be looking at it the seals have been open if you read your name in the book you ought to Rejoice D God didn't write something in this book and then all of a sudden he's going to eras you out if you believe that's for you that's your book God good worshiping God do you give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are we are love and praise you little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow Ain God good why how you creation I'm a brand new man you know God actually did recreate you he recreated you you going ever see brother Tom like he was before no that was the first Mom and Daddy creation you'll never see that again God redeemed him one day recreated a new man not something different and he didn't pack it up the doctors packed it for a while not now I think about the other day about healing healing is potential body change amen potential body change one day if Lazarus would have c a revelation of what happened to him he never died again but it wasn't his time it's our time it's time for me and you to realize that we God heals something he don't just patch it up he doesn't patch it up you think of all those grows and tumors and brother R called those things and said go away from these people what happened amen what's a cancer cell right it's a cell that's been bruised right right a bruised cell when brother Brenham would talk to those people and say tell that evil spirit to leave we know what happened if it was a growth or something and fall off or whatever but what happened that death he told that one this morning he told he said that you deaf Spirit leave that woman and he talked about one time said that say that a devil would bind a nerve in your ear yeah you think oh this is all medical no it's not all medical right it's the good and evil we just talked about right amen right Satan has took a part of you that was weak in your body not you as a person but in your body a bruised cell right but when brother R and pronounced that thing gone what happened yeah that cell wasn't bruised anymore right it was changed Amen in a moment in the twinkling of an eye cuz brother R said I saw guarders fall off right on right in front of me on the platform what happened they were chained right in the moment potential now not full but potential right potential body change right amen we got to understand healing if we understand healing maybe we need to preach on that a little bit if we understood healing we understand more about Resurrection cuz brother Tom when he comes back up he's not going to have that plate in his leg he's not going to have he's not going to have a scar on him why coach is come right it's been what what' you say healed amen in a moment that twinking of an eye right let's bow our head dear heavenly father thank you Lord for giving us the time Lord to fellowship with you and to fellowship with your people you know father how I love to speak about you in front of people Lord because I want to see you living their life Lord though we be a Cast Away Lord I pray that you would take and touch somebody's life by what's been said Lord that that we truly did touch the mind of God tonight that that we had Supernatural fellowship with you Lord and may we realize that we can have more Supernatural Fellowship you're not a God that that that binds Lord you're a God that frees you're a God that gives Deliverance you're a God that gives healing and and salvation to the soul father how much more should we realize that standing in this end time we are a blessed group of people Glory a group of people that even Paul Paul would probably even as Peter said about Paul Paul says things hard to be understood well maybe Paul would sit in the service and say wow brother Dale says things hard to be understood because Lord we progressed you progressed us in a way that you have revealed yourself you actually brought them your mind right down to a little prophet and then through the mind of that Prophet you brought it down to word so that we as people could understand the most a literate person can understand this gospel but that Prophet brought that word so pure and unadulterated but father it wasn't just the man it was the Holy Spirit Christ the one that brought it down to us Lord and you said you would come and abide and live in us and that you would teach us you would give us the things that we need father I pray that someone in the building Lord that's that's sick and Afflicted Lord even in their in their natural body and even in their spiritual body their spiritual life I pray right now Lord that you would just come down and touch them Father make a change Lord we we know for a fact that the change is already in motion cuz you've changed us Lord from a sinner to a saint but father we are now looking to Wi to understand the Redemption of this body that you sent a little Prophet On In the End Time Lord you said the son of righteousness would rise with healing in his wings and Lord you sent a healing Campaign which give people a temporary Resurrection it raised them up Lord from arthritis and cancer and and my the things that we could set and read that your Prophet went through Lord but we know one thing's for sure you have not left the scene yes Lord we know one thing's for sure that you didn't stop when the prophet left the scene Lord that you're working now in a group of people and not just to heal our body in a temporary Resurrection but father you're healing our body for a spiritual time that we will not ever ever have to be sick again that will'll never have a thing in our body that will that will afflict us Lord Lord and will not be tired and weary but Lord that you would change this body in the moan and the twinkling of an eye amen father we know it's done by the reveal word so I pray Lord that you would continue to bless everyone here Lord under the sound of our voice that you would give us Lord truly the words of eternal life father just bless us thank you for being with us tonight Lord we ask you just be with each one on the way home thank you for giving us the rain father and I pray that you would now reain your spiritual rain down upon us Lord that you would bless us give us
