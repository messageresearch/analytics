[2:58] little this way and then back that away
[3:01] so just bear with me I won't get right
[3:04] to the exact point until maybe on into
[3:07] the last of the message but I'm wanting
[3:10] you to get a point is the time and the
[3:12] Prophet said when you take something
[3:14] said hold it up for the people until
[3:17] they see it he said didn't move on well
[3:20] that's that's what we try to do right so
[3:22] let's do that father we thank you for
[3:24] this day in your grace thank you Lord
[3:27] that you are God and you change not
[3:29] thank you for everything father thank
[3:32] you for the people that's gathered
[3:33] tonight and we pray that you would bless
[3:35] each one as we are all Lord come dark
[3:39] together in our little licks of fire to
[3:42] be able to bind together and fight the
[3:44] enemy and all of his things and the ways
[3:47] of his doing they ask you to bless each
[3:49] one bless those that are watching on
[3:51] internet Lord and just have your way
[3:53] with ever better
[3:54] the little pieces that we have to do
[3:57] with the Bride of Christ around the
[3:59] world we love you and we thank you
[4:01] forgive our sins and guide us in Jesus
[4:04] name Amen
[4:09] so we've been in John 1 in the beginning
[4:14] was the word and the Word was with God
[4:16] and the Word was God
[4:17] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:19] all things were made by him and without
[4:23] him was not anything made that was made
[4:25] and him was life and the life was the
[4:28] light of men the light shyness and
[4:30] darkness the darkness comprehended it
[4:33] not see when I started series I take a
[4:37] scripture and people wonder why that you
[4:40] know this makes twenty-five times I
[4:42] think reading John 1:1 but that's the
[4:45] point I'm still on the Godhead still
[4:49] only being revealed you know I'm going
[4:51] through so I just read the same
[4:53] Scripture yeah I hope it doesn't get
[4:55] boring to you for me to read that same
[4:57] one scriptures you know throughout the
[5:00] whole series I haven't preached 70 or 80
[5:02] services and read one scripture well I
[5:06] hope we got it you know at least we
[5:09] tried any will have okay let's go to
[5:11] Genesis 1 now to 26 but we're going on
[5:13] into verse 28 that will tie into the
[5:16] message and God said let us make man in
[5:19] our image after our likeness and let
[5:22] them have dominion over the fish of the
[5:23] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[5:25] over the cattle and over all of the
[5:28] earth and over every creeping thing that
[5:29] creepeth upon the earth so God created
[5:33] man in his own image and the image of
[5:35] God created he him male and female
[5:37] created he them and God blessed them and
[5:42] God said unto them and what he saying to
[5:46] him multiply and replenish the earth and
[5:51] subdue it that's what he told them to do
[5:54] and how do mean you know the efficacy
[5:57] you know over the fowl of the air and
[5:59] over every living thing that moveth upon
[6:02] the earth you may be seated
[6:04] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[6:06] of his word
[6:08] as I said we're trying to just follow in
[6:12] the thought and we're coming down and we
[6:15] we went backs and some of you missed
[6:17] some of parts of it we went back before
[6:20] the foundational world coming down
[6:21] trying to show the condescending of God
[6:24] in how he would come down to earth and
[6:27] then got through into the parts you know
[6:31] of studying what happened and all of the
[6:33] scriptures and how they tied together
[6:35] and then we begin to talk about mankind
[6:40] and seeing him and seeing God bringing
[6:45] us into being all right so now this last
[6:49] couple of services has been falling on
[6:52] the line of the creation especially the
[6:55] last one there Sunday talking about the
[6:59] creation and I want the main point and
[7:04] I've always tried to get that main point
[7:06] over that God cannot create anything
[7:13] wrong now that's that should be solved
[7:18] you said what I think so that ain't got
[7:20] nothing to do with it you need to spit
[7:25] that thing out of your thoughts that you
[7:27] could think something other than the
[7:29] fact of one time God cannot create
[7:34] anything wrong
[7:35] well now God's God he can do what he
[7:37] wants to see that's how we go in our
[7:40] human mentality and when we do we get so
[7:44] bound up and you'll see when we get
[7:47] maybe maybe not tonight but maybe Sunday
[7:51] coming in with it of unbelief unbelief
[7:56] see and that's what we're doing we're
[7:59] just believing God's Word to see when we
[8:03] have our own ideas our own thoughts and
[8:07] concepts that are contrary to God's Word
[8:10] in other words I don't care what you
[8:13] would think off I'm gonna send it
[8:15] straight this is the way I am the way I
[8:17] always talking we're preach God cannot
[8:20] create anything wrong
[8:21] then you come along and try to prop up
[8:23] some little wool he done this over here
[8:25] and he done this over here and he done
[8:27] it over there what are you trying to do
[8:32] try to show how smart you are or what
[8:35] you find out that's exactly what the
[8:38] devil was doing in the garden because if
[8:43] you don't get nothing out of the message
[8:45] to not remember one thing whatever the
[8:48] original sin was still is and Satan's
[8:55] tactics of using and doing is
[8:59] identically the same today as it was
[9:02] back dark so then that solves the
[9:09] problem like I said then you say well
[9:11] what I think is the it's not God cannot
[9:14] create anything wrong or would he get
[9:19] the material to create something wrong
[9:25] all of God's creation is perfect you see
[9:31] then you taking that's what the people
[9:32] do we'll try to get more into it see
[9:34] this ever but he created the woman did
[9:36] he create the woman in any way with any
[9:45] form thoughts ideas I wrote was there
[9:53] any defect in the creating of Eve
[9:58] comparing it to the creation of Adam
[10:02] remember she come from Adam if you think
[10:07] and try to figure out any defect you
[10:09] know what I mean by that any way that it
[10:12] would have been made to make man fall
[10:18] other than a free moral agency you're
[10:22] going to the basis of Satan's lie and
[10:24] he's still telling you the same thing he
[10:26] told Eve in the garden
[10:30] so just remember whatever the original
[10:32] scene was the original sim still has
[10:39] they then that order solved the problem
[10:42] in our thinking all right
[10:44] are we looking as I said for some way
[10:47] are we trying in some way to figure out
[10:51] something wrong with Eve that made her
[10:55] to the basis that she would do wrong you
[11:08] ought to remember one thing
[11:11] everything physical that was in Eve was
[11:19] in Adam to start with is that enough
[11:26] everything so now how can you make a
[11:29] defect maybe that's the wrong words to
[11:33] use those early human ways but it's all
[11:35] I know
[11:36] if there's anything wrong in the way
[11:40] that Eve was created then God could not
[11:43] judge her for being wrong that order
[11:46] solve a problem in order to stop us from
[11:50] any of those little bitty yeah but I
[11:52] think she was doing which I think she
[11:54] was suggesting she me you're trying to
[11:58] do the same thing that was done in the
[12:02] garden all right Eve was created a
[12:07] byproduct remember what a byproduct is a
[12:14] by-product is from an original creation
[12:25] in other words it was taken from we try
[12:29] to illustrate the cars and everything
[12:31] but that doesn't even work in the
[12:33] kingdom Oh in the gospel see because he
[12:37] was literally bone Adam said of my bone
[12:41] in flesh of my flesh then if that's true
[12:47] then there was no defects in whatever
[12:51] was made in order to get that out of our
[12:56] mind of something that we think and I
[13:01] will hope you listen you know if you
[13:06] miss the services I hope you go back and
[13:09] that's what we make the tapes for to
[13:11] listen to them I listen to the services
[13:16] when I have to miss or something was
[13:19] wrong and I listen back over to the
[13:22] services every Sunday because I want to
[13:28] hear and see and try to understand what
[13:33] we're trying to do and if you miss the
[13:36] service then then you know you need to
[13:40] go back to listen to what you missed
[13:43] yeah well I ain't got time how many
[13:49] hours are the in the day and how many
[13:51] days are in a week and how many times he
[13:54] you're playing in the game the Adam and
[13:57] Eve in the garden and the devil in his -
[14:01] and okay now but listen even everything
[14:09] no matter what animal that you make you
[14:15] don't like the snake he don't make no
[14:17] difference he was created in his
[14:20] original creation it's perfect
[14:23] yes could ever be made and for that
[14:26] reason did we don't you know you want to
[14:31] make this you want to make that no just
[14:33] make it to be one thing God cannot
[14:36] create anything wrong and say thank you
[14:41] lord
[14:44] the because if he could create anything
[14:46] wrong he could judge it you know I mean
[14:51] how could he judge it for being wrong
[14:54] it'd be his fault all right now I hope
[14:58] you would listen as I said to Sunday's
[15:00] evenings message because the pointed I'm
[15:04] driving is remember whatever you're
[15:06] talking about Eve
[15:09] you remember Sunday after Sunday morning
[15:12] service whatever you're talking about
[15:14] Eve her creation are doing whatever is
[15:18] speaking of the Bride of Christ right
[15:26] now whatever you do and you're throwing
[15:30] it to the bride across because she is to
[15:33] be that female and be the same as Eve
[15:39] was she's the Bride of Christ well she
[15:46] went out doing this one huh yeah but did
[15:51] he make her that away no he did all
[15:55] right
[15:56] now let's start then and we'll back up a
[16:00] little come down to that at the end and
[16:02] type together into what we were talking
[16:05] about Sunday but if you went anywhere
[16:09] today and asked in the religious room
[16:13] and you would ask the people what was
[16:17] the original fall what was the original
[16:26] happening in the garden all right they
[16:31] give you a definition of something maybe
[16:33] eating an apple because they can read
[16:38] literal words and see that it was some
[16:41] kind of fruit but they won't have
[16:44] anything to do with the real
[16:47] understanding of what happened right
[16:51] they'll give you a definition of the
[16:56] fall because they realize we did fall
[17:00] all right
[17:02] come down to the believers of the
[17:04] message the end time believers and you
[17:08] ask them and most of them will say it
[17:11] was an act between Eve and the Beast and
[17:18] they'll bring that is there some ation
[17:20] of what you would ask him about the fall
[17:28] now we say well we know that it's not
[17:32] right about the original sin has to be
[17:37] eating an apple we know that's not right
[17:48] but then we will lay heavily on the fact
[17:51] of talking about an act between Eve and
[17:55] the Beast but what would be the original
[18:09] sin what if it would be eating apples or
[18:13] pears or a night between even the Beast
[18:20] when those are attributes of unbelief
[18:31] all right are you gonna follow me now
[18:33] those are not sin remember brother
[18:40] branham preaching that time and
[18:42] preaching real hard you know talking
[18:45] about it wouldn't him sin to smoke it
[18:47] wouldn't send the drank it wouldn't send
[18:49] it of course it wasn't sin and this lady
[18:52] raised her hand and said price sir would
[18:54] you tell me what was the thin he said
[18:59] unbelief now which came first the
[19:08] unbelief
[19:12] or the app whether you want to talk
[19:15] about eating an apple a pyre or
[19:18] pomegranate either whatever you want to
[19:21] talk about which one came first it would
[19:29] have had to been first a spiritual
[19:31] thought our condition to exist and then
[19:39] whatever act is you want to put with it
[19:42] would come with that all right so
[19:46] remember you're dealing with attributes
[19:53] when you talk about anything that you
[19:57] think Eve done all of that is attributes
[20:03] of unbelief so then we know the prophets
[20:10] right in what he's saying let's eat
[20:13] tell me your people in I've you know
[20:16] we've been around enough coming to
[20:17] Methodists Baptists and I they'll talk
[20:20] with you about the original sin is being
[20:23] unbelief because some of them told it is
[20:27] unbelief they'll tell you in a hurry
[20:29] that don't matter what it was
[20:31] is this just unbelief well why shouldn't
[20:38] it be the us come down to that very
[20:41] point and say like brother Branham does
[20:46] on all things are possible them that
[20:49] believe the first original sin was
[20:54] because Eve doubted the Word of God so
[21:05] what was the original sin sirs we would
[21:08] see Jesus unbelief is the original sin
[21:16] unbelief see we we take sin has to be
[21:22] what we do
[21:27] well it wouldn't be no difference in
[21:29] arguing apple an orange whatever
[21:31] anything out see you're talking about a
[21:34] display but remember unbelief is first
[21:41] then we reach some from the Prophet
[21:44] where he didn't doubt God as being God
[21:46] rah but she didn't believe he'd keep his
[21:52] word so what is the original sin when
[22:03] the queen of the south the Prophet said
[22:05] really unbelief is the only sin see
[22:14] there there is no sin outside of
[22:16] unbelief he that believeth not is
[22:19] condemned already see then unbelief
[22:24] being the original sin we deal with what
[22:30] happens within that RIM instead of
[22:35] thinking of the unbelief we do want to
[22:40] think about us being unbelievers right
[22:49] unbelief Christ mister of God revealed
[22:55] what killed Eve the Prophet said
[23:03] unbelief she disbelieved God's Word
[23:12] right see we can get in all and we'll
[23:19] deal more Sunday with more into the
[23:22] reasoning factors of mankind but we're
[23:27] just wanting to talk about it I am
[23:29] tonight a little bit about the fall
[23:33] being unbelief see that at I ever
[23:41] Scripture in the Bible together as to
[23:45] the original sin all right then you
[23:49] should see what I say at the statement I
[23:51] make whatever the original sin was it
[23:58] still is right they still same unbelief
[24:06] no bro today we're believers all right
[24:10] the Prophet said he Eve was a good
[24:13] believer he said she didn't know why
[24:17] doubt they wouldn't know God did she
[24:22] believed in God but said she didn't
[24:26] believe he keep his word truth in what
[24:34] has destroyed mankind and what's killing
[24:37] today every death you see everything
[24:40] happening what is that because of that's
[24:43] an attribute of unbelief
[24:49] everything that happens it's an
[24:51] attribute from unbelief so the original
[24:56] sin was not an act or a happening or
[25:01] an apple or anything you'd want to label
[25:04] it Eve had to first receive in her mind
[25:16] she conceived in her mind you can call
[25:20] it spirit being you can go whatever you
[25:22] want to label your thoughts you can she
[25:28] had to first receive Satan's lie then
[25:35] what was Satan's lie what was the story
[25:37] back there in the garden that we talk
[25:39] about Satan wanted an inroad into the
[25:46] human race true it was trying he was
[25:49] trying to find some way all right I was
[25:51] just looking at him a moment ago he
[25:53] could not create but he can pervert what
[25:59] God creates so he couldn't create in any
[26:04] way and bring himself into the human
[26:07] race he couldn't do that but he saw that
[26:15] there was one little thing way out
[26:18] little way that he could enter the human
[26:20] race and that would be to try to enter
[26:23] by using some of the form then God's
[26:28] original plan and he saw the beast in
[26:33] height would mingle and what would take
[26:35] place remember right around the city
[26:38] even had a knowledge of the principles
[26:40] of life Satan is very shrewd it's not
[26:44] he's not a dummy he knew exactly what he
[26:48] was doing but listen he's using the same
[26:51] tactics today I got these all here if
[26:56] you want and when you won't raise your
[26:58] hand the same tactics he used on Eve
[27:02] he's using the same thing today you know
[27:10] why he's using it like that
[27:13] because he knows it'll work there was no
[27:20] other plan could be broke
[27:22] Satan was so smart he knew what to do
[27:25] and he ain't change that it's still
[27:28] working
[27:32] come on church we get it to disbelieve
[27:35] in God's Word and we'll see why
[27:37] everything today and now it's falling
[27:40] apart because it's working Satan's
[27:50] getting his way see Eve listened to
[28:03] Satan instead of listening to God then
[28:09] we know the literal act applies but now
[28:17] what was that part we'll get a little
[28:20] bit hearing and pick it up later in the
[28:22] message she listened to it now first off
[28:31] just covered a little bit up in the
[28:33] garden and getting them done first all
[28:38] he began to reason with her and she got
[28:40] into her reason abilities and and she
[28:43] got into her position to work that she
[28:47] was preaching to the devil she was the
[28:50] first original woman preacher right now
[28:55] come on it's huge breaks into the devil
[29:00] well because he comes to hurry look and
[29:03] he says oh there's a beautiful garden in
[29:06] here all these trees in the time and
[29:10] said we can defeat of any of these trees
[29:13] and our God has made for us and he's
[29:17] given us this beautiful garden and said
[29:21] we can eat of any of it
[29:25] now he'd done that deliberately he
[29:28] wouldn't know idiot he was bringing her
[29:31] into the position that he wanted her and
[29:33] what did she say let me straighten you
[29:37] out on that we can eat I've ever read
[29:44] this in the garden but said now there's
[29:48] one tree we can't eat other and said
[29:53] that's that tree of knowledge of good
[29:55] and evil and Satan says will now
[30:03] remember you you get the story that's
[30:07] why I said we're trying to lay out a
[30:09] little bit
[30:10] remember the Beast is the one talking to
[30:14] Eve no Ryan
[30:18] it ain't no devil up in the tree right
[30:24] it ain't no snake running around she
[30:29] found somebody she could communicate
[30:31] with she couldn't talk to the other
[30:35] animals because they couldn't talk back
[30:37] to her the Beast was the one that was
[30:40] talking so we look at it it's the devil
[30:44] talking he was through the Beast right
[30:50] so remember so the Beast is saying can
[30:54] we eat it be near these trees oh let me
[30:57] show you and they give you a secret that
[31:00] you don't know did we can eat of all the
[31:04] trees we said now this one tree we can't
[31:09] eat the her preaching was what put her
[31:15] in the wrong line that's why she's not
[31:17] allowed to pull up here one go Satan
[31:25] could get to her and you can still
[31:28] preach him all right
[31:33] but standing there talking to this beast
[31:36] and the Beast says now look what's the
[31:43] problem with the fact that you can't eat
[31:48] now listen remember there was two trees
[31:52] in the garden now there's a whole garden
[31:55] full of trees but there was two trees in
[31:58] a garden and I'm quoting brother branham
[32:01] right when I was a tree of knowledge of
[32:02] good and evil the other ones of the Tree
[32:04] of Life which is Jesus Christ see the
[32:11] beast was saying you mean we can eat any
[32:14] of them with that one said what about
[32:17] this beautiful one over here he says we
[32:23] can eat at that one so he begins to talk
[32:30] too early said well what's wrong with
[32:31] eating this one and she says well I
[32:39] really don't know did is something wrong
[32:45] right here said I was just told that I
[32:51] could eat of every tree go back in
[32:53] Genesis read your Bible and read it and
[32:56] see that I was told by Adam because that
[33:03] would have been the one who've been
[33:04] talking to her their communication which
[33:07] would have been God through Adam no
[33:09] problem right then I was told that we
[33:12] could eat of all the trees with that one
[33:14] we said he didn't explain it to me
[33:25] he said you're poor I'm quoting red
[33:28] right he said your poor little
[33:29] illiterate person did you know that you
[33:35] was made for this I'm quoting brother
[33:37] branham looking at him you want me to
[33:39] read him
[33:42] did you was made for this purpose now
[33:51] listen what was the devil talking
[33:56] through the words of the Beast come on
[34:02] and I'm quoting brother Branham that's
[34:04] what took place so he says he was made
[34:09] for this purpose you was made to be a
[34:13] mother who said they told you that and
[34:29] you know what she was made to be a
[34:33] mother that was her purpose you need him
[34:41] for brother Branham we read around and
[34:43] said she would have brought forth that
[34:45] child that it not got mixed up he said
[34:51] cause that was the commission from God
[34:53] and that's why we read Genesis 1:28 they
[34:58] were told to multiply and replenish the
[35:00] earth
[35:01] but around said she would have finally
[35:04] brought forth that child you said well
[35:07] was it Christ or was it seed ours were
[35:09] you getting you get and that Satan's
[35:12] waiting on your mind then to open up and
[35:15] see then you own when now he don't know
[35:18] what he's talking about because see that
[35:19] didn't anybody bid me in the devil still
[35:22] talking to you brother don't you know
[35:29] what he'd uses a lot of preachers in the
[35:31] pulpit do a lot of talking to
[35:36] but think about it if the original sin
[35:43] was unbelief where was the problem when
[35:50] God had already told him it was a
[35:57] commission set forth and they were made
[36:01] for that purpose she was made for the
[36:10] purpose of being a mother you know
[36:13] already told to multiply and replenish
[36:17] so don't you see what she was telling
[36:20] the beast but I don't understand I don't
[36:26] understand my part could I know I was
[36:31] dire when God said to multiply and
[36:34] replenish I heard that because that was
[36:38] when they were back in theophany in
[36:41] original creation all right she said but
[36:48] I don't understand he said well all you
[36:55] got to do is just listen and I'll
[36:56] explain it to you and he proceeded to
[37:01] explain listen not a sex act there's
[37:09] were the people of the message really
[37:11] they him are good about dad they know
[37:13] all about the Serpent's seat it was not
[37:17] a sex act he's trying to explain it was
[37:20] her ability to be in mother
[37:27] it would her ability to multiply in
[37:30] replenish come on see we look at it in a
[37:38] sex act we look at it and if we look at
[37:40] it as some kind of a date right now you
[37:47] call that worthy you put a little stuff
[37:49] in the drinks and the things you know
[37:51] and it causes these things to happen
[37:56] don't even think about that he was
[38:00] telling her how to fulfill Genesis 1:28
[38:07] and that she was going to have a part to
[38:14] do in that and she said remember not
[38:19] around and said she was seeking wisdom
[38:22] he said that was her trouble said if she
[38:25] did this that turned around her husband
[38:29] come on if she did this turned around
[38:33] when all this was transpiring and walked
[38:38] over her to her husband and said explain
[38:42] this to me they would have never been a
[38:47] fallen condition huh but she didn't
[38:50] won't tell him she's already got the
[38:54] taste of what it was known to have
[38:57] wisdom he said Winston yeah because what
[39:03] did the bee say to Eve the God knows the
[39:09] day you eat thereof you'll be and look
[39:14] at your spelling in that it's a little
[39:17] bit eg OD s did you'll be as God's
[39:20] knowing good and evil you'll know good
[39:30] and evil now they don't let you know
[39:35] who's talking because God now listen to
[39:40] the word
[39:40] 13 God doesn't know good and evil oh but
[39:45] I've got a bob wolf girl you know you go
[39:47] ahead I know where your scriptures that
[39:49] God said I know good and evil and even
[40:00] said I created evil now go ahead see
[40:07] that you're gonna get your smart wisdom
[40:08] involved instead of listening to the
[40:11] statement that I made to start with you
[40:17] remember what I said I said you go into
[40:19] unbelief with what was the statement to
[40:21] start with God can't create anything
[40:25] wrong so how could God create what does
[40:29] that mean when he said I create good and
[40:32] evil come on
[40:37] well he created it you see where you're
[40:44] getting in the Satan's trap and not
[40:47] listening
[40:53] you momentarily agreed while ago that
[40:57] God could not create evil now are you
[41:03] breaking down from that and trying to
[41:07] figure out how he can manipulate things
[41:18] God don't create evil he permits evil to
[41:25] come into existence
[41:27] he doesn't create it so when he's
[41:31] talking about knowing it or even using
[41:33] the word create he's not talking about
[41:36] creating it he's talking about allowing
[41:41] it to be done like I asked the other day
[41:50] why wouldn't it have been that God would
[41:52] have just allowed this to come without a
[41:54] devil and all the temptations what did
[42:00] that look better than the way it is now
[42:03] no because he could not display all of
[42:07] his attributes in listen instead of Eve
[42:16] going back to her husband and saying
[42:19] honey
[42:20] explain that to me come on you're gonna
[42:24] get upset with this one so blowy stack
[42:26] and go like this you know it all blowed
[42:29] out you see cause the church ain't gonna
[42:35] listen to God speaking to them today
[42:39] that original sin is still here you
[42:46] gonna say I can get it myself
[42:48] I didn't write the book
[42:56] I didn't write the five fold ministry
[42:59] which for the perfecting of the science
[43:01] but I've heard that definition defined
[43:03] in many many different ways but it comes
[43:10] right back to one time the fivefold
[43:14] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[43:16] same do you believe that that's the Word
[43:19] of God now I've always told you when I
[43:24] say that one thing and what does it say
[43:26] I agree that the biggest portion of
[43:29] preachers of this message I ain't gonna
[43:32] sit and listen to because they're not
[43:36] trying to perfect the Saints they're
[43:38] trying to destroy the Saints well you
[43:43] think here's what no I've just met I
[43:45] just stopped playing if I got the Bible
[43:52] to read it I just read the Bible yeah
[43:58] but don't you think this oh here you'll
[43:59] see there is your reasoning I told you
[44:02] the star wasn't there whatever was the
[44:06] original sin whatever was the original
[44:09] doing we've got away from it being eaten
[44:14] an apple we got away from it being a
[44:16] setback we got it down we still ain't
[44:19] got that far yet we're still in the
[44:21] basis of even her wisdom and her
[44:25] knowledge and understanding and Satan
[44:28] coming through that room to be able to
[44:33] pervert the church now come on church
[44:38] you think it can't be done I've had to
[44:41] argue with ministers in this message
[44:44] even here in this church about one thing
[44:48] brother Brennan said that little bride
[44:54] went to Nicaea Rome said she should not
[45:00] have went oh I heard definitions they
[45:04] went down there and found out what's
[45:06] wrong and they run back
[45:08] I don't doubt it but you don't want they
[45:12] brought it back that little idea between
[45:15] those two guys that they were arguing
[45:18] over it the first Nazi encounter it is
[45:22] arguing over where Jesus was Almighty
[45:25] God or whether it was a demon God coming
[45:29] into effect which means a lesser God or
[45:31] God in another form or lesser that Jesus
[45:35] was a lesser God and that started your
[45:38] Trinity but the pride went right down to
[45:42] Nicaea and brought that back with her I
[45:45] didn't write the book you want to go
[45:48] through the spoken word I'm just going
[45:50] through a little of it yesterday you
[45:52] want to go through the spoken word where
[45:54] brother Brennan said Adams bride failed
[45:59] but not believe in God's Word he said
[46:04] jehovah's bride fell by not believing
[46:07] God's word he said in Jesus's bride
[46:12] failed by not staying with the word now
[46:19] that's your prophet talking but I just
[46:22] don't think they got into bed wrong they
[46:24] got into wrong enough to they lost they
[46:29] lost this right here this teaching of
[46:33] the stature of a perfect man they lost
[46:37] it they come out with a Trinity
[46:49] Martin Luther was a trinitarian John
[46:51] Wesley a Trinitarian Pentecostal
[46:54] beginnings of Azusa Street was
[46:57] trinitarianism you got to get over about
[47:02] 1914 and all to get the one that started
[47:05] then you got to come home to word can
[47:07] pick up the name of Jesus through that
[47:11] you say oh well we can't be deceived
[47:15] I've got the quote part we can't be
[47:19] deceived we can never be deceived enough
[47:21] to be lost if we're truly born again but
[47:24] if we're truly born again what are we
[47:25] playing with the wrong time why are we
[47:32] in the garden trying to tell the beast
[47:34] oh I don't understand that
[47:40] do you understand one thing why are we
[47:44] still thinking that we can figure this
[47:46] thing out for ourselves why have we been
[47:49] here 50 years talk all you want I said
[47:54] it 50 years ago and I still say it today
[47:57] you know what the problem is me in you
[48:06] well we use a lot of types and shatters
[48:08] don't with Moses went down to Egypt to
[48:13] get the children of Israel take him out
[48:15] he couldn't do it he had to wait 40
[48:17] years till God had to come on the scene
[48:20] mighty ways to bring him out who's God
[48:25] waiting on the people whose God been
[48:28] waiting on in these last days the people
[48:32] to believe his word my brother I got
[48:40] right now there's the one thing that
[48:43] your prophet tells you in a hurry that
[48:46] that's the wrong attitude we don't have
[48:51] no rocks
[48:52] we are sheep they do not have a right to
[48:57] believe what we want to believe and
[49:01] what's wrong with it's not believing it
[49:03] the way God says it still in the mind of
[49:09] Eve talking right in the devil telling
[49:13] her you was made you was made different
[49:21] than Adam he was very different
[49:29] he said look I hear in the animal
[49:31] kingdom
[49:32] I said look look at the female they know
[49:42] their purpose in time this is what you
[49:49] don't know you're Adams kept that from
[49:54] you if she was made to be a woman I told
[50:05] you son dealer to me now you come and do
[50:08] whatever you want to we'll talk all you
[50:11] want to talk well we're gonna come back
[50:12] in one statement she was made to be a
[50:15] woman anything else you add into that is
[50:20] going to be your hypothetical when you
[50:23] call those big o words so nice not
[50:25] possessor know what it is and then word
[50:27] your assumptions and your ideas and your
[50:29] thoughts because if you do with any
[50:33] other thing than the fact that she was
[50:36] made of feminists that's natural we know
[50:39] that happened and that feminist part
[50:42] goes to the mother
[50:50] she was born in a way every little girl
[50:55] she plays with her dolls no we've got
[51:03] him nowadays until we kept on and kept
[51:05] on and kept on and now the kids don't
[51:06] know which side to play with and they
[51:08] don't know what kind of toys to buy but
[51:11] I'll tell you one thing you do if you'll
[51:14] just listen and do it let that get kid
[51:17] get about two years old and turn them
[51:21] loose in a store because they ain't got
[51:24] trained yet the people think got it all
[51:27] messed up yet in their mind you're given
[51:30] by two years old you turn that little
[51:32] girl loose you hear that doll this is
[51:33] straight as can be you turn that little
[51:36] boy loose he'll head to that car you

[51:40] in the yard why does it little boy take
[51:46] a car go ain't never drove a car he
[51:58] don't know what it's all about
[52:00] but he rode him little Lin if you'd have
[52:05] been back in our day you know what we
[52:07] had to play with
[52:09] we took a can lad you know the inner
[52:12] part and drove a nail into a stick and
[52:16] we like that was our little cars because
[52:20] we didn't have nothing else I hope you
[52:23] get what I mean
[52:25] after two or three years of age and
[52:27] things start manipulating and changing
[52:30] and doing and you're responsible to
[52:33] raise them children rock what am I gonna
[52:39] tell my kid not told you Sunday just
[52:41] listening you don't screaming holler
[52:44] that little girl don't you play with
[52:45] them toys like that we're boys don't
[52:48] worry about it just let them be a little
[52:52] girl I just put a little doll in the
[52:55] bedroom with a map y'all
[53:00] made to be a mother what was the
[53:05] difference in Eve's and Adam Adam was
[53:16] made to be a man Eve was made to be a
[53:21] woman now you tell me any other
[53:25] characteristics are defects that is
[53:29] brought upon that and trying to convince
[53:33] me of the the things of this and that
[53:36] the hot natures and the things and you
[53:39] getting all of your doings just start
[53:47] him off as a baby and listen with that
[53:57] beast he kept talking and he said this
[54:04] tree of knowledge that's a funny-looking
[54:07] tree in I mean whether you want to call
[54:09] it a power peach or whatever
[54:10] he's a funny-looking tree because the
[54:13] Bible does it it's listed two times I
[54:15] fight for the tree of knowledge what
[54:18] kind of tree is that what kind of tree
[54:23] is the tree of knowledge we used to tell
[54:27] the kids all about that we had a tree
[54:31] that grows persimmons and you could eat
[54:36] them so one day we was walking through
[54:43] the woods it was real early in the year
[54:48] and they said daddy what kind of tree is
[54:51] that I said that's a personal injury
[54:54] that is that the kind you said we could
[54:57] eat I said help yourself they wouldn't
[55:04] write yet so you know I'm talking about
[55:06] a real bitter but when they bit down and
[55:10] spitting and throw it at me I said
[55:12] I tell you one thing you got a way to
[55:14] get right then they got away they fall
[55:16] off on the ground and they were hanging
[55:19] else but had they're edible you know
[55:24] what are you saying
[55:26] sometimes it takes a lesson to learn
[55:30] right
[55:31] takes a lesson to learn you wouldn't get
[55:36] him to take when them hurt someone's off
[55:40] that tree no right now you said what are
[55:46] you getting that brother Dale I'm
[55:47] getting it one time the tree of
[55:51] knowledge of good and evil do you
[55:56] realize what that would mean if it's a
[55:59] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[56:01] it would mean there was enough good in
[56:06] it to be good
[56:09] see if good but there's enough in it
[56:13] evil to kill you and see that was what
[56:19] happened in the garden
[56:21] when that be said you'll be as God's
[56:24] knowing good and evil
[56:30] yeah I never have been like a lot of I
[56:32] never believed that the garden of act
[56:35] was over a five minute period I don't
[56:39] there's no telling how long that
[56:42] situation took like her to come out the
[56:48] way it did but get the point
[56:52] the devil's inroad to Eve was one time
[56:56] you were made for this purpose as I said
[57:08] now do you want him got him here brother
[57:10] branham said it was an oncoming
[57:16] commission from God to multiply and
[57:20] replenish
[57:21] I said it would have taken place so what
[57:28] was the devil doing
[57:31] he wouldn't preach you know three-guard
[57:33] situation to Eve he was preaching to her
[57:39] how that she would be like God so what
[57:47] is the original sin unbelief unbelief
[57:56] but look how close the devil is Eve was
[58:01] made for the purpose of reproduction she
[58:09] was made and had the understanding while
[58:13] in Adam that there was to be a
[58:16] multiplication made multiply and
[58:23] replenish the earth and don't run Claver
[58:25] see that's where people do that you get
[58:27] into a message and I watch you it'll you
[58:29] know you say the Bible says multiply and
[58:31] replenish and the rest of the message
[58:34] you heard nothing about what I'm talking
[58:35] about multiplying all you hung on
[58:38] replenish they must have been a world
[58:41] before this world I heard that before
[58:43] there was probably people before this
[58:45] world and then that they got wiped out
[58:48] and when they got wiped out then God
[58:49] told Adam and Eve to replenish you have
[58:56] never heard preachers in this message
[58:58] talked about there must have been a
[59:01] pre-adamic people that existed before
[59:05] Adam and Eve maybe you don't listen
[59:13] what's being saying you need to listen
[59:17] real careful because your soul is
[59:19] involved
[59:26] you see how easy it was for Satan then
[59:29] to make his inroad into the human race
[59:33] was to explain to Eve the truth of the
[59:38] word of God of what she was made for to
[59:48] explain what she was made for pretty
[59:53] good preacher ain't no trinitarian you
[59:57] know what I mean by that don't you he
[59:59] ain't that far off he's later he's
[1:00:03] laying pretty good on the word but just
[1:00:09] remember the regional statement I made
[1:00:12] was what that original sin is still
[1:00:17] right here now he said whatever but
[1:00:31] brother Taylor I'm a firm believer in
[1:00:32] the word of God it is amen
[1:00:38] but just think
[1:00:43] if you eat of the tree of knowledge of
[1:00:45] good and evil
[1:00:46] what would you come out with you would
[1:00:51] come out with a knowledge of good and
[1:00:54] evil acceptable I needed define that
[1:01:01] statement if you eat of the tree of
[1:01:04] knowledge of good and evil you're gonna
[1:01:06] come out with a knowledge of good and
[1:01:08] evil but if you eat of the Tree of Life
[1:01:14] you're gonna come out with a life of
[1:01:16] Almighty God right see they could eat of
[1:01:24] every tree but the tree of knowledge of
[1:01:29] good and evil so the tree was in the
[1:01:35] Garden of Life right why didn't he go to
[1:01:38] the Tree of Life Becca what is the Tree
[1:01:46] of Life the Word of God well I mean that
[1:01:48] sensor will bring it all the way down
[1:01:49] dogs and everything he comes down to the
[1:01:52] Word of God huh see Satan was not trying
[1:01:58] to get Eve to doubt that God said what
[1:02:03] he said and things but he was trying to
[1:02:08] get her to see that he was not going to
[1:02:12] kill her
[1:02:21] just because you were brought for that
[1:02:23] purpose Satan says you shall surely die
[1:02:31] but what'd she say I mean she said you
[1:02:38] will die for he that Satan said what you
[1:02:42] shall not die because you'll have a
[1:02:46] great revelation now isn't that what
[1:02:50] people of this message is trying to do
[1:02:53] it's on the message wisdom versus faith
[1:02:55] brethren said talking about even he says
[1:02:59] God made you for a purpose to be a
[1:03:05] mother what about it then what went
[1:03:14] wrong the way she became a mother right
[1:03:23] the way she became a mother she accepted
[1:03:31] Satan's lie perverting her spiritual
[1:03:37] part of her whether you want to call it
[1:03:39] shoulder spirit or whatever you called
[1:03:40] it back in the early parts of the
[1:03:42] message he got hurt the reason we know
[1:03:48] what realm that sets in the second realm
[1:03:51] of mankind he got hurt to reason about
[1:03:56] the word and remember the reasoning
[1:04:04] wasn't that far off look how close it
[1:04:10] was
[1:04:12] he said Eve you remember you were told
[1:04:17] to multiply and replenish I'm just
[1:04:21] trying to tell you how that's to be done
[1:04:33] what has been the goal and thoughts of
[1:04:36] mankind is it not true that all mankind
[1:04:43] even denominations and everything they
[1:04:47] speak of a God in a reality and Christ
[1:04:52] coming and living in us and you know to
[1:04:55] make us Christians and become a good
[1:04:58] people and have God's nature and ways
[1:05:01] about us isn't that the goal of all
[1:05:12] Christianity is anything wrong with that
[1:05:18] this coordinate how you go about it
[1:05:21] right so he said you were made to be a
[1:05:26] mother and brother Brennan said the
[1:05:30] spoke words of reading a seat
[1:05:32] she would have finally done it that she
[1:05:39] not accepted Satan's lie what was his
[1:05:46] lie now multiply and replenish you were
[1:05:54] made for this purpose ain't ladder yet
[1:06:03] right everything he was saying was right
[1:06:17] so he said okay I was made for this
[1:06:25] purpose I hope you listen to this with
[1:06:30] the right attitude so she goes home
[1:06:38] toaster Iseman and she begins to tell
[1:06:46] him about the things that were coming to
[1:06:51] her she just didn't reveal the source
[1:06:54] you know maybe but she began to talk to
[1:06:58] him and she says Adam was I made to be a
[1:07:03] mother he says yes honey that's the word
[1:07:11] woman did you've made to be a mother
[1:07:16] cause you a woman she said well he's
[1:07:25] anything else said I'm getting these
[1:07:29] doubts about that I can remember back
[1:07:33] when we were in theophany and we were
[1:07:37] told to multiply and replenish the earth
[1:07:46] and him says yes
[1:07:52] yes but he said it's not time yet
[1:08:05] it's not time yet
[1:08:10] that was the worst thing in the world a
[1:08:12] tailor woman
[1:08:21] because she's gonna beat you to death to
[1:08:24] try to get out of you what you talking
[1:08:26] about right she's gonna Burton you she's
[1:08:32] gonna worry you what do you mean we used
[1:08:38] to had a brother went to church here and
[1:08:40] all you had to do was just say something
[1:08:43] to him and turn around say oh that's all
[1:08:44] right forget it I'll explain it later
[1:08:47] he'd stay with you all day you know all
[1:08:49] night do you explain what you're talking
[1:08:52] about
[1:08:54] no so Eve she has nobody else to talk to
[1:09:03] no she talked to the animals that
[1:09:08] couldn't know next day she goes back to
[1:09:14] the Beast and says he said what took
[1:09:17] place he said I explained these times
[1:09:19] but said all that him said it wasn't
[1:09:23] time yet he said see that tolki they're
[1:09:29] trying to keep it from you you were made
[1:09:34] for it and God said if you do it now why
[1:09:37] don't you get on with it
[1:09:48] he got her to reason what's wrong with
[1:09:56] the church today is they've come to a
[1:10:03] place that I have a head knowledge of
[1:10:07] the understanding of the Prophet
[1:10:14] anything wrong with that no they come to
[1:10:21] the point of understanding and have the
[1:10:25] ability to explain a lot of things and
[1:10:29] they wrong with that no the only wrong
[1:10:38] in the garden was she took the wrong
[1:10:40] mate now come on tell me if I'm wrong
[1:10:47] there was nothing wrong with what he was
[1:10:49] saying to her he was quoting the word to
[1:10:53] her you were made for this purpose and
[1:10:57] God told you to do it wrong mate now
[1:11:05] quote brother Branham he said every time
[1:11:08] you get together and you mention knives
[1:11:09] and divorce if you only read I said
[1:11:16] every time imagine divorce is mentioned
[1:11:18] and it always goes back to the original
[1:11:21] see him this it's in the marriage and
[1:11:27] divorce he said any time that would come
[1:11:30] up the religious realm he said it goes
[1:11:33] back to the original sin in other words
[1:11:36] man can't order know what happened in
[1:11:38] the garden because see he had to first
[1:11:45] get the inroad into her mind which was
[1:11:48] the wound her inner being was through
[1:11:51] her brain and got her to think about it
[1:11:59] come on church he got you only go with
[1:12:03] the wrong thing didn't I get in trouble
[1:12:04] trying to explain it he wasn't trying to
[1:12:08] tell her how hot natured she was and all
[1:12:10] of those things like that I'm not
[1:12:14] talking that way and I've never preached
[1:12:16] that away that took place is it
[1:12:22] progressed in the act but the first
[1:12:29] thing was for her to listen to him
[1:12:33] reasoning to her about how she was made
[1:12:38] and what she was doing and all of these
[1:12:40] things and he was telling her the truth
[1:12:53] he was telling her
[1:13:02] you're a by-product
[1:13:10] so they'll tell you some other story the
[1:13:14] bees talking to you too because in the
[1:13:17] animal kingdom that God created male and
[1:13:23] female but said in the human realm
[1:13:37] did you was in Adam and listen you can't
[1:13:43] be deceived you are part of Adam it said
[1:13:58] that being you being a by-product that
[1:14:05] didn't make her no different than Adam
[1:14:09] that's what I'm trying my best to lay
[1:14:11] down a story to you to get you away from
[1:14:14] all of these flames and flying's that
[1:14:16] goes said you were made beautiful
[1:14:23] perfect you were made everything exactly
[1:14:27] correct because you were made out of
[1:14:30] Adam and said you're a by-product of
[1:14:33] Adam that's not a sinful state to be a
[1:14:36] by-product I hope you'll get that out of
[1:14:39] your mind eventually Co by-product
[1:14:44] exactly to be a product of a product
[1:14:45] whatever the regional product was you're
[1:14:47] a product of that he was a part of adam
[1:14:52] or unfit she's part of him in theophany
[1:14:56] he said she was part of him in the
[1:14:59] original creation so the devil's giving
[1:15:05] her another day or two through the Beast
[1:15:09] to talk to her about the word and he's
[1:15:15] telling her the truth that's the one
[1:15:22] thing I'm trying to get you to see if
[1:15:24] you don't see nothing else we think the
[1:15:29] devil is just a big old liar you know
[1:15:37] he's so shrewd and so perfect
[1:15:41] he uses the word of God to try to preach
[1:15:47] to you he doesn't have all kind of books
[1:15:52] and things to throw away
[1:15:53] he uses the Word of God the church
[1:16:03] that's why we better listen to what's
[1:16:05] being said we're in the last days we all
[1:16:09] talked about life days and the ending up
[1:16:11] of all things we better start listening
[1:16:14] get serious about our listening and be
[1:16:18] concerned because remember the devil
[1:16:22] he's not going to come to you and try to
[1:16:24] tell you a lie that just goes the way
[1:16:26] off he's gonna tell you 99.99% truth
[1:16:34] what was wrong in the garden wrong mate
[1:16:42] wrong mate
[1:16:49] I didn't write the book I got him here
[1:16:53] if you want me to read them to you
[1:16:54] butter brown who said she would have
[1:16:56] brought forth that child but said she
[1:17:00] couldn't wait he said she's just like
[1:17:03] sport original she said she's just like
[1:17:05] the church today says they can't wait i
[1:17:12] watch these young men and you know I've
[1:17:14] told you over and over and over I watch
[1:17:17] these young men come into the message to
[1:17:18] know their own fire their fireball and
[1:17:20] their preaching everybody just glory
[1:17:22] gifts right in there with them and
[1:17:24] everything you know and they're just
[1:17:25] really going I said just leave him alone
[1:17:28] I said just 40 years ago I said just
[1:17:35] leave him alone
[1:17:36] I said coach that go wonder how they're
[1:17:42] gonna wind down and that's what they've
[1:17:46] done the great fireballs of yesteryears
[1:17:51] they've window with the little bride
[1:17:59] she's supposed to just stay right with
[1:18:00] that word the devil comes and talks to
[1:18:05] her just say well in other words he
[1:18:12] comes and tries to tell you some defect
[1:18:16] that Eve was created with just say but
[1:18:20] God can't create anything wrong then you
[1:18:26] watch them turn around and leave you
[1:18:29] just remember that the Beast is who's
[1:18:32] talking to you huh well we don't like
[1:18:38] that you calling them preachers beasts
[1:18:41] I'm calling all those preachers beasts
[1:18:43] that won't stay with the Word of God
[1:18:46] I put myself you everybody else into
[1:18:48] that one category if we don't stay with
[1:18:51] God's Word we are no different and the
[1:18:53] beast was in the garden we're just
[1:18:55] trying our way some way to get to the
[1:18:57] feminine get to the feminist part of the
[1:19:00] Bride of Christ to get her deceived in
[1:19:02] believing what we're talking about and
[1:19:08] what's plainer do you want
[1:19:11] you better know I said this forty some
[1:19:13] years ago if you don't know where you
[1:19:16] stand
[1:19:16] Satan's gonna get you and he said 40
[1:19:24] years to do a pretty good job of a lot
[1:19:28] of the people of this message what about
[1:19:33] it what about the fall that's always
[1:19:39] gonna be explained to all of these
[1:19:40] cretins the fall was for Eve to
[1:19:46] disbelieve God's Word then I explained
[1:19:54] that it wasn't that she wasn't lady she
[1:19:56] was made for that purpose she was made
[1:19:59] to multiply and replenish she was made
[1:20:01] all of those things the devil wasn't
[1:20:03] lying to her he was telling her the
[1:20:05] truth
[1:20:06] that's what caught her no we can see
[1:20:16] it's a literal act I preached it 47
[1:20:19] years ago and I still preach it now the
[1:20:22] first end road to any woman is through
[1:20:24] her brain you think it ain't right where
[1:20:28] woman's a thousand times more either be
[1:20:31] deceived and you don't know women you
[1:20:32] don't know I know we're not against
[1:20:34] women I've always defended it and been
[1:20:36] standing on it so I don't have to deny
[1:20:37] about and say anything other than one
[1:20:39] thing the bride of Jesus Christ if she
[1:20:51] don't stay with God's Word she will be
[1:20:56] deceived
[1:21:01] it was told in the Word of God that this
[1:21:06] would take place that would take place
[1:21:08] the ages would come the bride would go
[1:21:10] into the ground all of these things
[1:21:12] would transpire right it was told in the
[1:21:15] Word of God before it ever happened
[1:21:17] we was also told in the Word of God that
[1:21:20] they'd be a bride that would stand only
[1:21:23] on the word and wouldn't listen to
[1:21:28] Satan's lie
[1:21:29] no matter Satan's lies telling her 99%
[1:21:32] truth all it takes is one percent what
[1:21:43] about it what was what is the follow to
[1:21:46] you it's to disbelieve God's Word the
[1:21:55] original sin not to sex act that took
[1:22:01] place because of the original sin that
[1:22:03] are already protrude / I went through
[1:22:05] her to beat her being and brought her to
[1:22:07] a position I know I shouldn't maybe say
[1:22:19] things but
[1:22:25] all of you know one thing for sure you
[1:22:33] know how you're made and what you made
[1:22:35] of and you know what all of that is
[1:22:40] about but why can't we put it in the
[1:22:46] right room and talk about Jesus Christ
[1:22:53] in His Church as husband and wife then
[1:23:00] we'll lose all of our thoughts of any
[1:23:02] kind of wrong things I've always said to
[1:23:08] you there's always been a life we always
[1:23:10] do about it but you just let said the
[1:23:17] other day you come in from work and
[1:23:19] there are you come in something and you
[1:23:20] start bragging on your wife how pretty
[1:23:22] she is and how she looks so good and and
[1:23:25] everything like that happening and man
[1:23:27] everything that's wonderful she loves to
[1:23:31] hear those time yeah why because she's a
[1:23:37] woman they don't matter but old man oh
[1:23:45] not me bowling at everything but just
[1:23:53] remember one time whatever you call the
[1:23:56] fall and what took place it's still
[1:23:59] taking place today right he said yeah
[1:24:07] but we're not in the Daltrey like Eve
[1:24:09] was we're in the worst kind of called
[1:24:15] spiritual adultery to not believe what
[1:24:19] the prophet of god has told us his
[1:24:23] spiritual adultery I listen to him
[1:24:28] screaming in the holler and I thank God
[1:24:31] I'm sure I'm glad you didn't choose me
[1:24:34] for that
[1:24:38] but yet he's saying it with a heart of
[1:24:41] love and compassion that he's trying his
[1:24:46] best to get two people to realize who
[1:24:48] they are and what they're taking place
[1:24:53] because you see the reason I keep
[1:24:56] titling the message one God series has
[1:25:04] been 25 messages that's the title look
[1:25:08] on the Internet is one God series in it
[1:25:10] is a subtitle reason I'm doing that cuz
[1:25:12] I ain't finished yet were the Godhead
[1:25:17] because if you're part of the Godhead
[1:25:19] and God ain't complete without you then
[1:25:21] there's more to be done in this day but
[1:25:26] it's not Satan with his perverted little
[1:25:28] flings of telling you how great you are
[1:25:30] and make it sometimes he has to tell us
[1:25:33] to sit down shut up and listen right but
[1:25:44] he's doing it with a heart of love come
[1:25:47] on Rosa he's doing it with love from a
[1:25:49] place that is beyond all love of mankind
[1:25:59] think on these things well I just don't
[1:26:05] understand you brother Dale because you
[1:26:06] the way you preach and you do no it's
[1:26:10] you're not wanting to understand just
[1:26:14] sit down and listen and think just think
[1:26:21] about you
[1:26:26] think about you and your life and where
[1:26:28] you came from is what's been in your
[1:26:29] life and you'll see and realize what God
[1:26:35] has been doing for us well we got rid of
[1:26:42] let's team
[1:26:44] what is the fall unbelief
[1:26:49] what is the original sin unbelief
[1:26:52] unbelief comes before anything else of
[1:26:56] natural points you talk about but Arun
[1:27:03] said before a woman can receive a man
[1:27:05] says she's got to receive him in her in
[1:27:10] her being if that ain't enough to let us
[1:27:16] know all of life and what's going on I
[1:27:19] hope you caught one thing I ain't wanted
[1:27:21] hammers this is I'm trying to get you to
[1:27:24] see the devil wouldn't tell in so much
[1:27:25] of the lies people tell to hear he was
[1:27:27] telling 99.99 percent true he just
[1:27:31] didn't tell her who that act was to take
[1:27:32] place with if he'd have turned to her
[1:27:38] and said go back to Adam that he wasn't
[1:27:43] gonna do that but he left her to reason
[1:27:48] go ahead well we got 116
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:58] stole I would save you came from glory
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:07] how about anybody have a need so you let
[1:28:11] them get caught up in the basis of
[1:28:12] realizing you know her thousand thing
[1:28:15] well we can't be deceived if we ever get
[1:28:21] to thought we can't be deceive remember
[1:28:23] that is the deception
[1:28:28] yeah but the Bible said we can't be to
[1:28:31] see right because if your true bride
[1:28:34] you're gonna wake up one day one day the
[1:28:40] bride is gonna wake up to who she really
[1:28:42] is what's going on that's when she's
[1:28:47] going out of here
[1:28:52] you see we got it all figured out we
[1:28:55] know the quote
[1:28:57] like I say another day you mentioned
[1:29:01] revival to people to mention bad no more
[1:29:04] revivals revival Dover I've got the word
[1:29:10] the profit yeah but you ain't got all
[1:29:13] the words of the program when he gets in
[1:29:17] the silve ugh and he says the bride
[1:29:19] ain't had no revival yet did it take in
[1:29:23] seven unknown thunders to wake her up
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:29] we're not fighting quotes they're not a
[1:29:32] worldwide revival coming no there's not
[1:29:36] a one the next worldwide system like
[1:29:38] that is two witnesses to the Jews but
[1:29:41] why can't we have a revival in our
[1:29:44] hearts and lives when the word is
[1:29:46] preached to us why can't we rejoice and
[1:29:51] say lord thank you for the revival that
[1:29:54] I have in my heart
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:03] I've told you over and over it's been a
[1:30:05] revival in my heart ever since I heard
[1:30:07] the Prophet first dolphin
[1:30:11] why because I heard a man at no what are
[1:30:15] you talking about
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:20] and it put me to the place that I wanted
[1:30:23] to know what he taught
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:27] not the kind of a head knowledge but a
[1:30:31] revelation come into my heart and change
[1:30:36] my being to be what he wants me to be
[1:30:41] what about it
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:47] original unbelief is still here now
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:56] what is it is it scripture I know the
[1:30:59] probably quoted did lord help down my
[1:31:01] unbelief
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:07] I remember preaching the message one
[1:31:08] time brother Moe said well I never
[1:31:10] noticed that Scripture
[1:31:11] the Bible speaks of and said will the
[1:31:14] Lord find faith when the Son of Man
[1:31:18] comes
[1:31:20] that's the question
[1:31:23] said will the Lord find faith
[1:31:29] we know he will why cause he promised it
[1:31:34] he's gonna have a bride cuz he promised
[1:31:37] it there's going to be a rapture cause
[1:31:39] he promised it there is a revival in the
[1:31:44] hearts with the Bride of Christ
[1:31:46] he promised it now he's doing it
[1:31:51] one more before we go to 51
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:32:12] and
[1:32:14] [Music]
