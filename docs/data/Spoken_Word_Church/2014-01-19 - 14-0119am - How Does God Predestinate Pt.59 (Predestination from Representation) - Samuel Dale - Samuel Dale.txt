foreign to see amen and amen and amen I want to see him it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning your scripture turn where we've been reading in Romans eight and then we'll go to Ephesians 1 Romans 8 Ephesians 1. we had a real good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting safe trip over there and back it was a good trip so we just appreciate everybody praying you know just remember each one remember Wade is over in South Carolina preaching today and remember brother dick and sister Gail were on vacation uh they're out on a cruise trip there and I told him last night that if brother dick got out there and got to talking a whole lot they might have a Jonah you know so we'll pray for him he don't try to convert the captain maybe because he might try to throw him overboard and not not making light just point but just remember that I think sister Freda her sister is sick I don't know remember her she was requesting it last night and I just happened to write it down um and doing it also on February the 5th which is a Wednesday brother Forney will be with us preaching on that Wednesday so that'll be February the 5th remember the announcements that were made of the banquet that's coming up and we've tried to make this a banquet open more this time but we still are requiring that it be adults to come you know all right and in that then uh you know we do need some children or you know young people to uh you know little bitty ones you know but young teenagers to be servers and things like that and if you would like to come and be a server and Alden let us know we'll try to work it all in to see how many uh you know what we've got and things okay Nanny's done got the service okay done taken care of all right she's always Johnny on the spot doing anything else I always miss something Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us we thank you for the day that we have because Lord we truly believe that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and we believe that we've gathered this day for that purpose that you would speak to our hearts and reveal yourself unto us Lord forgive our sins guide us in your loving grace be with Wade there as he's administering this morning just be with him and father just bless each one you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us that we just remind you of that Lord and father the promises are yea and amen so as we speak the word you come and override to human inabilities that we have and be able to speak enough to do as a prophet said to maybe break the spell over the people's eyes that Satan has placed our and be able to allow you to speak to our hearts we love you and we thank you we ask you to just bless us and forgive us and keep us in Jesus name amen Romans 8. 28. we'll try this afternoon if we can get through to have questions and answers you know or questions comments Etc uh this afternoon so you'd be thinking about it and uh you know getting everything ready we'll try to have that this afternoon I hope to bring this to a conclusion as say the the study we've been making but yet not bring it to an end as to all things because what we'll do is we'll wind up oh picking there's some points that I've covered a little bit that I want to go back and cover all right and you know in doings and some separate sermons and things like that okay pray at the Lord would bless us Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did now once did already predestinate them he also already called in whom he called them he also already finished Justified in whom he justified then he also glorified as far as God is concerned it's all past tense right so then if we ever get the revelation of what it is then we convert very easily take the next verse what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen let's go over to Ephesians 1. verse 1 Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at emphasis and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ and watch according as he hath chosen Us in him that did he choose us and just pick us out no it's chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we see should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us I got these circles but I like that that's to me you know having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made what US accepted in the blood in whom we have Redemption through his blood to forgiveness of sins that according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us right the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself then in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now remember chosen in him now you're going to bring everything is coming into his captivity right in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work of all things after the counsel of his own will that we right should be to should be to the praise of his glory which first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted what after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise with that excuse me that notice it I don't know whether only one of them which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're predestinated unto the point of full inheritance right okay now I've been speaking and I said I want to try to bring it to a kind of a conclusion this morning and all but I won't end all of it I will pick some points and go back through and you be sure and have your questions for this afternoon turn them in or we will have open discussion now I believe to understand the way that the Bible would speak that we were chosen in him that uh not chosen of him but chosen in him all right then to understand the prophet and his way of speaking of a of a seed being in you and you were born with a seed in you and could even call those things eternal life and say if you have eternal life you always was eternal well now that's not you and I God first off we had to be chosen right second off there's only one eternal and that's his own life all right so then we we can understand and follow to me I wrote it down the other day like this to me this is the key of understanding is this statement I tried the things I tried to bring out Wednesday trying to preach that God will not dwell in an unclean vessel see people believe they come into the world with eternal life in them within where was God dwelling that's all I'm asking I'm you know I don't like to be a smart alec I've been labeled one I'm not very smart so I guess I might be an addict whatever how you want to Define that but I've tried my best for 40 something years to preach when I believe is the truth of the hour and I've tried to take even a lot of things that were seemingly in the message that sounded contradictory and I've tried my you know tried to yield myself to the Lord to get an answer and to this day he has never failed me to give me an answer about things you know that would be questionable as we look at it and read uh you know we were going to a Minister's meeting one time on marriage and divorce you've heard me tell of it and I'd always been concerned about during Deuteronomy where it talks about that uh you know a man finding someone cleaning his wife and he put her away and uh you know and things like that and he said she can or may or whatever is using during the terminologies it sounds exactly like God said it's okay for her to go get married again you know the wet sounds well that's what they brought up when we got to the ministers meeting well I was honest and praying and I do when I seek this out I I lay before him I don't try to figure it out I try to wait for him to answer it and it was over in the corner here praying before we left and the Lord showed me what that scripture was he's not okay in it he's just saying she will he's not saying it's okay for her to do it he's saying she will do it all right and uh see that I've always done that and that's why that I can stand the day and say that you know out on the internet systems it never were if I'm wrong come and show me because I want to be right this is not a thing of uh building a kingdom I got so tickled we they gave us a I think Hannah was the one that bought it or something or got him for her daddy but we were viewing the uh video the other day which talked about how that the men that made America and is talking about uh Rockefeller and uh you know Morgan and and uh the different ones like that that were the super rich you know well when I finished up I began to kind of laugh and looked over at my wife and she'd you know we do that a lot we take naps sometimes when we doing things and when she woke up I said honey you missed the best part then what the especially Rockefeller and Morgan when they got down in their old age coming to the end of the life maybe some of you seen the video about it so their concern was the hereafter so they figured if they gave away ever a lot here they might get Hereafter you know and they said Rockefeller equivalent to this day is money that was you know 1890s 1900s somewhere thereabouts it'd be equivalent to him giving away over a hundred billion dollars to Charities and things he trying to pay his way into heaven go these scene he wouldn't go nowhere without he wasn't going to start new companies he better be concerned about you know Hereafter well you know that's me I'm not concerned with anything here I'm concerned with a hereafter all right I hope you are because that's what we better be concerned with is the things of doing you know but I'm just I've always just tried to be honest and say okay if I'm wrong come and show me because if I am wrong and I have the Holy Ghost I will take correction but if I'm not wrong then I'm not going to belittle you because you don't believe what I believe because I really remember one thing the scripture said all you have you received you didn't get it yourself you received it and I'm a firm believer in faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and I've asked you over and over and I've asked the people of the message they say we come here with this eternal seat I believe what brother random is talking about but I asked a simple question the new birth is it the birth that once you come here with versus the birth of what you got after you got here by faith that you heard that's all I've asked simple questions but see people don't want to no that's this question gender Strife we want to preach it you know okay praise the Lord I'm just going down the road you know I ain't worried about it but you see Church I believe that God will not dwell in an unclean vessel I believe he spent too much time in the Bible declaring how those vessels must be clean how they must be washed even burnout or whatever you know we'd get down to brother Branham so if the Bible and brother Reynolds spent a lot of talking about unclean vessels not being used then how can you put eternal life inside the soul of an individual that is lost all right but I made my point over and over and over to you just as we read from the prophet hey not to your own understanding excuse me now wait a minute the invisible Union where he said the seed of God can't be in you at the same time the world is there but see we don't want those quotes we want to think about something dire and then you start thinking about whale he loved me and he put it there and I'm anointed praise the Lord like I was telling them last night coming home and remember the incident that happened where this brother made a remark about somebody well see his discernment could have picked that up but I told him he was wrong because even though his discernment might have been close first off he didn't have sensible use of it but second off it wasn't correct we see Church we can be so anointed so you know until nobody's going to be able to help us was that what the prophet said on that note that not I believe it is about the little woman he said you couldn't tell her wrong to do them thing why I said oh she's anointed well you know you say well you don't believe in being a I believe we must be anointed I believe the anointing is what teaches us but remember anointing on your spirit as the prophet has covered anointed ones is a hard situation to let him teach us but I believe in the true genuine anointing don't you Brother Dean gave me a quote while ago that I'll just read one of them to you about that where brother Brown says on a message called having conferences 1960 608 so you say let's let the preacher do it what a lot of people think right he said this is an individual of Fire it is with every one of us the preacher must do his part he might pray and get his soul blessed and stay all afternoon under the anointing of the Holy Spirit to walk into the presence of his congregation anointed feeling the power of God but unless that congregation has stayed in the same way it makes a difference he's got to get the congregation under condition but then if the congregation is ready to meet the Holy Spirit then I'll tell you Sinners will whip their way to Calvary if we can just if we can just take it as an individual you're just as responsible as any of these ministers God's going to hold you as an individual responsible right what did the prophet say one person in a congregation caused a whole congregation to fail and all that takes is just a bad attitude brother way you remember presented brother random saying something amen right and he died but see we don't think about that of the days when it come that the center won't be able to sit in the congregation of the righteous we don't think that away we think we're so holy and and everything until we've got it all right but now listen my point I've tried to make is one thing if we make the seed of God we know the seed of God is the word of God right we know in Matthew that a story went forth and so deceived well now brother Randall would say it what see we we say when we come into the world with a seed in it I believe what he's saying I just don't believe what our people's interpretation is of it well I said what he said yeah and in Matthew 28 19. it says for you to go baptize in the name of the father and it was done and the Holy Ghost right that's what the Bible says and you know we've done that from the time the Catholic Church picked it up and injected it but you know then we found out the prophet said the only way you can be baptized in the name of the father and the son the Holy Ghost is to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ did that erase the scripture no we believed hell was eternal when we had scripture for it the worm died not burn Everlasting we had it all figured out the prophet didn't change the Bible he just told us that wasn't correct you see it was a lot of things in the message and instead of taking all that said like I said Wednesday night about Daniel 70 weeks what Serena high for seven and one is this but instead of letting the Holy Spirit speak to us we get what we believe or what Nanny believed or granny believed or preacher believed or somebody believed and we stand on it that away so is it with talking about the seed dwelling in US we've been told that we come here with a seed in US well all right as the prophet asked a simple question remember when was that seed put in you well what do you mean it putting me when I was born no he didn't say that he said it was put in you before the foundation world well all right what part or what is it of anything of you and I before the foundation of the world when the prophet said we wasn't even spirits there was nothing that was only in his mind we were just in his thinking he said he said we're attributes of God's thinking well then we've been through it over and over this is 59 sermons of what does God have just a literal type of seed does he have to come down when the baby's born and put that seed in there like Illustrated Wednesday the two Soul people they believe that when you're born as a baby Satan is sitting there waiting to put a soul in you and I asked him a simple question said Satan beat God there and he put that soul and then God comes along behind you know and he puts his soul I said Ain't It Funny looked like somewhere down the line with all of his infinite wisdom he would have been able to beat the devil at least one time let's see that's sarcastic you're not preaching by revelation but is it the truth if that seed was put in you and I before the foundation world and that's what your Prophet said and he asked the question when was it put there he said before the foundational when was your name written in the last book of life he said before the foundation of the world all right what was back before the foundation were you and I you're into the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence well see we don't want that we want something fast preaching where we can haul and scream but do we pay attention to what we hear not throwing off when the man's message like I'd enjoyed it was coming home some of the people began to say didn't he say so and so I said yeah well what do you think I said well I think he said what he meant well see I was glad that they heard it without me having to get in the bus did y'all hear all them wrongs no and it wasn't that much it was just little points you know some thoughts he had and that's his business but have we been trained long enough to be able to let the Holy Spirit and you remember the Holy Spirit doesn't have anything to fight with unless you bring him the word yeah you know you got to bring it to him see that's all I've tried to say about throughout this series of the foreknowledge and how that right around the city doesn't predestinate my desires he predestinates by his foreknowledge and remember the point of what we were bringing out for knowledge is fur you remember two or three sermons on that it's not predestination first those who he foreknew he did predestinate so foreknowledge is first foreknowledge is knowledge before of what will come right so does God have to put something in you or is that foreknowledge that he has enough to be able to hold us that he knew one day you would sit and hear the word I read the Bible or turn on the tape or whatever see and you would hear it but it's just like they were talking to a man one time about this seed being there and I made a simple statement I said well brother Branham said that even Mary heard from her mother Anna you know boy he lit in on me I'm tired of this old mother doctrine that y'all are preaching pastor and I were looking at each other you know he said that's old Catholic Doctrine got it from her mama it's what your Prophet said and we'll get down to it in a little while and the woman at the whale remember she said we know she had heard it from somewhere because I still believe Faith cometh by hearing I don't believe you can get it without hearing well rest God I've got it myself come on if you read it somebody said it and the Bible's still right Faith cometh by hearing but you see why it's so important then the kind of word we hear the kind of seed that is sown have you been with me on that in a series so important so how can a preacher preach and how can we hear the Bible says without a preacher and then he says but how can the preacher preach unless that preacher be sin of God in other words right so if he's not sin of God somebody else sent him might have been mama daddy or the devil now remember the Bible says the devil has angels of light that our Ministers of righteousness the Bible says they're not even law teachers because the devil don't like law teachers he wants it all into Grace but then if we're born with so much in US why do we need the prophet to come I didn't need to profit to come and bring we need the message of the hour of course now a lot of Sinner don't need it the ones that brought some of us into the message and I ain't talking about maybe a year but a lot of times the ones that taught us in our early days what are they now where are they at but you see church we in the day we are in the day of manifestation and you and I are going to manifest what we are and it's like I told them last night some of them and we're getting pretty old and I told them not in the meeting but outside I told some of the brothers I said if we don't hurry up and get out of here and rapture we're going to be having Fellowship meetings in the nursing home and about right and I'm not throwing off on nobody in the nursing home but we're going to be saying hey what do you say he said Trinity's right you know shake you loose all right but you see why it's so important what kind of a seed to this song now brother random words original seeded I ask you to listen to he talks about the denomination so I want to see Billy Graham or Robertson today so deceit what the Bible come on you want the quote from him he said but the word has been sown pure in an unadulterated something to that degree apart from man's Creed by who him and with nobody else right him all right see we had to have the message to be able to turn us back to even the thoughts then he emphasizes we were listening to a tape the other day but around the emphasizes Galatians 1 8 where if an angel come from Heaven you know and bring anything he said see there he said if that angel comes and tells you something until you come from heaven he said let him be accursed of course now we got a lot of angels because everybody's wanting to lead right into raising up with their doctrines but listen now be sensible if that word was sewn into our hearts or whatever when we hear it so then it's very vital to hear the word in it correctly see that's your responsibility it's your responsibility to find out what it's right or not it's my responsibility to preach it okay but then knowing that God can't Quicken a false Doctrine Lord reveal to me a trinity now there's no such thing but then if we believe that we must hear the word and we believe Faith cometh by hearing and then we say well the prophet said the seed was sown before the foundation were amen and all of that was in God's mind in his mind he looked down through time and he saw that Jesus Christ would die upon a cross right so we could go ahead and write it down because as far as he's concerned remember it was already finished that's why people don't understand about brother Branham that was the that was the thing that caught me was a man talking about something present tense we talked to what was and talked what will be and then we found out the prophet said that's the problem with man right looking back looking forward never looking at what's happening see that was a thing when I heard him talking about the Bible he made the Bible become alive to me now present tense I could see it I'm not talking about you remember I told you what 30 years ago maybe I said I'll quit trying to go to heaven I'll try to tell you don't want to go to heaven I didn't say that I said I'd quit trying to go well you know what I found out heaven was coming here run around and say I'm not saying he's coming saying I'm saying he's here well you know what I don't mind saying it he was the only person in the world that believed that at that time why because he's the only person that was revealed to right see when a prophet sees something you remember Isaiah a virgin shall conceive you know what that was real to him that was reality but maybe five minutes later he's walking off and he said what in the world did I say why he lost the reality but God's thought it already been presented it was made in the word so I wrote a random speaks positive he said one time like this he said we don't see you no more please maybe he said if I don't see he said if I don't see you no more he said I'll see you in the future home you ever heard him talk like that well you know what there's a Rapture a tribulation a thousand year millennium a white Throne judgment and then a future home I guess next things it's your home even though his words were there that was not what he said well you're a dummy you don't believe what I say it I think about what he said he said you always was eternal then that means you're God any problem the only one is eternal but now when he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal vast difference one of them is God himself as God transmitted down to you and how was he transmitted down by Calvary God himself had to give his own life before eternal life could come into anybody but you see that's the point that we do we take a little woman at the whale and we say and I've got them laying right here if you want me to read them I'm just going to try to preach it and we say that little woman at the well when she heard Jesus said that word was quick unto her to come alive amen but she had to go to the upper room to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Bible said that the Holy Ghost had not been given right because Jesus had not been crucified how could she get eternal life before Calvary and I made the statement and I know it goes over flat to most people nobody in the Old Testament had eternal life if they did what was they doing in Paradise why was not the up in glory simple but yet that doesn't go through people's brains what do you mean they wouldn't say I never said that but but brother now you didn't I never said they wasn't saved play the take back a lot of difference being saved and have an eternal life you show me how they could be Eternal in the Old Testament you show me how even the disciples could be Eternal without Calvary you show me how you can be Eternal without Calvary I'll put a sign on my back and walk the streets of Louis I'm a false prophet and shut this place down why because I've missed all of it I don't mind saying that but you see before the foundation of the world it was only in God's mind not a reality real to God well brother Dale I'm just now beginning to feel like I was back there what are you feeling it from what you do like Napoleon you remember Napoleon thought he existed in other words you know that's being a silly brother Dale is it you remember the quote run around and said I'm not doing this to how do you straighten out how to bring a dog he said I'm doing this to straighten out a doctor I didn't bring this series to try to make a doctrine of predestination but to show you and I how far we miss it yeah but my Lord Brother Dale you've preached 59 sermons I've done for God what she's talking about I'm glad you thought that of course you listen to everything else you want me to name off the tape I preached on my brother Branham was talking about and we were trying to bring out did God have a seed like a literal God don't need a literal seed church he creates remember is not a word until it's spoken God thought it and spoke it it was a reality to him see we're totally denying any Plan of Redemption to try to make some Doctrine and then we use the quotes that Moses at the burning bush and I believe what happened run around and said five minutes at the Burning Bush was worth more than 40 years of his mama trying to tell him who he was you remember when little and the blind woman in the Bible that was Mary's mother she told her about Isaiah 9 6. you know the Virgin shall conceived but you know that never quickened a thing to her that angel reminded her of the scriptures I mean we got a two-minute conversation but remember that two-minute conversation covered the entire Old Testament to telling her about who that was going to be right she said he said to her said the Holy Spirit shall overshadow thee Isaiah 9 6 is going to come into your womb she said be it unto me according to Thy Word did that give her eternal life may I quote your prophet he said you call her you people I said you call her the mother of God said Remember the mother of God had to be pulled up in the upper room to receive the Holy Ghost but see we just make eternal life just any kind of a thought it's a person like I told you many years ago I said you wait one of these days they're going to be quoting closer what you think what are they doing now well you don't need to be born again you did what the born-again experience is is you just get a knowledge that you always was well then you didn't need Jesus well he died to bring me a knowledge what how dumb can you get he said but I don't like you in your attitude pray for my attitude but remember a dumb donkey tell you the truth you better amen to truth anyway because you can get trouble with God for not taking his word not my word it's his word if you come into the world with eternal life you didn't need Jesus Christ that's simple but no that brother Dale that's just oh yeah okay 12 28. 2013. part 51 morning and evening I asked a question does God have a literal seed or does he create do you remember that does God have a literal seed or does he create a seed if he creates a seed then evidently it wasn't in existence in reality form remember when I kept emphasizing that Jesus said my words he said they are Spirit in their life there's no man in the world ever been able to say that not even brother random he said oh wait a minute you're not talking like it well brother Brandon was wrong about the one horse rider you solve it with God but you see we want to make him infallible when he told you he was not infallible see we think a literal seed came into me but by God's foreknowledge which is in his mind he's seen when you would receive that word or seed but then you had to hear from somebody because Faith cometh by hearing remember we tried to cover that when God thought of something as far as he was concerned it was already ended right amen but there must be a time of what God thought of comes into reality or else he didn't think of it is that fun enough but the truth if he said something it never comes to pies I heard a big man this message one time and said he said me and Bill talked about scriptures that would never be fulfilled uh I'm sorry I got a little memory and that old computer in my mind went to huge and brother Brown said every scripture has got to be fulfilled well I didn't care what he thought brother Branham said I know brother Branham didn't tell him that you called him a liar no he called himself one all right but when he said throughout the scriptures as we read chosen in him and that we came here with a seed in US why don't you cover that this way where the Prophet said when Jesus Christ came we was what in him right is that right you remember the story of the Bible or that it speaks of Eve was an Adam it didn't talk about Adam being an eve but Eve was an Adam we came here was not human us he came here with us in him when we came here we were lost doomed and on our way to hell now you're going to take that loss and doomed and on the way to hell and put eternal life over here beside it when you get to the judgment what are you going to do some part of you got to go to hell sorry what you see if I can believe that he came here with me and him then he went to hell and I went with him right it's all taken care of because he paid the price I don't have to worry about it but you see church if we can believe that we're in his mind not realities the little spots or little peoples or something running around little Souls then we can look down and say thank you Lord look I said we talk about the little woman but around said she was predestinated to eternal life and he said that little seed that would lay in there he said it come alive well that's true but what was that little seed she said we know when the Messiah cometh and what did he say I am he is that what he said did that give her eternal life if she got eternal life by that then Jesus didn't have to die for her and when Moses at the burning bush it was quicker than Moses he'd heard it all of his life 40 years by his mama right 40 years fighting it out with a hot-headed woman out in the desert don't you think he thought about what had been said about his mama mama told me what kind of but when he met that burning bush he wasn't concerned about what mama said daddy said or anybody say it he met the one and he knew before then he run from Egypt right when he could have at least made an Insurrection in the government because he was leader of the government right but something kept me from doing it scared but when he met that burning bush he said honey you ready to go she said where we're going he said we're going to Egypt they're going down there take over she said one two three and there's an argument back and forth whether they had two kids or one you know still the best they could have had with four of them and on the way he gets a guy that runs into a lot of trouble later on named Aaron going down to Egypt take over it you don't ever think sensibly you see why it's so hard to just get on one thing Pharaoh the Pharaoh that loved Joseph was dead you remember one raised up that didn't know Joseph the Pharaoh that loved Moses was dead his son that wanted to kill him he was the king he walked in hey King I'd like to talk to you well first off he's telling me to just go cut his head off because he's the wrong approach he said who is it out there is a guy named Moses I didn't figure he'd make it he almost taught to you okay let him come on you don't think that what was his name said to you or what his name was when it come on you don't think he wasn't afraid of Moses I want to sell you some stock in the Brooklyn Bridge or Alcatraz one he was scared to death of Moses because he was afraid he had come back and he knew Moses could take over the army he was scared of him besides a guy you've run out in the desert and been gone 40 years and you give him enough water or life to him three days you know he's walking back in he was scared but you see Moses wasn't afraid no more does it matter to him he didn't care if I Rose whole Army come out there you know all he had to say and I'm not making jokes of it you never had a speech impediment China they don't emphasize that much in the movies you see but he said Aaron just speak them out of existence that's all he had to say it why because he come down here to take over because he met God you may have heard of God raising a message Church everything but until that had that baptism of the Holy Ghost comes to give you a new birth you're lost we're all lost without the new birth but yet what do we want just quotes Nathaniel I guess that's the way you pronounce him but Iran said he was predestinated into eternal life but yet even meeting Jesus didn't give him eternal life the great Peter that we speak of it was given the revelation the dark the Christ the son of the Living God that didn't give him eternal life he had to go to the upper room but see we don't believe that see we don't believe that you had to receive eternal life to have eternal life because we've been taught we always was eternal we've always wanted Eternal we don't need nobody to die we don't need nothing we just need a knowledge right well in the world's got a pretty good knowledge and the Devil beats you to it and as he says so much sorry but that seed was put dire Christ The Mystery of God revealed before the foundation of the world and we are nothing but when his eyes were open 64. but attributes of God's thinking we're a display of what he thought of you remember Wednesday what we were bringing somebody had to represent us right somebody perfect according to paragraph 131 a broken sister in 1964. someone perfect and to Representatives the scripture calls him an advocate which is Jesus Christ the righteous the Bible says an advocate is one who pleads another's cause an advocate someone who stands between brother random says paragraph 257 up to 250 to 60 of the future home I'd invite you to read let's cover that in a hurry okay go down 14. I'm sorry Wednesday night I I said the brothers had fallen behind back there they were falling way behind on my nose because I didn't give them the quotes I found them on the printer I'm sorry Brothers I wouldn't you know I didn't blame y'all I found out I was the one to blame I left the quote on the printer so it's kind of hard for them to get them because they was running around hunting because they're chilling Brother Anderson telling me telling me later they were trying to fight where's it at I don't know where's that is on the printer but look what he says future home look at the priest wasn't he a son of God it proved it wasn't he couldn't recognize what you say I believe the Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the express word of God or the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that had been back before him that's a pretty good guy right and it's the same today I know that's strong but it's true that was a word that's spoken exactly for the day and yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not recognize it why no matter how scholarly he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination in other words God saw he wouldn't want it right that's simple only the predestinated will be the one who does it only can be and you can only do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be a part of God at all times because he's the only one he's Eternal you see it oh my now if you've got eternal life you're part of God if you come here with eternal life without a new birth that makes you almighty God the god of Glory when the bride of Christ is not the god of Glory she's the god of Glory manifested in another form called a bride right what do we think he had no representation of predestination number 15. paragraph 130. through 132. now look at this priest here we find his bottom part here his back life back behind him his predestination back here is sinful now what's he talking about did God predestinate anybody to go to hell did he predetermine predestinate anybody to be lost the prophet said he didn't the Bible said he would at all be saved his predestination back here is sinful because God knew it right in case I missed it brother Brown said see all that was black we'll probably read it again what made it black because God knew no matter how religious he'd be did he turn down Jesus Christ right come on his predestination back here is sinful here is hell down here so evidently his predestination comes from were now this little part in here that looks like the Blackboard that represents his purity he was a priest he was an honorable man that represents this he was also had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest but you see how he got it was intellectually intellectual learning now this little woman her first life up here she was a prostitute she was all marred up but way down in her here was just a little bit of understanding and watch it I know when the Messiah cometh now where'd she get that somebody told her all right remember the little woman was from over there where the the uh they were in in line of inheritance with the Jews you remember what would it more about his children is that right if I get that wrong you put it in the right in other words that was it was Israel and then this group of people was looking for the Messiah but then the Gentiles wasn't looking for nothing so you know she was looking for the Messiah and when Jesus came and manifested the word because the word discerned the thoughts that was in the heart as Hebrews 4 says it will 4 12 that he would the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and he came as the son of man the prophet what happened this priest with only intellectual learning said it's the devil because that's what his denomination called it what did it do he had no representation so it blacked him out you remember the message Wednesday every Sunday one about representation we were chosen in him he Representatives we were chosen to him he come here with us in him we didn't come here with him and us but this little woman had nothing to present she was so filled in dirties as could be but notice way down in her she's got representation and then she was looking for this to be made flesh and when he said go get your husband this ain't coming up what'd he say you said the truth cause you've had five or not yours others called him Bells above she called in the Messiah right I notice he came to be a redeemer is that right congregation said amen what were what does redeem mean bring back why didn't he get the priest he never was up there okay see he had no representation now what's he trying to explain representation when at the same time that he would write your name in the book would he not know to leave the others out of the book is that simple but would he not know them would he not know of them no no no it's just us we're the elect yes that's good that was the only thing I wanted to say to the brothers yesterday he was preaching only lack to be in one group and whosoever we'll be in another one I agree with you it was perfect brother Brown was a message that's perfect but I want to ask you one question why did Brother random say I'd rather say whosoever will than to say William Brown he said because there's a lot of William branhams but I can take that whosoever will as being me I'm not throwing off on a man's message he's done a wonderful job but he came to redeem but roll it on up and look bring those in the 141. now listen friend if you only think you got is just intellectual learning you get something different from that and you'll never be able to get it unless you got representation that's not why that's the reason I believe you come from the east and west north and south where living May manifest all right what did the little woman have go on to 17. excuse me yeah I guess it's 7 to 18 17. what does she have that's supposed to be paragraph 177 and 179 okay roll it on up right down to the bottom save time we'll get through rain on that what does she have now if it hadn't been in dire to begin with if she hadn't had representation from predestination it never took hold so what is it what if predestination foreknowledge is first those who we foreknew he did predestinate so if you for knew the little woman would be looking for the Messiah when he foreknew the priest now watch the priest was looking from Messiah right come on that was their whole goal was looking for a messiah but when the discernment was used for the little woman she said you're the Messiah right the priests Belgium up you're the devil you're casting out Devils my Bell's above cut him off didn't it and we better be careful what we say about God's word you think I don't live in fear not fear of being lost if I die and go to hell I've been I'm happy I'm honest I'm happy because I've seen what the prophets desired to look into sing God's word unfold to speak of a bride and the truth of what you would be and how she would come into the world and what she would do reach seeds not out with a shelter or uh what is the other one masterpiece and find out how great brother random called us when he said Mary that was the carrier of the seed was not the seed go read it she was a carrier Jesus was deceived he said and that represents Pentecost not meaning there's anything wrong but they could only be carriers but he said this is the time for the seed the seed to be made alive the word to be made Alive In You and I coming from God's mind into reality I stated about the Rapture it's always been wonderful to me when I heard him when he first said it because I knew that the Bible and what it said was prophecies change the moment a twinkle of an eye center Etc was prophecies but around when he got in that message he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass he didn't add to the Bible he told us what it was saying he didn't add to the Bible when he said Abraham and Sarah was made Young which nobody knew that right he didn't add to the Bible he told us what the Bible was saying he said there's going to be a bride in the end time he said God's not complete without you he said the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily that's just making too much out of the Bride why he said it why can't I say it why can't we confess Who We Are stop being so negative about what we well or whatever you want if there's bride we'd be seeing a whole lot more we'd be seeing a whole lot more if you would get that out of your mind because that's the hindrance to keep it from coming to pies you could at least be as a prophet said if I can't produce it what'd he say come on what did the prophet says he said if I can't produce it he said don't let me stand in the way of somebody that can we come in here with our little petty feelings and ideas and our rear ends on our shoulder where you'll understand put them back where they're supposed to be and set out on them we don't think about what brought around anyone would say what if God had that person to say that to you to see what you do and then we when blood's gone don't don't bother love me I know and I'm hard and strong I know that and I know I pray we saw something yesterday and I was three o'clock this morning praying up at six praying for those two people that we saw the problem a 70 year old man and a 20 year old girl you think that don't hurt me if it had been here it would have been a different situation almost got up and took the brother out I knew if I did cause a mass confusion but you let him come here I'll take him out physically if I have to you'd be hateful enough to do that yeah because I'd be trying to save your little daughters any of you get upset at me you were to claw his eyes out but we're supposed to be loving brother Dale yeah and let garbage cans go on too late now is too late what are we gonna do what do you think about predestination you're open for questions and answer this afternoon comments I even write that down give your comments tell us what you believe but you know what most people ain't going to tell you what they believe I asked a person one time had been in the church for about three or four years I said what does your pastor preach on the show that ain't never heard him preach on it well you come here about three months you're going to hear it because I'm going to tell you what I believe in that way it won't be no bars at judgment it's all for my hands but I just don't like your attitude brother Dale have you prayed for my attitude as much as you ridicule my attitude Pride hey remember I gotta look over yours right come on now the pastor's the quote says he's supposed to do it all but there's one thing about it when we come to the Judgment Day then I don't have to back up brother Brown said if you make it soft they think you're trying to pull something over on them come on musician so I make it as tough as I can and tell you to pray for my attitude uh-huh I'll tell you one thing about it if you pray for my attitude God's going to show you that that man loves your soul and he wants us right we get over on the other side we ain't gonna be talking about well brother Dale you said I wouldn't ride you hurt my feelings so what you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free but have I become your enemy as Paul said because I've told you the truth if I hadn't told you the truth your duty bound to come to me but no you go talk to everybody else you talk to everybody else that's Schism in the body you'll answer for that you'll answer for talking to other people instead of coming to me because you might find out I didn't say what you thought that's one of the tapes with her so that I can play the tape to see if that's what I said you know most preachers will not let you play have a tape right comes a change in too often right well won't you come show me where I've changed well brother Dale you've got worse I didn't mean that away right I thought about Doctrine I'd like for you to stand up here and try to preach emu women and if you get up here sometime and try to preach let's stand what do we got 395 Inspire mode remember questions and answers comments write them down brother what do you mean by this you said Georgia what you mean I don't agree with you no problem when you tell everybody else you don't agree with me you'll answer for that one could have always had an open door if the door to my office is locked they want to do things somebody's in there and we're talking or I'm asleep outside of that the doors open I learned that from a supervisor or plant manager adorable you still you could not get up into work
