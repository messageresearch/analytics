you have questions tonight that you wrote down and and everything so we'll try to get to those uh you know as soon as we can and may the Lord bless his word Revelations 1 and Matthew 24 you have

Your Great Name we love you and we thank you comeing now and speak to our hearts as we attempt to answer questions and thoughts on the people's mind yes you be the answer to all things because we can talk all day long and it wouldn't change no one but yet just one word from you would be worth more than anything we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that reth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein why for the time is at hand the time to understand right Matthew 24 verse one and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to sh him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see you not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and he set upon as he set upon the Mount of Olives that was the morning here in the afternoon the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what one stone won't be left on another what shall be the sign of thy coming mhm and of the end of the world you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to to the reading of the word and we were we've been trying to cover some things about the uh what we've been speaking on on the seals and so we had a little time there Sunday that we got into a couple of questions but if anybody has any questions tonight about the the opening of the seals the things that we've been talking about I would that you would ask them now and that way we can try to cover that part and then move on to uh some of the other questions that we have and I've had some lay back car on my desk for about a year now I guess and had them laying there I just ain't got around to answer them yet we have a little time we'll try to answer maybe a little bit tonight but anybody got any comments any thoughts about the seals cuz what we've been covering is that when we look at the seals we know that the literal part of what will happen under those seals like the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God will be on P our time we're not in the time of the literal happening of those things that's right but we are in the time of the working up to that y you know and it takes a long time to get those things into motion and all and that's what we're trying to see what it is now to you know our part right you know and to know what is in in into you and I and that's what I've encouraged you to read the seal book and to uh you know try to find yourself not what the seal is about in a literal extent of white horse rider red horse rider black horse rider Etc uh you know fifth seal Sixth Seal but to read it to see what it's speaking to you right in your hearts and your lives and I I ask you to please cuz when the Lord willing we'll get to it Sunday anyway uh start on the seventh seal so if I would ask you if you would just take the seventh seal message and sit down and listen to it or read it and just read it with an open heart to find out what is it speaking to you or what does it have to do with you you know and what it will be and we'll take some things and cover it as we go along to see how that will work but the main thing is to find ourselves Amen in the revealing of the word because the Seven Seals reveals a complete Plan of Redemption we covered it there's only really six seals to the plan because there's nothing real revealed under the Sabbath but it is so important it must be revealed and then that way we'll get into covering some of the things the prophet has said about it and maybe it will be interesting to do does anybody have any comments any thoughts about the seals cuz some had some they didn't bring and then maybe you can do it that way anybody got any comments any thoughts about what we've been talking on of the seals you know and what I mean by that is in relation to the opening of the seals we the questions I have is in relationship about us with the seals you know and and and connecting to us so it's not saying that this is not connected all the whole word is connected to the seals but it's complete Plan of Redemption any any comments any thoughts that anybody would have to questions about what we've been speaking on if not then we'll just go on in to to pick up the questions and u you know try to continue the thought from the the questions that we were recovering Sunday and relation all of these questions basically are related into the subject of Body Spirit Soul right you know what is this what is that what's the workings of those things and uh you know then it relates back in see will fine like going back into the seals uh because it covers Souls Under The Altar and where they're at and what they're doing and all but now the last thought we were dealing with was the last part of the question and I said we'd stop right here and then we would continue on and the question part was when someone dies it sounds like they're divided into three different places you know the body in one place the spirit in another place the soul in another place and that would would be true and would have to be true because it would be uh you can't put it all together there's things that are in our body that would not be uh what would you call it used or or uh what would be the point word uh they don't connect together MH you know this body has a cast feel smelling here all right now it has no love in it no it doesn't have any uh in this body has no sense of of emotions and things it just displays those things that's right if you just put the body by itself the C test F and smelling here wouldn't even work NOP so you got to have the unit amen you can't you can't get away from having the unit of Body Spirit and soul because God is a unit right but he's not a trinity of beings right but he's a triun being right amen all right so he has Father Son and Holy Ghost the manifestations but he's he's not a trinity so you and I are not a trinity we are a trown being right that's the difference between us and a dog or something right is the the the triun part of us or the part of the soul the animal has a life it has a spirit a body but it doesn't have a soul right and my point I think that what I see about maybe has always been the trouble is we never were explain these things things until the the the prophet's message came into be you know we we never had any concern yet it was there in the Bible and people tried to explain it you know and do things but it wasn't uh anything prevalent right and you know it wasn't a major thing but here we are in the end time when as I was trying to explain the other day that we're in the time where that these bodies are going to be redeemed amen so we have to find out how these things work and what makes it work or what makes us do to learn how to bring the body into subjection unto the spirit that's within it amen right and that's that's well and good to bring it under subjection to the spirit but if there's a different part if there's something different between that spirit and that Soul then that to me would be and you have to admit there is yes even in a sinner a sinner Soul being part of what they are cries out for a maker worships U has uh about it that wants to to do all right because it's that's what what it is that's a difference in it an animal right all right then in doing that see then you would have to come into a position of understanding the difference between the soul and the spirit see then you just say well the soul is just the nature of the spirit but see then you're not making the soul anything other than some form like a bird dog comparing it to a hound dog and you were just making it different that way but I believe that we as Christians ought to come to a place somewhere until that Soul should be controlling us right you say well does it all the time no it doesn't now all the time I I differ with people that say oh I'm just LED of the Lord all the time I just I wish I was yeah I'm not saying or not I'm just saying I can't find that in the word right right I couldn't find it in the prophet's message M because I know he had a lot of problems and I can't find it in Jesus in the Bible because there was times that things bothered him and troubles and different things right right I think it's very vital that we understand the difference between Soul and Spirit and then you got to remember that sometimes you're using quotes that you you have to put the relationship into the form that supposed to be because in the early Ministry brother Ram would call your second real of your being you call it Soul then you call a CER in spirit so then you're studying the vastness of 15600 messages that when you're dealing basically up to 1962 that he would just interrelate those things because if you make a bible study on on the you'll have very little in the Bible to study about the soul you you got a whole lot more relationship of thoughts about the spirit M even till it says Spirits in prison right all right now but see we need to get an understanding of what we are what's taking place and in that then we can we can see ourselves right all right and we we need to keep in consideration as I said now when we try to study the message that you're going to have to study it thinking about even like where it says in Ezekiel 36 I believe it is he said I I give you a new heart right and a new spirit well now God don't take your heart out and do a transplant and that's none of those things are in relationship or even can be used as a type of doings because it's not in that form so then what you have to do is you have to sit down and just listen and like I've always said now you say well brother randam never corrected That Body Spirit soul soul Spirit body you know all he didn't have to because he always gave the outside right five senses right right c t fi smelling here he always gave even though he would call it soul in his early Ministry he always gave it reason memory conscience affections something like that the five senses and then he would always no matter whether one would be calling the inward part of us he would always say that it has only one sense and that's either Faith or doubt right so you're either born again or you're not born again right and then I believe the new birth is not in the spirit because we' come into the day of understanding that's right anointed ones they can be anointed in your spirit all of your life and still be lost right now that that's a horrible thinking whether you think about it or not wouldn't it be something to go all the way through your life as a preacher and give your whole life to serving God and preaching and then stand there and him say depart from you I never knew you right he never argued with him about what they were doing he just said I never knew you said you've never born again right right see I believe that new birth it has to be in that Soul amen it's not in the body it's not in the spirit all right now to me then I'm not trying to be something derogatory to anybody in your belief because we all have to uh if God don't reveal it it ain't revealed I don't care what you talk about what you do right and that arguing somebody is not going to do any good but take some of the things that I'm saying and put it down and just think about it that anointing can be on that Spirit of that individual right of the genuine Holy Spirit and the person lost right right but if that true New Birth is in that soul that person can never be lost righten now that should to me should give more thought or idea to the basis of that the soul and the spirit is not the same thing right or even not so and I know it is so closely related I agree I know that but we all we know the the ourselves but there still has to be a a different between the soul and the spirit if not then you would just have your new birth and your soul in your spirit and and I heard a man say one time that he said I believe we need our brain baptized with the Holy Ghost well I said amen I think that's right I'd like to have my brain baptized with the holy spirit all right now let me say this way what I've always tried to say to you see putting it together and understanding the message then we're going to read the quotes I mean read the questions related and you'll see that to me now the way I see Body Spirit soul I see you just like God is father son Holy Ghost three manifestations with the same God and we are a unit yeah of Body Spirit and soul that's a unit but then to understand where the new birth is at it's not in my body it's not in my spirit right cuz Ezekiel said I give you a new heart right then he go only said I give you new spirit but R said now that's not the Holy Spirit he said that's giving you a new spirit he said go you couldn't even stand yourself the way it was that's right see then the scripture then says I put my spirit in you right now truly the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Spirit see I I've tried to explain that and let me attempt again because I want you to understand I mean that part of you that is the body you know the outward part we blame that fell for all the trouble he ain't to trouble he he he may be in trouble he's under the curse you know all right that's part of it but without something motivating it and with even something to motivate in a certain way you you're no different than any other animal right all animals are motivated by Spirit absolutely right amen and we're motivated by Spirit but see the soul is the part that God is trying brother souls in prison he said he can get that soul to stand still long enough amen he said it'll die yes well see then what I've tried to get you to see about a lot of people say well you know the Holy Spirit and come down and come in me and says anointed ones it didn't come in them all right you got a point but why don't you hold it to a true line point a very fine line to keep it straight and see then you can see that the Holy Spirit can come on your spirit whether you're saved or lost now it has to deal with a religious form right right the Holy Spirit doesn't just come down on everybody's spirit in the world it it's part when you begin to come into a religious order right sanctification right and when it does the Holy Spirit comes down upon your spirit and that Spirit of that individual actually takes a change right it begins to want to go to church it begins to want to serve God why because it's the Holy Spirit the problem is is like the disciples I mean like the Bible said Jesus said some of them took the word and held it right all right they had something for the Holy Spirit to Quicken but what about those others that didn't take the word and hold it they didn't have anything for the Holy Spirit to Quicken so what is that new birth which we say it's the birth of the word and it's true the word we' took and held all right so then what would be the difference in an anointed one and a a born again Christian embody their Christians both of them yep right that's right in spirit you know the love the memories the different the want to go to church to do it they're both Christians y That's why brother random will call them Christians he'll say Christians when when he then he said now you you Christians need to go get born again you know y you say well if I'm a Christian what I need to get born again for is using the word Christian as to just a person making a confession the spirit of God coming upon him and it's the same Holy Spirit but what is that new birth then now listen to me very carefully and you'll see what I've been driving at for 40 years I don't believe now listen very carefully somebody speci me out there you just hearing one message you you're going to get messed up in what I'm fixing to say and make me say something I'm not saying so just remember I warn you other that just say what I'm saying you have any problem call me I I'll be glad to talk to you about see I believe that Holy Spirit coming down upon your spirit it comes down on your spirit just like it comes down on an anointed one sure and it's a genuine Holy Spirit sure and you start going to church you start wanting to be good and you start loving God go said you love God with your spirit AR you begin a a form of what we call a Christian life but then you see those people that a lot of them won't continue on you say well does that anointing leave their spirit m- unnecessary right cuz they can go right out in the world commit adultery come right back in church and Shout Glory Hallelujah you said well well God ain't got nothing to do with that glad you thought of it that way cuz that dealing in that Spirit real right is not the new birth does that Holy Spirit as the Spirit come down into one but don't come down into the other is that what you think you see I've always tried to explain to you one thing that anointing can come down on your spirit and you're still lost but what does that Holy Spirit do why does it say some took the word and held it why would brother around say David said Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee right right around and said all he need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right and yet the Holy Ghost would be on him to kill a bar to kill a lion to kill a giant it would be on him to write Psalms just one after the other hundreds of the ssongs are written by David singing and he would actually sing in the first person they pierce my hands and my feet we ever around and said what he needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost they was already anointed on his spirit and it would even be told of the prophets Etc y don't touch my anointed see you you you get in trouble in a hurry touching the anointing of God that was on a person amen right amen and it was a true through anointing right but yet he didn't have the birth now I hope you can understand why brother R said you can have that baptism of the Holy Spirit every day of your life right and still be wrong that's the simple point of trying to explain it right see then what would be the difference in the Old Testament person and a new testament person Glory Hallelujah we have baptism of the Holy Ghost David could stand there and sing in the first person right and you tell me that the Holy Spirit wasn't on his spirit amen tell you your so messed up because it be down on him and do those great things right and those prophets would receive from God Moses could tell you what happened in Genesis all about the the Genesis one man and the Genesis two man and yep yeah he said well he just wrote down what the Lord told him well that's good the Lord did tell him right but what would be the differ David would be a wonderful Pew dweller in the New Testament I I use that to way I want to pew pew you know a church member right right that's good I mean who in the world who would be a pastor wouldn't want David to be in this congregation right who would want Moses in his congregation no no no now brother Dale now we wouldn't want David we might accept Moses but David was was living in adultery well how many people in this message are living in adultery even the one that would say those things what about spiritual ulry but my point has always been one thing if you could have the baptism of the Holy Spirit and it could do those wonderful things why did you need Jesus to die right right you can't say it was to release the Spirit come on Amen it wasn't to just say I'm going to release the spirit that's why Jesus sent it mhm and the scripture said his his Spirit went back to God who gave it he said into thy hands I commend my spirit what's the difference then in the Old Testament person who could be so anointed that he was speaking to first person and a new testament person what's the difference and why did Jesus have to die it wasn't just to pay the price right that was part of it well he had to die to pay the price for me and you you got a good point but remember the blood of bulls and goats paid the price that's right mhm that's right right right come on Amen we know it didn't eradicate we understand that it's all tied together together he didn't eradicate sin nobody paid the price right that's why brother R said was look back there under the blood of bulls and goats and they done those things and he said we're under the blood of Jesus Christ right he's sure to be ashamed see then what was the purpose of Jesus dying if it wasn't to just and it was in involved to pay the price yes right it was involved yes we know that come on it was involved to have the spirit that was within him that seemingly throughout the Old Testament that it wasn't basically on everybody right because you only have writings of it being on certain ones you know now all would sing and worship and you call that the anointing and the different but you understand what I'm getting at I hope did you just have a David you have a a Saul you know you have a and you say Saul yeah cuz he was listed with the prophets sure and the Holy Spirit was upon him but then you get down into the New Testament and you see you said well that new testament just makes us to where we we we we love God and are willing to give our life you better remember Moses and he said Lord you're going to block their name out right block my name out first words you're going to get to them you got to come over me those people had a great desire but that Soul inside of that individual there was no way the soul of God could come back upon those Old Testament Saints right right that's right that's why Jesus had to die right Jesus had to die to release the very Soul y of almighty God right that's why I believe it brother say in body he was a man said in spirit he was God and said in Soul he was God that's why I've always preached to you that that baby that was born down there when that baby was born God's very Soul came in that body his very Spirit of his being right came in that body amen or else you're a trinitarian right right you're not a Triune your Trinity but you see if if he had to give that Soul see you can't make a ransom just out of the body right come on right he say he gave his soul a r that's GRE but what aboutt where he sa I mean he gave his body a r what about where he gave his soul R right M so that soul is in important thing amen there was no way that the soul of God could come back in an Old Testament person right cuz there was nothing to be able to work upon him in his soul right right and you say well it's just honesty and sweetness and you go to two of them some continent I hate to say Africa cuz people are sitting here and they think I thre off on them I'm not making dummies out of Africans and that's great with the biggest dummies of them all right told you we're just to mixed up Caucasian which is concoction this terminology is using it but you see that person they love their God they'll give their children to an aligator because they love their God and they think their God told him to do it that's right well you can't make it just in love and sweetness and we see Jesus died to release that soul to where on the day of Pentecost brother said his soul came back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's right did it stop on our spirit m right the 120 in the upper room did it just come down to their Spirit well what happened there the key is to understand that the word they held they held that word and said you you've got the words of eternal life where can we go right we've seen everything else fail there's no need of us turning back trying to go back to our churches but that Soul came back on the day of Pentecost and didn't stop on that Spirit of Peter James John whatever you want call them The Upper Room experience it wasn't just an anointing on their spirit it was a quickening of that word they had in their heart right right you agree see now then you're not just dealing with an anointing or something right when you talk when I talk about the alive word that's right I'm talking about Zoe God's own life the alive word when the word is revealed to you no matter what it is there's one God it's revealed to you that's though he Li right right I'd rather put my whole Christian experience and I have to base it on that upon the basis that when that Spirit anointed me it quickened that word amen that I have for two years planted into my heart right I didn't claim this because I came in the message that I had the Holy Ghost I've talked to you and told you about things that happened in my life when I was a kid and I saw God I never counted that to New Birth I can remember when I went to the altar in Repentance I remember then how that things begin to turn and I just never was like the other people that could just go out and live like the devil and come to church and have to go outside smoke I didn't see no difference back then in smoking and drinking I didn't I never made a table that certain people going to go to heaven because they they they smoked but the others drank wasn't going to get to go yeah I never was that way I wouldn't like this lady was standing at my mother LS one day and the guy a neighbor was cutting Grace Sunday afternoon she said he'll pay for that one day he'll die and go to hell cutting that grass on Sunday oh my that's what she belied yeah but you see that new birth is when that word that you've held what little bit it is no matter what right or how much great out that it is for 2 years I studied studied pulled away my family lived as a I done the best I could do working for a living and and and everything but yet all I had on my mind was one thing I wanted that word never lost that I still want that word right amen never became dull to me oh yeah there a lot of days goes by and I didn't hear from him about it me and brother Gary talks about that a lot right we talk about the you know the days when sometimes you say well boy I've been all this week and ain't felt the presence of the Lord you go about three months and preach three services a week and still ain't heard had no contact with God seemingly if you don't want to you want to try that I'll be glad to let you have a few months in the pull pit you know you'll find out it works really good for a little while right brother Gary after a while it just kind of dries up and you wonder what in the world am I doing up here I it don't even seem like a Christan little on preacher you just keep right on preaching right go outside so down and out in your own self and you just want to cry you just feel like you're lost and somebody come up and they say Brother Sam I really enjoyed that message I saw what you're talking about then they could bring it back to you you know you say well they seen it but you see that Soul inside of there is what God is dealing with right no if not we' be Old Testament people just like them we have anointing on our spirit but you see the word that you held the word them disciples held Was Made Alive on the day of Pentecost right and that being the word there is your soul your nature your being your person what other things could be called that's almighty god sister G amen I'd rather have you was in the kitchen buming or doing something one day God said that that's just one God I rather how that and all of the things I told you I can take you today Mark the place in the church where I saw God but I never called that a new birth I did I never said coming into the message me I had a new birth right when I heard brother ROM talking about God I realized this man is talking about a person this man is not talking about anointing on spirits that can do things right this man is talking about a person something that's real right not something that you could shout hallelujah today walk outside and cuss the raise can I didn't believe it that back then but you see the soul of almighty God came back on the day of Pentecost you said the soul of God yeah well what are you going to call it if you call it the spirit you're going to cross up yourself right because I'm standing up here talking to you about that that Spirit was already there yep that's right that's Spirit you think about being a spirit was already there they cast out devil they healed the sick that's right that's right without the new birth that's right y it does mighty wonderful things in that Old Testament right without the new birth amen what's the different in the Old Testament the new then the new doesn't just bring you an anointing upon your spirit Realm it goes down in that soul and wipes out that very nature of Satan come on Amen I believe that's right why do you think it's called a fire over there coming out of those two witnesses mouth why do you think the the the writer would say say like fire shut up in my bosom he know that much about it right the new birth never made me quit drinking I didn't do it it didn't make me quit smoking I didn't do it sure puffed the little bit as a kid like every kid thr it away and said want nothing to do with it I wouldn't even confessing Christian and the Baptist at that time lying cheating and stealing and stuff like that I I didn't have no problems with that before I become a Christian even in the Baptist I'd go out and do things wrong go home and feel dirty feel dirty with a Joy about what I've done people tell me so I got to a drunk life and I don't remember what I done I said you dummy right you didn't enjoy it CU he enjoyed it you still remember it but what is the difference in the old and the new then that soul of almighty God not the body of a of God it's laying on the throne not the spirit because he can anoint everybody body right that's why the Bible said in the last days said I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh but look at your anointed ones right what they're doing right and a lot of them live better Christian lives than me and you so let's don't talk about it all right yeah yeah but they don't have the message of the hour if it's not quickened in our hearts we don't have it because that new birth that you receive starts as an Earnest the Bible called it that's right a baby right right starts with a baby Desiring the sincere milk of the word why is it that you are not following all kind of doctrines that's around this message and you know what I'm saying the truth you can't argue the point right cuz you see people that are so sweet and humble and good people and and everything but they'll follow every kind of garbage Canin doctr you be thought of and they'll get off of this today and get on another tomorrow right have people in the message you just make one prediction right after the other one this is thus sayith the lord well it didn't happen next week you got another one this is thus sayith the Lord and everybody just run with them where's the Christian supposed to be here right but you see the difference I'm trying to explain the difference in Soul and Spirit okay cuz you can have that anointing on that spirit but if that word down in that Soul ever gets quickened you might as well leave them alone brother around said that's right that's what he said he said if you ever get one touch might leave Al that's what I deal with that Soul or that individual that I'm looking at internets or whatever is looking at a soul of an individual oh my because that's the only way you can have the new birth amen right brother D you don't believe that the Holy Spirit comes down and goes in your soul not just as the Holy Spirit that's right amen exactly right I believe it comes down on you and come down on anointed one same way yep that's right the difference between is the anointed one doesn't hold the word honors it respects it and believes it he lets it get twisted up by every Doctrine a wind of doings you know and how can God make that alive right how can you make a doctorine sister Gail that's not even in the Bible you know a two Soul 7 Thunder virt peris and River Jordan they ain't even in the Bible how can make that alive right that two Soul Doctrine started back there in the when right when we first came in the message is when it had begun and to hear them people and they were saying this is what all of my life I know there's something about this this is what I've been waiting on but see instead of bringing life they brought death right because they never gave birth you remember the quote brother around said false prophets bring what false births true prophets bring true births you say to me he said brother Dale you believe I'm a Christian your confession is what you're saying right mhm right what do you think about it sometimes I think you need a new bir but that's not for me to judge that's right cuz I'm not a judge I'm a preacher of the Gospel see then I can see that there's a body anybody can follow that right but then when that's Soul and Spirit you try to get too close together to you you flopping it and see that to way was what brother Brandon was doing in his early Ministry come on he would say Body Soul spirit and then in other times he'd say Body Spirit soul in the early Ministry and all you got to do to find out what he's talking about you just see the senses right outside's always got the five second Realms always got the five the cims only got one Faith or doubt you're either born again or you're not born again but you see then that way we can see what really did happen God had to come down in flesh right right had to mhm not to just anoint the people n it was already there amen amen that's why I've always said it about John what would you have done if you was John the Baptist bless God I just jump right in there you run up thereus and you look at him and there's a holy spirit on the man M that's right come on did wouldn't it cus that said it was necessary that one die for the sins of the people what you done if you John walking up did you see those things happen cu the Run said to her s Saul was he said he go down there he said get under the spirit he said it be on all that he listed with the prophets cus was he a dirty mean guy now they've killed him but he was speaking in the first person really in the for what he was say that it was necessary that one die for their sin now you can turn around and don't worry about it I know all about them thing cuz Satan talks to me too you say well what he meant was it's necessary that that one die for to keep us from all having to die I don't go that way because brother Brown said cus under the anointing said it was necessary CU he was quoting scripture but he couldn't get the new birth the great Nicodemus that would defend the Lord Jesus great gamea that would say you're happily to be fighting against God you better leave it alone but yet they couldn't receive that new birth said there's no record CER I mean Nicodemus or DEA ever received a new birth but he said they'll be given eternal life because of their stand up for the gospel wonderful God Amen see I'm trying to just take a simple little thing in your own life to let you see that have the new birth you can see the difference in Soul and Spirit amen that's right because you know know there was a day you Lov the Lord you went to church you were happy when you first heard the message maybe but then one day you realized you wasn't born again you ever come to that you realize you wasn't born again right amen that's right and there's a lot of difference between the spirit and the Soul now once they're together in an individual we're going to get into the question here in a minute about it once they're together in an individual who's trying to be a Christian but R said all of those memory reason conscience and things are all right if they're lined up with the word the Bible says come let us reason together you said but we're supposed to cast down reasoning we're supposed to cast down Satan's reasoning right not God's reasoning come on you talk to God he comes down he's got a reason with you to a degree cuz he got to get through them right and I don't understand how he can do it you talk about talking about a great God when I look at me and you and I think about how that God some way in the world came down through my brain through my senses of hearing and then went on into the reasoning factors that brother Brandon said them flu was what was plugged up in the garden the flu of memory reason conscience and all in the garden and yet God can come all the way through there and speak to her soul amen that's an amazing thing amen right you said well brother D you definitely believe difference in Soul and Spirit I definitely do yes absolutely amen I do definitely believe amen but then I believe that we get them all back together right and then when we do get it all back together we can realize R around and say that the nature of the spirit is God if you're born again he said the nature of your soul he says soul is the nature of spirit spirit's the nature of Soul yeah cuz if we're born again we should not have the spirit of the world we should have the spirit of God right amen right if you see what I'm talking about that 120 sitting in that upper room all of the anointing had left amen come on you agree with me they got in that upper room all the anointing of the ministry was gone CU Jesus told him don't do that no more go in that room and wait man and they were down and out until brother random expresses that one of them got up and said I think we're dist by faith Peter one other of said nope he said stay here until and we ain't got what he had CU go we're scared do you want to go out John run out there go tell them about Jesus I'm not going cuz see Jesus wouldn't will him to take care of them right when that Holy Ghost came come on Amen the same man that had went up and come back went out the door and the people called a bride Amen in their soul amen right was the very soul of almighty God right the very person of his being not just an anointing come on all right man the very God of Glory walked out of that upper room right and went right down and said you men and Brethren this is right said go out there and took the horns and call them yeah we'll preach to them now yeah but we're not afraid yeah right because they can't touch us until he gets through with us that's right cuz we've seen a man treat years in a half that we've walked with him that they couldn't lay hands on him that's right right you just walk out in the midst of them right that's true they couldn't get to it and said well we might not believe a lot but if that same thing is in here then I'm Not Afraid are you afraid of what you believe now I'm going to make a statement I know hard but you know the biggest portion of preachers of this message won't tell you what to believe true that's right they try to get you to believe it by sual things is that the correct word sual deceiving orinal okay y'all pronounce correct to get to word it brother dick caught on to what I'm believing oh Lord go tell him about it brother dick yeah but you see I believe if you take out that soul out of any man on this Earth You know any man Christian or he's dead that's right yep because he's a unit MH you take that Spirit part out of him you de your body can't operate without the spirit right and the spirit can't be what it is supposed to be without the soul that's right right no he didn't it'd be another dog right right right monkey keep cat horse keep on it'll start talking and teach them to talk keep on keep on keep on get them to count no difference that Soul that's in you is so valuable God didn't die now listen closely he didn't die for this body that's involved yes come on he didn't die for the spirit that's within you right he died for that Soul that's in you then what is it body to body he's my brother right come on is I am I in the scripture that he wouldn't have a problem calling us Brethren y right in the scripture right body to body e my brother right Spirit to Spirit he's an anointing of God yep the love the joy the peace the goodness the soul to soul he's my savior amen n than New Birth that's why you don't see me like everybody else preaching and hollering and doing this that and the other I just keep right on preaching he said well brother Dale and I know I've been told a lot of times said you need to let up a little bit you're too deep I'm not brother Ram would stand there and preach the seals and hundreds would weep their way to the altar right Spirit to Spirit I can get you in the altar I know how to do it Spirit to Spirit I can get in your bill you know what I mean by that sure but if I'm talking to your soul I ain't worried about the other part right Amen brother Dale don't you think he need to preach what these bodies is doing ain't never converted nobody yet come on am I in the Bible or not the Bible said the goodness of God is what leads you to repentance it don't say beat you over the head if you're not condemned in your soul come on you ain't going to never become a Christian that's right word say condemned in your spirit condemned in your body go right on make a good neighbor fill up to church use and pile the money in pay the parking lot cuz you're going to get to have on count of that that's what you think you see where preachers are making Christians in the spirit real right they're not preaching into the souls of the individual that's right amen is it that they don't know what a soul is amen now with that in mind let's take a couple of questions and then we'll quit we're probably going to be on question and answer Sunday again but that's all right all right amen all right we got up to the point that said when someone dies it sounds like they're divid the body goes one place the body go Spirit goes another Soul goes it does the prophet of God emphatically States what the spirit is released from God goes to the soul so or which way will bring it and SWOT Spirit release come to the soul soul to the body stand on Earth amen Soul release come to the Spirit come to the body stand upon Earth and resurrect see we can get all tied up in why the words are swappy but just remember one simple Story one simple thing there's five senses down there that Spirit real with the individual that go somewhere when you die it has the memory love that thanks to the soul yep and that's where even I was missing it years ago preached on it for many many years and I couldn't see that Soul had any sense other than Faith or doubt then I got to dig it into the word I found out the prophet when they was beyond the curtain of time that was Souls under the altar of those individuals and they had memory reason conscience affections his old horse was there his dog see then I begin to dig and I said Lord there's something different here now this man's explaining something I always just believe that that Soul could just be Faith or doubt either born again or not but you see every person their soul is their individuality of themselves and whether you're lost or saved that's the next point we got the soul of the Lost are in a different dimension so they are The Souls of the Lost is not in the dimension the prophet said The Sinner dead is in The Fifth Dimension the Christian is in the sixth that's right different dimensions all right but that soul of that person in hell you remember the Rich Young the Rich Young Ruler he lift up his eyes in hell so we could see he said I'm thirsty his body wasn't down there right Des send the Temple of water he saying that he was still conscious of a God cuz you'll never lose that doesn't matter what whether your hot and tots in Africa whatever it is that knowledge that Consciousness and he said send somebody back send Elijah they didn't speak to my brothers said he wanted to get a a Salvation campaign started TR to help his brothers right and he was in hell that was that Soul see then if we can realize that soul of that individual has all of those senses right this is the way brother R said it and you've heard it because I give it to you many times he said a greater eyesight than what we have amen that's right he said a greater hearing than what we have you didn't leave it just little minute things that soul is greater cuz you explain to me what you see well brother what do you mean want to see what I see my eyeballs man if you're in Gams with years ago they told a story and youve heard of many others they take the guy they drove around the city they take his eyes up and he drove the city you want to argue with those points well I wouldn't die and I couldn't see it well it's good you got a good argument you die and go to hell that type of argument too but you see you can take a man's eyesight away who was it coin coin was his name the man in the Pentecostal thing brother tat them you about it brother M didn't knew about it had no eyeball had one eye didn't have no eyeball in the socket they take up his eye close it up can read you say well I see with my eyeball no you see with your brain right that's what science says and your brain is motivated by your spirit it is not your spirit right your brain is no more than a thumping gizzard or a recorder or a computer but that spirit is what motivates it right but that Soul inside of you is one that serves One belongs after God see that's why that when you even no matter what and it went on the question was to go with that one the soul of the Lost are in a different dimension uh the theophonic form experiencing torment CU that's what they do um thirsting had body senses had memory of a brother to send someone back MH and said don't they have a knowledge of having missed salvation I think by then they have a knowledge they something wrong right maybe they don't fully understand it they missed everything cuz once that person comes back to judgment and stands there you'll stand there and say have not I cast out devils in now name now I like this one so I'll try to explain it it'll take 15 minutes said aren't the souls under the altar in the presence of God there's two in here on the presence of God so it it's dealing with the same point up and down so I just take it as one so under the altar in the presence of God now brother randam when he went beyond the curtain of time he wanted to see Jesus right the angel of the Lord Holy Spirit there with him told him said he's higher you can't see him so what is the presence of God it just like how many Heavens are there the Bible said there heavens of Heavens right heaven to us in the natural is the clouds that's atmosperic or what you call it out here you know then brother R said the first Heaven would be the Millennium so the first heaven we talk about is just natural heavens of mankind so is it with the presence of God I don't believe any person I hope you was catching on to that the other day on the dimensions and in that sixth Dimension they got to be different different overlays or whatever cubicles whatever you want to call them just you make it up that's all right sections positions as the question was that does your your belief make you a position we see I preached that as being a position right and see then in heaven they would have to be seven dimensional parts of the sixth Dimension maybe that's the wrong way of saying it but you need to be sections or whatever because you have to have one for his church age righten then you'd have to have one for the foolish virgins that has died down through those ages because I can't see that you C them their soul doesn't go to torment you know the hell or right the regions of the Lost I'm just honest I can't if I'm wrong I'm wrong I just can't see it that way so there would have to be a presence of God we come to church a lot of times and we come here and and we sing and we worship and we feel the presence of God sometimes we sing and worship and don't feel his pres right that's a way of describing his presence so those in The Fifth Dimension would not be in the presence of God or even in their thoughts brother R said hell is not burning he said really it's a falling right he said because there's no bottom to it right see it ain't got no word to Foundation it right you know it's just falling he said a burning hell would be a pleasure but there's no such thing as that being the presence of God that's absence of God right that's what it was in the garden when Cain went out from the presence of the Lord right had he stayed at the Garden he'd been okay he might have found out what the sacrifice was but you see it's one of those places of those churches down to the ages of seven churches ages and the the foolish virgin would even have to have a positional form that you can say that's the presence of God but then we have the fifth seal Jew and the Old Testament Saints and 144,000 and things and we can say that they're in the presence of God because they were there in the filth Ste and said it was told God told them or somebody told them a presence of God was with those FAL Jews in Revelation 6 told him to rest a little while until your brother so you call out a presence of God but the bride under the altar you know the soul brother Rand went and saw under the altar in a different that was a greater presence than any of the others could possess yes but yet Jesus wasn't there because the plan wouldn't finished and I was trying to preach the other day the Redemption plan would finished he left that for you and I to preach wa we get to the seventh seal he left up for you and I to preach that's right we are to preach the Plan of Redemption for the entire being am amen Body Spirit and soul and that will bring a presence of God here that will take us there right and we meet him in the air so it's not his physical presence see then brother ROM couldn't go up into the presence of God right I know church I know I'm in trouble already takes M that's why why those Old Testament Saints when they went up they went in the presence of God right but I don't believe they went into the presence of God higher right than brother Brandon was representing when he went right and that John went up in Revelations 4 I just can't follow that that they were there the Old Testament Saints was raised in Mortal bodies and made Eternal right I can't go I'm sorry one day you'll learn what I'm talking about CU I have to stand alone I have to preach alone that's always been me have nothing against nobody but I just kind of stay with what I believe now if you show me I'm wrong I'll be glad to accept it but you going to have to bring it for the Lord and let him bring it to me it's got to come from him right thank he take it just because anybody say so what is being under the altar in the presence of God is that where God is if you understand what I'm saying those fifth no uh foolish virgins wouldn't be in hell no they're in the presence of God but they're not in the position of the Bride the fif seal Jew is in the presence of God but not in the presence of God like the bride the Old Testament Saints are in the presence of God but not like the bride when Samuel was brought up now this a question or statement question Samuel was brought up by the witch of Endor he knew why God didn't answer Saul he had What's called the present our presence of mind you know thoughts of mind sure he had that he knew why Saul wouldn't get an answer from God he was a prophet he was still in that position sure doing that right let me run fast through this okay when God created Adam in theophany form Genesis 1:26 he spoke to Adam giving him information that Adam received you remember he named anal he understood what God was saying Adam could said could this be reasoning of the spirit sense no now Genesis 1:26 man is not not a spirit man now come on I know you going to know the quotes you know the quotes okay you got it go around call him a spirit man but you better go on and read a little bit and he called him spiritual be Genesis 1:26 man is not a creation of God of a spirit to come in and anoint you no right Genesis 1:26 man is the theophany Y amen he just put that in 27 and that man on Earth had eternal life because that theophany and God had eternal life so when the 126 was put into to 27 now you got Adam on Earth as an eternal person but his body wasn't Eternal right are the spirits are are the Saints under the altar redeemed back to 126 sounds good but have to say no unless you're talking about the bride now when you're using Saints under the altar as bride you correct that's right but if you're using it as the fifth seal Jew and and even the 144,000 or whatever they will never have the Genesis 126 man right even though they have eternal life right that 126 man is at theing of almighty God Amen that's right right which is the soul of God that soul of God was put in a man called Adam right cuz he was Body Spirit and soul Adam right but then that theoy soul of almighty God come into Adam and gave him eternal life right in his soul Those Old Testament Saints are giv eternal life the FI Shield you is given eternal life the 144,000 even receive eternal life here right but they'll never be the bride right that's right they'll never be the one 26 man they can never say and listen to me they can never say let us make man in our own image than you catch it foolish virgins are given eternal life but they can never say let us make man that's right the 126 man was a Creator God that's why brother brother say it you have within you the ability to create a world and go live on it but it's controlled by the law of God nobody but the bride if I'm wrong I want to know it even though those people are put in flesh all of those people that we Nam the Old Testament Saints 144,000 the pH you the foolish virgin even though they one day will stand in eternal life in Soul and body but they'll never be the bride that's right they'll never be the 126 man he said but you have to give them the soul it's all right I don't have no problems with you but I know what eternal life is the Bible said eternal life is in his son right eternal life is in his son and that's what we are that's right you remember here while back when I tried to explain it sure you can explain it like we're talking about Dimension like we talking about presence you can explain that when we receive eternal life we become the children of God yep but we're not called bride oh we're just babies right one day we can be called a bride then a day can come that we can be called his wife that's right we can ain't the end of the story we can be called his offspring yep his family but the Bible says it come a time when you be known as your known listen Church there is no word that I've ever Ted in any form that because you progress in stages upward that you do away with anything behind you if you're thinking that you got a carnal mind and you really miss what brother Dale what to try tried to say for 40 something years we will always be his babies your little children right John in the writings of John look at him I write unto your children I write unto you young adults I Rite unto you fathers he was speaking to three different groups of people but you can never be his bride unless you're first his child right you can never be his wife until you're his bride you can never be his offspring if you're not all of those other things see he said when you trying to make us something special amen I wish I had the words to explain that amen amen it ain't going to be when we get to Heaven There ain't going to be no God come you're you're you're dumb if you think I'm talking that way when we get there the Bible says we will be like him right right he'll always be my father but at the same time he's my brother now you explain that one you explain that he'll always be my brother but he'll always be my father I can always call him daddy but he can call me wife I've got in trouble trying to explain that that you men think you're something cause you MN door in the body your feminist right that's right you don't want to be finished not this kind but you want to be his wife right man you can't explain that but if you you can see it you can see how he can be father son Holy Ghost healer deliverer Advocate amen comforter he can be all of that right and yet be God right yet be God I think I got most of the questional part there I'll stick others back in death I was going to get on cuz I had them in there on my wrote out on my thing for a long time on outla somebody slid it up under the thing and I've got him in there speaking on marriage and divorce and speaking on tithing and church order and something else I've been let on my desk for I don't really know how long one of these days I get around to answer that but in the meantime if you go back to 1991 where's Brother Ray let's stand Brother Ray copy those Tes he said you in 1991 said you preached on a Wednesday didn't screamed and hollered about marriage and divorce well I had voice back then I guess you notice yeah I not put no cough drop inight see when I'm doing the talking I have trouble I to take a cough drop keep it going but when he's here I don't have no trouble amen cuz he'll give me the voice for what I need amen amen anybody have a need just think about it the Great I Am is living in his Bri the
