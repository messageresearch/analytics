[0:35] I'd like for you to have your kit

[0:41] services so then I'll make the
[0:43] announcement this afternoon but we're
[0:44] going to have a baptism this afternoon
[0:46] so we're going to have to rush out of

[0:55] so okay I think to do
[0:58] it oh fantastic great great so they're
[1:02] coming this morning or yeah they're okay
[1:06] they would just go upstairs okay but
[1:08] yeah all right Revelations chapter 6 now
[1:13] last Sunday we kind went back through
[1:16] one back through two and up to three and
[1:19] never really got to
[1:20] four and we're talking on the Seven
[1:24] Seals uh the first four seals we stayed
[1:27] on oh man it was how many 20s something
[1:31] Sundays so we may do 20 something
[1:34] Sundays on 5 six and 7even but we'll see
[1:38] but let's just get a
[1:40] u basis of what 1 2 3 and 4
[1:44] is and this is very
[1:47] important and I don't want to be I don't
[1:50] want to be
[1:51] discouraging but if 1 2 3 and four has
[1:54] not been revealed to you 5 six and S is
[1:57] going to do you no good mhm okay the
[2:00] first four is your Redemption the
[2:02] Redemption of you having the new birth
[2:05] because that new birth is what's going
[2:07] to take you in the
[2:09] Rapture if you don't have the revelation
[2:12] of 5 6 and
[2:14] 7 then you're still going to be I mean
[2:17] there's
[2:18] people let me put it this way there's
[2:20] going to be millions of people that are
[2:23] bride that never understand the seal
[2:28] Millions but there not prere reccord
[2:30] that that you understand the seals to be
[2:32] born again now the Born Again experience
[2:35] is the life of Jesus Christ Paul said
[2:37] the life I now live I live by the seal
[2:39] no he didn't say that he said I live by
[2:40] the faith of the Son of God right Jesus
[2:43] Christ accept him as your savior going
[2:45] through justification sanctification
[2:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost getting that
[2:49] unclean Spirit out keeping the guy out
[2:52] putting the holy guy in and and then
[2:55] that gives you rapturing Faith now that
[2:59] doesn't say body change Faith but there
[3:02] is a group in there that's going to have
[3:03] a body change Faith but rapturing Faith
[3:06] uh lies in the tapes and the books
[3:08] brother Brown said well there's only
[3:09] going to be a small group that's going
[3:10] to that's going to literally stand here
[3:12] without death the rest are going to have
[3:13] to die and go by the grave but they
[3:16] still have Rapture and Faith cuz what's
[3:17] going to bring them up Rapture and faith
[3:20] faith their
[3:22] faith Romans 8 the spirit of him that
[3:25] raised up Jesus from the dead if that be
[3:27] in you it'll Quicken your mortal body
[3:29] what whether you're alive or whether
[3:31] you're dead in the grave he going to
[3:33] Quicken that mortal body one way or the
[3:35] other by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[3:38] all right dwelleth means an ongoing not
[3:41] just an anointing but an ongoing process
[3:44] all
[3:45] right
[3:46] so the revelation of the seals was was
[3:49] to help us understand the Redemption of
[3:51] the
[3:52] body um because in the for seal the
[3:56] Rapture takes
[3:57] place TimeWise
[4:00] TimeWise does everybody understand that
[4:02] TimeWise the Rapture takes place on the
[4:04] four Cale but you got to have five six
[4:07] and
[4:08] seven you got to have 56 and 7 somebody
[4:11] does has got to have the revelation of
[4:13] 56 and 7 to make this
[4:17] happen cuz there got to be somebody
[4:19] standing at a body change somebody's got
[4:21] to stand and say Dead come out of the
[4:23] ground all right so that's the that's
[4:26] the group of people I want to be in but
[4:28] it's like brother dick said uh Paul was
[4:31] prophesying they without us cannot be
[4:33] made perfect well when Paul died he
[4:36] became part of the
[4:38] they right Paul said they without us who
[4:41] the Old Testament but then when Paul
[4:43] died we stand in the in time and say
[4:46] they Paul irenius Martin Columba William
[4:51] brandom cannot be made perfect without
[4:54] us somebody speaking the word all right
[4:58] so but so the first four four seals the
[5:01] first four seals shows rapturing Faith
[5:04] cuz you got justification sanctification
[5:06] baptism of Holy Ghost and I put
[5:07] rapturing Faith are brother Brown said
[5:09] the word because four de Messengers
[5:13] remember the Palmer worm Locust
[5:14] caterpillar and whatever the other one
[5:17] is four four eat it down Four's got to
[5:21] bring it back all right four is not a
[5:23] bad number if it's in restoration um or
[5:26] is an Earthly number which we got to
[5:28] have Earthly Redemption we got Earthly
[5:30] restoration all right so justification
[5:33] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:34] that's your walk with God and then seal
[5:37] number four wraps up 5 six and
[5:43] 7even somebody's got to have a
[5:45] revelation of of of seal 5 6 and 7 to
[5:48] bring it back to this rapturing faith in
[5:51] Seal number four but in TimeWise seal
[5:54] number four is when the Rapture takes
[5:55] place because what is five five is the
[5:58] Dead Jews under the altar saying how
[6:01] long to avenge our blood that happens
[6:04] after we're
[6:05] gone right six seal happens when after
[6:08] we're gone two prophets go to Israel and
[6:10] open the six seal and then Jesus Christ
[6:13] coming to us and coming to Israel is the
[6:16] seventh seal which is Jesus Christ
[6:20] revealed in flesh for us to take a
[6:23] Rapture and revealed in flesh for the
[6:26] Jews to take a Rapture because in
[6:28] Ezekiel it says where did get those SCS
[6:31] they reveal Jesus Christ so much to the
[6:33] Jews not a literal
[6:35] man but a spiritual man though into
[6:39] prophets revealed Jesus so much just
[6:42] like we and brown did with us and what
[6:43] we're trying to do with each other is to
[6:45] show Jesus Christ in us right till
[6:48] they're going to say where'd you get
[6:49] those scars in other words where where
[6:52] and why were you
[6:54] crucified and he'll tell them where you
[6:57] missed it back there and why
[7:00] cuz yall said let his blood be on us and
[7:02] our children going back to Daniel 70
[7:04] weeks to make an end of sin a
[7:06] Reconciliation of iniquity uh bringing
[7:09] Everlasting righteousness anointing most
[7:11] I mean U seal up div vision and prophecy
[7:13] anoint the most holy that's restoring
[7:15] Israel back in the natural that'll
[7:17] happen after we're gone that'll happen
[7:19] in that last week that's left over after
[7:21] the Rapture all right so at all times
[7:24] together and that's why brother R said
[7:26] Daniel 7 weeks is important I want yall
[7:27] to be praying we've got two months
[7:30] dad and I are going to be the featured
[7:31] speaker at the next Minister meeting and
[7:33] it's going to be on Daniel 70 weeks so
[7:36] just keep us in your prayer and that
[7:38] we'll say the right thing and that
[7:39] people will understand because same way
[7:41] with the seals the seals were in the
[7:43] Bible in the
[7:45] 1500s but there was nobody could break
[7:47] that
[7:48] seal right like we were talking you know
[7:51] preaching last Sunday about Revelations
[7:54] 5 see there's a lot of sayings a lot of
[7:58] loose ends a lot of things tied up but
[8:01] when that father brought that cloth out
[8:02] there and said hey my wife my daughter
[8:04] was a virgin and here's the proof that's
[8:07] exactly what he was doing with the Bible
[8:09] hey you're virgin here's the proof amen
[8:12] the blood of Jesus Christ has made us
[8:15] free from everything Body Spirit and
[8:17] soul but it's got to be open and
[8:19] revealed right can't be just shut up hid
[8:22] in the closet somewhere
[8:24] right can't be shut up here in the
[8:26] closet it's got to be open so you can
[8:28] see it right right it does you no good
[8:30] if I see it right but through the
[8:33] through the um through the gospel
[8:37] through
[8:38] preachers teachers evangelist pastors is
[8:42] where you get your Perfection we all do
[8:44] because faith comes by hearing not
[8:46] preaching so it does come by hearing and
[8:48] hearing the word of God but to have this
[8:51] rapturing faith we got to
[8:54] understand that what brother Brandon
[8:56] brought to us was rapturing Faith No no
[8:59] ever else had this Faith nobody was
[9:01] required to have this faith that lamb
[9:04] had seven horns and seven eyes he didn't
[9:06] have six and A2 horns and six and a half
[9:08] eyes he had seven horns and seven eyes
[9:10] which is seven complete Church Ages was
[9:12] able then to take the book like we were
[9:15] saying last Sunday I hope you caught
[9:17] that the book is worthy that's right the
[9:20] book's worthy or or Christ would he just
[9:23] he just he didn't lose it but remember
[9:26] God took it back because Adam couldn't
[9:27] produce it
[9:29] it made Adam not worthy the book didn't
[9:31] become unworthy Adam become unworthy so
[9:34] that made you and I unworthy so we're
[9:37] down here unworthy that's why John was
[9:39] saying hey I've got the baptism of the
[9:41] Holy Ghost I got this right here he had
[9:43] rapturing Faith
[9:46] M he'll come up with it he'll come up
[9:49] with that Rapture in faith right so he
[9:51] had Rapture and faith for his time all
[9:53] right for his time he had Rapture in
[9:55] faith he's not going to call for the
[9:57] Rapture cuz he's dead the ones that are
[9:59] dead can't call for a Rapture it's got
[10:00] to be live people all right so he had
[10:03] rapturing faith for his time but he was
[10:05] looking at the no man is worthy neither
[10:09] under the Earth above the Earth or in
[10:11] the earth no man was worthy to take that
[10:12] book no man so so there was a still
[10:16] there was a
[10:18] space a Gap a Chasm a breach mhm then
[10:22] when the lamb came up and grabbed the
[10:25] book John knew then that now somebody
[10:28] that was
[10:29] worthy could take a hold of the ones
[10:31] that were worthy and we could bring them
[10:34] together so it was God and human flesh
[10:36] bringing the U bringing the seal that's
[10:38] why brother R to say here stands a lamb
[10:39] with a book in his hand he wasn't Jesus
[10:42] Christ but he was the nearest thing to
[10:44] it preaching to us right he wasn't God
[10:47] he wasn't Jesus Christ but he was the
[10:49] closest thing to it because he was not
[10:51] physically standing in the Gap like Dad
[10:53] he was talking about that's Jesus Christ
[10:54] but what was he doing he was
[10:58] saying you're worthy right who's worthy
[11:02] to open the book and loose the seal well
[11:05] it was the lamb that was one that was
[11:06] worthy but you know what if that lamb
[11:08] resides in
[11:09] you makes you worthy that's right so
[11:13] that's where we're going to get rapture
[11:14] in faith when we start realizing like
[11:15] brother for preached Wednesday night
[11:17] that was really good to bring that on
[11:18] Wednesday coming in from what from what
[11:20] Dad and I had had ministered on Sunday
[11:23] is bringing that there's there there no
[11:27] condemnation ifes said who can condemn
[11:29] me a
[11:33] sin why can't we but you better not be
[11:37] with sin that's true or you can be
[11:39] condemned that's right so let's let's
[11:42] don't get so high and walk so high and
[11:44] mighty let God do it for us that's right
[11:46] if God will do it for you it's like the
[11:49] Bible says you walk in and sit on the
[11:50] back row God will put you on the front
[11:52] row if God put you on the front row man
[11:53] don't have nothing to do with it that's
[11:54] right but if you go up there and sit on
[11:55] the front row mhm and you think you're
[11:58] something then and God's going to put
[11:59] you on the back that's what the Bible
[12:00] says so you're going to be put on the
[12:01] back row if you go up remember brother
[12:03] Rand that preacher he said if that
[12:05] preacher would have went up like he came
[12:08] down he would have came down like he
[12:10] went
[12:13] up cuz what he went up there with a big
[12:15] head and exalted itself and he couldn't
[12:18] get his thoughts together nothing
[12:19] nothing went right and he came down
[12:21] dejected remember brother said if he
[12:23] went up dejected and had the right
[12:26] attitude went up dejected God would have
[12:28] anointed him he to come down with power
[12:30] of not him but of God all right so
[12:33] that's what we're looking at in the seal
[12:34] we're not trying to find a powerful
[12:35] person the powerful person is already
[12:38] there the Lamb's always been there he's
[12:41] just being made known now that we are
[12:44] worthy that he did you know covers in
[12:47] his blood no part missed same thing with
[12:51] with rapturing
[12:53] faith rapturing faith lies in the books
[12:56] and Tes so seal number four let's read
[12:57] that here
[12:59] and when he had opened the fourth seal I
[13:02] heard the voice of the fourth Beast say
[13:03] come and see and I looked and behold a
[13:05] Pale Horse and his name that set on him
[13:08] was death and Hell Followed With Him and
[13:10] power was given here we go with a given
[13:12] power now unto them over the fourth part
[13:14] of the earth to kill with a sword and
[13:16] with hunger and with death and with the
[13:18] Beast of the
[13:19] Earth all right now you see now let's go
[13:23] through in the fourth
[13:26] seal we see it's a Pale Horse Now what
[13:28] is pale if you mix black red and white
[13:31] and mix it up in a in a dish or in a
[13:34] bowl you're going to get the most pale
[13:38] gray try it sometimes it's just an awful
[13:41] color but that's what brother Brown said
[13:42] it was all three of these horses wrapped
[13:44] up into one same way with the force seal
[13:47] in the spiritual sense is justification
[13:49] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:51] if you have that if you have that that's
[13:54] what wraps you up in the
[13:56] word it's not pale
[13:59] but it's spiritual it's all these three
[14:01] wrapped up together if you have these
[14:03] three then you will have the word
[14:05] there's no way to get around
[14:07] it if you have the Holy Ghost it'll
[14:09] compare with the word you might
[14:10] understand every every sentence or word
[14:13] or whatever true but you just keep
[14:15] holding it there long enough God will
[14:16] make it known he'll reveal it to you all
[14:18] right but you got to have these
[14:21] first That's the basis of all
[14:24] things then you have then the word of
[14:26] God comes to the spirit felli which is
[14:28] the ones that have the Holy Ghost which
[14:30] is what all three of these brother R
[14:33] said these three complete the
[14:35] birth one 2 three that completes the
[14:38] birth then you start your walk and this
[14:40] is your walking God but look at you and
[14:42] I we're compared now with the
[14:46] eagle which is the last of the combat
[14:48] Beast no more combat Beast after that
[14:51] why we don't need any more combat Beast
[14:52] we already got all four of them there is
[14:55] no more there's only four four life
[14:57] Messengers for death Messengers eat it
[15:00] down which is what these right here
[15:03] these horses still ride today white red
[15:06] black and pale they still ride they're
[15:08] still here there's still demon powers
[15:10] there's still things that make us do
[15:11] wrong there's still things that make us
[15:14] uh think wrong and and because we're in
[15:16] this world
[15:18] right but then we have the line ox man
[15:21] and Eagle see in the in this age they
[15:24] only
[15:25] had just enough light to get them
[15:27] through the age
[15:29] they sacrificed their s they weren't
[15:31] bold sure they were bold in the sense
[15:33] that they stood up for God but this was
[15:36] the pure word going forth well the pure
[15:37] word went in the ground right here in
[15:39] the fourth Church age cuz I'm reading
[15:41] some more history on the Roman Catholic
[15:43] church and and man you'd be surprised at
[15:45] what some of those popes did during this
[15:48] fourth age about you know 11 uh probably
[15:52] right at 1,000 ad to about 1500 ad they
[15:56] ruled the
[15:57] world I mean they just ruled the world
[16:00] there nobody stood against them except a
[16:02] little group of people all right but
[16:04] when you come out of that age you see a
[16:06] man named Martin Luther he come out of
[16:08] the very thing that was killing the
[16:09] people he come out of the Catholic
[16:12] church but he didn't get all the
[16:13] Catholic church out of him he still had
[16:15] father son Holy Ghost baptism you see
[16:17] why as you progress it gets more and
[16:19] more into the
[16:21] Perfection they couldn't be made perfect
[16:24] here they're made perfect by the word
[16:26] for their hour amen they're sealed in
[16:29] for the word of their hour all right but
[16:32] they were not and they're the ones that
[16:33] were in that book that was
[16:35] worthy but it had to be a man reach and
[16:39] get that book all right had to be
[16:41] somebody with flesh so somebody's got to
[16:43] be alive right
[16:45] right cuz once that book's finished
[16:48] redemption's over there's no more
[16:50] getting saved all right you'll be given
[16:52] eternal life like I was preaching last
[16:54] Sunday about works the Bible says you'll
[16:56] be judged by your works if you're not
[16:57] born again
[16:59] cuz if you're born again you're covered
[17:00] by the blood and you're judged by his
[17:01] works and if he's righteous and perfect
[17:04] and clean and holy then you're righteous
[17:05] and perfect and clean and holy but if
[17:07] you're out from under that blood guess
[17:09] what works dos and don'ts
[17:14] right and there's going to be a group
[17:16] that will be put in by dos and don'ts
[17:18] there'll be people giving eternal life
[17:19] brother R I read you the quote Millions
[17:21] more then what will be struggling to
[17:24] receive it are going to be the ones that
[17:26] are going to be given eternal life for
[17:28] their standing the gospel and that's
[17:30] every age not just our age but it's in
[17:32] every age but you had the man age fifth
[17:36] and sixth age which is Lutheran Wesley
[17:39] pron presses and all look at look at
[17:41] what look at what's happened Even in our
[17:43] age in just 100 years say 112 years from
[17:47] 1900 to
[17:49] 2012 look what we've went from right
[17:52] hardly no electricity no telephone to
[17:55] now we've got Self Service anywhere in
[17:57] the world
[17:59] we instant messaging
[18:01] instant turn that thing on instantly
[18:05] around the world if we're hooked up to a
[18:06] cable that we can get news we got news
[18:08] around the world all right so that's
[18:10] what we've come in just 100 years well
[18:12] we come out of the man age into the
[18:14] eagle age and it's like man has just
[18:17] took the lid off everything and they're
[18:18] just shooting forward I mean they're
[18:20] just the advancement of
[18:22] man but we know that's the advancement
[18:24] of man but why but why is the
[18:26] advancement of man going so far
[18:29] cu the advancement of God went
[18:31] first they had an eagle Prophet which
[18:34] come in the end time to break that seal
[18:36] open so that we can SAR up in the skies
[18:39] man was afraid to go up that
[18:41] High um I'd be scared to grab a hold of
[18:45] an eagle's foot and take off but if I
[18:49] become the eagle that's right say if I
[18:52] just grabbed a hold of the Eagle's foot
[18:54] and said hey I'm an eagle I'm an eagle
[18:55] and he takes off about 20,000 ft up
[18:59] no but when you become the eagle 20,000
[19:02] ft don't mean that or 2,000 ft don't
[19:03] mean anything right so that's what we
[19:06] got to do as far as and I hate to say
[19:08] the word develop but it's what we
[19:10] develop into you it's like a child right
[19:13] they got everything they need they just
[19:16] got to develop develop into it that's
[19:18] right all right same way with mercy and
[19:21] and Harmony over there got everything
[19:23] they need to be mother grandma and life
[19:26] goes on all that care eristics in those
[19:29] children but they got to what develop to
[19:31] that to where they can understand what's
[19:34] going on that's why the laws protect
[19:36] children from 16 or 17 years down cuz
[19:39] they've not developed yet all right but
[19:41] you see now girls 12 and 13 years old
[19:45] developing a lot more than when even
[19:47] when we were growing up but you see
[19:48] Satan has went right along with God he's
[19:51] not just you say well that eagle
[19:53] anointing puts us way up here well guess
[19:55] what guess who's following us the
[19:57] devil's falling right behind that's
[19:59] right if he's left if he's if he has
[20:02] left you alone I need to talk to you
[20:04] that's
[20:05] right I mean if you're up here getting
[20:07] good Revelation and Satan's nowhere
[20:10] around I I need to stop talk to you
[20:13] because maybe I got a problem but no no
[20:18] he's right up there almost with us right
[20:21] so don't ever think you've left him down
[20:24] here you've not left him anywhere that's
[20:27] right he right there that's right all
[20:29] right cuz see he'll quote you the word
[20:32] but this is what he doesn't have this is
[20:34] my key today he does not have Rapture in
[20:36] faith cuz if he did he'd be your brother
[20:39] he'd be born again and you could you
[20:41] could identify with him and be his
[20:43] brother but he does not have Rapture in
[20:44] faith he does not understand the
[20:47] Revelation behind the word of God he
[20:49] understands the word of God the Bible
[20:51] says he believes in one God and trembles
[20:54] all right but he gets on this Pale Horse
[20:56] which is all these powers mixed
[20:59] together and he heads up in a beast
[21:04] power at the end
[21:05] time which is going to come out of the
[21:08] Roman Catholic church but see we're not
[21:10] going to see that man of sin sitting in
[21:12] the temple if you see him you already
[21:13] missed the Rapture so don't worry about
[21:15] say we're going to who's is the pope or
[21:17] is it Obama or is it this one don't
[21:19] worry about that if you see him
[21:21] physically you're you've already missed
[21:23] the Rapture so so forget about that all
[21:26] right you worry about the man s sitting
[21:28] in the temple of
[21:31] God right here showing himself to be as
[21:35] God so that's where you got to watch cuz
[21:37] you know what brother Brown said the two
[21:38] spirits will be so close it'll almost
[21:41] deceive the very elect if it were
[21:43] possible that's what I mean don't think
[21:44] boy we're at this Eagle Ag and we're
[21:46] going to fly out of here we are going to
[21:48] fly out of here but the devil's going to
[21:49] be right on our heels doing this y so
[21:53] this thing right here is going to be
[21:54] sticky the prophet said until the day
[21:55] we're changed so don't think you've ever
[21:57] got this this thing conquered because
[21:59] you know what you won't but God will
[22:01] tell you when this thing's conquered
[22:04] he'll have to cuz he'll have to come and
[22:07] reveal himself that hey this is my flesh
[22:09] Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone
[22:12] see we quote these things but we're
[22:13] heading toward them right all right if
[22:16] you're heading toward them that's fine
[22:17] but you got to remember like brother
[22:19] Dale said those who prophesy must die so
[22:21] if we prophesy that there's a coming of
[22:23] people that's going to get a body chain
[22:24] then we're all going to
[22:26] die but when you say the one is going to
[22:29] happen to then you've made that prophecy
[22:31] come you've took the breach and brought
[22:33] the breach together right cuz that's
[22:36] what happened in Revelations 5 when when
[22:39] lamb took the book he didn't walk off
[22:41] somewhere else no he just became the one
[22:43] on the throne it was just like a pull
[22:45] that pulled him right up there and set
[22:46] him right down on the throne which was
[22:48] then the son of man ruling and reigning
[22:50] in me and you cuz it's got to be a son
[22:52] of man can't be the Son of God Son of
[22:54] God's been all down through here they've
[22:56] had rapturing faith for all these Church
[22:57] Church ages millions of people but
[23:00] they've never had the son of man
[23:02] Revelation where it and that was God in
[23:04] human flesh not a lesser
[23:06] person not a lesser person same person
[23:10] of God in another form well what are
[23:14] we we're either the same God in another
[23:16] form or the Antichrist in another
[23:18] another
[23:20] form but you see what we're heading
[23:22] toward we're heading we we're putting
[23:24] these together and in this last age like
[23:27] I said it had to be seven horns seven
[23:29] eyes so those seven
[23:32] horns was all that Lamb's characteristic
[23:36] so it had to be all seven Church ages
[23:39] all four
[23:41] beasts all four of these riters in a
[23:43] spiritual form so that we can get the
[23:46] Revelation all right all wrapped up into
[23:49] me and you we need this bonus of the
[23:51] line cuz they had the truth of of M of U
[23:55] one God and water baptism and what
[23:57] happened in the in the garden it was
[23:59] lost here coming back here a little bit
[24:02] but it had to be restored here the two
[24:05] book end first few ages to the last age
[24:08] so all this you're going to have to push
[24:10] here push it here push it here and it
[24:12] all comes into that fourth age I mean
[24:16] fourth seal which was the Rapture so any
[24:21] question we got about 5 minutes any
[24:26] questions kind of kind of confusing a
[24:29] little bit but just
[24:32] remember this is the Holy Ghost for all
[24:36] ages the first four seal cuz they're not
[24:39] going to
[24:42] get the change Faith they all have
[24:46] rapturing faith all right everybody
[24:48] understand they have rapturing faith for
[24:50] their time they'll come up with their
[24:52] group the last to be first so brother
[24:54] brand will come up first with his
[24:58] Church age then Wesley will come up with
[25:01] his then Luther will come up with his
[25:03] and then Columba and then then
[25:06] um Paul Martin irenius and Paul will be
[25:10] the last one
[25:11] up but they're all going to come up by
[25:14] rapturing faith that they
[25:17] had see to make a long story short they
[25:20] had all this in the Holy G that was in
[25:23] them that came to them even in the oxas
[25:26] all this brother R said whatever you
[25:29] need for your journey when you get the
[25:31] Holy Ghost that's what you get right
[25:34] well their Journey was through everybody
[25:36] that got the Holy Ghost the prophet said
[25:38] went through justification baptism the
[25:40] Holy Ghost but they didn't know to name
[25:42] that only in the eagle age were we able
[25:45] and even in this four seal they were
[25:46] able his name that set on him was death
[25:49] now he was death from the first from
[25:51] right here he was death right remember
[25:53] Untold billions he killed with his
[25:54] Doctrine right here so he was was
[25:57] already in here death and hell was
[26:00] already started right here because those
[26:02] that turned God down died spiritually
[26:05] went to hell spiritually and they're
[26:08] going to come up and be have to give an
[26:10] account and go right back to hell okay
[26:13] everybody understand that but only in
[26:15] this age and I look and behold a Pale
[26:17] Horse and his
[26:18] name his name that set on him was death
[26:21] and Hell Followed with
[26:23] him so all this was already in these
[26:26] people they just couldn't see but just a
[26:28] part of them part of the of a spot for
[26:30] their age Martin Luther just youall live
[26:33] by faith but when Martin Luther which
[26:35] type
[26:37] justification but he had to go through a
[26:39] form of sanctification to get to the
[26:42] Holy Ghost because brother R said
[26:43] everybody goes through justification San
[26:45] you might go through it in 15 minutes or
[26:47] 15
[26:48] years doesn't
[26:50] matter Luther had to come the same way
[26:53] Wesley but they couldn't name
[26:55] it see they couldn't name it because the
[26:58] name had not been the name had died here
[27:01] see they could see even Paul said
[27:02] Grievious
[27:04] wolf John was the only one that said
[27:06] Antichrist because he's the one that
[27:08] went to Revelations and saw the
[27:09] Antichrist knew the name of it wrote it
[27:11] down and come back and said the
[27:13] Antichrist is working already in the
[27:16] group of people but Paul said Grievous
[27:18] wolves what is Grievous wolves the same
[27:20] people that's in this end time
[27:22] persecuting the bride Same Spirit but we
[27:26] know it is the Antichrist or the Beast
[27:27] system or the false system because there
[27:30] wasn't a Roman there was Roman
[27:32] government here but there wasn't a Roman
[27:33] religion there was no Roman Catholic
[27:35] church till about the third age second
[27:38] and third age somewhere in there it
[27:40] started in um Nan Council 325 ad is when
[27:44] they started putting everything together
[27:45] all right Constantine came up and he
[27:47] took Rome power of physical Rome and
[27:51] took spiritual power and put them
[27:54] together so they started worshiping all
[27:57] these different
[27:58] gods and took the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:01] Christ out and put Father Son and Holy
[28:02] Ghost well that held all the way through
[28:04] to right in here then the name became
[28:06] restored just like this right here it
[28:08] was always called Death it was always
[28:10] called hell Antichrist Beast falsy same
[28:12] person it's a devil we just see that he
[28:16] started as a deed a Doctrine a say a a
[28:19] saying a deed a Doctrine but he comes
[28:21] right on over here and right here he's
[28:23] going to be absolutely put in the power
[28:25] that he wants to be put in right right
[28:28] which is the false system or you can say
[28:31] Roman Catholic church but you don't have
[28:32] to say Roman Catholic Church cuz it's
[28:34] all denominations now cuz they had
[28:37] daughters in with that Harlot the
[28:39] daughters was the same as the Harlot all
[28:41] right so there's the first four
[28:44] seals U next Sunday we'll start on the
[28:47] uh on the fifth seal so read the fifth
[28:49] seal all right let's go Lord bless
[28:56] you
