so Donnie did you turn that off thank you oh brother the time to let's bow our heads will dismiss brother brother we're just getting started okay good to be in the house of Lord man glad the lights work by way of announce a little more about what we've got going sister Rachel April 27th okay April the 27th we will have our Spring Fling at the city park like we always do so it will be April the 27th we're gonna try to schedule these things together i sat down the other night for about an hour and scheduling my whole calendar till the end of the month I'm in the end of the year so maybe you need to do that sometimes and stuff won't jump out on you or jump up on you so April the 27th we'll have our Spring Fling festival down at the city parking gills bill so keep that in your mind that gives you a long time to remember it all right also March the 7th through the 19th I'm going to the Philippines so we're getting emails back and forth and we're gonna try to do do a few specific things while we're there and then Bieber brother Danny and his meeting and beaver brother Roy Ellen his meeting just like we did before a few years ago so just keeps us any prayers and as we get ready to go so also remember to if you wish instead of doing it marks the second I thought well maybe we do it before Bible study and that they some that's not gonna be able to attend so why don't we change it and do it Sunday afternoon while everybody's here okay yeah okay so Sunday afternoon make sure if you're an officer of the church to be here and if you attend the church you can come to because you will be here for a second sister Gayle you laugh but you really have self so be March the third so to be the third of March all right let's get started revelation 6 verse 12 really remember brother Cody's family at brother Dutchess that was that was rough the little brother just went in with blood clots in his leg and and he passed away because one of them moved and went into his heart or his brain one and took him for those of y'all that did not know it I think we already announced it but it's been a month or so ago the city of Lula never wanted to sell that property because of the well-being there used to be that used to be the city well little years ago and they cut it off and they're using well somewhere else we anyway they didn't want to ever sell this well they come up the other day and just wanted to get rid of some property so they gave us half of this property the grass park because we never owned that we just don't really right up to where that where our awning is so we got now to where the basketball court is and brother Buster and them they gave them the other half of that light so we own the tool there's no blood in between us anymore we own that part the church does and this little white building right here and bustering them owns from there up to about where that basketball goal is so and the city of Lille gave it to us I hope the city of Lula gets a blessing from that man let's give them a hint we just had to pay for the church paid for the closing cost which was several hundred dollars but still we got property 400 dollars he pitched in for and we pitched in for and the land now is ours so we can pave it so we could don't have mud everywhere we can pave that part and and be able to accommodate a few more cars so thank God for that they just come up one day and I read in the paper and they said they were just gonna give us the land so that's great yeah that we being a City Councilmember I know what today you you can abandon property in other words they didn't want to maintain it so latest ones they just said well since you're attached to it we'll give it half to you in half to them so so that's what's going on there so just think if you ever seen anybody do Loula just thinking because they gave it to us they didn't have to they were gracious enough all these 50 years to let us use it as parking but now we own it so we can pave it and we can you know do some things so so just keep that in you in your heart in your prayer revelation 6 verse 12 this print the only father thank you for this day that we have here to serve you set aside just a little bit of time Lord to talk about you there's a lot of things that we we have the Lord that that we want to say but Lord if you don't say them then that's just me saying them and I pray that you do the speaking today Lord you'd be the one that does the revealing father because without you here Lord we're nothing Lord just coming to anoint us all today this whole building father just anoint us and take care of us through this journey of life thank you for giving us life thank you for giving us life and now you've give us eternal life so Lord what more do we have to praise your father that that you thought enough of us to to bring Lord eternal life to each and every one of us father we pray that you'd forgive us of our sins today and our many mistakes be to the family their brother Dutch Scots of losing the young brother Lord you're the Prince of Peace and lord I pray that you'd give them peace that passes all understanding father and give them solace in time of trouble that you would be with that whole family Lord and just take care of them hold them in your mighty arms Lord we can ask for nothing else money couldn't buy nothing you just hold them in your arms Lord and be with them father look just take care of each one today bless us Lord in Jesus name we pray amen I also remember sister June and I and en and Toby are gonna leave this afternoon right after service we're going to her dad's house since we're off tomorrow so tomorrow's Presidents Day if you didn't know that the government gives me time off on on Presidents Day so revelation 6 verse 12 and I beheld we had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth this untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places all this has got something to do with nature all right and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid himself themselves in dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne that ones sitting on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated in Lord as my singing this morning my brother Dale let me just Adam just let you think about something you know if it's pouring down rain and thunder and lightning you don't want to be on the building you want to be in the building and that's what he's talking about with this throne you don't want to be on the throne things can happen but once you're in the throne you're protected by whatever sitting there on that throne man so you're protected you're not on you're in you're in this building and we have the protection of this building so I don't want to be I don't want to be found on Christ the Bible says in Christ amen I want to be found in him having not my own righteousness so here we are with this sixth seal we're talking last Sunday about the two prophets and the two prophets I've seen about this yesterday you know we look at the two prophets and we know that it is the it's the Ministry of Moses and Elijah right amen so so we can see now that even like brother Branham said that that wants to seal open that it became a brand-new book and then you could take the seals all the way back into the Bible and Easter you can go all the way back into Genesis with the seals amen so we look and see that who was in the book of Genesis was Abraham Abraham and all those coming down through as what type different types then you see you go on in a little bit further in the Bible and you see a man named Elijah come in then you see the man called moisés there before elijah we see all that coming in and Leviticus said because it's down to Samuel and into the Kings and we see these people there I don't want to say this I'm trying to say it the way I thought it but you know the seal didn't open in the Old Testament we know that but a precursor to that did open because there stands Moses Moses does all this right here turns from now to blood and does all these things then a man called the Elijah comes on the scene he stands on the scene in the Old Testament and he's calling no rain for three and a half years he's calling all these different plagues Moses so the sixth seal is not something I don't want any of the seals to be something I wanted to be theirs it is mysterious and it is but it's happened all the way down through the time through the Bible the seals are all the way from Genesis all the way to the Book of Revelations you see parts of the seal maybe not the part that's open because see we don't we don't even see the opening of the sixth seal in its natural state because we're not here when the two prophets or doing their doing their job right so but we must see it open in our form the form we can see it so we look back in the Old Testament that thrilled me because then then what you do is you just you don't you're not so narrow minded and say well they just all happen in the book of Revelation no it didn't just happen in the book of revelations it was spoken all the way down even when Cain slew Abel because of his doctrine there was a doctrinal issue back in the book of Genesis the very first chapter one two and three four down in there there was a doctrinal issue that they killed over amen so we see the seals then all the way down through time coming all the way through even into the church ages we see little pieces of it but the very opening of that sixth seal is going to be when we leave here we're going out of here and then it's gonna that's when it's going to happen the two prophets the two prophets I I don't see how that they can begin preaching until we leave because they are to the Jews only they have nothing to do with us we are it is totally as brother Branham says you know see the bride anywhere in this it's just to Israel all right the two prophets are not Gentile prophets they're Jewish prophets remember they won't take I you send whoever you want to over there Israel will only believe their people especially when you're trying to convert 144,000 staunch Jews that are over there now I mean they're there now if we think and we know we don't think we know the end is not too far away even if it's ten years from now that the people everyone I was thinking about this every actor in the play is on the stage we're not waiting for Jesus to be born you understand what I'm saying we're not waiting for the two witnesses to get born naturally born they're here they're somewhere over there and they're waiting they may be just walking through life doing their job building this building that building car doing whatever and then all of a sudden when we leave that anointing is going to strike them amen so what is this whole sixth seal waiting on to open its wait know me and you to get out of here a man is waiting on us to leave here get the supernatural part of that seal get the Thunder cuz see they don't get the Thunder we get the Thunder their thunder or their opening of the seal is what that that part of that is the opening of that seal brother I'm finished those two prophets so there's not a mystery when they come forth they're already in the Bible tells you exactly how long they're gonna preach 1260 days no more no less tells you who they are the two witnesses ministry of Moses and Ministry of Elijah and it will be verified and vindicated all right I you know I I did a few years ago preached on the cup of Elijah and they Trucy there they go back in need it's kind of odd they take Malachi the Jews take Malachi for but not the way we have it the Jews day Malachi 4 is Elijah's got to show up before the Great and dreadful dreadful day of the Lord that's what the Bible says well that's Old Testaments that you got to remember the Jews over there don't use the New Testament so they may study it and first one thing another but that's to them it's not a book it's the Old Testament so you got to go into the Old Testament see them up works for Moses and Elijah then come up to Malachi and says in the days the divorce I mean nothing that he's divorce that's more that's revelation but it says behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord will they're waiting on that Elijah amen our eyes have been open to know who that Elijah is they missed number four all right but they're getting number five which is going to be the same ministry continued on same message same ministry continued on into the next Elijah but they're looking for Elijah to come they have five cups it's cursed range the five comings of Elijah Elijah Elijah join the Baptist brother Branham and the one going to Israel that's five they have five cups of Elijah in their ceremony in Israel so see they're so close though that they missed that Malachi though Malachi 4 we get that we're gone that one takes us away before the great and dreadful day of the Lord and then you got to go over though and see then they got to start the tomb you know what the two prophets are going to do they're going to turn them from that Old Testament thought that's why God had to take you and change your thought from that old way to the new way so he's going to take that those two prophets they're not gonna walk in there start quoting Galatians and Ephesians and they're gonna go just like Paul did Paul went into the Old Testament brought Jesus Christ right out of the Old Testament and gave it to the Gentiles well what's an Elijah gonna do to the Jews he's going to go in that Old Testament remember what is it in Zechariah or wherever we read not too long ago where it says where did you get those scars they'll take them right to that scripture they'll take them to Malachi 4 and say look you missed that one I believe they do have a ministry but I believe they do know that brother Branham came I do believe that God's gonna have to reveal them to them that brother Branham has already come and preached his part because you got to deal with Malachi 4 when he deals with Micah for them two prophets are gonna say look John the John the Revelator spoke of us whether you believe it or not he spoke of us coming and there is even two olive trees spoke of in the Old Testament alright cuz this is what it says we're going to read it in just a little while but just to get you to see that to me the sixth seal just kind of keeps opening up a little more and opening up a little more and opened up a little more because you got to remember one thing brother Branham preached his heart out on the sixth seal priest is hired out wanted to preach on the trumpets wanted to preach on the seven trumpets he kept saying I want to get a building I wanted to do this and then God had to show him somewhere between there and the Feast of the trumpets trumpets that he preached showed him that he had already preached it supernaturally in the sixth seal so all of those trumpets sound under the sixth seal he had already preached them supernaturally so that's what you and I need to see we need to see even though brother Dale or myself or brother Aaron or brother Bob did a good job wings did not give him another hand mani did a good guy bro Lewis and all the ones look at him see them all coming together that's God speaking to us and when it's God speaking to us then we can stand and know that there's a further 'men of the ministry that there's a supernatural element underneath anything whatever we're talking about there's a supernatural element that you've got to catch that's the Thunder that's the voice of God that speaks to you listen the thunders not for everybody when Paul got struck down on the road to Damascus did everybody hear the voice Paul heard the voice because he was predestinated to hear the voice and then Jesus stood one day Bible said it thundered right said some heard a voice but they didn't hear what he said you and I and surely maybe people that's associated around us that may hear a thunder they may hear hear a rumbling but they're not gonna hear the voice you and I are gonna hear the voice of God speaking to each and every one of us and when you take that voice and then you apply it to your life that's why the trumpets we'll get into it in just a minute we'll talk about just for the trumpets for a little while because that's what we based our message on today is the trumpet brother branham said the trumpet is a is a war it's a scriptural war I'll read it to you it when a trumpet sounds it's a scriptural war you said no it calls it yeah it calls is really go listen when they were out in the battlefield look the only place before we had all this electronic stuff the only way that a the only way that a army could communicate with itself was blowing a trumpet you remember the Calvary and them in the John Wayne movies some have tears like John Wayne who wasn't like John Wayne movie things like oh no your other jog like John Wayne movie anyway and that's all right no big deal but they were sound a certain trumpet you know the retreat or you sound the trumpet knew in advance that sound the trumpet and something would happen every time a trumpet sounded but you had to know what that trumpet meant other than that you just heard his rugby blow that's the same way it is now and thinking while bob was preaching it you know everybody knew who Joseph was remember he's preaching wins now everybody knew who Joseph was because he was the smartest guy I mean he was the Pharaoh basically said Joseph you take care of the country and I'm just gonna you know I'm just gonna sit in here and be the king I mean you know if you had to get the Pharaoh you got to Joseph but they didn't get all the intricacies of Joseph number one they didn't know he was a Jew at first right they didn't know his daddy at giving the coat of many colors they in Egypt the world didn't know what I'm saying I'm saying to you as you walk through the world so I was thinking when he was preaching when you walk through the world there's a lot more than just Samuel Dale being the pastor spoken word church and he lives in Guilford Georgia there's a lot more goes to that you talkin coat of many colors you talkin about experiences in life and I'm saying all of you see when this sixth seal opens it's a total disruption of nature it's the total disruption of your nature the nature that you used to have should be dead but there is still a nature that you got to work on amen there still is a nature that we work on because you have to put that statue of a perfect man right in this sixth seal and we'll talk about that a little bit later so let's read a few quotes number one the sixth seal burger for 125 let's just read the read and this is just all we're doing backgrounding right here for a second compare scripture of this great event that will see this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now the great mystery now we know the mystery on the surface the mystery the seal the part that had it sealed was those two prophets but underneath there there's something we need to understand it's not going to put us in the rapture just to know that the two prophets or Moses and Elijah and they're going problems our 1260 days that's all in the Bible but it's how that a prophet come and sounded the trumpet in the end time to get me and you out of here to take us home to get us out of the way so that the two prophets can come so it has to be then the book of redemption now we always now listen we try to think sometimes be a little narrow minded that the book of redemption is that New Testament man that's what book of redemption started in the book of Genesis it's the book of redemption it's not the New Testament of redemption if the whole book of Redemption which is the whole sixty-six books in the Bible you know right but sometimes we go well with I was born again because I read acts 2:38 alright that's okay but there's more there's more if that Old Testament hasn't been there look at all the types and shadows we could never use think about how many times we type and use the Old Testament and you got to remember one thing's for sure Paul didn't have a New Testament to write from he was writing the New Testament from the Old Testament scrolls that he took on the backside of the desert and read them and brought Jesus Christ out of that we say well no that was just a bunch of lambs and a bunch of this in a bunch that was all speaking across a man so that's what you and I want sweets when we start seeing this see oh let's let's look number one on the surface we have to look at the earthquakes the blood the fire the smoke and all these things because that's what's naturally going to happen but that's not going to help us I just thank God that we're going to be going when all that's happening cuz that's a literal happening but now under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the sixth seal altogether is one great big book six crows because remember look six seals finishes Redemption with some that last Sunday the six seal at all six seals finishes Redemption because the Seventh Seal there's nothing written there's no motion there's no action there's no it's just silence in heaven for spacing 1/2 an hour that's all it was that's not what's rolled up in the book that is the book that is the book the Seventh Seal is the book you can't do away with the Seventh Seal but the six seals these six sails finishes Redemption all right same as we were talking last Sunday about the six fold purpose of Daniel the six seals parallels perfectly with the six fold purpose because what puts us into Millennium is what puts Israel in the Millennium everybody got that same an remember we're talking about the seventy weeks of Daniel and how that people have it all messed up they just don't understand what brother Aaron was talking about because you can't bring in everlasting righteousness during the Battle of Armageddon you just can't you can't place it you can't place all these like the last three of the six fold purpose now we'll read it in a minute but doing away with iniquity and sin and all that stuff I can see the two prophets standing on earth doing a ways by the Word of God doing away with the sins of 144,000 but now that's for just 1260 days that's not for seven years that's just for 1260 days amen but their stuff goes on after that and that's what the people to message don't see there is only 1260 days of Jesus's ministry left on the earth no doubt no doubt but there are seven years left to finish the seventy weeks of Daniel now that's according to the Bible so if you want to argue all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take you to Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are determined to do what six things once so six things are finished then their Redemption is over just kind of plain and simple but look it's just six Scrolls roll they're in unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth now see he brings a whole earth the whole earth is redeemed under this under this seal demands that all right we're gonna take a look take a look take my time a little bit today that's just okay number two the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period so we're when we start reading these trumpets and start paralleling the trumpets no one thinks for sure it will happen during that time that those two prophets are preaching there buddy got that say ma'am Amen all right the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period that's what takes place the bride is gone and there's no living creature nothing there to say it now God is not dealing with the church no more now we've already established that I just want to read it again it's been gone remember we go up in Revelations for one alright not seeing the revelations 19 this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelations 11 remember Israel is a nation God's servant nation and when when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom ages were David the son of David sits on the throne and as brother day I was talking about this morning if you'll go back in the Old Testament that is the promise is in the Old Testament that the son of David there would not be a time that there wouldn't be a son of David on the throne well what's he going to do he's gonna come back into his part of his kingdom set on a literal throne and judge the twelve tribes of Israel that's what it says in the Old Testament the son of David which will be Jesus Christ will sit there judging the twelve tribes of Israel are the 144,000 twelve times twelve in the Millennium done all right and we'll be there on a honeymoon his bride on the honeymoon we're not there to any kind of national affair or anything sure we can talk and do things but it's not for us we've already fulfilled everything we need to fulfill you said no what about the future home the future was just an event you've got the future home inside of you today because it says it was a bride adorned for her husband you got your part of the future home the streets are going to live on the house you're gonna live in it's inside of you now so we're done once we get once we get this thing changed we're done there's nothing else no gain or loss or you know we don't need another property to come and tell us the same thing we don't need the two witnesses to come and tell us anything 144,000 it's just going to be a wonderful day that when we go into that temple when they build that temple and we go in as the anointing of the temple that's what brother Branham said that were the anointing to the temple then what's going to happen is that temple is going to be set up for an example outer Court justification inner court sanctification our outer Court inner Court and Holy of Holies baptism the Holy Ghost we can explain to anybody that walks up hey this is what God wanted you to build but this is not why he was building he was building this the outer court the inner court and the Holy of Holies and then so there you're just a walking timer and ankle and then you're a walking city you're in tricera I'm liking what brother Dale says we're looking for something to come when it's already here I mean the reason the future homes not coming down right now it's because scriptures got to be fulfilled I mean it's proven they got to be 144,000 brought out of Israel so that's got to happen then there's got to be a millennium then there's got to be a battle of dog you may God all that's gotta happen before the future home come but you've already got the future home in you now you are the future home there will be no one in that future home except you that lives there no one else will live there now people can come in and people can leave but no one else would us in the 144,000 which will be eunuchs or servants in that city no one else will be in that city why cuz they're not part of it you're part of it you are that City all right let's go to number three if it is so now for we know that this sixth seal is the judgment seal so true now we're going to read in the trumpet where all this is going to happen to the world this is a worldwide event worldwide event this is not just going to happen in a little spot called Israel no it's a worldwide event all right the six cells of judgment still even the foolish virgin are going to be hunted down and killed there's going to be people killed during this 1260 days that these two prophets like I said before the nation's watch them when they die and send gifts to each other so the whole world knows about what's going on all right because really let's thinking let's think in our terms right now if you had two guys standing in one place I don't think they're all gonna both be together the whole time you know when one waltz turn no they're gonna be out in the city but don't you think that the Mossad CIA FBI Kremlin whoever what is that how'd you know that KGB you look a little Russian to me brother the KGB no don't you think they're gonna want to kill them two guys there's only two guys it's not like a million is two and they know who they are because that guy got the Moses goes I test this turn out River in the red blood and this thing just becomes red don't you think they'll know who they are they're not going to be doing this in secret what I'm saying but for 1260 days that anointing is going to be on them where they cannot die if we can get that anointing and understand that anointing you and I'll do the same thing amen but it's promising that it's not promised we're gonna die it's promised we're gonna go up in the sky mmm till the six seals the judgement seal judgment seal exactly what it is we have the anti-castro seen the church go now it's finished then with the martyrs of them Jews back there under the altar he's working his way through the seals now here is the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove it to you they are Jews and not Gentiles they have nothing to do with the bride not a thing and that's correct they're not brought their 144,000 their servants they're not bribed remember Israel we went through that whole part where Israel give up he divorced them they cannot be his wife anymore he can't take back a woman that has been defiled he can take her back to be a wife all right we done seen the bride go we can't place that anywhere else don't come back until the nineteenth chapter of the book of we know that's the book of Revelation now notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word the man so we know then this sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word and where does judgment begin at the house of God so we're under that six seal right now our part of it we're under our part of the sixth seal every time you come in church every time you read the word every time somebody we talk about things and and and it brings a judgment the judgment seal of the words all right let's go now to revelations and this read and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days that's 12 hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees now I didn't reference that but there's talks of two olive trees I believe over in Aaron Richard asked Aaron for those of you that weren't there last night there was a question if you had a question or if you were playing this game and you needed a lifeline you needed somebody to call who would it be call well it was scattered all over the place but definitely Richard was gonna call Aaron and several other people is gonna call Aaron so so anyway but no it does talk about in the Old Testament about the two olive trees all right so it's not something not something exclusive to the New Testament these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy which was Elijah and have power over waters to turn them to blood which is Moses and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will remember one thing before natural Israel was let go out of Egypt what happened plagues fell all the plagues fell before Israel left Egypt same way with you and I same way with 144,000 God's just continued in his continuity all the way through and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them let can I interpolate just a moment that's all right go to 9 Daniel 9 and he shall make confirm the covenant with many for what one week that's why there's one week left after the rapture one week but in the midst of the week he will cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease that's it right there told there's 1260 days left of the Ministry of the two prophets once they're finished that man is going to kill them in the middle of that week of that last week they he is going to kill them and then what's gonna happen the Battle of Armageddon is gonna happen once the 144,000 go into rapture there's a Battle of Armageddon gonna happen right and look that's not gonna be a one day battle we were talking about this other day listen that's not a one day battle that's nuclear destruction just for a tidbit of information it may take three years before everybody dies after the Battle of Armageddon it's not gonna be like the Battle of Gog and Magog where God's gonna go come down and just kill the souls he's just gonna take care of everything wipe it all off God's fire is much hotter than a nuclear fire but this is a nuclear explosion and there will be time for it that's why I say the 70 weeks of Daniel can in that's the Battle of Armageddon there's still time and what do you believe that or not go back to the Bible there's one week left in the signing of that treaty and then in the midst of the week it'll be cut off and he's going to kill the two prophets once he kills the two prophets what's going to happen they're gonna what raise up in three and a half days and then they're going in a rapture then what's gonna happen then they're gonna start pressing the buttons everybody's going to be mad at everybody else and they're just gonna start mashing nuclear power nuclear weapons you're gonna well you're not but they're gonna see things that has never been seen before amen all right so now let's go to the next number four is everybody all right ma'am I like what Bob said Wednesday night don't guess what that little tidbit he said Wednesday not about being bored because of all this information somebody's giving us on the seals I know you talking about me Bob right down Berlin template tell movies but that's alright this is what's putting this together so that we can understand and it may be boring to some and I've never been bored by teaching I love teaching I exciting to watch teaching this book sometimes just all that other that I I'm in because you know why I want to learn and in learning you need somebody teaching you need somebody to break it down you need somebody to do that and and you know he gives us all gifts to use and I hope the god were using them everybody's using them right cuz we need all five we need all five not just one I could say something awful good right here I just did but I guess I'll hold it till tomorrow night and have power over the waters to turn them to blood smite the earth who places off to do with what is it what can bring these things but the word now look you would have thought he would have took that process and said you'll moved it what can bring these things but the two prophets that's not what he said he said what can bring these things but the word listen those two prophets are not just going to stand there and be totally let totally illiterate God is going to anoint the word that they have just like God is going to anoint come on people God's going to anoint the word just like here no it's the word for you he's going to anoint the word that you have it one day we're going to have enough word to anoint to take this thing and change it but that's exactly what they're doing they can do nature any way they want to here it is they're the one who brings on this sixth seal they uncover and open up now they're not gonna stand over there and go where the sixth seal and we're gonna open it up no they're going to teach those 144,000 and like I said before it's not just gonna be 100 it's not just gonna be two prophets with all the word and nobody else there's a hundred and forty-four thousand gonna sit in a congregation or stand somewhere listening to what they say and that word is gonna be come alive alive in their heart and they're gonna be able to speak they're gonna be to do what these do I just believe that but these are two prophets they're the ones that bring it on they're the ones that open that seek seal now once you open the seal it's not private anymore it's public once you open the seal once you look what we said before once you pull that sail off look you can read everybody can read it amen that's what we're doing now that's the one who brings on the sixth seal they uncover and open it it's the power of God to interrupt nature see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature because that's all it talks about its nature natural things all right do you get it now there's your seal who does it it's the prophets the other side of the rapture your brother Rama is placing them after the rapture the two prophets if you have any doubt given to prophets are on the other side of the rapture with the power of God the Word of God like I say they're not justice come come up one day and stand out in the middle of what's the minute like in the middle of Jerusalem that I'm just gonna stand on the street and go rain fire hail earthquake no they're going to start preaching the gospel and in preaching the gospel is going to bring these things to pass you ever thought about this what's gonna cost California the st. cuz god just one day figured he's gonna flip a switch and that California's gonna hit to hit the ocean I noticed last night did you all know this last night Terence read the question said where would you take your wife on a honeymoon if you had three destinations one was Paris one was Honolulu and one was Los Angeles nobody chose Los Angeles for some silly reason nobody chose Los Angeles so anyway but they're doomed to look what weep we snigger about it but listen that's millions of people gonna die real quick but it's because of what they did and God knew they would and he put a prophet on the earth just like the two prophets that's doing over there that prophet stood and condemned Los Angeles so Los Angeles will go under the ocean amen but it hadn't yet why because we're still here so who's gonna bring home that earthquake I am the I am is gonna do it who can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood Sun can go down or anything at their command they man there you are there you are see see how the seals open down there in the church age is how it showed the martyrs and now here's these two prophets standing here with the Word of God to do anything the nature they want to and they shape the earth now I believe they're going to shape the earth with the gospel first it has to be like I said about a trumpet a trumpet denotes a battle a scriptural war when Luther came on the scene a trumpet sounded a spiritual war happened if you don't believe that I'm got the quote right here I'll read it to you just a minute or either I got it I left it back there for next Sunday and it shows us actually who does it is Moses and Elijah because there's their ministry re impersonated again both men oh my do you see it now to see what the sixth seal is it's those two prophets now notice don't let it choke you but watch what open that seal prophet you know why he said don't let it choke you because there's two the prophet behind that pulpit making that statement and he was opening the seals to a Gentile Church he's not a he's not a Jew proper Jewish prophet he's a Gentile prophet to a Gentile Church so he was talking to me and you see Amen there you are old we're living in the eagle day see he's he's identifying it right there we're living in the eagle day brother head up among the clouds they opened that seat sealed they have power to do it there's your sixth seal coming open then alright man alright next let's talk let's look at Daniel right here seventy weeks of determine let's just just for a second then we'll get into the into the trumpets thereby alright seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to do six things one finished transgression to make an end of sin three mate reconciliation for iniquity and I stopped right there in the red because you can't bring in everlasting righteousness with all heck breaking loose under the Battle of Armageddon bringing in everlasting righteousness brother Brown says it's going heading toward into the Millennium that's bringing the everlasting Roxton listen that's what the Jews are looking for they never heard remember what sounded what sounded before the 50th Jubilee was to take place a trumpet they never got that trumpet sounded to bring in their Jubilee their Jubilee was the Millennium that they never got to now they had the land that would rest in there for seven years you had something happen but the Bible says in Leviticus I'm going through and reading Leviticus again to get the feast days in all down but what happened seven Sabbath's which is 49 and then you haloth the fifth and then the trumpet sound for the 50th Jubilee they never they never never celebrated the fifty why because you had to give everything back that you had and it's you ain't gonna do that a natural Jews not but as spirituals you will and then so what's going to happen the two prophets are going to preach 1260 days to finish the transgression of Israel cuz this is to the Jews this is Daniel and thy people in the holy city right now people Jews and upon thy holy city comes remember there's a city to be built according to Ezekiel 40 44 there's a Millennial temple to be built by the Jews they're burnt right with that same man so that thy holy city because look if they drop a bomb in the Vatican remember they go atomic bomb they're not going to leave Israel out they gonna drop one down that mosque of Omar and the whole city of Jerusalem is just going to be flat rubble so that's really not talking about that city because he's restoring not destroying he's restoring so they got to build that Millennial temple yeah they got to have the seven years left because three and a half of it took up by bringing Israel back to their Day of Atonement they got to come to that day of atonement you and I had to come to a day of atonement not the killing of the Lamb but to realize that Christ already a man Christ already died for you he didn't have to in 2000 and or in 1998 he didn't have to crawl up on the cross and die for me again no I had to realize it under the feast of atonement under that day of atonement there was a day I realized that Christ had already died for me you don't riku the laments of mourning for the kill that's already happened so what's the to profit is going to do they're not going to preach Christ is going to be crucified and Christ is going to come he's already come they've already killed they killed their lamb 2,000 years ago it was my lamb too but the two prophets has to tell them that's where you turned him down so what finish the transgression where did they transgress right there at Calvary where do they make their sin let his blood be on us in our children brother brown sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity he said that's where God had to literally blind their eyes so that you and I could come in amen literally blind in their eyes so you and I could come in so he had to do this God had to save Israel he said I'll never forget him right I'll never forget him how can a woman I read you the scripture what about that how can a woman had a baby deny that she had a baby can't do that so how could God deny that he had this wife at one time but he divorced her but that was his children though that was his people then after the 1260 days the middle of the 70th week he comes to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy because it won't be prophesying I won't be prophesying anymore it'll be a reality listen Malachi 4 is not a prophecy it's already come to pass and to anoint the most holy and if you'll read your Daniel 7 2 weeks book brother Brahim said the anoint the most holy is us walking into the Millennial temple going into the Millennium so the six fold purpose puts them in the Millennium we get a revelation of the revelation of the six seals we're going to take a rapture that's there for redemption because look they're full redemption listen mine and your full redemption is for this thing to be changed amen we are not guaranteed a city we're not even guaranteed a piece of land but they are thy people and upon thy holy city there's only one holy city to garden that's Jerusalem so he's gonna actually restore them and concede look we don't get a promise he's not gonna restore the United States of America yet we are a nation yeah we're supposed to be a godly nation yet we have land we're not promised that but Israel is promised that seventy weeks are determined upon thy people upon thy holy city in other words to bring all of it by that millennial temple is not going to be built in China or the United States it's gonna be built right there right there in Jerusalem so he's going to restore the people in the 1260 days then the Battle of Armageddon is going to happen and then whatever you think happens that here's my thought done listen a Jew can only build a temple we can't build temples we don't know how we'll have build temples but Jews from the day they were born knows that there's an out of court and the court in the holy Holies and what the dimensions are so what if 144,000 comes back down here and builds the temple while we're still up there and then we come walking right back into that temple and head right into the Millennium how beautiful is that cuz that my brides not gonna build my house right I'm gonna play somebody to build it I'm gonna have a higher servants all right so I said we're in a honeymoon we don't have to do anything that's the bride of Jesus Christ but I believe in 144,000 and you can say whatever you want to about the fifth seal Jew heathen I you know this is not a for us to discuss and the talk about the seals but take him build that temple and then here we come right down into it and we're the anointing to the temple how about that what a time lays ahead for us now let's look at where brother Branham talks in number five in the 70th year of Daniel our 70th week rather coming to an end of sin put it away you understand now what's the first to finish the transgression you make them end of sin number three to make reconciliation for iniquity use writing it down had about six scriptures going on down look number 86 to make reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliation because remember he's the only one that can reconcile because he's one it blinded him right here look he made reconciliation but it will not be applied to them in other words at Calvary they turned him down so the the 2000 years of a Gentile Church was not to Israel they're getting their 1260 days later why it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it and why didn't they blind you say well maybe today I'm because I'm blind you're willfully blind they were blind because God blinded them you're willfully blind if you're blind there's no reconciliation for you but that there is reconciliation when Daddy when the father puts his hand over the kids eyes and says I got to take a Gentile bride but you know what I'm going to release my hand one day there's gonna be 1260 days and I'm going to preach and bring 144,000 people out of this chaos and I'm going to put them in a millennium let's go the neck from face of the trumpets now this may get a little technical so I may slow down just for a few minutes that's all right if I'm boring you you can go home okay Pentecost feast finished at the period of the seventh trumpet pay attention for the next is the coming of the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ because what is the seventh seal the seven seals are coming to the Lord okay all right that's why that one there seventh trumpet they get the coming of the Lord they don't get to coming we get but they still get a comment the Lord has to come and pick them 144,000 and two people up and take them in a rapture they don't pick themself up and go in the rapture of God has to come and pick them up and take them in a rapture so they do get a coming for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ and also the trumpet is sound for the Jews now remember we hear listen to me we hear a gospel trumpet that's what births you into the body on your day of Pentecost you have a day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell on you hey man you got a damn Pentecost so we're live well now listen we're living now under the Feast of the Tabernacles Tabernacles not booths they have a literal day where they sit in the booth for so many days no God lived in your booth there are six trumpet is sound and when it does it makes known to them the revealed Son of God one half-hour silence remember all trumpet sound on this sixth seal the sixth seal finishes the mystery under the sixth seal just before the seventh is open now listen remember a trumpet when they trumpet sounds it denotes a spiritual or scriptural war but there was a trumpet that sounded for Israel to get up and move or stop remember the priest would stand out blow the trumpet and we would move the pillow fire would move the priest would see it come on that's what's happening now the ministry catches the pillar of fire moving blows the trumpet on Sunday morning Sunday afternoon winds then wherever time you match play because it's the scriptural war a spiritual war so all trumpets sound under the sixth seal so all of our trumpets everything we need is going to end on the 6l6 hill finishes redemption how can you go any further than that our redemption though is a body changed their redemption is to go to messengers going over there preaching 1260 days and bringing them what to the feast of atonement all right okay Pentecost feast finished at the period of seventy seventh trumpet so look the feast of Pentecost on that when the day of Pentecost was fully come 2,000 years ago own not on zoos the street I'm talking about 2,000 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell on 120 that was literally on the day of Pentecost by the Jewish time and by the Jewish calendar Christ was absolutely killed on the day of Passover the next day was the feast of unleavened bread the next day was the feast of firstfruits because he's the first one to come up out of the ground I love it first when they come upon the ground and then fifty days later from the Passover he comes back on the day of Pentecost and comes into the believer that's why Penta is 5 Pentecost 50 all right so on the day of Pentecost we got our Pentecostal feast they're gonna get their Pentecostal feast amen they gotta get a Pentecostal feast they gotta get the new birth they missed the one I've got a quote but it's I don't want to read it and I need to take some time with her brother BAM explains that see we got our feast of Pentecost then he but he wasn't to them he blinded their eyes as a nation so that Feast of Pentecost went to them they're waiting on their feast of Pentecost but you and I got to come to what Feast of Tabernacles to get out of here so that God can come back and give them their Pentecostal feast cuz they've not had their Pentecostal feast before but the 144,000 will have a Pentecostal feast amen there may okay with that and I noticed a lot of information but it's leading up to the trumpets just before the seventh seal is open because remember I'll read you a quote in a minute maybe at the very end where brother Branham says the seventh seal is the same as the seventh trumpet the seventh seal to us is the same as the seventh trumpet to Israel it will will not read that today's save time I don't want to take much more time but let's read them number okay here's here's the trumpets and we may get into a few of them I may read them and then we can go back over that okay I don't want to hold you much longer than than an hour so and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets so these are angels that were given seven thereby wagga seven trumpets thank you that was the whole roll back there went let's have a resurrection I know it's hot it's hot up here we just ate and bless your heart I know it's tough but listen I'll let y'all come up here and preach it it'd be exciting for you to throw into it you won't go sleep I promise there's something if we listen now let me just stop right here brother's gonna gonna get a car lounge they ought to be a bathroom allowance for that room right in there brother brother Terrence deal so this is hard you got Bob said get a bucket where's he from where's he from Monica does he I'm not even an ass I'm gonna ask get a bucket now mate are you waiting now by the way okay extra Williams a face so red for how much your daddy not you so here we have seven angels that are given seven trumpets so they're given seven different things they got to do all right but now watch what all seven are well we're gonna read most of them and at all parallels right what's gonna happen because remember all trumpets all of them sound under the sixth seal and the sixth seal is those two prophets who prophesy 1260 days right no man well caught up here now and another eight that's why that's why brother Brown said God told him he preached these supernaturally he didn't read these but supernaturally under that seal he preached every one of these because he was going to take each one and he said the Lord spoke to him and said they're not for you they're not the trumpets are not to you they're to the Jews so then brother Brown comes and does a masterful job and preaching the Feast of the Trump as he brings them all into that one all right and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto Him much incense that he should offer it with prayers because remember what is incense incense is the prayers of the Saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne now remember this is a scene and the smoke of the incense which came up with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand now remember we're not there we're in another dimension we're the bride this has nothing to do with us now spiritually we can read this and see that that happens to us in a form or in a way but that is not talking about the prayers of the saints it's not us we're already gone it's the prayers of the saints that stopped still on the ground still down on the earth and the smoke of the incense which came up with the prayers the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth where there were voices and thunderings and lightnings quite and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound listen you don't hear it you hear a voice brother they'll read each other day John heard a trumpet heard the voice turn to see he wasn't don't stand over and see a guy blowing a horn the only saw a man a guy with a message Christ the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth now look this is all done this is all natural and the third part of the trees were burnt up and all green grass was burnt up and the second angel sounded as it were a great mountain burning with fire remember what we read in Revelations what the two prophets were to do hold that right there and I'm gonna read them and I beheld when it opened the sixth seal you don't go back to it brother in the back there was a great earthquake we already figured that out got an earthquake up here something became black and the moon became as blood stars of heaven fell upon the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs like shake another way when heavens departed as a scroll every mountain and Island were moved out of their places cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood we just read it around here so it's the same parallel awful time because remember this is this is the wrath of God poured out on a sinless world now there's a 144,000 protected and - you got to including them two problems 144,000 and two that's protected nobody else is there getting all these plagues even the foolish virgin everybody and the second angel sounds that were a great mountain burning with fire is cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died why because they can't have awful blood how how horrible was that gonna be and the third part of the ships were destroyed a third of all the ships in the world are gonna be destroyed and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven that's what we're reading right here and stars of heaven fell to the earth burning as it were a lamp they've always said for years that asteroids or the you know would hit the earth and they said that's what happened back they say what caused all this you know the dinosaurs to die and all that stuff no I want an asteroid it was the flood it was the wrath of God at the beginning same thing amen but if you'll notice he comes to a third party he doesn't he remember he promised he wouldn't destroy the world water anymore he's destroying it with everything this time and the third angel sounded a fella great star from heaven burning is where a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the Fountains of water and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood which is bitter and many of the men died of the water because they were made bitter so what listen you can live for a long time without food but you can't live with what seven days without water that's a short period of time you talk about from today till next Sunday you can't live that long without water now a lot of us can live without food for several months brother Krantz is smiling he says Amen some of us longer than others Christine would be in trouble sister Christine and the name of the star was wormwood third part of the water listen we laugh but this is literally going to happen to this earth because the wrath of God because God because man has turned guard down this is what's going to happen and the fourth angel sounded now listen all these are sounding while those two prophets are on earth because we're going to read here in a minute we can will prove that the 144,000 are still here during that time the fourth angel sounded the third part of the Sun was smitten in the third part of the moon third part of the stars and so was the third part of them was darkened the day show not right here and heaven departed as a scroll in every mountain and he says right here the Sun became black back as sackcloth of hair I'm reading the seventh co6 sealed so the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night lock once and I'll be held in her name jewel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound remember that's four that's three more to sound all right now look brother branham told us he's what these woes were world war one world war two and world war three twos already sounded this one is sounded under all coming to this now you're that's World War one but you got to remember World War one ended but what did it begin it began up World War two World War two is going to begin World War three because what everything's in place man is placing things in different places and then what's going to happen World War One World War two and then we're not gonna be here for World War three the bride will be gone 144,000 they're going to be gone ain't that gonna be a horrible time because when 144,000 and to leave this earth no Holy Ghost no one no man with a Christian born-again soul will be on this earth out of seven billion which probably won't be but about four billion once this is all over with there'll be that many people on earth and not one will be a Christian not one and I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound listen continue and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit this one's got a key and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit now watch the bottomless pit he'll write the bottomless pit as hell all right and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and to them was given power as the Scorpions of the earth have power anybody ever been bit by a scorpion yeah it feels good done it and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing to any tree but only those men which have not the seal of God in their forehead there's only one group of people during this period of time that has the seal of Gardner for you which is the holy ghost that's the 144,000 and - so there they are they're here during this whole time well we know that what the Bible is telling us is hurt everybody but those 144,000 and - yeah you can hurt everybody you won't - but them and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months in their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he struck at the man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their face was the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of women you know what brother Graham said about that anybody know what he said about that he said that's him alone he's tormenting them long-haired men and the short haired women I put the long-haired meaning because it is and the short haired women he said that's give them for their torment and their teeth as the teeth of lines and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots and many horses running to battle you think maybe that's a war fixing to happen to helicopters and airplanes we'll say well we won't see but maybe somebody tell us about it many horses running to battle and they had tails like in the scorpions and there were stings on their tails and their power was to hurt me in five months and they had a king over them which was the Angel of the bottomless pit so who is that that's the old devil but he's incarnate now and the Pope because remember this is during that time when woe is past and behold there come two woes more Hereafter all right let's read what brother branham said about this and then we'll close piece of the trumpet now this calling of the Feast of Trumpets the approaching of something notice revelations 8 7 if you want to write it down we noticed the first trumpet they're scattered hail blood fire upon the earth just exactly with exodus when God was calling his people out of the Exodus everybody understand that saying ma'am that's when Israel was in Egypt and all these plagues fell before they left all right same way it's going to happen to his people again all these plagues are going to happen before he takes his people all right now the reason that these seven trumpets there's not applied to this church and this age is because it's the Israel only it's the calling of the gathering of the people through the two witnesses and now there's only one significance in here that I want you to get to in a few minutes is where you'll see why this doesn't apply to these days that we're living in the seven trumpets the gathering of Israel is the trumpet the trumpets is to gather Israel notice the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail and everything scattered the ground what is he doing bringing Israel out of spiritual Egypt back into his homeland that's what happened to you that's what happened to you oh did you come in in the flower bed of these whether they're just a real wonderful thing when you came to the Lord yeah it was a wonderful thing when he came to the Lord the boy afterwards getting this gracious they wasn't days you felt like that was breaking loose on you if you hadn't you got it coming now let me say this right here cuz look I what calls Israel back to the homeland the trumpet what called us back to our homeland our homeland is not a place our homeland is the Word of God he caught the trumpet sounds to call us back to the Word of God alright now let me see right here every trumpet that blowed blown under the sixth seal we'll get to in a few minutes where we caught the seal all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal alright let's go to number eight still in the Feast of the trumpet notice the trumpet sounded and that was to gather them together now the first trumpet blow there was hail fire sprayed upon the earth just exactly like it wasn't Egypt make it ready to call them to the Day of Atonement they rejected the true atonement we just talked about that they rejected Calvary that was a true atonement listen that was a day of atonement back in the Old Testament that was a type that was a type called our day of atonement we reject they rejected the true atonement and this year has been linked these years has been lengthened out through has been the year of Pentecost so what's he saying we had Pentecost right here look we had Pentecost 50 days after Jesus died ascended come back on the day of Pentecost just went to the Jews they rejected this but they got to come to their feast of Pentecost but we've lived it's been a Pentecost all the way through 2,000 years of seven Church ages amen they've not had theirs so what they're going to do the two prophets are going to call them into the feast of Pentecost before they can receive the atonement they can't just mourn for for Jesus and don't know who he is they don't know who he is now but when they have their Pentecost when that man comes into their soul and then they call them to the feast of atonement where they they say oh my gosh we're in trouble we killed the very Masada we've been looking for and he says don't worry so where'd you get those scars he said in the house of my friends this has been the calling out of the church I'm sorry this years has been lengthened out through here has been the year of Pentecost II now sound now sounding for the Jews comes next God's not dealt with the Jews during this whole 2,000 years of church ages sure there's been some natural Jews come in sure but not the nation of Israel but he's getting ready to deal with them through two prophets what's God doing in the end time dealing with last - a prophet the Prophet the Lord Jesus Christ D profit I think about what Roosevelt was talking about you know the son of man denotes one person right I know collectively were the body but there was only one man that wasn't born from another man we're all sons we're all sons that were born from another man you understand what I mean I see a seed from an individual man brought into the bed and ground of the woman and then the son of man didn't have an earthly father so he's the son of man but now when you're born again and your bodies change you don't have an earthly father you know brother Branham said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brenham not denying his natural birth but he saw where his birth really took him to so I said that's just a point there just want to throw that in this has been the calling out of the church what's real close now which afterwards he took them to the land of promise which he took them to the promised land which he will do the same thing which in symbol he takes the church to the land of promise remember he takes us to the land of promise we're in Canaan but we got to fight for every inch on the ground that we got we gotta fight for it so will Israel alright let's go let's read another one number 9 I think this is the last one and then we'll then we'll stop note in Revelations tonight chapter xiii first now notice real close under the 6th trumpet revelations 9 13 under the 6th trumpet note there were two hundred thousand thousand of this is the 6th trumpet under the 6th trumpet right there were two hundred thousand horsemen is really two hundred thousand thousand horsemen that had been bound in the river of Euphrates was turned loose under the 6th trumpet now there's not two hundred thousand horsemen in the world but there are two hundred thousand horsemen I want you to jot this down so you can read it they weren't natural horses they breathe fire they had breastplates of jazz when they had tails in the end of their tail look like a serpent a snake's head on the end of a sting and see it was spiritual horses spiritual Devils Chargers that had been bound in Euphrates all these years supernatural demons what was it the old Roman Empire being revived the persecution of the Jews they had been bound for nearly 2,000 years at the river Euphrates can't cross to the promised land remember that boy this is wonderful remember the Tigris and Euphrates River runs right through where the Garden of Eden they couldn't cross over because of these demons you and I cross over into that Promised Land the Garden of Eden what brother I'm saying him in the cross mr. Gardner Bale the threefold purpose to take us where take us a bite to eat that was the last one take us back to the Garden of Eden Euphrates you know came to Eden I just did that can't cross the proper religious state that was trying to get to the other side Euphrates you know come through Eden but they were bound there two hundred thousand demons of persecution and notice what happened under that sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the Jews the persecution of the Jews supernatural Devils nearly 2,000 years then loosed by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews you said well that isn't Rome it's the same spirit they'd done the same thing they did to the Christians in the old pagan Roman days now watch the natural Israel and the spiritual church now as we separated here turned loose on the Jews now we know he can - that that quote continues oh but I wanted to stop right there for save time because of one region something else real quick right here they don't have this but if they can pick it up we were at you were asking some of you were looking a little stranger and brother Brown said this 1960 - is this a sign of the answer brother Brown said the sounding of the trumpet means gospel trumpet and the sounding of the trumpet in the Bible means get ready for a scriptural war scriptural war Paul said if you want to put this down first Corinthians 14 8 if the trumpet give an uncertain sound how will they man know what to prepare for and if it doesn't have a scriptural sound a vindicated indication of the Word of God made manifest how will we know where at the end time we've had that trumpet we know where we are Israel does not know where they are the world doesn't know where they are denominations don't know where they are we're the only people that have an absolute North Point and we're headed to that this is finally in 1962 paragraph 269 notice if it gives an uncertain sound unscriptural who can prepare himself but a trumpet did you notice each one of these ages that I told you about the church coming in there was a trumpet sounded a seal tore loose and a trumpet means war it fit don't give a scriptural sound what about it now Feast of the trumpets I'm going to read this real quick no more closed musicians come up piece of the trumpets 1964 paragraph 155 notice now exactly the continuty continuity of the scripture is actually the same under the seventh trumpet is to Israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church we find under the seventh seal that when those souls that were under the altar they receive robes they were given robes not that they learned them because they were in dispensation when God was still dealing with grace with the Gentiles not the Jews Israel is saved as a nation God deals with Israel as a nation Gentiles is a people all right Feast of the trumpets paragraph 222 see the atonement watch the atonement followed the trumpet sound they're gonna have to hear those two prophets that trumpet has got a sound they've got to hear the word of God to realize that the atonement has already been made the man so that's what they're going to preach you said one of them two prophets going to preach they're gonna preach Jesus Christ they gonna preach the Word of God they're going to preach they're not going to silver and bash their head and so how you miss it you bunch of dummies know they know they said hey your time is now this is just for you you know what if I was one of them two problems I jump up on the highest mountain I'd say come up here with me look all over the world there's nobody laughs but you know buddy Rome's not gonna get it they're gonna persecute you in other words but you're it you are 12,000 out of 12 tribes that's gonna get this message and that we're gonna leave this place don't worry Church we're going to leave this place whatever persecutions come and let it come but we're going to leave this place now look paragraph to 24 now the trumpets is to call them by it let's stand to our feet the purpose is to call them back to that atonement see the atonement they rejected and they rejected so that our eyes could be open theirs was closed and during this time those seals opened up and the trumpets blow and now in the blowing of the trumpets just before the Messiah comes because we've got to be and they've got to be in Palestine and you remember God had to harden Pharaoh's heart that's the same thing he done with Stalin and Hitler he hardened their heart to drive the Jews back to the homeland where the 144,000 is supposed to be let's listen one more from the rapture 1965 the message calls the bride together the shout and the trumpet the same one with a loud voice he screamed out with a shout in the voice in won't Lazarus and was a loud voice he cried Lazarus come forth and the voice Waits the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and the trumpet with the sound of the trumpet and when it does it calls always a trumpet called Israel to the feast of the trumpets which was a Pentecostal feast the great feast in the sky and the Feast of Trumpets now trumpet trumpet do announcer calling together now watch the assembling together the bride the feast of the trumpets the wedding supper we have seen it in time and I'm going to tell you you're gonna see it in its fullness and then there's your trumpets we'll go through the last three again because I want to get to that to that sixth trumpet again with the two hundred thousand thousand demons but listen we're living we're living in a great day we're living in a time where we should hardly have any questions about anything if you'll just study a little bit how in the world can God bring confusion how if you're confused it's not God that's pretty simple if you're confused about what I just said pray God said if you got the Holy Ghost I'll show you things to come I'll show you the word and if Brit listen if brother Branham preached it I believe we can preach it if he preached it it's not an exclusion we're included in this and we ought to be able to understand it I know nobody understood it while he was preaching it but he said they'd be a group that would they'd be some people standing in the endtime that would understand what's going on the seals would would open to us in its spiritual form it didn't back then that made to a prophet but it didn't he didn't have he didn't even have 104 much less 144,000 maybe maybe we maybe we shouldn't be have big heads never but we should realize that it's got to come through you this message has to made a life be made alive like I said last Sunday when Christ was on earth sure he had a physical flesh body but he had no church body he had no body he was the head but he had no body he had to come back in spirit form to build a body now he's got a body and now the head can come down on that body connect and take us out of here let's sing a song 3:11 everybody will be happy over there oh my goodness there's a happy land of promise
