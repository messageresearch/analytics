[0:14] Sam I leave
[0:48] always like read scripture enrollment 64
[0:52] we have a baptism service just listen to
[0:55] the wording of the scripture what shall
[0:58] we say then shall we continue in sin
[1:00] that grace may abound god forbid how
[1:03] shall we that are dead to see and live
[1:04] any longer therein so you not that so
[1:07] many of us as were baptized into Jesus
[1:09] Christ were baptized into his death
[1:12] therefore we are buried with me on by
[1:15] baptism of the Dead that like as Christ
[1:17] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[1:19] of the Father even so we also should
[1:23] walk in newness of life or if we have
[1:25] been planted together in the life isn't
[1:28] it dead we shall all be also in the
[1:31] likeness of his resurrection knowing
[1:33] this that our old man is crucified
[1:36] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:38] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:40] / he that is dead is freed from sin now
[1:44] if we'd be dead with Christ we believe
[1:47] that we shall also live with him knowing
[1:49] that Christ being raised the dead guys
[1:52] no more death has no more dominion over
[1:54] him or him that he died he died on
[1:56] descent once but in that he liveth he
[1:59] liveth unto God we don't believe in
[2:03] water baptism under regeneration but we
[2:07] believe that when you're baptized that
[2:09] you are showing for the world what you
[2:12] believe axel it stated are that if we're
[2:15] very with you in Baptism and that's what
[2:19] your baptism does it means that shows
[2:21] you go down into a break did you come
[2:26] back up out of there
[2:28] to walk in the newness of life that's
[2:31] what the water does it doesn't water
[2:33] doesn't clean cheering I guess what you
[2:35] believe but it is what you believe then
[2:38] what you believe in what it doesn't then
[2:39] it cleanse you and then you'll hear me
[2:43] say this because I just believe the
[2:46] scripture we baptized a little different
[2:50] than some people who some bitter are
[2:52] here to be baptized in the name of the
[2:56] Lord Jesus Christ because jesus said in
[2:59] Matthew 28 19 to go baptized in the name
[3:01] of the Father and of the Son
[3:05] they said name single for the name of
[3:09] father if you don't get a name out of it
[3:11] the name of the Father with the Lord the
[3:16] name of the son we know is cheap oh that
[3:19] did not
[3:20] and then the Holy Ghost would be crying
[3:22] so that's father son Holy Ghost Lord
[3:25] Jesus Christ then that fulfills
[3:28] description and you'll hear me saying to
[3:31] fulfill what Jesus said to baptize in
[3:34] the name of the Father the Son the Holy
[3:37] Ghost i baptize you in the name of the
[3:39] Lord Jesus because the father son Holy
[3:43] Ghost not a knight it's just a title
[3:48] i'ma father's parmesan I'm a human being
[3:51] but my manual family
[3:53] okay so we have to have a knife what he
[3:55] said to take tonight so we're buried in
[3:58] your life which is in work we're walking
[4:04] you to school I brother Maloney that you
[4:07] actually bless you can order
[4:46] according
[4:58] stormy banks i standing castaways 40

[5:14] who's it choose life
[6:08] to fulfill the Great Commission
[6:11] our Lord and saviors in the backpack
[6:13] Father and of the Son and

[6:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
