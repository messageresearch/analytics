[11:20] Revelations
[11:25] 1 and I turn to see the voice that spake
[11:28] with me and being turned I saw seven
[11:30] golden candlesticks in the midst of the
[11:32] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[11:34] of man clothed with a garment down to
[11:37] the foot and G about the pals with a
[11:39] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[11:41] were white like wool as white as snow
[11:45] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[11:48] his feet like UND fine Bry as if they
[11:51] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[11:54] sound of many Waters all right we'll go
[11:58] over to
[12:00] uh Genesis
[12:02] 1 because what we're going to do is try
[12:05] to go through I wanted was we were
[12:07] planning on having questions and answers
[12:09] Wednesday okay uh I just didn't seem to
[12:12] be right on that I wanted to make sure
[12:15] to review a lot of things with you to
[12:19] where that you would understand and then
[12:21] we'll have the questions and answers
[12:23] this afternoon all right so if you have
[12:26] anything write it down thoughts ideas
[12:29] comments questions write it down we'll
[12:32] try to get to it this afternoon okay
[12:35] Genesis
[12:36] 1:26 and God said let us make man in our
[12:40] image after our likeness and let them
[12:42] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[12:44] and over the foul of the A and over the
[12:46] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[12:49] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[12:51] the Earth so God created man in his own
[12:55] image in the image of God created he him
[12:59] male and female created he them you may
[13:03] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[13:05] the reading of the word all
[13:09] right now we covered a lot
[13:12] Wednesday trying to you know uh make
[13:17] sure you follow what I'm
[13:19] saying uh Paul said it's needful
[13:22] sometimes to say the same thing over and
[13:25] I pray that you don't get bored by
[13:28] hearing the same things being said but
[13:32] you know I want you to understand what I
[13:36] say all right and what I believe I don't
[13:40] hide anything I've never had any well
[13:43] you know I've got something that I just
[13:45] can't get to you you know I I I've got
[13:48] this secret thing I've never had nothing
[13:50] like that I I've just been always been
[13:53] an open book to tell you what I believe
[13:57] and why I believe it
[13:59] all right and then see that way at least
[14:02] you don't have to wonder what you know
[14:06] I'm trying to bring out you you can say
[14:09] well there one thing for sure we know
[14:11] what he
[14:12] believes you know he he believes in
[14:15] Redemption go we've heard him talk teach
[14:17] it you know he believes in one true and
[14:19] living
[14:20] God and we we followed that you know
[14:23] we've been through that many serieses
[14:26] and this is me this is number 40 to and
[14:29] we'll try to end this evening with we
[14:31] can on this about you know not now the
[14:35] title that we're using but we'll try to
[14:37] get into at least what we've been
[14:40] planning on getting into 40something
[14:42] Services ago all
[14:45] right but I think sometimes it's needful
[14:49] to keep
[14:50] repeating because repetitive things you
[14:53] know are easier to remember than just
[14:57] one label thing I have a very very bad
[15:01] memory for names all right I'm sorry I I
[15:06] have a very bad memory for names I have
[15:09] to be able to relate that over and over
[15:13] and over and over and then when I need
[15:15] it I can't remember it now that's not 75
[15:20] okay that was
[15:22] 21 I've never had an ability to
[15:26] remember you know names and things of
[15:28] people but faces I never forget all
[15:32] right because that's part of your brain
[15:34] working I guess and maybe the rest of
[15:36] mine don't work but you know I I think
[15:40] that the best thing to do is just keep
[15:42] on repeating it they say to remember
[15:45] something you repeat it over you repeat
[15:47] it over over over over over all right so
[15:49] forgive me for repeating myself but
[15:52] remember what we're trying to bring
[15:55] out now we cover and have been for for a
[15:58] long time speaking
[16:00] about the Eternal God now I'm a firm
[16:04] believer there's only one eternal life
[16:07] amen all right and that's God's own life
[16:10] amen all right there's only one Eternal
[16:16] theophany and that is God's own life all
[16:20] right
[16:22] now there is only one Eternal Soul right
[16:28] amen so there's no way to talk about how
[16:30] many they are and what this there's only
[16:33] one Eternal all right and that's God's
[16:36] own life okay now but in the human
[16:40] mortal part see when we fail then by
[16:44] Falling Away then we know
[16:48] that we must be redeemed and that is to
[16:52] be where that we start our redemption in
[16:56] the basis of what we call the new birth
[16:58] bir and bringing it to the point of what
[17:02] is that new birth it's the birth of the
[17:05] word all right the words you hear see
[17:08] then know that will stay with us to be
[17:11] able to tie together throughout the
[17:12] stature of a perfect man throughout
[17:14] anything you want to speak about
[17:16] headstone Etc it will always have to be
[17:20] related to the revealed word all right
[17:24] now so we saw then God was
[17:27] eternal and we covered how there
[17:30] Wednesday night on the basis of him of
[17:34] God being that and that that one
[17:37] theophany is eternal life all right now
[17:41] we had to cover some things because it's
[17:44] necessary of the what and I'll keep
[17:46] repeating this point that there's only
[17:49] one Eternal God there's only one Eternal
[17:52] theophany all right now if you're
[17:55] dealing with anything Eternal then you
[17:58] must must relate that back to being the
[18:00] one doing all right and keeping that in
[18:04] your mind all right then remembering
[18:06] that mankind then the prophet brought
[18:10] out as we covered Wednesday night what
[18:11] did he say he said we bypassed the
[18:15] theophany to come to flesh right all
[18:18] right he said Jesus didn't Bice that
[18:21] that's right he said he become word
[18:24] first he became word
[18:26] form then he cond ascended downward to
[18:30] where that he would be made manifest in
[18:32] human flesh all right and I told you the
[18:35] way that I believe in one true and
[18:37] living God I believe the Bible that that
[18:40] body that we call Jesus was spoken into
[18:43] existence by the word Hebrews 10:5 it
[18:46] was the the prophets that built the body
[18:50] but God had to bring it into
[18:53] manifestation the words that they
[18:55] brought had to be brought together and
[18:58] put into to one man and then it would
[19:01] come out to be John uh 1:14 and the Word
[19:05] was made flesh and dwelt among us all
[19:08] right I believe almighty God dwelt in
[19:10] human flesh I don't believe that he was
[19:12] a first person second person or a third
[19:15] person the prophet said he's not any of
[19:17] those he is the person all right cuz if
[19:20] you got a first person that's a
[19:21] possibility your statement itself means
[19:24] you could have a second one all right so
[19:26] that's the best way that a man could say
[19:29] it don't believe that I believe he is
[19:32] the person of eternal life all right
[19:34] that body sure it had a
[19:38] beginning it was a creation it wasn't
[19:41] created full grown as Adam was and then
[19:45] come into uh being you know it was the
[19:51] fact of it being a baby to where that it
[19:55] could be a Redemptive form all
[19:59] right it would he he he could pay cuz
[20:02] melzer even the best you can do with
[20:05] talking about melch that body was spoken
[20:08] into existence and out of
[20:10] existence and it could not be a redeemer
[20:13] because that wouldn't be kin folks that
[20:15] was just brought in and out as as was
[20:17] needed all right but see then that word
[20:22] form came into flesh all right so then
[20:27] being that then God the word created all
[20:32] things which would be as we read in in
[20:34] James you know we've been over it and 3
[20:36] and N that Jesus Christ created all
[20:39] things so then he was almighty
[20:41] God all right but yet still it's there
[20:44] we got to keep the form of God as our
[20:47] many attributes and things to be able to
[20:50] follow it and not run into the one this
[20:53] thought all right then as we're doing
[20:56] and keeping it correctly the body was a
[20:59] creation I believe that spirit that
[21:03] soul that entered into that body was
[21:06] almighty God Amen now you got your
[21:08] scripture right in him dwelt the
[21:10] fullness of the godhead bodily all right
[21:13] in him uh was God made manifest to where
[21:17] we could be able to see or understand
[21:20] him all right but then we left off at
[21:24] the end because it said he came as
[21:29] Eternal he was the word all right but
[21:32] you and I bypass that then did we byass
[21:36] it is we talking about Wednesday does it
[21:38] mean you bypass something when you try
[21:40] to 285 goes around Atlanta you know and
[21:43] you by pass and go around now that's
[21:46] that's terms that's
[21:48] words it it's simple to me is to just
[21:51] put it in PL language and simple things
[21:54] that we never came that way amen right
[21:59] but we got to put something up and byp
[22:01] pass around it well now where you going
[22:03] to get back to
[22:04] it we were discussing this last night in
[22:07] the Bible study all right and see if you
[22:11] ain't careful then you're going to have
[22:13] too many bodies running around to where
[22:15] that you're you're running into trouble
[22:17] all right but see to byass to me doesn't
[22:20] mean that you got to go around
[22:23] something that it's
[22:26] dire well how do I get connected back to
[22:30] there but it just means simply I never
[22:32] came that
[22:34] way you never came that away nobody came
[22:37] that way except the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:40] because he was almighty God all right so
[22:42] he came down through there condescending
[22:46] you know to where that he would then
[22:48] finally come into
[22:49] flesh all right and that would be to
[22:53] where you would see the one true and the
[22:55] Living God see then that would mean that
[22:57] his spirit as brother brandham said we
[22:59] gave it Wednesday and there is a copy of
[23:01] the quotes to some of you that wasn't
[23:03] here if you don't have it let us know
[23:06] we'll run you off a copy from the quotes
[23:09] Wednesday that I wanted you to keep all
[23:12] right so it's dealing with showing you
[23:17] know Christ being revealed okay all
[23:22] right so we never came word we came
[23:24] human being right amen because of the
[23:27] father
[23:28] amen all right we came into flesh all
[23:32] right then we must return to
[23:35] that but now here is what M
[23:38] basically most people seemingly to me
[23:42] thinks that we come into this world and
[23:44] we come through Redemption and they'll
[23:46] talk about justification sanctification
[23:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[23:50] Redemptive form but then we'll turn
[23:53] around and
[23:56] uh we we look look at something
[24:00] as well I'm trying to find a wording
[24:03] that we're
[24:05] not I believe in Redemption here all
[24:09] right may I say it that way I don't
[24:12] believe we're going to heaven to be
[24:15] redeemed all right now that's kind of
[24:17] like the old style we had one day I hope
[24:20] I'm going I maybe I believe I'm saved
[24:23] but one of these days I'm going to
[24:24] heaven and I'll know I'm saved well you
[24:27] know that's that's not positive
[24:30] thinking Jesus never come up and said
[24:33] well I think I'm God maybe I'm God I
[24:35] hope I'm God I act like him sometimes no
[24:39] no he was almighty God all right I
[24:42] believe Redemption is to bring you and I
[24:46] Body Spirit and soul to the Plan of
[24:51] Redemption all right fulfilling the
[24:54] scriptures all right see then what what
[24:57] do I need something else somewhere
[25:02] else you
[25:04] know well I got something to go to what
[25:07] do you what why can't you realize where
[25:10] you're at now right amen I mean if
[25:13] you're going to e you're going to go
[25:15] from in this world right somebody now I
[25:18] contend I'm one of them you can do what
[25:20] you want too but you know somebody is
[25:22] going to even reach a change of the body
[25:25] right here I believe right
[25:28] that's it's not that we have to wait
[25:30] till we get up there that's right well
[25:32] now if you get to change of the body
[25:34] here and it's eternal
[25:39] life then are you going up to another
[25:42] body
[25:46] no I thought it was to happen here I
[25:50] thought we were to become the word here
[25:52] I thought that's what he was bringing
[25:53] out on who is this
[25:55] mzed that we are to become the word
[25:58] right here amen all right and to do that
[26:01] would be the Plan of Redemption right
[26:04] you
[26:05] know but see if not then we're looking
[26:08] for something else and we're like
[26:10] everybody basically used to be and and a
[26:12] lot of the message people are still that
[26:14] what I'm going to get a new body you
[26:16] know that's still taught in the message
[26:18] ranks after all brother randam has
[26:22] said about that it's not another body
[26:26] it's not that it's this body redeemed
[26:28] after all of that they're still teaching
[26:30] we're going to get a new body
[26:31] right well I don't uh I don't get to
[26:35] that I mean that to me is what this
[26:38] message brought to me amen when I first
[26:42] saw uh or heard this message I heard a
[26:45] man talking about eternal life
[26:50] here we was talking about eternal life
[26:53] there amen and hoping we was going to
[26:56] get there right
[26:58] all right but we're doing is the little
[27:00] girl okay or what
[27:05] is she's she's throwing
[27:07] up she went home she went home okay all
[27:10] right long she's okay all
[27:13] right
[27:15] now see if we don't become the word
[27:18] here what are we going to be here right
[27:22] you know what's the purpose
[27:26] right I I believe in Redemption here
[27:30] amen I believe we're going to be just as
[27:33] Eternal right
[27:35] here as we will be in heaven even the
[27:38] ones who must must go by the grave if
[27:42] I'm one of them and I must go by the
[27:43] grave still while I'm here I'm not
[27:46] coming out of the ground some kind of
[27:48] something and then go up to heaven and I
[27:51] finally find my body somewhere go I did
[27:54] I listened to the man that's in this
[27:56] message that really was talking about
[27:57] that you know that we're going to get a
[27:59] new body and and some way now some way I
[28:02] never did understand it but some way
[28:05] we'd walk out on the ashes on on our own
[28:08] ases in some kind of a body in the
[28:10] Millennium that wouldn't be
[28:13] real you know and we'd be walking on our
[28:17] ises you know but one of these days we'd
[28:19] connect back with
[28:21] that yeah well well why not get it here
[28:25] yeah that's right easier amen
[28:28] you know from my understanding of what I
[28:31] believe I believe we're going to be
[28:33] literal people in the
[28:36] Millennium in glorified
[28:38] bodies these bodies glorified Hallelujah
[28:43] right it's not that we're just going to
[28:45] be there in some theophany
[28:47] form and then one of these days we're
[28:49] going to catch back up with it there's
[28:52] not a lot of redemption to that there's
[28:54] a whole lot of
[28:55] waiting you know
[28:57] trying to get to certain places all
[29:00] right but you see Jesus came word
[29:04] form right right come all the way
[29:08] through as the word then stood on Earth
[29:11] as the word made
[29:12] flesh well I thought that we were to
[29:15] come to that Redemptive form through
[29:18] Jesus Christ until when we meet him in
[29:21] the
[29:22] hour that we'd already be in a glorified
[29:26] body
[29:29] well you know uh I'm just sorry that's
[29:33] it's the way I think at least I tell you
[29:34] what I
[29:35] think all right but now watch then see
[29:39] then we've got a realize reality trying
[29:42] to get down now you got questions write
[29:44] them down this afternoon I mean I don't
[29:46] Bo it don't bother me for you to say
[29:47] brother Dale I don't understand what in
[29:49] the world are you talking
[29:51] about that don't bother me at all it's
[29:54] when you go away and tell everybody else
[29:56] you don't know what I'm talking talking
[29:58] about
[30:00] right and you go home and you talk and
[30:03] you you know you don't you don't let me
[30:04] know at least maybe you maybe I word
[30:07] things wrong maybe I state things wrong
[30:09] I'm just a human
[30:11] being but I at least tell you and I keep
[30:14] repeating to make sure that you don't
[30:16] misunderstand me right right because I
[30:19] know it's easy to do it I know you're
[30:21] sitting there I've seen people I've had
[30:24] people to come and tell me said brother
[30:25] Dale you said so and so and I said I
[30:27] didn't say
[30:28] that yes you
[30:30] did you said so and so son I said I
[30:32] didn't say
[30:35] that well yes you did I said okay we'll
[30:37] just pull the
[30:39] tape we'll play the tape find out where
[30:41] who's right because that's what we got
[30:44] to T for well see most of the time that
[30:48] solves a problem because they figure if
[30:50] you enough to say I'm going to go pull a
[30:53] tape that you're you pretty well know
[30:54] you didn't and if I did say it that way
[30:57] that would with what I
[31:00] meant see it to me I believe right here
[31:06] is where the Redemptive part is
[31:08] amen
[31:10] amen that when we meet him in the air
[31:13] we're going to what our bodies lack un
[31:16] his glorious
[31:18] body all right then we'll live it
[31:20] through the millennial Reign even though
[31:23] the Millennium is not to us the time is
[31:25] not to us it has no meaning to us in the
[31:28] Millennium you know what I mean in time
[31:31] wise because we'll already be
[31:33] Eternal all
[31:37] right but
[31:40] see do we get redemption or do we just
[31:44] make our own ideas our thoughts about
[31:48] things
[31:52] okay we can see how he came
[31:56] forth into being it's what I was doing
[31:59] Wednesday but then we seen that we
[32:02] bypassed the way we should have
[32:05] come right we should have come without
[32:08] sin that's fine but we bypass that
[32:12] that's right and we came to flesh to be
[32:17] tempted all right and then here we
[32:21] receive the word according to who is
[32:23] MDC and then we can go there because we
[32:28] become that word hearer all right
[32:32] now in doing that then what is a human
[32:36] being I spent a lot of time so let's
[32:39] deal a little bit about ourselves and
[32:41] then we'll get to a thought a
[32:44] minute brother Bram says it like this
[32:48] they don't have to pull all of these up
[32:49] until I call for them but on possess the
[32:52] Gate of the enemy brother Brandon says
[32:54] the human
[32:55] being that
[32:57] what has a
[32:59] soul all right so we know that right
[33:03] animal doesn't have a soul right if the
[33:05] animal had a soul then you wouldn't need
[33:07] Jesus Christ because the Redemptive plan
[33:10] would have been made through the animal
[33:12] the animal doesn't have a soul all right
[33:15] it is a body it is a spirit form yes but
[33:18] it does not have a soul to be able to
[33:21] redeem but how real do you think about
[33:24] as I tried to emphasize Wednesday
[33:27] was how real do you think God is now you
[33:30] know that I've preached that for some of
[33:32] you have been around here for 40
[33:34] years and you know that's what I've
[33:36] always tried to get you to believe how
[33:39] real God
[33:40] is Prophet said he's not like the wind
[33:44] right he said if he was you wouldn't
[33:46] have to seek the Holy Ghost cuz it'd be
[33:48] in everything but he's a
[33:52] being but see we we look then we'll get
[33:55] well what form was God in before he
[33:58] became the
[34:02] word I think whatever form he ends up is
[34:05] a form of what he
[34:06] started that's the best I can say it may
[34:09] not be a good way of saying it but every
[34:12] how he started is how he's going to end
[34:14] that's right so whatever he's going to
[34:16] be that way he has to be that way or
[34:19] Hebrews 13:8 is wrong all right so I
[34:24] believe he was real before the world he
[34:26] didn't become Real by his
[34:33] condescending I've tried my best to get
[34:35] you to see that that he didn't come this
[34:37] way and become
[34:40] real he come this way to manifest how
[34:43] real he
[34:45] was right well I just can't see God
[34:49] before the world as being real well why
[34:52] can't you you know why you can't you're
[34:55] still hung in trinitarianism
[35:00] right sorry you're still hung in it
[35:03] because your thoughts is still on that
[35:05] days and hours and things instead of
[35:09] taking the prophet's message and
[35:11] realizing you know who he is and how
[35:14] real he is all right now if you see God
[35:17] is
[35:18] real if you see that God is
[35:22] real and he's not a thought of your
[35:24] imagination he's not something just like
[35:26] a Spirit floating around but he's
[35:30] real and the prophet we gave him
[35:32] Wednesday to you where it said he had a
[35:35] house y he lived in a place called
[35:38] Heaven that's
[35:41] right well what kind of a world was
[35:45] it what kind will it be when it's
[35:51] finished
[35:54] right you can figure out what kind of
[35:56] it'll be why when it's
[35:59] finished the prophet talked about a
[36:01] place
[36:03] called future
[36:05] home and he talked about streets but not
[36:09] that we needed cars and not that kind he
[36:12] talked about the tree of life he talked
[36:14] about the river running through the
[36:16] garden he talked about a
[36:19] world but a beautiful Eternal
[36:24] situation well why can't we believe that
[36:26] that's what it was before we started
[36:29] right amen cuz you see we're making
[36:31] ourselves greater than he
[36:35] is I I keep going over that because I
[36:37] don't want you to I don't want you to
[36:39] lose that thought at least you know that
[36:41] I believe in God being
[36:43] real not just a thought or imagination
[36:46] or or
[36:49] something when we get up to our and
[36:51] we're going to look around there be
[36:53] something floating around well our is a
[36:55] father Our Father how you doing ours the
[36:57] Holy Ghost and
[37:00] our
[37:02] no the Bible says we'll have bodies like
[37:04] under his glorious body so we'll be able
[37:06] to Fellowship throughout eternity
[37:09] am in an eternal
[37:12] body and sister Gail I have never
[37:15] believed that when you get there that
[37:18] you're going to look
[37:20] like somebody
[37:24] else you're going to look like you
[37:27] why can't we believe
[37:29] that why can't we believe that this is
[37:31] the body that we'll live in but made
[37:35] Eternal take away the scars take away
[37:38] the pimples take away the the things
[37:43] you take away the
[37:46] lines you know the age things the
[37:49] chicken tracks take away all of that the
[37:52] fat
[37:54] blubber hey I got one to right ra her
[37:57] hand take away all of that and bring us
[38:01] to a beautiful perfect
[38:04] State and that we'll live like that
[38:07] through eternity
[38:09] amen
[38:12] well you'll see that I really do believe
[38:14] in
[38:15] Redemption all
[38:17] right but the prophet of God said you
[38:21] are a
[38:23] soul that's what you are right mhm
[38:28] a soul a being a
[38:34] person that if death strikes
[38:39] us the body goes to the
[38:43] Grave the spirit goes back to God who
[38:45] gave
[38:47] it the soul goes beyond the curtain of
[38:54] time why can't we believe that
[38:58] and see brother Dale don't understand
[39:00] everything brother Luis brought up a
[39:03] question last night in the Bible study
[39:06] about that Spirit going back to God who
[39:09] gave believe it was him somebody brought
[39:11] it
[39:12] up and you know
[39:14] what I caught
[39:18] something while everybody was discussing
[39:21] that that helped me to understand
[39:24] because I've always wondered about that
[39:25] myself
[39:28] brother dick and I've always talked
[39:30] about that the spirit goes back to God
[39:32] who gave it but I've always told him and
[39:34] always have believe you can't take
[39:36] something sinful back to
[39:38] God
[39:41] right you can't do
[39:44] that but I it really struck me and maybe
[39:48] this is you
[39:51] know when that baby is born that spirit
[39:54] that comes into that body that baby is
[39:57] born is perfect right not not Eternal
[40:00] not Eternal let don't go okay perfect
[40:03] perfect why because God can't create
[40:05] anything
[40:06] imperfect the baby learns to be
[40:09] imperfect you know it learns to lie it
[40:12] learns to do right but it's created
[40:16] Perfect all
[40:18] right I step out of this body there's a
[40:21] lot of problems in my memory my reason
[40:24] my conscience my spirit being that I am
[40:28] inside of there with a spirit we call
[40:30] it now we're not going to I've always
[40:33] believed that you can't take that sinful
[40:35] back into the presence of God nowhere
[40:38] can it stand in the presence of
[40:42] God so then
[40:45] evidently when I leave this earth and my
[40:48] spirit goes back to God who gave it All
[40:51] of Me ain't me Spirit ain't
[40:54] going CU me spirit is bad stuff all of
[40:59] that going to be wiped away but the
[41:01] spirit that is perfect that I started
[41:03] with can go back to God to wait a
[41:06] time that it can come back to reite you
[41:10] reunite with the body and I said okay I
[41:13] I got some thinking now I at least think
[41:16] on that but maybe you don't understand
[41:18] my terminologies the things that are
[41:20] wrong in me can't go in the presence of
[41:25] God
[41:26] and I have wrong memories wrong
[41:29] Consciousness but the Bible says the
[41:31] former things is what passed
[41:35] away so when a person dies the former
[41:38] things of his spirit will never be able
[41:40] to go into the presence of God in the
[41:43] form of the wrong
[41:45] Parts but the perfect part can go there
[41:49] no problem now with that I can see that
[41:51] so I got some help myself questions and
[41:54] answers help me it ain't brother Dale
[41:56] knowing
[41:58] everything I'm learning too you know and
[42:01] ever learning in the word of God all
[42:04] right but get back to the
[42:07] reality see we look at the body as
[42:09] thinking it's
[42:11] real because we can feel it we can do
[42:14] with it see you know we look at the
[42:15] spirit because it has the memories the
[42:17] reason the Consciousness and we we make
[42:20] that real but just
[42:23] remember the soul is more real than
[42:25] either one of those too
[42:29] right but see we want to we want to
[42:31] bring it just like well the soul is just
[42:32] a nature of the spirit no it's not just
[42:34] the nature of the spirit I want one
[42:36] quote where it's just the nature of the
[42:39] spirit I can give you plenty where he
[42:41] says it's the nature of the spirit but
[42:42] you can't take you don't bring that to
[42:44] it's just the nature of the
[42:46] spirit because you're just making it
[42:48] like a dog it's a bird dog and there
[42:50] another was a hound dog and this over
[42:51] here is this dog this over here that dog
[42:53] you're just making it like a
[42:54] dog no
[42:58] the soul of
[43:00] man is
[43:02] real the Bible says a soul that sinth it
[43:05] shall die right right so matter no
[43:09] matter whether we're a sinner or a
[43:12] saint we have a soul that makes the
[43:15] difference between us and the
[43:17] Animals we are a being a person all
[43:22] right and in doing that then brother
[43:25] Bram says you are what you are on the
[43:28] message uncertain s you are what you are
[43:32] by your
[43:35] soul all right you remember what I gave
[43:39] the other day on it it's in one of these
[43:41] quotes where brother brandom is
[43:43] explaining the lie
[43:48] detector and the lie detector comes out
[43:50] from that inside let's see if I can find
[43:52] that I'll talk long enough to find
[43:54] something but I'll do it let's
[43:57] see uh because really what I like is
[44:00] this I like on the message uncertain
[44:02] sound where he says it like this but
[44:04] down on the inside of you in the
[44:08] subconscious lays a place called the
[44:15] soul in the
[44:18] subconscious your soul is what governs
[44:20] you you are what you are by your soul I
[44:25] believe that all right
[44:29] y see nothing has a soul but
[44:36] man Man was created in the image of God
[44:43] y now that was not
[44:45] body right cuz that's the image of the
[44:48] animal that was not
[44:51] Spirit but it was the soul of
[44:54] man
[44:56] all right created in the image of
[44:59] God so when Jesus Christ came
[45:03] back on the day of Pentecost according
[45:06] to the message called the token
[45:07] paragraph
[45:11] 31 not only did the soul of a man come
[45:15] or a spirit of a man but God
[45:23] himself and he goes on into the Israel
[45:26] in the church and he says he sent back
[45:29] his soul in the form of the baptism of
[45:33] the Holy Ghost I believe that all right
[45:36] see then that push us into that
[45:39] place
[45:41] Amen to where the soul is the real
[45:45] you all right it's not just some
[45:49] thoughts right or ideas it's the real
[45:54] you
[45:56] but now there goost to where or not did
[45:59] you believe now I'm going I'm putting it
[46:01] right back on the message
[46:03] what if you believe that your soul is
[46:06] not real then you don't believe God is
[46:13] real all right I'll let you think about
[46:15] that a little
[46:16] bit if you don't think the soul of
[46:18] mankind is more real than the body and
[46:20] spirit that you see standing before you
[46:23] and talking to you the you don't believe
[46:26] that God is
[46:31] real but but I just can't understand do
[46:33] you mean there's something standing
[46:35] inside of
[46:37] me no it's what's standing in front of
[46:44] you death
[46:46] takes this being that I
[46:49] am and brings it into
[46:53] reality is the soul
[46:57] but I just never have believed your soul
[46:59] why can't you believe that your soul is
[47:01] real right
[47:03] amen
[47:04] amen animals don't know right and
[47:07] wrong
[47:09] right what makes a difference is you is
[47:12] the soul that that's doing it all right
[47:15] now that makes you to
[47:18] understand I'll find that in a minute if
[47:21] you don't I'll get it to you
[47:22] later of where he was talking about the
[47:26] lie detector's test see that lie
[47:29] detector's test is working off of that
[47:31] soul that you
[47:33] are right but see we we we don't want to
[47:38] think
[47:40] about us as being real why
[47:46] not come on if man is created in the
[47:49] image of
[47:50] God is God not real amen right amen well
[47:55] well if God is just a floating Spirit
[47:58] just rolling along this then man is a
[48:00] floating Spirit rolling
[48:05] along and brother randam taught it as
[48:07] what as we read there in
[48:09] Genesis that there was a spiritual Man
[48:12] created in the image of
[48:16] God and then there was a physical Man
[48:19] created in the image of the animal and
[48:22] the spiritual man was placed into the
[48:25] natural man and he breathed into the ad
[48:28] into nostrils of Adam and he became an
[48:31] eternal
[48:37] person is that Blasphemous
[48:41] names well see then it's it's
[48:44] real but the part we
[48:47] bypassed was that part that's
[48:54] Eternal we didn't come come that
[48:57] way it wasn't it was we was eternal and
[49:00] we bypassed it and then become
[49:02] Eternal
[49:04] no we just didn't become Eternal Adam
[49:07] did Adam and Eve were the only one you
[49:10] shorten the prophet's message you show
[49:12] me where anybody else comes with eternal
[49:14] life because God breathes into their
[49:20] nostrils as a living
[49:22] Soul see we would have never known
[49:24] nothing about ad had the prophet not
[49:26] come with
[49:31] that we would have thought about Adam
[49:33] just being like the rest of
[49:38] us no his soul was eternal why because
[49:42] Genesis 1 went into Genesis 2
[49:47] right all right now as I started off
[49:50] with a statement there's just one
[49:52] eternal life amen there's just one
[49:55] Eternal
[49:56] theophany there's just one Eternal
[50:00] Soul all right so God has to deal with
[50:04] you and I and see that's where we bypass
[50:07] that part of what it should have
[50:10] been
[50:14] okay I turn back and find
[50:19] it I want you to pay attention this is a
[50:22] message y UNC sign you can go ahead and
[50:24] pull up number four if you want
[50:28] you put a li DET tecture on you and you
[50:30] try to impersonate that that truth and
[50:33] try to say that it's truth but down on
[50:36] the inside of you in the subconscious
[50:38] lays a place called the soul and this
[50:42] intellectual
[50:44] mind does not govern that vibration of
[50:49] the
[50:52] system right and this intellectual mind
[50:56] does not govern that vibration of the
[50:59] system the mind is only a director it
[51:03] will direct you and it's very capable of
[51:05] bringing you to God right your mind you
[51:09] cannot know God by your mind
[51:12] intellectual it's one of the resources
[51:15] or the channels that would lead you to
[51:18] it but your soul is what governs you you
[51:21] are what you are by your soul see the L
[51:24] detector doesn't work off your spirit
[51:26] cuz like I told you you can take a pen
[51:29] and they can ask you a question and you
[51:31] take a pen and stick it into your body
[51:33] the machine's going to
[51:35] record a
[51:37] reaction
[51:40] right but if they hold you there and
[51:42] don't let you do none of that you can't
[51:45] lie from the soul it's the soul of man
[51:48] that can't lie the spirit and the body
[51:50] lies all the time always has been but
[51:54] the soul can't lie
[51:55] cuz that's the real
[51:57] you but that seems to be the hardest
[51:59] thing maybe for me to comprehend
[52:03] okay if we think about well brother Dale
[52:06] I see your body I see your AC I do
[52:09] where's your soul that's what I
[52:15] am that's what I am amen right death
[52:20] puts me in another position right that
[52:24] the soul can become come
[52:27] into capable of being seen as we'd call
[52:30] it or
[52:31] whatever cuz what about the man on the
[52:33] road that the prophet spoke
[52:36] of the old man in the Overcoat what
[52:38] about
[52:40] him he was real enough to make the car
[52:43] lunge he was real enough for everybody
[52:45] to see
[52:47] him you know for some to see him what
[52:50] about
[52:52] it he wasn't in his physical body
[52:56] right but we don't want to think about
[52:58] something like that being real you know
[53:01] the reason we don't want to think about
[53:02] real we don't want to deal with
[53:07] it we don't want to deal with
[53:11] ourselves
[53:12] amen we wanted to stay out in the body
[53:15] realm the spirit realm and deceive
[53:17] everybody come to church be good do all
[53:20] the things we was in that last night in
[53:23] the Book of Romans right
[53:29] but the soul is the real you
[53:32] right and no matter am I quoting the
[53:35] prophet no matter whether it's sinner or
[53:38] Saint it's in the image of God come
[53:43] on it's a Supernatural
[53:46] part of a
[53:50] being whether it's sinner or Saint right
[53:53] a sinner has a a old as well
[53:57] as and that's what I've tried for all of
[54:00] these years to
[54:03] explain why brother Brandon would come
[54:05] on and say it's page 80 of the old
[54:07] Hebrew Book it's paragraph 279 of
[54:12] the that he would say that that man
[54:16] let's get down to that part because if
[54:18] you're not going to get it we're not
[54:19] going to worry about it so let's go to
[54:21] number
[54:24] 10 remember what I'm saying now he sent
[54:27] back his soul in the form of the baptism
[54:30] of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[54:33] Pentecost now let me Express something
[54:35] right there that we think of as I said
[54:38] the other day that we think that this
[54:40] when brother Brown said it's you and God
[54:42] together as
[54:45] persons well is he inside of here or
[54:48] standing beside of
[54:50] here or where's he
[54:54] at
[54:56] as I said if we
[54:58] bypassed something what was it eternal
[55:03] life right we bypassed eternal
[55:08] life we bypassed coming like Adam did
[55:11] that's right all right see then is it
[55:15] two people standing or does God
[55:18] simply come down and bring his nature
[55:23] into you of eternal
[55:28] life see that way you can see the old
[55:30] nature can
[55:32] die and brother Brown will call it the
[55:35] soul that's
[55:37] fine but remember he's not dealing with
[55:40] taking you out and putting God in that's
[55:43] right I've always tried to explain that
[55:46] to you Adam was
[55:49] Adam we'll get down in a minute we get
[55:52] time we don't we C it this evening
[55:55] brother BR said Eve was in Adam and
[56:00] theophany I see
[56:05] that they only had one theophany
[56:09] right I see that and there's only one
[56:12] soul but now watch Eve had a soul and
[56:15] Adam had a
[56:16] soul that's human being
[56:21] Parts but there's only one theophany
[56:24] there's only one Eternal theophany
[56:26] there's only one Eternal
[56:28] Soul all right so watch what he's saying
[56:31] now and when man be come into that body
[56:34] he had control of the fishes now who's
[56:36] he talking about we ain't never had
[56:38] control of the fishes we ain't never had
[56:40] a control of the Beast they're under our
[56:43] subjection but no they're not we're
[56:46] that's his Adam
[56:49] right that's the way we should have come
[56:52] right and if we' have come that way with
[56:55] no sin that would have been us right but
[56:58] we didn't come that way we bypassed so
[57:01] watch what he say and then there was no
[57:03] man to the saw
[57:04] him see he done made male and female
[57:08] well Adam and Eve but there's no man to
[57:11] till the soil then God made Man Out of
[57:14] the Dust of the earth and rolled it on
[57:15] up he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee
[57:17] he's like a dog he's a material like a
[57:19] horse but the difference between an
[57:21] animal and a man God put a soul in a man
[57:25] he didn't put it in the animal because
[57:28] the soul that was in the man is that
[57:32] theophany all right now if there's only
[57:34] one one
[57:37] theophan we're talking about eternal
[57:39] life theop that's right every human
[57:41] being has a soul right every human being
[57:46] is a soul better to say than has a soul
[57:49] has a soul is a different terminology he
[57:52] is a soul he is a being he's a person
[57:55] all right and he has a body to go to
[57:58] when he
[57:59] dies whether it be heaven or whether it
[58:02] be hell he's going somewhere who's going
[58:06] he's not his body in the grave rotten in
[58:10] the way not his
[58:12] Spirit he got to move out go somewhere
[58:15] cuz you can't take that wrong Spirit to
[58:19] God his soul that's it will live on
[58:23] somewhere that's right whether he's a
[58:25] Christian or not right amen your soul is
[58:30] the real you and you're going to stand
[58:32] there one day in that Soul amen and be
[58:36] judged God can bring back the
[58:39] body and let you stand there that's fine
[58:42] but the soul that sinth it shall die you
[58:45] ain't concerned with the body all right
[58:48] cuz watch now in
[58:52] Adam brother R I said is explaining Adam
[58:55] Adam in the Hebrew Book he ain't
[58:58] explaining all of us he's explaining
[59:00] Adam right just like he is on
[59:03] Blasphemous names when he's explaining
[59:06] that God breathed into Adam eternal life
[59:10] amen he didn't breathe into you and me
[59:13] eternal life when we was born that's
[59:16] right but he breathed into Adam eternal
[59:19] life but he didn't breathe into the rest
[59:23] all right but think about
[59:26] it now think with me a little bit and
[59:29] just consider the thought you know
[59:32] consider what I've tried to explain for
[59:34] almost 50
[59:37] years not seeing it all as I see it now
[59:40] I agree I'm no problem I'm still
[59:45] learning all
[59:47] right but you see if a person dies
[59:50] they're going
[59:52] somewhere it's just not Spirits floating
[59:54] around around there's a place to go to
[59:57] that's right you can deal with show
[59:59] goana Hades in in calling hell because
[1:00:03] it's really not the word hell is not
[1:00:05] there it's it's dealing with a place to
[1:00:09] go and brother random says it's like a
[1:00:14] falling the center dead is The Fifth
[1:00:18] Dimension the
[1:00:20] Christian in whatever form they're in is
[1:00:22] a sixth Dimension and don't ask ask me
[1:00:24] to explain that because I can't if I'd
[1:00:27] have been God I would have said that the
[1:00:29] Fifth Dimension is five in number of
[1:00:31] Grace and good and that would be the
[1:00:33] good people and six would be the bad
[1:00:37] people cuz the number of man is six but
[1:00:39] I'm not God so I didn't get to say it
[1:00:42] right that's good all right he's the one
[1:00:45] that said it through the prophet well
[1:00:48] there's a reason for all that being that
[1:00:49] way because it's got to be in those
[1:00:51] dimensional things amen it's just like
[1:00:53] Jesus was in the seventh Dimension right
[1:00:57] brother Brandon said I want to go there
[1:00:58] he said you can't go there
[1:01:01] right you couldn't go on into the
[1:01:03] seventh Dimension to where God
[1:01:06] was he had to deal in the sixth
[1:01:08] Dimension sold under the altar all right
[1:01:12] but do you
[1:01:15] understand a sinner has a body to go to
[1:01:18] it can be called it's
[1:01:22] theop a Christian has a body to go to it
[1:01:25] can be called your theophany right one
[1:01:28] of them's Eternal and one of them's
[1:01:30] not one of them has a downward current
[1:01:33] is that the way we brought it the
[1:01:34] prophet said the other one has an upward
[1:01:36] current all right when we're born into
[1:01:38] the natural world we're born going
[1:01:40] downward that's right right everybody
[1:01:44] priest king don't matter Prophet priest
[1:01:47] king whoever it is except Jesus Christ
[1:01:50] is born with a downward current all
[1:01:53] right but then when you're born again
[1:01:56] you turn and start upwardly that's right
[1:01:59] now as we gave from who is this m
[1:02:02] brother randam says when you're formed
[1:02:04] into that word part he said you heard
[1:02:06] from you theophany come
[1:02:08] on because why because right here at
[1:02:12] Faith as you're born again you heard
[1:02:14] from this love up
[1:02:17] here that's what's drawing
[1:02:20] us that's the positive of God's mind
[1:02:23] that's drawing us upward I believe in
[1:02:25] every bit of
[1:02:27] that I believe the soul is not complete
[1:02:30] as a prop he say he only got the earnest
[1:02:32] right that's right
[1:02:35] right the positive is drawing us when
[1:02:38] this when this grows up into this
[1:02:43] position and The Headstone United then
[1:02:47] somebody's going out of
[1:02:48] here am all
[1:02:51] right but do you understand what I've
[1:02:54] tried to bring to you cuz it's what I've
[1:02:55] tried to whether you agree with me or
[1:02:57] not that's up to you you're going to
[1:02:59] have to pray to God to let him talk to
[1:03:01] you all
[1:03:05] right I know that's not a popular
[1:03:08] thought to think about your soul being
[1:03:10] your theophany but why
[1:03:16] not well I've always believed I got one
[1:03:18] up there all right now let me illustrate
[1:03:22] it you're born again right here right
[1:03:24] right you know that's what's pulling you
[1:03:27] right where's it
[1:03:29] at it's pulling
[1:03:32] you what's the
[1:03:34] problem I'm connected to
[1:03:37] it I heard from The Headstone when I
[1:03:41] received the new birth
[1:03:43] right and I've taught you what I believe
[1:03:45] now F I believe it I believe this
[1:03:48] message is The Headstone to the body of
[1:03:51] Christ because that was the thing that
[1:03:54] was not
[1:03:57] brought when brother R said The
[1:03:58] Headstone ain't come yet I said wait
[1:04:01] just a minute now you mean you got all
[1:04:03] of this and all of that but then it
[1:04:05] struck me one day his
[1:04:09] message caps off everything if not you
[1:04:12] better look for something else to come
[1:04:14] to bring you another
[1:04:15] message right that's right I'm not
[1:04:18] looking for something else to come I'm
[1:04:20] looking at this message to be revealed
[1:04:22] to you and I to be made manifest amen
[1:04:26] why can't we we'll get into Masterpiece
[1:04:28] one day and brother Ram even says it
[1:04:30] like this where he says that Mary
[1:04:32] represented of zeusa street he said
[1:04:35] because she was a
[1:04:37] carrier of the
[1:04:39] word but somebody's not going to be a
[1:04:42] carrier come
[1:04:44] on that's got to happen to you and I all
[1:04:47] right but
[1:04:52] listen then
[1:04:54] to a
[1:04:56] sinner he has a place to go to when he
[1:05:02] dies it's not
[1:05:05] D it's waiting for him to die it's
[1:05:09] pulling him
[1:05:12] yeah it's drawing him right the best we
[1:05:16] think we are don't worry about it an
[1:05:20] unregenerated person has got a downward
[1:05:22] pull I don't care what you want to call
[1:05:24] it
[1:05:25] upwards you got it all messed up it's
[1:05:28] it's pulling somewhere else all right
[1:05:31] but when you're born
[1:05:33] again and see we got to be born again to
[1:05:36] be in the body of Christ right then that
[1:05:38] starts an upward pull from Faith virtue
[1:05:42] knowledge Temperance patience call
[1:05:43] starts pulling us
[1:05:46] upward are being born again as Peter
[1:05:49] would call it right by the what
[1:05:52] Incorruptible word of God
[1:05:55] go cuz that's what I asked brother Mo
[1:05:57] when he taught that 19 in 71 right into
[1:06:01] 72 he taught the statue of perfect man
[1:06:04] and it was wonderful to understand those
[1:06:06] things but I asked him one question I
[1:06:08] said how do I get those
[1:06:11] virt and it never was revealed to me
[1:06:15] until about
[1:06:18] 1980 right in there when I preached the
[1:06:20] seals the first time and I began to see
[1:06:22] some things of prophet was
[1:06:25] saying and as I begin to see those
[1:06:27] things I realize what the Bible was
[1:06:29] saying that you're being born again by
[1:06:32] The Incorruptible word of God how do you
[1:06:35] get virtue well I just I just need
[1:06:37] virtue so I'll just be
[1:06:39] good brother said that's not a virgin
[1:06:42] life
[1:06:43] virtues he said it means
[1:06:46] power what's going to bring you the
[1:06:48] power the Bible says what you shall
[1:06:51] receive power you shall receive virtue
[1:06:53] after the the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:06:55] you
[1:06:57] amen right see the opening of the word
[1:07:01] will bring the vires into
[1:07:03] being I don't believe the seventh under
[1:07:06] virture message part now because to them
[1:07:09] really they were saying uh I'll tell you
[1:07:12] when you're going to get it and I'll
[1:07:14] tell you whether you got it or not well
[1:07:16] I ain't never told none of you whether
[1:07:18] you got it or not and I've always told
[1:07:20] you the Lord ain't told me where I'm at
[1:07:25] the only thing the Lord ever spoke to me
[1:07:27] about the statute of perfect man he said
[1:07:29] if you'll have patience with the people
[1:07:30] said it'll prove you got patience now
[1:07:33] that's all the statement I can tell you
[1:07:35] he ain't never told me you're here
[1:07:37] you're there you're doing no he just
[1:07:40] simply made the statement if you'll have
[1:07:43] patience with the people then it'll
[1:07:44] prove you got patience well I thought
[1:07:46] that's all right I'll stay right there
[1:07:48] and if that's as far as I go I ain't
[1:07:50] worried about
[1:07:52] it I talking to brother Howard Carl the
[1:07:55] other day and reminded him of what I'd
[1:07:57] heard he said he said one way or the
[1:07:59] other I'm going somewhere pretty quick
[1:08:01] cuz he's he's 80 I think maybe even a
[1:08:03] little over 80 well we're going
[1:08:04] somewhere pretty quick one way or the
[1:08:07] other either by the grave or by change
[1:08:10] that's right right cuz we ain't going to
[1:08:13] stay around here too much longer like I
[1:08:15] told you if it keeps on going where it's
[1:08:17] going we're going to be having services
[1:08:19] in the nursing
[1:08:21] home right
[1:08:24] because that's where we're going to be
[1:08:27] but listen church do you see what I'm
[1:08:29] talking
[1:08:31] about when a person is created brought
[1:08:35] into being I tried to explain this I
[1:08:38] believe now as that baby begins to
[1:08:41] develop we know that it doesn't record
[1:08:44] anything until the age of accountability
[1:08:46] right God doesn't count all of that but
[1:08:48] that but when that age of accountability
[1:08:51] comes into being whatever it is and it
[1:08:53] could be a difference from everybody so
[1:08:55] we ain't worried about
[1:08:56] it but when it does you become to know
[1:08:59] the difference in right and
[1:09:01] wrong and you know what then your nature
[1:09:04] is being molded your soul is being
[1:09:07] built I believe that it took 75 years to
[1:09:11] build me what I
[1:09:15] am I believe
[1:09:19] that all right 1969 I tell tell you and
[1:09:24] I believe that was the year of my new
[1:09:27] birth after I'd been in the message for
[1:09:29] 2 or 3
[1:09:32] years all right don't count all of the
[1:09:35] things that's happened as my new birth I
[1:09:37] count the birth of the word all
[1:09:40] right when everybody else was going
[1:09:43] haywire in 1976 going into
[1:09:46] 1977 you know where I
[1:09:50] stood and that I stood right here and
[1:09:52] said you get away from the dates and the
[1:09:55] times and the
[1:09:58] seasons in 1974 I preached we could go
[1:10:01] past the year
[1:10:03] 2026 nobody wants to know how come I
[1:10:06] believe that or why I put that number on
[1:10:10] it but you know what we're gaining on
[1:10:14] it
[1:10:15] right 11 years I might not be able to
[1:10:18] make it to that place but hey it's
[1:10:19] pretty close this is
[1:10:22] 2015
[1:10:24] but you know what everybody else was
[1:10:25] saying you know what I'm
[1:10:26] saying right that everybody was saying
[1:10:30] we're going to be out of here in 77 I
[1:10:32] said you're messing up the prophet's
[1:10:35] message I said you're making statements
[1:10:37] that he didn't make he said don't you
[1:10:40] say that the 77 I'm going out of here
[1:10:43] right you know what he wanted it way
[1:10:46] before then right I did
[1:10:50] too but I knew what it could go to and
[1:10:53] I'm still know what it can go
[1:10:54] to it can go a long time cuz see I've
[1:10:58] upgraded from that 2026 to say now we
[1:11:01] can go to the year of
[1:11:04] 4,000 and not break the
[1:11:07] message 5,000
[1:11:10] 10,000 I sure don't want to cuz I know
[1:11:14] for certainty you and I ain't going to
[1:11:16] be around
[1:11:18] here but that's the
[1:11:20] Bible cuz once you entered 1977 instead
[1:11:24] of it being where everybody started
[1:11:25] sending their books back that was the
[1:11:27] year it began to open to
[1:11:32] me to say here is where it's
[1:11:35] at it's not a year it's
[1:11:42] Christ all
[1:11:45] right see did I begin to preach about
[1:11:48] God being
[1:11:52] real and I begin to try to bring things
[1:11:55] into to our understanding that we could
[1:11:57] comprehend better than to just well
[1:12:00] we're waiting on a bus to pull up uh you
[1:12:03] know something's going to
[1:12:04] happen I begin to preach that if it was
[1:12:08] you know what I preached you know if you
[1:12:10] believe a bus is going to pull up and
[1:12:12] get you one day you know what somebody's
[1:12:14] going to have to produce a
[1:12:17] bus do you understand what I mean by
[1:12:20] that
[1:12:22] right if you're believing a bus has got
[1:12:25] to pull up somebody's got to make a
[1:12:29] bus that was the one that got me when
[1:12:32] that brother was was telling me you know
[1:12:33] that that they create that had that
[1:12:36] airplane waiting on brother Brown to
[1:12:37] come back I'm not throwing off on him
[1:12:40] I'm throwing off on his
[1:12:42] statement cuz he said we got the
[1:12:44] airplane we said it' take two years to
[1:12:47] get that airplane
[1:12:50] flyable you didn't think about what he
[1:12:52] say he saying the Lord couldn't come for
[1:12:54] two years cuz in our airplane ready now
[1:12:57] ain't that
[1:13:00] something you know where I stand I've
[1:13:03] made myself plain we're going to have 30
[1:13:05] 40 days after the resurrection I ain't
[1:13:08] got no
[1:13:09] problems I just got problems with your
[1:13:11] ideas and my ideas that won't tie with
[1:13:14] the rest of the word of God
[1:13:18] right that's right we this to me is
[1:13:21] creating the bus if you want call it
[1:13:24] that he's trying to bring the bus into
[1:13:26] being is our understanding of the word
[1:13:28] of God is going to have to bring things
[1:13:30] to a
[1:13:34] place that God can move on the scene
[1:13:37] that's right if not what are we doing
[1:13:40] here why not eat drink and be married
[1:13:43] forget it cuz it won't be long we all
[1:13:44] get out of
[1:13:48] here why not just put it like he's
[1:13:50] saying
[1:13:51] it like I said then to Adam God breathed
[1:13:56] into his nostrils the breath of eternal
[1:13:58] life his own life into
[1:14:02] Adam he put in Adam the
[1:14:06] soul I believe
[1:14:09] that that would come
[1:14:11] forth which would be his
[1:14:17] theophany all right then there's only
[1:14:19] one Eternal theophany so Genesis 1:26
[1:14:22] and 27 is talking about a multiple
[1:14:25] form of that one person which is Jesus
[1:14:29] Christ believe that all
[1:14:33] right and our soul is now at the Y but
[1:14:36] you say let's go to that but we we're
[1:14:38] not going to get through let's go to
[1:14:39] that go ahead brother and pull up uh I
[1:14:42] got it in here but pull up second
[1:14:45] Corinthians pull up 2 Corinthians 5 if
[1:14:48] you want to get into your Bible and read
[1:14:49] it we can do it but we'll read it off
[1:14:51] the screen what does it say about this
[1:14:54] people call the theophany the
[1:14:58] things put up 2 Corinthians
[1:15:01] 5 for we know that so that's the ones on
[1:15:04] the computer they can pull it up in a
[1:15:05] hurry now watch what he says for we know
[1:15:09] that if our Earthly House of this
[1:15:12] Tabernacle were dissolved that's not
[1:15:14] your house you own at home that's not
[1:15:17] where you rent an
[1:15:19] apartment
[1:15:21] okay that
[1:15:25] you that's a body that's a human parts
[1:15:29] and things
[1:15:31] right we have a building of God and
[1:15:34] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[1:15:42] heavens so the prophets right that
[1:15:44] before the foundation of the world and
[1:15:45] the Bible's right that the Morning Star
[1:15:47] saying together and the sons of God
[1:15:49] shattered for Joy but what they explain
[1:15:51] that his being
[1:15:56] he said that was in the mind of God
[1:15:58] right right amen right come on
[1:16:03] now for in
[1:16:06] this we grown earnestly Desiring to be
[1:16:09] clothed upon with our house which is
[1:16:11] from
[1:16:12] Heaven if so be that being clothed we
[1:16:15] shall not be found naked all right but
[1:16:19] in this Tabernacle we do groan being
[1:16:22] burdened
[1:16:23] m not for that we would be unclothed but
[1:16:27] clothed upon that mortal might be
[1:16:29] swallowed up of life right roll it back
[1:16:32] down to verse one and let's read
[1:16:36] it okay for we know if
[1:16:41] question our Earthly House of this
[1:16:44] Tabernacle
[1:16:50] were
[1:16:52] dissolved
[1:16:54] we have a building of God and house not
[1:16:57] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[1:17:00] now that can't be talking to the sinner
[1:17:02] right so we're we're going to exclude
[1:17:05] him because the Bible is not written to
[1:17:08] The
[1:17:09] Sinner it is written only to the
[1:17:12] Christian to the
[1:17:15] Saints it's not written to The Sinner
[1:17:17] it's written to the Saints so
[1:17:21] what the Saints the Born Again
[1:17:25] Believers if our Earthly House of this
[1:17:29] Tabernacle were
[1:17:34] dissolved bringing it bringing it to a
[1:17:36] present tense form if it were
[1:17:40] dissolved we have one
[1:17:42] waiting is it
[1:17:45] waiting or is it there the second we
[1:17:48] step over there right which one is
[1:17:52] it
[1:17:55] in God's mind it's waiting right in
[1:17:57] God's mind everybody that will ever
[1:17:59] receive the headstone in his mind has
[1:18:02] already got it
[1:18:04] right true
[1:18:06] right but that don't mean we've got
[1:18:10] it what did we give you and ask you to
[1:18:12] read where brother brand talking about
[1:18:14] on Hood this meled where he says we have
[1:18:16] not yet the
[1:18:21] bodies
[1:18:23] well see we want something up
[1:18:25] there because we we're we're we're
[1:18:28] satisfied with that God can do something
[1:18:30] up there but we're not satisfied with
[1:18:32] what he's doing
[1:18:36] here I thought this was the most
[1:18:39] important
[1:18:44] part I thought you were supposed to have
[1:18:47] read and who is this Mel chedic that if
[1:18:49] you wasn't the word to start with you
[1:18:53] would never be the
[1:18:55] word you remember that
[1:19:00] statement if you wasn't the word to
[1:19:02] start with see that way I believe that
[1:19:06] all born again
[1:19:08] Believers had eternal life before the
[1:19:10] world ever
[1:19:12] begun in God's
[1:19:14] mind but not in
[1:19:19] reality but in God's
[1:19:21] mind
[1:19:24] so then my soul is my theophany as it
[1:19:27] says about Adam because see I'm born
[1:19:29] again now if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:19:32] dissolved I just step right
[1:19:34] over believe is it there waiting on
[1:19:40] me now I'll express it this way and I'll
[1:19:43] stop and we'll have the questions and
[1:19:45] answers this evening because that's what
[1:19:46] we were talking about last
[1:19:49] night if we
[1:19:51] believe
[1:19:53] in justification sanctification the
[1:19:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe
[1:19:58] that justification is the work of the
[1:19:59] Holy Ghost sanctification is the work of
[1:20:01] the Holy Ghost but the baptism is the
[1:20:02] Holy Ghost and that's where eternal life
[1:20:05] comes into
[1:20:07] being right so you have eternal life in
[1:20:12] your soul by the new
[1:20:14] birth right
[1:20:17] right well then we just read that that
[1:20:19] body that a lot of people wants is
[1:20:21] eternal in the heavens right
[1:20:23] I thought there was only one form of
[1:20:25] eternal
[1:20:26] life think about
[1:20:28] that I didn't think there was four parts
[1:20:31] of this thing now there's four in
[1:20:34] restoration don't misunderstand
[1:20:36] me but there's three stages to
[1:20:40] life justification sanctification the
[1:20:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes that
[1:20:45] Soul Eternal amen all
[1:20:49] right they don't make the body and the
[1:20:51] spirit eternal right it makes the soul
[1:20:55] Eternal all right and we're being born
[1:20:59] again by The Incorruptible word as we
[1:21:01] hear it and it's revealed to us we're
[1:21:03] gaining upward
[1:21:04] ground coming more into the
[1:21:07] positive of what we should
[1:21:11] be but you
[1:21:14] see no matter what you say or how many
[1:21:17] times you say it people are still going
[1:21:19] to hold on to their thoughts that they
[1:21:21] had right
[1:21:24] well I've got a body up you waiting on
[1:21:26] me and how is it in the message they do
[1:21:30] right they sing a song about my
[1:21:33] theophany being up somewhere else and
[1:21:36] you're going to take a song over the
[1:21:38] word of
[1:21:39] God and I have no problem with the song
[1:21:42] right it's a beautiful
[1:21:47] song but you see the day you was born
[1:21:49] again you heard from the positive of
[1:21:53] God's mind of what you will be in this
[1:21:56] world but that day your
[1:21:59] soul became an upward current
[1:22:02] right which would mean a the aony of God
[1:22:05] right because that soul is eternal amen
[1:22:08] right justification doesn't make it
[1:22:11] Eternal sanctification doesn't make it
[1:22:14] Eternal the new birth makes it Eternal
[1:22:17] God's Own Life coming in you
[1:22:20] amen coming into your and making your
[1:22:23] soul Eternal
[1:22:27] right but you see we go into all of that
[1:22:29] you know but but is it two people or is
[1:22:33] it
[1:22:35] to let me answer the question like
[1:22:41] this until we heard of this prophet's
[1:22:45] message I'm
[1:22:48] sorry I'm sorry to make this statement
[1:22:51] but I'll make it
[1:22:53] until we heard of this prophet's message
[1:22:55] we didn't know what a soul was we didn't
[1:22:58] know what a spirit was we didn't even
[1:23:00] hardly know what a body was right right
[1:23:04] but we have become to the we didn't know
[1:23:06] the word theophany you never heard that
[1:23:08] in our denominations we didn't know
[1:23:10] logos and we didn't know that until we
[1:23:12] come into the message but how we become
[1:23:16] then so intellectually
[1:23:20] educated until
[1:23:23] now we know the whole
[1:23:28] plan but I
[1:23:32] thought that we could go back
[1:23:34] and study the message of
[1:23:38] Jesus and saying why it starting off
[1:23:41] that you must be born
[1:23:44] again and that it would be picked up by
[1:23:46] their disciples and they would preach
[1:23:48] about eternal
[1:23:50] life and the great apostles Paul would
[1:23:53] even prophesy of the future of the
[1:23:56] coming of the Rapture you know be
[1:23:57] changed in a moment twinkl and I yet he
[1:24:00] never left us
[1:24:02] dangling and Peter wouldn't when he
[1:24:04] would say Being Born Again by The
[1:24:06] Incorruptible word of
[1:24:10] God but those people had to go by the
[1:24:13] grave because they didn't attain un
[1:24:17] that's right what they spoke of
[1:24:21] righten but some body is not going to go
[1:24:24] by the grave
[1:24:26] amen so we're going to become Eternal
[1:24:28] here
[1:24:30] right so this is the main place I want
[1:24:33] to stay you
[1:24:34] know I want to stay right here where God
[1:24:37] is dealing with mankind
[1:24:41] amen I'd like to be here when the change
[1:24:43] comes I'd like to see it
[1:24:47] amen but if I don't I'm not worried
[1:24:50] about
[1:24:51] it
[1:24:54] sister Ceta used to say if I go by the
[1:24:57] grave you remember this one she said
[1:24:59] I'll just beat you
[1:25:00] up see cuz you're going to raise first
[1:25:04] that's probably 40 years ago right maybe
[1:25:06] a little more than that that statement
[1:25:08] was made I got a decent memory about
[1:25:10] some things you and to me that's a good
[1:25:14] point if I die I just beat you up I'm
[1:25:18] going to be up before you get your
[1:25:21] change
[1:25:23] so it's not worried about the
[1:25:26] Rapture I'm concerned with the preaching
[1:25:29] of the Gospel to get the dead raised
[1:25:32] that's it cuz that's the next
[1:25:34] step the next step is a dead to be
[1:25:37] raised then the Rapture will
[1:25:42] come that we all go up together right
[1:25:46] but I don't believe the Dead's going to
[1:25:48] raise corruptible that's right right
[1:25:53] I don't believe that the Dead's going to
[1:25:55] raise and then we got to preach
[1:25:56] something to them to make their bodies
[1:25:58] Eternal I don't think that now I think
[1:26:01] that that's going to be that
[1:26:04] part but I think that's why the Bible
[1:26:06] says they without us cannot be made
[1:26:09] complete is that the word perfect amen
[1:26:13] complete without you and I so they're
[1:26:16] waiting on you and I amen that's right
[1:26:19] we've got the message that's right we're
[1:26:22] not looking for another messenger come
[1:26:24] on that's right well why do you want to
[1:26:28] rear greet want to rear some out of the
[1:26:30] gre's
[1:26:32] almanac you know it's good to find out
[1:26:35] how to
[1:26:37] plant but I always tell everybody they
[1:26:40] say gre's Almanac says according to the
[1:26:42] Moon I don't plan on the
[1:26:45] moon I plant in the
[1:26:51] ground
[1:26:54] would you understand what I'm saying
[1:26:55] come on Brothers
[1:26:57] musicians I
[1:26:59] believe that every person has a body
[1:27:03] that they step over into the second
[1:27:05] death takes you you step in not step
[1:27:08] over into that's right it's just you
[1:27:11] going
[1:27:13] somewhere you just exit this part amen
[1:27:17] that everybody can see Hallelujah and if
[1:27:19] you're a born again
[1:27:21] Christian you just exit this and right
[1:27:23] into eternity as far as being it but
[1:27:26] it's already
[1:27:28] Eternal but R said I don't believe in
[1:27:30] what the Mormon doctrine of
[1:27:32] pre-existence 154 Church age book
[1:27:35] transmigration or reincarnation he
[1:27:37] didn't believe transmigration means to
[1:27:39] go from one body to another is there a
[1:27:41] body up there waiting on us to step into
[1:27:43] that
[1:27:44] body or is that body the body of the
[1:27:48] word as he's revealing it to you he
[1:27:54] amen that way I believe your soul is
[1:27:57] your
[1:27:58] theophany then there's only one
[1:28:00] theophany that's Eternal that's it so
[1:28:03] Genesis 1:26 and 27 is talking about you
[1:28:08] that are a born again believer this
[1:28:13] day when it says let us make man in our
[1:28:17] image that man is eternal am
[1:28:23] y but you must receive it to have
[1:28:26] eternal life
[1:28:28] amen not just a knowledge that this
[1:28:31] message come we understand this out of
[1:28:32] the other
[1:28:37] no brother Bram said what we need to
[1:28:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost more than
[1:28:41] anything it's the most important thing
[1:28:43] in your
[1:28:44] life that's right is whether or not
[1:28:46] you're born again let's stand together
[1:28:49] what we got 16 spiral book
[1:29:03] transition Earth
[1:29:10] can
[1:29:11] build
[1:29:13] your things
[1:29:20] ET God
[1:29:22] brother Dale you don't believe we got
[1:29:24] something up there the positive of God's
[1:29:27] mind is pulling
[1:29:30] us don't ever say that I don't believe
[1:29:32] in something positive pulling
[1:29:38] up don't say that I don't believe in
[1:29:41] being born
[1:29:42] again by The Incorruptible
[1:29:47] word The Plan of
[1:29:50] Redemption brought to us God's
[1:29:56] unchanging to understand and
[1:29:59] trust in him who will
[1:30:15] not by Earthly friends
[1:30:20] for
[1:30:28] I was talking with Brother Gary the
[1:30:29] other day and I said here we are talking
[1:30:32] about eternal
[1:30:34] life here we are talking about a
[1:30:38] change and yet you're laying there in
[1:30:41] that
[1:30:46] condition I've seen the dead
[1:30:49] raise I don't worry about that
[1:30:52] but you know what you're not going to
[1:30:53] make it
[1:30:58] work you're not going to make it
[1:31:00] work don't you ever get that
[1:31:06] idea it's when God comes down
[1:31:12] himself cuz only God can raise the
[1:31:17] dead you said well why don't you just
[1:31:20] speak the word
[1:31:22] I have I said Brother Gary I Believe by
[1:31:25] Stripes you're healed they will never
[1:31:28] pass away I believe
[1:31:31] that beyond that I cannot go any
[1:31:38] further now come
