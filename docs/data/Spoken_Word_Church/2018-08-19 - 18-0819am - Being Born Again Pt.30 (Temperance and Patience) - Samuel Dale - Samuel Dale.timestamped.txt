[29:45] being born again not of corruptible seed
[29:48] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[29:52] which liveth and abideth for ever
[29:56] alright let's go then to 2nd Peter one
[30:00] will begin verse 1 Simon Peter servant
[30:04] and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[30:06] have obtained like precious faith with
[30:09] us
[30:09] through the righteousness of God and our
[30:11] Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[30:14] multiplied unto you through the
[30:16] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[30:19] according as his divine power hath given
[30:23] unto us all things that pertain unto
[30:26] life and godliness through the knowledge
[30:28] of him that have called us to glory and
[30:31] virtue whereby are given unto us
[30:34] exceeding great and precious promises
[30:37] that by these you might be partakers of
[30:40] the divine nature having escaped the
[30:42] corruption that is in the world through
[30:44] lust and beside this giving all
[30:46] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[30:49] to virtue knowledge into knowledge
[30:51] temperance and to temperance patience
[30:53] and to patience godliness and to
[30:55] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[30:59] brotherly kindness charity amen
[31:02] you may be seated the Lord that is
[31:05] blessing to the reading of the word and
[31:09] I hope that your thoughts has been
[31:13] enhanced some because some of the
[31:16] Brethren came right down the same line
[31:18] and the thoughts and things that we were
[31:20] trying to bring you know and maybe it
[31:23] hope you know would help us to
[31:25] understand and open up or understand
[31:28] the word because we believe faith comes
[31:30] by hearing and hearing by the word amen
[31:33] all right now we are talking about the
[31:37] stature of a perfect man and knowing for
[31:40] a surety that these things that we read
[31:45] of that we read here in the scripture if
[31:47] it was not necessary for someone then it
[31:53] would never have been written in the
[31:56] Word of God all right
[31:57] and we believe that this is the final
[32:00] age the winding up of all things so
[32:04] everything would wind up in this age and
[32:06] be made manifest by this endtime people
[32:10] to bring forth you know whatever is for
[32:14] the day an hour which is really to
[32:16] finish up all things and then you know
[32:19] bring it to a completion bring it to a
[32:22] finished product that we could see the
[32:25] day in the hour that we're living now we
[32:28] talked about and we you know as message
[32:30] believers we're talking about say the
[32:32] faith of the fathers and and all like
[32:35] that we we've mentioned that a lot maybe
[32:37] in the messages and what is that that is
[32:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ that was
[32:44] given to the Apostles and as we covered
[32:48] our in a message or so that this Peter
[32:52] is writing the word you know this is the
[32:54] writing of the word where we were
[32:56] reading of the first Peter second Peter
[32:58] order that's the writing of the word of
[33:00] God all right and then bringing forth
[33:03] the things that God says we must have
[33:06] all right and seeing that then we we
[33:10] realized something has to take place
[33:12] because if God requires as one of the
[33:16] brothers was talking there in the
[33:18] message of be therefore perfect you know
[33:21] if God requires perfection then he has
[33:25] to bring it alright if he requires these
[33:29] virtues to be in the bride in the end
[33:33] time then he will provide a way and he
[33:36] has he's provided the message to be
[33:39] brought unto us that we can read
[33:42] the message and study it and read the
[33:44] Bible and do and you know as I was
[33:47] bringing out in one of the messages or
[33:48] the other day the Prophet never came to
[33:52] bring us a different Bible or this that
[33:54] or the other he came to turn our hearts
[33:57] back to the original Word it's not
[34:01] another Bible it's not an edition it's
[34:03] not something extra you know added it is
[34:07] the Word of God for the day and the time
[34:10] all right and then seeing this would be
[34:14] the hour that we're living then these
[34:18] virtues would be required in this age
[34:21] may be not required in other ages coming
[34:25] down because of the loss of the word you
[34:29] know the the point of were that the bugs
[34:32] ate it down and in losing the revealed
[34:36] word that the original apostles came out
[34:39] with but we were promised in this day
[34:42] tuber to bring forth you know that God
[34:46] would restore those things to you and I
[34:49] all right so then the faith of the
[34:51] fathers has got to be restored and see
[34:54] you'd say what do we need that well now
[34:58] don't guess we do if we're going by the
[35:00] grave did that get through we don't need
[35:07] it if we're going by the grave if we're
[35:10] gonna miss this all right we don't need
[35:12] it no no just eat drink and be merry to
[35:14] have a good time you know
[35:15] what you see for forty over almost fifty
[35:19] years I've preached on this thought an
[35:23] idea that this of the writing here if
[35:29] God required it number one he'd supply
[35:33] the wafer to be done
[35:35] right to bring it forth and number two
[35:38] it would have to be brought forth
[35:39] because he said it would all right and
[35:44] when God says something we can depend
[35:46] upon that to be able to walk in the
[35:49] light of his word paragraph 148 statue
[35:52] of a perfect man brother Brennan said
[35:54] that the disciple
[35:55] had these virtues these qualities and
[35:59] things and said they had the least
[36:01] little nod from God to know what God
[36:04] wanted and see they needed that little
[36:06] nod from God to write the word because
[36:09] that's what they were doing they were
[36:10] actually in the time of the writing of
[36:13] the scriptures so you can say well now
[36:15] Jesus done this but see he didn't he
[36:17] didn't write the things that the
[36:20] disciples brought sure he brought the
[36:23] word which is all of the word in his
[36:25] message but the disciples then begin to
[36:28] bring forth the word to us to help us to
[36:32] see and understand where we're to live
[36:35] in what were to do alright so then it's
[36:38] in this age as I said maybe not down
[36:41] through the time of the Dark Ages and
[36:43] Luther Wesley and Pentecost etc they
[36:47] were required to have a new birth all
[36:51] right
[36:52] they require death and they received
[36:54] that okay they had their day they had
[36:58] their time okay you know that's well and
[37:01] good but now you and I have to have our
[37:03] day and it's time and to recognize the
[37:07] word for this hour is the unveiling of
[37:10] all of the Word of God right it's to
[37:15] bring forth all the Word of God in this
[37:17] age and that's why God had to send a
[37:19] prophet to bring it forth to us that we
[37:24] would have these things and we've been
[37:26] through that as to how do we get these
[37:28] virtues we've been through that over and
[37:32] over on 327 Church age book this
[37:34] messenger Malachi 4 look at 17:30 we'll
[37:37] do two things 1 turn the hearts of the
[37:38] children back to faith of the father's
[37:40] you know and and reveal the thunders
[37:42] which is a revelation contained in the
[37:44] seven sealed it be these divinely
[37:46] revealed that mystery truths that
[37:47] literally turn us back all right and see
[37:51] then God sent the Prophet with the
[37:55] message we believe that okay then he
[37:58] said in his word that the fivefold
[38:01] ministry would be for the perfecting of
[38:03] the saints or you know as the Prophet
[38:05] said in the in the statute of perfect
[38:07] man are they bringing forth of these
[38:08] things
[38:09] all right so now God has given us then
[38:13] the message and then we've had 50 years
[38:17] almost from the time of the passing of
[38:20] the prophet for the bride to be able to
[38:24] walk in the light of the word and to
[38:27] understand and he gave us a fivefold
[38:29] ministry not a onefold there is no such
[38:33] thing in the Bible as to try to find a
[38:35] onefold no what would you fold you know
[38:40] I mean you just take that one that would
[38:41] just be round it wouldn't fold right I
[38:44] mean that's silly but it's truth there's
[38:47] a five fold ministry for the perfecting
[38:50] or the bringing of these things all
[38:53] right so we've had 50 years to preach on
[38:56] it and I don't back up no way I said all
[39:00] he just said no there's people sitting
[39:02] here that's been here almost the 50
[39:05] years that we've been 40 some years and
[39:07] they know that this is what I've been
[39:09] teaching all of the time the statue of a
[39:11] perfect man the growth development the
[39:14] adoptions the things that you and I
[39:16] would have to have all right and in
[39:20] doing that see it would be a requirement
[39:22] now listen to where we we stopped off
[39:25] for a long time ago but just go ahead
[39:28] brothers and pull up number one on the
[39:30] only there's notes and let's just read a
[39:35] little bit and listen to what he's
[39:37] saying and see whether it's very
[39:39] important that you and I understand okay
[39:42] go ahead and roll it up to the to the
[39:47] now what but each age God has placed
[39:51] these things into his church now listen
[39:54] and pattern it by showing that each
[39:58] individual has these things possesses
[40:04] these qualities and wants it and this
[40:07] being when it's completed is the Church
[40:11] of God the church now watch it this
[40:15] being this stature of a perfect man
[40:18] this being
[40:22] when it's completed is the Church of God
[40:26] going in the rapture now listen going to
[40:34] rapture and this being what's it now now
[40:40] that's the church that's the whole all
[40:43] the ages that's everything now what and
[40:46] this being and completed is the servant
[40:52] of God in the Church of God that's going
[40:57] in the rapture see what I mean
[41:00] there you are there's the full thing all
[41:04] right now so then this would be pointing
[41:08] to this age because this is the age of
[41:12] the finish so now looking at the church
[41:15] as a whole this is the seventh church
[41:18] age this is the life stage all right so
[41:22] this is the age of the rapture the
[41:25] rapture the rapture is going to come in
[41:28] the 7th church age all right because
[41:30] they're not in a church age we'll get to
[41:33] that another couple of messages on the
[41:34] thought all right but now so within this
[41:38] church this this Church of God no not
[41:42] the name of God you know like
[41:44] congregational holiness or whatever it
[41:46] is you know no this bride of Jesus
[41:50] Christ all right
[41:53] the Church of the Living God has got to
[41:56] have these virtues to go in a rapture
[42:00] well you say well brother Dale down to
[42:03] the ages they didn't have it you just
[42:04] said they didn't that's exactly right so
[42:06] the Bible's right they without us cannot
[42:11] be Hebrews 4 11:40 they without us
[42:16] cannot be made perfect or complete are
[42:19] finished are come to full stature
[42:23] alright so this is the age this is the
[42:27] age that the message came this is the
[42:30] age that God has predestinated a group
[42:33] of people
[42:35] and a fivefold ministry to bring the
[42:37] Word of God all right so you know of
[42:43] course you've got all this going now
[42:45] around the country you know about
[42:46] playing the tapes and everything else
[42:48] you know and all that that's their
[42:50] business that ain't nothing to me
[42:52] I just can't find that in the Bible that
[42:54] the playing of the tapes is for the
[42:56] perfecting of the science if you find
[42:59] out you come and tell me all right I can
[43:01] find where it says the fivefold ministry
[43:03] Hope over but brother Dale everybody
[43:06] believes the fivefold ministry oh that's
[43:07] a way of believing in the fivefold
[43:09] ministry that you can bypass everything
[43:11] so you can say I believe in if I fold
[43:14] ministry yeah but I think the fivefold
[43:17] ministry supposed to play the tapes so
[43:19] you don't put those two dollars into
[43:22] understanding you just put the will of
[43:25] the brother or just eternal said they
[43:28] believe in the fivefold ministry yeah
[43:30] but you don't put the other with it
[43:34] because the other relates to it just
[43:37] play the tapes well thank God praise God
[43:42] glory hallelujah we play the tapes we
[43:46] listen to the Word of God amen if you
[43:51] don't play the tape listen to the Word
[43:53] of God then you're starving your own
[43:55] self to death and don't tell me you're
[44:00] going into change don't tell me your
[44:05] rapture buy them because what everybody
[44:07] say oh boy glory hallelujah we're
[44:09] hearing rats we just waiting on that
[44:11] final one see that we find it well
[44:16] praise God
[44:17] the brother branham's just said that
[44:22] they'd be a church that would go in the
[44:27] rapture then he said there's individuals
[44:34] that will make up that Church in other
[44:37] words that will go in the rapture
[44:42] all right and see if they're going in
[44:45] the rapture the servant of God that's
[44:48] going in to rapture what is he referring
[44:50] to why would he be referring because
[44:54] every age goes in the rapture there's a
[44:58] there's a bride of every age every age
[45:03] has a group of people that will go in
[45:05] the rapture but why would the Scriptures
[45:10] say they without us cannot be made
[45:12] perfect why would the Prophet emphasize
[45:15] this is the church that's going in the
[45:17] rapture and these are the individuals
[45:19] that's going in the right that has these
[45:22] virtues what about those that don't have
[45:25] these virtues or didn't get these
[45:27] virtually because it died and went into
[45:29] the ground are they gonna be sit come on
[45:35] now get it to the right understanding
[45:40] Peter of them had the Word of God right
[45:47] Satan come in and pervert it and pulled
[45:50] it down but Martin Luther started out
[45:53] with a new birth and he's part of the
[45:54] Church of the Living God and he will go
[45:58] in the rapture one day
[46:02] Wesly Pentecost whatever you know they
[46:04] will go in the rapture of being the
[46:07] bride of that age but they're waiting on
[46:10] somebody to attain to a position what
[46:17] waiting on somebody to receive these
[46:20] virtues all right now listen to what I'm
[46:27] saying you can just you can do not like
[46:29] what I say or whatever but I try my best
[46:32] this be as straight as I can in that way
[46:34] you don't you can't you don't walk and
[46:36] tell nobody I don't know what he's
[46:37] talking about
[46:38] well boys you in bad shape you don't
[46:40] know what I'm talking about because I
[46:41] plain about what I'm talking about you
[46:45] know there's not going to be now here's
[46:47] no brother Dale okay there's not going
[46:50] to be a bride to go in a rapture unless
[46:55] the end time
[46:56] reaches the stature of a perfect man now
[47:04] let's get another one code we're gonna
[47:06] read the next quote there's not going to
[47:09] be a resurrection unless somebody
[47:16] attains to the position of these virtues
[47:19] yeah but brother Dale you're making yeah
[47:23] I'm a just I'm not saying this I'm
[47:25] reading what he said I mean have I
[47:32] become your enemy because I found the
[47:34] quote God I found the prophet says this
[47:40] what brother Dale you just try to be
[47:42] fine oh okay I'm trying to be what I am
[47:45] go ahead to the let's see go ahead do
[47:55] the same quote we were using it's just
[47:57] on down all right so then what does he
[48:02] go to and say now listen to it 367
[48:05] paragraph their stature of perfect man
[48:08] you get it these people who died in here
[48:11] are depending and waiting on us okay so
[48:18] this church has got to come to
[48:22] perfection
[48:23] now that was paragraph 354 that we were
[48:26] just on about possessing in the church
[48:28] to go in the rapture and the individual
[48:31] this is paragraph 364
[48:33] 67 they just moved over a little bit so
[48:36] read it so this church has gotta come to
[48:39] a perfection in order to bring the
[48:42] resurrection there under souls under the
[48:49] altar waiting for this church to come to
[48:51] its perfection that when Christ does
[48:53] come in this church you see is coming
[48:58] smaller into minority that one refers to
[49:01] the chart war it's a whole lot sharper
[49:03] than that but that's just to write that
[49:05] roaster to come up to the needle point
[49:07] and place and it coming up when the
[49:09] headstone comes
[49:10] now watch what is business and when it
[49:12] comes this church has got to be honed
[49:15] all these rest of the stones in the
[49:18] pyramid are laying so perfectly - you
[49:22] can't run a razor blade what's he
[49:24] talking about
[49:25] the stature of a perfect man is the
[49:30] honing of the church right it'll have to
[49:33] be so perfectly like Christ still when
[49:36] he comes he and that ministry will fit
[49:39] right smack together then will come the
[49:41] rapture that won't home now that's what
[49:44] your prophet is saying in the stature of
[49:46] a perfect man that we've asked you to
[49:48] read and study it see then he's
[49:55] explaining the whole thing there's not
[49:57] going to be a rapture unless somebody
[50:01] reaches the position of these virtues
[50:05] into manifestation I don't mind saying
[50:10] that cuz that's what he just said
[50:12] there's not going to be a resurrection
[50:15] now remember see we don't think about it
[50:19] a lot of things but remember in the
[50:22] Bible that's why I quit years ago
[50:25] looking for a rapture there because that
[50:30] ain't biblical that ain't Scripture
[50:40] scripturally it's what resurrection
[50:44] comes first then rapture comes after
[50:50] resurrection is that scripture Lord
[50:53] himself shall descend heaven with us not
[50:54] boys market don't God and the dead in
[50:57] Christ shall rise first and we were to
[50:59] rob and remain unto the coming of the
[51:01] Lord then it'll be changed that's Bible
[51:03] so we need to look for a resurrection
[51:09] then the Prophet we just read it the
[51:13] church has got to come to perfection in
[51:16] order to bring the resurrection
[51:22] the church has got to come to perfect
[51:26] how is that coming to perfection
[51:27] the statue of a perfect man coming to
[51:32] perfection to bring a resurrection so
[51:36] it's dependent on you and me it's
[51:42] totally dependent on whether or not we
[51:45] can become what God says we will and you
[51:49] know don't worry about if somebody will
[51:51] but now that's our choice to make
[51:53] ourselves a part of it things I'm saying
[51:59] our moment ago why would he put rapture
[52:02] into that I can follow resurrection
[52:04] because it comes fir but then he would
[52:06] take rapture and put it right in it that
[52:08] there's not going to be a rapture on
[52:10] this block that somebody becomes the
[52:14] stature of a perfect man why would you
[52:18] call it rapture when we know every body
[52:21] and every age will go in a rapture right
[52:26] but just remember one time there's not
[52:30] going to be a change the moment the
[52:33] twinkling of an eye can I restate it
[52:36] there's not going to be a change in a
[52:39] moment in the twinkling of an eye unless
[52:43] somebody comes to that position well I
[52:50] just don't see that okay that does that
[52:54] change it and stop it from being true
[52:56] have I read to you out of this series in
[53:00] trying to study the stature of a perfect
[53:02] man have I read to you what the Prophet
[53:04] said well then it's not what I'm saying
[53:09] you know what you're trying to interpret
[53:11] it I don't know how to interpret all
[53:13] that gotta do is read it you don't need
[53:16] interpreting he's reading
[53:18] he needs believing where's the
[53:21] interpretation would have to be to the
[53:23] point to where he was said in other
[53:25] words plain language is not going to be
[53:26] a rapture unless somebody has these
[53:29] virtues is that what we just read
[53:33] there's not going to be a resurrection
[53:36] unless somebody the church has got to
[53:38] come to perfection all right why the end
[53:48] we have any problem will not believe
[53:52] what he's saying it'll have to be so
[53:55] perfectly like Christ to when he comes
[53:59] he and that ministry will fit right
[54:04] smack together see then will come the
[54:06] rapture the going home now we've already
[54:13] had the Ministry of Malachi for right
[54:19] you agree we've had the Ministry of
[54:21] Malachi 4:2 the perfection so then what
[54:31] are we waiting on
[54:35] we're waiting on somebody to believe it
[54:38] accept it and think about it as being
[54:41] for them
[54:44] is that true then see then you see one
[54:50] that I'm so hard about the way that I
[54:53] try to bring things because it's not
[54:56] whether or not what that's the way you
[54:58] think I think it's this way well what
[55:01] you thinking what I think ain't got
[55:02] nothing to do with it it's what God said
[55:08] it right he said they would be a bride
[55:17] he said now throughout the scripture
[55:20] pointing that they'd be a bride --it
[55:22] they'd be a resurrection that they'd be
[55:23] a rapture so he's gonna have to provide
[55:27] the way to be done so he has he brought
[55:30] us the message he brought the Prophet
[55:32] now he's got the fivefold ministry to
[55:34] take that from taught to prophetess
[55:36] brought and I preached it over and over
[55:38] to you not that the fivefold ministry is
[55:40] gonna get anything different no Kuster
[55:42] five full minutes don't even have a
[55:43] message you didn't listen when I said
[55:46] dad you don't listen to those statements
[55:48] they don't have a man
[55:50] I don't have a message brother don't
[55:53] know I only can have what they've
[55:56] already brought those prior to me has
[56:00] already brought it why do I need a
[56:01] message
[56:02] I need a quickening of the message to
[56:05] the word to be made alive to me that I
[56:08] can believe myself where I'm standing in
[56:11] what's going on right but there's
[56:16] nothing - looking for another message to
[56:18] come uh-huh see that's where you're
[56:19] wrong
[56:21] well brother so and so he gives in we're
[56:23] losing we'll go with brother so-and-so
[56:25] the only thing I've ever said is you're
[56:28] getting older I'm getting older if they
[56:31] somebody else supposed to lead this
[56:33] thing oh we need to find out who it is
[56:35] and get Go Go we're getting older right
[56:43] we'll see I don't worry about it I
[56:45] believe the message that has already
[56:46] been brought that's why for over 40
[56:52] years I've stood in hollered about this
[56:55] message well brother Daniel we've gotten
[56:58] brother so-and-so he hollered at 40
[56:59] years now he's gone
[57:02] what are you doing wishing I go hit is
[57:07] that the point what's the point of
[57:09] saying it well they stay quit no they
[57:11] didn't stay with there's something wrong
[57:12] with them all alone now you can't tell
[57:14] me that so don't even talk to me about
[57:15] don't tell me brother so-and-so spent 40
[57:18] years preaching this message to the word
[57:20] the letter and the truth of it and
[57:22] brought it right and then went off of it
[57:25] I'm gonna tell you I don't believe you I
[57:29] don't tell you I don't believe you
[57:32] wouldn't know though they had something
[57:34] wrong all the way down through that
[57:37] right you want to name a few of them and
[57:40] then we'll get started on it they had
[57:42] things wrong to start with right they
[57:48] had their own ideas and thoughts to
[57:50] start with they didn't follow the
[57:53] prophets message because if you got the
[57:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's it's
[57:57] impossible for you to turn against this
[58:00] message
[58:01] I don't care who you are you just didn't
[58:06] have it to start with why not admit it
[58:10] like I said the other day I listen to
[58:13] these messages two or three times since
[58:15] I've kind of been on vacation I listen
[58:16] to my own self but I was talking about
[58:18] these people what are they going to
[58:20] convert us to you know somebody come
[58:24] along tell you this profit is wrong what
[58:26] are they trying to convert us to they're
[58:30] trying to convert us to them come on
[58:32] wake up
[58:34] then you don't pittypat well the brother
[58:37] defect is his way of seeing it we just
[58:40] supposed to love him and you got nothing
[58:42] to do with it I like what wasn't said
[58:47] you know what listen let me get talking
[58:48] about the love how it was he's supposed
[58:52] to love me just as much if you differ
[58:53] with me if you do if you don't differ
[58:56] women that's not exactly the quote with
[58:58] the point well you know that's easy if
[59:02] you didn't love me to start with okay
[59:07] you get it if you didn't love me to
[59:11] start with you ain't got no problems you
[59:13] just say I don't like it
[59:17] listen Church I think it's time for us
[59:21] to root to get down into and walk in the
[59:26] light of the love of God and tell all
[59:31] this junk that's floating around it to
[59:32] go peddle it some words out you know I
[59:36] mean you know come on all right so we've
[59:44] been through these things and we've come
[59:45] up and that was just a point I wanted to
[59:48] inject because I've tried to emphasize
[59:50] that in the message that we must have
[59:54] these virtues to make a change or the
[59:59] body and by making the change of the
[1:00:04] body will make the way for the
[1:00:06] perfection for the others to come forth
[1:00:09] so that means resurrection comes first
[1:00:15] the resurrection is dependent upon you
[1:00:18] right it's dependent upon you and me
[1:00:29] we'll see then let's get down to our
[1:00:32] part or at least admit it's that well
[1:00:33] hey looks like we don't have nothing if
[1:00:39] we can't even agree with the Prophet we
[1:00:40] surely don't have nothing and he was the
[1:00:44] one that said that these people this
[1:00:46] church would go in the rapture this
[1:00:49] individual person that would come to
[1:00:51] these virtues would be the one that
[1:00:53] would go in the change of the body of
[1:00:54] the rapture and he says that would be in
[1:00:57] the resurrection would be because of the
[1:00:59] people of this message that has become
[1:01:01] the statue of a perfect man but you see
[1:01:10] that's where we take all of that things
[1:01:12] you know well I just don't see it we'll
[1:01:14] see that's what that's not what you're
[1:01:16] looking at you're not looking in the
[1:01:18] right order I preached a whole service
[1:01:21] into that trying my best and crying out
[1:01:23] in my heart to get you to see one time
[1:01:29] we were supposed to been Christians for
[1:01:31] we ever heard of the Prophet if we had
[1:01:34] the new birth the Prophet didn't have to
[1:01:38] come to teach the people that already
[1:01:42] had the new birth that it was wrong to
[1:01:45] sin I'm glad the Prophet Cohn showed us
[1:01:51] on the straighten us out on adultery and
[1:01:53] straighten us out on on killing and
[1:01:55] murderers and all these things and I'm
[1:01:57] glad he come and straitness out on all
[1:01:58] that my lord he didn't have to come to
[1:02:03] straighten that the new birth was
[1:02:05] supposed to straighten out a lot in our
[1:02:07] hearts and lives when the Prophet come
[1:02:12] well we found out it was wrong to cut
[1:02:14] her the Bible said it was wrong what was
[1:02:21] the problem we didn't believe it then we
[1:02:26] don't believe it now that's the problem
[1:02:31] well you just don't understand this and
[1:02:33] that's what I'm say it we didn't believe
[1:02:35] it back then we don't believe it now
[1:02:37] that's our problem lip service is one
[1:02:44] thing but serving God is another thing
[1:02:48] don't you think it's time to start
[1:02:50] settling down and serving God you so
[1:02:52] well we've got these problems well see
[1:02:57] you don't like for me to talk well
[1:03:00] brother then we just got these problems
[1:03:02] we're gonna be human until the change
[1:03:05] comes the Prophet said we're gonna be
[1:03:08] stickers till the change come now you
[1:03:10] say you try just fast we don't know no
[1:03:13] no no I'm telling you the truth is that
[1:03:17] what he said did he say we would be
[1:03:22] stickers as long as we were in these
[1:03:24] flesh
[1:03:25] well I'd he's the one that done it not
[1:03:28] me
[1:03:29] well brother though I think you're
[1:03:31] trying to put it work we can just live
[1:03:33] like the devil huh no that wouldn't dare
[1:03:37] when I was in the Baptist Church
[1:03:38] so let's don't start on it now you see
[1:03:44] Church I'm trying to get me and you to a
[1:03:46] point this message brought to the people
[1:03:53] and revealed to the people is to bring
[1:03:57] us to a change is that true a lot see
[1:04:06] then it's not waiting on something of
[1:04:08] this that or the other it's settled in
[1:04:11] Christ and the only thing that I've ever
[1:04:14] said about anything and I'm playing
[1:04:16] blunt and plummeting but you say I'm
[1:04:18] waiting on the bus to pull up now you
[1:04:21] can aim that bus anything you want to
[1:04:23] return ministries tents or whatever you
[1:04:25] can name anything you won't do that's
[1:04:27] your business because I've never been
[1:04:29] but one time you can't get on the bus at
[1:04:34] the airport the bus don't go to the
[1:04:38] airport
[1:04:40] the bus goes to the bus station so get
[1:04:43] word about station now not is that
[1:04:47] simple is that hard is that contrary is
[1:04:51] that arrogance are hateful no so why is
[1:04:55] it if this message is to bring us a
[1:04:57] change was any problem about spraying
[1:05:00] them studying and reading it we have a
[1:05:07] Bible study the first Saturday of every
[1:05:10] month we have a pretty good attendance
[1:05:15] we have a pretty good attendance but a
[1:05:18] lot of you don't come well I ain't got
[1:05:20] time you got time to go to Walmart you
[1:05:23] got time to go everywhere there you got
[1:05:25] time to do everything else but you ain't
[1:05:27] got time to come and sit down talk about
[1:05:30] the word that's your business
[1:05:32] well you think we ought to be here no
[1:05:35] I'm not telling you anything you always
[1:05:37] say it they shouldn't be that I would
[1:05:40] say it you ought to say it and if you
[1:05:47] don't say it then I doubt your new birth
[1:05:48] okay
[1:05:50] brother Dale wasn't lying why go we do
[1:05:53] all we try to that we can to have
[1:05:56] services and things for you to come and
[1:06:00] the Bible study is one time you can come
[1:06:03] and bring up anything you want to and
[1:06:05] we'll discuss that and we've spend two
[1:06:13] hours discussing them wait okay
[1:06:18] what of me you done made you excuse
[1:06:25] okay all right go with it now where did
[1:06:30] we come up to so we come through knowing
[1:06:33] that we have to how these virtues so we
[1:06:36] have faith and be born again and then we
[1:06:41] must have virtue added to the faith and
[1:06:43] it must be the same kind of faith you
[1:06:46] know must be the virtue must be the same
[1:06:50] kind of Revelation as the original birth
[1:06:53] because when you start talking about as
[1:06:56] we did on the last one or so they're
[1:06:58] about the vulcanizing the material that
[1:07:01] you don't vulcanize a piece of wood you
[1:07:04] know or a piece of leather or something
[1:07:06] like that to an iron piece it won't work
[1:07:10] it's got to be the same material so the
[1:07:12] new birth is faith the born-again
[1:07:14] experience the revelation of Jesus
[1:07:16] Christ the Prophet says Christ to the
[1:07:18] mystery of God revealed what is the new
[1:07:20] birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus
[1:07:22] Christ personally do you know that's the
[1:07:25] new birth all right so what would be
[1:07:28] virtue then it would have to be the
[1:07:31] virtues of Almighty God to be given to
[1:07:33] us it's the virtue the knowledge the
[1:07:37] temperance all of that is God's virtues
[1:07:39] to be given to you and I to cool in our
[1:07:42] faith right and see then the virtues got
[1:07:48] to be the same material it's more of the
[1:07:53] new birth it's more of the growth in God
[1:07:56] it's more of the understanding of the
[1:07:58] word of God what is knowledge now
[1:08:10] remember we just finished that what is
[1:08:12] knowledge it's not head knowledge
[1:08:16] remember virtue we spent the time on
[1:08:20] that the Prophet said now and what would
[1:08:23] he emphasized stuff like that why would
[1:08:25] he make the statement he said not virtue
[1:08:27] he said that's that's not living a
[1:08:29] virgin life he says not in this case is
[1:08:39] he against living a virgin life no what
[1:08:43] was he doing trying to give us
[1:08:45] understanding of what the stature of a
[1:08:47] perfect land is to be poor takers of his
[1:08:49] divine nature and his divine nature
[1:08:52] would be his virtue his strength his
[1:08:56] power his life given unto each and every
[1:08:59] one of us that would be the virtue he's
[1:09:02] talking about that would be why he
[1:09:04] wouldn't be saying now not not to live a
[1:09:06] virgin
[1:09:07] I said not in this case he's emphasizing
[1:09:09] what is it meant like I said you could
[1:09:14] be a virgin being mean as a rattlesnake
[1:09:17] but get born again get born again it'll
[1:09:23] take care of every time then he can add
[1:09:29] his virtue to you and I and his
[1:09:32] knowledge it's not net it's not human
[1:09:36] knowledge it's not a matter of it's not
[1:09:38] Webster's definition of knowledge it's
[1:09:42] the Holy Ghost definition of faith which
[1:09:46] means the new birth right the Holy Ghost
[1:09:50] understanding of virtue that it means to
[1:09:56] live a a good Christian life to be a
[1:10:00] virtuous Christian to walk in the light
[1:10:04] of the love of God not just because
[1:10:07] you'd say well well I you know I need a
[1:10:09] I I'm not a virgin so I can't fit into
[1:10:12] this thing there's where you're
[1:10:15] misunderstanding if you get down to what
[1:10:19] the new birth is you might find out a
[1:10:21] lot of things and it's taken care of in
[1:10:24] our lives in the new world but it's holy
[1:10:33] ghost' knowledge it's holy ghost' virtue
[1:10:39] it's not the virtues of a human being in
[1:10:41] the point of just some virtues that we
[1:10:43] have it's a virtuous life of Christ
[1:10:47] living in each one of us
[1:10:55] and the knowledge what is knowledge is
[1:10:58] holy ghost knowledge it's not head
[1:11:01] knowledge it's not how much you know how
[1:11:03] much you've read or study
[1:11:05] it's how much is revealed to us because
[1:11:09] that's the only knowledge that is worth
[1:11:11] anything is holy ghost knowledge there's
[1:11:15] people that can quote you the Bible
[1:11:18] verbatim but that's hidden homage you
[1:11:24] remember the Prophet and what he brought
[1:11:25] about he said that's a nature given a
[1:11:32] nature given thing statue of perfect man
[1:11:36] and blasphemous names both let me
[1:11:37] covered it if you'll read it a nature
[1:11:41] given virtue is not what God is talking
[1:11:45] about a nature given knowledge is not
[1:11:49] what God's talking about that won't
[1:11:52] change nothing that just builds your
[1:11:55] knowledge puffeth up the scriptures it
[1:11:58] what holy ghost knowledge does it
[1:12:01] puffier no no no no no no that's not
[1:12:05] what it's saying right natural human
[1:12:10] knowledge purpose you up holy ghost
[1:12:16] knowledge we'll take you down so then
[1:12:23] what are we talking about these virtues
[1:12:26] these virtues our Holy Ghost virtues
[1:12:31] given to you and I to place upon our
[1:12:35] faith which is a Holy Ghost faith it's
[1:12:40] his faith given to you then it belongs
[1:12:43] to you
[1:12:44] now it's your faith cuz he gave it to
[1:12:46] you right now it's his virtue given to
[1:12:53] you to place on his faith which is your
[1:12:58] faith each one of them is God giving to
[1:13:01] you and I what he's doing because of our
[1:13:05] growth development
[1:13:08] in the word all right now but in it's so
[1:13:14] odd that a prophet would would cover
[1:13:16] like we went through with virtue how
[1:13:19] that he was covering that you know and
[1:13:21] he was saying he said now that's not the
[1:13:23] word here so now I don't care about your
[1:13:29] definition well president I looked at
[1:13:32] Virgil how Lord it means no I looked at
[1:13:35] what the Prophet said it meant you go
[1:13:39] what you think it means and I'm gonna go
[1:13:41] with what I believe the Prophet says it
[1:13:43] did right because he's the one supposed
[1:13:48] to be giving us the definition right now
[1:13:56] so is it when we come to this next one
[1:13:58] which is difference in difference
[1:14:05] definition to the natural Webster point
[1:14:08] goes back to a point of showing you that
[1:14:11] you don't suppose to drink alcohol
[1:14:16] that's what we know we use as the word
[1:14:19] temperance the Prophet said that doesn't
[1:14:22] mean that in this case so there's a
[1:14:28] different definition from what the
[1:14:32] Prophet could bring to you and I then
[1:14:36] what the literal wording is bringing to
[1:14:39] us right the literal wording of the
[1:14:45] Bible is talking about how is it Oh
[1:14:48] about the Antichrist let's see how is
[1:14:52] that statement I'll get it in a minute
[1:14:53] but anyhow deal ah little random tells
[1:15:00] you that the the ends and the buts and
[1:15:02] the Bible's in the right place right now
[1:15:04] what are you gonna do with this one he
[1:15:08] said but where it says the where it says
[1:15:11] a lie it should have been translated
[1:15:14] deal I now he's the one son told you the
[1:15:18] ends of the books in the right place
[1:15:21] right now he just changed the word right
[1:15:28] he changed it from a which could be
[1:15:31] anything to thee which is a singular the
[1:15:34] same lie that he told even the garden is
[1:15:36] the same lie he telling you and I right
[1:15:39] now right now did he change that or did
[1:15:43] he give us the recurrent definition he
[1:15:50] physically changed to read the word
[1:15:52] right from A to B then he looked like he
[1:16:02] condemned his own self because he said
[1:16:03] you can't change nothing well then he
[1:16:08] wasn't changing it to make it be
[1:16:10] anything never he was emphasizing the
[1:16:13] way that it's brought that it should be
[1:16:16] bringing D because D is a singular point
[1:16:19] and it's the same lie all the way
[1:16:21] through right then he hasn't changed the
[1:16:27] word no that the ends and the bus is in
[1:16:34] the still in the same place the right
[1:16:36] place he'd just given you a better
[1:16:37] definition when he says virtue and he
[1:16:49] says that's not drinking alcohol he's
[1:16:55] just giving us the Bible terminologies
[1:16:58] of Christianity they're not not
[1:17:02] temperance temperance coming unloads in
[1:17:05] it
[1:17:05] virtue and temperance there's two
[1:17:07] different two words that he changed both
[1:17:09] words right he changed to virtue and
[1:17:16] said it's not being a virgin life so
[1:17:22] that evidently is not what God was
[1:17:23] writing there I don't care if man wrote
[1:17:26] it down a dozen times he's telling us
[1:17:29] what God is saying
[1:17:34] temperance is not to stop drinking
[1:17:37] alcohol what is it it's the controlling
[1:17:43] of that temper now here's where we're
[1:17:46] gonna go for a minute I might as well
[1:17:47] nail this part down and finish the rest
[1:17:49] of it later is it possible for a
[1:17:57] born-again Christian to have a temper be
[1:18:06] careful how you answer that you answer
[1:18:10] it one way you're gonna be wrong you
[1:18:12] answered the other way you're gonna be
[1:18:13] wrong so the best thing to do is back up
[1:18:16] wait on the Prophet and let him decide
[1:18:18] because he's the only ones gonna be able
[1:18:20] to tell us what's right Roselle can't
[1:18:24] tell us what's right you can't tell us
[1:18:26] what's right we can't go to Webster and
[1:18:28] guess what right agreed so we go back
[1:18:34] and listen to the Prophet as he's trying
[1:18:37] to emphasize things and by doing that
[1:18:40] it'll open up the wording that you'll
[1:18:43] see that it's really holy ghost' virtue
[1:18:48] holy ghost' virtue is living a virtuous
[1:18:52] life not a virgin life in the basis of
[1:18:56] just being a natural virgin it's a
[1:19:00] virtuous it's Christ living in us I
[1:19:09] thought the prophets that during the
[1:19:11] book they were it's his virtue and said
[1:19:15] is to be like him see now all we want to
[1:19:18] go to the over to the strength part
[1:19:21] virtue means strength no though you're
[1:19:24] not you're going I said you answer the
[1:19:26] question one way you're going wrong you
[1:19:28] answer it the other way you're going
[1:19:29] wrong virtue is strength right virtue
[1:19:39] went out of Jesus right and healed the
[1:19:42] people
[1:19:43] virtue but why did it go out I mean
[1:19:51] you're setting some word and somebody
[1:19:53] walks in and you look at him and say
[1:19:55] he's God I believe he can heal me no
[1:19:59] there's got to be some reason while all
[1:20:02] them people cried out and said even the
[1:20:05] one you know and he said who is this
[1:20:07] going in other words he said it's the
[1:20:09] son of David and he said how mercy only
[1:20:14] son of David lady called him son of
[1:20:19] David had no right to do it
[1:20:21] are you listening we take our own
[1:20:31] wording our own thoughts about what
[1:20:34] things should be saying that's what I'm
[1:20:38] trying to get you to see why would a
[1:20:43] prophet say well the natural words are
[1:20:46] means virtue means a a virgin life I
[1:20:49] said that's not in this case he's
[1:20:52] showing you what the understanding of
[1:20:54] that word is he's showing you that you
[1:20:56] can be a virgin all the days of your
[1:20:58] life and still die and go to hell right
[1:21:01] it's wonderful commendable great but you
[1:21:05] can be ever better that'd be as mean as
[1:21:07] a rattlesnake then he said a virtuous
[1:21:14] life you see those people seem Jesus
[1:21:18] they seed him heal the sick and raise
[1:21:20] the dead cast out Devils and that made
[1:21:24] that virtuous part of it made it to
[1:21:28] where they could connect with him and
[1:21:30] that would bring the strength into view
[1:21:32] the strength wasn't in the wouldn't
[1:21:35] brought into view just because they knew
[1:21:36] that he done this that the other right
[1:21:40] when he healed that person and said
[1:21:46] virtue went out of him strength went out
[1:21:50] of him was you know what had caused it a
[1:21:53] virtuous life
[1:21:56] had caused him to come to a place that
[1:21:58] people could believe him right these
[1:22:05] artists were our problem is you remember
[1:22:08] what the Prophet said on virtue he said
[1:22:10] you see where well most of us gonna fall
[1:22:12] off right now because see we don't know
[1:22:16] what virtuous means we make it a virgin
[1:22:20] life or we making this another the other
[1:22:22] or we say oh it's not a virgin I see
[1:22:25] strength well how did the strength come
[1:22:29] out of him because they connected to the
[1:22:33] God that was in the flesh and then the
[1:22:36] flesh got weak the virtuous I can't I
[1:22:43] can't even get away from that one I'm
[1:22:44] trying to make a point so when we come
[1:22:47] to the temperance it's not stop drinking
[1:22:55] alcohol stuff like that no it means that
[1:23:00] uncontrollable temper but brother that I
[1:23:04] don't have a temper
[1:23:10] that's all right go ahead
[1:23:14] cause you see that's not going to bring
[1:23:16] a virtuous life to anyone what you claim
[1:23:19] it's what you and I live it's what we
[1:23:24] live and how we walk is going to bring
[1:23:26] the virtuous part not how much we can
[1:23:31] read or how much we can say is how much
[1:23:34] we can walk in God
[1:23:43] now watch him is he talking about a
[1:23:45] temper a very uncontrollable temper that
[1:23:49] cannot be controlled a mean person
[1:23:52] no because that ain't supposed to be in
[1:23:58] the Christian well that's what he said
[1:24:04] we'll go ahead you won't get no
[1:24:07] definition out of it taking it from the
[1:24:09] natural and it's reading that's why I
[1:24:13] spent so much time on that message on
[1:24:15] virtue trying to get you to think about
[1:24:21] well we sell streams we know what it is
[1:24:24] now we don't what the Prophet told us it
[1:24:26] was strength ain't no strength draw it
[1:24:30] out of something it's not tired if
[1:24:34] there's not a virtuous life then there's
[1:24:40] no need to try to draw anything out of
[1:24:42] it and that's where we're ever one
[1:24:44] failing we're failing on that virtuous
[1:24:51] life part we're human we're making
[1:24:59] mistakes and we do wrong we still need a
[1:25:04] Savior we still need an advocate we
[1:25:08] still need one to take care of all of
[1:25:11] our problems if a brother daily I don't
[1:25:13] have no problems I ain't had a a wrong
[1:25:17] thought since I got born again you just
[1:25:19] lied I need no backup their statements
[1:25:23] are falling away or it won't brother
[1:25:25] Dale you don't know me I know everybody
[1:25:28] like a brother told me one time he said
[1:25:30] me and my wife lived together 30
[1:25:32] something year he never had one word I
[1:25:34] said I don't believe it I said if it's
[1:25:38] true that means she's just tired down
[1:25:40] under you and she won't say nothing cuz
[1:25:44] she's afraid of you
[1:25:49] I don't care who you are you live
[1:25:52] together 30 years you're gonna have
[1:25:53] problems you live together one year
[1:25:56] you're gonna have problems right and
[1:26:01] being a yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
[1:26:04] yeah that's that's all right that's good
[1:26:06] but it ain't gonna solve the problem I'm
[1:26:14] just human all right
[1:26:17] you know that's it's the way I believe
[1:26:19] it this way live I try to live what I am
[1:26:22] and I fail and I mess up all right I
[1:26:26] know that no problem what I'm trying all
[1:26:29] right see that's the problem we need to
[1:26:33] do is just try at least you know to be
[1:26:37] what we are all right well you get what
[1:26:41] I'm talking about
[1:26:43] the emphasis E is in the statute of
[1:26:46] perfect man that there's a you know
[1:26:49] virtue he's trying to make it something
[1:26:52] else but see we move it from here to
[1:26:55] over here and we just say oh yeah we
[1:26:56] know what it is now it's strength it's
[1:27:01] not living a virgin live being this
[1:27:03] natural its strength well how did he get
[1:27:09] that strength now God living inside of
[1:27:17] him
[1:27:18] how are you gonna have any strength you
[1:27:23] see one of the profit in the way he made
[1:27:25] the statement he said the baptism of the
[1:27:27] Holy Ghost is a most important thing in
[1:27:30] your life because there's no way to have
[1:27:36] these virtues without having something
[1:27:38] to start from temperance getting over to
[1:27:50] the it for this two minute go ahead and
[1:27:54] know him
[1:27:54] number four we're brothers well that's a
[1:27:59] prophet and read it paragraph two
[1:28:01] nineteen stature perfect man you talk
[1:28:07] about to number four he gets down to the
[1:28:11] point they said add temperance oh my
[1:28:14] we've come to temperance you see we're
[1:28:20] gonna get one next see I'm trying to
[1:28:25] show you one thing your prophet has
[1:28:31] given us definitions from God of what
[1:28:34] these virtues are he's not giving us
[1:28:39] natural words that we can put together
[1:28:42] and come up with some definition of what
[1:28:45] the virtues are when we get over to
[1:28:51] godless he's gonna say he said we come
[1:28:53] all this way they ain't got to hold a
[1:28:55] ghost yet you know what that started a
[1:28:58] doctrine that is still going around the
[1:29:00] world a doctrine that there's nobody got
[1:29:04] the Holy Ghost it's still in the foreign
[1:29:08] field is still going I can get you a
[1:29:10] book on the one that wrote and supposed
[1:29:14] to be the first martyr of the age the
[1:29:18] first one kill for what he believed and
[1:29:23] that was the message no baptism of the
[1:29:26] Holy Ghost like in the book of Acts
[1:29:31] I've wished to debt for 40 years because
[1:29:34] I can read brother Brenham said the same
[1:29:37] Holy Ghost fell on deaf penico it's the
[1:29:39] same Holy Ghost living in your heart now
[1:29:42] I didn't say that he did you see but
[1:29:46] listen now we've come to temperance now
[1:29:50] you've had faith first have to have that
[1:29:52] to begin with then you had virtue to
[1:29:55] your faith if it's the right kind of
[1:29:57] virtue then you had knowledge if it's
[1:30:00] the right kind of knowledge now you're
[1:30:02] going to add temperance temperance
[1:30:05] doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol
[1:30:08] either here either
[1:30:10] no no temperance doesn't mean alcoholic
[1:30:13] cure not in this case this is Bible
[1:30:17] temperance holy ghost'
[1:30:21] holy spirit temperance that's just one
[1:30:24] of the lusts of the flesh what drinking
[1:30:26] in time right and we're talking about
[1:30:29] the holy spirit temperance
[1:30:32] now what is the holy spirit temperature
[1:30:36] that means and here is a holy spirit
[1:30:39] temperance
[1:30:40] how to control your tongue let's see we
[1:30:48] want to lay emphasis back here most of
[1:30:50] the time off of this temperance is how
[1:30:53] to control your temper he brings the
[1:30:57] word temperance as doing that how to
[1:31:01] control it but he says not to be a
[1:31:03] toddler what's the Tattler got to do
[1:31:06] with temperance you don't read what
[1:31:15] Stadler got to do with temperance
[1:31:23] you don't read you don't listen as you
[1:31:28] read your mind don't work come on he
[1:31:34] said that's just one of the lusts of the
[1:31:35] flesh
[1:31:35] well we're talking about Holy Spirit
[1:31:37] temperance that means how to control
[1:31:39] your tongue not to be a toddler how to
[1:31:45] control your temper we're getting down
[1:31:47] we're going to understand it on that
[1:31:48] right how to control your temper when
[1:31:50] he's talking about how to control your
[1:31:52] tongue that's not a definition of
[1:31:58] temperance out of Webster
[1:32:02] that's a profits definition of the word
[1:32:05] temperance not to just be a point to
[1:32:08] control your temper but to control your
[1:32:10] tongue come on you see why it's so hard
[1:32:17] to preach the truth oh it's easy to
[1:32:20] preach it a lot we eat neither one's got
[1:32:22] no Holy Ghost or devour we know it's got
[1:32:24] the Holy Ghost stronger we don't have to
[1:32:25] hold a gorilla you can preach that lie
[1:32:28] any time you want doing people agree we
[1:32:36] but the Prophet put the Holy Ghost in
[1:32:38] ever church age he didn't know no
[1:32:42] problem and he said the same Holy Ghost
[1:32:45] that fell on the day of Pentecost is the
[1:32:49] same Holy Ghost and coming into your
[1:32:50] life and see what what happened back
[1:32:56] there years ago the brother came up with
[1:32:58] a point one did that nobody's got the
[1:33:01] Holy Ghost like but because there's
[1:33:02] nobody being beyond her you know nobody
[1:33:04] went beyond the curtain of time and I
[1:33:09] said I'm sorry I'm can't happy I can
[1:33:12] read brother branham saw a lot of people
[1:33:15] beyond the curtain of time they must
[1:33:17] have had perfect love what about the 90
[1:33:23] year old woman did he saw her
[1:33:29] what about sold under the altar what
[1:33:34] about all those people
[1:33:35] they saw that's why we just get what we
[1:33:41] want we don't take the whole man and I
[1:33:43] admit the message a lot of times is hard
[1:33:45] to follow cause just what I'm talking
[1:33:48] about here he's got temperance coming up
[1:33:51] and to tell you that it's not an
[1:33:53] alcoholic cooler but he's telling you
[1:33:55] the temperance is how to control your
[1:33:59] tongue and not be a toddler then he
[1:34:02] tells you that temperance is how to
[1:34:04] control your temper not fly off every
[1:34:06] time anybody speaks across to you he's
[1:34:09] got many definitions but they're all
[1:34:12] right because we could say well bless
[1:34:21] God I don't I don't have no problem when
[1:34:24] I've got a little temper now like a
[1:34:26] little temper but the Prophet said we
[1:34:27] could have a little temper in that area
[1:34:29] no he didn't say we could have a little
[1:34:30] temper he said we had a little there's a
[1:34:33] lot of difference in it we could have a
[1:34:35] little temper and have in it B&R don't
[1:34:41] make it God giving it to you and making
[1:34:42] it work off of him that means how to
[1:34:45] control your tongue not be a toddler how
[1:34:48] to control your temperature not fly off
[1:34:49] every time anybody speaks across to you
[1:34:51] oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off
[1:34:56] before we get started
[1:34:57] aren't we then we wonder why God is not
[1:35:01] in his church doing miracles and things
[1:35:04] that he used to do yes sir
[1:35:07] add these things add temperance to it
[1:35:10] old temperance how to answering kindness
[1:35:13] when wrath is spoke to you somebody say
[1:35:16] you know watch this because this is
[1:35:18] coming up to your to your religious side
[1:35:21] of your life somebody say you bunch of
[1:35:23] holy rollers don't jump up and roll up
[1:35:27] your sleeves not that but talk with
[1:35:32] godly love temperance kindness is that
[1:35:35] the way we want to be congregation says
[1:35:37] Amen when we're out upon Ron I'm back
[1:35:40] let him be your example when they said
[1:35:44] if thou be the Son of God turn these
[1:35:45] stones into bread he could have done it
[1:35:47] and showed he was God but he
[1:35:49] temperance when he called him they
[1:35:55] called him bells above these and I'll
[1:35:56] forgive you are you listening I'll just
[1:36:01] have to stop this and pick it back up in
[1:36:03] the next message read the Statue a
[1:36:06] perfect land and read about the
[1:36:10] temperance and the vines but just
[1:36:14] remember temperance is not to stop
[1:36:17] drinking alcohol then he gives you two
[1:36:21] or three definitions of a word
[1:36:22] temperance just like he gives us two or
[1:36:26] three definitions of the word virtue and
[1:36:30] when he gets to godliness he's gonna
[1:36:31] give us a lot of definitions of wordings
[1:36:36] and he's gonna say you come all this way
[1:36:38] and they ain't got to hold it go but see
[1:36:45] you ain't listening because remember
[1:36:48] back about 20 message years ago we
[1:36:52] covered the baptism of the Holy Ghost as
[1:36:56] the new birth and how that it was Christ
[1:37:01] living in you and how that you could
[1:37:05] have the baptism every day you'll often
[1:37:07] miss it because that's on your spirit
[1:37:11] we've covered those things and we
[1:37:14] covered true that there's a difference
[1:37:17] between the born-again experience and
[1:37:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've done
[1:37:25] covered that so you're gonna lose it
[1:37:27] when I get up and start making that
[1:37:29] statement that your prophet has made
[1:37:31] you're going to lose because you're
[1:37:35] gonna say now wait a minute how can you
[1:37:36] how the new birth in the back came out
[1:37:38] the back it's all one in the same you
[1:37:41] ain't listening to him there's one the
[1:37:44] troubles that you still have your own
[1:37:48] definitions of words I'm trying my best
[1:37:51] to get one thing to us we need to get
[1:37:55] rid of our education that's as plain as
[1:37:58] I can say we need to get rid of our
[1:38:01] education
[1:38:05] he said no no no we don't need to become
[1:38:08] dummies getting rid of your education
[1:38:11] eight dummies couldn't read the
[1:38:13] education is a right thing because your
[1:38:16] education is what making them your dummy
[1:38:19] right education is what's making you a
[1:38:23] dummy let's get rid of the educational
[1:38:26] part and we'll see that a lot of
[1:38:30] definitions of words don't mean what
[1:38:32] they mean come on what do you listen
[1:38:42] virtue doesn't mean a virgin life don't
[1:38:48] forget what it means from there it means
[1:38:51] strength he went off the scale on both
[1:38:58] ends and you're saying what the prophets
[1:39:05] say what you running it off on both in
[1:39:07] come back in the middle and think a
[1:39:11] little bit about a virtuous life in
[1:39:14] Christ of letting him live into our
[1:39:19] hearts and lives human mistakes yes
[1:39:23] problems yes we're going to be that away
[1:39:26] all of us are going to be that away I
[1:39:29] don't care who you think you are or what
[1:39:32] you think I am we're all got that
[1:39:34] problem we're human but we need to get
[1:39:40] rid of ourselves and let Christ feel
[1:39:45] because that's the Christian life Father
[1:39:49] we thank you and we ask you to just be
[1:39:50] with us as we Lord come to a close we
[1:39:53] know that we can't continue the thought
[1:39:55] we talk too much time so we commit it to
[1:39:58] you we'll finish this later you'll bring
[1:40:00] it back we'll all be in you and whatever
[1:40:03] to be and we commit it to you now in
[1:40:04] Jesus name come on musicians this sing
[1:40:09] if anybody hasn't need the altars open
[1:40:14] all I'm trying to do is get us to look
[1:40:17] at a human as human beings we have human
[1:40:20] traits and those traits and things is
[1:40:23] our problem
[1:40:26] that's our problems that's our troubles
[1:40:29] and then we look at each other to try to
[1:40:33] find out about the other person you know
[1:40:36] instead of looking at our own sales and
[1:40:40] saying lord help me help me Lord just be
[1:40:45] what you want me to be but takes one
[1:40:48] thing for certain I hope you'll remember
[1:40:50] that you'll take that first two or three
[1:40:53] quotes that we read that you'll take
[1:40:56] them home and think about the church
[1:40:59] that has these virtues as going in the
[1:41:01] rapture the church that has these
[1:41:06] virtues the individuals who have these
[1:41:08] virtues is going in the rapture the
[1:41:11] individuals that has these virtues
[1:41:12] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:41:17] because God said it he's promised it but
[1:41:24] they're not going to be there without
[1:41:26] these virtues because they're required
[1:41:29] if he's given us the ability to receive
[1:41:32] something - to make it to come to an end
[1:41:34] then he will also condemn us with the
[1:41:38] same point since I've told you I told
[1:41:45] you you didn't listen well you just you
[1:41:49] just make things to where I can't
[1:41:50] understand you I thought I could
