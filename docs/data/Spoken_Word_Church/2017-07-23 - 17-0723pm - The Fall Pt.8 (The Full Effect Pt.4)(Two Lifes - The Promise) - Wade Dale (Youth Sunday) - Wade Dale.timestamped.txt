[18:54] talk about somebody's real special we're
[18:56] gonna talk about the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:57] and man let's turn it in the Bible to
[19:00] the book of Genesis and it looks like me
[19:03] and brother Dale can't get out of the
[19:04] book of Genesis but that's ok it's
[19:07] alright it's where everything began so
[19:11] we're going to be genesis 3:15
[19:14] today we're still talking about the fall
[19:16] the full effects of the fall to life and
[19:21] now we're going to talk about the
[19:22] promise because last week we kind of hit
[19:24] the at the end we talked about the
[19:25] promise there is a promise and the Bible
[19:30] says that
[19:32] God could swear by no other so he swore
[19:36] by himself he's going to do it we can't
[19:40] do it the devil can't do it the Angels
[19:43] can't do it but God is going to do it
[19:46] himself but he's going to do it through
[19:48] a group of people man he's not going to
[19:51] do it he is going to do it by yourself
[19:52] he's going to make sure this plan is
[19:54] carried out but he's going to carry it
[19:56] out through the bride of Jesus Christ
[19:58] hey man so we do have something to do
[20:00] with this man so let's bow our heads
[20:02] before we get started or Jesus we pray
[20:05] today Lord that you would come among us
[20:07] in a special way today you'd be the one
[20:10] Lord that does the speaking the
[20:13] revealing you'd be the one that today is
[20:17] our satisfying portion or that all
[20:20] things that are hindering us in our body
[20:23] and hindrance in our mind and hindering
[20:25] us in our work and all the things of
[20:27] life that we'll just lay it aside for a
[20:28] few minutes Lord and you speak to all of
[20:31] us Lord not just one person speak to
[20:33] everyone in the congregation thank you
[20:35] for bringing sister Bayo back with us
[20:37] Lord would sure appreciate that thank
[20:39] you very much special lady in our heart
[20:42] I pray that you'd bless her Lord give us
[20:45] strength just touch each one of us -
[20:47] Lord all of us are special in here we
[20:48] all are special people because we come I
[20:51] believe
[20:52] we come from you and that makes us real
[20:55] special Lord I pray that you'd be with
[20:58] us take care of us be with the
[20:59] missionaries Lord as they all are now
[21:01] preparing to - some still in the foreign
[21:05] field and some getting ready to come
[21:06] home here to be with the camp-meeting
[21:08] Lord just give them strength give them
[21:10] traveling mercy father we pray that you
[21:12] just be with the ones that are not with
[21:14] us today Lord take care of them it was a
[21:16] little bride all around the world father
[21:18] because we are truly the apple of your
[21:20] eye Lord we pray that you'd be with us
[21:22] and touch us now and cheese's name we
[21:24] pray amen genesis 3:15 now this is this
[21:27] is after the fall of what happened in
[21:31] the Garden of Eden between Adam and Eve
[21:33] and the Beast and this is what God is
[21:36] saying to Adam and Eve but what he's
[21:42] doing is he says to me
[21:45] is ringing out to Eternity because this
[21:49] is the eternal Word of God and this I in
[21:52] this scripture is God Almighty Himself
[21:55] not a prophet not a priest not a king
[21:57] this is God himself so that's what he
[22:00] says and I will put enmity between thee
[22:04] and the woman and between thy seed and
[22:06] her seed now remember the promise is
[22:09] when we'll talk about in just a second a
[22:11] woman doesn't have a seat a man woman
[22:15] has to receive seed right the man has to
[22:17] seed so the woman's seed speaking of
[22:20] Jesus Christ that God would come in
[22:22] human flesh through the womb of a woman
[22:24] be given a seed by God and the sperm and
[22:28] the egg and produced the body of Jesus
[22:31] Christ a man and then what's that person
[22:33] going to do he's going to what he's
[22:34] going to wrap everything up bring it
[22:36] right back that's the promise all right
[22:38] I'll put enmity between the end woman
[22:40] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[22:41] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[22:43] his heel now let's read acts 2:38 before
[22:46] we before we sit down because here is
[22:49] your promise then Peter said unto them
[22:54] repent not quit doing this don't do this
[22:57] don't do that repent repent and be
[23:01] baptized every one of you in the name of
[23:03] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[23:06] and you shall receive the gift of the
[23:08] Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you
[23:11] and to your children and to all that are
[23:15] afar off even as many as the Lord our
[23:18] God shall call you may be seated in the
[23:21] Lord as blessing to the reading of the
[23:22] word now let's read Galatians 2:20
[23:24] because we're talking about for you
[23:26] haven't been here the background a
[23:28] little bit on two lights now not two
[23:31] lives we're talking about two life's
[23:34] okay like brother Dale this morning
[23:36] bringing in two creations alright we're
[23:39] looking at two lights because what did
[23:40] Paul say he said I am crucified with
[23:42] Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but
[23:46] Christ liveth in me and the life which I
[23:50] now live which means he lived a previous
[23:54] life before that what
[23:58] y'all in Sunday school this morning
[24:00] thank you thank you
[24:04] well I told y'all in sun-tzu class what
[24:07] to do when we had booster and the life
[24:09] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[24:13] the faith of myself oh no that's not
[24:17] what he said he said I live by the faith
[24:20] of the Son of God who loved me and gave
[24:23] himself for me Paul saying look it's
[24:25] nothing I've done it's nothing that is
[24:27] not me it's not I live he's already said
[24:30] that it's not islet live but Christ that
[24:32] liveth in me and the life I now live in
[24:36] other words I live the previous life
[24:39] contrary to the way I live now and then
[24:43] because as Christians we believe I
[24:45] believe one thing's for sure you have to
[24:49] have something new your old birth your
[24:54] old life is cankered
[24:56] nasty filthy dead and on its way to hell
[25:02] if you don't have the life of Christ
[25:05] inside of you then that's exactly where
[25:07] you're going there's no gray area
[25:10] there's no I'm a halfway Christian or
[25:12] I've got half of God in me or I've got
[25:13] some of God in me you either got all God
[25:16] or no God I believe in what saved always
[25:24] say but I believe once saved by the
[25:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost you're always
[25:27] saved
[25:28] don't tell me you act like a devil all
[25:30] your life and then you gonna go to
[25:31] heaven
[25:31] I got quite loose were you thank you man
[25:44] that says truth but look the life which
[25:48] I now live I saw I saw my two lives we
[25:51] have one life that listen whatever you
[25:54] believe happened in the Garden of Eden
[25:56] there was a covenant that was before
[26:00] that God said if you eat of this this is
[26:03] what's going to happen right if you
[26:06] don't eat of this this is what's going
[26:08] to happen right then when what they did
[26:11] was is they broke that covenant he knew
[26:14] he knew man was going to break the
[26:15] Covenant Adam and he broke that covenant
[26:18] and now God had to bring another
[26:21] covenant in and but the Covenant came
[26:24] with a promise genesis 3:15 i will put
[26:29] enmity or in other words i'm going to
[26:31] put a division it's like I said before
[26:33] listen Adam didn't lose his relationship
[26:37] he was a son of God the Bible says he
[26:41] was a son of God amen he didn't lose his
[26:44] relationship I'm related to Samuel and
[26:47] Peggy Dale and I can't ever lose that
[26:50] but I lost my fellowship with God when I
[26:55] decided to go another direction we were
[26:59] talking about that back there a few
[27:00] minutes ago I decided to go another way
[27:05] in other words you can bring them a kid
[27:07] up in the way it should go absolutely
[27:09] and when it's older it'll come back but
[27:11] there is a time when I lived a different
[27:14] life I lived a life that that I knew
[27:19] that their God was nowhere to be seen
[27:22] that I that I decided that's the way I
[27:26] was going to live amen
[27:29] now listen we know God was with us we
[27:31] know that we know we had an angel with
[27:33] us we know we had something with us that
[27:35] helped us but I promise you one thing
[27:38] you're still a free moral agent that
[27:41] angel cannot influence you so much but
[27:45] so much you're a free moral agent
[27:47] because you can override that Eve
[27:49] overrode what God said hey man and did
[27:54] what she did all right
[27:55] but thou
[27:55] as we see that that fall coming in and
[27:59] we'll read it in just a minute that
[28:02] there had to be another life that we
[28:04] have to look for the first life light
[28:09] with even with Abel and Cain you look at
[28:12] Abel and Cain
[28:12] they made a sacrifice they had to have a
[28:15] sacrifice in other in other words they
[28:19] had to have a different life than just
[28:23] normal people same today today we have
[28:29] two life amen
[28:32] and I can say like Paul denai the life
[28:35] that I now live I didn't listen you know
[28:38] what I live by my own faith I live by my
[28:41] own rules
[28:42] before God came into my life hey man so
[28:50] I said before let's just break this
[28:52] thing down real good I was not born with
[28:57] any kind of eternal quality in this life
[29:02] show me one
[29:04] except that God before the foundation of
[29:07] the world saw that I would one day he
[29:12] would cross my path and that I would
[29:14] accept what he had now you didn't know
[29:18] that but he did he's all-knowing he knew
[29:22] that we crossed your path but he also
[29:24] knew that when he crossed the neighbors
[29:26] path they would reject him amen
[29:29] because remember we don't believe in
[29:31] predestination as that God had put you
[29:33] into a tube and he's going to pull you
[29:35] through that tube and that's the way
[29:36] it's going to be no listen that's not
[29:39] even a just God to do that all we are
[29:44] would be just Christian zombies pretty
[29:47] much least we'd be Christian zombies
[29:50] okay Lord what do I do
[29:53] no no no we have a free moral agency to
[29:58] do right or wrong even today a man
[30:04] period so predestination is easy
[30:09] if you got a person that knew what was
[30:11] going to happen before it happened now
[30:14] if you just got predestination of
[30:16] somebody that doesn't know anything
[30:17] until it happens
[30:19] you got a problem but when you've got a
[30:22] man called God because the season says
[30:24] those who lay what for knew he did
[30:28] predestinate a man so foreknowledge was
[30:32] first he knew before every person
[30:35] listened before the world was ever
[30:38] formed he knew you'd be sitting here
[30:39] today
[30:41] in fact if not then he's not my god if
[30:46] he didn't know whatever thought you're
[30:48] having at the moment he's not God he is
[30:54] in finite we are finite your thoughts
[31:01] remember a louder in heaven why because
[31:03] that's where they're at that all right
[31:08] but we had a promise because remember
[31:11] once we got across that chasm because if
[31:14] you look at the type in the Old
[31:16] Testament look in the Book of Luke I
[31:17] believe it is where you've got the rich
[31:20] young ruler dies and then you got
[31:22] Lazarus that dies and the rich young
[31:26] ruler is trying to get word where
[31:28] Lazarus is out and Lazarus is laying
[31:30] over there under a shade tree in the
[31:32] bosom of Abraham enjoying itself and
[31:34] he's over here the rich young ruler died
[31:37] he's in hell he's wanting a cup of water
[31:39] he's willing just some water on his
[31:41] fingertip and he asked Lazarus and
[31:46] Lazarus is look I can't go where you are
[31:48] and you can't go where I go why there
[31:50] was a great gulf the Bible said there
[31:53] was a division that what you know what
[31:56] separated their choice their choice on
[32:00] earth separated where they were at that
[32:02] moment nothing else but their choice
[32:06] because remember Jesus Christ died he
[32:09] came to this earth and died for every
[32:11] person on the face of this earth amen
[32:14] but he only but he knew who would accept
[32:18] him and who would not
[32:19] he did not just come down here and say
[32:22] well maybe somebody will feel sorry for
[32:24] me they'll make a movie about me called
[32:26] The Passion of the Christ and somebody
[32:28] might just get saved no that's not the
[32:30] way God works if he is all-knowing if he
[32:34] knew what your thought was going to be
[32:35] today before the foundation of the world
[32:37] absolutely he'll know what your
[32:39] beginning and your end is going to be
[32:40] amen
[32:42] that makes him in phonate we are finite
[32:46] you know I can see why God knew who all
[32:48] these kids were if you were infinite
[32:50] you'd know how many kids use going on
[32:52] because he's building this family if
[32:56] Genesis 1:26 man that we're talking
[32:58] about listen that's the pure family of
[33:00] God that we've been talking about and
[33:03] you can't have that old life and be in
[33:07] that family because remember your family
[33:10] traits go with you amen if you have
[33:15] those original traits of line and
[33:18] cheating and stealing and running around
[33:19] and drinking and smoking and cutting we
[33:22] can make a list listen the list is not a
[33:26] problem right the list is not the
[33:30] problem you know that's what we do I
[33:32] just read you that scripture where Peter
[33:33] said unto them repent the first thing we
[33:35] do is don't do this don't do that and
[33:37] only this but what we do is though we
[33:39] look at the characteristics or the
[33:41] attributes of that life and the
[33:44] attributes and characteristics
[33:45] characteristics of that life is that we
[33:47] were lost why because we were
[33:50] unbelievers we did not believe that God
[33:55] could save you and you really didn't
[33:59] care at the time please people please
[34:01] you say no I love God from birth well
[34:04] that's good but if you're not born again
[34:06] you're as dead as Adolf Hitler hello
[34:10] somebody that old life got to be not
[34:17] just divorced or not just hid under a
[34:19] bush or kicked in a closet no it's got
[34:23] to be annihilated and there's only one
[34:26] way for it to be annihilated and that's
[34:27] by the blood of Jesus Christ no man
[34:31] and blood could do it why because there
[34:33] was no life in that blood that could
[34:34] come back into me and you mmm
[34:36] so that what we've been talking about
[34:37] the two lifes and let's talk about the
[34:39] promise now let's go to John 14:16 let's
[34:43] just see for a minute
[34:44] since we backed up we're going to read
[34:46] this again everybody all right say ma'am
[34:50] and I will pray the father and he shall
[34:54] give you another comforter that he may
[34:57] abide with you forever even the spirit
[35:01] of some time truth owed I read that

[36:28] Bible I see I look at my brothers the
[36:31] sisters with the born-again experience I
[36:32] see I look in the mirror
[36:41] I look in the mirror and if I'm born
[36:45] again I see Jesus Christ right and I
[36:50] don't make me nothing right because I
[36:53] also look in there and I see some of
[36:55] that other life sniffling they're called
[36:56] the devil because I came from my mama my
[36:58] daddy and I have these characteristics
[37:01] that I have to try to get rid of right
[37:05] okay
[37:08] yellow a wild I love this scripture
[37:10] because look at that promise this world
[37:13] will not see me they'll see me no more
[37:17] but you'll see me
[37:19] you'll see me because I live you shall
[37:23] live also at that day now listen I tell
[37:28] them tell them back there in the back
[37:30] listen at that day look how look how
[37:34] that you say well that was a John wrote
[37:37] that and and Jesus spoke that and he's
[37:40] talking about his day no wait a minute
[37:42] at that moment they didn't know any of
[37:45] that at that moment they didn't know any
[37:50] of that even the disciples didn't know
[37:54] that but at this day the day of this
[37:58] revelation you shall know not just maybe
[38:02] or have a mental conception or what the
[38:06] Baptist said or what the Methodist said
[38:08] or what the Pentecostal said or what the
[38:10] brand of mine said at that day you
[38:13] shouting at you one person you got
[38:16] talking to you today not another group
[38:18] he's talking to you and that day you
[38:20] shall know that I am in my father I am
[38:30] in my father hello man wait a minute
[38:36] and ye and me and I in you and we all
[38:41] right there now to us that's free
[38:48] the god that's one man goes Jesus what
[38:54] he said I my father - you have to be
[38:59] careful when I'm reaching him I'm always
[39:03] in one and that day Jesus said I my
[39:07] father one if you've seen me you've seen
[39:11] the father so now that I am in my father
[39:14] and ye and me and I knew how in the
[39:19] world can you ever be defeated
[39:23] you got an eternal eternal eternal when
[39:29] I watch he keeps going in John 14:26 he
[39:31] says but the comforter now you talked
[39:33] about I will not leave you comfortless
[39:34] I'll send another comforter now who is
[39:36] it but the comforter which is the Holy
[39:39] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[39:43] name so watch the name of the Holy Ghost
[39:45] Jesus crying what's the name of the
[39:47] father Jesus Christ we don't believe in
[39:54] a Trinity I promise you that now we
[39:58] believe in offices because remember he
[40:03] was in a dispensation of the father and
[40:05] the Old Testament we read it in just a
[40:06] minute because we got to get to that I
[40:07] kind of got ahead of myself then we had
[40:09] a dispensation of him to being down here
[40:11] then we have a dispensation of him being
[40:14] what you're not going to see me any more
[40:16] but I'll be with you even in you what in
[40:19] the Holy Spirit in a spirit form I'll be
[40:22] with you even in you till the end of the
[40:24] world or the end of the age all right
[40:26] but the comforter which is the Holy
[40:28] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[40:31] name he shall teach you all things and
[40:35] bring all things to your remembrance
[40:37] whatsoever I have said unto you a man
[40:41] what a promise now what we know one
[40:50] thing's for sure we covered it last
[40:52] Sunday no one just kind of covered again
[40:53] in the Old Testament though when you
[40:58] come to the genesis 3:15
[41:02] you see that God made a promise but
[41:06] because of sin he couldn't fulfill that
[41:09] promise
[41:09] at that moment members they lost
[41:13] fellowship there was an enmity enmity
[41:16] means a division in but the enmity means
[41:18] something very harsh so God put enmity
[41:21] he couldn't come down in the cool today
[41:23] and talk to Adam he couldn't he couldn't
[41:25] come up to Abel and say Abel I'm going
[41:28] to give you of my life can do that he
[41:33] borrowed itself remember remember that
[41:36] cherubims was around the tree of life so
[41:39] they couldn't get back to him now who's
[41:40] the Tree of Life
[41:41] Jesus Christ eternal life the Tree of
[41:44] Life was eternal life and God put a
[41:47] hedge around it that they couldn't get
[41:48] to it so in your Old Testament because
[41:52] of what happened in the animal kingdom
[41:54] God used the animals for sacrifice and
[41:57] it was allowed this is elementary but
[42:02] we're going to get we're going to get to
[42:03] somewhere in a minute but he used the
[42:06] animals and the blood of bulls and goats
[42:08] and Hebrews 9 6 let's go to that one now
[42:15] when these things were thus ordained the
[42:18] priest went always into the first
[42:19] article accomplishing the service of God
[42:22] but into the second went to high priest
[42:25] alone once every year not without blood
[42:30] which he offered for himself and for the
[42:32] errors of the people the Holy Ghost this
[42:35] signifying now watch the Holy Ghost
[42:38] signifying that the way into the holiest
[42:41] of all was not yet made manifest you see
[42:45] that the Holy Ghost signifying that the
[42:48] way who's the way Jesus Christ is the
[42:51] way the truth and the life
[42:54] and then remember I told you about last
[42:57] Sunday and I was going to bring up and I
[42:58] may bring you next Sunday where brother
[43:00] Branham said and it to me it just lines
[43:02] everything right up he said Jesus did
[43:04] not bring you in inheritance the
[43:09] inheritance always was either that or
[43:12] Jesus had to make something when he was
[43:14] down here
[43:15] no your inheritance was the that Genesis
[43:18] 1:26 man the brunette was talking about
[43:20] the promise that that was not even
[43:24] created it just became into a form where
[43:28] you could see it amen
[43:31] but what did he come to do he came to
[43:33] make what away back to your inheritance
[43:39] because remember the the fellowship we
[43:42] got to come back into fellowship with
[43:44] God the only way to come back into
[43:46] fellowship with God is to do what by the
[43:49] blood that High Priest if he walk behind
[43:52] that veil without that blood of that
[43:55] lamb he died under bulls and goats he
[44:02] died because he did what he did not do
[44:05] what God told him to do but once the
[44:08] high priest did everything got
[44:09] everything together got the word right
[44:12] got the right revelation he took that
[44:16] blood and he walked back in there and he
[44:18] give it for him and for the people but
[44:22] remember he had to do that every year
[44:26] over and over and over again
[44:32] the Holy Ghost is signifying that the
[44:34] way into the holiest of all was not yet
[44:36] made manifest because see we can go into
[44:39] the Holy of Holies now by the new birth
[44:42] we are in the Holy of Holies amen
[44:45] they couldn't you couldn't just walk
[44:47] back in there remember who was it
[44:49] somebody sons went back in there died
[44:52] right Aaron's sons I believe it was now
[44:56] they were in line to be high priests but
[44:58] they didn't do it right
[44:59] it's like our life we think well I lays
[45:02] a piece of my life to just say it right
[45:04] well you bury it you better get taken
[45:05] care of and as the Holy Ghost this thing
[45:09] finds a way into the holiest of Holies
[45:10] was not yet made Memphis while the first
[45:12] time and uncle was just standing which
[45:14] you were talking with the Old Testament
[45:15] which was a figure for the time all
[45:18] right remember that phrase at that day
[45:22] when Jesus came that day was over with
[45:26] when Jesus came on our
[45:28] gave his life the tabernacle or the old
[45:31] temple in the old testament was done
[45:33] away with now they didn't know that they
[45:36] kept so what they kept so enough they
[45:38] kept sewing the curtain by God they
[45:42] should have known well no I guess they
[45:44] should they should have known if that
[45:46] thing was ripped from the top to the
[45:47] bottom that it wasn't a man that did it
[45:50] because it's pretty easy to stand down
[45:52] here and rip but to rip it from 40 feet
[45:55] high believe it was certainly something
[45:56] feet high that curtain got ripped from
[45:58] top to bottom they ought to know God did
[46:01] that which was a figure for the time
[46:04] then present in which were offered both
[46:08] gifts and sacrifices that could not him
[46:11] make him that did the service perfect as
[46:14] pertaining to the conscious that's you
[46:19] and then explanation of that the blood
[46:25] of bulls and goats only covered your sin
[46:28] if you had sinned that blood would cover
[46:31] that sin but remember that sin was still
[46:33] right there and then the next year guess
[46:36] what had to happen you carried that sin
[46:38] all the way through the year the high
[46:39] priests had to go right back into the
[46:40] same tabernacle and make another
[46:43] offering sin was still there right right
[46:47] so let's see what happens after that
[46:49] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[46:51] divers washings and carnal ordinances
[46:53] imposed on them that until the time of
[46:56] reformation but cry but Christ's coming
[46:59] as and high priests of good things to
[47:02] come by a greater and more perfect
[47:04] Tabernacle not made with hands dare to
[47:08] say not of this building what was he
[47:10] talking about his body neither by the
[47:14] blood of goats and calves but by his own
[47:16] blood he entered once into the holy
[47:19] place having obtained eternal redemption
[47:22] for us for if the blood of bulls and
[47:26] goats and the ashes of a heifer
[47:27] sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the
[47:30] purifying of the flesh how much more
[47:32] shall the blood of Christ who through
[47:34] the Eternal Spirit comes remember the
[47:36] blood it was in those animals sister Val
[47:38] that wasn't an eternal bond that was an
[47:41] eternal spirit
[47:44] that was animal blood right it just
[47:47] covered but the blood of a man that had
[47:53] eternal life he didn't just cover it he
[47:58] sent it back and there's nothing under
[48:01] there anymore hey man what a mighty God
[48:05] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[48:08] ensues you said you sitting here today
[48:10] so I can't live this as your exact
[48:12] recruit you can't live it you try and
[48:18] see you'll fail every time but Paul got
[48:24] revelation he said it's not either
[48:25] liveth but Christ that liveth in me he
[48:28] he asked Christ to come into his life
[48:32] and live it for him amen how much more
[48:36] shall the blood of Christ who through
[48:38] the Eternal Spirit see blood of bulls
[48:40] and goats don't have eternal spirit
[48:42] Christ had an eternal spirit thank God
[48:45] that was that Genesis 1:26 men that
[48:49] eternal spirit offered himself without
[48:50] spot to God purge your conscience from
[48:53] dead works to serve the Living God
[48:55] that's the question and for this cause
[48:58] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[49:00] that by means of death for the
[49:03] redemption of the transgressions that
[49:05] were under the first Testament remember
[49:07] the Old Testament there was a Testament
[49:10] bulls and goats something had to die and
[49:14] it didn't do away with your life because
[49:16] remember those people would just keep on
[49:18] sinning it had nothing to do with taking
[49:21] that old life out and putting a new life
[49:25] in God was just covering their life
[49:29] until he died at Calvary and then I'm
[49:32] telling you that's why that nobody had a
[49:35] new birth in their soul in the Old
[49:36] Testament there was not there was no
[49:39] life of an animal that could burn that
[49:42] old nature out of you
[49:44] no but there was a man came that's the
[49:49] promise that's the woman's seeds it had
[49:51] to be the woman's seed come that they
[49:54] which are called might receive
[49:56] the promise of eternal inheritance for
[50:00] where a testament is there must also of
[50:03] necessity be the death of the testator
[50:06] for a testament is of force after men
[50:10] are dead listen unless you're just real
[50:14] goofy they don't read your will while
[50:17] you're still alive they read your will
[50:20] when you're dead because that Testament
[50:24] is not enforced that will is not
[50:26] enforced until the person is dead right
[50:29] amen
[50:30] I mean you know we got all these living
[50:32] wills and all this stuff but I'm talking
[50:33] about usually when you go in a lawyer's
[50:36] office and sit down the deceased is not
[50:38] in the room and when they read the will
[50:41] it's something that he or she has given
[50:44] you upon death Christ had to die and
[50:50] upon death he brought in a New Testament
[50:53] man which was not it was the Old
[50:56] Testament done away but a New Testament
[50:59] was in what hang on a minute he'll tell
[51:03] you what it is for a testament is the
[51:04] force after men are dead otherwise it is
[51:06] no strength at all while the testator
[51:09] liveth that's why the New Testament only
[51:12] began in the book of Acts Matthew Mark
[51:16] Luke and John is not the beginning of
[51:17] the New Testament the testator was still
[51:20] alive Bible says that while he's still
[51:24] alive it has no strength they were still
[51:28] under the law when Christ was here but
[51:31] when Christ died let's go to the next
[51:33] let's go the next scripture this is the
[51:36] communion Scripture he took the cup and
[51:39] gave thanks and gave it to them saying
[51:40] drink ye all of it for this is my blood
[51:43] of the New Testament which is shed for
[51:46] many for the remission of sins now what
[51:48] he's doing he's telling them that the
[51:50] next day he's going to die and his blood
[51:52] is going to what be spilled on the earth
[51:54] and the life that was in that blood is
[51:57] going to come back for a new Testament
[51:59] because the Old Testament couldn't do
[52:01] away with your old life it had no
[52:05] strength because the testator was still
[52:07] life
[52:08] but when he died when Christ died his
[52:12] blood was of the New Testament that now
[52:15] it doesn't just do away with your sin it
[52:18] covers your sins not just coverage your
[52:21] sin it does away with it and then it
[52:24] does away with your sin your be happy
[52:28] 3 you say I used to do this and I used
[52:33] to do that and I used to do this not
[52:35] used to do that yeah you still remember
[52:36] you know what God doesn't God doesn't
[52:39] remember it and that Old Testament sin
[52:42] people even the high priest you know
[52:44] they had to write things down there was
[52:47] always a remembrance the Bible said
[52:49] there was a remembrance every year they
[52:52] were something written down nothing
[52:55] going nothing going what sins are you
[52:59] talking about in their song it's the
[53:02] Mayo write a good song about that what
[53:05] sins are you talking about all right
[53:09] look now let's go to Hebrews 11 and
[53:10] let's put a little punctuation mark on
[53:12] this Hebrews 11 37 they were stoned they
[53:15] were sawn asunder they were tempted now
[53:17] this is Hebrews 11 is to faith chapter
[53:20] of the Bible by faith able by faith
[53:23] Abraham by faith Jacob by faith Moses by
[53:27] faith Enoch by faith help me somebody of
[53:30] Sarah by faith and he just runs through
[53:33] the whole list and that's all in the Old
[53:35] Testament right by faith they did this
[53:39] they were stoned they were sawn asunder
[53:41] Isaiah was cut in pieces he was a young
[53:45] man Isaiah that wrote I was in the Bible
[53:47] he was a young man he was a priest and
[53:48] they killed him and they actually hacked
[53:50] him into they cut him they saw him
[53:52] asunder Paul knew this right in the book
[53:54] of Hebrew we're tempted were slain with
[53:57] the sword they wandered about in
[53:59] sheepskins and goatskins being destitute
[54:01] afflicted tormented and you know what if
[54:04] we wrote a commentary about it they were
[54:06] defeated right they would look like they
[54:10] were a defeated bunch of people paul
[54:12] says of whom the world was not even
[54:14] worthy the world was not even worthy to
[54:17] them for them to even walk on the earth
[54:20] they wandered in deserts
[54:22] in mountains and in dens and caves of
[54:24] the earth and these all having obtained
[54:27] a good report through faith received not
[54:30] the promise none of them had a new birth
[54:35] in their soul they had their old life
[54:38] and by faith though a good report
[54:42] through faith they believed God I ever
[54:46] have believed God and it was what
[54:48] imputed to him for righteousness
[54:51] now Abraham wanted a very righteous guy
[54:56] give his wife away twice laughed at God
[55:00] said oh my Ishmael walk before you but
[55:06] when you look back to the blood
[55:07] Paul said strong in faith never stagger
[55:12] that's a prophecy God and we think these
[55:15] little frivolous things that we we think
[55:17] is hindering us please if you put them
[55:21] under the blood got on even see him I
[55:23] telling you those days by life telling
[55:24] him I telling the other day I was
[55:25] praying I said God I just really I'm
[55:28] sorry I did I actually I must have went
[55:30] by a place or something brought to my
[55:32] memory something that I did that was
[55:33] wrong and I said God I'm sorry forgive
[55:36] me of that little boy spoke said please
[55:38] oh my what are you talking about what
[55:42] sins are you talking about and these all
[55:46] having obtained a good report through
[55:47] faith received not the promise God
[55:50] having provided some better Jesus Christ
[55:54] for us is that all right you say that's
[55:58] this thing you know that the Bible calls
[56:01] the Holy Ghost of thing yeah so you know
[56:03] be careful but that's okay for us that
[56:07] they without us should not be made
[56:12] perfect amen that all right now watch
[56:15] here's another scripture that then I
[56:18] came upon first John 2:25 watch this I I
[56:21] really hadn't read this before but I
[56:23] love the little John's I just got
[56:24] finished reading them how many times
[56:27] have you read through the Bible and you
[56:28] reads book of John and you go I didn't
[56:31] read that
[56:32] first John 2:25 and this is to promise
[56:36] that he has promised us even eternal
[56:38] life boy you can put just put a
[56:42] punctuation mark on that that is the
[56:44] promise eternal life with the Creator
[56:50] amen let's read this conferences number
[56:57] one I can imagine God our Father down
[57:00] the Garden of Eden looking around to
[57:03] find a certain tree to where he could
[57:05] call his children up in his presence
[57:06] under this tree he selected the place
[57:09] and he called that conference and he
[57:13] stood at him and even the Serpent and
[57:15] there was a conference hell they had
[57:18] trespassed his laws and his laws were
[57:21] just and must the penalty must be paid
[57:24] and how are they going to live after the
[57:28] death sentence hangs on them because
[57:30] remember he said the day you eat thereof
[57:32] that day you're done right the first
[57:34] covenant that God said he said the day
[57:36] you eat thereof he said that day you'll
[57:37] die all right and how are they going to
[57:41] live after the death sentence hangs on
[57:43] them and there was a conference held and
[57:46] there was a perpetuation made for that
[57:50] sin brother Dale covered to this morning
[57:54] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[57:56] world okay and temporarily look
[57:59] temporarily until the woman seed was to
[58:04] bruise the Serpent's head that would pay
[58:07] the full penalty of sin there was a lamb
[58:10] sacrificed
[58:11] until that time to be fulfilled and
[58:14] there was something that was achieved
[58:17] there was something done that was great
[58:20] a way that man could be saved again hey
[58:24] man before the foundation of the world
[58:27] because watch Hebrews 10 let's continue
[58:31] reading now for the law having a shadow
[58:35] of good things to come and not the very
[58:37] image of the thing can never with those
[58:39] sacrifices would they offer year by year
[58:42] continually make the comers air into
[58:44] perfect
[58:46] by any Old Testament received the
[58:47] promise age they weren't perfect now
[58:49] look God looking through the eyes of
[58:51] truth I'm sorry through the blood they
[58:54] were they were covered for the moment
[58:56] all right but for then would they not
[59:00] have ceased to be offered he's asking a
[59:03] question question mark because that the
[59:05] worshiper once purged should have no
[59:07] more conscience of sin that's what God's
[59:10] wanting but in those sacrifices there is
[59:13] a remembrance again made of sins every
[59:16] year remember I said I wrote him down
[59:18] for it is not possible that the blood of
[59:21] bulls and of goats should take away sin
[59:25] so it couldn't take away sin it only
[59:28] covered sin amen
[59:31] now let's go down to 9 just ask it for
[59:34] time and then said i lo I come to do thy
[59:36] will o God he taketh away the first that
[59:40] he may establish the second what he done
[59:42] was he took those cherubims that were
[59:45] around the tree of life and he broke
[59:46] them back
[59:47] he opened the seal he took the seal off
[59:51] of that tree amen and he says I am the
[59:56] way the truth and the life
[59:58] I'm not just away on the tree how can
[1:00:01] you lose when you walk into a end of the
[1:00:04] court as brother Branham would always
[1:00:06] say you walk into the court and you've
[1:00:07] been convicted of something so there
[1:00:09] says Jesus is the prosecutor there says
[1:00:11] Jesus is the defense attorney there says
[1:00:14] Jesus is a judge and they all go what we
[1:00:17] doing here what seems like you humped
[1:00:21] what this man do but he took away the
[1:00:24] first at him in established the second
[1:00:27] he takes away your first life so that he
[1:00:31] can establish your second life and then
[1:00:34] he takes away all that old and all
[1:00:37] things become new by which we are
[1:00:41] sanctified through the offering of the
[1:00:44] body of Jesus Christ once for all it
[1:00:46] does not have listen we put him on the
[1:00:48] cross all time we put him back on the
[1:00:51] cross all the time can you die I've
[1:00:54] already died can you I've already died
[1:00:56] can you I've already
[1:01:00] listen people we have got to realize
[1:01:06] that this thing was over before it
[1:01:08] started but we've got to prove it down
[1:01:12] here like we were talking in the back
[1:01:14] sure God was Jesus Christ was slain
[1:01:17] before the foundation world in the mind
[1:01:18] of God but it had to happen in reality
[1:01:21] here for what a testament what is a
[1:01:25] testament it's a testifying man by the
[1:01:29] which will we are sanctified through the
[1:01:32] offering of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:33] once for all and every priest and if
[1:01:36] daily ministering and offering
[1:01:37] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:01:41] never take away sin but this man this
[1:01:44] woman seed that said I'll put enmity
[1:01:47] back in genesis 3:15 he knew he would
[1:01:51] have to be the one to put it back
[1:01:52] together but this man after he had
[1:01:54] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:01:58] sat down on the right hand of God from
[1:02:00] went forth expecting till his enemies be
[1:02:03] made his footstool for by one offering
[1:02:05] he has perfected forever hold on a
[1:02:09] minute you don't see that I made it
[1:02:14] bigger so y'all the older ones can see
[1:02:16] you look Anderson's going let's read
[1:02:23] this together for by one offering he has
[1:02:30] perfected forever them that are
[1:02:35] sanctified what's your problem what's
[1:02:40] your problem I mean really what's your
[1:02:43] problem we still got a little unbelief
[1:02:47] is what it is we're of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:50] also is a witness because look when he
[1:02:53] takes you from that first life and puts
[1:02:56] that second life in you that is the
[1:02:58] witness that he's there Amen that's the
[1:03:02] witness that he now not only looks over
[1:03:05] you he resides in you where after that
[1:03:10] he said before this is the Covenant that
[1:03:11] I will make with them
[1:03:12] after those days says the Lord I will
[1:03:15] put my laws in their heart and in their
[1:03:17] minds will I write them and their sins
[1:03:20] and iniquities will I always remember oh
[1:03:23] wait a minute roll it up put it up about
[1:03:25] right here up this way up and down we
[1:03:30] got to get that right somewhere and and
[1:03:33] for those of y'all that are sitting up
[1:03:35] front you read this but read it with me
[1:03:36] and their sins and iniquities will I
[1:03:40] remember no or no what more let's read
[1:03:56] acts 1 we don't continue here with the
[1:04:01] promise just for a few minutes less all
[1:04:03] right and being assembled together with
[1:04:05] them commanded them that they should not
[1:04:07] depart from Jerusalem now this is Jesus
[1:04:09] right before he goes up but wait for the
[1:04:12] promise of the father which says he have
[1:04:16] heard of me because remember he just
[1:04:17] told them for John truly baptized with
[1:04:21] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[1:04:24] Holy Ghost not many days hence what a
[1:04:28] promise Romans 4 verse 12 and the father
[1:04:34] of circumcision to them who are not of
[1:04:37] the circumcision only but who also walk
[1:04:39] in the steps of that face of our father
[1:04:41] Abraham which he has been yet
[1:04:43] uncircumcised now for those of you that
[1:04:45] don't know that in the Old Testament
[1:04:47] they would circumcise the Jews with
[1:04:50] circumcised as a sign they would cut the
[1:04:53] foreskin off of the male member and that
[1:04:55] would show that you were under the
[1:04:56] Covenant of Abraham which was a type of
[1:04:59] the Holy Ghost doing away with the first
[1:05:01] life and all the old skin so that was a
[1:05:04] promise but it really never made anybody
[1:05:07] perfect because when Paul comes over
[1:05:10] here he says uncircumcision circumcision
[1:05:12] what are y'all talking about it's not of
[1:05:15] the flesh anymore it's of the inside man
[1:05:17] circumcise the flesh of the inside guy
[1:05:19] all right but who also walk in the steps
[1:05:22] of that face of our father Abraham which
[1:05:24] he had being yet
[1:05:26] circumcised because remember Abraham
[1:05:28] started well listen Abram walked through
[1:05:30] the promise uncircumcised remember he
[1:05:36] was 90 and nine when he was circumcised
[1:05:40] well anyway but remember it was a sign
[1:05:45] and he did his whole household and then
[1:05:48] what happened was that made a whole
[1:05:50] generation that they showed who they
[1:05:52] were why they were separating people you
[1:05:55] were a haven if you weren't circumcised
[1:05:57] but see that was only a what a law or
[1:06:00] that was only a type of the baptism of
[1:06:03] the Holy Ghost that didn't save Abraham
[1:06:05] and that didn't save any of them
[1:06:07] but by faith Abraham did it for the
[1:06:11] promise that he should be the heir of
[1:06:13] the world was not to Abraham or exceed
[1:06:16] through the law but through the
[1:06:20] righteousness of faith for if they which
[1:06:24] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[1:06:27] void in other words do's and don'ts do
[1:06:31] this don't do that do this don't do that
[1:06:33] faith is made void and the promise made
[1:06:36] of no effect because the law worketh
[1:06:39] wrath for where no law is there is no
[1:06:42] transgression therefore it is a faith
[1:06:45] that it might be by grace to the end the
[1:06:49] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:06:54] not to that only which is of the law but
[1:06:57] to that also which is of the faith of
[1:07:00] Abraham who is the father of us all so
[1:07:04] it's by faith are we saved and you say
[1:07:06] well rather you just sit talked about
[1:07:08] do's and don'ts listen you get rid of
[1:07:11] the the first life and you get rid of
[1:07:14] those do's and dont's what's that
[1:07:18] somebody able to make a song the things
[1:07:19] I used to do I do them no more we ought
[1:07:21] to make a song about that Aaron I think
[1:07:24] some of our hair is happening things I
[1:07:27] used to do I do them no more why Paul
[1:07:31] said the life that I now live I live by
[1:07:34] what the faith that God climbed on the
[1:07:37] cross
[1:07:38] for me and for you and died in the flesh
[1:07:43] that he might take his life and bring it
[1:07:46] right back into me and not only just
[1:07:48] push that old life of mine out but I
[1:07:51] nyle ate that life amen
[1:07:54] you better believe that if not then all
[1:07:58] you've done was you just swept him over
[1:07:59] in the closet and shut the door and when
[1:08:02] you need something else you open the
[1:08:04] door to let it out according to the
[1:08:12] Bible your old life must be dead
[1:08:16] I didn't say wife your old life must be
[1:08:22] dead let me tell you something else your
[1:08:24] old husband better be dead because you
[1:08:27] were married to Satan by your first life
[1:08:31] and if that man is not dead you're
[1:08:34] committing adultery and man that goes
[1:08:37] with natural and spiritual but
[1:08:39] spiritually we got to get this thing
[1:08:41] right listen
[1:08:43] Galatians 4 verse 22 I love this no wait
[1:08:46] a minute
[1:08:47] what we do go to Galatians 3 21 we're
[1:08:51] reading scripture today is that Alright
[1:08:55] and I was one that said the other day
[1:08:58] that we don't have to have a quote for
[1:08:59] everything we don't have to have one if
[1:09:01] you're not now to the to the place and I
[1:09:04] know there's young ones here but if
[1:09:05] you're not now to the place that you
[1:09:07] don't know the essence of this message
[1:09:09] then you're just behind I'm sorry you're
[1:09:13] just behind if you can't catch up it's
[1:09:16] not my fault cuz we're throwing it out
[1:09:18] there as fast as we can pull it out
[1:09:20] hey man you can't plead ignorance in
[1:09:23] this church is the law then against the
[1:09:27] promises of God god forbid for if there
[1:09:32] had been a law given which could have
[1:09:34] given life verily righteousness would
[1:09:37] have been by the law that's exactly
[1:09:41] right that's why I put that in there but
[1:09:43] the scripture but the scripture hath
[1:09:46] concluded look the scripture what we're
[1:09:47] reading has concluded all under sin
[1:09:52] remember the whole Hebrews 11 they none
[1:09:55] of them received the promise they still
[1:09:58] came under the sin curse of the Old
[1:10:00] Testament
[1:10:01] now the Old Testament wasn't sin curse
[1:10:03] but the sin curse was in the Old
[1:10:04] Testament okay
[1:10:06] it wasn't annihilate it until Christ
[1:10:08] came okay but the scripture hath
[1:10:10] concluded all under sin so what choice
[1:10:13] do we have
[1:10:13] I mean what's the woman's like some
[1:10:15] people they will will and have a choice
[1:10:16] yeah you got a choice that the promise
[1:10:20] by faith of Jesus Christ might be given
[1:10:22] to them that belief but before faith
[1:10:28] came we were kept under the law shut up
[1:10:34] unto the faith which should afterwards
[1:10:36] be revealed right let me tell you
[1:10:40] something the Bible says in Revelations
[1:10:44] 21 that when that books open and you
[1:10:49] stand before judgment you're going to be
[1:10:51] judged by your works and your works is
[1:10:59] filthy rags in God's eyes but why not
[1:11:03] let's move over into this bride group
[1:11:06] let's move over into this new life to
[1:11:09] where we don't have to stand in judgment
[1:11:11] we stand as the judge judging not by my
[1:11:16] works you know what I'm going to point
[1:11:18] to Christ if I'm born again that's my
[1:11:21] that's my head because that's my shield
[1:11:23] that's my that's my burner that keeps me
[1:11:26] clean as that Holy Ghost that came into
[1:11:28] my soul that kept me clean
[1:11:31] there is therefore now no what
[1:11:34] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:11:36] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:11:40] after the spirit amen
[1:11:41] now look let's go to the latians 4:22
[1:11:44] because we're going to have to transfer
[1:11:46] from that one life to a new life I'd
[1:11:50] rather do things more a new creation in
[1:11:53] Christ and then for it is written that
[1:11:55] Abraham had two sons one by a bond woman
[1:11:59] and the other by a freewoman but he who
[1:12:05] was of the bondwoman was born after the
[1:12:08] flesh now who was that
[1:12:12] Ishmael Sara said go tape mouth and made
[1:12:20] and and less produced the promise for
[1:12:24] God that was Sarah's idea but remember
[1:12:32] God told Abraham to do it like to
[1:12:36] fulfill the promise that he who was of
[1:12:40] the bondwoman was born after the flesh
[1:12:41] look I just got finished reading it
[1:12:43] there in Genesis where Abraham gave a
[1:12:46] lot to Ishmael he didn't deny him as a
[1:12:50] son by the flesh Abraham never denied
[1:12:54] him as the son by the flash right
[1:12:57] he couldn't cuz he was standing there he
[1:13:00] knew he had had that but he had a
[1:13:02] revelation later that what he had by the
[1:13:07] wrong woman he had the wrong kid by the
[1:13:10] wrong woman the promise was to have it
[1:13:12] to Sarah and it was Isaac but he of the
[1:13:16] freewoman was by promise promise of the
[1:13:23] Holy Ghost to come into your life listen
[1:13:27] you were born under the bondwoman all of
[1:13:31] us that's why Christ had to come the way
[1:13:34] he did he didn't come under upon woman
[1:13:35] he didn't come by sex income under
[1:13:39] bondage like you and I we were all born
[1:13:41] in bondage except for one but he was the
[1:13:44] problem
[1:13:44] son to come by the freewoman by the
[1:13:48] woman she'd coming down to earth to live
[1:13:53] in a flesh body just like me in you but
[1:13:56] he was able to fulfill the promise that
[1:13:59] he should know that was God back in
[1:14:03] Genesis 3 well we believe in one God we
[1:14:09] just believe in one God it's not for
[1:14:11] voices or three voices or two voices
[1:14:13] it's one voice Jesus said before Abraham
[1:14:16] was I am
[1:14:19] he was that I am the spoke to Moses in
[1:14:22] the burning bush so he was the one that
[1:14:25] spoke in genesis 3:15 and said I'm
[1:14:27] coming four thousand years from now I'm
[1:14:31] coming you're not going to stop me Satan
[1:14:36] you're not going to stop me nobody's
[1:14:38] going to stop me I am coming to a virgin
[1:14:41] and I am going to clean that womb up I'm
[1:14:44] going to clean you up
[1:14:45] and I'm going to take you back to where
[1:14:48] are you supposed to be that to me is the
[1:14:51] promise the promise is that we got lost
[1:14:55] but we connect ourselves to the eternal
[1:14:58] he's going to take us right back to the
[1:15:01] Garden of Eden where we were supposed to
[1:15:03] be has there not been a fall amen
[1:15:12] Ephesians 1 verse 13 and whom he also
[1:15:17] trusted see this is your first life this
[1:15:21] says and whom ye also trusted after
[1:15:25] after that you started this new life I
[1:15:28] want to ask y'all some one question ask
[1:15:31] you a question
[1:15:32] be honest with me did you think about
[1:15:37] God when you were a sinner
[1:15:43] we got one honest one among us I mean
[1:15:48] did you did you ever I mean sure that
[1:15:51] was times in my life when God would I
[1:15:53] come to church or mom or dad would some
[1:15:55] what happen their life and somebody
[1:15:57] something happened but when you live in
[1:16:01] your common life before you were born
[1:16:03] again do you ever think about God no I
[1:16:06] didn't say think about God I didn't
[1:16:08] think I needed to read my Bible I read
[1:16:11] other things I have come to church why
[1:16:14] Colette have a desire to come that was
[1:16:17] that life that was under the bondwoman
[1:16:21] but thank God the promise was still
[1:16:24] there the promise was eternal the
[1:16:29] promise was there and could not be what
[1:16:32] it could not be annihilated because
[1:16:35] remember the first promise has to be an
[1:16:37] ally or the first life has to be
[1:16:39] annihilated but now when I come into the
[1:16:42] Commonwealth of God and became an
[1:16:45] offspring of God it turned all my
[1:16:47] attention to this things of God thinking
[1:16:55] about God all the time things that
[1:16:57] happen in my life now and your life I
[1:16:59] connect them with God it's a god thing
[1:17:02] you know you connect it with that I
[1:17:05] don't connect it with the world when I
[1:17:06] do something wrong I knew I step down
[1:17:08] and did something wrong trust a God
[1:17:09] forgive me don't you worry about that
[1:17:13] because remember you're still fighting I
[1:17:15] told him down downstairs brother Brahm
[1:17:17] didn't preach the greatest battle ever
[1:17:19] fought was in your soul because remember
[1:17:24] it's not a battle if Satan's in there
[1:17:28] just what I just said did you think
[1:17:30] about God did you think about godly
[1:17:32] things when when you were doing the
[1:17:33] things of the devil no you were the
[1:17:35] devil and you did the things of the
[1:17:37] devil and the devil was the one that had
[1:17:39] control of that inside guy but once you
[1:17:42] had him once you drove him out Luke the
[1:17:47] unclean spirit goes out of a man walking
[1:17:50] Dry places seeking rest find us none
[1:17:52] cometh back finding it swept and
[1:17:53] garnished and if you don't put something
[1:17:55] that new life in
[1:17:56] he's going to come back in there and
[1:17:58] he's going to make you set in a message
[1:17:59] Church and think you save and I write if
[1:18:07] you ever get to oligo
[1:18:08] you'll know I mean David somebody
[1:18:11] yesterday with some person that we were
[1:18:14] talking about we you'll know when that
[1:18:17] person gets to baptism and Holy Ghost a
[1:18:18] some people it's you just going to know
[1:18:20] it cause see they did it with me they
[1:18:22] knew my life had changed when God came
[1:18:24] into my life and gave me the baptism of
[1:18:27] the Holy go people knew that something
[1:18:30] had changed
[1:18:31] and then I didn't just suppress it see a
[1:18:34] lot of times will come to the altar and
[1:18:36] we'll what we'll do is like a guy steady
[1:18:39] sees you just like the being in prison
[1:18:41] you're not sorry that you're that you
[1:18:43] did what you did you're sorry you got
[1:18:45] caught right robbery you've seen that
[1:18:47] meantime they got sorry they got caught
[1:18:49] they always say they find Jesus in jail
[1:18:54] no you're right buddy no what happened
[1:18:57] was they got caught and their conscience
[1:19:01] said you got caught but if you ever take
[1:19:04] and take that what's inside of that and
[1:19:06] let God burn it out that desire won't
[1:19:09] come anymore to do the things that you
[1:19:11] used to do a man because look and whom
[1:19:15] also you trusted after that you heard
[1:19:18] the word of truth the gospel of your
[1:19:21] salvation and whom also after that ye
[1:19:25] believed you were sealed with that holy
[1:19:28] spirit of promise which is the earnest
[1:19:33] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:19:35] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:19:37] praise of his glory the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:41] the earnest let's go to Ephesians 2
[1:19:44] verse 12 then at that time look then at
[1:19:48] that time you were without Christ this
[1:19:51] is your first life being what aliens
[1:19:54] from the Commonwealth of Israel and
[1:19:56] strangers from the covenants of promise
[1:20:00] that's what I just told you about we
[1:20:03] were strangers walking around in the
[1:20:05] world doing the world doing the things
[1:20:06] of the world but remember if you're a
[1:20:08] child of God and
[1:20:09] you're coming to God you become a
[1:20:11] stranger amen
[1:20:14] you become a little different and
[1:20:18] strangers from the covenants of promise
[1:20:20] having no hope and without God in the
[1:20:24] world but now in Christ Jesus ye who
[1:20:28] sometimes were far off are made nigh
[1:20:31] what that gap is being pulled together
[1:20:34] that enmity that came in and the Old
[1:20:38] Testament there was no way for God to
[1:20:40] get back to man but when God became man
[1:20:44] he put it all back together amen but now
[1:20:47] in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were
[1:20:49] far off are made nigh by the white blood
[1:20:53] of Christ for he is our peace who has
[1:20:56] made both one and has broken down the
[1:20:59] middle wall of partition between us the
[1:21:02] lords that division remember Hey look
[1:21:04] before you became before you became a
[1:21:06] Christian you didn't want to be around
[1:21:08] Christian just for a few minutes maybe
[1:21:11] come on people
[1:21:13] everybody say man hey man
[1:21:16] that Saint the old grandma all yours if
[1:21:19] she started talking about God just like
[1:21:20] grandma I think I'll go outside and
[1:21:21] count to ass in the yard or something
[1:21:23] I'm you know I'm not right we will not
[1:21:27] to do it while we were alienated we
[1:21:29] didn't want any of that that wasn't for
[1:21:32] us how many of you said that I cannot
[1:21:33] for me but now in Christ Jesus ye who
[1:21:38] sometimes were far off are made nigh why
[1:21:41] now you want to be around Christian why
[1:21:43] do you won't be around Christian because
[1:21:45] you like minded you draw strength that's
[1:21:48] why we come that's why I come to church
[1:21:50] I sorry I don't come to see y'all I come
[1:21:53] to get a refilling I come to get
[1:21:56] refueled I'm glad you're here and you're
[1:22:00] my friends but I don't come to them you
[1:22:03] know bro Kali ain't there today you
[1:22:04] ain't going no if brother Kali ain't
[1:22:07] here I'm coming I'm not gonna ask
[1:22:09] whether he's here or not I used you
[1:22:12] because I know what could but now in
[1:22:14] Christ Jesus he being sometimes were far
[1:22:16] off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
[1:22:18] where he is our peace who has made for
[1:22:20] one both one both war
[1:22:23] and that's broken down the middle wall
[1:22:25] of partition between us having abolished
[1:22:28] now look I like that word abolish that
[1:22:30] means done away with having abolished in
[1:22:33] his flesh the enmity now that word
[1:22:35] enmity was way over in Genesis right
[1:22:38] amen
[1:22:39] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[1:22:42] even the law of Commandments contained
[1:22:45] in ordinances he talked about the Old
[1:22:47] Testament he talking about the Torah
[1:22:49] he's talking about all that in the Old
[1:22:51] Testament you know somebody said the
[1:22:55] other day we were talking about and no
[1:22:57] offence stand by here I was going to say
[1:22:58] this anyway you know the Bible says a
[1:23:02] woman shouldn't wear clothes pertaining
[1:23:03] to a man and somebody said well that's
[1:23:05] the Old Testament I said you believe in
[1:23:07] the Ten Commandments she said yeah I
[1:23:09] said that's in the Old Testament thing
[1:23:16] having a pretty brother having abolished
[1:23:19] in his flesh then I thought you'd sleep
[1:23:21] like that for me hey you get over set
[1:23:24] closer to board he'll start doing that
[1:23:26] even the law of Commandments contained
[1:23:28] in ordinances listen let me be honest
[1:23:32] with you like I wasn't going to be this
[1:23:34] is not do's and don'ts I did the things
[1:23:39] I do because of what my wife bottom line
[1:23:47] but when the life of Christ came in me
[1:23:50] the things I used to do I do them no
[1:23:54] more why because I have turned what is
[1:23:58] repent turn now look one preacher was
[1:24:01] preaching one time he says when I
[1:24:02] repented he said I turn he said I did a
[1:24:04] 360
[1:24:08] a 360 is this same way you were going
[1:24:13] you got to do a 180 I think you talking
[1:24:18] about Michael Jordan doing a 360 you
[1:24:19] know I think you got to do it 160 180
[1:24:24] thank you your weight 180 and go this
[1:24:28] way good job I told them I was gonna
[1:24:34] keep him waiting huh but now look this
[1:24:37] is what I want to get to full clothes
[1:24:38] right here I'm not going to ever get
[1:24:40] them a - light - I'm gonna get well I
[1:24:42] got a demand I mean Cain and Abel out of
[1:24:44] the wound of the day so might as well
[1:24:45] get this done having abolished in his
[1:24:47] flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:24:49] commandments contained in ordinances
[1:24:50] because remember look real quick he
[1:24:56] abolished in his place remember it
[1:24:59] wasn't that God was not wholly during
[1:25:01] the Old Testament but he was a spirit
[1:25:05] God is a spirit now remember it's
[1:25:07] theophany he was showed itself in many
[1:25:09] forms he did come down in human flesh
[1:25:11] but he didn't come down as the woman
[1:25:13] seed he wasn't the woman's seed as
[1:25:17] Melchizedek
[1:25:18] he wasn't the woman's seed as the
[1:25:20] captain of the host right a man so he
[1:25:24] had to come in when he said I when he
[1:25:27] talked about the woman see that meant he
[1:25:28] was coming in human flesh and man even
[1:25:32] the law of commandments contained in
[1:25:33] order to score to make in himself of
[1:25:35] plain one new man so making peace and
[1:25:42] that he might reconcile both unto God in
[1:25:46] one body by the cross having slain the
[1:25:50] enmity thereby he took he took genesis
[1:25:54] 3:15 and just didn't do away with it no
[1:25:59] he didn't remember Christ didn't do away
[1:26:01] with the law he magnified it
[1:26:04] he made genesis 3:15 like brother Shetty
[1:26:07] was saying Wednesday night I love that
[1:26:08] he made genesis 3:15 step right out of
[1:26:11] the scripture
[1:26:13] and I tell you that thing that dad's got
[1:26:16] back there if you've seen it we'll look
[1:26:19] at next Sunday I'll put up on the screen
[1:26:20] but it's the Bible being flipped open
[1:26:22] and there's pages and they come up and
[1:26:24] they form a man the Word made flesh and
[1:26:27] then you see Jesus will put your put you
[1:26:30] in there put you in there whatever
[1:26:37] speaks of Christ speaks to you in the
[1:26:40] beginning was the word and if you're
[1:26:42] part of the word now you were there you
[1:26:45] weren't there in a human body you
[1:26:46] weren't there in anything except God's
[1:26:49] eternal mind the eternal section I was
[1:26:53] like I told you last Sunday there's
[1:26:56] books books of life brother Brown said
[1:26:59] there's one part that of sinners is
[1:27:00] eating him right in the book I got quote
[1:27:04] him write him in a book in other words
[1:27:06] he didn't even have to keep up with
[1:27:07] their life not that he didn't want to he
[1:27:11] wanted to he wanted all saved but he
[1:27:14] knew that see that's what helps me with
[1:27:16] God with foreknowledge he could give it
[1:27:19] a new he could give Adolf Hitler ten
[1:27:21] million years and he'd never accept
[1:27:23] Jesus Christ he could give anybody you
[1:27:28] say give him a billion years they'd
[1:27:30] never accept he knew that therefore he
[1:27:33] collect them live their life on earth
[1:27:35] and go and die and be sent to torment
[1:27:38] because he knew if he give them millions
[1:27:41] of years they never would come to God
[1:27:43] because what foreknowledge he knew they
[1:27:45] never come to that what the Bible says
[1:27:48] coming to the knowledge of the truth you
[1:27:51] and I one day we came to the knowledge
[1:27:53] that this Bible and this Christ that
[1:27:56] died at Calvary was the truth it wasn't
[1:27:59] a fairy tale it was something that
[1:28:01] actually happened and it didn't happen
[1:28:04] for you
[1:28:05] it happened for me it didn't happen for
[1:28:09] you it happened for me it's for me only
[1:28:13] you're not included you better say the
[1:28:17] same thing
[1:28:19] because I can't go in on you and you
[1:28:21] can't go in on me but we can all go in
[1:28:24] on him a man you love Lord I'll tell you
[1:28:32] what let's just stop right there
[1:28:34] for to turn anybody going please I
[1:28:37] didn't say was going to close and go
[1:28:39] home yet but having abolished in his
[1:28:42] flesh the enmity so we've got the enmity
[1:28:45] abolished we've got the two lives though
[1:28:49] that we have to deal with for Jamaican
[1:28:51] himself of twain one new man what in
[1:28:55] other words he comes in and does it now
[1:28:58] listen he doesn't kill you as far as you
[1:29:03] you being dead and yet so leaves you he
[1:29:07] kills the nature that you were born
[1:29:09] under that's the old life and then you
[1:29:14] become a what a new creation listen if
[1:29:17] you don't if you don't think different
[1:29:21] if you don't act different listen we all
[1:29:26] have problems we all have ups and downs
[1:29:28] I told him downstairs I said look I
[1:29:30] promise you eternal life he didn't
[1:29:31] promise you a perfect life because he
[1:29:34] said you gonna have problems because you
[1:29:36] know why we have problems cuz we're
[1:29:38] alienated we're we're aliens to this
[1:29:40] world we don't even think like this
[1:29:43] world people y'all work with people and
[1:29:45] you listen to them you go my heaven
[1:29:46] where they get that from
[1:29:49] alright your own sister sometimes you
[1:29:54] know you yeah oh hey Jean I don't see
[1:29:57] sentiments all right but listen you
[1:30:00] listen to them talk no please you listen
[1:30:03] to them talking you go where did that
[1:30:05] come from how can you think that you
[1:30:10] know what it's the devil that's what he
[1:30:14] thinks God didn't put that thought in
[1:30:17] your mind if it's contrary to the word
[1:30:22] you just had a thought of your own and
[1:30:25] you're not listening you're not going to
[1:30:28] help those thoughts coming but you're
[1:30:30] being given a promise
[1:30:32] that if you're what have faith and what
[1:30:35] he's already saying turn your eyes
[1:30:38] toward him don't worry about the things
[1:30:42] of the world you just got to know that
[1:30:45] you know that you know that your first
[1:30:48] life is over over not two or three
[1:30:55] months later let it come back up over
[1:31:01] over and honestly you need to have put
[1:31:05] that on your on your refrigerator we put
[1:31:08] everything in world on a refrigerator
[1:31:09] but the things I used to do I do them no
[1:31:14] more now if you're lying you're not
[1:31:16] walking in okay the things I used to do
[1:31:20] I do them no more I come to church
[1:31:22] expecting God to talk to me I come to
[1:31:26] church not expecting to learn something
[1:31:28] that somebody else don't know that's the
[1:31:32] devil that's intelligence but I come for
[1:31:36] God to put pieces together questions
[1:31:40] yesterday we were talking about things
[1:31:41] about angels I had a question well one
[1:31:43] of the questions for answered just by a
[1:31:45] simple conversation why because it was
[1:31:48] what it was to people that has a new
[1:31:49] book that we're able to talk to each
[1:31:51] other because really it's not I live
[1:31:54] anymore
[1:31:55] its Christ that liveth in me and the
[1:31:58] life I now live there's a scripture in
[1:32:00] the Bible for them yeah I think I read
[1:32:02] it forehead first was the life I now
[1:32:05] live I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:32:09] God who lit who give his life and died
[1:32:12] he said this is just an old salvation
[1:32:15] story if we ever get away from an old
[1:32:16] salvation story and think that it's
[1:32:19] boring why do you think the sons of God
[1:32:22] shouted for joy because they saw the
[1:32:25] plan of redemption I just told you the
[1:32:28] plan of redemption was Jesus Christ
[1:32:31] coming to earth and human flesh dying
[1:32:33] resurrected couldn't come back into the
[1:32:36] believers at that time because he was in
[1:32:38] flesh but when he went back up and
[1:32:40] ascended to the Father he what he didn't
[1:32:43] send another person
[1:32:46] he just stepped over in that spirit form
[1:32:48] again and come right down into the
[1:32:50] believer hey man and that's the reason
[1:32:53] we can understand the Word of God that's
[1:32:54] the reason we can understand preachers
[1:32:56] preaching the Word of God is because we
[1:32:58] got the one that wrote it inside of us
[1:33:01] let me tell you something if you can't
[1:33:04] understand the Word of God you don't
[1:33:07] have the whole ego sorry I didn't say
[1:33:12] all of it but if you know if you're not
[1:33:17] if you don't have a clue you need to you
[1:33:22] need the one that gives you the clue
[1:33:24] because remember he said he would what
[1:33:26] leads you and guide you into all truth
[1:33:31] he will not leave you comfortless he
[1:33:34] will not leave you out in the dark but
[1:33:37] you know what a problem is
[1:33:38] God turns the lights on we turn them on
[1:33:40] got turned the lights on we turn them
[1:33:42] off is all right we turn them off leave
[1:33:46] the light on just don't be like the
[1:33:51] people say the lights on but nobody's
[1:33:53] home I like this right here new man
[1:33:59] new woman I've seen in the let's stand
[1:34:04] our feet we just has come I've seen in
[1:34:06] our life my life being back here I've
[1:34:09] seen a lot of us change and you know one
[1:34:13] thing's for sure
[1:34:14] it's God that did it because you and I
[1:34:18] can't do it our problem is is we've seen
[1:34:22] people come and go and some that we
[1:34:27] thought would stay wooden and some that
[1:34:29] we thought wouldn't did that's why you
[1:34:32] can't figure it out you just let God
[1:34:35] handle it and then you just sit back and
[1:34:39] watch God do his plan he'll work her
[1:34:42] right out every time problem is is we
[1:34:45] stick we go jump right in the middle of
[1:34:47] the plan no stay away stay away just
[1:34:53] open up your heart and let God come in
[1:34:56] that's just as simple and then you know
[1:34:59] what after that after you come into this
[1:35:01] great Commonwealth of God then you get

[1:38:23] children the Lord Jesus with great in
[1:38:27] your precious name Lord you're the
[1:38:29] creator that you would take her Lord and

[1:38:39] lawyer and all that depression and the
[1:38:42] anger the things that she has were
[1:38:43] afraid to take those things away and
[1:38:46] give our brother silver here people that
[1:38:49] they were depend on his father for
[1:38:51] whatever happens we look to you in the
[1:38:53] name of Jesus Christ already
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:12] you believe that listen all the players
[1:39:17] are on the field people back in the ages
[1:39:22] they had to wait on a prophet to come
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:25] number four of Elijah had to wait so
[1:39:28] that's what the Bible said I had to wait
[1:39:30] for brother Ram to come on the scene
[1:39:31] preach this message and then then
[1:39:33] revelations 10-7 had to be brought in
[1:39:35] two days of the voice of the seven thing
[1:39:38] then you've got 144,000 Jews that's
[1:39:41] sitting over in Israel already back
[1:39:43] together somewhere in there they're
[1:39:45] waiting that can't be babies they can't
[1:39:47] be dead they got to be alive you got two
[1:39:50] witnesses it's got to come the fifth
[1:39:53] coming of Elijah and Moses got to go the
[1:39:55] Jews what's holding this thing up we are
[1:39:59] I told them this morning the right of
[1:40:01] redemption was that Boaz the type of
[1:40:06] Christ but Boaz redeemed Naomi right and
[1:40:12] he got Ruth right but what happened was
[1:40:18] that wasn't the whole story Boaz and
[1:40:23] Ruth had to have a child and had to take
[1:40:26] that child and turn him back over to
[1:40:29] Naomi amen
[1:40:31] the right of redemption is not over
[1:40:33] until the Gentiles produce Jesus Christ
[1:40:37] and send him to the Jew we're holding
[1:40:41] this thing up it's our problem I've
[1:40:45] considered it my problem that we're not
[1:40:46] out of here we not a resurrection and
[1:40:50] the only reason resurrection is not
[1:40:51] happening somebody don't have enough
[1:40:52] faith at the moment to speak it and it
[1:40:56] come to pass
[1:40:57] we got to build that faith and not then
[1:41:01] listen it can't be an artificial faith
[1:41:02] either because you know what's going to
[1:41:03] happen use on an artificially build it
[1:41:06] up and Satan's the first one is gonna
[1:41:07] come by and he's gonna kick her down
[1:41:08] right but you let God do it let God
[1:41:13] raise that up let God do the speaking
[1:41:19] have a passion for this message have a
[1:41:23] passion for God and you know what he's
[1:41:27] the greatest lover that ever will
[1:41:29] he knows every move you need he knows
[1:41:32] every everyday what you need before you
[1:41:35] need it hey man he knows what you're
[1:41:42] going through he knows what you need and
[1:41:45] he's already put it there in the Word of
[1:41:49] God a way to get over it but the
[1:41:54] greatest thing is that God has got
[1:41:57] everything right where it's supposed to
[1:41:58] be lifted we don't have another church
[1:42:03] egg we don't have another prophet to
[1:42:05] come we don't have another message to
[1:42:07] come so what's left
[1:42:10] produce what's already been spoke we
[1:42:14] must produce it we must start speaking
[1:42:17] and expect God to do something not just
[1:42:21] hope he does well I think I'll just I'll
[1:42:25] just whisper it and if they don't happen
[1:42:27] it won't make me look bad
[1:42:30] how we gonna get the dead out of the
[1:42:32] ground without you got to have a bold
[1:42:35] face Jesus walked up to the tomb and
[1:42:39] brother Brown said Jesus did not have to
[1:42:41] pray to raise Lazarus he was already
[1:42:44] prayed up before the foundation of the
[1:42:46] world where where were you you were in
[1:42:49] that man before the foundation of the
[1:42:51] world but we're already prayed up we
[1:42:55] just got to realize then there's the
[1:42:58] evening time folks this is not the
[1:43:00] morning this is not the afternoon this
[1:43:03] is the evening time and the next thing
[1:43:08] for us is getting out of here going home
[1:43:11] it's going home time it's time for us to
[1:43:13] get out of here sometimes we love this
[1:43:16] world and too many things of the world
[1:43:18] and we push we push God aside but you
[1:43:23] know what he's very patient he's waited
[1:43:26] for 2,000 years for us to get here he's
[1:43:31] waited for 6,000 years to take that
[1:43:34] woman seed and show it to the world not
[1:43:39] just Jesus Christ the person Jesus
[1:43:42] Christ in you Paul said the hope of
[1:43:44] glory amen he loved the Lord let's all
[1:43:48] bow our head the Heavenly Father would
[1:43:52] praise it

[1:43:56] heart Lord and that we'll all take this
[1:43:59] under consideration
[1:44:03] that if we made a list of what's next or
[1:44:07] what we need for for the end time to to
[1:44:11] come to pass there would be a very short
[1:44:13] list because this is that day when you

[1:44:21] 80 30 somewhere in there you spoke that
[1:44:23] words at that day you shall know that I
