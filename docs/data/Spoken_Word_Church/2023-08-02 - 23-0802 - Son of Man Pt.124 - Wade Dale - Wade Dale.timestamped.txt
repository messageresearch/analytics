[16:19] with us
[16:20] Lord just settle our weary Soul father
[16:23] of all the different things that Lord we
[16:24] haven't done
[16:26] to worry with in life Lord and just for
[16:28] a few minutes
[16:29] just for a few minutes as the priest
[16:32] would take the
[16:34] blood back into the holy of holies and
[16:38] and when that curtain would drop it'd be
[16:40] dead silent
[16:42] it would just be you and the priest well
[16:45] father I pray that today Lord we dropped
[16:47] the curtain behind us of the world and
[16:49] the things and the thoughts and the
[16:50] ideas and the and the things that we
[16:53] have to do in our job and just for a few
[16:55] moments Lord let's let us listen to you
[16:57] father
[16:58] we ask you to be the ones of the sick be
[17:00] the ones who are not with us we Lord we
[17:03] pray for sister Freda and the different
[17:04] ones Lord the ones that are going for
[17:06] tests
[17:07] um Dad's going for tests I think Monday
[17:09] or so and then my test is going to be on
[17:11] the 25th of August I pray Lord that you
[17:13] would just be with the hand of the
[17:15] surgeon and the different things and and
[17:17] the technicians and we pray that you
[17:19] everything would be just fine for your
[17:21] honor and Glory just bless us now Lord
[17:23] and further moment of service in Jesus
[17:25] name we pray
[17:26] amen
[17:27] the Bible says in the beginning was the
[17:29] word where was with God and the Word was
[17:30] God and that word was made flesh
[17:32] endorsed among us and we beheld his
[17:34] glory the glory the only begotten of the
[17:36] father full of grace and truth
[17:39] I know y'all can't see that sorry about
[17:40] that I missed the step
[17:43] y'all can go and be seated
[17:46] sorry about that
[17:48] thinking about other stuff and
[17:51] but what you just hang on a man
[17:52] technology
[17:54] technology okay look all right now that
[17:58] better
[17:59] okay hmm
[18:04] John 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered and
[18:06] said that's kind of what we're going to
[18:07] speak on tonight is the new birth
[18:09] because it is one of the most ill-taught
[18:11] subjects I believe if you took him and
[18:14] and maybe went to a a restaurant and and
[18:17] just walked up to a table and says are
[18:20] you a Christian if they say yes say well
[18:22] what do you what how do you get how did
[18:24] you get saved
[18:25] and you'll get a lot of different ideas
[18:29] and opinions and and you'll get a lot of
[18:32] well I did this and I did that and I
[18:34] started going to church or I cried or I
[18:36] uh or I shook a pastor's hand and I I
[18:40] moved my letter into the Baptist Church
[18:42] and I did this in the Methodist Church
[18:44] and I was baptized in the name of father
[18:46] son Holy Ghost and yours you get all
[18:48] these different ideas but there's got to
[18:50] be one truth
[18:52] when Jesus said verily verily I say unto
[18:54] thee except the man be born again one
[18:56] one birth
[18:58] all right now remember your first birth
[19:00] is your problem
[19:03] all right and without the second birth
[19:05] your first birth is going to be your
[19:07] problem still all right but after you
[19:10] get born here to be a flesh person and
[19:12] we'll talk about that in a minute
[19:14] Jesus tells Nicodemus except a man be
[19:16] born again he cannot see or understand
[19:19] the kingdom of God and that's our
[19:22] problem
[19:23] maybe in the message I I just happened
[19:27] to uh I don't think I'll ever do that
[19:30] again but I got on YouTube and and to
[19:32] believe the sign people were on
[19:34] and I kind of clicked on it don't even
[19:37] waste your time
[19:39] don't even waste your time
[19:43] amen I mean unless you believe unless
[19:45] you believe whatever sign they believe I
[19:48] changed my name if I believe the sign I
[19:50] don't know what kind of sign they
[19:51] believe in but I know one thing's for
[19:53] sure they really are ridiculed in
[19:55] brother Branham and call him all kind of
[19:56] false and a liar and all these different
[19:59] things so and they're trying to save
[20:01] people from the message well thank God
[20:04] he saved me from that
[20:06] amen thank God he saved me from that and
[20:09] gave me an understanding I mean they're
[20:11] playing clips of brother Donnie and
[20:12] different ones and both Tim Pruitt and
[20:14] all you know saying what they say about
[20:16] the the whole thing but I just want to
[20:18] ask them one thing if brother Brown was
[20:20] not the messenger a Malachi 4 God's got
[20:23] to send us one
[20:25] because he said in the Bible he had to
[20:26] send us one before the great and
[20:28] Dreadful day of the Lord they can't take
[20:30] out Malachi 4 they say stay with the
[20:32] Bible well let's stay with the Bible
[20:33] Malachi 4 says God's going to send us a
[20:35] prophet that would turn us around from
[20:37] where we were well if he don't send them
[20:39] then God's a liar
[20:41] right
[20:43] but God's already sent him we know that
[20:45] but I they must be looking for something
[20:47] else
[20:48] but what they need is is they need for
[20:50] Jesus to say very very I say unto you
[20:53] except you be born of water and spirit
[20:55] you cannot enter the kingdom of God or
[20:57] in other words you can't understand the
[21:00] kingdom of God
[21:02] and and and what gets me is is the whole
[21:05] time the the brother was talking he was
[21:08] talking about the Holy Spirit told me
[21:09] this and the Holy Spirit told me that
[21:12] his holy spirit's got to be different
[21:14] from mine because it ain't telling me
[21:15] the same thing it was telling him one of
[21:17] us is wrong
[21:18] all right but I'll I'll hang my soul on
[21:21] what I'm seeing here
[21:23] all right I'm I'm sold out but just
[21:26] don't even worry about that believe the
[21:27] sign bunch
[21:28] let me just put it this way they're
[21:31] Folly our hours will be made manifest so
[21:33] don't worry
[21:35] when we come to the end of the road
[21:37] one of us
[21:39] is going to be false and the other one
[21:43] is going to be true
[21:44] all right so I'm not going to sit here
[21:46] and and preach sermon after sermon the
[21:48] white brother Brown and what we think he
[21:50] was a prophet if you don't know that by
[21:52] now then you're going to be deceived
[21:55] you really are going to be deceived all
[21:57] right because remember it would almost
[21:59] deceive the very Act
[22:01] the Bible says if it were possible it
[22:04] would get so close to where it would
[22:06] confuse her and that's what's happening
[22:08] now there's a lot of confusion in the
[22:09] message number one about the new birth
[22:12] they say some say that it's this and
[22:15] some say even in the message that is
[22:17] that and some say that you are that you
[22:19] just realize and it's kind of like a
[22:21] light switch you know you always had the
[22:23] power you just turned the light switch
[22:24] on and you start believing the message
[22:26] well that's I don't believe that
[22:29] I'll tell you where brother Brown talks
[22:31] about that here in just a minute and I
[22:33] really appreciate this one quoted that
[22:34] God gave me yesterday to put in here and
[22:38] marble knot that I said unto you now
[22:40] look he's told Nicodemus Nicodemus is
[22:42] probably going
[22:45] he said Marvel not Nicodemus you know
[22:47] the whole dissertation was is you're the
[22:49] teacher
[22:49] you're the number one guy uh and even
[22:52] Nicodemus said we know you're a teacher
[22:55] sent from God well then when he tells
[22:57] then when the teacher that sent from God
[22:59] tells them Nicodemus what to do it's
[23:01] kind of like us
[23:03] Lord what can we do what can we do we'll
[23:05] do the a b and c and you don't do one of
[23:07] them
[23:08] and you wonder why God didn't do
[23:09] something for you right well do ABC
[23:13] always believe Christ
[23:14] but Marvel not
[23:16] that I say unto you you must be born
[23:19] again brother Brown says and you must be
[23:21] born again says God bless his word and I
[23:23] want to take the subject this morning of
[23:24] Jesus's first Doctrine
[23:27] the first doctrine of Jesus was you must
[23:29] be born again that was his first
[23:31] Doctrine now he's talking about Sunday
[23:33] school and he says look so I have
[23:34] thought my heart this is something that
[23:36] seems puzzling to the people we hear so
[23:38] much about it all the time I thought it
[23:41] would be good this morning if we could
[23:42] search the subject clear it out and
[23:44] that's the first beginning you must be
[23:45] born again and it's the very deep one
[23:48] and we find out that there are so many
[23:50] different meanings that people put to it
[23:52] nearly all churches say You must be born
[23:54] again but each one has their different
[23:57] interpretation to that what it means to
[24:00] be born again
[24:02] and and you know you you say well I know
[24:04] I'm born again because of XYZ I know I'm
[24:08] born again and everybody's got their
[24:09] place to put that you know I was born
[24:11] again because all right but we know
[24:14] according to what we see in this church
[24:16] that we know that we have to go through
[24:18] justification we have to go through
[24:20] sanctification and then we go to the
[24:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is an
[24:24] inward filling it's not an anointing
[24:28] and we've got to know the difference
[24:30] all right because the anointing can look
[24:33] and feel like the true Holy Ghost and
[24:35] can be the true Holy Ghost
[24:38] but you can be deceived in your soul and
[24:41] not let him in
[24:42] and now what anointing ones is brother
[24:44] Brown said you have the baptism Holy
[24:46] Ghost every day in your life on your
[24:47] spirit on your second realm and die and
[24:50] go to hell because your soul and we'll
[24:53] read it here just a minute that's that
[24:54] same group that comes up and says have I
[24:56] not have I not have I not have I not
[24:58] have I not cast out Devils have I not
[25:00] preached your message have I not done
[25:02] this have I not done that he says depart
[25:04] from me I never knew you
[25:06] in other words never had an intimate
[25:08] relationship with you
[25:10] now brother Brian said look there must
[25:11] be an is a truth somewhere so now
[25:14] remember it didn't say you ought to be
[25:15] born again it says You must
[25:18] be born again not you ought to you must
[25:20] be born again
[25:22] now watch no matter how much do we try
[25:25] to think we're right in saying a Creed
[25:27] or join a church or saying we always was
[25:29] eternal you're still what you were until
[25:31] you're actually born again of the spirit
[25:33] of God
[25:34] so what changes you the actual New Birth
[25:37] is what changes you all right it doesn't
[25:40] change you what's he saying it doesn't I
[25:41] didn't say anything to say the new birth
[25:43] he's saying all that Creed and stuff
[25:44] that don't change you your Creed joining
[25:47] Church change your idea are you good
[25:49] intentions although it's good it may
[25:50] seem it's still not right there's
[25:52] something got to happen the new birth is
[25:54] an experience all right every one of
[25:57] your sisters that have had children like
[25:59] I said Sunday you were there when it
[26:01] happened
[26:03] and and unless you were just not silly
[26:05] you knew what was going on
[26:07] when it was going on when the birth was
[26:09] happening all right so it was an
[26:11] experience it was something you went
[26:13] through water blood and spirit
[26:15] just like the new birth water blood and
[26:17] spirit so the new birth is an experience
[26:20] something that takes place
[26:22] so it is not that that brings the new
[26:25] birth which is what the Creeds that's
[26:26] not what brings in your birth now the
[26:29] different churches say well you accept
[26:30] this or believe that that's all right
[26:31] but it isn't that's what people now that
[26:33] if you believe the message you got to be
[26:35] born again no the devil believes that
[26:37] more than you do because he studies it
[26:39] more than you do then people believe the
[26:41] sign I believe they tell you the message
[26:42] more than we do
[26:44] they have their little quotes and little
[26:46] things and all those stuff they say
[26:47] brother around this brother around them
[26:49] they can study all they want to
[26:52] now to begin with to base back the
[26:55] reason we have to be born against
[26:56] because the Bible teaches us that we
[26:58] were all born and sin
[27:02] shapened and iniquity
[27:06] and come to this world
[27:08] a cute little liar
[27:12] then that shows us that our nature to
[27:16] begin with is sinful to start with
[27:20] we're no good to begin with so we cannot
[27:23] claim anything by our scrutiness that's
[27:25] why I said we if we boast that we're in
[27:28] the message and and we were always was
[27:30] this eternal group and we always this
[27:31] and always that
[27:33] where's this
[27:36] where's this our nature is sinful to
[27:39] begin with all right and God will not
[27:41] dwell in an unclean vessel
[27:44] so there's not God in there and the
[27:46] devil there at the same time
[27:48] it's one or the other not both all right
[27:51] everybody with me
[27:53] all right
[27:54] so we cannot claim anything by our
[27:56] shrewness our sincerity how great we are
[27:59] how little we are or whatever more we're
[28:01] all together wrong to begin with boy
[28:04] that puts us all on a Level Playing
[28:05] Field brother Georgia just makes no big
[28:07] eyes no little use everybody's the same
[28:09] you all got to be born again to be the
[28:13] bride
[28:14] thereby with me to be the bride you have
[28:17] to be born of the spirit of God the old
[28:20] nature burnout the new nature put in a
[28:23] new creature a new creation in Christ
[28:25] Jesus we are all together wrong to begin
[28:28] with and there is nothing that we can do
[28:31] about it
[28:33] you had nothing to do to get you here
[28:35] but now when you got here and you come
[28:37] to the age of accountability you then
[28:40] have something to do with it
[28:42] all right
[28:44] so we come here we see that
[28:46] Joel 2 says it shall come to pass that I
[28:49] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[28:52] your son and your daughters are
[28:53] prophesying your old mental dream dreams
[28:55] young men will see visions and you know
[28:57] what this is doing this is this is
[29:00] broadening uh the brush that God has uh
[29:03] has the the stroke that God has given to
[29:06] the world he's given everybody a chance
[29:07] he threw it out there
[29:09] now listen we do we do preach an
[29:13] exclusive gospel
[29:15] all right hang on we do because God said
[29:18] separate
[29:19] all right God says separate yourself
[29:21] that was what Israel's problem they
[29:23] didn't separate themselves but God says
[29:26] you separate yourself and then when he
[29:28] God sent us a prophet thank God one day
[29:31] he's told Brother Branham and through
[29:33] prophecy he said now I call you bride
[29:36] well see that separated us from the
[29:39] church because the church is going to go
[29:41] through the tribulation but the bride
[29:42] will not go through the tribulation why
[29:45] because the bride is Born Again of the
[29:49] spirit of God in their soul and they're
[29:51] a new creation a new creature but he's
[29:55] still going to pour out his Spirit upon
[29:56] All Flesh their people are going to
[29:58] gonna receive the Holy Ghost as an
[30:00] anointing
[30:02] foolish virgin will will keep that on
[30:06] him for a period of time but I'll read
[30:09] it to you in a minute
[30:10] where brother Brown becomes says it
[30:12] comes down to one thing
[30:14] that's the word
[30:16] it comes down to the word it's nothing
[30:18] else but the word of God being preached
[30:21] in its truth and in its entirety all
[30:24] right because listen listen the Baptists
[30:27] have truth
[30:28] but they don't have truth in its
[30:30] entirety
[30:31] the methods have truth but they don't
[30:33] have truth in its entirety and if you
[30:35] don't grow up in God and you're just
[30:37] still a little baby with the Holy Ghost
[30:39] and you're still having uh uh diaper
[30:42] issues
[30:44] or feeding issues or eating issues
[30:46] there's something wrong with you
[30:49] you got to grow up you're supposed to
[30:50] grow up God wants us to grow up listen
[30:52] he requires it we grow up
[30:54] right all right if he requires we grow
[30:56] up though he has to give us the simplest
[30:59] way to do that ever
[31:05] we make it hard
[31:07] he doesn't we make it hard to grow
[31:11] Hebrews 9 verse 6. now when these things
[31:13] were thus ordained was talking about the
[31:15] priest going back into the Tabernacle
[31:19] a watch but into the second went to high
[31:21] priest alone so he went into the holy of
[31:23] holies
[31:24] with the blood which he offered for
[31:26] himself and for the people
[31:29] verse 8 says in the Holy Ghost this
[31:31] signifying that the way unto the holiest
[31:33] of all was not yet made manifest while
[31:35] as yet the first Tabernacle was yet
[31:37] standing in other words
[31:39] while the law was in effect there was no
[31:42] new birth
[31:45] right
[31:47] and and and that's a revelation that a
[31:50] lot of people in a message don't have
[31:51] that there was no new birth until the
[31:53] day of Pentecost now there was feelings
[31:55] those anointings
[31:57] that came on John the Baptist Baptist
[31:59] got the Holy Ghost but he didn't get the
[32:00] new birth
[32:03] I mean the Bible even tells us in the
[32:05] Book of John it says the Holy Ghost will
[32:06] not get given because Jesus had not been
[32:08] glorified
[32:10] he had to die to release that life
[32:12] that's why it was that's why Nicodemus
[32:15] really couldn't understand because there
[32:17] stood Jesus with every bit of that
[32:18] inside of him and that Shield of flesh
[32:21] is what shielded him from the priest
[32:25] knowing who he was
[32:26] right you a man making yourself God
[32:30] no it was God making himself a man but
[32:34] they couldn't understand that
[32:36] so while the first Tabernacle was
[32:38] standing there was an ordinance that a
[32:41] priest went behind the veil with the
[32:44] blood for every person in Israel and
[32:47] those who accepted it were free for
[32:49] another year
[32:51] but remember it didn't make the comer
[32:53] there unto perfect it only pushed his
[32:56] sin to the next year
[32:59] I know it's Elementary but we got to get
[33:01] to somewhere and there was a lot of
[33:02] young people here that need to know that
[33:04] they need to be born again all right
[33:07] we're gonna have a lot of problems but
[33:09] if you'll get born again I'll promise
[33:10] you it'll help you get through them
[33:13] so see that's what gives me a confidence
[33:17] because in the Old Testament if you were
[33:19] a child and you went to school you had
[33:21] to go to a high priest or you had to
[33:23] depend on a high priest to go sacrifice
[33:26] something for you
[33:30] but now you have something to do with it
[33:32] children you come to the throne of grace
[33:36] you come up here bowling as we did
[33:38] Sunday and we prayed the prayer of faith
[33:40] that everybody was going to be covered
[33:42] everybody was going to be they're going
[33:44] to get the best grades this year I
[33:46] believe than they ever have got before
[33:47] if they'll just let the Lord do it okay
[33:50] I believe that
[33:54] so in the Old Testament he's always a
[33:56] figure for the time then present in
[33:58] which we're offered both gifts and
[33:59] sacrifices that could not make him that
[34:02] did the service perfect
[34:04] so pertaining to the conscious
[34:07] and then we continue on but Christ being
[34:10] coming High Priests of good things to
[34:11] come by a greater more perfect
[34:12] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[34:15] to say not of this building what was it
[34:17] he's talking about his body
[34:18] neither by the blood of goats and cows
[34:20] but by his own blood he entered him once
[34:22] into the holy place where Calvary
[34:26] he went to Calvary and then he died and
[34:28] they put him in a tomb and he when he
[34:29] come out of that tomb that was a perfect
[34:32] Tabernacle that's exactly I come from
[34:35] God I go to God all power and Heavener
[34:37] has been given unto me he come to a
[34:40] position listen he didn't say that any
[34:42] time during his life
[34:44] he can steal the water he could steal
[34:46] the storm he can make water into wine he
[34:49] could do a lot of those things but he
[34:51] never stood and said all power and
[34:52] Heaven and Earth has been given unto me
[34:55] because he had to die first
[34:57] he had to die to release that life so
[35:00] that we can have a savior that died
[35:03] a God that died for me
[35:06] and resurrected and then was able to not
[35:09] just go somewhere and sit down under a
[35:11] tree and say okay I got it and you're
[35:12] not getting any no he died for me and
[35:15] you
[35:16] that's why I love brother Brown he said
[35:17] never forget Calvary I don't care if you
[35:19] can preach the seals that plagues the
[35:21] miles Daniel 70 weeks which we haven't
[35:24] covered over and over but if you ever
[35:26] forget who you came from if you ever
[35:27] forget Calvary you're in trouble you
[35:30] forgot it the first place you need to go
[35:31] back
[35:32] all right
[35:33] need the blood of goats and calves but
[35:35] by his own blood he entered him once
[35:37] into the holy Place having obtained look
[35:39] he obtained Eternal Redemption for us
[35:42] remember the quote that always stumbles
[35:44] people in adoption series he brother
[35:46] Brown said Jesus didn't come to bring
[35:47] you an inheritance
[35:53] your inheritance was before the
[35:54] foundation of the war it was Genesis 1
[35:56] 26 that was your inheritance he brought
[35:58] you away back to get to that inheritance
[36:01] because remember he said your
[36:03] inheritance was first
[36:05] it was barred there was no way it could
[36:07] happen anymore that Genesis 1 26 and 27
[36:10] man was bottled up in Jesus Christ
[36:13] and there was no way to get out until
[36:15] the testator died
[36:17] right because remember the Testament is
[36:20] not enforced and we'll read it right
[36:21] here
[36:22] um
[36:23] and for this cause he is a mediator of
[36:26] the New Testament that by means of death
[36:28] for the Redemption of the transgression
[36:30] that were under the first testament
[36:31] which are called they which are called
[36:34] might receive the promise of Eternal
[36:37] inheritance all right I like Eternal
[36:40] inheritance there's inheritances that
[36:42] come down here on the earth it's very
[36:44] temporal
[36:45] even gifts are temporal amen for what a
[36:49] testament is there must also necessity
[36:51] be the death of the testator for a
[36:53] testament is of force after men are dead
[36:56] otherwise it has no strength
[36:59] and there's no strength while the man
[37:00] standing there but when that man dies
[37:02] and goes away but the promise for him to
[37:04] come back it wasn't that the lamb died
[37:07] and you never saw the lamb anymore
[37:08] because that lamb Saul never or Spirit
[37:11] never could come back on you
[37:13] into you and change you make you
[37:16] different
[37:18] that's why Moses and all the different
[37:20] ones had power they had an anointing
[37:22] without the Holy Ghost without the
[37:23] character of the Holy Ghost and they did
[37:26] what they did and then as brother Bob
[37:28] was talking about Sunday and and many
[37:31] many times we went through this but
[37:32] there was a promise given
[37:35] in Genesis 3 15 he said I'll put enmity
[37:38] in other words he said you're going to
[37:41] have children you're going to be
[37:43] sorrowful you're going to have to live
[37:45] under your husband talking about the
[37:47] wife you're going to bring children in
[37:49] sorrow and man you're going to have to
[37:51] dig the ground by the sweat of your brow
[37:53] and from ashes you came from or dust you
[37:56] came from from dust you going back
[37:59] if he'd have left it at that we'd have
[38:00] no hope
[38:01] but he didn't he said but I
[38:04] will put enmity
[38:07] I'll put enmity between the seed of the
[38:09] woman in your seed in other words I'm
[38:10] coming back as the seed of the woman
[38:13] that's the promise I'm going to bring
[38:15] you even the promise of Joel that I'll
[38:18] pour out my spirit on All Flesh was not
[38:21] that he was going to put the Holy Ghost
[38:22] in every person but it was available for
[38:25] every person to have if they wanted it
[38:27] all right get by with me on that all
[38:29] right that wasn't the promise there was
[38:31] a promise everybody was going to get an
[38:33] opportunity but the promise was not that
[38:35] every person that just breathes a breath
[38:37] of life is going to get the Holy Ghost
[38:40] amen
[38:42] so there is a special group of people
[38:45] there is a special group of people
[38:47] that's going to get the new birth
[38:50] look God God having provided some better
[38:53] thing for us now wait a minute
[38:56] he provided some pretty good stuff in
[38:58] that Old Testament
[39:00] he provided all these different prophets
[39:03] to prophesy and do Great Mighty wonders
[39:06] and part of c and and living a well and
[39:09] do all these different things and and
[39:11] come out on the end of a flood that's
[39:13] pretty powerful
[39:15] but God said he provided something
[39:17] better for me and you
[39:19] which was what that we could walk around
[39:21] on this Earth with the Holy Ghost in our
[39:23] soul
[39:24] and be moved and directed by that Holy
[39:27] Ghost not just an anointing come on us
[39:28] and then we're just you know a ranked
[39:30] center after that no
[39:32] God haven't provided some better things
[39:34] for us that they without us should not
[39:38] be made perfect so somewhere they are
[39:40] not complete whatever you all think
[39:43] that's your business I'm just going to
[39:45] tell you I don't think they got a
[39:47] glorified body because to me that's the
[39:49] epitome that's the Apex when we come to
[39:51] The Headstone and we are changed in the
[39:54] moment and twinkling of an eye we have
[39:56] reached that full promise
[40:00] and we're bringing a whole group with us
[40:04] we're bringing ages
[40:07] with us
[40:09] ages of people that have waited the
[40:12] prophets even Jesus stood and he said
[40:14] all these prophets they yearned to see
[40:17] this day
[40:18] and they didn't
[40:20] but you're looking at it well guess what
[40:22] is Jesus Christ not back again
[40:24] then you're looking at it
[40:26] you're looking at the day he talked
[40:28] about the day of the Lord
[40:30] then Acts 2 38 tells us number one you
[40:33] got to do is repent
[40:35] and then be baptized everyone in the
[40:37] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[40:39] of your sin and you shall receive the
[40:40] gift of the Holy Ghost
[40:43] for the promise
[40:46] what the promise of the Holy Ghost
[40:48] in your soul
[40:49] isn't to you to your children to all
[40:52] that are far off even as many as the
[40:54] Lord Our God shall call and he's still
[40:57] calling
[40:58] he's still calling
[41:00] he's still calling people to repentance
[41:02] to give them that promise all right
[41:06] because somebody's going to be Kings and
[41:07] Priests because that's what the Bible
[41:08] said right
[41:10] Blasphemous names brother Brown said
[41:12] look now I believe that the reasons
[41:14] there's so much confusion today about
[41:15] the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught
[41:18] I believe it's the baptism it's taught
[41:20] just say the baptism well see that would
[41:22] be just like I said automobile you know
[41:24] but there's plenty of them there's a lot
[41:25] of different ones there's different
[41:26] parts that go in that automobile all
[41:28] right same thing and they work different
[41:30] but the Holy Ghost said look now when
[41:32] you talk about the baptism of the Holy
[41:34] Spirit there's a lot goes with that so
[41:37] it's not just God dumping on you as you
[41:39] got to go through justification
[41:41] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[41:44] Ghost you know and sanctification we'll
[41:46] get to it in a minute you know we talk
[41:48] about the unclean Spirit going out we
[41:49] talk about uh I didn't find that quote
[41:51] but I need to find it where brother
[41:52] Brown says he says that your name goes
[41:54] on the book it's sanctification as a
[41:56] Believer all right so you start because
[41:58] in justification what are you doing
[41:59] you're believing on the Lord Jesus
[42:01] Christ and he saves you and that's about
[42:03] it
[42:05] that's just it you're in a place where
[42:07] God you forgive me but
[42:09] I'm still wandering around here because
[42:11] remember that same Spirit hadn't even
[42:13] left the house yet
[42:15] and Luke it's left the house
[42:18] and sanctification in justification is
[42:20] still there tormenting you every day
[42:22] that's the tough that's a tough part to
[42:24] get over
[42:25] all right but if you'll let God do it
[42:28] it'll be an easy part
[42:30] and when you talk about the baptism of
[42:32] the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with
[42:33] that huh see there's a lot goes with
[42:36] that and here's what I think that God is
[42:38] proving is that the Holy Spirit
[42:41] is here
[42:42] that's what I said we we've got to come
[42:45] to a conclusion somewhere that the Holy
[42:47] Ghost inside of me and you is right
[42:51] and everything else is wrong
[42:55] see because they're coming to the
[42:56] conclusion on the belief assigned people
[42:57] that the Holy Ghost is in them and
[42:59] that's what's correct and everybody else
[43:01] is wrong
[43:02] well there's got to be something
[43:03] somewhere as brother Brown said there's
[43:06] got to be an absolute so if if we need
[43:09] to look for another absolute
[43:11] please Lord we've wasted 60 something
[43:14] years by listening to his tapes and
[43:16] books and and and preaching this message
[43:18] if you if it's what they say that
[43:21] brother Brown was a liar and you don't
[43:23] you know I mean come on
[43:25] How could a man stand that had been to
[43:28] Hell
[43:30] twice
[43:32] he stands one day and he says I'll be
[43:35] held accountable
[43:37] if I'm lying to you
[43:41] stand there that you can't deny that's
[43:43] what I want to tell him one day ever I
[43:45] don't really don't somebody's tried to
[43:47] you know talk to him but there's really
[43:48] no sense in trying to talk to him only
[43:51] God can help them
[43:52] but but you see there had to be
[43:54] something Supernatural in brother around
[43:56] his life he couldn't go through 50
[43:57] something years and keep all this lined
[44:00] up
[44:01] and be able to look in another dimension
[44:03] and go into and tell the truth at least
[44:06] they listen at least he did tell the
[44:08] truth when he was in another dimension
[44:10] when he was talking to somebody and said
[44:12] you're from so and so on you they can't
[44:13] deny that
[44:15] they can't right so he has been in
[44:17] another region that me and you have not
[44:19] been in and they have not been in
[44:24] he was in a place and he saw death he
[44:26] saw hell he saw all those hideous things
[44:28] why in the world would he stand in the
[44:30] Pulpit knowing that's where he's going
[44:31] if he's trying to lie to people oh I
[44:34] just don't get it
[44:36] hmm
[44:38] so let's continue on thereby all right
[44:40] brother Ryan said things that are to be
[44:43] he said now the only way that you can be
[44:44] a son and daughter of God now look you
[44:46] have to have eternal life
[44:48] now here's a quote I want to bring you
[44:50] this one then I'll bring you another one
[44:52] because
[44:54] some read this in the message that you
[44:56] come here with eternal life now that's a
[44:58] belief now brother Bob he knows for a
[45:00] fact I've sat and talked to him so is he
[45:03] so it's not a it's not hearsay they
[45:05] literally believe that you came here
[45:07] with some kind of form seed spot dot of
[45:11] eternal life in your soul somewhere
[45:13] right brother Aaron has to we've all
[45:15] we've all met them because it's
[45:16] prevalent in the message
[45:18] because they take these quotes and they
[45:20] twist them around but I want you to
[45:22] listen to this
[45:23] now the only way that you can be now
[45:25] watch
[45:26] why didn't he say well you already a son
[45:29] and daughter of God
[45:30] he starts out right here telling you
[45:32] that the only way you can be
[45:35] our son and daughter forgot because you
[45:37] have to you have to have eternal life
[45:40] and there's only one form of eternal
[45:43] life and that's God's life
[45:45] only one form of eternal life that was
[45:47] God there to be a son of God
[45:51] you had to be in him always not a doubt
[45:54] that Genesis 1 26 man did not develop
[45:58] over time it was in eternity with God
[46:00] but it was in the mind of God it was not
[46:03] a little seed running around in his
[46:05] loins like we do as men to have children
[46:07] everybody with me on that it's not a
[46:09] little dot or a little spot
[46:12] it's by predestination by him seeing by
[46:16] foreknowledge that you would come here
[46:17] and want it
[46:18] and he had it for you
[46:20] now look watch
[46:22] to be a Son of God you had to be in him
[46:25] always in him
[46:28] not him and you
[46:31] praise God
[46:33] we wouldn't need salvation if he was
[46:35] always in US
[46:37] if we came here with us in him
[46:40] he did
[46:42] but we didn't come here with him and us
[46:45] we come here with a potential
[46:47] we come here with with um as brother
[46:50] Brown says the woman at the well she had
[46:52] representation
[46:54] in other words when God stood out there
[46:56] in Genesis 1 26 and he's let us make man
[46:59] our own image there was a group of
[47:01] people that was that was formulated in
[47:03] his mind
[47:04] called your name in my name there was no
[47:07] place that it began though
[47:11] if you had a beginning
[47:13] in that part
[47:16] you are dead
[47:20] because Adolf Hitler
[47:22] had a part in that
[47:24] he was in the thoughts of God but not
[47:27] the Eternal section
[47:28] that Genesis 1 26 man is the Eternal
[47:31] section of the Book of Life
[47:33] all right not just the Book of Life not
[47:35] the whole book it's a section of the
[47:37] book
[47:39] now watch the gene of your life now
[47:41] watch the gene of your life that you're
[47:44] sitting in today came from your parents
[47:49] y'all can say Amen anytime you want to
[47:52] okay the gene of your life that I'm
[47:55] looking at came from an act between your
[47:58] father and your mother that was this
[47:59] released and that came down and
[48:02] right right
[48:03] and then God give you a soul
[48:06] right
[48:07] and as we read the quote before you were
[48:10] born lost
[48:11] you were born in a way that God never
[48:14] intended for you to be born
[48:17] right
[48:18] all right born in sin shaping iniquity I
[48:21] read all that
[48:22] but now look the gene of your life comma
[48:26] spiritual life
[48:28] Now we move it over
[48:31] right it's not what Mom and Daddy
[48:33] brought it's not that genetics that
[48:35] God's that brother around talking about
[48:38] now watch the gene of your life
[48:40] spiritual life tonight was in God so he
[48:44] separated it
[48:46] himself
[48:48] from the genetics you have now to the
[48:51] gene seed that you were before the
[48:52] foundation of the world and by with me
[48:55] okay I want you to get this because you
[48:58] will hear this
[48:59] I'll probably hear it this weekend sadly
[49:03] the gene of your life your spiritual
[49:05] life now that's your spiritual life
[49:08] tonight was in God the Father before
[49:12] there was even a molecule
[49:14] now listen your stinking body was not
[49:20] there's a separation
[49:22] he's talking about the gene seed of your
[49:25] Eternal part that was in the mind of God
[49:27] the Genesis 1 26 man all right
[49:31] was in God the Father before there was
[49:33] even a molecule see look and you are
[49:37] nothing but the manifestation of the
[49:40] gene life that was in God as a Son of
[49:43] God now look
[49:45] and you're expressed look
[49:49] after
[49:55] after his word come in you
[49:58] now if you always had it why was there
[49:59] an after
[50:02] huh
[50:04] uh we believe brother Brown was a
[50:05] prophet right we believe all the quotes
[50:07] every one of them we got to take them
[50:08] all they you know you can take certain
[50:10] over here and make your Doctrine correct
[50:12] but you got to take every one of them
[50:13] that's what I've always liked about
[50:15] brother Dale he would take every quote
[50:17] that seemed contrary and ever quote that
[50:19] was that was uh we believe in this but
[50:22] now I don't know about this but he'd
[50:24] take both of them put them right
[50:24] together
[50:27] that's what we told them at the meeting
[50:28] one time you know about Daniel 70 weeks
[50:30] we said look we can take both all these
[50:32] quotes and put them together you have to
[50:34] totally deny this whole book over here
[50:37] to make your Doctrine right it might
[50:39] most of y'all some of y'all were there
[50:42] you have to deny these quotes how can
[50:45] you deny a quote
[50:48] that's like denying the Bible
[50:52] look you are expressing no I'm sorry
[50:54] after his word has come in you
[50:58] to light up this age
[51:03] you are expressing God's life in you now
[51:07] listen you were not expressing God's
[51:10] life when you were a sinner
[51:14] I'm not even going to ask you did you
[51:16] I'm going to tell you you didn't
[51:20] but there was representation in God not
[51:23] in you
[51:30] you are expressing God's life in you now
[51:33] look he's saying now after the words
[51:35] come in you
[51:37] you are expressing God's life in you
[51:39] because you are a son and daughter of
[51:41] God therefore you get what I mean
[51:43] congregation says amen I doubt that a
[51:45] lot of them
[51:46] teach what they teach you are it now
[51:49] look you are now made
[51:52] you're sitting in this church tonight
[51:55] because your duty is to express God to
[51:58] this nation and this people and this
[52:02] neighborhood where you associate watch
[52:04] wherever you are God knew
[52:09] by foreknowledge
[52:11] God knew that you would be here
[52:15] because you have to be one of his genes
[52:18] or his attributes
[52:23] okay then by with me you had to be what
[52:26] if you were there
[52:29] watch
[52:30] if you ever
[52:32] if you've got eternal life
[52:35] he wasn't talking to the sinner
[52:37] he was talking to people they were born
[52:39] again
[52:41] if you ever if you've got eternal life
[52:44] then it always was eternal life well
[52:47] sure
[52:49] you had a natural life that was dying
[52:54] but you had a soul inside of you that
[52:57] was yearning for God and when God burned
[52:59] that old nature out he put what he put
[53:01] that Genesis 1 26.
[53:03] eternal life inside of you
[53:05] to me that makes it so simple and that
[53:07] is the Plan of Salvation I was lost now
[53:10] I'm found
[53:11] there is no Plan of Salvation if he
[53:13] always was eternal and all of a sudden
[53:14] you just figured out who you are
[53:17] that takes away justification takes away
[53:19] sanctification
[53:22] you know what I mean but it's very
[53:23] prevalent so be careful
[53:27] I just I don't deny that I was lost
[53:31] I don't deny that the things I did God
[53:34] might have been around somewhere but he
[53:36] had a great big Shield up
[53:38] and he was looking through the blood he
[53:40] was not looking to his his eyes because
[53:43] they would have been very angry but he
[53:45] was looking to a shield of blood knowing
[53:47] that one day he would hear my
[53:49] he'd hear my voice through that blood
[53:52] he said oh I knew you would
[53:56] if I present it to you I knew you would
[53:58] because I saw you before the foundation
[54:00] of the world
[54:01] [Applause]
[54:04] that's much better than him just picking
[54:06] and going now I'll take you
[54:08] and not you I'm I've got one for you but
[54:11] I don't have one for you sorry
[54:13] uh and and you're you're getting one
[54:15] whether you want it or not no that only
[54:17] the way God is now we know brother Brown
[54:19] taught us that's not what God did
[54:22] and he didn't put us in the tube and
[54:24] post through
[54:25] right that's not predestination
[54:27] predestination is predetermined by
[54:29] foreknowledge he sought what you do
[54:31] therefore he could predestinate to me
[54:33] that's very simple
[54:35] now look if you've got eternal life then
[54:37] it it oh it always was eternal life well
[54:39] you can't make it not
[54:43] and God before there was a foundation
[54:45] world look knew that you would be here
[54:49] by what four
[54:51] somebody say it for acknowledge
[54:55] knowing all things now watch
[55:00] here's the kicker
[55:03] and when the word
[55:05] or the water the washing of water of the
[55:08] word
[55:09] fell upon you
[55:11] I thought you already had it
[55:15] when it fell upon you it was expressed
[55:19] in a being
[55:22] now you have fellowship with your father
[55:25] God just as you have with your Earthly
[55:29] father
[55:30] see you are citizens of the king not
[55:33] citizens but you are children Sons and
[55:35] Daughters of God of the Living God look
[55:38] if
[55:40] it be
[55:41] let eternal life dwells in you
[55:45] to me that's so simple
[55:48] Ezekiel 36 now we've been through this
[55:51] we'll go through it just for a few
[55:52] minutes
[56:01] you've been you've been like and see I
[56:03] tried my I look at myself with Israel
[56:05] because remember
[56:07] our first husband was not God
[56:12] our first husband was the devil
[56:14] and he had to die
[56:18] that we can what be reborn
[56:23] through Christ
[56:25] now look the house of Israel but from my
[56:27] holy namesake which you have profaned
[56:30] among the heaven Heathen wherever you
[56:33] went
[56:34] that's me
[56:36] and I will sanctify my great name which
[56:39] was profaned among the Heathen who's the
[56:42] Heathen us which you have profaned in
[56:46] the midst of them and that Heathen shall
[56:48] know that I am the Lord saith the Lord
[56:50] God when I shall be Sanctified in you
[56:54] the only God they're ever going to see
[56:56] is you
[56:58] before their eyes for I will take you
[57:00] from among the Heathen now look hold on
[57:03] he's separating now
[57:05] I'm gonna take you from the Heathen and
[57:08] gather you out of all countries
[57:11] and will bring you into your own land
[57:13] what is Our Land like I said Sunday our
[57:16] land is not
[57:17] a piece of property
[57:19] our land is not a piece of dirt but it
[57:22] is a piece of dirt
[57:23] your dirt you walked in here with it
[57:26] you walked in here with your city your
[57:28] possession you walked in here with your
[57:31] land today
[57:34] so I will bring you into your own land
[57:36] then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[57:38] you and you shall be claimed praise God
[57:41] from all your filthiness and from all
[57:44] your Idols we all had them
[57:47] will I cleanse you a new heart also will
[57:50] I give you now here's your journey
[57:52] here's justification he's going to give
[57:54] you a new heart because man you had a
[57:56] Stony heart
[57:58] you didn't care about God you didn't
[57:59] care about nobody
[58:01] maybe your own self
[58:04] and a new spirit now he's going to give
[58:05] you a new heart
[58:07] and a new spirit
[58:09] now that's not the Holy Spirit
[58:11] but it is part of your journey
[58:14] and by with me all right stay away
[58:17] and a new spirit will thou put now look
[58:19] within you because remember when he puts
[58:22] that Spirit he's talking about which is
[58:25] not the Holy Spirit
[58:27] but it is a spirit from God and even
[58:29] brother Brown says he gives you a new
[58:31] spirit
[58:32] so that you can what live with your own
[58:35] self that's what he said all right and
[58:37] that God can live with you
[58:39] so what does he do when he gives you a
[58:41] new spirit now in sanctification how do
[58:44] you get that new spirit will it read in
[58:46] just a minute you're Washed by the Water
[58:47] of the word that's why you can be
[58:49] justified and not be sanctified
[58:53] you can be justified believe on the Lord
[58:55] Jesus Christ come right here he'll
[58:56] forgive you your sins right that's a
[58:59] promise
[59:02] but now when you get up
[59:05] and you go out that door
[59:07] you still got that same guy in you
[59:12] that made you do the things you just got
[59:15] rid of
[59:17] thank God for teaching of the prophet
[59:18] and brother Dale and and the brothers
[59:21] were associated with all of us
[59:24] because I knew then insane justification
[59:26] I was I was just beginning I was just I
[59:29] was just right at the place to where God
[59:31] could use me or could could you know
[59:34] wait a minute God finds you not you'd
[59:36] find God God found you right you just
[59:39] made yourself available right all right
[59:41] so I made myself available but you know
[59:43] what I did I didn't say well bless God I
[59:45] got it and y'all didn't see me for
[59:46] another three years two years
[59:48] no I knew then I had to come
[59:51] I had to sit and let the water wash me
[59:57] I had to let that thing
[1:00:00] push
[1:00:01] that unclean Spirit out
[1:00:04] of course well look he said I'll put in
[1:00:06] my a new spirit not not the Holy Spirit
[1:00:09] a new spirit within you
[1:00:12] so when that Spirit comes in brother
[1:00:14] George
[1:00:15] now them demons I ain't talking about
[1:00:18] yours know about mine and everybody
[1:00:19] else's
[1:00:20] they don't go and say
[1:00:23] here's a basket of fruit thank you for
[1:00:25] letting me stay at your house
[1:00:29] no he looks at you and he says I'll be
[1:00:31] back buddy
[1:00:32] I like this place this is my house
[1:00:35] that's what the Bible says it says calls
[1:00:37] it his house
[1:00:40] when the unclean Spirit goes out the
[1:00:42] devil says I'm going back to my house
[1:00:45] I felt comfortable in there you have
[1:00:47] made me totally uncomfortable
[1:00:49] that's what happens when you're sitting
[1:00:51] here and you do a nest at church
[1:00:58] some of you
[1:01:03] you don't you don't need discernment
[1:01:05] when you start hitting somebody's
[1:01:07] soul
[1:01:10] and a lot of times
[1:01:13] and got that door
[1:01:15] but if you'll sit here long enough he'll
[1:01:17] promised us
[1:01:19] he'll give us a new spirit
[1:01:21] and that Spirit though is a holy spirit
[1:01:23] now I said it wasn't but it is you
[1:01:25] understand what I mean it's not the Holy
[1:01:26] Spirit to birth you
[1:01:28] but it is the Holy Spirit to push
[1:01:32] because remember can't be two in there
[1:01:34] at the same time devil and God so you
[1:01:36] got to push him out so so that spirit is
[1:01:38] going to come in and push him out by
[1:01:39] what by the word
[1:01:41] by you studying like you didn't study
[1:01:43] before like you come to church like you
[1:01:45] didn't ever come to church before
[1:01:47] all right
[1:01:49] pushes it out
[1:01:52] but remember he don't lock the door yet
[1:01:56] because you got some work to do
[1:01:59] unclean Spirit goes out all right
[1:02:02] I will take away the Stony heart out of
[1:02:05] your flesh and give you
[1:02:08] a heart of Flesh why because your heart
[1:02:10] was
[1:02:10] mad
[1:02:13] upset
[1:02:18] anger at the world anger at the preacher
[1:02:21] greet everybody
[1:02:25] but I'll give you a heart of Flesh in
[1:02:26] other words so I can reach in there and
[1:02:28] be like the Potter
[1:02:31] be like the Potter I can Mash that thing
[1:02:33] down and I can remake the pot
[1:02:35] and you know how you make a pot you make
[1:02:37] it from the inside out
[1:02:38] when you put that thing down the wheel
[1:02:40] you start punching in first and then you
[1:02:42] pull it up
[1:02:45] from the inside out and you know what it
[1:02:47] takes if you watch a Potter it takes
[1:02:49] water
[1:02:50] they keep having to throw water why
[1:02:52] because it wants you wet they don't want
[1:02:53] you a dry Christian
[1:02:55] he don't want you to sit here and go
[1:02:58] that's right
[1:03:00] no wait a minute
[1:03:10] some of y'all raise your hand you'd have
[1:03:11] to go to the chiropractor to get it put
[1:03:13] back down
[1:03:16] well you get happy about other stuff you
[1:03:18] might as well get a happy about the Lord
[1:03:19] I was somewhere the other day and I'm
[1:03:21] like
[1:03:22] wow yeah wow
[1:03:25] have you ever had a wild moment
[1:03:27] and it wasn't when the blue lights were
[1:03:29] in your rear view mirror
[1:03:33] we talked about that Sunday we won't
[1:03:34] talk about that no more
[1:03:38] so he pushes out the unclean spirit
[1:03:43] you start coming to church brother Brian
[1:03:45] said your name goes on the book as a as
[1:03:47] a as a religious person or a religious
[1:03:49] order that's what happened to Judas
[1:03:52] do you know literally there was an
[1:03:53] unclean Spirit pushed out of Judas
[1:03:55] because brother Brown said Judas was
[1:03:57] under sanctification
[1:03:58] so there was an unclean Spirit pushed
[1:04:00] out but what happened
[1:04:02] he may not have believed who Jesus
[1:04:04] really was
[1:04:07] and the devil came right back in
[1:04:09] and said let's get him
[1:04:13] let's get him
[1:04:16] so don't let that happen don't stay in
[1:04:18] sanctification so long that you just
[1:04:21] become
[1:04:22] religious
[1:04:25] religious
[1:04:30] because when the unclean Spirit goes out
[1:04:34] I mean we all know
[1:04:36] some of us
[1:04:38] clean house better than others
[1:04:40] but that's okay never has bothered me
[1:04:42] one way or the other
[1:04:44] but but have you ever you know you you
[1:04:46] put on a clean pair of clothes you've
[1:04:48] been out working all day you know
[1:04:50] Greece everywhere
[1:04:51] and you clean yourself up wash yourself
[1:04:53] up
[1:04:55] scour up real good put you on a good set
[1:04:57] of clothes
[1:04:58] don't you feel better
[1:05:01] that's the same way it should be in
[1:05:02] sanctification you should feel better
[1:05:04] you should feel that there's a load been
[1:05:06] lifted off of you you should feel that
[1:05:08] that that Lord now
[1:05:11] start working on me
[1:05:13] because he didn't work on your in
[1:05:15] justification because they were still
[1:05:16] that unclean Spirit there saying nah
[1:05:18] ain't letting you in
[1:05:19] but when you start coming to church and
[1:05:21] you start doing the things of God and
[1:05:23] you started trying
[1:05:26] to do better you're going to fail
[1:05:29] everybody's gonna fail because remember
[1:05:30] those unclean spirits are going to come
[1:05:32] back
[1:05:34] but get up and go again
[1:05:38] listen listen I thank God this is not a
[1:05:41] one and done thing
[1:05:43] I like that person called Grace now not
[1:05:47] greasy Grace but I like Grace
[1:05:49] because Grace gives you a chance
[1:05:52] in your Fallen condition
[1:05:55] so he's going to give you a heart of
[1:05:57] Flesh in other words so he can start
[1:05:58] working on you
[1:05:59] and you can start raising your hands and
[1:06:01] if you were all old crusty old thing and
[1:06:04] you never smiled and you never got happy
[1:06:07] and the world was always against you and
[1:06:10] you know you hated everybody and
[1:06:12] everybody hated you but boy when you
[1:06:15] come under sanctification I'm talking
[1:06:17] about me you you take your whatever
[1:06:19] experience you got
[1:06:21] it's like man
[1:06:25] this is good
[1:06:28] and you know what helped me more than
[1:06:29] anything
[1:06:30] I was in a support group you're talking
[1:06:32] about a support group
[1:06:34] when you come among believers
[1:06:36] that have the new birth that know what
[1:06:39] you're talking about
[1:06:41] and says I can help you if you need any
[1:06:44] help to me that's the greatest thing
[1:06:46] you'll ever get I don't know how to you
[1:06:48] cannot become a Christian and isolate
[1:06:50] yourself
[1:06:53] you know who isolates you right
[1:06:56] divide and conquer
[1:06:57] the devil divides you from the fold and
[1:07:02] he will kill you
[1:07:05] but now watch then he said I will put I
[1:07:07] who God I
[1:07:09] I will put my spirit now here we go
[1:07:13] I will put my spirit within you and
[1:07:17] cause you
[1:07:20] in other words
[1:07:21] in sanctification and I'll just go and
[1:07:24] say this and even in justification a lot
[1:07:26] of your sisters
[1:07:28] you rebelled against not cutting your
[1:07:30] hair
[1:07:31] you rebelled against I know some of you
[1:07:33] come in and it was like oh I I see that
[1:07:36] but something didn't some of you still
[1:07:38] have a problem now but um
[1:07:43] well you can get quiet if you want to I
[1:07:44] can see it I'm not stupid
[1:07:46] I can see pain on the face and I can see
[1:07:48] fingernails and I can see this and that
[1:07:50] and the other you need to stop it or you
[1:07:52] well you've been taught long enough
[1:07:56] and I'll put my spirit within you and
[1:07:58] cause you to walk in my statutes so when
[1:08:01] you get the new birth it becomes a joy
[1:08:04] it becomes a joy
[1:08:06] for for sister Jean not to cut her hair
[1:08:09] becomes a joy for her not to wear pants
[1:08:11] it becomes a joy for all of you to be
[1:08:14] the sisters
[1:08:16] and the men be the brothers
[1:08:18] it's a joy this should be a joy so I
[1:08:21] said you should be happy if you're not
[1:08:24] happy that unclean Spirit has come back
[1:08:26] and it is tormenting you and tormenting
[1:08:29] you and tormenting you
[1:08:31] kick that guy out
[1:08:37] by the washing of the law of the world
[1:08:39] that's why when we get in trouble
[1:08:43] don't leave the flock right
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:49] I don't care if none of them likes you
[1:08:52] and you don't like know them if that's
[1:08:54] true you need to find another crowd
[1:08:56] right
[1:08:59] but the board struggled a lot
[1:09:02] I kind of walked through his journey
[1:09:03] with him right
[1:09:05] he struggled a lot
[1:09:07] I say a lot we all have a lot that we
[1:09:09] struggle with he struggles with certain
[1:09:11] things I struggle with certain things
[1:09:12] right
[1:09:14] but he persevered
[1:09:16] he never left the fold
[1:09:18] he never disappeared
[1:09:20] and that's okay about yours I'm not you
[1:09:22] know I'm talking about you
[1:09:24] you know I'm talking about you you know
[1:09:26] brother I'm I'm talking about you but
[1:09:28] you know that right I love you man
[1:09:32] you're back you're here
[1:09:34] but don't leave
[1:09:35] listen cling on to something
[1:09:41] talk to somebody
[1:09:45] I better not
[1:09:47] you know when somebody leaves the church
[1:09:52] don't let them just drift out in the
[1:09:54] ocean I don't know why this is
[1:09:58] foreign
[1:10:02] okay
[1:10:05] so I call Bro George
[1:10:08] and I'd have kept calling him till he
[1:10:10] answered and I'd have found where he
[1:10:11] lived and I'd have found him
[1:10:13] why because I went after somebody
[1:10:16] you need to go after somebody amen
[1:10:22] June left the church all them years ago
[1:10:24] this church
[1:10:26] long time ago nobody ever called her
[1:10:29] to see why
[1:10:30] nobody
[1:10:32] hmm sister Gail Addison did I'm sorry
[1:10:35] one person
[1:10:36] that's not good
[1:10:38] that's not good
[1:10:40] he said well you know if they don't want
[1:10:42] to get in their business
[1:10:43] I'm in the business of saving people
[1:10:46] I'm in a business of helping people's
[1:10:48] lives all right that's my business
[1:10:50] that's what I get if I get paid that's
[1:10:52] what I get paid for
[1:10:54] I don't get paid to just make you feel
[1:10:55] good
[1:10:59] if I did we'd have all kinds we'd have
[1:11:00] popcorn and we'd do fireworks and we'd
[1:11:03] make ice cream and all that stuff
[1:11:04] during service
[1:11:06] kids calm down we're not gonna do that
[1:11:10] but it's not it's for saving Souls
[1:11:14] and you start drifting out guess what's
[1:11:16] going to happen the devil's going to get
[1:11:18] a hold of you because I promise you
[1:11:21] God's not the one that sent you out
[1:11:23] there
[1:11:27] God said come here
[1:11:30] come to me
[1:11:31] all that are heavy
[1:11:34] burdened
[1:11:36] come unto me don't leave me
[1:11:39] and then he's told us he never leave us
[1:11:41] or forsake us
[1:11:43] just life lesson
[1:11:45] somebody disappears let's find them all
[1:11:47] right
[1:11:51] and I will put my spirit now that my
[1:11:54] spirit is God
[1:11:56] all right that is what brother Brown was
[1:11:59] talking about the eternal life there's
[1:12:00] only one form and that's eternal life
[1:12:03] and that emanates from God Almighty all
[1:12:05] right everybody with me all right so now
[1:12:08] this we know that this is the burner
[1:12:11] this is the Holy Ghost in fire that
[1:12:13] they're talking about when Jesus is
[1:12:15] telling them go to the
[1:12:17] Upper Room in other words until you be
[1:12:19] endued with power from on high this is
[1:12:22] that power and look and cause you
[1:12:25] to love to come to church cause you to
[1:12:28] love to study cause you to love to live
[1:12:31] a good Christian Life cause you to be a
[1:12:34] better person to be a better Christian
[1:12:36] in front of your employees or employer
[1:12:39] are different or whatever you want to
[1:12:41] say
[1:12:42] and you shall my judgments and do them
[1:12:44] look
[1:12:47] that didn't say begrudgingly but they
[1:12:50] didn't say I'm going to beat you to do
[1:12:51] them
[1:12:52] you shall keep my judgments
[1:12:55] and do them
[1:12:58] it's not like what the preacher said the
[1:12:59] other day he said you do not have to beg
[1:13:01] a Christian to keep coming to church
[1:13:06] you don't
[1:13:07] the other ones you do but the Christians
[1:13:10] you don't
[1:13:11] Romans 5 verse 1 says therefore being
[1:13:13] justified by what faith this is all
[1:13:15] based on faith that's based on
[1:13:17] everything's based on faith
[1:13:19] how many of you saw Jesus down across
[1:13:22] how many of you saw him resurrect
[1:13:28] then you got to have it by faith
[1:13:31] you've got to have this whole thing as
[1:13:33] based brother Brown said this whole
[1:13:34] thing is Facebook based on faith
[1:13:36] believing that what I'm telling you that
[1:13:39] a man did two thousand years ago is the
[1:13:41] truth
[1:13:43] it's just sure as we're sitting here
[1:13:45] today
[1:13:46] but you got to believe it because
[1:13:47] there's a lot of people don't so
[1:13:49] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:13:51] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:13:53] Jesus Christ by whom also we have what
[1:13:55] access by faith
[1:13:58] into this grace where when we're with We
[1:14:01] Stand wherein we stand and rejoice and
[1:14:04] hope of the glory of God
[1:14:05] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[1:14:08] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:14:10] whosoever
[1:14:12] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:14:15] have everlasting life
[1:14:17] for God sent not his son into the world
[1:14:19] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:14:21] through him might be saved
[1:14:26] but he didn't believeth not as condemned
[1:14:28] already because he hath not believed in
[1:14:30] the name of the only begotten
[1:14:32] Son of God and then we see that water
[1:14:35] baptism is our next step
[1:14:37] then sanctification where we were
[1:14:39] talking about giving a new heart
[1:14:42] for this is the will of God even your
[1:14:44] sanctification Now look for this is the
[1:14:46] will of God
[1:14:48] right even your sanctification that you
[1:14:51] should abstain from fornication you say
[1:14:53] well I don't do that well that can mean
[1:14:56] a lot of things right spiritually and
[1:14:58] physically that every one of you should
[1:15:01] know how to possess his vessel now
[1:15:04] when the unclean Spirit goes out
[1:15:08] see that's a new that's a new thing to
[1:15:10] you
[1:15:11] everybody listen just for a minute
[1:15:13] that's a new thing to you
[1:15:16] you were comfortable with what you did
[1:15:19] before
[1:15:21] you could go buy a six-pack and not have
[1:15:23] to look around everybody and make sure
[1:15:25] the cameras didn't get you in nobody you
[1:15:27] know your neighbor didn't come in right
[1:15:29] you just didn't go there anymore you
[1:15:31] didn't even feel comfortable
[1:15:38] that every one of you should know how to
[1:15:39] possess your vessel and sanctification
[1:15:41] and honor
[1:15:42] their sanctification you know how by the
[1:15:45] washing of the war of the word you know
[1:15:47] how to overcome
[1:15:51] members not watch you overcome
[1:15:54] how you overcome
[1:15:55] the situation
[1:15:57] Matthew 12 43 says when the unclean
[1:16:00] Spirit has gone out of a man he walks
[1:16:01] through Dry places seek his rest
[1:16:04] fine if none in other words he's out
[1:16:06] there where it's dry
[1:16:08] and and and he's bothered because he
[1:16:11] can't sit down inside your soul
[1:16:14] and he can't find rest and he said I
[1:16:16] will return to my house
[1:16:18] from whence I came out of
[1:16:21] and when he has come he findeth an empty
[1:16:23] swept and garnished he's like man
[1:16:25] there's room in here now
[1:16:27] so he goes and gets seven other demons
[1:16:30] more wicked than himself
[1:16:33] and they enter in and dwell there
[1:16:37] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:16:39] than the first even so shall it be also
[1:16:42] unto this wicked generation so how
[1:16:46] they're going to be Sanctified John 17
[1:16:48] says sanctify them what through thy
[1:16:50] truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent
[1:16:54] me into the world even so I have sent
[1:16:56] them into the world he did not pray
[1:16:59] brother George that that he'd take us
[1:17:01] out of the world
[1:17:02] he prayed that we would be Overcomers in
[1:17:04] the world
[1:17:05] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[1:17:09] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:17:11] through the truth
[1:17:14] First Corinthians 6 verse 9 says know
[1:17:16] you not that the unwrite you shall not
[1:17:17] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[1:17:19] deceived neither fornicators
[1:17:22] we'll let that sink in idolaters let
[1:17:25] that sink in adulterers
[1:17:27] effeminate look that word up nor abusers
[1:17:31] of themselves with mankind
[1:17:35] thieves
[1:17:37] covetous
[1:17:40] drunks
[1:17:43] don't smokers
[1:17:47] extortioners
[1:17:49] swindlers
[1:17:52] shall enter or inherit the kingdom of
[1:17:55] God
[1:17:56] all right we're done
[1:17:59] I'm gonna let that Zoom a little bit
[1:18:00] more and we'll so we're done we're
[1:18:02] finished that's it
[1:18:07] the Apostle Paul
[1:18:08] had him in his congregation too
[1:18:12] he said and such were some of you
[1:18:15] but you are washed
[1:18:18] but you are sanctified
[1:18:21] but you are justified in the name of the
[1:18:23] Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[1:18:26] of our God
[1:18:27] how powerful is it that's pretty
[1:18:30] powerful
[1:18:32] there's nothing you can do outside about
[1:18:34] a blasphemer in the Holy Ghost that you
[1:18:36] can't be delivered from
[1:18:38] come on somebody
[1:18:41] and get born again
[1:18:42] now bye with me
[1:18:46] let's go look for the birth just for a
[1:18:48] minute so he said I'm going to put my
[1:18:49] spirit and I'm gonna put my spirit
[1:18:51] within you and cause you to walk in my
[1:18:53] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[1:18:55] and do them
[1:18:57] Matthew 3 verse 11 says I indeed
[1:18:59] baptized you with water this is John but
[1:19:02] he that cometh after me is mightier than
[1:19:04] I who sow shoes
[1:19:05] I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize
[1:19:08] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[1:19:13] he's not just going to just give you the
[1:19:15] Holy Ghost he didn't just put that Lake
[1:19:16] of Fire over the top of them of the 120.
[1:19:19] that that that thing just disappeared
[1:19:21] right inside of them
[1:19:23] and it didn't go out
[1:19:28] don't think when he goes inside you it's
[1:19:30] supposed to go out
[1:19:32] no it's supposed to burn all that junk
[1:19:34] out inside of you and what keep burning
[1:19:37] keep you clean
[1:19:39] John 14 26 but the comforter which is
[1:19:42] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[1:19:44] in my name he shall teach you all things
[1:19:46] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:19:48] whatsoever I have said
[1:19:50] unto you I like what brother Jason
[1:19:52] Jackson was saying this weekend which we
[1:19:54] all go through it I mean we read a book
[1:19:56] and we listen to a tape and we we just
[1:19:58] comb through it of course ministers we
[1:20:00] come to it a little more maybe than
[1:20:01] y'all do because we're looking for
[1:20:03] something
[1:20:05] and then some other preacher gets up and
[1:20:06] preaches something else at a different
[1:20:08] angle at a different subject and he make
[1:20:10] he quotes out of that same book you've
[1:20:12] been reading for the past two weeks or
[1:20:14] that same tape that you listen to and
[1:20:16] you swear somebody put that in there
[1:20:20] but I like what he said and I believe
[1:20:21] the same thing it wasn't your time
[1:20:24] so that was withheld from you you didn't
[1:20:26] need that to and don't get me wrong you
[1:20:29] didn't need that to convolute all that
[1:20:30] because you would bring in a subject
[1:20:32] to you you were bringing a subject all
[1:20:35] right thereby with me
[1:20:37] but then when you're right when you need
[1:20:38] that God just pulls his hand back
[1:20:40] because he says right here he said I
[1:20:42] will bring all things to your
[1:20:44] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:20:47] you
[1:20:48] acts 1 verse 4 is being assembled
[1:20:51] together with him commanding them that
[1:20:52] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[1:20:53] this is Jesus but wait for the promise
[1:20:55] of the Father which he said you have
[1:20:58] heard of me for John truly baptized with
[1:21:00] water but you shall be baptized with the
[1:21:02] Holy Ghost not many days hence in other
[1:21:05] words 11 days later on the day of
[1:21:07] Pentecost when they therefore will come
[1:21:09] together they asked said Lord without
[1:21:11] this time restore again the Kingdom of
[1:21:12] Israel they didn't understand what he
[1:21:13] was talking about
[1:21:14] and he said unto them it's not for you
[1:21:16] to know the time of the seasons which
[1:21:18] the father is putting his own power but
[1:21:19] you shall receive power after
[1:21:23] not realize you always won not realize
[1:21:26] you just see this seed woke up inside of
[1:21:28] you that's not what he said he you shall
[1:21:31] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:33] is what
[1:21:35] come upon you
[1:21:37] it wasn't there
[1:21:40] it come upon you
[1:21:42] and you shall be Witnesses in Jerusalem
[1:21:44] Judea Samaria uttermost parts of the
[1:21:46] earth that's us thank God Acts 2 verse 4
[1:21:48] it says they were all what filled
[1:21:51] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:21:53] speak with other tones that the spirit
[1:21:54] gave him utterance Acts 19 1 and when he
[1:21:57] came to pass it while Apollos was a
[1:21:59] Corinth Paul having passed through the
[1:22:01] upper Coast came to Ephesus finding
[1:22:02] certain disciples he said have you
[1:22:04] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:22:05] believe in other words he was watching
[1:22:07] their their he was sitting in their
[1:22:09] congregation
[1:22:10] and he knew there was one thing lacking
[1:22:15] being a prophet
[1:22:17] he knew they needed the Holy Ghost
[1:22:20] he knew they were doing a good job under
[1:22:22] sanctification they were teaching and
[1:22:23] they were doing but he knew they were
[1:22:25] not going to go any further until the
[1:22:28] Holy Ghost came on those people
[1:22:31] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:22:33] you believed
[1:22:35] that's my question tonight if you
[1:22:37] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:22:38] believe this message
[1:22:41] and they said unto him we don't know
[1:22:43] what you're talking about
[1:22:45] we have not read that book yet
[1:22:48] we have not listened to that tape yet
[1:22:51] we have not so much as heard whether
[1:22:53] there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto
[1:22:56] them how are you baptized they said John
[1:22:57] John was good listen John was a prophet
[1:23:00] but remember John came to introduce the
[1:23:04] Messiah
[1:23:05] not to give people the Holy Ghost
[1:23:09] Paul came
[1:23:12] in an open door to bring the Gentiles
[1:23:14] and get the Holy Ghost to them right
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:18] then Paul said John barely baptized with
[1:23:20] the baptism of repentance saying unto
[1:23:22] the people that you should believe on
[1:23:24] him which should come after him that is
[1:23:26] on Christ Jesus and when they heard this
[1:23:29] in other words when they heard this
[1:23:30] they're like whoa we have never heard
[1:23:32] this before
[1:23:35] but we perceive and believe that
[1:23:37] something else needs to happen in my
[1:23:39] life
[1:23:40] even a Polish
[1:23:42] can get a preacher now to agree he
[1:23:44] didn't have the new birth
[1:23:45] it'd be a fight and when Paul had laid
[1:23:48] hands on him the Holy Ghost came on them
[1:23:51] and they Spate with tongues and
[1:23:52] prophesied if you continue on down
[1:23:54] through there they all got the Holy
[1:23:56] Ghost and it was a real strong powerful
[1:23:57] church it was 12 of them
[1:23:59] all right
[1:24:01] Romans 5 verse 5 says
[1:24:03] hope maketh not a shame because the love
[1:24:06] of God is shed abroad what in our hearts
[1:24:08] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:24:13] Ephesians 4 verse 29 said let no corrupt
[1:24:16] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:24:17] but that which is good to use of
[1:24:20] edifying that it may Minister Grace unto
[1:24:23] the hearers and grieve not the holy
[1:24:26] spirit of God whereby you are sealed
[1:24:28] unto the day of your Redemption all
[1:24:32] right grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:24:34] whereby you are sealed and when you're
[1:24:37] sealed that demon can't get back in
[1:24:40] because you got all of God in your soul
[1:24:44] that's exactly what happens that's why
[1:24:46] the new birth is ill taught
[1:24:49] because there's still roots of
[1:24:51] bitterness there's still wrath but look
[1:24:52] he says let all bitterness and wrath and
[1:24:54] anger clamor evil speaking look be put
[1:24:56] away from you
[1:24:59] with all malice
[1:25:01] and be ye kind one to another
[1:25:03] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:25:06] as God for Christ's sake forgive you
[1:25:11] let me read this in church order
[1:25:14] 1958 brother Ryan says we believe in
[1:25:16] justification by faith Romans 5 1.
[1:25:19] we believe that after a person being
[1:25:22] justified by faith he has peace with the
[1:25:24] Lord Jesus Christ but look but it's
[1:25:26] possible that that same person could
[1:25:29] have habits such as drinking smoking
[1:25:31] doing things he shouldn't do filthy
[1:25:32] habits of the flesh all right so he's
[1:25:34] teaching us correct that's justification
[1:25:36] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:25:38] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:25:41] service of the Lord because remember God
[1:25:44] won't dwell on unclean vessel he won't
[1:25:45] use an unclean person all right so you
[1:25:47] got to get that unclean Spirit out we
[1:25:49] believe in sanctification according to
[1:25:51] Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus also
[1:25:54] that he might sanctify the people with
[1:25:55] his own blood suffered without the gate
[1:25:58] and we believe that sanctification is
[1:26:01] taught in the New Testament now remember
[1:26:03] sanctification couldn't be taught
[1:26:05] in the Old Testament
[1:26:08] there was nothing to sanctify the
[1:26:09] believer
[1:26:11] all right
[1:26:13] and meant for the Believers through the
[1:26:16] New Testament age
[1:26:18] which we're living are now living and we
[1:26:21] also believe that after that person has
[1:26:23] been Sanctified unclean habits has gone
[1:26:27] from the person
[1:26:30] he is a Believer now look sanctification
[1:26:33] he is a Believer on the Lord Jesus
[1:26:35] Christ and his habits are gone
[1:26:38] we believe that then he is a candidate
[1:26:43] so listen these are definite steps
[1:26:46] that's why I read this quote these are
[1:26:48] definite steps that brother Brown breaks
[1:26:49] them all apart
[1:26:51] and he says now you're a candidate not
[1:26:54] that you're gonna he said he didn't say
[1:26:56] no you're automatically now going to be
[1:26:57] born again
[1:27:00] he said you're a candidate for the
[1:27:02] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:04] which comes as a filling of the believer
[1:27:07] and then when the Believers just as many
[1:27:10] times he's taught like we taught it here
[1:27:11] one time before you pick up a glass well
[1:27:14] when when you pick up a glass I don't
[1:27:15] care how dirty it is if you need a drink
[1:27:17] of water you picked it up for a purpose
[1:27:20] so God in justification he picked you up
[1:27:22] for a purpose
[1:27:23] but she was dirty filthy had all kind of
[1:27:26] mud and everything inside of you but by
[1:27:28] the washing of the water the word or
[1:27:29] putting it in a real good environment of
[1:27:32] soap and water
[1:27:35] it got cleaned up then you took that
[1:27:37] same glass
[1:27:39] and you poured water in it
[1:27:41] because remember Sanctified is set aside
[1:27:43] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:27:46] in service is the filling and you drink
[1:27:48] it
[1:27:49] all right very simple
[1:27:51] so justification is picking it up to use
[1:27:55] it with a purpose in heart
[1:27:56] that's what God does to The Sinner he's
[1:27:59] still filthy
[1:28:00] if I understand that he's still filthy
[1:28:04] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:28:06] Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a
[1:28:10] compound word which means cleaned and
[1:28:12] set aside for service not in service for
[1:28:16] service
[1:28:17] in the Old Testament the altar
[1:28:19] Sanctified The Vessel and it was set
[1:28:22] aside for service he's talking about
[1:28:24] literal vessels he ain't talking about
[1:28:25] people
[1:28:27] all right now look we believe that the
[1:28:30] holy spirit is putting that same vessel
[1:28:33] in service
[1:28:36] that's why brother Brown said you
[1:28:38] shouldn't preach without having the Holy
[1:28:39] Ghost you shouldn't you shouldn't be a
[1:28:41] deacon you shouldn't have offices
[1:28:42] without having the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost
[1:28:44] because you are put in service for the
[1:28:47] Lord now if you have the baptism of the
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost all right let's read this
[1:28:52] quote real quick I think this is
[1:28:54] yeah
[1:28:56] let's read this real quick and then
[1:28:58] we'll close
[1:29:00] it works of Faith Express 1965.
[1:29:03] now remember this is after the seals
[1:29:05] broke so a lot of people on the message
[1:29:06] think that brother Brown have changed
[1:29:08] his way of the war of of getting born
[1:29:10] again after the seals broke all right
[1:29:12] well let's read 1965. now remember
[1:29:14] you're in a cycle of three
[1:29:18] but you're one person
[1:29:20] like Father Son and Holy Ghost cycle of
[1:29:22] three but one person
[1:29:25] y'all excuse me but these new teeth I
[1:29:27] keep biting my keep biting my cheek I've
[1:29:30] lost so much weight
[1:29:33] I don't feel good
[1:29:34] chewing on my chewing on my mouth but
[1:29:37] one person look three attributes of the
[1:29:39] same God fatherhood three offices like
[1:29:42] fatherhood sonship Holy Ghost and you
[1:29:44] are Body Spirit Soul we know that
[1:29:46] but now watch he said now the outside
[1:29:48] body has five inlets to it to contact
[1:29:51] your Earthly home she tastes feel
[1:29:53] smelling here that has nothing to do
[1:29:55] with your spirituality
[1:29:57] zero
[1:30:01] zero
[1:30:03] well I can see so I must be up
[1:30:05] no you see because you're a human
[1:30:08] and but listen your sight
[1:30:12] and all these things can be
[1:30:13] misinterpreted
[1:30:15] remember I told you Jim's got a to make
[1:30:17] our our soap that smells like dirt
[1:30:20] brother George ain't no dirt in it at
[1:30:22] all
[1:30:23] it's a chemical in a bottle that we drop
[1:30:25] into the soap that smells just exactly
[1:30:28] like dirt but it is not dirt so yours it
[1:30:32] just Foods all your sea taste feels
[1:30:33] smelling here all right the inside which
[1:30:35] is a spirit has five senses conscious
[1:30:38] love and so forth let me go through a
[1:30:40] memory reason conscious affection and
[1:30:42] Imagination but the inside of that the
[1:30:45] soul has one thing
[1:30:47] and that's where you live
[1:30:50] the spirit can come out here and anoint
[1:30:53] you to do certain things watch this and
[1:30:56] you do it but that don't mean you're
[1:30:58] saved
[1:31:01] think of it Caiaphas prophesied
[1:31:04] Judas cast out devils
[1:31:07] see the spirit anointed him
[1:31:10] this rain falls on the just and the
[1:31:13] unjust the weeds can Rejoice with the
[1:31:16] wheat
[1:31:18] but it's what it is at the core
[1:31:21] there's where you can
[1:31:23] intellectuals can accept and say oh sure
[1:31:26] that looks good I believe that I still
[1:31:28] don't do it no sir
[1:31:30] the spirit can actually make witness of
[1:31:32] it
[1:31:34] so
[1:31:35] because if that Soul hasn't come from
[1:31:38] God
[1:31:39] it can make all the impersonations out
[1:31:42] of here
[1:31:43] but it cannot be real
[1:31:46] you can act healing watch this
[1:31:49] you can act like you have
[1:31:52] you can act like you receive it now
[1:31:54] watch this Christians can act like
[1:31:57] they're Christians
[1:32:00] hmm
[1:32:02] let me read that again Christians can
[1:32:05] act like they're Christians I'm reading
[1:32:07] quote
[1:32:08] and I and I can be ever so good at it
[1:32:11] but that don't mean they're saved
[1:32:14] that's exactly right see the spirit can
[1:32:17] be there look the real genuine spirit
[1:32:22] we're not even getting into annoying
[1:32:24] ones because we don't have time but it
[1:32:25] is next the Holy Spirit can anoint you
[1:32:28] that still don't mean you're saved
[1:32:32] it's that inside Soul That Never Dies
[1:32:35] it's God eternal life
[1:32:37] it always now look it always was eternal
[1:32:40] life what eternal life was already
[1:32:42] eternal life not your soul it came from
[1:32:44] God it goes to God it's the salt what
[1:32:46] the soul you have now
[1:32:49] now that you got another Soul it's the
[1:32:51] soul that's regenerated now
[1:32:55] listen your soul came from God it
[1:32:57] doesn't matter if you're a sinner or a
[1:32:58] saint
[1:32:59] so you had to have not an exchange of
[1:33:01] your soul or you'd be another person
[1:33:04] but God come in and clean the nature of
[1:33:06] that all of your soul out and put his
[1:33:08] nature in really simple which is the
[1:33:10] what is the nature of God eternal life
[1:33:16] so we'll stop right there let's stand
[1:33:18] our feet come on musicians
[1:33:20] I like I love that quote Christians can
[1:33:23] act like they're Christian
[1:33:25] and act like they're ever so good at it
[1:33:30] we get to this point in the anointings
[1:33:31] where many will say to me in that day
[1:33:33] Lord Lord have we not prophesied enough
[1:33:34] now look prophesy
[1:33:37] Caiaphas prophesied the truth
[1:33:41] and thy name cast out Devils Judas can
[1:33:44] say that
[1:33:45] and thy name done many wonderful works
[1:33:49] and then will I profess unto them I
[1:33:52] never knew now that word new is not like
[1:33:54] me knowing sister Anna it's like me
[1:33:56] knowing sister you
[1:33:58] like Adam knew his wife Eve if you'll
[1:34:00] look that word up you'll see that it's a
[1:34:02] relationship different than just shaking
[1:34:04] hands and knowing somebody so depart
[1:34:06] from me in other words I never had an
[1:34:08] intimate relationship with you
[1:34:12] depart from me you that work iniquity
[1:34:19] then he talks about the anointing we'll
[1:34:20] talk about that next time but just pray
[1:34:22] for the services this coming weekend
