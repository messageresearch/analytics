these number one thank You' all so much for the pastor appreciation um thing downstairs uh when church is over there's plenty of donuts and cupcakes coffee milk and juice please make yourself at home and eat what you want uh but I thank you so very much thank you for the gifts and and the uh and the cards we sure appreciate each and every one of you uh it's been now close to 5 months I guess it is or 6 months and uh it hadn't really um struck home so much yet but uh but uh I miss my dad yeah I miss miss I miss him miss him a lot and uh um hooking everything up and getting ready to go hunting I'm going to be leaving this afternoon going to Illinois for a week to hunt and sister June and and um and her U well you ain't an Uber driver you're a rider and her and her Uber Rider um sister um the older lady sitting right there beside of her can't remember Sister Regina they're going to be leaving this afternoon to her dad to spend a few days he's rocking on almost 91 so he's he's uh still hanging in there so we just still need to pray for him abolutely also downstairs whatever's left of that hunting stuff y'all see on that on those tables please take it home with you okay I I'm going to leave it there so either throw it away or take it home because I don't uh I don't need it I'm cleaning out my closet and uh and getting everything ready to uh to go but like I said before while I was hooking all that stuff up yesterday you know Dad and I would always leave together I know most most of you know that we'd always leave together and we hunted together a lot and uh just to not ever have that again it just feels a little empty feels feels a little uh little uh actually a little out of place um but we're humans we have emotions but we know God's the one that takes all things in his hand he controlls it he knew it before the foundation of the world and he knew his timing was perfect to take brother Dale and and whether we understand or not the song says we'll understand it better by and by amen so uh we're here to to uh to share the load with you we're not here to to uh to be the Taskmaster master we're here to be servant we serve you and we sure appreciate all of you and appreciate your prayers love you with the love of the Lord all right brother Bob is going to is brother Larry Harris this coming or today and uh then this coming Wednesday brother Aaron Roberts will be speaking for us we sure appreciate brother Aaron n yeah that guy that spoke Wednesday night I almost had it but he did a real good job we sure appreciate them also remember uh if you want to look on Hickory Bible Tabernacle um you can see what they're doing uh we gave money to them and also to brother Donnie's church I believe we need to take care of our own before we take care of others and um we don't know of any believers that are struggling but we know that some of them lost everything they had and there's no insurance for some of that so so you think about what situation you'd be in if that happened to you so we just keep them in prayer and we're also going to continue to send funds to them as we can to help them in their relief effort all right so now also um next Sunday we'll have regular morning service next Sunday all right everybody with me but brother Bob will be speaking because I'll be getting back late Saturday night brother Bob will be speaking but now at 2:00 that same day on Sunday we're going to have a Bible study all right it's free to anybody wants to come we're going to have it up here and we will not have any song service we'll just I've got three questions just left over from when we quit doing Bible study several months ago I got three questions left over and I think I need to answer them and if you have any questions bring them with you or text them to me between now and Sunday so it's it's not mandatory it's just like we always have a Bible study as we did before on Saturdays I told you we were going to try to do this some so at

the the first Sunday we're going to start doing a uh someone asked the other day about picking a subject and just stay on that one subject like the third pull you know what brother Brandon mean by this it's kind of like the questions and answers but instead of trying to throw enough for everybody out then if you don't know what the third pull is we're going to we're going to take and and we're going to talk about the three pulls all right so we'll do that starting in November to give us a little more time since we're only doing one service and I told Brother Lis I said I'm going to take my time today y'all may not y'all may take all them cookies up downstairs but that's okay we going to take a little our time today because I try I run away from Brother um Louis every once in a while and

getting back that that uh Wednesday so just keep everything in prayer again thank you for the um gifts and cards um we just want to serve God serve God the best way we can amen and if you come to church today to hear me you need to go back home rethink this thing and pray and and come here hear from God let God speak to us so we're going to continue on this transition to Perfection let's bow our heads dear Lord Lord this group of people is assembled today and Lord I pray that you become the preeminent one Lord to speak the word to him Lord you said you'd sent us the Holy Ghost to teach us the truth and father I pray today as as we speak Lord it it be you speaking Lord and that you'd help brother Louise Lord as he speaks too father Lord bless the ones that are sick the ones that are traveling ones not with us today father I pray that you'd be with us as a church family Lord bind us together be with the different ones Lord that that are traveling mom and sister C and sister gwy and sister Chi Lord I pray that you'd give them something they're going to Jeffersonville so Lord give them something Lord that they can see father that we had a prophet walk the earth in this end time father and we appreciate that thank you for sending him to me Lord I want all of us to know that you sent that man to me you sent that message to me Lord I appreciate that and we can identified in the word of God but now as we open back these Pages Lord you anoint us father for this journey in Jesus name amen so we're still on we're in the layout of sin Church age now listen like I said before you are in that church age we're not speaking of Luther we're not speaking of Wesley that was history they're actually in history books right but remember this is the mystery that's to be revealed in the end time I still I'm working on 20-some scriptures if you've got some I'd like to see them anything pertaining to the end time there are many scriptures that says Daniel I'm going to read it to you in a minute Daniel shut up shut it up till the time of the end right so let's read someone said if you change the way you look at things me the things you look at change that's profound if you change the way you look at things everybody wants you to look the way they look no that's not the way God is uh we can't tell God a better way to do anything no don't even try uh he's not even listening okay but you know what'll happen the devil will move in he said yeah you can change that hello that's what he did through man he changed the Bible all right if you change the way you look at things the things you look at change but what do we we're human beings and what's the first thing we hate we hate change but change me Lord change me oh God as the scripture as the song says so let's read Revelations 3:14 now this is to me and you so this scripture is to us yes to the angel of the Church of the layout of sins right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true true witness the beginning of the creation of God that's real funny that he said the beginning cuz it looks like this is the end that's the last Church age that's the end of it but we'll get to it in just a little bit I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot I would thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor heart I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing that number 22 there in red there's 22 million millionaires in the United States 22 million millionaires in the United States one out of every eight like I said before I'm we're all in that seven we ain't that one maybe some of you are I don't know but 20 so there we have increase with Goods have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked in other words you think you got it but you got nothing yeah right as brother John is saying you know it's good to be good with your finances it's good to do all that but you got to put the word of God first when you do put the word of God first then he'll teach you how to do these other things amen I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich see not rich like The 22 million rich like The richness of God in the word of God and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I say that thou mayest see as many as I love now look as many as I love I rebuke and chasen that's what he's been doing be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come to him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me now watch in my Throne not on in my throne even as I also overcame and him sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word as we get started here we're going we're transitioning from partial to perfect or from okay transitioning from one thing to another to transition as we're going to look at before that means you have to make a move there's something changing and we're going to read here in a little bit brother Brown said that's what happened to the Pentecostal people people they wouldn't change they cabbage down on this the gifts is the speaking in tongues is the gifts and this is the latter rain movement and this is it and this is it well what did Brother rown do he said oh no he said you don't even have the former Reign yet we're God's moving on God's ever moving whether you want to move or not God's ever moving and listen I'll promise you we read the back of the book there's a group of people that will move with him yes sir you got to decide whether you will or not first Corinthians says charity never faileth see we want something that doesn't fail we've all listen this government is failing us all of the economy is going to fail us everything in this world's going to even our bodies are failing us amen well some of you young people didn't say Amen but us older ones said amen our B everything's failing us but the love of God will never fail you and you got to have that love of God in your soul that's the new birth that's not just loving God with your voice or your head amen it's from your heart all right where there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall Bish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come there's one of your end time scriptures when that which is perfect is come now God's always been perfect he's looking for a perfect people that will say that they're perfect all right then that which is in part shall be done away not done away like you're gone no we build on that Foundation we build man built a car on an A-frame one time they call it an a model then they built it on a a t- model because it was built on a t frame but we don't live in them days anymore we drive electric cars and cars that don't even have a frame but that's man progressing as man progresses then you ought to look at God and see how he progresses first right that's for each one of us Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child there's not a problem being a child there's not a problem starting as a baby but let's don't be 30 years down the road in our Christian journey and still be a baby and you the only one that knows it and now people around you will too when I was a child I spake as a child doesn't everybody know when there's a kid in the house right doesn't everybody know when there's a kid in the in the uh uh in the room and what's the first thing you do wake up David he was awake but you know there's a kid there when there's a kid in the room you know he's there all right they're usually not very silent unless they're asleep and then you've had to put them to sleep because they were crying but let's not be that let's be mature adults when I was a child I spake as a child now look I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things as brother Steven Wilson was saying you know 1 plus one is two that's pretty slow and pretty Elementary but you got to have that to get to the rest of it for now we see through a glass Darkly now this is Paul but then to face to face I want you to get something today you're a special group of people God's brought you to this message give you something to look at he's give you tapes books now MP3s now computers now whatever you can you can stick it in your ear and listen to the prophet where you used to have to have a 7in reel the thing is this big trust me we have them in the floor at the house all the time cuz that's about the only place it fit it was so big it was one tape at a time and if that tape got stretched out the voice got stretched out but now you've got it in crystal clear press play anytime you want to but they didn't they didn't even have a Bible before Luther remember before Luther there was no Bible Columba didn't have one all the other ones didn't have one but we have everything we need that's why we in America are going to get it as brother Bram said we're going to get it worse than anybody because we had a Prophet come that we didn't need an interpreter we heard in our own language he came here to give us a message and I'll promise you when you look at that scripture that says behold I stand at the door and knock now I know that's Jesus Christ but brother brandham was Jesus Christ of this age oh come on it's the only Jesus they'll ever see and what was he doing after he got to preach the word he had to knock at the door to get into those denominations and they shut the door and wouldn't let him in because he was preaching Jesus Christ he started preaching the son of man Ministry now I want you to get something before you pass out brother brandom's message is in two parts if you've been here long enough you've known brother D's preached this for Years brother Brown's message is in two parts right and I'll read it here in a little while he come to do what restore us back bring that Foundation as zerubabel took and swept off the foundation and started building holding it right the gifts coming back he brought back the uh loose ends as he said which is the false doctrine that was down through the church ages that God winked at but that wasn't his message that was a preparation for a message to come and as I said before he was still preaching up until 1962 or so that spoken words Original Seed he had been speaking in the son of man Revelation or the Cornerstone are the man anointing everybody with me the eagle anointing only came when that book came open right all right when that book came open the seals were were preached and revealed under his ministry and all these other great things that happened under his ministry third pole speaking of the word squirrels and all that when all that happened and culminated in a message we'll read it here in just a little bit that was the real reason he was sent there was your Malachi 4 anointing in so he's two parts 47 to 63 he was trying to get them out of that Pentecostal age into a bride age or a new age the beginning of the creation of God he was trying to get them out of that come out of her my people but they just stayed there then I'll read you quote here in just a few minutes brother R said some of these people will take this message and break it down right and that's us that's all the messages we've been hearing God has broke this thing down and what we're doing now is we've got to what setting in the presence of the Sun and ring the s o n not the Su n cuz we've come to full grain folks whether you believe it or not we've come to The Headstone the headship of the word of God this transition to Perfection involves you it involves you it doesn't involve the fre listen it doesn't involve William brandom on it's the days of the voice of that seventh angel when he begins to Proclaim his message the only way he proclaimed his message is through a group of people absolutely that's true you can read all you want to you got all the like I said before everything when I go down the road today I can turn on a sermon anywhere around the world going down the road I can listen to Archive sermons I whatever going down the road Road you couldn't do that with a 7 in reel you might do it with one but you couldn't take eight or 10 with you you'd have to throw your hunting stuff out which we would but we know now it's on just a little bitty thing it's actually in your phone which is cooked up to your car now so listen we don't have any excuse we have none God has took every excuse out of our way absolutely he's give us the word of God he's give us able ministers and and just to put a rose uh dad's gone on but I'll give him another one we didn't have to worry through and Wade through false Doctrine a lot of other people churches they had to weigh through false Doctrine there's several come up with this kind of Doctrine and then that where you come that you polygamy was okay and then the the Thunders was we were already in the Millennium and the Thunders were seven different people and we never had to deal with that but listen more is given more is required and I'm saying that loud more is required so we can't sit there and say we don't know we've been listening for 50 years what's it been doing for us that's right that's right I'm talking right here back that way that's true now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known I don't know that Paul thought he was was the first church age messenger but he'll know he knows it now and now abide faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is a gape love or the word of God to you and me you can you can put it in everything you want to Brother John you can say it's this it's a feeling it's an emotion it is the word of God sent to you that is the love of God for God so loved the world that he sent the word his only begotten son that was the word he sent his word to tell us the mind of God then he sent us a prophet in the end time to reveal all the things have been shut out of the mind of God come on somebody that man's ideas has shut it up and now we have the open book amen so now as we look at the church ages we are in the very last one over here called Leia we come through that Holy Ghost age you can see there on top we wrote that in then we we had Elijah come at the end of that Holy Ghost age no Messenger to bring us a message to call to lay out of sins out of that Pentecostal era into the full word of God or you see that word says eternity that's what he preached us into nobody else could do that right no great man could do that only a prophet could take the Eternal Mind Of God bring it to a group of people and we understand it all right like I said what a great privileged people we are that we can say as had Wright said that ain't nothing but the truth can you say that can you say that ain't this this is nothing but the truth there's no error in this message at all amen none whatsoever so you ought to be satisfied today that you're setting in the way place you're supposed to be to get out of here amen we've transitioned from church age to bride age to get us out of here age the future home brother Brown says look so this is the holy ghost in the upper room I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption to you before if I don't get nothing else that's why I love the future home he takes you through every part of your Christian journey in that book or that message called the future home that's what he does I mean he's talking about the city that we're going to he's talking about the Earth that we're going to be on which is this one but he explains it to a t but he comes right here and he says oh I'm just trying to get to you the Plan of Redemption CU what happened in Noah's age Noah God wiped the world off with water justification Jesus Christ came and died and shed his blood at Calvary sanctification you can only be Sanctified through the blood all right then it's going to be a Holy Ghost Fire baptism coming up here not this one coming up World War III no uhuh not the one that's coming no they're going to be nuclear war and these people are going to be burnt buildings will still be here he's talking about the Holy Ghost Fire as he says about you that burns up everything God's fire is going to turn this back to a Garden of Eden yes amen I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption to you before if I don't get nothing else see the baptism of fire on it only is to cleanse it and make it a fit place for his Meek to live in like he did us his creation to live in before he could come in it now see there's your I don't want us to have any reservation that you came here with eternal life inside of your soul amen no way I don't care you can bring me 100 quotes I'm going to tell you something the things I did God wasn't nowhere around well pray for me I'm the only one all right just pray for me y'all bunch of perfected people I just really appreciate y'all that didn't drink smoke cuss run around and oh somebody come on now get where we live and you know what you knew you did it cuz you were there and God was nowhere around yeah oh yeah he was there in his predestinated plant he was there in his when he the the woman at the well he said she had representation the representation is as brother B was talking about the other Sunday is that God knew he'd cross your path and you'd accept it and it was your choice so you can say it was my choice but no in God's eyes no we didn't have a choice I said in God's mind he can't change he can't even have a choice he made one that you were that Genesis 126 man you know what that's my first scripture for this end time message that's my first scripture because you and I are going to be that completeness on Earth just like God wanted it in the Garden of Eden before we leave this place when our bodies are changed back come on somebody when our bodies are changed back to young men and women that is that Genesis 126 man in Flesh on the Earth all hell's going to break loose and we're going praise godl we going to walk out of the Tomb and they going to say all power in heaven and earth been given unto me amen just like Jesus did oh that's too rich that ain't Rich enough spill some water it's okay Mom Mom's not here but I did sorry now watch he had to give us he before he could come in it who's it you before he could come in it he had to give us the baptism of fire that's why the tongues of fire were on those people and remember that tongue of fire didn't leave it sunk right down in them remember that word uded with power from on high ued means embedded or put in the Holy listen the Holy Ghost can anoint you and then leave the Holy Ghost could anoint Kus and leave the holy listen to me the Holy Ghost could anoint Judas because he did anoint Judas Judas Judas preached the message just as good as the other 11 because the other 11 were deceived he was such a good preacher so he deceived those other 11 then the Holy Ghost come in and live baptism of fire then when you get that baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost can come in yes remember sanctification cleans you sets you aside for service but doesn't put you in service because because you're still open you're open to the devil to come back but once you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and burns all that out yes your Soul's just as Eternal as God is when he comes back in dwelling inside of you absolutely I said you're just as Eternal as God is abely then the Holy Ghost can come in what as it does it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you now we got a long way to go because remember in your soul you're Eternal in your soul you're complete in your soul you're you're sitting in Heavenly places but we got a spirit realm that's still caught in this Dimension yes sir we got a spirit realm that still got that adamic nature attached to it that makes us think wrong do wrong act wrong do the things wrong that we brother Brown says we sin every day I was looking at a at a piece of literature and they were talking about lying people lie and ow they come up with this if if it's wrong they're lying anyhow um they said the average human being listen to this the average human being lies four times a day average human being now we met some that way above that average I Ain't Met many as below it but we met a bunch that was above it guy we used to hunt with he'd tell a lie and he'd believe it self remember it right T yeah oh I ain't going to call his name but yeah he just he' tell you a lie before he could tell you the truth and then he sit there and make you believe it because he kept telling it over and over again ain't that what Satan does he keeps telling you the same lie and listen God says in the scripture that he'll let Satan do that and you believe it scripture says and be damned by it cuz you going to just keep oh I believe that if it's contrary to the word of God it's not of God period that's why we sin you know why we sin every day we have bad thoughts we don't have to physically sin like we sinned before BC before Christ everybody with me you're living in sin because you have to eat you're living in sin because you get tired you're living in sin because a lot of y'all are gray-headed that weren't or no hair or worse but that see that's why this body is the sin part when brother BR said you sin every day that doesn't mean we go out and drink and smoke no no we just have bad thoughts we are contrary to God being in this Dimension we're contrary to God so just accept that and say okay God you knew this was going to happen you knew before the foundation of the world this is what was going to happen now for you to get a hold of me you're going to have to do it yes you're going to have to keep me from sinning cuz I can't now listen if we do have a problem with all the smoking and drinking and cussing and all that stuff you're not born again let's let's ratchet back over this way a little bit all right when brother BR said you sin every day he's talking about Christians he said Christians sin every day but look but it's got to be the entire word we're looking today at the entire word of God open so that you can understand it but it's got to be the entire word to be the bride you have to be a part of him he is the word and what a part of him is it the word that's promised for this day yes Luther was promised justification in another day his justification will just barely get you in church come on if y'all going to sleep then um you going to have a long day the word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride I was I was I sinned yesterday I watched Tennessee football game but it was 105,000 josi don't smile there was aund hey Livia there was 105,000 people in one place watching 22 people kick a ball around and beat each other up yeah they never sat down the whole game cuz Tennessee won in overtime 105,000 they weren't doing this no 105,000 this section wore all white this section wore all orange this section wore all white they got prepared come on cuz they had to be coordinated you could put 105,000 in there and and 10,000 be white white shirts and 10,000 be orange and white and orange that had to be coordinated why can't we do that in the gospel and I'm talking about me too why can't we be so happy that God's give us a a stadium to sit in and I promise you those 22 people's on the field today they're sore and a couple of them got knocked out of the game and they probably have injuries is going to haunt them for the rest of their life enough of that what is there to get excited about I mean that's temporal anyway all that's temporal stuff that's why I said all this is a lie it's all temporal It's All Temporary everything you see in your daily walk is temporary has an end to it the only thing doesn't have an end is that word of God that you take in your soul and you apply it to your life amen remember Don't Preach me a sermon live me one don't tell me what the word says live what the word says I can set up here and tell you what the word says and you just it don't do any good but live it those people on the day of Pentecost they were happy they received something nobody ever received before in their soul they received the new birth right in their soul happy run outside Paul says this Peter says this is that this is what was we were ready for this don't you remember Jesus told us all these things it got quickened the word got quickened in their heart so now let's jump up to isusa Street Pentecost now when we get to isusa Street Pentecost what has happened through six Church ages man has got involved and just totally deluded the word of God Mary was the mother of God baptism was different everything was different than the first church Age first two or three Church ages everybody with me there's denominations have been set up all these different camps and different ideas I like what brother Brandon was saying in here you know we used to read about Constantine how he was this great guy he was this you know Crusader and he had the crosses on his back and crosses on his shield what' brother Bram say he wasn't even converted he just had a dream that Satan could have give him come on somebody I believe if God give it to him he sure misinterpreted it wrong but Satan gave it to him and he started and put church and state together and that's what messed this whole thing up so he's not that very great of a man so now we've come to Pentecost zza Street we're coming up closer we're under the man anointing which man is smart shrewd yes very shrewd very smart Right Way smarter than the lion way smarter than the ox man has done all this in his smartness smartphones smart cars a lot of smart Alexs if you don't know what that is look at that but we're under the mount anointing until the full word of God opens to us all right we're under partial Revelation until the full word of God opens up all right so now watch brother Donald he okay he do okay all right Christine you you don't have her on okay she got it on usually Christine will go slow down slow down you see each one of these ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit now we have had people in the message say that well they were false so they didn't have listen if you got one molecule of the Holy Ghost in your soul you're just as Eternal as God is I said in your soul if he's in your soul today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the new birth you're just as Eternal as God is he took fishermen that couldn't they signed their name by X come that's right unlearned give them the Holy Ghost but it was a dip justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down now we're talking about brother brandham no Messenger to the age of the Pentecostal all right cuz there wasn't one at first the Alpha and Omega there wasn't one at the first there was a spokesman named Peter but they waited on Paul to get there to interpret the word of God from the mind of God everybody with me same thing over here if the alpha bride and omega's got to be bookends so there was a Pentecostal age that had no messenger the one ey black men Seymour param and all them they they they they tried they tried they did what God told them to do that's right they got the gifts restored and they started getting people in church and they started getting people filled with the Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost cuz right here brother Brown said look the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism not partial in the fullness but what happened is they stayed there they didn't move on but you and I have moved on yes sir amen but at the end of the age as it always ends up the others what at the end of the Pentecostal age at the end of 1906 is zza Street which last till 1915 which continued on to about 1922 if you'll read your history and we went through that but at the end of that age as it always ends upon the others we find then a messenger sent a person identified in the word of God Malachi 4 was sent to those people but they put him out the door I got a book I'm going to read when I'm hunting it was it's like a list of Great Men John G Lake D Moody brother Brown's not even in that book Luther Wesley Billy Graham it's got it just names a whole bunch of people that were influential from from Luther all the way up to here sanki Benny Calvin all those different ones brother Brown's not in it at all you know why he's in God's General but remember what he they said in God's generals pretty much the healing campaign was all they were worried about when he started preaching they did away with him well guess what it wasn't this over here they were supposed to get right yeah it was this over here we'll read that in just a minute everybody all right but at the end of the age as it always ends up on the other messenger comes in the age we find there then the messenger sent and all these Scruples and things that are to be placed in their places see what zerubabel is doing see what Elijah did remember when the prophets of Baal what did they do they jumped up on they went to Mount Carmel jumped up the Altar and just tore it all to pieces and then Elijah before God came with the fire and got all the water and the sacrifice Elijah had to put them Stones back he was restoring worship he was restoring order in the church cuz they had got so out of order do as a Baptist do well yeah do as a Baptist do no no no we're Methodist let's do over here we're going to sprinkle God's not that confused right he has a word amen that we to follow things will be placed in their places that's why I said if you get nothing else today you are in the Perfection that God's been looking for I'm not saying this building I'm saying the ministry the only way you're going to get perfected is by what Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists teaching and preaching the pure word of God that's the only way you're going to get perfected it's good to study come on now it's good to study makes my job a lot easier it's good to read and good to to to study and all that but you're not going to get it by yourself come on that's right I'll read it to you in a little bit now watch put in their place then the Rapture comes for the church so we went through the restoration the gifts we're not going to go through we'll go through all of them but not tell you what they are but we have this in our church we have gift of wisdom we have gift of knowledge Faith healing Miracles we've seen miracles in this congregation prophecy Amen brother colie in three days you go get your gun back that was a prophecy brother Dell said that from his Pulpit he got his gun stolen right right had his gun stolen and he told Brother Kylie he said you'll have that gun back in three days brother klie goes back home and another day or two after that the boy that stole it was sitting on the porch with the gun in his lap right and brought it back God had convicted him but it was a prophecy that come forth from here thank God so here's the one if if we we fail on speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues but if you don't get what I'm saying today it's in an unknown tongue true it'll take the Holy Ghost to interpret it for you so why were we given these gifts why were we given why did the Pentecostals ad30 because what did they do in the Old Testament as long as you made a sacrifice with a lamb or a bull or or or Ox I'm sorry an ox not a bull but an ox or a turtle dove you were fine amen but there had to be a transition from that Old Testament way to the New Testament yes all right so here Paul is explaining taking the Old Testament and bringing the New Testament alive from the Old Testament so here's brother random comes on the in the end time he's a prophet he here's only from God he takes all that that's been all muddled up and scrupled up and he takes it all and he puts it all together and says here this is the way we're supposed to do it right sisters are supposed to wear their dress is correct they're supposed to not cut their hair cuz remember the Pentecostal they got away from all that he said I come out here to California every year and he said your hair gets shorter amen but they were hearing the word of God now then there's other gifts that comes to the church after the pastor there's evangelist comes in and then there's teachers that's why I bring people in and I try to bring people in that'll help you and when they do help you I tell them you want every Minister that's preach for me that that I know of that I can remember I've told they always send me a text thank you for the offering thank you for letting me come you know what I tell them thank you for blessing my people amen if he didn't bless y'all he ain't coming back then there then there's evangelist we haven't had one like that so we're okay I try to vet them a little bit before they get here especially if I don't know them thank you Hey listen that's what I'm supposed to to do I'm supposed to watch after the Sheep not let the wolves in okay then there's teachers comes in and then there's prophets come in and then there's Apostles come in all these together working together with the gifts keeps the church perfected and clean and ready for the coming of the Lord so that's why God that's why they called gifts God gives a gift and listen he gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost but he's not an ending Giver he never takes it away cuz remember there's a difference in prop phy and a prophet all right there is a difference in a prophet in a five-fold Ministry and a word Prophet like brother brandom was you got to separate them right brother random was all that but we got prophets in the land they they said there's one a brother over in Africa and he comes here and preaches tried to get him here and he's booked up but they say he's a prophet that he can discern things that's not brother randam brother random is one gift identified in Malachi 4 and he was it right and it's not a spirit among the people it was one man and then the holy ghost anoints that man to speak the word to me and you so we can put our confidence in brother brandom no in God now he yielded himself right everybody with me so now the first seal we found the studying of the scripture that the messenger to the age comes right at the end of the age every time Paul come at the End of the Age Irene IUS come at the End of the Age Martin End of the Age Luther the end of the Catholic age now what was the Catholic age that was Columba all right the Dark Ages and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and the Pentecostals at the End of the Age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age now here he's saying where he stands without saying where he stands all right at the end of the Pentecostal Age We Are to receive according to the word what Malachi 4 as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see or receive not a message but a messenger with a message all right a messenger that will take all these Loose Ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church we believe he did that right Harvest Time 1964 and we didn't talk about this much when we talked about Pentecost but brother R covers it very well and if you if you're reading any of the message we know that Luther was the shoot two shoots Wesley was the stalk Pentecost was the shook the the as you take corn you can't eat it with a shuck on it you got to shuck it right so you got to pull the shuck away to get to the real grain same way with the grain of wheat you take wheat you got to do like this that's why they winnow it that's why they throw it up in the air the the Shu goes in one way seed goes down and they're separated all right everybody with me but what does a shook do if that corn just a regular corn that we grow if that corn Brother Gary just started growing with no shook wouldn't couldn't do it sun had burned it up PE worms would eat it but that shook is a carrier or a carrier of the life until the grain comes to full maturity now you and I are not shu we're full grain we just got a mature Pentecost protect listen to me Pentecost protected brother Bri's message so that it could get started right but it had to move on now look at that shuck what they do they spoke in tongues they act just exactly like they did at Pentecost and he talking about this Pentecost referring back to that Pentecost but if you'll cut that take that little thing pull it back in other words pull the Shook Back it's got many little Shooks in it and when you pull it back you see way back at the back of it you'll have to have a good glass looking back there there's a little teeny Bud of a grain coming on there is the real thing shu's not real how many of you eat a shook that's what I thought but that corn sure tastes good That Shook protects right that's right Pentecost was good at the time Pentecost was here right we can't get stuck in Pentecost there is the real thing what the shuck is a carrier why it has to be there to protect that grain look it's working in harmony but it's to protect that grain it's not grain it's to protect that grain now where the grain come from from the ground up through Luther cuz remember when the seed was planted it it looks just like that seed that's on the end of that plant everybody with me please don't get bored now where did the grain come from the ground up through Luther through them churches through Wesley and through there out through the tassel and now down into the shook now it looks just perfectly I mean a a big ear of corn looks real good when the shu's on it you got the tassel hanging off of it you know it's growing and you know when the tassel gets Brown and the shook starts pulling away a little bit you got a big old ear of corn but you don't run out there very first and start chucking it while it's still attached to the to the plant right you weit to it matures yes that's what it is with the word of God we've always had the mature word of God but man man has cut this thing down now it looks just perfectly no wonder Jesus said it would deceive the very elect if it were possible you know what he's telling he's telling the Pentecostals you're deceived that's why they hated him some of them ones that was a little bit spiritual they understood what he was saying and they kicked him out looks just like the grain right in the place the grain ought to be in other words the shu's not here and the seeds over here you don't have a Shu growing out of a corn stock and then the air corn over here it's inside it's all attached just looks just like the grain right in the place the grain ought to be but what happened it did the same thing that the others did before it it organized what did it become a carrier all right let's continue on so now we're going to look we're really we're talking about partial Revelation it's not verses but partial moving to perfect right now listen the words perfect always will be yes but we're the partial part you and I I know in part I prophesy in part but that which is perfect has come the part will be done away with Pentecost had a part but they weren't the seed so now as we transition the word transition means a change from one thing to the next either in action or state of being like the caterpillar when that caterpillar is born it has the butterfly inside of it but that caterpillar's got to eat the caterpillar is it shook cuz what happens you see those things on the side of a tree it's nothing but a shell like a Katie did in some of those I don't know what Katie did but ktie did it so maybe wake you up a little bit it is hot in here but you see that and there's nothing in it though what happened that life is gone and it's transitioned or transformed into a butterfly now what did the caterpillar have to do the caterpillar had to realize he was a caterpillar and start eating right and then what happened through transition or metamorphosis ever how you want to say it transition he transitioned into a butterfly the same life that was in a caterpillar but it didn't stay in that caterpillar it transformed itself into a butterfly same way with me and you by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost it trans it transitions us into God amen amen not like God so now we got to see in this transition period about halfway through if you want to know sit there for a little while You' be okay this is good I enjoyed I've enjoyed making this sermon but listen this ain't for me I know what I'm going to say it's for you so when we look at this trans why do we need a transition why do we need a transition we can't stay shuck Shuck's dead Shu dies after a while if you let that corn now now we take and shuck it when it's green cuz we like to eat it but now when I hun an Illinois they let that stock completely go to Brown it it look it it is dead and that corn is it the Shu starts pulling away itself but there is a IR corn this big and all the kernels are hard why they want that to plant that seed that's just like what went in the ground so they wanted all this had to die come on people all this had to die so that the grain could do what it's supposed to do they G to take that next year they gonna break it off of the cob they gonna go put it back in the ground and here the cycle goes again but you and I remember the Harvest is coming to take us out of here not replant us we're not coming to the replanting time this is Harvest and getting out of here time all right so there's a purpose for this transition then we have to have a vision knowing listen what would you be and I know you can't go backwards in time you can but but what would you be before there was this message what would you be before you even heard about even even if you were in a denomination and you just sat there sister Anna was in a Catholic church and and she knows it was just a formality the priest did everything for you don't get comfortable this and ain't but there was a but our Visions changed this world's deceived if if you're not born again today you're deceived the blinders are not off your eyes but when the blinders come off you see a vision you see actually the mind of God going to work is what you see the mind of God working in a group of people not in a building in a group of people that goes from here with a plan my plan is to get out of here my plan is not to be here when the bombs fall and you got to know what part you play your bride or I'm bride but am I a wife yet I'm looking at y'all are you a wife yet a wife is mature a bride's brand new a wife is maturity that's what he calls for in Revelations 19 that's another thing an end time scripture that we can look at that's pertinent to us so now look in Luke 8:14 and that which fell among Thorns as they which as he's talking about planting seed it came up when they heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life you see that more in this age than ever before why because we're living through it people will wait till Sunday to do something right brother klie that was not in our vocabulary when I was going to church my daddy worked his fingers of the bone six days that's right we going to church on Sunday it didn't matter hurricane high water but now people like well I got to go on Sunday I got to do this on Sunday and I know y'all have to travel and we got vacations and I do the same thing but just to wait till Sunday to oh shoot I got to change my oil my car like I do it for Monday cuz I can't get to work try doing it on Saturday well well listen this is scripture being fulfilled yes this is scripture talking about somebody that this is happening to this is not somebody or another age This Is Us blind riched miserable naked and don't know it right when they heard it they're choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring forth no fruit to protect Perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience Hebrews 6 verse1 say therefore leaving the principles the Cornerstone where we got to leave that corner part of that building you can go outside and say I'm going to build me a house Lay Your Foundation move in yeah brother John we're going to get couch and the bedroom's right over there so just go and put the over there well man you don't even have a house I got it all no you ain't you just starting to build therefore leaving the principles the Cornerstone of the doctrine of Christ now listen that's not leaving it and saying we don't need it no more that's building on itall let us go on unto Perfection headstone son of man are the finisher listen folks this is the finisher of it all now listen when we leave out of here there will be a message that goes to two witnesses that goes to 144,000 but Gentiles the people you rub shoulders with the people you do business with the people that you talk to if they're not bride they're Canon fodder and when that Gentile age is over the bombs are going to fall so this is the finisher yes sir for me and you this is it there's nothing else coming that'll make you different I said this coming it's already here this should make us different right so that word means Perfection means a perfector one who has in his own person raised Faith to its Perfection do you really believe this message is right then we must do what it says on the books and the tapes that's and so set before us the highest example of faith and that's another thing I was going to cover brother R said we we sin every day now remember what is sin unbelief so we unbelieve every day don't tell me you do oh no I believe everything everything perfect well let's go back to the liar part you lied so you sined okay preach Regina I believe we will but our highest example of faith is in the word of God now it says example so that's us the highest example is the word of God if we have faith in the word of God we should be able to do what it says I know we fail miserably but let's at least try not laying again the foundation now what is what is Paul telling us we're not God's not going backwards amen he sent us a message he sent us a I'm sorry he sent us a prophet with a message to deliver to a fivefold Ministry to deliver to the leoty for us to be raptured with changed and raptured with that's what it is in a nutshell not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works other words don't go backwards and a faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment this we will do if God permit you know there was Jun was listening or watching somebody online the other day makes a good point everybody listen cuz it's true sounds strange but it's true all right everybody listening pin yourself take the pencils you're writing with and stick it in your ear um we say all right we say that when we put it under the blood ask God to forgive us we put it under the blood remember he said don't drag it back out amen now I want to ask you a question I'm going be real serious with you when you come up here and testify of what you did in your past life you have pulled it back out from under the blood think about it you did it God don't remember it no more why don't we testify testify about what God's doing now forgetting the past don't drag that back up I'm don't I'm not going to come up here and when I tell y'all okay I say look we had a BC we had a before Christ life okay we did the things of the world but I'm not giving you names places and the things I did cuz I put that under the blood we have put that under the blood yes we got before God and we put everything we had before God and between me and you and everything we did and all that before we did what you know got married before we when we started getting when we got born again I did before she did but we started getting things right start off right but listen God forbid let me tell you something don't you ever bring your past life up to your wife or husband when you're mad at them yeah don't get don't get quiet on me you've never done that before I'm sorry I'm in the wrong I'm in the wrong group when I said that Susan lean this way away from Donnie truth hurts but it's the truth let's don't drag these things back out you're the you're the problem then that's right you are not somebody you mad at you're the problem you've drug it back out from under the blood let's don't do that anymore let's testify of great things that God's done yes that's right amen I'm not testifying about my past it's gone prise the Lord let's don't go fishing right and that sea so that's just a little pointer that um that June was sharing with me that she had heard and it's true and the minister say why do we drag those things out why do we bring them back even in conversation why do we and I do and I've done it you know I had a beer over here I had a this over there let's don't bring that up no more that to to God that never happened so let's just keep it over there of the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment this we would do if God permit now remember real simple when you say he's the Chief Cornerstone that's what the Bible calls him right precious they stumble at The Stumbling on who Christ they stumble at Christ listen they stumble at you right why do you go to church all the time why do you have to wear your dresses like you do why do you why do you man not have a beer on the afternoon when you have you know hard work and you I want one that's what you do that's what you want to say brother John you want to say that's what you do that's not what I do I don't do that no more so the Cornerstone the church Ages was partial understanding even in the first first because even Paul said I look through a glass Darkly Paul said I don't see all things but I see Jesus Paul didn't know anything about the seals Paul knew about good living Paul knew about all those things but he didn't know about that seals was going to change his body cuz he preached about it we which alive and remain he knew there was a revelation there but he knew he wasn't going to get to it you and I are going to fulfill that scripture amen but the headstone that we're getting to transition in to is the son of man revelation God back in human flesh again the Perfection tell me one one thing Jesus Christ did that was wrong now the Bible said he was perfect example the perfect example okay so now when we get him back on the scene in his fullness there'll be a perfect church right all right is everybody with me now look down Through the Ages we had reformers not prophets reformers and each office carries US own work not denying reformers but that's what we don't need somebody to reform us cuz if you get reformed you'll go do it again right but when the real thing is to be revealed at the last day of the last part of the church is when God has said that he would send us according to the scriptures and we've searched it through and through that he predicted that the spirit of alive Elijah would return in some person person but it'll be properly identified you know what Elijah was and watch that look the elect will know not the others they sure won't do it they'll miss it a million miles for seal look not under the revelation of the lon age or the first age the early church now look not though it was a great age though it was all great people not beling them at all they had their place but they were not required to come to Perfection like me and you the next age was the age of the ox which is the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as what it was nor the manlike Beast of wisdom Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Luther and Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age not the L ofan age the prophetic age L to see is blind riched miserable naked I thought we'd been called out of that there is to rise prophetic utterance to whom the secrets always come so Malachi 4 we'll read the part that's pertinent to us and he'll turn the heart one heart not Hearts heart heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse you know Israel believes they they are looking for Elijah that's why when Elijah steps over there with Moses they're like we have arrived CU every year they have their Sedar and they look they go outside and they look for Elijah cuz right here in Malachi 4 their Prophet Malachi they say speaking to them that before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord are Smite the Earth with a curse I'm going to send you an a so that's who they're looking for and that's what they're going to get the spirit of Elijah on somebody and I believe they're both over there right now that's how close we are so William brandham took Pentecostal babies to maturity he tried he tried his whole message from 47 to 63 but when he got up to 62 and 63 spoke the words Ral seed he'd say things like I'm going to lose a th000 friends um marriage and divorce I'm going to lose 100,000 friends and he did he lost a lot of people when he started bringing his message listen Jesus lost a lot of people when he started saying I am my father are one God bless whoever that is wreck or whatever but Jesus stood one day and he said I am of my father and you are of yours yes they knew what he was saying cuz they said you being a man make yourself God no like I said before it was God showing himself that he was a man they just couldn't see it so that's the same way with us so he took Pentecostal bab to maturity now that wasn't I always go back to that and and you may not you may not agree but I always go back to me it's a hinge point in his ministry when he preaches the seals he preaches all of them but but and preaches to number six and then he has questions and answers all right to me this is what brother brandham is telling hisself they're not getting it that's what he said remember right before he on questions and answers he said you're not getting this he said it's not even for you I'll read it later on in when we get into the seal he said it's not even for you congregation hundreds of people 300 people he say it's not even for you he said just live a good simple Christian Life in other words you're going to pass away in other words you're not getting you you're getting the healing you're getting the god in my soul I'm a newborn I'm a newborn creature in Christ and all that you're getting that but you're not getting what you're supposed to be getting you and I were supposed to been sitting in that audience and he wouldn't have said that right oh don't don't get quiet or would you sit there today just like that it is when pre when he preaches oh no he's the prophet there's a difference between a gift of Prophecy and Prophet I already told you that so let's continue on now look you say all right well tell me since we are coming to the fullness what do we got to do because remember the Holy Ghost is perfect amen and he was sent to make you and I perfect right so brother B say look we need something to work on before the Holy Ghost can ever go to work he's got to have something to work with that's right that's why when a denomination denominates around as Methodist did sprinkling God left amen the Holy Ghost couldn't work under that false Doctrine okay so it moved over to the Baptist the Baptist says well we baptized but we believe there's a trinity Holy Ghost said okay that's fine I'll wink at that but I'm moving on I'm looking for somebody that wants to be perfect if we're not it folks then all y'all we go everyone in this 80 people is going to pass on and another group's coming I don't believe that I don't believe that no more I'm standing here somebody is going to catch this thing and let the Holy Ghost have something to work with you know that's right oh this phic age that we're living in I tell you I'll never let a seventh grade dummy tell me I came from so and so I got a college education but you haven't got gumption enough to know how to control it wow let's continue on so Revelation 3:14 this is the the um announcement to the age until the Angel of the Church of the L of ss remember it tells you different than the other five the alpha bride is of and this bride is of if you reading your Bible these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness now watch what is the beginning of the creation of God what is that is when Jesus was formed in the womb of Mary no sex creative act spoken word she agreed with the spoken word and God planted the seed and the egg that was the beginning so what is this telling us since we're over here why is it telling us over here he's telling me that that creation that begun 2,000 years ago is now right here amen and it's birthing a group of people that should have been birthed that way had there not been a fall that's right right we've come back to that we have actually come across the chasm Brother Richard Wilson said look Satan put us on this side or we did by our choice but God is trying to put us back into the right place so under this ministry of the end time it's telling us what in the world is the beginning of the creation of God it's you and me and it's us in Perfection yes let's don't read all that let's continue on here look the amen is the last this is Brother R's commentary he's appeared all the way down through and different things but here's the last Church age this is the finish I am the last now to show that he was the first also as he was he's the beginning of the creation of God back over here do you catch it how could God be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's Eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was God at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him he is God's creation oh my see the first and last the amen the beginning of the creation of God when God created himself a body he came down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of God oh isn't he wonderful so what do we what have we come back to we've come back to by the new birth that's you right yes you are now the beginning of the creation of God you so I yeah you still got this Old Shell but that was because of the fall but inside your soul God bire you without sex he birthed you by the word of God the way it should have been that Genesis one come on somebody that Genesis 126 man is alive and well sitting here standing here today it's right here in you it's not with you listen genesis6 is not an anointing it's a person it's his bride it's his people it's me and you today it's not an anointing no Satan can give you an anointing but I promise you he can't give you that Genesis 13 and6 man that's right Genesis 126 man didn't come from God it is God everybody with me and I am the beginning of the creation of God through the church ages that were to have you learn that I am God now watch God created in a man form I'm the beginning of the creation of God now over here that would make a presbyterian shout just think of it beginning of the creation of God oh I like that oh I like that when God was created when God was made flesh in Jesus Christ and dwelt Among Us now remember John 1:14 and that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now I said before and I'm going to say it again that wasn't 2,000 years ago that wasn't one moment but it's right here today the word today is made flesh when you get born again your word your flesh has become the word of God you say oh my flesh you can say what you want to you're not your Soul's not over there that's right your Soul's inside of you today am so now the transition to Perfection has begun give me about 15 more minutes birth pains now watch now notice each age Rock the church and give it birth pains now listen no other age Jesus said you're lukewarm cold and Powerless he said you got this to do I'm going to give you this I'm going give you this star I'm going to give you this I'm going to give you these things you're going to do these things you're going to be a pillar all right age blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it all right so but every age had a power it had an anointing to bring us so that you and I could stand today and look back at that anointing of Luther Wesley different ones now watch after the birth Pains come instead of going on with the word they got a bunch of men together just like the first one did back in the first age right it's exactly right after the rocking of the apostles then we find her going off again then we find out Along come many of the others agabus and many of the Great reformers came back in the beginning each age had done as you study the preia council the Nia fathers and all back you find it all in there each age was rocked every time a messenger come forth would thus sayith the Lord now she's in in the worst age according to the scripture that she's ever been we are in the Lan age a rich But Blind Church AIDs that don't know it listen Christianity has been so diluted you go tell somebody they're not a Christian today you go tell somebody they don't act like a Christian today and you'll probably find out there's still a little bit of U um fight left in them you can't tell people that you can't tell and like I said before they they diluted hell hell ain't hell ain't nothing anymore the devil's a kind guy he's good no he's never he listen he's a destroyer always has been always will be God's Eternal always has been always will be now there wasn't nowhere in the Bible that Christ was ever put out of the church church but the lay out of sin age she's in the worst age she's the rottenest she ever was said I said as a queen having need of nothing and don't you know that you're naked miserable blind poor and don't know it yes sir I counsel thee come by isav from me we know where that isav is it's this message of the hour that it might open your eyes and it'll certainly the isav of God will certainly bring light to the church if it wants to open its eyes to what God has said notice quickly now now she's in that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt we're in the L of in church age now her messenger is promised now watch in Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word all right birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from a cour to Malachi 4 now some of you might have got born again out in the other Church ages out the other churches I'm talking about denominations and I can go with that you it's up to you but hearing the truth of this word of God that's what bir me that's what got my attention this messag so there's a now look she be delivered of a new birth not a different birth no it's not different you still got to go through justification satification but we know those stages now we know what to do you you should know sitting here today whether you're born again or not she used to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 in the church world today there's two systems working now listen real close now I want you to see if you're going to say Amen on this there's two systems working in the church world today I'm going to get this off my shoulder and then I have it over with we all know that that's the word of God and the denomination system two systems denomination word of God Amen there's the two systems that work just as they were Jacob and Esau one after the spirit one after the Flesh and what was it Esau and Jacob were fighting in the womb of the mother even to the time they were born and so is the denomination aals and the word fighting one against the other they have been since Luther first brought the First Reformation I hope that's simple enough that you can understand it and I highlighted that now watch these men he's talking about preachers or ministers these men if they pick up this now you see how that word this is capitalized that means this message right it wasn't just a this if they pick up this and goes out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seed then hoping they make it come to life a group of people that's going to be a voice of the messenger in the final age but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel when he shall begin to sound a mystery one mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets there it is brother Brown said he's sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years Paul he is sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that as John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God right and have thus sayith the Lord look and speak for God do you believe that you believe we've heard the voice of God in the end time I do and he's speaking to me he's not speaking to you he will be God's mouthpiece and has he as it is declared in Malachi 46 will turn the hearts of the children back to to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform Capital H so it's not brother brandham that's God perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it let's continue on it's just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes look by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will be in its last Church age when that messenger of Malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole Bible from Genesis Revelations now we believe that God did that right through a prophet right he will start at the serpent seed and Carry On To The Messer in the latter rign but he will be rejected by the denominations he has to be for that is history repeating itself from the time of Ahab Israel's history under Ahab is happening right here in America where the prophet of Malachi appears he's telling you where he's at in America where this Prophet amalaki for appears as Israel left Egypt to Worship in Freedom pushed out the natives raed raised up a nation with great leaders like David Etc then put an Ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same thing in America our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in Freedom they pushed back the natives and took over the land mighty men like Washington and Lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon as Ahab was set in the presidential chair you know what he's talking about right John F Kennedy and Jezebel was whatever what was her name Jackie Jackie that's who he's talking about if y'all didn't know that and the presidential chair was a Jezebel behind him to direct him is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi 4 must come then in the latter rain will come in Mount Carmel Showdown now what's the latter rain Harvest rain stick with me just for a minute now look watch this carefully now to see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organization of his death day everybody with me remember he's Elijah number three brother Brown was number four one coming is number five all right first two was Elijah and Elisha he planted the former rain now watch the former rain that's when you plant you plant have a rain on it brings a crop up latter rain is the last rain you get before you harvest it because it pops everything out all right that's what we're under now he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organization of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter rain the second Forerunner that's him that's brother brandham remember he was on the river down there Ohio River and the and the angel come and said as John the Baptist came to forrun the first coming of Christ your message will forrun the second coming of Christ remember what the angel said he didn't say you he said your message it's all in the message we know they're the same but brother random can make a mistake as human being the word can't and we know that we know that he didn't but I'm just telling you we if people looked at the man and when he died they died their Revelation died when he died let's don't do that that's not God God doesn't want it that way the second Forerunner of Christ will s for the latter Reign Jesus will be the showdown between the den nominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture he's talking about right now this day that we're living in Jesus Will Be The Showdown what the son of man will be back in power and a group of people called a bride for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel Elijah the second was Mount Transfiguration Jesus and the third will be Mount Zion now where is Zion Zion's in heaven and we are the daughters of Zion this message will be to take us to Mount Zion there'll be a showdown you know what it's going to be the day you get your body changed will be The Showdown the day your body is changed right here on this Earth and all this sin and everything still going on that'll be The Showdown that will take Satan and show him where he's at you're nothing right now he promised in the last days what he would do and it sent them up us the message and this message would have the same identification as Elijah had as Elisha had as John the Baptist and it would turn the hearts of the people not to the denomination but back to the original Apostolic fathers back to the word how these things have been Vindicated how that in the sounding of the last Angel Revelations 10 days of the seventh angel these Mysteries why did the methodists do this and the Baptist Church of Christ Jehovah Witness do all that in other words what he's saying he's telling these people people the Baptist did this what he was telling was he said look Baptist you're good but you're wrong here matus you're good but you're wrong here Nazarene you're good but you're wrong here Pentecostals you're good but you're wrong here now look them Mysteries will be revealed in the last day now last day we're in the last day when the seventh Angels message not when he starts out doing this now here's where we're going to separate it and and this is where we'll begin next time a preach cuz remember brother ry's Ministry had what two parts all right there was a part over here there was a part over here all right that's what he's saying right here all right pay attention we'll be done just a second now when he start not when he starts out doing this in other words not when he starts out preaching but when he begins to sound his message not the years in preparation okay amen but when he begins to sound this way I'm going to say it the message right listen and and pay attention to what I'm saying to the very end all brother random did from 47 to 63 was bring us back to where Paul and him were right and where did they go they died they went by the grave they're waiting on us hello somebody all right that's what happened so there's got to be a second message come a prophetic message to a group of people that wasn't even there yet to carry this thing on not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries then will be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that Paradox 1965 healing is the children's bread we realize that it's in the atonement and the atonement first is applied to our soul we got to look at that amen healing is in lay on of hands all that's in the Bible but the healing of the soul is first right are the most important and healing has always forerun now watch this healing has always forerun every message all right and it's also been a means to gather people together many people will sponsor a healing meeting many will come to a healing meeting or to a song festival or a football game or when it comes to a poor lost soul to get saved there's not many people interested in that but that's the main thing Divine Healing and singing festivals and so forth as brother Bosworth used to say it's the bait on the hook now the bait doesn't catch the fish the hook does but the bait brings the fish close enough to take the bait and he gets the hook that's what he was trying they were trying to do when brother Brown was was trying he was he doing the healing campaigns he was trying to get him to see Jesus Christ they were just looking at brother Brandon and that's just the thing to get the people to listen a while till you can really present to them your message God has did that in every age through every age there's always been a healing campaign now watch here's the point I want to make right here and if it's a genuine healing campaign remember there's thousands of people impersonator impersonators a and all the different ones they weren't impersonators but they just had a healing message they had no message behind it and if it's a genuine healing campaign behind that campaign always is a message there never is a sign given just for a sign it's forerunning a message and I believe the same thing is 17 years ago 18 years ago that the Lord sent me out to start praying for the sick it made a great re Revival among the people many great Servants of God has went forth in a healing campaign uh but the healing campaign in itself if you'll stay in that same old trend of what you've always was there's something wrong listen folks we had a message we love you know what we love to hear the prayer lines a stimulation of of of sorry feelings I want to get what he said at first there's something wrong that healing campaign wasn't sent from God we still believe brother Brown was a prophet right okay that healing campaign wasn't sent from God it's got to attract attention first see get the attention and then there's a message Jesus when he went forth Healing The Sick he was a great prophet to all of them but when he began to tell them the truth of the Gospel who he was and what he came for then he was not popular after that and that's the way it's always been through every age it will continue that way anointing once at the end time when that church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done in its Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic what was Wesley a rebuke to the lutherans what was the Pentecostals a rebuke to rebuke to both of them where has the life gone now away from an organization no more Shu it's the grain what is it a rebuke to the Pentecostal seed to fulfill the scripture of this hour notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on not the first part listen folks real quick real quick just a regular born again Christian will do what the Bible say so brother Bown didn't tell us how to be how how to be a different type of Christian they all preached Jesus Christ they all preached you had to be saved they all preached you had to be filled with the Holy Ghost but but but the Baptist say shake a hand fill out a letter method said well you just had a feeling this and said this over here this and said you got to speak in tongues okay that's the man anointing that's going to get you somewhere yeah it's going to make you a Christian but it's not going to get you out of here right not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message yes see the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal we'll get into this a little bit later no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of those Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things just what I've been telling you we'll close right here one one according to Mali 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers what babies to maturity two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders nobody's ever done that before Jesus preached them but nobody's ever done it so they had to make they had to make sure that the son of man was back in the end time with no seals open two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 we'll get into that a little bit later which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals when the book opened it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so musicians come on y'all stand to your feet Listen to This Promise Daniel 12:4 now we know Daniel's a Jew but we're Jews spiritually amen but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end and many shall run to and fro in knowledge boy what about it we've had so much knowledge shall increase Daniel 12:7 and I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever that it shall be a time times and a half and we know that's to the Jews that's a three and a half year Ministry to the Jews but Daniel didn't know that but we do and swear by him that liveth forever it shall be for a Time 1 time 2 that's three and a half so three and a half year Ministry and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the Holy people all these things shall be finished and I heard but I understood not now there's Daniel Daniel was a prophet right he was a Jew but he was a prophet brother BR called him a prophet listen The Book of Daniel is the Book of Revelation to the Jews if you didn't know that read it the Book of Daniel is the Book of Revelations that we have over here this is for the Gentiles and the Book of Daniel is for what's going to happen during the Jew Jewish time time time and dividing of times and I heard but I understood not then said I oh my Lord what shall be the end of these things and God said go thy Way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end Daniel was a great man right he'll be there Paul was a great man he'll be there Luther was a great man he'll be there Wesley was a great man he'll be there but none of them preached in an open book not one of them went to the body change that's what we're looking for that's what brother brandham gave us this message not in the years of preparation not in the healing campaign not in the bait campaign the bait was to get them to listen but what the problem was they flip-flopped it you asked some of these brother George Canada said it himself and so did sister C they went to Jefferson bille to hear the prayer line they were so hooked on the prayer line they missed the message I don't say they missed the message went in sin they missed the they missed the time that should have been and that's what brother Brown said he said he said look he said you Pentecostal said you you've cabbaged down you've missed this this just a bait on the hook you should come to this message don't come listening for the healing campaign now you and I are under the greatest healing campaign that ever was all those people that got healed in brother the R's Ministry pretty much have all passed away healed of cancer cancers fall off in the floor uh a lady that weighed 75 PBS became a a robust woman again just like that healing Miracles you'll never hear of before but they're all passed away they got their part of message of the healing campaign right but this last part of this message is the greatest healing campaign that's ever been right now you're under the greatest healing campaign that's ever hit the face of the Earth well wait I yeah me too my leg's killing me right now so what your body is going to get healed because your soul is going to come out and change that thing not come out but work its way out and that's the greatest healing that's ever been because remember the healing of your soul is eternal but when your body gets changed it's going to be changed into something temporary no it's going to be changed into something Eternal and that's the second part of the message that brother Brandon brought was to take a bride from where they were and bring them into the most mature bride that's ever been the wife that's made herself ready and got a body changed cuz by Revelations 19 when that voice says his wife has made herself ready your body's been changed hello your body's been changed right there because we going to step right into the Millennium we don't have a body change here you want to sing a song yeah okay okay we'll do that you love the Lord we appreciate you I need to get this up I want you to pay attention to this message of the hour it's not just God sent a prophet it's not just that we're we're sitting here because we heard of William brandom and and I've seen it I've seen it I've seen it I remember I was a little kid when we first came into message but I've seen it and heard it most people in this message especially back then especially back then had the attitude that I got something you don't have come on some of you shaking your head some of you not yeah it is it's I've got this some secret thing and I got it but you don't have it but if you'll come over here and listen to me I'll tell it to you the only person that can give you a revelation of a mystery is Jesus Christ if it's anything else it's the devil just PL this day I got a revelation one day that I was lost that's the greatest Revelation I've up until this this moment that I'll ever have is that I was lost and I needed salvation I I didn't need a I didn't need a great father come on now I didn't need a great father that was a minister he can't save me my mama can't save me brother brandham can't save me Jesus Christ is the only thing can save you now if you're born again as we said before this messenger of Malachi 4 we're going to be birthed under that anointing of Malachi 4 we'll have a birth from According to Malachi 4 you and I are growing now under the Malachi 4 anointing okay cuz brother B's gone so it's the days of the voice but the days of the voice is going to produce a group of people listen if it stays a voice it's like I said you can say this message all you want to but if you live it different story Satan can quote listen Satan has already quoted every quote ever was in his message he's quoted the Bible the Bible says the Devils believe in one God and tremble so where are we at we're part of the mystery we'll get into that we're part of the mystery of the end time and we've got to be made known this world is going to see the culmination of William bram's message in a group of people I promise you it's thus sayth the lord it's it can't stay on paper it can't stay in quotes it can't stay on tape right it's got to come off of that and live inside of you to where you got to say that ain't nothing but the truth brother BR said the the the the the bride would have thus sayth the Lord are keep still you say oh well now that's only for a prophet I'm telling you what the prophet said you'll have thus sayith the Lord or you'll keep still and I believe we have thus sayith the Lord because if we say if we stay with the Bible it's thus sayith the Lord amen let's sing a song then I want sister uh Zoe and and Bella to sing a song for us before we [Music] leave with bleeding stri Paul and let's pray that night and in their pain they began to sing oh what will singing Do singing will bring the anointing what did he do with David something to get on Old Saul devil would get on Saul he bring David in to play the heart the evil spirits would Le that's why we sing songs bless your name sing it to him I give you all give you praise you are the L the truth the way sing it to him bless your name I bless your name listen now midnight now this is personal this is to you we can be that I've been a prisoner in my own mind before I know you have too in your mind
