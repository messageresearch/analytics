[15:45] 4 Heavenly Father we thank

[15:52] you have given it unto us and in that
[15:56] you've given us a word a Time that we
[15:59] could receive and Lord that we could
[16:03] follow after you and to know the hour
[16:05] that we're living to recognize our our
[16:07] day and its message the time and what
[16:09] we're to be making manifest we pray that
[16:12] you would just come on the scene now and
[16:14] honor your word as we read it and you'd
[16:18] reach down and touch the sick among us
[16:20] because you promised it and we believe

[16:24] you and we thank you guide us now and

[16:29] in your love in Jesus name
[16:32] amen
[16:34] Romans
[16:39] 11 in verse
[16:42] 25 for I would not Brethren that you
[16:45] should be ignorant of this this mystery
[16:47] lest you should be lest you should be
[16:49] wise in your own conceits that blindness
[16:52] and part has happened to Israel unto
[16:53] fullness of the Gentiles be in and so
[16:56] all Israel shall be saved as it is
[16:59] written there shall come out as Z to
[17:01] deliver and shall turn away ungodliness
[17:03] from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto
[17:06] them when I shall take away their sins
[17:09] as concerning the gospel they are
[17:11] enemies for your sakes but as con
[17:14] touching the election they are beloved
[17:17] for the father's sake why after all of
[17:20] the ways and thinking about the Jews and
[17:23] what's happened and the the uh the parts
[17:27] that's been there you know and how
[17:28] they've been and all and
[17:31] uh to think that God would sum it up
[17:35] here by Paul saying for the gifts and
[17:38] callings of God are without repentance
[17:40] and that would truly be right right that
[17:43] it wouldn't be something that we could
[17:44] do or whatever it' be without repentance
[17:48] Ephesians
[17:50] 4:7 but unto every one of us is given
[17:53] Grace according to the measure of the
[17:55] gift of Christ wherefore he saith when
[17:58] he ascended up on high he led captivity
[18:01] captive and gave gifts unto men now that
[18:04] he ascended what is it but that he also
[18:07] descended first into the lower parts of
[18:09] the earth he that descended is the same
[18:12] also that as ascended up far above all
[18:15] Heavens that he might fill all things
[18:18] and he gave some Apostles and some
[18:20] prophets and some evangelists and some
[18:22] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[18:25] of the Saints for the work of the
[18:26] ministry for the edifying of the the
[18:28] body of Christ till we now that's a
[18:31] state a place when you would come forth
[18:34] and say something's going to happen and
[18:36] then you'll say till we come it's
[18:39] stating that it's going to happen amen a
[18:43] set time you know it's going to happen
[18:45] till we all come into the unity of the
[18:47] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[18:49] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[18:51] of the stature or the fullness of Christ
[18:53] that we henceforth be no more children
[18:55] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[18:57] every when of Doctrine but by the slight
[19:00] of of Doctrine by the slight of men and
[19:03] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[19:05] weight to deceive but speaking the truth
[19:08] in love may grow up into him in all
[19:11] things which is the head even Christ For
[19:15] Whom the whole body fitly joined
[19:18] together and compacted by that whichever
[19:20] joint suppli and once that because every
[19:23] place is me and every gift is important
[19:25] all right according to the effectual
[19:27] work
[19:28] in the measure of every part making
[19:31] maketh interess make excuse me increase
[19:34] of the body unto the edifying of itself
[19:36] in love you may be seated the Lord had
[19:39] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[19:43] now try not to back up too far but recap
[19:47] just a little bit of this morning and
[19:49] then you know try to come down to the to
[19:52] the point
[19:55] that of what we're saying of the gifts
[19:58] and callings of God now the prophet said
[20:02] we don't you don't repent to get a
[20:05] gift it's not something like that it's
[20:07] not something that you don't have and
[20:10] then you can go do something you know in
[20:13] joining a church become a Christian
[20:16] Etc uh and then you get a gift see
[20:20] that's like passing out things so we
[20:22] don't believe in passing out gifts and
[20:24] even though it sounds like it as we gave
[20:26] this morning in Paul that you know from
[20:29] the laying on the hands and things but
[20:30] that's really to stir up the gift you
[20:33] know in the person it stir it's it puts
[20:36] it into motion to bring it into a place
[20:40] to where that it can be used of God
[20:43] because what we want to do is see even
[20:45] though our gift the gift is there when
[20:47] you're
[20:48] lost and uh you know you could do this
[20:51] that the other different things in there
[20:53] but when you become a Christian you want
[20:55] everything to turn towards God
[20:58] and and you know doing for him so then I
[21:02] you know whatever you would have as
[21:04] ability to speak well then see you want
[21:07] that turned over
[21:08] into uh the the gospel of the word to be
[21:12] able to express it and and help the
[21:15] people to understand you know and and
[21:18] that would be good because that would be
[21:20] your gift and it wouldn't be then
[21:21] something that you could go to school to
[21:24] learn because you know like we were in a
[21:27] meeting one time and and this brother he
[21:29] was saying you know you do this and you
[21:31] do that and you do this and you brother
[21:33] dick punched me and he said he he's been
[21:35] trained ain't he get everybody involved
[21:37] and all well then when I got up behind
[21:39] him and spoke he come to me later and he
[21:42] said I went to school a long time he
[21:45] said but you got it natural and see well
[21:48] that was the way it was supposed to be a
[21:51] gift is supposed to be something natural
[21:53] not something you work up but something
[21:55] you're born with into where you can can
[21:58] and be able to help people with it all
[22:00] right now we've talked about and for
[22:02] months and months and months been on
[22:05] predestination that the prophet says 154
[22:08] Church age book that it's not the person
[22:10] that comes predestinated eternally from
[22:13] God but it's the word or seed all right
[22:17] then coming into the gifts and callings
[22:20] of God calling of God and and saying
[22:25] that you know there are there and and
[22:28] God is ordained it to
[22:31] be then we're not trying to uh be
[22:36] anything ourselves we're trying as I
[22:37] said a moment ago to yield ourselves and
[22:40] let that gift work in our lives for his
[22:44] benefit because why because the gift is
[22:46] him anyway it's not you and I uh even a
[22:50] gift of playing a guitar or or piano or
[22:53] whatever you know a real gift not the
[22:56] trained things and all the
[22:58] but the real gift I is an ability just
[23:01] to relax a little bit and everything
[23:04] flows you know and it ain't like me with
[23:06] 14 thumbs you know and that's why I tell
[23:09] you I don't do no text messages and
[23:11] stuff cuz my fingers are too big to to
[23:14] get on and you know the telephone ain't
[23:16] big enough I need one about this big you
[23:19] know but see if you got a gift then use
[23:23] the
[23:24] gift we believe in gifts I believe in
[23:26] them here I I've never set anybody down
[23:29] for speaking in tongues even in the
[23:32] congregation let it go and see and then
[23:34] we will put it in order by the prophet
[23:36] and then it'll work out you know and we
[23:39] don't have any problems with it cuz
[23:41] that's uh I won't have to answer for the
[23:43] fact of of regulating orever what you
[23:46] call it controls on you uh because
[23:49] you're the one that's doing that in
[23:51] yourself but we we believe in all of the
[23:54] gifts but we're trying to see that all
[23:58] gifts come from God Amen right what
[24:01] would be coming from the devil we don't
[24:03] want that anyway and and no matter what
[24:06] that he would even work because the
[24:08] Bible and the prophet says there's only
[24:10] two powers and that's God's power and
[24:13] Satan don't have any but he said it's
[24:16] what God permits him to have so it's not
[24:19] a power it's not everything you know and
[24:22] and he's got as I said this morning the
[24:25] scripture says that he has uh angels
[24:28] that are ministering spirits and
[24:30] preachers in other words to to go forth
[24:33] and do things but watch them they'll
[24:35] always preach era right they may go a
[24:38] long while but just keep following it
[24:40] you'll finally see it drop off and it
[24:42] it'll produce what it is because they
[24:44] can't follow into God if it's a true
[24:46] gift of God it's going to honor
[24:49] God all right so whatever God you get
[24:52] your gift from you're going to honor
[24:53] that God all right and and and in doing
[24:57] it but now
[24:58] now then it's the word or person that
[25:02] comes predestinated
[25:05] eternally you know not the word of not
[25:08] the person but the word of word that
[25:09] becomes predestinated Eternal and the
[25:12] for knowledge lets God know where that's
[25:14] going to drop who it's going to be in
[25:17] and and that'll work in his for
[25:18] knowledge but then we went through this
[25:21] morning talking about Jesus Christ God
[25:24] himself that that's not uh he's not a
[25:28] uh a gift he's the person it's not a
[25:32] gift of God and the Bas is when it says
[25:34] the the the gift of God is eternal life
[25:37] that's not a gift of God like a gift
[25:39] that God has and he passes them out and
[25:42] you know this and he does that and does
[25:44] that it's himself coming and living in
[25:47] you and I to give us eternal life it's
[25:50] his own life it's not our lives and we
[25:53] should be very careful about what we do
[25:55] with them with the gifts and the things
[25:57] like that you know to keep it because we
[25:59] want to make sure to be right see Jesus
[26:02] then as I said this morning come
[26:03] predestinated
[26:06] eternally all right he didn't have to be
[26:09] a for knowledge forn knowledge sure he
[26:12] understood and he knew what would take
[26:13] place but it was already in his plan and
[26:17] purpose before he started thinking about
[26:20] what the Earth would be like in what
[26:23] would take place if you want to call it
[26:24] that way he already was a a part of God
[26:28] because he was God all right then if
[26:32] it's a true gift that we
[26:35] have then that true gift is a part of
[26:39] God now we're going to get on over into
[26:42] a little bit of doing it but do you
[26:44] understand what I'm saying the
[26:46] difference between Jesus and you and
[26:49] I is the fact that he was predestinated
[26:53] eternally all right now and I'm talking
[26:57] about Jesus Christ see because you come
[26:59] all the way through the Old Testament
[27:00] with the Christ coming out into Jesus
[27:02] and Jesus Christ all right but see you
[27:05] and
[27:06] I is predestinated about forn knowledge
[27:09] about the person you're looking
[27:11] at but the gift of God is predestinated
[27:14] eternally amen all right now that's
[27:17] where we have to decide because that's
[27:19] where that uh you know I was looking and
[27:22] I I didn't bring a lot of them because
[27:25] that it would reflect and people would
[27:27] think think you're trying to boost
[27:29] yourself up or something I didn't write
[27:31] the book I didn't write the Bible I
[27:33] didn't preach the prophet's message but
[27:35] I can read you know what he says about
[27:38] honoring the gifts and God will honor
[27:41] you and all like that that's that's the
[27:44] doing and that's all I've ever asked you
[27:46] to do is not to honor me as the flesh
[27:49] because I've got all I take have need of
[27:53] you know I don't have to worry about it
[27:55] and all but I want you to honor the gift
[27:58] because that way the gift can help you
[28:02] and you should do that in any Minister
[28:04] and not look at the person because you
[28:06] can look at the person and
[28:07] fail you know uh you can see things you
[28:11] don't want to
[28:12] see uh doing it but it's like brother
[28:15] Brandon said Isaiah he said there he was
[28:17] of that great things of being like he
[28:19] was to speak but said he was an ordinary
[28:22] person the Bible says about Elijah you
[28:24] know he's a man of like passion in other
[28:26] words a being right but now do you
[28:30] understand the difference between God
[28:31] and a
[28:34] prophet God is the prophet that's who he
[28:37] is he is the son of man he's the Lord
[28:39] Jesus Christ he's God himself all right
[28:42] and that's more important than anything
[28:45] else and the reason it's called a gift
[28:47] is because it's given right now if the
[28:51] gift if the Bible's right it says the
[28:53] gift of God is eternal life then that
[28:54] means that there was a time you didn't
[28:56] have it right amen well why does
[28:58] everybody want to deal with you know
[29:00] always was and all like that without
[29:03] understanding right the eternal life of
[29:07] God always was eternal amen all right so
[29:10] then that would put your gift in the
[29:13] eternity back together in the form of
[29:15] the
[29:17] word the word as we were saying this
[29:19] morning the prophets were
[29:22] predestinated right that's
[29:26] wonderful because they were bringing the
[29:29] word
[29:31] right one Prophet would speak of
[29:33] something like there was one there and I
[29:35] maybe right on it close yeah uh where
[29:38] it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[29:40] today and forever right about where we
[29:41] ended up and he's talking about nobody
[29:44] had to
[29:46] do in other words they didn't have
[29:48] nothing to do with God made him a
[29:50] prophet before he was born talking about
[29:54] Moses to fulfill Abraham
[29:58] promise so each one was promising the
[30:01] next to come the next to come to build
[30:03] the body of Christ that would come forth
[30:06] and and be the the correct things and
[30:10] and that way you wouldn't have a high
[30:12] parts and leave off this or leave that
[30:14] you would be lined up in the correct
[30:16] order all right now works as Faith
[30:20] Express he says there was no question
[30:23] why the ground in his heart was a
[30:25] predestinated person
[30:28] gifts and callings are repentance God
[30:30] had told Abraham he would do that and
[30:33] there was the ground prepared so Moses
[30:37] could just lean back and depend upon God
[30:41] and let God do it and he waited upon God
[30:45] and that's that's one of the things it's
[30:47] hard for people to comprehend the things
[30:50] that brother brandham would
[30:52] say because God choose Moses out one day
[30:55] for not just speaking and going to H
[30:58] did but yet he wasn't chewing him out cu
[31:01] he wasn't waiting on him he was chewing
[31:03] him out because he didn't you know he
[31:04] said why cist speak in other words I've
[31:07] ordained you I've given you all that's
[31:09] been done you've let them out this so
[31:11] far speak it and go on Amen don't wait
[31:14] around to do just get up and go on all
[31:17] right because even brother randam when
[31:19] he'd come down to speaking the
[31:21] word remember that speaking the word of
[31:25] the five times we talk about you know a
[31:27] different he said it was sovereignly
[31:29] given that's right so we don't go out
[31:32] and speak our own words I've got one in
[31:34] here somewhere word the brother around
[31:36] said only a prophet has a right to say
[31:38] thus sayith the Lord because a prophet
[31:41] then is speaking as God's mouthpiece see
[31:45] when you say thus sayith the Lord that
[31:46] means somebody else is speaking through
[31:48] you all right but the court trial as we
[31:50] were on this morning says all prophets
[31:54] are
[31:56] predestinated
[31:58] all right gifts and callings without
[32:00] repentance Jeremiah you know God goes
[32:03] through those things he said the gifts
[32:05] and callings aren't laying hands
[32:08] on one another it's what God
[32:13] does it's what God
[32:16] does it's not you and I can pass them
[32:18] out it's what God does all right those
[32:22] prophets would pick up the thought of
[32:24] God as Moses and then he would bring it
[32:28] in it becomes Moses thought that's how
[32:31] close it is to the man but yet then he
[32:34] would speak and it would become a
[32:36] word but when Moses would his brother BR
[32:39] said when he stepped forward to speak he
[32:41] was God to the people but when he steps
[32:42] back he's Moses but now Jesus wasn't God
[32:45] to the people and stepped back and was a
[32:48] man he was the man Christ Jesus all
[32:51] right see the prophet then would be in a
[32:54] a different form but yet being used
[32:58] watch what he says on perseverance but
[33:01] my gift comes from God because I love
[33:03] him and this I believe gifts and
[33:06] callings are without repentance they're
[33:09] predestinated of God they're each
[33:13] generation and my part in this was to be
[33:17] was to that word for it to live again
[33:22] because the word to discern and know
[33:26] that's Pro prophetic which is Promised
[33:29] according to Malachi 4 to be in this day
[33:32] makes us perfectly in the last day all
[33:35] right see then the word coming to Isaiah
[33:38] to
[33:39] bring the word itself was
[33:42] God the gift was God the man was human
[33:46] brother brandham said he was one that
[33:49] was standing by that was being used see
[33:52] go you go too far you go into deity
[33:55] right so you leave it the way it is
[33:57] the human body of brother brandham was
[33:59] not deity God but the God that was in
[34:03] him in the New Birth was deity the god
[34:05] that's in You by the new birth is deity
[34:08] all right so then put that together with
[34:11] it and just remember then the
[34:14] gift the gift is what makes him greater
[34:18] than anyone else other than than regular
[34:20] things he's a normal person right right
[34:24] as I said a moment ago about Elijah or
[34:26] which one it says was a man of like
[34:27] passion in other words he was a person a
[34:29] human being just like anybody else he
[34:33] wasn't something special but yet the
[34:35] gift in his life
[34:37] made something very special because that
[34:40] was God using his Prophet all right
[34:43] that's what it's supposed to be then all
[34:45] right look what he says on do God change
[34:48] his mind 65 he said I am not he but I am
[34:53] his servant I do not believe that you
[34:55] lay hands on people and give them gifts
[34:57] gifts and callings are without
[34:59] repentance they are predestinated of God
[35:01] to meet the age and the time of that
[35:06] age right any Bible student knows that's
[35:10] the truth Moses was born just in time
[35:13] Jeremiah in time all the rest of them
[35:15] John the Baptist in time Jesus was in
[35:17] time and we're in
[35:19] time
[35:20] see all right so then keep the
[35:25] person separated from the
[35:29] Eternal Word that they're to bring
[35:31] that's right and that way we keep our
[35:33] all ourselves in line now one day when
[35:36] we leave out of
[35:38] here right okay when we leave out of
[35:41] here and go into eternity then we won't
[35:44] be dealing with having to you know when
[35:46] we're changed and made Eternal then you
[35:49] you can bring the whole person back
[35:51] together and bring it but we've got to
[35:53] keep it separated until that time comes
[35:56] because if not we're going into a deity
[35:58] form that you know would would make
[36:01] those things he said I am
[36:05] not the son of man he's the son of man
[36:10] right all right because he was the word
[36:13] but yet he was the part of the word for
[36:15] that
[36:16] age on the fifth seal he says talking
[36:18] about gifts and callings are
[36:20] predestinated of God they are they are
[36:23] God's gifts and callings even without
[36:26] repentance the Bible says he goes on
[36:29] down in a little bit and explains he
[36:31] said you mean before you was born he
[36:33] said yes the gift was there before you
[36:35] know born again the gift was di before I
[36:37] was born
[36:39] again all right then see we're we're
[36:42] dealing with something that that we're
[36:44] trying to
[36:46] separate from what we're looking at the
[36:48] natural Earthly thing and see what God
[36:51] is using mankind to
[36:54] do he's working through through
[36:57] mankind on the early Christian
[36:59] experience in 52 he
[37:03] says it's not in gifts and callings and
[37:06] things them things are that was made up
[37:09] back y before the world begun I can't
[37:12] get out of his predestinated will I want
[37:16] you I can't get out of his predestinated
[37:18] will he's already willed me what to
[37:21] do all right but it's just something I
[37:25] would like to do
[37:27] along another line in other words he
[37:28] said I just love to to help souls and
[37:31] not deal with gifts is what he goes on
[37:32] to explain but the understand what I'm
[37:35] trying to get
[37:36] to look at the next one lean not to your
[37:39] understanding it's like I said a gift is
[37:42] not something that's like you take a
[37:45] knife and if you want to cut
[37:48] this this with it you can cut it or you
[37:53] cut this you can cut it but list you see
[37:56] it's not you you but it's whatever you
[38:01] want see that's what we think a
[38:04] gift are you reading it's whatever we
[38:07] think whatever we whatever we want what
[38:09] we want to do with it we think that's a
[38:11] gift well I just go out and speak the
[38:14] word
[38:17] no you can speak presumptuously the
[38:19] Bible
[38:20] says right you might hit or
[38:24] miss but it's not that way but watch
[38:26] what he says that's not a gift of God
[38:29] that's you see it that's not a gift of
[38:32] God
[38:33] no it doesn't work that way a gift of
[38:36] God is some way you have of getting
[38:39] yourself out of the way
[38:42] all it's something you can do and you
[38:44] don't even have to repent to get that
[38:45] started it doesn't work that way right
[38:48] you can be chosen before the world and
[38:51] and the gift and everything already be
[38:52] working in your
[38:54] life before you become a Christian
[38:57] Christian that just activates it trying
[39:00] to say well to go towards God and allows
[39:01] him to use that part of you to where
[39:05] that he can can do it when I sat down to
[39:07] study for a
[39:09] message and you know I said Lord now you
[39:13] use me to express yourself to the
[39:17] people you know and and it's it's hard
[39:20] to explain uh gifts because of people
[39:25] that maybe it doesn't deal with them in
[39:27] that line but I try to make it as simple
[39:30] as I can you have a gift to play a piano
[39:33] you have a gift to sing you have a gift
[39:36] to uh uh clean houses you have a gift
[39:39] for this a gift for that and some people
[39:41] just can't do those things those are
[39:44] gifts all right think about all of the
[39:47] gifts of God that are given to us that
[39:50] God gave us that all then just trying to
[39:53] bring it on down and then we just start
[39:56] separating a little bit as to where uh
[40:00] you know it doesn't all flow together
[40:03] and we let God do it working in the body
[40:06] of
[40:07] Christ if there is nine spiritual
[40:12] gifts in the body all right then God
[40:16] wants to use
[40:17] those we read this morning where it was
[40:20] a sa Spirit you know working in each
[40:24] one it's God doing
[40:27] it all right but see then we just bring
[40:30] it along and just what I'm trying to do
[40:32] this afternoon is just separate just a
[40:34] little
[40:36] bit where that you'll
[40:38] see what my point
[40:41] is my point is that there's
[40:45] gifts and there's
[40:48] gifts there's gifts that is God himself
[40:52] working a gift through the promise in
[40:54] the word
[40:57] then there's gifts that is Promised in
[41:00] the word but promised to
[41:04] everybody you know anybody in the body
[41:07] of Christ is subject to a gift right
[41:09] amen all right Y and if we keep that in
[41:11] our mind it would help us to
[41:14] understand but then getting the point is
[41:17] what God
[41:20] does those prophets standing there until
[41:24] they would actually say like David
[41:26] singing in the spirit as sorry as a
[41:29] rascal as he was but yet he could enter
[41:31] the spirit of God and he would sing they
[41:33] pierce my hands and my feet you know the
[41:35] the the thing he would enter and
[41:37] actually speak in the first person right
[41:41] all right the first person was
[41:44] God right even balam
[41:47] right as bad as he was but the gift that
[41:51] was in him would speak as in the first
[41:55] person
[41:57] and is he would be put in the word as
[42:00] writing but yet him be false himself all
[42:04] right so then that way you separate the
[42:07] man from the
[42:09] gift we honor the gift without honoring
[42:13] the man too far but if we don't honor
[42:15] the man to a certain degree now we've
[42:18] gone
[42:20] wrong cuz we do honor it to a certain
[42:22] degree I I'm not don't do it church kids
[42:25] or whatever you you see somebody in
[42:27] church and they're shouting they're
[42:28] crying or speaking or the preachers a
[42:30] certain way don't make no Li about that
[42:33] don't do that
[42:35] now because that could be the spirit of
[42:38] God see and you you don't want to get in
[42:41] trouble with God about something you
[42:43] know just just let it go and say I just
[42:44] don't agree with that you know I mean
[42:48] you know when I when you ask me said
[42:49] what do you think about that brother so
[42:50] and so I said well I didn't agree with
[42:52] what he said but I'm not picking on him
[42:54] that's between him and God that's that
[42:56] that's that's not to me I'm not the
[42:59] judge we'll get to that in a minute
[43:01] where that there's gifts in the body you
[43:03] know the gifts in the body have to be
[43:05] judged right but you know prophets don't
[43:09] have to be
[43:13] judged there is no way to judge a
[43:17] prophet well we're going to get into
[43:19] 5old Ministry in a minute and I want you
[43:21] to show me how you can judge a five full
[43:23] ministry Ain but one way you can judge
[43:26] any man like that Prophet or fivefold
[43:28] minister is what he does with the
[43:31] word you can't judge anything else you
[43:34] judge him by what he does with the word
[43:35] or how that it fits the rest of the word
[43:37] now Prophet comes out and preaches
[43:39] presumptuously or he gives you a sign
[43:41] and it comes to P etc etc but he takes
[43:43] you to another God what do you do you
[43:44] get away from him all right so the same
[43:47] thing about a your pastor he's ordained
[43:49] to lead you through if he's ordained
[43:52] that's the only problem right you know
[43:55] I'm not not trying to expose anybody of
[43:58] any thoughts but I'm trying to expose
[44:00] the whole thing of to where that we can
[44:02] look at the word and see that we say but
[44:05] that brother that's his way of seeing it
[44:09] well the Bible's not made in the basis
[44:12] of his way of seeing
[44:14] it it's either God or it's not whether
[44:17] it be you me or who it is is you know so
[44:21] you know don't watch the actions of the
[44:23] person as much as you do what he does
[44:25] with the word now come on we're human I
[44:28] mean I go up here and preach to you like
[44:29] every and I go out and commit adultery
[44:31] and this that that's garbage can don't
[44:32] even think about it forget it that's
[44:35] right that proves I'm not a born again
[44:37] Christian let alone a preacher that's
[44:39] right see because we show our own
[44:42] sales all right but now all right do you
[44:46] understand now God himself is a gift the
[44:50] gift of God is eternal life through
[44:51] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ himself I'm
[44:54] using Jesus Christ as being almighty God
[44:56] now not just the
[44:59] flesh but the whole thing he was
[45:02] predestinated eternally from God all
[45:05] right and that word that God brings you
[45:08] remember a message we were trying to
[45:09] bring the other day about uh you know
[45:13] where Jesus said he said my words are
[45:16] spirit and they're
[45:19] life now to us we read it it's natural
[45:22] words right right I mean we read it it's
[45:25] natural words until it's revealed off
[45:28] the pages into our heart then when it is
[45:30] we see it like he saw
[45:33] it right then it becomes alive it's
[45:36] something to to do it but to get in now
[45:40] and think about then then the prophets
[45:42] of God being
[45:45] predestinated I'm sure God knew what age
[45:47] they would live in but he knew more than
[45:49] anything the word they would bring right
[45:52] all right he told Jeremiah I saw thee
[45:55] ordained thee before the world for
[45:59] knowledge come on if he's standing here
[46:01] and I say to to Sister M I've seen you
[46:04] downstairs while ago you know that means
[46:07] she's had to be downstairs while ago so
[46:08] that means the four knowledge is got to
[46:10] be working right so you see then the
[46:12] Bible is very simple if we get simple
[46:14] with
[46:15] it but we try to figure it
[46:20] out but now see then a
[46:23] prophet he's not judged I've got it in
[46:26] here somewhere but he's not
[46:30] judged you you don't judge him except
[46:32] for one thing if he says it it comes to
[46:37] pass you you you better believe it if he
[46:41] says it it don't come to P he's
[46:43] automatically judged
[46:44] himself right cuz he's off the word but
[46:48] see then that way he don't have to speak
[46:50] and go ask somebody else it okay for him
[46:51] to say that that's right or be judged
[46:55] whereas we get in a minute gifts when
[46:57] gifts operate then they have to be
[46:59] judged before they come before the
[47:00] congregation right all right and then
[47:03] see in doing that
[47:05] then it makes a distinction of a gift
[47:08] now we're going to get into it in a
[47:10] little bit in the fivefold ministry
[47:12] where brother Randon will be referring
[47:13] to church
[47:16] gifts and he will be referring to
[47:19] offices right the offices are different
[47:23] than Church
[47:24] gifts all right offices can be
[47:28] predestinated
[47:31] eternally prophets are God's
[47:37] mouthpiece the word they bring is
[47:40] predestinated
[47:42] eternally so they're in an office by
[47:45] themselves that's right the FF Ministry
[47:48] coming into the New Testament is not
[47:50] dealing as an Old Testament
[47:53] form it's dealing in a doings because
[47:56] that's why to brother brandham in other
[47:58] words why couldn't brother brandham do
[48:00] as he desired to do he's Old Testament
[48:03] prophet he could do it he could go into
[48:05] the Wilderness he could live with Elijah
[48:06] he could walk out when he wanted to walk
[48:08] out he could give thus sayth the Lord
[48:09] and go back in the
[48:11] wilderness and brother Rand wanted to do
[48:13] that right but yet God said you can't do
[48:17] it
[48:19] why why couldn't he do as that Prophet
[48:24] back there you ever thought of that why
[48:26] why couldn't he why couldn't brother
[48:28] brandham just go and come out you know
[48:31] then go back he wanted to do that he was
[48:35] showed you remember a big garbage
[48:37] burning pile and he said that's where
[48:39] you w that's the way you wind
[48:42] up why was it that he couldn't do
[48:45] that you don't think like that why I've
[48:49] got questions you know I like
[48:52] answers but see he is was in the family
[48:55] of
[48:57] God right the Old Testament prophets
[49:00] were not in the same family of God even
[49:02] John the greatest of all to introduce
[49:04] the head himself Christ he was not in
[49:07] the family of God as we quote
[49:12] it see then he could go to the
[49:14] Wilderness and come
[49:16] out but brother Brandon would have to be
[49:18] a
[49:19] prophet above the five-fold ministry you
[49:22] would agree right agabus was Paul was
[49:26] right he can refer to the church as
[49:28] Messengers as being
[49:30] prophets right I don't have no trouble
[49:33] with that I know we we had meetings and
[49:35] people uh he Paul ain't no
[49:39] Prophet I said well he ain't much
[49:41] Prophet to you and way it goes but you
[49:44] know he said I magnify my own
[49:47] office so if you want to call an apostle
[49:49] then he he magnified his own office what
[49:52] was he brother randam calls those
[49:53] Messengers Luther and them prophets
[49:56] that's fine that's right why because
[49:59] they were the The Messengers to the age
[50:02] the word came it doesn't matter what all
[50:04] the other things Luther
[50:08] taught but yet he taught the just shall
[50:10] live by faith that was the word for the
[50:14] hour that he was living amen
[50:17] right and that brought him to be in that
[50:20] prophetic
[50:22] realm one of those stars in the book of
[50:25] Revelation see in his hands and look how
[50:28] close the star would be to him in his
[50:30] hands you all right but do you
[50:31] understand what I'm saying
[50:33] yes then when you move up into the
[50:36] five-fold ministry remember you're
[50:38] bringing it into dealing with the body
[50:42] of Jesus Christ so brother brandham was
[50:45] a member of the body of Christ by having
[50:49] the new birth amen right all right now
[50:53] and being a member of the body of
[50:56] Christ see then he would be he could
[51:00] fulfill any of the offices
[51:05] right cuz he was above that right amen
[51:08] he was the prophet of the age that the
[51:11] word was to come to right now the word
[51:13] wasn't to come to the fivefold ministry
[51:15] listen to what I'm saying
[51:17] now you say yes it did no I'll get it
[51:20] off of you you're trying to make
[51:22] something the word comes to the prophet
[51:25] right
[51:26] it had already come to the prophet if
[51:28] you want to say it was already written
[51:30] for brother randam guy here go ahead
[51:32] that come through somebody
[51:34] right Paul is the biggest one that the
[51:38] writing of the New Testament comes
[51:39] through right John going to patmas and
[51:42] all and his writings covers up the
[51:45] biggest portion of the the New Testament
[51:48] all right but you see the prophets you
[51:51] you're you're doing we'll get to the
[51:52] next message where you build on the
[51:53] foundation Apostles and Prophets right
[51:56] all right now but stay with me on this
[52:00] of what we're thinking
[52:02] about the prophet being a born again
[52:05] believer in the body of Christ then he
[52:08] couldn't back
[52:10] up away from the
[52:13] people he said you can't do that that's
[52:15] right amen see and the reason is cuz
[52:18] he's in the body of Christ right he
[52:21] would be backing up and and going which
[52:23] that's what he would like to done
[52:26] but he couldn't do it no right see he's
[52:29] part of the body of Christ then when he
[52:30] says the bride is the fullness of the
[52:32] godhead bodily you know what he's part
[52:33] of the Bride when he says a bride will
[52:36] do this and a bride will do that you
[52:38] know what he's part of the Bride
[52:41] right you're not dealing with an Old
[52:43] Testament Prophet that's right come on
[52:45] now that's taught in the message that he
[52:47] was an Old Testament prophet in a new
[52:49] testament
[52:51] age now that's a Doctrine in the message
[52:53] people not too far from here
[52:56] okay that he was an Old Testament
[52:58] prophet in a new testament age I said
[53:01] you'd have a
[53:03] lawgiver if he's an old testament
[53:05] Prophet he'd be a lawgiver that's right
[53:08] you
[53:10] know you can't do that you can't put
[53:14] your messenger in another age that's
[53:16] where they Justified Christmas trees you
[53:18] know how they done that brother brandom
[53:20] was a prophet back there we're in
[53:22] another age so we don't put up Christmas
[53:25] trees even though the prophet put up one
[53:27] well go ahead and do what you want to
[53:29] forget
[53:30] it you are anyway but just to show up
[53:34] the smartness of what mankind thinks he
[53:37] is but listen being a member of the body
[53:40] of
[53:41] Christ put him in the position that he
[53:45] could not isolate
[53:47] himself and just run in and
[53:50] out he has to live with it cuz now here
[53:55] swallow real good okay everybody
[53:58] swallowed
[54:00] okay cuz you see when you get into the
[54:02] New Testament you're getting a little
[54:04] closer
[54:06] to God in human
[54:09] flesh than you are in the Old
[54:13] Testament I said a little closer I got a
[54:15] message on that okay it was coming just
[54:18] just buar with me you you you
[54:22] know if you listen to Masterpiece you
[54:24] know what I'm talking about Mary was not
[54:27] the
[54:28] seed she was a
[54:30] carrier all right somebody's got to be
[54:33] the seed
[54:37] okay when he says that the godhead can't
[54:39] be complete without you amen I believe
[54:41] it couldn't be complete without brother
[54:44] brandham see that's why that when he was
[54:47] speaking one day one of the brothers are
[54:49] something I forgot why it turned out but
[54:50] he said you've been given more
[54:53] gifts than any any of the other prophet
[54:55] in the things the reason was because he
[54:58] was a new testament Born Again
[55:01] believer Paul was in that position for
[55:03] his day but listen Paul was in no
[55:06] comparison and that's not Tor off on
[55:08] Paul he's in glory screaming Hallelujah
[55:11] tell them about it Paul was in no
[55:13] position to qualify for an end time
[55:17] messenger that was to be brought to
[55:19] speak about Malachi 4 right do you see
[55:23] where I give all the honor and the glory
[55:24] to to the man that brought the message
[55:26] unto us all right but then believing it
[55:28] we've got to become that
[55:30] message all right see just just stay
[55:33] with me until I get some things out of
[55:35] the way you know of preaching and then
[55:36] maybe one of these days I'll preach what
[55:37] I believe okay
[55:40] uh then you can get up and leave and say
[55:42] I don't agree with you that's all right
[55:44] but listen what about this five-fold
[55:47] ministry
[55:49] now now if you notice in Ephesians
[55:52] 4 that we read it's got some words in
[55:55] there that are very touching to me
[55:59] because it says he
[56:04] gave he
[56:07] gave now how did the prophet
[56:10] explain that the way that Jesus and God
[56:13] was
[56:16] one you remember that he said God came
[56:19] down and went in
[56:23] him he said that was the way that Jesus
[56:26] and God was one God came down and went
[56:29] in him all right see not a second person
[56:33] or third person or anything he was that
[56:36] person all right now then in thinking
[56:39] about it that he gave
[56:43] some and brother Brandon will'll use
[56:45] we'll get it in a second he said he set
[56:47] in the
[56:52] church now I've given all the honor I
[56:54] think and in my lifetime to believing
[56:56] that and showing you and trying to my
[56:58] best to show you that brother brandham
[57:00] had the
[57:02] message all right and we didn't get it
[57:06] without him the word didn't come to
[57:08] Samuel Dale nor nor better stop
[57:12] that anybody
[57:15] else the word come to the prophet then
[57:18] the word comes to the bride by way of
[57:20] the Prophet but it's got to come
[57:23] through
[57:25] the channel that he said it which is the
[57:28] fful ministry well brother D I can get
[57:30] it for myself you didn't get it for
[57:33] yourself so blab all you want
[57:35] to you never got
[57:37] it I know it for the prophet we needed
[57:40] to follow
[57:43] you all right well don't make us hard
[57:47] now why
[57:50] not get into
[57:52] silliness our total dependence is upon
[57:54] on whether God sent his Prophet or
[57:59] not our total dependence of rapture
[58:01] future whatever it depended upon whether
[58:04] or not that he would keep his word and
[58:07] bring Malachi forward into
[58:09] being and send the word to a
[58:13] man that made him just a little
[58:17] closer than an Old Testament Prophet
[58:21] right I want you to just calculate that
[58:24] a little we'll get back on
[58:26] it because the Old Testament Prophet
[58:29] didn't have the new birth in his
[58:31] soul he could only be
[58:35] anointed right but a new testament
[58:39] Prophet had the new
[58:41] birth well then you better be dealing
[58:43] with a five-fold Ministry in that realm
[58:46] because get the point the prophets of
[58:49] old brought the body Jesus Christ
[58:52] stepped up and there he was right we'll
[58:55] get to it later in another message the
[58:56] New Testament brings the body and then
[59:00] the last one to introduce that
[59:02] was the Elijah of melachi
[59:05] 4 to introduce the word which is Christ
[59:09] but somebody's got to become that word
[59:11] not just talk about it not just be a
[59:14] marry as a
[59:15] carrier we've got to be it all right but
[59:17] follow it now so let's let's just think
[59:19] a little bit Jesus Christ is the same
[59:21] yesterday today and forever
[59:23] 1958 he's talking about prophets and
[59:25] missionaries and Gifts of the church and
[59:27] all first apostles then prophets
[59:29] teachers pastors evangelists uh you know
[59:32] coming down and he gets to it he said
[59:35] Apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[59:38] teachers five spiritual
[59:42] gifts that's
[59:45] predestinated now watch so watch what he
[59:48] does he covers he gets it so perfectly
[59:51] uh I sit sometimes and I just I weep
[59:54] keep I everything else just thinking how
[59:57] perfect a man could
[59:58] talk with a seventh grade
[1:00:02] education and just how perfect a man
[1:00:05] could speak when there be no other way
[1:00:06] you could say it cuz look what he's
[1:00:08] saying you reading it five spiritual
[1:00:10] gifts that's predestinated that by for
[1:00:13] knowledge God said in the
[1:00:16] church now you got the predestinated of
[1:00:20] the word that says there will be
[1:00:21] Apostles prophets and things that's the
[1:00:26] word and then you got what by forn
[1:00:30] knowledge he brings an
[1:00:33] individual who
[1:00:35] can let that gift be within
[1:00:40] them to speak back so he sets it in
[1:00:44] there
[1:00:46] right he sets in the church God did
[1:00:50] that's exactly right gifts and callings
[1:00:52] are without repentance all those gifts
[1:00:55] are in the church I'm not a preacher
[1:00:58] look at him not much of one I'm just a
[1:01:00] SP Tire said brother Veil is the
[1:01:02] preacher now look at it he didn't have
[1:01:04] no problem with being sincere did he but
[1:01:07] look at the next one here you himym uh
[1:01:10] 1958 speak the word Lord if that would
[1:01:14] be sufficient but God's good he has set
[1:01:18] in the
[1:01:20] church
[1:01:22] gifts first apostles or missionaries
[1:01:25] both the same Apostles means one cent
[1:01:28] missionary means one cent Apostles
[1:01:30] prophets teachers evangelist pastors
[1:01:32] they're all predestinated gifts of
[1:01:36] God gifts and callings of God are
[1:01:39] without repentance they're placed in the
[1:01:41] church to bring the church together hold
[1:01:43] it together for the glory of
[1:01:46] God
[1:01:49] so this part you're looking at is for
[1:01:52] knowledge right
[1:01:56] but yet the
[1:01:57] gift that God has for the
[1:02:01] church is a
[1:02:05] predestinated word
[1:02:07] right through the
[1:02:10] gift Paul said the gift whereof I'm
[1:02:15] called
[1:02:17] right he he he knew that God was using
[1:02:22] him and he knew God was that it was God
[1:02:25] speaking through
[1:02:27] him
[1:02:29] right and he was trying to help people
[1:02:32] to
[1:02:34] see that's where people are saying today
[1:02:36] well now we're kind of like Baptist you
[1:02:38] know Baptist they'll take they'll take
[1:02:40] um pastors and they'll take missionaries
[1:02:43] which they don't understand that word
[1:02:44] Apostle missionary but they'll claim
[1:02:46] missionaries and and they will uh they
[1:02:49] will take
[1:02:50] evangelists and on a rare occasion
[1:02:53] they'll accept except a teacher you know
[1:02:55] in the form of what they're doing you
[1:02:57] didn't come through there so you you
[1:02:59] wouldn't know it but if you'll think
[1:03:00] about where you came from that was the
[1:03:01] bases there too because if if somebody
[1:03:04] come along this is Apostle so and so is
[1:03:05] going to come and speak for us
[1:03:08] tonight who do he think he is he's a
[1:03:12] missionary oh brother I forgot I should
[1:03:15] have said missionary's coming tonight
[1:03:16] speak yeah missionary's
[1:03:18] coming but see we want to try to make
[1:03:21] ourselves so super spiritual
[1:03:25] until we can correct the word of
[1:03:28] God but what I love about it here and I
[1:03:30] know I have my own definition here and
[1:03:32] some people may not agree with you may
[1:03:33] not that's all right but he said he gave
[1:03:37] some
[1:03:39] Apostles he gave some prophets he gave
[1:03:42] some teachers he gave some evangelists
[1:03:45] and
[1:03:45] pastors I've made my definition of that
[1:03:49] understanding to be made known to you
[1:03:50] for 40 something years already that I
[1:03:53] believe he gave give people what they
[1:03:55] have need
[1:03:56] of and some people
[1:03:59] need a pastor to just hold their hands
[1:04:02] and Pat them and you know you know be
[1:04:04] good to them and I'm not throwing off on
[1:04:05] it
[1:04:07] now Heaven Help me now and you you get
[1:04:10] the wrong idea of what I'm saying that's
[1:04:12] your business but see this the man
[1:04:15] that's you know he he stays
[1:04:19] simple simple is
[1:04:23] wonderful
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:27] simple but the deepest thing in the
[1:04:29] world once it's revealed is
[1:04:31] simple now where are we going to take
[1:04:33] one and make him greater than the
[1:04:35] other no they're all in the body of
[1:04:38] Christ it doesn't
[1:04:40] matter but you know what I'm saying
[1:04:42] there's there's pastors that just stay
[1:04:45] simple with their people but you know
[1:04:47] now Pastor is not going to reject an
[1:04:49] apostle that brings a word to him now
[1:04:51] you tell me that and you're in bad shape
[1:04:53] so all right but you see then there's
[1:04:58] Apostles and there's teachers and things
[1:05:00] like that and I'm not the one that put
[1:05:02] it our brother Brown said that nobody
[1:05:03] can touch the teacher even though he's
[1:05:05] not above the Apostle neither is he
[1:05:08] above the
[1:05:10] pastor it's just the gift
[1:05:13] right it's what God has given right amen
[1:05:17] and he gives us what we have need of
[1:05:20] thank you Lorden you know I mean you go
[1:05:23] you listen to others and you you come
[1:05:24] back and you tell him me said well
[1:05:26] brother Dale they're wonderful I really
[1:05:28] enjoyed the brother but I wouldn't want
[1:05:29] to have to listen to that all the time
[1:05:31] that's not
[1:05:32] derogatory that means you have a
[1:05:35] different form of appetite or whatever
[1:05:37] you want to call it you know your
[1:05:39] digestive system is in a different form
[1:05:42] to where that you can uh eat a little
[1:05:46] meat where some people cannot eat very
[1:05:49] much meat well I'm not throwing off of I
[1:05:51] love beans and ters right I mean there's
[1:05:54] nothing I love any more than green beans
[1:05:57] I'm a professional on green
[1:05:59] beans my wife we go to a cafe especially
[1:06:03] some of these sideline things you know
[1:06:05] and I get green beans she said you want
[1:06:08] them green beans yeah I love green
[1:06:11] beans ask these nurses and things about
[1:06:14] it they studied it enough those greens
[1:06:16] are poisonous you need them in your
[1:06:18] system cuz that's fighting off things
[1:06:21] the greens you need the greens you need
[1:06:23] to eat the greens
[1:06:25] but you say but I don't want them I love
[1:06:26] steak well that's
[1:06:29] good but you can die eat and steak you
[1:06:31] need a
[1:06:33] balance all right we need a balance of
[1:06:35] the five-fold ministry that's why I call
[1:06:37] in people to get them to preach for
[1:06:39] us you know and I've told you as honest
[1:06:42] as I can tell you if I could find a true
[1:06:44] Prophet that would really just sit down
[1:06:46] and go from one to the other I would get
[1:06:49] him in here and announce about a month
[1:06:51] early you better not come cuz he going
[1:06:54] to start with me and then he's going to
[1:06:55] take in each
[1:06:59] individual and we'll see who will lay
[1:07:02] out I would be glad to do it amen I
[1:07:06] believe in a five-fold Ministry I don't
[1:07:08] believe in a onefold Ministry I don't
[1:07:10] believe in brother Dale having it all
[1:07:11] I've never taught nothing like
[1:07:14] that my dependence asked me the other
[1:07:16] night in a Bible study said brother Dale
[1:07:19] said who do you pay your tie
[1:07:22] to I pay my ti of the five full
[1:07:28] ministry I've got to pay tith you said
[1:07:30] would the preacher pay tith he ought to
[1:07:31] be the first one the prophet said it
[1:07:33] would right amen well my tithe and way
[1:07:37] we handle things here is different than
[1:07:39] all other churches anyway that ain't
[1:07:40] none of their
[1:07:42] business
[1:07:43] but I have you know I have to pay tithe
[1:07:47] well then I can take that tithe of
[1:07:48] whatever I make that year and take 10%
[1:07:51] of it and I can call in Preachers and
[1:07:53] let them come in preach to you and don't
[1:07:55] even have to off pull an offering from
[1:08:00] you I let my ti pay these ministers that
[1:08:03] come through amen he said well sometimes
[1:08:06] you pay that and too much that ain't got
[1:08:09] nothing to do with
[1:08:11] it that's
[1:08:14] you I ain't going to get much message
[1:08:16] done this evening
[1:08:18] either but he gave what you have need of
[1:08:21] that's
[1:08:22] right said there are people that just
[1:08:25] they just love the simple and the Jesus
[1:08:28] Christ but now here's my definition
[1:08:30] again I believe if Pastor should be able
[1:08:33] to
[1:08:34] teach what in the capacity of a pastor
[1:08:38] he's not to teach in the capacity of a
[1:08:40] teacher that's he's not to he he can
[1:08:43] work and he can uh see things which
[1:08:47] would be the prophet but yet he's not
[1:08:49] trying to take the prophet's place but
[1:08:50] he sees it in his capacity he can see
[1:08:53] the Apostle to set her in order of the
[1:08:55] different thing but he does it in his
[1:08:58] capacity that way then I don't look down
[1:09:00] and say no no that's we don't need that
[1:09:03] no no we need it right
[1:09:05] amen I believe every Ministry should be
[1:09:08] able to do as exactly what I said the
[1:09:11] Evangelist should be able to teach in
[1:09:13] the capacity of an evangelist that's
[1:09:16] what one brother got on to me one time
[1:09:17] about said all y'all do is let these
[1:09:19] pastors come in and teach said preach to
[1:09:22] the people said you Lord let some us
[1:09:24] evangelist in I said when you evangelist
[1:09:26] get where you preach as good as some of
[1:09:27] these pastors I'll be glad to call
[1:09:31] you and I didn't
[1:09:33] smile cuz I'm meant
[1:09:36] it and I called a brother's name I said
[1:09:38] when you get where you can preach like
[1:09:40] him I'd be glad for you to come and
[1:09:44] preach now I agree because I explained
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:47] too you ain't going to have it in the
[1:09:50] body of Christ because they're just not
[1:09:52] going to get together too much much
[1:09:53] separation that's right I proved in a
[1:09:56] Minister's meeting one time that you
[1:09:58] could take the tithe from the pastor
[1:10:00] evangelist
[1:10:03] teachers and the tithe from that would
[1:10:06] run the five-fold ministry and you would
[1:10:09] never have to take an offering for no
[1:10:11] five-fold Ministry person I proved that
[1:10:14] in the minist meeting you think anybody
[1:10:16] wanted to deal on that you got a whole
[1:10:18] lot more pastors who they paying their
[1:10:19] tithe
[1:10:21] to come on
[1:10:24] they could pay it to the
[1:10:26] Evangelist there's not as many
[1:10:28] evangelists they are pastors right
[1:10:30] there's not as many teachers they are
[1:10:31] evangelist so then the teach the
[1:10:33] Evangelist could be paying the
[1:10:37] teachers right right and God's whole
[1:10:40] work would run off of what comes through
[1:10:41] the man that's a pastor of the church
[1:10:43] but you know what no the pastor of the
[1:10:44] church he's he's got them holler Pockets
[1:10:48] you
[1:10:48] know all the tide goes to the
[1:10:52] pastor and he he's out scrb all over the
[1:10:55] country you know as an
[1:10:58] evangelist well you can't say that about
[1:11:00] me so that's all
[1:11:03] right but listen
[1:11:05] Church gifts I didn't mean to get in all
[1:11:11] that because this is this is one of my
[1:11:14] pet peeves I
[1:11:16] guess is the way people do and the way
[1:11:19] they talk about a 5f
[1:11:22] Ministry now we've got the prophet's
[1:11:24] messag
[1:11:26] amen we had a meeting years ago about
[1:11:28] something and the brother said well
[1:11:30] brother bram's not here now to
[1:11:32] straighten this out I
[1:11:34] said got the books and the
[1:11:39] tapes brother Brandon what is the
[1:11:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ a
[1:11:42] Myster of God reveal the baptism of the
[1:11:44] Holy Ghost is a new
[1:11:46] birth it's Christ in
[1:11:49] you that's settled we see what he was
[1:11:53] saying he wasn't going to listen to
[1:11:55] nobody right so then that's you know
[1:11:59] puts a lot of quetes to a lot of things
[1:12:02] but
[1:12:03] look when he gets down to the message as
[1:12:05] the eagle stir their nest
[1:12:07] 1959 he
[1:12:10] says and God is good he sends his word
[1:12:13] now
[1:12:15] watch now you read what he's
[1:12:17] saying he sends his word we've had to
[1:12:22] profit right right right amen we've had
[1:12:25] the
[1:12:26] prophet he s his word come on you
[1:12:30] reading God is good he sends his
[1:12:35] word he sent us the prophet right now
[1:12:38] watch what he said if you won't believe
[1:12:41] his
[1:12:47] word then he puts in the church five
[1:12:51] different
[1:12:52] offices that's
[1:12:55] good first apostles prophets teach that
[1:12:58] they are for the perfecting of the
[1:13:02] church then he explains everything and
[1:13:05] in each local body he put nine spiritual
[1:13:07] gifts in the local
[1:13:09] body that's gifts that goes from one to
[1:13:12] the other
[1:13:16] right you can stand up prophesy and
[1:13:18] never speak again right you can speak in
[1:13:21] tongues and never speak again right
[1:13:23] that's
[1:13:25] right come on that's right but these are
[1:13:29] ordained and predestinated of God gifts
[1:13:33] and callings are without repentance you
[1:13:35] know that here they are and God set them
[1:13:38] in the
[1:13:39] church
[1:13:42] now we've had the prophet's
[1:13:46] message but the people's not going to
[1:13:49] depend on the five-fold ministry to do
[1:13:51] what the Bible said and the prophet just
[1:13:54] said because in Ephesians it said to 54
[1:13:57] Ministry is for the perfecting of the
[1:13:58] Saints I just get it from brother
[1:14:01] brandham I ain't listen to nobody
[1:14:04] else go
[1:14:07] ahead that's your business it's not
[1:14:09] mine I don't need you
[1:14:13] here we're getting so many babies now
[1:14:15] we're going to have to start making that
[1:14:16] wall out that
[1:14:19] way but the one thing about it we
[1:14:21] getting we getting a lot of girls
[1:14:24] you know what that means we're going to
[1:14:25] get a lot of
[1:14:27] boys church is going to be increasing we
[1:14:29] all may be dead before it is here but
[1:14:31] you all right wake you up and get you
[1:14:37] listening the prophet says it the Bible
[1:14:39] says it that the five-fold ministry is
[1:14:42] for the perfecting of the
[1:14:43] Saints
[1:14:45] now but I just take what the prophet
[1:14:50] says well that's wonderful
[1:14:54] yeah the prophet just said the five four
[1:14:57] ministers for the perfecting of the sign
[1:14:58] you
[1:15:00] just you you ate your own
[1:15:02] shoe you opened your big mouth and got
[1:15:05] it in best thing do is either swallow it
[1:15:08] or spit it out because you just
[1:15:10] condemned your own
[1:15:14] self but you see then we come along and
[1:15:16] we you know you think we're trying to be
[1:15:18] this now if I was like a lot of these
[1:15:21] ministers I wouldn't be arguing with you
[1:15:23] one
[1:15:25] whatsoever there's a lot of these
[1:15:27] churches I wouldn't go to because not
[1:15:29] only is a pastor he might be preaching
[1:15:31] some pretty good but what are they doing
[1:15:35] like some of
[1:15:37] them they're gone half the time out on
[1:15:39] the field is
[1:15:43] evangelist
[1:15:49] right but you see if we believe the
[1:15:52] prophet let's do what the Prophet saids
[1:15:54] right that's he said you honor the gift
[1:15:56] God will honor you that's why people
[1:15:59] don't get
[1:16:01] anything and I don't mean nothing I
[1:16:03] don't mean you don't get
[1:16:04] nothing I just mean even here in
[1:16:07] Lula if we put our dependence upon the
[1:16:10] gift not the person not this
[1:16:14] one if I have anything to say to you
[1:16:16] it's going to be one thing I've been
[1:16:18] here 40 something years and you've got a
[1:16:21] right to stand up and say as that guy
[1:16:23] ever tried to make anything out of
[1:16:27] itself when I even a lot of times won't
[1:16:29] even tell you what God shows me of
[1:16:31] personal things or something why because
[1:16:35] I don't want you built on some form of
[1:16:37] that I want you built on whether the
[1:16:39] word is right or
[1:16:42] not come and show me where I've Twisted
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:47] word I wasn't the one that said the
[1:16:49] five4 ministers for the perfecting of
[1:16:51] the
[1:16:52] Saints
[1:16:55] the prophet said it and he said he gave
[1:16:57] us his word but if you won't take his
[1:17:00] word
[1:17:04] yeah but pay your T TI to a tape
[1:17:07] recorder yeah come on I'm
[1:17:12] serious no joke
[1:17:18] serious let me ask you one serious
[1:17:22] question
[1:17:24] as I said I can take and type in what I
[1:17:27] want to and pull it up on that screen
[1:17:29] and call it paragraph uh e14 of Jehovah
[1:17:34] Gyra and say anything I want
[1:17:36] to I didn't know they was going to do
[1:17:38] that one
[1:17:40] up but you know what I
[1:17:45] mean how do you
[1:17:48] know the tapes and the books and
[1:17:51] the deal you have any from anywhere and
[1:17:55] I'm not throwing no slangs I thoroughly
[1:17:58] appreciate all of the work that the
[1:18:01] voice of God Recordings has done around
[1:18:04] the world I am behind that 100% of their
[1:18:09] works of what they're trying to do in
[1:18:10] helping people tried to help and try to
[1:18:13] do
[1:18:15] myself but what if you what if they type
[1:18:18] something in there that brother brandham
[1:18:19] didn't
[1:18:21] say well they check it so and so so well
[1:18:24] what if so and so agrees with so and so
[1:18:26] do so and so and agrees with so and
[1:18:29] so I preached the message one time and I
[1:18:31] know you've heard it you're going to
[1:18:33] hear it again I preached a message on a
[1:18:36] little Plan called
[1:18:39] Capa this in the questions and answers
[1:18:41] on conduct order and Doctrine
[1:18:44] 64 and I I preached it as a spirital
[1:18:47] dome resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[1:18:48] places in Christ Jesus you know and like
[1:18:51] a dome on a uh Weather Vein on on the
[1:18:53] building and all the
[1:18:55] definitions and I went home and I was
[1:18:57] sitting there thinking I thought well
[1:18:58] Lord that was a pretty good thought you
[1:19:01] know I enjoyed preaching on that and
[1:19:03] something just said that's all right but
[1:19:04] it's not what I was talking
[1:19:09] about I knew the man personally that had
[1:19:11] tyed
[1:19:12] it brother
[1:19:14] Buckley I knew him knew him personally
[1:19:18] knew for years and all he done that
[1:19:19] that's what he took it off the taste and
[1:19:20] put it in topes and
[1:19:23] and I knew he had for 12 or 14 years
[1:19:25] college and if anybody had a right to
[1:19:27] know what words meant it's a whole lot
[1:19:28] better for him it was
[1:19:30] me
[1:19:32] but still there was something
[1:19:35] wrong and I said Lord what can I do I
[1:19:38] don't have no
[1:19:42] education I know how to go to a
[1:19:43] dictionary and look up the
[1:19:45] word but if if you're telling me
[1:19:48] something's wrong here how can I go to a
[1:19:51] dictionary
[1:19:54] we had the old real to real right I got
[1:19:57] that I said well the best thing I can do
[1:19:59] is at least look up listen to The
[1:20:01] Prophet So I listened to it and when he
[1:20:05] come across there he said it very and
[1:20:08] you could call him northerner if you
[1:20:09] wanted to and he said he doesn't say
[1:20:13] Capa he says
[1:20:21] capula Lord
[1:20:24] maybe maybe you use this old dummy now
[1:20:27] to find out something what does that
[1:20:31] mean I looked up the
[1:20:34] definition of Capa in the dictionary you
[1:20:38] know how they Puck P
[1:20:40] love and I said that don't fit the way
[1:20:42] he's saying
[1:20:45] it so I ran the tape and run it and
[1:20:47] listen went through the dictionaries
[1:20:49] went
[1:20:51] through I a while it's like something
[1:20:53] said change your
[1:20:58] wording from
[1:21:02] Capa I took it from
[1:21:06] copula and went back and got the word
[1:21:10] copulation and then now you go read the
[1:21:13] book or listen to the tape and see what
[1:21:15] brother Brown was talking about he's
[1:21:16] talking about the head and body
[1:21:18] uniting that is
[1:21:21] copulation CAPA is a Weather Vein over a
[1:21:25] church I come back here that night
[1:21:28] shout it wasn't a correction of brother
[1:21:32] brandom it was the correction of the
[1:21:35] ones who tyed it
[1:21:37] up and I mentioned that to the brother
[1:21:39] later and he said well you know you
[1:21:41] could be
[1:21:43] right we see the before and the after
[1:21:45] explained it he would talking about
[1:21:47] sexual
[1:21:48] intercourse between the head and the
[1:21:51] body of Christ
[1:21:54] and that's
[1:21:55] copulation now you understand what I
[1:21:57] mean yes sir sincerity of people can
[1:22:02] still take it you take brother browner's
[1:22:04] message go home and do it I wouldn't try
[1:22:07] in no way to interpret what he's trying
[1:22:09] to say but with the least education have
[1:22:12] a ninth grade education and come to find
[1:22:14] out you try to punctuate what he's
[1:22:17] saying you try to read it by their
[1:22:19] punctuation period means stop pause
[1:22:22] think on that and they got a
[1:22:28] comma do you understand what I'm trying
[1:22:30] to say without it
[1:22:32] being something that you think I'm
[1:22:34] trying to make something out of
[1:22:35] something I am I'm trying to make it out
[1:22:36] of
[1:22:37] God
[1:22:40] right this church has not been built on
[1:22:43] some man or some idea it's been built on
[1:22:44] God's word that's right as long as I'm
[1:22:47] here it'll stay that
[1:22:48] way you want to change something else
[1:22:50] you're going to get rid of me first
[1:22:54] why because I know one thing for sure
[1:22:57] we've had the word right we brought
[1:22:59] God's brought the word to you and I I'm
[1:23:00] not looking for somebody to come along
[1:23:02] and interpret that I'm looking for the
[1:23:04] Holy Spirit to come into you and I and
[1:23:07] make it
[1:23:10] live needs to be lived instead of
[1:23:12] interpreted we've got the perfect the
[1:23:15] prophet said interpretation with Divine
[1:23:17] Vindication he said right and then he
[1:23:19] turns around he says Masterpiece if you
[1:23:21] listen to that message
[1:23:23] he said it's or either see not there
[1:23:24] with a shook he said it's up to bride to
[1:23:26] vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[1:23:29] Revelation 10:7 did you remember that
[1:23:31] out of the message it's up to the bride
[1:23:33] to do
[1:23:34] it what it's up to you and I to be the
[1:23:37] word made
[1:23:38] flesh all
[1:23:43] right let's go get off of that
[1:23:47] now one scripture that's always bothered
[1:23:51] me
[1:23:53] you know CU I know what it's saying but
[1:23:56] Paul says to seek the most Earnest
[1:24:03] gift you remember
[1:24:06] that now what does that
[1:24:16] mean am I a pastor and I'm wanting to be
[1:24:19] a teacher so I seek the most Earnest
[1:24:22] gift you know which would mean the
[1:24:24] greater gift right you know going
[1:24:28] on or would I want to be a prophet and
[1:24:31] Apostle you
[1:24:33] know is that what he talking about seek
[1:24:37] the most Earnest gift but look at this
[1:24:39] one the one that we just had there uh
[1:24:42] Jehovah Gyra
[1:24:43] e461 to2 212 the morning look what he
[1:24:48] said now then gifts where Paul said I
[1:24:51] pray earnest estly for the best gift
[1:24:54] that's Church
[1:24:58] gifts that's not
[1:25:02] offices come on you're
[1:25:06] reading there's a
[1:25:08] gift and there's an
[1:25:10] office it's an office that's a
[1:25:14] prophet all right so you remember what
[1:25:16] ago when I said a prophet's an
[1:25:19] office five four minist is an office
[1:25:26] seek the most Earnest gift is the gifts
[1:25:28] in the church
[1:25:31] right you
[1:25:34] know and that's not meaning that you try
[1:25:36] to take each other's
[1:25:38] place cuz that wouldn't be the right
[1:25:40] Spirit
[1:25:42] right it would just mean study to show
[1:25:45] yourself approved a Workman that needeth
[1:25:48] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[1:25:50] word of truth and not just be satisfied
[1:25:52] with being a little baby that stays here
[1:25:54] and just casually along with this gift
[1:25:56] of of love and understanding and
[1:25:59] sweetness I heard brother Bram saying
[1:26:01] one day and something really stirred me
[1:26:04] because I didn't understand he said I'd
[1:26:06] rather see love in a church than 5,000
[1:26:09] people be saved or maybe he might have
[1:26:11] used
[1:26:14] 10,000 oh Lord 10,000 Souls come saved
[1:26:18] or 5,000 Souls saved comparing it to
[1:26:20] love he said because if you get love in
[1:26:22] a church he said there' be a whole lot
[1:26:24] more than that saved right I thought oh
[1:26:27] God how perfect that man's
[1:26:29] language there's a lot of difference
[1:26:31] between a prophet are you reading it
[1:26:33] that's right there's a lot of difference
[1:26:35] between a prophet and a gift of
[1:26:38] Prophecy Before a gift of Prophecy
[1:26:41] really should be given in the church it
[1:26:43] has to come before two or three judges
[1:26:45] that's got the the gift of discernment
[1:26:47] to say whether it can be said but never
[1:26:50] did you see anybody stand before Isaiah
[1:26:53] to judge
[1:26:56] it prophets are not
[1:26:59] judged the only judgment you have is
[1:27:02] whether or not he tells you the
[1:27:04] truth but if he tells you the truth and
[1:27:06] you can't argue with that then you can't
[1:27:08] judge
[1:27:13] him let's make a bad scenario out of it
[1:27:16] that's big old word some of you use you
[1:27:20] know Elisha
[1:27:22] curse them
[1:27:26] children and the sheirs come out and
[1:27:28] kill 42 of
[1:27:30] them we know that that was not God that
[1:27:33] was the gift of the Prophet abbility but
[1:27:35] you think about it where would that fit
[1:27:38] in a new testament
[1:27:40] form so how could you bring an Old
[1:27:42] Testament Prophet to a New
[1:27:46] Testament you can't do
[1:27:51] that but see where would it be the Holy
[1:27:53] Spirit would ever be like Elisha was
[1:27:55] when he said
[1:27:56] that it can't be done but you know what
[1:28:01] nobody could judge that
[1:28:10] Prophet am I right right you couldn't
[1:28:13] judge him he stands before God and God
[1:28:16] alone right now he goes on down to there
[1:28:18] in that same
[1:28:20] message and he's talking about that a
[1:28:22] person comes to him and they walked up
[1:28:24] and they said brother
[1:28:28] brandom um let's see no it's in the next
[1:28:32] message expectation excuse me all
[1:28:38] right I'm about to get on the right
[1:28:41] one this is E6 E15 e16 all right coming
[1:28:46] down so watch what it gets down said not
[1:28:49] long ago a person walked up to me and
[1:28:51] said
[1:28:52] is thus sayith the Lord the Lord said do
[1:28:55] this if you don't go do it to a certain
[1:28:59] place or a certain thing and do a
[1:29:02] certain thing the Lord's going to strike
[1:29:04] you and take your gift away from
[1:29:11] you now he said thus sayith the Lord you
[1:29:15] remember them arguing there in the
[1:29:17] scriptures and the prophets
[1:29:19] said you going down there you going our
[1:29:22] 70
[1:29:23] years man walks up it's thus sayith the
[1:29:27] Lord you be down our two years that
[1:29:29] always made silly to me
[1:29:32] anyway I'm not explain silly I know it
[1:29:36] but here Jeremiah was saying 70
[1:29:38] years and this man he didn't say
[1:29:41] Jeremiah you're wrong we're not going
[1:29:43] into captivity that's what it sound like
[1:29:44] he ought have
[1:29:46] said no he took part of the
[1:29:50] anointing from Jeremiah's statement and
[1:29:53] said we're going to be down there two
[1:29:55] years that's thus sayith the Lord now it
[1:29:58] was thus sayith that
[1:30:00] guy because it was down there 70 years
[1:30:03] all right you know what happened to
[1:30:05] it so then what does he
[1:30:10] say so the man told him as do say he
[1:30:12] said that isn't
[1:30:14] true now that isn't true that isn't true
[1:30:17] GS and calling without repentance
[1:30:19] there's a spirit that's in the
[1:30:20] church there are spirits that's in the
[1:30:24] church that's true such as gift of
[1:30:26] Prophecy healings and so forth but
[1:30:28] they're in the entire body it may fall
[1:30:30] upon one person tonight A Prophecy and
[1:30:33] it might not never fall on that person
[1:30:36] again it might be somewhere else in the
[1:30:39] body and those Spirits are supposed to
[1:30:41] be judged let one speak into judgment
[1:30:44] now those are the spirits of the gifts
[1:30:48] that's in the
[1:30:49] church but the only person that has a
[1:30:51] right to say thus sayith the Lord is a
[1:30:53] Vindicated
[1:30:55] Prophet why because thus sayith the Lord
[1:30:57] can't be
[1:30:59] judged now I get don't say thus sayith
[1:31:02] the
[1:31:03] Lord that's what he just said to man
[1:31:05] told him is thus sayith the Lord or
[1:31:07] somebody did I get up and say that then
[1:31:09] it can be it's it's judged because it
[1:31:11] don't happen right but are you following
[1:31:14] me come on as Spirits they're in the
[1:31:18] entire
[1:31:20] body you're born with gifts trying to
[1:31:23] scan and pick
[1:31:27] up agabus was a
[1:31:30] prophet not a man with a gift of
[1:31:32] Prophecy I'm reading from demonology
[1:31:36] religious
[1:31:37] R the gift of healing and all those
[1:31:41] gifts my Pentecostal friend you got it
[1:31:44] mixed up the gifts are in the church
[1:31:47] subject to any persons in the church
[1:31:50] anybody's baptized into the body Body by
[1:31:52] one spirit with all but the gifts and
[1:31:54] callings of God are without repentance
[1:31:56] they don't heal
[1:31:58] you coming on down to the
[1:32:01] message end time ministry I think what
[1:32:03] it
[1:32:05] is gifts don't heal
[1:32:09] you all
[1:32:10] right so there's
[1:32:15] offices and there's
[1:32:17] gifts the nine spiritual gifts has to be
[1:32:20] judged
[1:32:25] okay Prophet don't have to be
[1:32:29] judged now what about a five-fold
[1:32:35] Ministry who's going to judge
[1:32:41] him now come on I ain't got it out of
[1:32:43] line and you know I ain't got it out of
[1:32:45] line because it's what I just
[1:32:48] said if a prophet prophesies a lie you
[1:32:51] don't you don't have to judge him he
[1:32:52] judged his own
[1:32:54] self if he speaks presumptuously he's
[1:32:57] judged his own self he doomed his own
[1:32:59] self the man that said he'll be down
[1:33:01] there two years he was killed or in
[1:33:04] prison died yeah he died that
[1:33:07] year why because he was off the word
[1:33:12] right so then the five-fold
[1:33:14] ministry is given to the body of
[1:33:19] Christ to break down we read there the
[1:33:22] other day from the prophet what did he
[1:33:23] say these young ministers take this
[1:33:25] message and sweep it on to the coming of
[1:33:27] the
[1:33:28] Lord right right a five-fold Ministry
[1:33:32] sweep the message
[1:33:34] on are you coming here just because you
[1:33:37] got to have a place to pay
[1:33:39] tithe you
[1:33:42] know but then what does the ministers do
[1:33:44] with a tithe that comes in that's what I
[1:33:46] said while ago there a lot of them I
[1:33:47] wouldn't listen
[1:33:50] to I've got brother brandham where he
[1:33:53] says TI belongs to the
[1:33:59] pastor sorry I can read
[1:34:03] too brother randam got $100 a
[1:34:11] week did all the ti go to brother
[1:34:16] brandom they went in a fund that was
[1:34:18] used
[1:34:20] yes right a fund that was used to car
[1:34:25] the
[1:34:26] gospel is what the people's money went
[1:34:30] into but he got $100 a
[1:34:36] week now when brother brandham died
[1:34:38] there probably was no money in his bank
[1:34:40] account because I don't even know where
[1:34:41] he had one or not it was some money in
[1:34:44] the the old days who called a spoken
[1:34:48] word and that developed over years until
[1:34:50] they bought where they're at and Etc the
[1:34:53] voice of God Recordings
[1:34:55] but where did Brother random ever get
[1:34:59] rich where did he take all the tithe in
[1:35:02] his own
[1:35:05] pocket and yet you see congregations
[1:35:07] where the pastors driving brand new
[1:35:10] cars
[1:35:12] right and the congregation is if you
[1:35:15] want that cuz it's been said you know if
[1:35:18] you want somebody to come in and preach
[1:35:19] for you then you you take up the
[1:35:23] money right that's none of my business
[1:35:26] because it's the word of
[1:35:28] God the ti belongs to me the pastor
[1:35:31] right but then what do I do with
[1:35:35] it
[1:35:39] right this little church along I told
[1:35:42] you the other day according to the
[1:35:43] record I think there $28,000 the
[1:35:45] missionaries last
[1:35:47] year out of a handful of people
[1:35:52] well see I don't take all of
[1:35:56] it well brother Dale you got a brand new
[1:35:58] car now we're paying
[1:36:00] forart you want to stop anytime you want
[1:36:02] to I'll make the payments on it I ain't
[1:36:03] got no problem don't have a
[1:36:06] bit cuz I that's nothing to me cuz I
[1:36:10] ain't sitting in a multi-million dollar
[1:36:12] home with all kind of
[1:36:15] things I'm getting what I need but I
[1:36:18] could be a millionaire if I took the
[1:36:20] tithe and put it in a bank account for
[1:36:26] me see what I'm saying is God gave me
[1:36:29] the
[1:36:30] gift I can use my gift to sell ice cream
[1:36:34] to an
[1:36:35] Eskimo or I can use my gift to send
[1:36:38] somebody to preach to the
[1:36:42] Eskimo
[1:36:44] right all coming from my
[1:36:49] gift there's gifts in the body nine
[1:36:51] spiritual gifts that it can be on one
[1:36:53] person a day next person the next day
[1:36:55] and the next person the next day same
[1:36:57] prophecy style but that's not true with
[1:36:59] a fivefold
[1:37:04] Ministry but see we put our whole
[1:37:06] dependence upon
[1:37:10] that well brother d i put about 90% on
[1:37:12] you well then you need to go somewhere
[1:37:14] else to find where you can put to 100%
[1:37:17] because you're going to be responsible
[1:37:18] for what you do
[1:37:19] right right I'm responsible for what I
[1:37:26] do it don't matter to me what everybody
[1:37:28] else does I'm going to do what I'm going
[1:37:30] to do my wife will tell you that she
[1:37:32] says you're just plain stubborn I'll
[1:37:34] agree I'm going to do what I'm going to
[1:37:36] do and you try to my you try to change
[1:37:38] me from that if you manipulate you can
[1:37:40] get me to move with you a little bit but
[1:37:41] if you come up and tell me you want me
[1:37:43] to change I ain't going to change I'm
[1:37:44] stubborn she's shaking her head yes put
[1:37:47] the perimet on her let her head's going
[1:37:49] that's
[1:37:50] right
[1:37:52] people thinks my wife runs me around
[1:37:53] runs my money I know what's going
[1:37:56] on I know we don't get no bills but I
[1:38:00] don't worry about
[1:38:03] it but you see when it comes to this
[1:38:07] word I've got one I answer
[1:38:11] to I answer to God
[1:38:14] himself so you show me where I've ever
[1:38:17] took brother R's message and twisted it
[1:38:19] tried to make it look like something
[1:38:20] good to help me me or to make me
[1:38:25] something the fivefold ministry is to
[1:38:28] take this message and break it down to
[1:38:29] the
[1:38:30] people that's
[1:38:32] right
[1:38:34] right hey folks I still don't mind
[1:38:37] double quoting it three times quo a lot
[1:38:39] of these preachers I wouldn't fool
[1:38:40] sitting around listening to them
[1:38:44] am but they call themselves pastors and
[1:38:50] preachers
[1:38:54] right but to me there's one way to tell
[1:38:57] where a man's a preacher or
[1:38:59] not not how fast he preaches or how much
[1:39:01] he shouts or what he does what this not
[1:39:03] even how that he gives it away or not
[1:39:05] even how that he tries to help people or
[1:39:08] tries to do everything all that can be
[1:39:10] under the kind o
[1:39:13] priest but what does he do with a
[1:39:20] word
[1:39:21] the way he preaches proves what he
[1:39:26] is You Preach ER I heard of a man here
[1:39:28] while back said he was a messenger of
[1:39:31] the church and he could preach anything
[1:39:32] he wanted to always thought you could
[1:39:34] preach anything he wanted to I
[1:39:37] mean if I want to preach era you know
[1:39:39] what brother brandham even said brother
[1:39:42] brandham said if the brandham Tabernacle
[1:39:44] now if I misquote this you get it right
[1:39:46] he said he said if they vote for brother
[1:39:49] Neville to preach Jehovah Witness
[1:39:51] Doctrine he said that's the leading of
[1:39:53] the
[1:39:55] Lord that's what he said he didn't say
[1:39:58] God made it that way he said that's the
[1:40:00] leading and he said I don't have a right
[1:40:02] to say
[1:40:07] anything but I like that quote your
[1:40:10] pastor's ordained to lead you through
[1:40:12] it's not in there in them words it's my
[1:40:15] statement goes the end of if he's
[1:40:19] ordained cuz he's really referring to
[1:40:22] brother Neville and speaking back toward
[1:40:25] about brother Neville and said that's on
[1:40:26] Christ Myster God revealed in the little
[1:40:28] section of where it's the black letter
[1:40:30] of the word to the church kind
[1:40:33] of but you see if he stays with the
[1:40:37] truth then we honor the
[1:40:41] donkey right we honor the donkey and we
[1:40:46] say thank you Lord for using the donkey
[1:40:48] amen that's right bring us the word
[1:40:51] let's stand come on musicians I hope you
[1:40:54] understand yes because I believe the
[1:40:57] five-fold ministry the gift that I have
[1:41:00] is predestinated eternally from God I
[1:41:04] said it the way I meant it I meant it
[1:41:06] the way I said it the gift that I have
[1:41:08] within
[1:41:08] me if it is the gift of God it's
[1:41:11] predestinated eternally from God the
[1:41:14] person out here I've got a lot of
[1:41:15] problems with
[1:41:17] him I'm a human element that's got a lot
[1:41:19] of problems
[1:41:23] right see that way then you just look
[1:41:26] over the problems and you listen to the
[1:41:29] word but now I'm not dumb stupid may be
[1:41:34] a little it but not
[1:41:36] dumb I'm not going to sit down and
[1:41:38] listen to No preacher that's a
[1:41:40] polygamist that's a whatever you want to
[1:41:43] call him and he's out here running in
[1:41:44] all of this stuff and the junks and
[1:41:45] doing the things of the world and then
[1:41:47] me sat down there and play my but he's
[1:41:48] my pastor he's ordained to leave me me
[1:41:50] through he's going to do it he's going
[1:41:51] to lead you through he's going to lead
[1:41:52] you right through
[1:41:55] hell that's exactly where he's going to
[1:41:56] lead you to so then what do you do do as
[1:41:59] the prophet said pastor don't stay with
[1:42:01] a word what do you
[1:42:03] do you leave the pastor yeah but I'm the
[1:42:07] pastor of Lula Georgia I am the leader
[1:42:09] of all of
[1:42:13] Lula one guy used to say he is Pastor
[1:42:16] George I think but I'm not quite that
[1:42:19] way
[1:42:22] I hope you
[1:42:23] understand I give all the honor and
[1:42:26] glory to almighty
[1:42:28] God cuz there's anything that I've ever
[1:42:30] preached he gave it to
[1:42:34] me I didn't study it and GRE Alman and
[1:42:36] my wife will tell you I don't sit at
