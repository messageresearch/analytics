[5:00] me I'm not gonna preach on
[5:04] air-conditioners tonight praise the Lord
[5:09] although I got experience at it it's
[5:15] lady I know she said she told me well to
[5:17] preach on being thankful because I tell
[5:20] you what if you're out in the heat for a
[5:21] while you're thankful for
[5:22] air-conditioning thank the Lord for
[5:26] people they know how to pick some too so
[5:32] amen praise the Lord god bless you
[5:35] tonight so we're gonna look in two
[5:38] places not look in the Book of Luke
[5:41] chapter 10 and then we're gonna go to
[5:43] Matthew chapter 9 and read few
[5:48] scriptures here and before we go to the
[5:52] Lord donut had to write myself a note
[5:54] here so have some praise and I told the
[5:59] brothers Monday night at their at the
[6:02] campsite I got two guys two boys that
[6:07] I've had my Bible for I don't know five
[6:11] or six years I guess and one boys named
[6:15] Sammy and the other one's name is Joseph
[6:16] and both I'm suffers from seizures and
[6:21] Joseph is about 14 years old and he's
[6:24] been taking medicine for about five or
[6:26] six years and they done a test this
[6:29] month and he's clear and they're gonna
[6:32] start winning off his season
[6:37] some of y'all may remember or not his
[6:40] mom was on the way to church someone's
[6:42] Sunday morning and he was eating like a
[6:45] pop-tart or something he's in the
[6:46] backseat he was like eight or nine
[6:47] whatever years it was but he they
[6:51] thought he had Bell's palsy he he got to
[6:53] the point he couldn't blink and he
[6:54] couldn't move his mouth he just went all
[6:57] froze up and they thought he had Bell's
[7:00] palsy or something he just panicked and
[7:02] she did too then she stopped the car and
[7:04] got him out and she prayed for him as
[7:06] soon as she finished praying for him it
[7:07] went away but ever since you know since
[7:10] that time he kept getting worse and
[7:12] worse than having having these spells
[7:15] but I want to thank God that he's free
[7:19] and so I just want to thank the Lord for
[7:23] that and another little boy's name is
[7:26] Sammy and I went to school with his mom
[7:28] and he's autistic and has seizures and
[7:33] he has a dog that they paid $26,000 for
[7:37] to take care of him and the county that
[7:41] they live in to North Carolina raised
[7:42] the money for him well wolf is the
[7:44] little dog's name and he got attacked by
[7:47] some other dogs and got tore up and he
[7:49] went through some trauma and he's not
[7:50] responding to say me like he spokes to
[7:53] and so it's gonna cost you know they say
[7:57] somewhere between thirteen and thirty
[7:58] thousand dollars for another dog and so
[8:02] I just believing that the Lord had
[8:04] touched it touched wolf and he'll be
[8:06] okay but uh I was talking to a lady just
[8:16] this week and her son is having Tommy
[8:18] John surgery his name's Michael he's
[8:21] having surgery on his arm for Tommy John
[8:24] and he suffers from seizures also he's
[8:26] like 15 and I told her about Joseph I
[8:30] said we just had a little boy that just
[8:32] got healed and he's not all seizure and
[8:34] medicine so I'm uh
[8:37] getting a prayer cloth for him and I
[8:40] said we're gonna pray for his arm for a
[8:43] surgery but also he won't have to take
[8:45] it mess anymore get rid of that stuff
[8:48] I taught us just of the devil but we're
[8:51] just gonna continue beat that another
[8:53] another lady her son's name CJ he's the
[8:57] one I got a prayer cloth for it has I
[8:58] can't sir he's 23 years old and they're
[9:01] concerned about him losing his eye I got
[9:03] a prayer cloth for him the other day and
[9:06] they've been giving him eyedrops hoping
[9:09] that'll help and he told his mom the
[9:11] other day that he said I'm starting to
[9:13] see shapes and shadows in that eye which
[9:16] he didn't before so y'all just continue
[9:18] to pray
[9:19] I just thank the Lord for that y'all
[9:20] continue to pray for him there so
[9:24] they're still supposed to go into
[9:25] surgery and take the cancer and
[9:26] everything up but you know Lord's the
[9:29] first first step enough in the right
[9:31] direction so and my sister Janine she
[9:34] wants she wanted me get a prayer cloth
[9:36] first so I'm gonna get one for her and
[9:39] then remember brother Richard Douglas I
[9:40] know other people who work outside
[9:42] brother Richie works in the heat doing
[9:44] metal treatment and all kinds of stuff
[9:46] and he suffering really bad with cramps
[9:49] and he's you know and a lot of people
[9:51] that work outside suffer from that so
[9:53] y'all just remember brother Richie did
[9:55] not also and sister Regina sent a
[9:57] message out for us to remember him in
[9:59] prayer and other people work outside
[10:01] know they suffer from that too so I'll
[10:04] just think the Lord that we have
[10:05] somebody to go to when we have when we
[10:07] have needs and problems and you know
[10:10] some people some people are amazing they
[10:12] go on they prayed to God for him to come
[10:14] on the scene when he does something
[10:15] they're shocked by it you know my kids
[10:18] aren't shocked when I do something for
[10:20] my faith they come to me and say why
[10:22] didn't you do that what they expect it
[10:24] you know what they're not shocked when
[10:26] it takes place well you know our
[10:28] Heavenly Father's the same way
[10:31] though we don't have to be amazing if we
[10:34] believe because that he promised it
[10:36] it'll come to pass amen so tonight as we
[10:40] look in the scripture let's just all bow
[10:42] our heads and pray and just remember
[10:44] these needs in each one our Heavenly
[10:47] Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for
[10:48] another opportunity to be in your house
[10:49] Lord and this
[10:50] Lord feel your presence and know that
[10:54] you're the all-sufficient one Lord for
[10:56] whatever whedon whatever need we have
[10:58] whatever problem we have though we can
[11:00] just go to you and receive all that we
[11:02] have need of and father we just pray
[11:04] tonight you be with us help me tonight
[11:06] Lord Jesus just to say what you'd have
[11:08] me say and just Lord just help me get
[11:11] out of the way Lord and just bless the
[11:13] people tonight Lord for each need that's
[11:15] represented Lord for the ones that I've

[11:20] and and and CJ and Michael and all the
[11:23] ones Lord we just pray and brother reach

[11:26] them and just make your healing virtue
[11:28] manifesting in each one Lord for each
[11:31] hand that was raised Lord each heart
[11:33] Lord you know the need behind it and we
[11:37] just pray that we just Lord just help
[11:39] our unbelief Lord that we can get out of
[11:41] the way that you can work or if we just
[11:44] cast all our cares upon you Lord you
[11:46] said because you care for us or do we
[11:48] just look to you that you can come on
[11:50] the scene and move or let us not get in
[11:52] your way you know we just commit all
[11:55] things to you tonight we just pray that
[11:57] you bless the word as it goes forth Lord
[12:00] bless the speaker in the here in the
[12:02] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[12:06] Luke chapter 10 and verse 30 it's up
[12:12] there it says and Jesus answering said a
[12:16] certain man went down from Jerusalem
[12:17] Jericho and fell among thieves which
[12:20] stripped him of his raiment and wounded
[12:22] him and departed leaving him half dead
[12:24] and by chance there came down a certain
[12:27] priest that way and when he saw him he
[12:29] passed by on the other side and likewise
[12:31] a Levite when he was at the place came
[12:34] and looked on him and passed by on the
[12:36] other side but a certain Samaritan as he
[12:39] journeyed came where he was and when he
[12:41] saw him he had compassion on him and
[12:43] went to him and bound up his wounds
[12:45] pouring in oil and wine and set him on
[12:47] his Beast and brought him to an end and
[12:50] took care of him and on the morrow when
[12:53] he departed he took out two pence and
[12:55] gave them to the host and said unto him
[12:57] take care of him and whatsoever they'll
[13:00] spend us more when I come again I will
[13:02] repay the
[13:04] which now of these three thinkest thou
[13:06] was neighbor unto him that fell among
[13:09] the thieves and he said he that showed
[13:13] mercy unto him and then then said Jesus
[13:16] unto Him go and do thou likewise he
[13:20] meant and then Matthew chapter 9 verse
[13:23] 17 one scripture here says neither do
[13:26] men put new wine into old bottles else
[13:28] the bottles break and the wine runneth
[13:31] out and the bottles perish but they that
[13:33] put but they put new wine into new
[13:36] bottles and are both preserved amen god
[13:39] bless you tonight you may be seated
[13:45] getting on brother Wade's topic a little
[13:49] bit I've been been enjoying what brother
[13:54] Wade's had to say on the seals and you
[14:02] know this just trying to find the mind
[14:09] of God sometimes it's kind of hard and
[14:11] sometimes when you're tired it just
[14:13] sometimes you don't know if you're if
[14:16] you're coming or going you my brother
[14:18] Dale said when Sunday morning he didn't
[14:20] know if I was still out there working on
[14:21] the air conditioner or not but uh you
[14:26] know he heard the scripture and the
[14:30] thought tonight is being the old and the
[14:32] whine and you know in there in
[14:36] Revelation chapter 6 and way waits read
[14:40] it many times we've all read it but you
[14:43] know it says when he had opened the
[14:45] third seal I heard the third beast say
[14:47] come and see and I beheld and lo a black
[14:48] horse and he that sat on him had a pair
[14:50] of balances in his hand and I heard a
[14:53] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[14:54] say a measure of wheat for a penny and
[14:56] three measures of barley for a penny and
[14:58] see that thou hurt not the oil and the
[15:01] wine and brother branham and this is
[15:06] what that's what caught my attention
[15:07] brother Branham says in the church in
[15:08] 1954 this is in the church ages sermon
[15:11] that brother Branham preached he said
[15:13] all represents the Holy Ghost always
[15:16] and he says and we'll get to that
[15:18] marking marking the people Friday night
[15:21] notice he said but this ol represents
[15:23] the holy spirit he said that's why we
[15:25] anoint the sick with all is because it
[15:28] represents the holy spirit and then he
[15:30] goes on and he talks about Revelation
[15:33] chapter 6 and he said but hurting up the
[15:35] old and wine he said wish we was going
[15:38] to take revelations on through for a few
[15:40] weeks and get into that and get into
[15:43] that whoo that ol and windiest see you
[15:46] hurt not my Olin wine don't come near it
[15:49] Amen so you know what struck my
[15:54] attention was brother when brother
[15:55] Branham was speaking of that he didn't
[15:57] say what the olden wine was he said who
[16:00] the Olin wine was identifying this a
[16:03] person and so you know when you know who
[16:08] is the old and the wine when when he but
[16:12] when one comes when brother man preaches
[16:14] in the in the seal when he's preaching
[16:15] in the third seal and even in the fourth
[16:18] seal when when he's talking about who
[16:19] the Olin wine is he said who you know he
[16:22] said you can touch those people because
[16:25] you know he was really was restricting
[16:29] their their lifestyle you know there was
[16:33] controlling everything through the
[16:34] church but he told them he said he said
[16:37] you can he said you can touch their
[16:39] bodies he said but you can't touch their
[16:41] lives he said you can't put that
[16:43] anything upon them he said you can touch
[16:45] oh just like when God told Jobe told
[16:49] Satan he said you can touch job he said
[16:51] but there's a barrier that you can only
[16:53] come to he says you can do all these
[16:54] things he said but you can't touch his
[16:56] life you can do everything you want to
[16:57] do to him and you know that's what he
[16:59] could do he said because he they were
[17:00] anointed in their day to give their life
[17:03] because they were saying they were under
[17:05] there under that in the fourth and the
[17:08] fourth age you know they had that spirit
[17:10] of the ox to be to be sacrificial but
[17:15] you know one of the things is you know
[17:16] we look at that as being a
[17:21] as something that's being taken away you
[17:25] know because it is a beast of burden it
[17:27] is a sacrifice but you know there's one
[17:29] thing about it you know if I have
[17:31] something and you're going to take it
[17:34] away from me and I give it to you then
[17:37] you've not you don't have any victory
[17:38] you're not taking anything for me
[17:40] because I give it to you and you know
[17:42] those people you know he came to take
[17:44] something from him but those people gave
[17:46] it because they knew what the end result
[17:48] was going to be so it wasn't that Satan
[17:50] had any victory or because he was giving
[17:52] it to I mean they gave their lives
[17:54] because they knew what was going to take
[17:55] place that was the anointing for that
[17:57] day is to give their lives who say you
[18:00] know you know they could do those things
[18:03] but you know there was victory and what
[18:08] they were to do and who was the old in
[18:15] wine and you know the the parable that
[18:20] Jesus tells about the Samaritan you know
[18:24] here's a here's a man that that's fallen
[18:27] on hard times and was you know beaten
[18:29] and a half dead and you know here's a
[18:32] here's a man that the people that should
[18:34] have been the ones that should have been
[18:36] helping him are the ones that didn't
[18:37] help him you know they said here comes a
[18:40] certain priest along and you know the
[18:42] priest turned to the other side and
[18:44] didn't have any it didn't have any need
[18:47] for him or you know compassion for him
[18:49] just walk don't past him and left him in
[18:51] the ditch to die and then the Levite who
[18:53] should have known the law that if it was
[18:55] his brother according to the Old
[18:57] Testament law he should have helped him
[18:59] they didn't you know he just turn around
[19:01] and walked off also but you know one the
[19:04] one that was a low caste person a
[19:06] Samaritan who many people don't have you
[19:08] know they didn't have a lot to do with
[19:10] and didn't care too much for but you
[19:13] know he was the one that had compassion
[19:14] on this one man
[19:15] to take him in and treating and you know
[19:18] brother branham's talking about we're
[19:19] talking about in the scripture we talks
[19:21] about that he took him to a knee and he
[19:22] said that was the church you know how
[19:24] we're supposed to be that that help
[19:27] because you know brother Adam said that
[19:29] God's only hands are our hands he said I
[19:32] his mouth
[19:34] his feet anything about him is going to
[19:37] be you and I so when it come to being
[19:39] been the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[19:43] is you and I it's not somebody else you
[19:47] know brother Brenham said in he said one
[19:49] time he said he said the church is the
[19:51] blood of Christ by the spirit so if we
[19:55] if we are who that is one because
[19:57] there's not any other manifestation of
[19:59] Jesus Christ but us we are the we are
[20:02] the manifestation of Jesus Christ to the
[20:04] world so when it come to this who you
[20:07] know what what Jesus wants to or what
[20:10] God wants to make manifest in this hour
[20:12] is you and I it's not someone else and
[20:16] so if it's going to be the the word made
[20:19] manifest see there's not another age
[20:21] there's not another group there's not
[20:22] even issue and I we are the ones to make
[20:25] this more than manifest you know many
[20:32] times people people when they when they
[20:35] look at things at the scripture you know
[20:37] they want to separate these things but
[20:39] you know if we can if we ever come to
[20:42] the place to realize that you know when
[20:44] he said we're brother have said when
[20:47] when you and I when we come to the place
[20:51] that we say I and my father are one not
[20:55] just not just something that we say but
[20:57] it's something that we actually believe
[20:59] and we see by revelation and so when you
[21:03] when you see that when you speak that
[21:05] then he said then the shock will pull
[21:06] like something will take place but you
[21:08] know that's something that we've got to
[21:09] be able to see and you know if if we are
[21:12] if we are the blood made manifest if we
[21:17] are the word made manifest he said he
[21:19] said you become the word as you received
[21:21] the word so you and our the word made
[21:23] manifest in our day then we are also the
[21:28] OEL and the line because that is because
[21:30] the only player because if the ol is the
[21:32] Holy Ghost then you know it's not that
[21:34] you know sometimes we have a hard time
[21:39] actually believing that I think
[21:41] sometimes that people understand that
[21:42] you know though if the Holy Ghost is on
[21:44] the inside you know and get into some of
[21:48] things that brother Ram said you know
[21:49] the Holy Ghost is on the inside and he
[21:52] said he said if you know he said that's
[21:54] a hole he said that old he said so
[21:57] here's the Holy Ghost and if we know
[21:58] what the Holy Ghost is he said he's the
[22:00] he is the he's the seal baby but he's
[22:04] also the revealer of the word he's the
[22:08] God he's the one that lead and guide you
[22:10] into all truth he's the one that will
[22:12] overcome when you can't overcome he's
[22:15] the one so it's not that we're waiting
[22:16] on something to come and it's not
[22:18] something that we're looking for
[22:19] something else because what we have need
[22:22] of lays inside of us the overcoming
[22:24] power lays inside of us so it's on the
[22:29] inside because later on we'll get to a
[22:31] brother branham talks about he said it's
[22:33] not just when wouldn't we look at the
[22:35] wine the wine is not just stimulation of
[22:39] Revelation but in the fourth seal
[22:41] brother Adam said it's the power of
[22:42] stimulation of Revelation well you have
[22:45] power see the thing is is if you have
[22:49] the Holy Ghost on the inside of he's if
[22:51] you have him by a new birth if he's
[22:53] birth to you by the word in the net and
[22:56] to your soul then there becomes a change
[23:00] in you but there's also a time that
[23:02] you're supposed to be growing but there
[23:05] also should be a stimulation take place
[23:08] because you know it's so amazing that
[23:11] people claim to have the Holy Ghost but
[23:13] you know there's things like there's no
[23:14] stimulation now I'm I'm not saying that
[23:19] we're all supposed to stagger around
[23:21] like drunk people but you know what that
[23:23] should something should take place you
[23:26] know because they should change the way
[23:27] you and and I understand you should
[23:29] change the way you think it should tell
[23:31] you to change the way you walk the way
[23:33] you talk and you know the thing is is
[23:34] there should be get the burning desire
[23:36] and if there's not a burning desire
[23:38] inside of you to be more like him that
[23:40] you know what we all need to be in the
[23:41] altar because there should be a change
[23:44] and it should be on fire and if it's not
[23:46] on fire than you know because when
[23:48] brother Branham talked about the the
[23:50] candlestick and he said he said when the
[23:52] candlestick was in there he said that
[23:54] flame was the holy fire of God and that
[23:56] was the Holy Ghost that would let that
[23:58] candlestick and he walked in the midst
[24:00] of it now
[24:01] was the same burning fire and he wanted
[24:04] to be made manifest he walked in the
[24:07] midst of the candlestick why because he
[24:09] was showing himself but you know what he
[24:11] was not showing himself as male but he
[24:14] was showing himself as female he was
[24:16] showing why because he was showing the
[24:18] bride on display and because that's what
[24:21] it is it has to be the bride on display
[24:23] why because he came and walked in the
[24:25] flesh and he in the end he stood there
[24:28] and he told him he said church the
[24:30] Scriptures he said and show me where
[24:32] I've missed it
[24:33] where did this where I haven't fulfilled
[24:35] the word in them you think you have
[24:39] eternal life but they are they that
[24:41] testify of me
[24:42] he's what he said he told him and Nero
[24:45] didn't even Nicodemus and the ones you
[24:47] know they had to rule it you know stand
[24:48] there and testify that he was exactly
[24:51] one thing what the scripture saying and
[24:56] you know what that's the same way you
[24:57] and I - hey you and I are the word big
[25:04] benefits sometimes I don't know about
[25:11] you I'm just gonna preach all myself
[25:12] nothing you know awake thou that
[25:20] sleepest why because sometimes we don't
[25:24] recognize who we are we don't recognize
[25:27] what lays inside of us what what lays in
[25:30] what is in store what what we protect
[25:33] what our potential is what we possess we
[25:38] don't we don't realize that and
[25:42] sometimes if we you know because the
[25:44] devil we allow the devil to just do
[25:46] whatever he wants to you know I was
[25:51] listening to brother band the other day
[25:52] and you know he's talking about Joshua
[25:55] you know Joshua was given a commission
[25:59] you know Joshua walk behind Moses and
[26:03] you know he'd see Moses and you know
[26:06] when Moses was on the backside of the
[26:08] desert he thought he was a failure and
[26:10] he was out you know God was bringing
[26:12] Moses exactly where he wanted
[26:15] and yet when he got when he got to that
[26:18] place that God spoke to him through a
[26:20] burning bush and you know he had his own
[26:25] supernatural experience with God it was
[26:27] a revelation to Moses of who he was and
[26:30] you know Joshua walked all of those
[26:32] years behind Moses and seeing the things
[26:34] and hearing and understanding and seeing
[26:37] what God had spoke through him and it
[26:39] come to pass and he went through all of
[26:42] that time and he saw all of the things
[26:45] that Moses but you know what God had his
[26:47] own experience and revelation to Joshua
[26:51] to who he was he said as I was with
[26:54] Moses so I'll be with you he said Moses
[26:57] my servant is dead but you know what he
[26:59] said there's still a commission that has
[27:00] to be done he said by calls he said
[27:02] Moses carried on out of Egypt he carried
[27:05] him through the wilderness he said we
[27:06] carried him over we've showed him the
[27:08] land the spies have went over they've
[27:11] taken the fruit they've brought it back
[27:12] and they brought the evidence back and
[27:14] showed that the land was exactly the way
[27:16] that God told them that it was going to
[27:17] be and he brought him right up there and
[27:19] he told him he said now it's time to
[27:21] sanctify yourselves and get ready to
[27:23] cross over and you know Joshua had
[27:28] walked all of those years but you know
[27:29] what Joshua had his own experience here
[27:32] because you know what God spoke to
[27:34] Joshua just like he spoke to Moses but
[27:36] he had his own experience and you know
[27:38] that's exactly what you and I've got to
[27:40] do we've got to get to a place where God
[27:42] gives us our own experience that matches
[27:45] together because that's not based on
[27:47] anybody else because let me tell you
[27:49] something brothers and sisters it burns
[27:51] inside of me but you know what I can't
[27:53] go in on anybody else's experience
[27:55] I can't experience anything else what
[27:57] anybody else has had I got to live on
[27:59] the experience that I've had from myself
[28:01] I think you know brother Dale can't
[28:03] carry me in brother way can't carry me
[28:05] in and you know what that help they'd
[28:07] hate to have to carry me in physically
[28:09] or naturally or spiritually anyway but
[28:15] you know what I mean
[28:16] brother Dale's shoulders are only so big
[28:17] but you know what you've got to have an
[28:19] experience for yourself but you know
[28:22] what the land is a gland before you is
[28:24] flowing with milk and honey is exactly
[28:26] the way that God said it was
[28:28] want to be but you know what you've got
[28:30] to go and experience that for yourself
[28:32] if you gave you go to the place that God
[28:35] can show you exactly what the word says
[28:37] that it's just for you
[28:39] you know Joshua had heard the word from
[28:43] from the prophet Moses and you know what
[28:44] he actually went into the land and so
[28:47] the people sold the land so everything
[28:52] brought the evidence back to the people
[28:54] you know what he was ready to go right
[28:56] then why because something that stirred
[28:58] inside him that he hadn't seen what God
[29:00] had promised him well my thing my
[29:09] question to you is if God's if God has
[29:11] showed you the same thing would you be
[29:13] sitting around one big do you say are
[29:19] you stimulated because you know what
[29:21] Joshua was Caleb was you know what they
[29:27] were ready to go you know in all those
[29:31] years of after they've seen after they'd
[29:33] seen that and walking around dealing
[29:35] with all of them stiff neck people and
[29:37] and all the problems that they had to
[29:39] deal with you know Caleb he never lost
[29:41] his revelation he never lost his zeal
[29:44] for what belong to him you know for all
[29:47] the years that he had to go through and
[29:49] all the things that he had seen you know
[29:50] the only thing that was holding him back
[29:52] was everybody else you know he had to
[29:54] walk around in desert for years and
[29:57] years and years and years and have to
[29:58] deal with all of that that foolishness
[30:00] but you know what
[30:01] Caleb never lost his zeal never lost his
[30:03] desire it was still a burning fire
[30:05] inside of him and you know what caleb
[30:07] was down there all the time and you know
[30:09] what he was doing he was sitting there
[30:10] sharpen his knife and a sword
[30:12] he kept it things why because he didn't
[30:14] know where he was going over but you
[30:15] know what there was one day he was going
[30:16] in 80 years old and you know what he
[30:21] told him he said you know I'm just as
[30:23] good as I was when we went in spies and
[30:25] got the grapes and seen all of the
[30:27] evidence and come back and gave them the
[30:29] good report he said I'm just the same
[30:31] man he said I might look a little old my
[30:33] lost some hair might have been gray
[30:35] might a little bit stoop-shouldered but
[30:37] you know what something burned inside of
[30:39] him that it was so strong that you know
[30:41] what you couldn't stop
[30:43] that's the reason when he went to Joshua
[30:45] he said give me my mount right one
[30:48] because they've been standing there
[30:49] waiting on it for so long your brothers
[30:53] and sisters you know what it's time to
[30:55] get out of here it's time to get to a
[30:57] place that you know what this this world
[30:59] it's not in my home we get sick and
[31:01] tired of living in this world in this
[31:03] pest house and when we get tired of it
[31:06] and you know what we can call for God's
[31:07] a Lord come take us home get us in the
[31:10] word Lord Jesus but if no well brother
[31:20] brother Jewell says wells he wells he
[31:22] woo we'd still dealing with the same
[31:25] problems but you know what if we if we
[31:29] get that desire you know waking we can
[31:32] go on you know you know God took care of
[31:41] him all those years he fed a manna he
[31:43] took care of their clothes there are
[31:45] clothes never wore out they said they
[31:47] never got sick all the things I went
[31:49] through all those 40 years and you know
[31:51] they never had a problem but you know
[31:54] what their biggest problem laid between
[31:56] their ears you know that's where their
[32:00] problem was they never got past that
[32:02] they got out of Egypt they never got
[32:04] Egypt out of them
[32:08] you got feed them God feeding them manna
[32:11] angels food supernatural food all the
[32:16] time but you know what they never did
[32:18] get past that and you know the day that
[32:24] they came up and and it was time to go
[32:26] into the land you know
[32:28] when they went in he said the manna
[32:30] ceased they said when no when they went
[32:32] in said it said they ate the old corner
[32:35] of the land you know what there was
[32:36] something else that was beyond what
[32:38] they'd already had there was a greater
[32:40] revelation brother Bram said it was
[32:42] stronger meat it was strong meat he said
[32:45] they were bigger stronger things of God
[32:46] that were beyond what they had where
[32:48] they had been they'd seen all these
[32:51] things they've seen all these miracles
[32:53] and God do everything and yet here was
[32:55] something else
[32:55] them to move on you know people you know
[32:58] we've come to a place you know there's a
[33:00] greater a wonderful bigger place for us
[33:02] to go to higher heights and deeper
[33:08] depths with God that's where you and I
[33:16] are we have to believe that that belong
[33:22] that it belongs to us brother brems says
[33:30] in in the third seal he says when the
[33:36] truth of a promised Word of God has been
[33:39] truly revealed to his Saints that's
[33:40] filled with all they all get stimulated
[33:42] one is a stimulation glory he said I
[33:45] feel it now stimulated with joy shouts
[33:48] and when it does it has the same effect
[33:50] on them that wine does then does a
[33:52] natural man cause because when the
[33:54] revelation has been given of a truth of
[33:57] God and the true believer filled with
[33:59] all and the revelation is revealed the
[34:01] stimulation becomes so great that it
[34:03] makes him behave himself uh normally
[34:07] glory maybe that's what's wrong with him
[34:10] now that's right it makes them behave
[34:11] themselves unseemly so God has a promise
[34:17] for us just like he had for the children
[34:19] of Israel and you know what it it should
[34:23] we should have a stimulation because it
[34:25] says if you're filled with the Holy
[34:26] Ghost and you receive the word then you
[34:27] know what there's a stimulation that
[34:29] takes place so we need to have some
[34:35] stimulation take place you know when you
[34:41] look at this this hole and the wine when
[34:47] you see this in the scripture
[34:51] you know grapes now in the scripture
[34:58] most all is made by olives it's olive
[35:03] oil remedy covers it in the church age
[35:06] book that's what was in the was in the
[35:08] lamp stance that they put in was olive
[35:10] oil hey you know great grapes they make
[35:13] wine and one of the interesting things I
[35:17] found out about this is you know the
[35:20] same process to make olive old they used
[35:23] to make one because the first the first
[35:26] step that takes place is you got a crush
[35:28] on you got to take the olives and you
[35:30] got a crush on and you got to crush the
[35:33] grapes to get the essence out of it and
[35:36] then you know they just crush them and
[35:38] they lay them the olives have to lay out
[35:41] because they say the essence of the
[35:43] aroma of the olives has to be marinating
[35:46] them to marinate the oil you know to be
[35:48] pushed out so it stays there and then
[35:50] when you push the grates
[35:52] you know you have to lay them out and
[35:54] then you know over time they start to
[35:56] ferment and everything but you know when
[35:58] you push those olives out and you just
[35:59] lay them and crushed in a in a paste or
[36:03] whatever they do then you know after
[36:05] they sit for so long then they have to
[36:07] put pressure on them you know they have
[36:09] to press them and you know what was so
[36:13] amazing was when they when they started
[36:15] talking about how much pressure has to
[36:16] be applied to olives to get the oil out
[36:18] of them they said sometimes I have to
[36:20] put as much as 400 atmosphere pressure
[36:23] on there and if you don't know what that
[36:25] is it's one atmosphere is equal to about
[36:28] sixteen point nine psi so if you
[36:31] calculate that out to around fifty eight
[36:33] hundred psi has to be put on olives to
[36:36] push the oil out of them and you know
[36:38] because you know there and then you know
[36:41] what struck me is you know people wonder
[36:42] why you know brother Graham said you
[36:45] know the life of a Christian he said
[36:47] when you become a Christian he said
[36:49] every gun inhales at you you know why do
[36:52] we go through the things that we go
[36:54] through you know here you are here you
[36:56] crush them and then brother branham said
[36:58] the only way that you get any good out
[37:00] of something is you have to crush it you
[37:03] know brother Brown was speaking in
[37:05] his life story and he was talking about
[37:07] when sister hope was dying and Sharon
[37:10] Rose was dying and you know he was
[37:12] talking about having to go through there
[37:13] and go see see his wife died and his
[37:16] daughter died and you know all the
[37:18] things that he had to go through and you
[37:21] know he said he went in there and he saw
[37:22] Sharon rose laying there and her the
[37:25] meningitis had got into her body and you
[37:27] know was ravaging and her eyes had
[37:29] crossed and you know he said you know
[37:31] she it was such a was and such you know
[37:33] a struggle for you know she was such
[37:37] laboring to breathing and everything
[37:40] under that strain of that meningitis you
[37:42] know he said I just couldn't look at her
[37:43] you know it was breaking his heart and
[37:45] he said you know because he we wonder
[37:47] why we have to go through things but you
[37:48] know that's the way God modes us through
[37:51] the things that we have to suffer you
[37:52] know he said Jesus was made perfect
[37:55] through the things that he suffered and
[37:56] you know many times we wonder why we
[37:58] have to go through these things why
[37:59] because it molds us into who who God
[38:02] wants us to be into molds us into his
[38:04] image and you know we you know we look
[38:06] at things and say well I don't know why
[38:08] God has you know allowed these things to
[38:12] happen but you know it was one of the
[38:14] ladies that I was talking to and I can't
[38:18] remember who was but one of the ladies I
[38:21] was talking to recently and you know
[38:23] she's telling me about all the different
[38:26] things that happened and in her life and
[38:28] you know she said but you know she said
[38:30] I know one thing she said I know all
[38:32] things work together for the good I
[38:33] don't understand why these things happen
[38:35] in my life you know why things have what
[38:38] happened you know it's happened the way
[38:39] they are you know everything such a
[38:40] struggle she said but there's one thing
[38:42] I know he said all things work together
[38:44] for the good he said that she said
[38:46] that's the one thing that I can hold on
[38:47] to because I know that's a promise of
[38:49] God you know we wonder why we have to go
[38:52] through things but you know that's what
[38:53] God has put us through to bring us to
[38:56] these things why because there's a
[38:57] pressure that's applied to us to mold us
[39:00] into who he wants us to be
[39:08] and so God wants us to be in his image
[39:13] and so we have to go through these
[39:15] things to mold us and you know there's a
[39:18] pressure that has to be applied but you
[39:21] know what it brings out what's inside
[39:23] those olives and you know the when you
[39:28] crush the grapes and you know you lay
[39:30] them up in the heat and and all that and
[39:32] you know you put them all through those
[39:34] things you know while while they have to
[39:36] go through those things why because it
[39:37] brings out the essence of what what's in
[39:40] those the grapes and everything there's
[39:42] a prayer and you know sometimes you know
[39:44] the the harder the battle in our lives
[39:47] sometimes you know it's the sweeter the
[39:49] victory you know many times we go
[39:51] through things and we wonder why if we
[39:53] went through them and we don't see it
[39:54] but you know there's one day we look
[39:55] back and you know we think I understand
[39:57] why those things took place and you know
[39:59] we can look back and thank God because
[40:02] many times we think we've been Forsaken
[40:04] and we're all alone and we struggle with
[40:05] these things but you know what these
[40:06] days we look back and we thank God you
[40:08] know what God brought to me through
[40:10] something God made because I can stand
[40:12] up and I can thank God for what he's
[40:14] brought me through because you know I
[40:15] may not I may not I've always come
[40:18] through everything exactly the way that
[40:19] I should have but you know what God's
[40:21] brought me through and I can thank God
[40:23] for what he's done in my life because
[40:25] like that like that sister said she said
[40:27] I may not be what I want to be and I may
[40:29] not be one or all to be but I can thank
[40:31] God I'm not what I used to be one
[40:33] because there's been a change take place
[40:39] so we thank God for the problems and
[40:42] trials and why because just like when
[40:47] job God knew what job could handle but
[40:51] you know what he had to prove to job
[40:52] what he could handle the job could come
[40:56] through those things you know it's a you
[41:01] know do we sometimes it's be nice to
[41:04] thank God thinks of us the same way
[41:05] thought of job you know he told you know
[41:09] he told Satan he said you know have you
[41:10] considered my servant job he's upright
[41:13] and perfect
[41:15] wouldn't it be amazing to God you know
[41:18] God said have you ever considered my
[41:21] servant my son
[41:22] what a wonderful how great he is because
[41:27] you know what he's got confidence in it
[41:29] right because you know he knows what
[41:32] you'll do with the work he'll know what
[41:34] you'll do in situations and he'll know
[41:38] and he's got confidence in you and you
[41:39] know sometimes we don't have confidence
[41:41] in ourselves but God has confidence in
[41:43] us you know sometimes we think well Lord
[41:49] how are we going to get how are we gonna
[41:50] get through this how you know how am I
[41:52] going to get through this and and all
[41:53] these type things sitting you know just
[41:56] like that man said one time you know
[41:57] there's a little story about the man and
[41:58] you know he was out mountain climbing he
[42:03] was in the dark and he slid down the
[42:04] mountain he called her one little brush
[42:06] and God kept telling me he's hanging on
[42:09] that thing for dear life it's the middle
[42:12] of the night you know it's dark and he's
[42:14] just hanging on that thing and he just
[42:15] prayin to God he just struggling holding
[42:17] on and the Lord kept telling him just
[42:19] let go he's like new Lorca he kept
[42:23] telling Lord kept I'm just let go he's
[42:26] like no he's just struggling holding on
[42:28] holding on he's getting tired but he was
[42:31] he was not gonna let go he's just
[42:32] struggling struggling struggling and
[42:34] lore kept trying to tell him just let go
[42:37] no he done that all night till the Sun
[42:40] come up when the Sun come up he realized
[42:43] he was only a foot up off the ground but
[42:49] you know what he said Terry struggled on
[42:51] I but God was trying to tell him there
[42:52] was firm foundation under him but you
[42:54] know what he didn't believe that say God
[42:57] don't God don't always tell us the
[42:58] situation he don't always give her but
[43:00] you know what he wants us to put our
[43:01] trust in him because you know what he'll
[43:03] bring us through many times we struggle
[43:08] with things and you know what God's just
[43:10] want us to turn turn loose can you let
[43:14] go and let God move if you can do that
[43:16] then God can come on the scene because
[43:18] sometimes he's already got you know
[43:19] because you know I got the answer he
[43:20] don't sometimes out of the answer he's
[43:22] always got the answer
[43:23] he just want you to trust him that you
[43:25] can step out and actually see what what
[43:28] God's plan is
[43:29] in these situations
[43:40] now this is a from the message the Pat
[43:45] miss vision and brother brems speaking
[43:46] of the of the bowls and they all and he
[43:51] and it's the from Zachariah where he has
[43:55] the vision of the trees and everything
[43:57] and he says the two trees represents the
[43:59] Old Testament and the New Testament and
[44:02] he said of course the old typifies the
[44:04] Holy Ghost who alone can give the light
[44:07] of God to the people he said the angel
[44:09] spoke to Zechariah was as much as saying
[44:11] this what you see means that the church
[44:14] cannot accomplish anything by its own
[44:17] might or power but by the Holy Ghost say
[44:21] God wants us to put our trust in him
[44:23] because if we put our trust in him then
[44:25] he's got a plan he's got a way to work
[44:28] things out he just want you to trust him
[44:30] because you know what you can't do it in
[44:31] yourself because that's what he was
[44:33] showing see it's you can't do it in your
[44:35] own self and many times the Lord is just
[44:38] he's just gentleman enough to allow you
[44:41] to get out and work yourself up into a
[44:43] frenzy and not get anywhere and spin
[44:45] your wheels and get tired and you'll say
[44:47] would you like to try it my way they
[44:54] said it and said this bowl is filled
[44:57] with olive oil which floats through the
[44:59] seven weeks which are placed in the
[45:01] seven arms this is the same oil that
[45:03] burns and makes a light and the seven
[45:05] pipes and he continues on through the
[45:08] through the paten miss vision explaining
[45:10] the different the different things of
[45:12] how each each of the lamp was was lit
[45:15] and has the same Holy Ghost fire burning
[45:18] all lamps in all seven Church ages so it
[45:21] was the same Holy Ghost in every seven
[45:23] of the church ages it was the same fire
[45:25] of God that barked and so there's no
[45:28] difference in what took place in each
[45:29] age because it was he was the same
[45:31] yesterday today and forever
[45:37] and on the in the in the fourth seal
[45:40] brother rim sis speaking of the wine he
[45:42] said in the OL symbolizes the Holy Ghost
[45:45] Holy Spirit we find out that oil and
[45:48] wine is connected and worship always
[45:50] connected and worship and we always find
[45:52] in the scripture you always find the OL
[45:54] and the wine together and one other
[45:59] things when you when you go and study
[46:02] you start studying the whole and the
[46:03] wine the other thing that you find out
[46:05] another place that comes up in and Joel
[46:09] and some other places giving is when he
[46:13] talks about the oil and the wine because
[46:15] in Joel 2 when Joel start speaking of
[46:20] restoration coming we talked about the
[46:23] rain the form of rain in the ladder rain
[46:25] coming and he's right before he talks
[46:27] about the restoration of what the bugs
[46:30] ate down right before that he talks
[46:32] about restoring the all the wine and the
[46:35] corn because there's a corn because that
[46:38] was like the Old Testament when they
[46:40] went into the land there was the old
[46:41] corn of the land that they ate when they
[46:42] went in and so that was the restoration
[46:45] of the word but it was also restoration
[46:47] of power because that's what the corn
[46:50] was because that's what they were eating
[46:52] was but from the old because that was
[46:54] the strength that they laid over there
[46:56] that power that laid over there and so
[47:00] you know there's a there's the power
[47:02] they talks about you know when when the
[47:04] wine they said the wine symbolizes the
[47:07] power of the stimulation of Revelation
[47:10] then you also see where he talks about
[47:11] the corn of that they ate which was the
[47:14] you know eating the word and reached the
[47:17] the the power that came with the opening
[47:21] of the word and said with something
[47:24] that's been revealed it gives
[47:25] stimulation to the believer because it's
[47:27] presented by revelation see it's
[47:30] something that God said it's a mystery
[47:32] they can't understand it see after a
[47:34] while God comes down and reveals it and
[47:36] then vindicates it and then he says we
[47:39] remember if the truth is revealed the
[47:41] truth is also vindicated because you
[47:44] know if God ever come down and reveals
[47:46] anything he also vindicates it he never
[47:48] comes without vindication of the word
[47:50] because he's always done that all the
[47:52] way through because if God ever said
[47:54] anything he said when God said let there
[47:56] be light he said and there was like that
[47:59] was the vindication of it and you know
[48:01] the thing is if God ever speaks to you
[48:03] many people many people have you know as
[48:05] brother mystical say you know people say
[48:06] oh I got a revelation
[48:07] I got a revelation you know about you
[48:09] know you know they've got a revelation
[48:11] well you know what if they don't ever
[48:12] change your life and if ever don't ever
[48:14] make a change you know what you didn't
[48:16] get a revelation you know the thing is
[48:19] just like the Apostle Paul you know when
[48:21] he was going down the road you know what
[48:23] he had an experience that happened to
[48:24] him that you know what he was blind and
[48:26] you know all these things and God spoke
[48:28] to him you know what he had her head
[48:30] experience that changed his life because
[48:33] you know what he carried that that that
[48:37] what the blindness and you know the
[48:40] problems with his eyes the rest of his
[48:41] life you know he never could get away
[48:43] from that but you know here was a man
[48:46] that was very zealous in what he
[48:48] believed and you know he thought he was
[48:50] correct and living living in the Old
[48:52] Testament and and being a Pharisee of
[48:55] the Pharisees and you know being
[48:57] circumcised on the eighth day and all
[48:58] the things that he could look back and
[49:00] say you look what I've done in my life
[49:01] and you know what he said he didn't care
[49:03] he didn't consider any of that he
[49:05] considered it all done all that was
[49:07] nothing because you know what God come
[49:09] and spoke to him and he said you know
[49:11] because he said the Lord who art thou
[49:13] and he said I'm Jesus whom thou
[49:15] persecute us when there was something
[49:17] that come and struck Paul and then
[49:18] knocked him down on the road when he
[49:20] come to that place you know people had
[49:23] seen a change in him because you know
[49:24] they knew what kind of man he was and
[49:27] all of a sudden they come to see what
[49:28] kind of man he is
[49:30] wonder what the future you know the past
[49:34] you know people didn't want to have
[49:36] anything to do with Paul you know people
[49:40] didn't believe that that Paul was a
[49:42] changed man but you know what through
[49:46] their through his life through the his
[49:49] experience you know he just wasn't
[49:52] something that Paul talked about people
[49:54] seen there was a change in him and the
[49:55] way that he came because you know and
[49:57] what was so amazing was you know Peter
[49:59] walk with Jesus and James and the ones
[50:02] that
[50:03] with Jesus and and topped it and slep
[50:05] and all the things they talked about
[50:06] they could talk about handling Jesus and
[50:09] you know all the things that they had
[50:10] where was physical and all the
[50:13] experiences they had with him but you
[50:15] know what Paul had the Old Testament and
[50:17] he had a had a present-day revelation of
[50:19] what the Old Testament had to say but
[50:21] you know he had the same revelation that
[50:23] Peter had that he was preaching there
[50:25] and he said do you know all the way
[50:27] through the Old Testament and all spoke
[50:28] of Jesus Christ you know everybody just
[50:31] talked about it was it was do's and
[50:32] don'ts and rich Wilson and all these
[50:34] different things but you know what when
[50:35] it came to Paul you know he said he said
[50:37] you're dull of hearing he said we can
[50:39] talk about all those things but he said
[50:41] you know it's all Jesus Christ all those
[50:43] things that were written in the Old
[50:44] Testament all spoke of Jesus Christ and
[50:48] when he wrote it when he brought it to
[50:50] the present day and looked at see it was
[50:52] Jesus Christ all of those Old Testament
[50:54] prophets all they talked about and all
[50:56] over their lives manifested Jesus Christ
[50:58] but people didn't see that
[51:10] he says when God tells you anything heat
[51:13] and says you go do this and I'll be
[51:16] right with you for this is my word and
[51:18] he shows it in the Bible than God stands
[51:20] right behind that he said if it's not
[51:22] written in the Bible God stands behind
[51:24] anyway anyhow if it's God's Word
[51:33] he said now the power of Revelation
[51:36] brings stimulation to the believer for
[51:39] the power of moyen natural one is to
[51:41] stimulate and it brings a person that's
[51:43] all slumped down to us to a stimulation
[51:46] he said well not well then now there's a
[51:49] power of the revelation of the word
[51:51] gives stimulation of joy to the believer
[51:53] stimulation of satisfaction the
[51:56] stimulation that it's vindicated it's
[51:58] proved it's called in the scripture as
[52:00] we went thought to refer to it as new
[52:03] one he said it's a natural one they said
[52:08] we always refer to it like that as these
[52:12] are drunk only ones see alright or
[52:14] spiritual one I think the best
[52:15] interpretation would be on spiritual one
[52:18] as the natural line reveals itself and
[52:20] stimulated power so does the new one as
[52:23] they reveals the Word of God which is
[52:25] spirit and then and that's say the word
[52:30] itself is spirit you believe that let's
[52:32] read it he said let's read it st. John
[52:35] six and he said something something said
[52:40] that let's say who said it goes on John
[52:43] st. John 6 chapter he said is the spirit
[52:46] that quickeneth the flesh profiteth
[52:48] nothing the words that I speak to you
[52:51] they are spirit and they are life he
[52:54] said the word itself is spirit it's
[52:56] spirit in Word form then you see when
[52:59] it's quicken or brought to life the
[53:01] spirit of the word goes to work an acci
[53:04] because that now look here a thought has
[53:07] to be a thought before it can be a word
[53:09] and then a thought is presented it is a
[53:12] word now this is the this is God's
[53:14] thought has placed in the word and then
[53:17] when we receive it from him it becomes a
[53:20] word
[53:22] so we are to not only to hear the word
[53:28] because you he said God had a fault and
[53:30] then when he gave it to the prophets and
[53:33] they spoke it it become a word so it
[53:36] will become the word and you know the
[53:38] same thing is it has to be to you God
[53:41] can can come and speak to you but you
[53:43] and I have to speak the word also he
[53:46] said so when a spirit-filled born son of
[53:49] God he said when he takes the word and
[53:53] puts it on his lips and believes in his
[53:56] heart he said it's the same as deity
[53:58] speaking so when when God when God gives
[54:02] the word to us to speak then if we have
[54:05] faith and believe what he said and we
[54:07] speak it then it's the same as him
[54:08] speaking it so if just like just like
[54:12] when when a you know child goes through
[54:14] adoption when they come to that when
[54:16] they come to that place to adoption you
[54:18] know they can speak and do the things
[54:20] just like the Father it's just the same
[54:22] thing that the father says when they do
[54:24] it it's just it's the same thing and you
[54:27] and I are the same way if God gives us
[54:29] the word and gives us the promise that
[54:31] you know it's for you to speak it's for
[54:34] you to claim what God has said to you
[54:36] has given you these things so there's a
[54:43] there's a power that you have if we can
[54:48] speak because of work because the power
[54:51] comes through the spoken word so you
[54:53] speak in the word that you believe in
[54:56] the word and then we have a powers acts
[54:59] one says you know he said you shall
[55:01] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[55:03] is come upon you there's a power that
[55:05] you can receive if you speak the word
[55:07] and believe it then there's a power that
[55:09] comes to you you know we're not we're
[55:14] not powerless we're no we're not we're
[55:17] not weak but you know what we have
[55:18] exactly what we have need of what we
[55:21] what we need and he said and you shall
[55:24] be witnesses you know a witness is
[55:27] somebody that speaks and as and knows
[55:30] something you know yeah there ain't no
[55:32] such thing as hearsay you know you can't
[55:35] you can't say what some
[55:36] l said you know there's very there's
[55:38] very strict rules in court on hearsay
[55:42] you know the the you know when you go
[55:44] before the judge you know what I heard
[55:46] so-and-so said to so-and-so and
[55:48] so-and-so I think we don't want to hear
[55:49] none of that you know we want to hear
[55:51] from somebody they won't know what you
[55:52] know what you saw what you heard that
[55:57] you can testify about not what not what
[56:00] somebody else's because you know the
[56:02] thing is is you can't say because you've
[56:04] got to know that he's real he said he
[56:07] that cometh to God must believe that he
[56:09] is so you've got to know that you got to
[56:13] believe that you've got to speak that
[56:15] for yourself you've got to know who he
[56:17] is and you got to speak for yourself to
[56:19] know these things and no way don't so
[56:21] don't believe them because you know it's
[56:23] not what the god of brother Dale or God
[56:26] of brother John or whoever else you know
[56:28] it's it's it's who that who do I serve
[56:30] you know he's a real to me not not what
[56:34] somebody else said he was
[56:38] do you do you know that he's Hebrews
[56:41] 13:8 is there some is there some place
[56:44] in the scripture that you've tried God
[56:47] and he's and he's not giving you that
[56:50] you know the scripture said God said
[56:52] prove me you know that he said prove me
[56:58] and see if I won't pour out the windows
[57:00] of heaven but you know he said he said
[57:03] the problem is and he said you know they
[57:04] have nothing you've not rounded to me
[57:08] you know in the Old Testament you know
[57:10] when he took the the Ark of the
[57:15] testimony you know we call it the Ark of
[57:18] the test you know covenant but you know
[57:20] it's also known as the testimony it's
[57:22] the Ark of the testimony why is it
[57:24] called the Ark of the testimony you know
[57:27] why because the scripture says that God
[57:29] told Moses to put those articles in that
[57:31] in the ark why because it was a
[57:34] testament against the people it was a
[57:37] testament against them why because they
[57:39] went out there and complained and they
[57:41] didn't and they didn't believe that God
[57:43] was going to take care of them said you
[57:44] know what he put manna in the ark why
[57:46] because he showed he took care of their
[57:48] physical needs why because they went out
[57:50] through there and oh you know they were
[57:51] so longing for the garlic's and the
[57:55] leeks and all the stuff from from Egypt
[57:58] but you know what God fed them and gave
[58:00] them exactly what they had need of you
[58:02] know what they didn't believe that God
[58:04] was going to lead them through but you
[58:05] know what he put Aaron's rod that budded
[58:07] in there and put the almonds in there
[58:10] and then you know when when he put the
[58:12] test when he put the tablets in there
[58:14] you know when the tablets were in there
[58:16] why because you know why the first set
[58:18] didn't even make it there why because
[58:21] you know when Moses went on the mountain
[58:24] and talked talk to God and God come and
[58:26] talk to Moses and wrote the word down
[58:28] for him you know what were that what
[58:29] were the children of Israel doing what
[58:32] were they doing they were down there
[58:33] committing idolatry with a golden calf
[58:36] and then Aaron was so silly
[58:40] when he wasn't totally for his brother
[58:41] went before the Prophet said oh I just
[58:43] threw a bunch of gold in and a golden
[58:46] calf popped out
[58:51] really here's a here's a man that's been
[58:56] 40 days before God getting the Word of
[58:59] God face to face ear to God's mouth roof
[59:03] through receiving the word and you know
[59:05] what they're down there committing
[59:07] idolatry and when Moses come off the
[59:09] mountain he took the tablets and he
[59:10] smashed the Golden Calf and you know
[59:13] what Moses had to go back and get to
[59:15] have you get the tablets again why
[59:17] because the second set went in there why
[59:19] because it was a Testament against there
[59:21] because you know what they didn't
[59:22] believe what God said why was it because
[59:26] you know and it's the same way with you
[59:28] and I the word has been given to you and
[59:30] I and you know what it's either a
[59:31] blessing or cursing to you he bugged one
[59:34] because you know what if we don't
[59:35] believe what God said he that he's gonna
[59:37] take care of us so you know it's a curse
[59:38] to us it's either your blessing or a
[59:45] curse
[59:46] one because if we don't believe we don't
[59:49] trust God to meet our needs and you know
[59:51] what if we and we go through things and
[59:53] we don't put our faith in God to meet
[59:55] our needs or whatever our problem is and
[59:57] turn it over to God and we go through
[59:58] problems and trials and everything like
[1:00:00] that and we wonder why why because we
[1:00:02] cannot put our faith in God
[1:00:08] people go through things and wonder why
[1:00:10] God don't bless them well you know what
[1:00:14] and sometimes you know if I had if I had
[1:00:18] people believe in me the way people put
[1:00:20] faith in God you know what I wouldn't do
[1:00:22] nothing for him either you know he stood
[1:00:28] there he said Williams talking to the
[1:00:30] children of Israel you know he said he
[1:00:31] said when he sent him prophets you know
[1:00:33] he said grace sent him a brazen serpent
[1:00:36] a walk that followed him the head water
[1:00:38] he said he gave him a pillar of fire a
[1:00:40] cloud by day and a fire by night he said
[1:00:43] he took Kevin done everything for him
[1:00:44] and you know what they still couldn't
[1:00:45] believe him all the things that they'd
[1:00:49] done through all through the Old
[1:00:50] Testament sent all the prophets the
[1:00:52] judges and everything else has sent him
[1:00:54] till then you know what they still
[1:00:54] turned his their back on him and Jesus
[1:00:59] come walked in walked in flesh John come
[1:01:02] on though on the river and went down
[1:01:03] there and told him said you know what he
[1:01:05] said he said I'm the one the voice of
[1:01:07] one crying in the wilderness but here's
[1:01:08] wanders walks among you he said I'm not
[1:01:11] I'm under worthy to unloose his shoes
[1:01:13] but you know what I sang baptize you in
[1:01:15] water but he said he'll come and baptize
[1:01:17] you in fire the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:01:19] here's exactly the one that God spoke
[1:01:22] through all the way from the beginning
[1:01:23] when Adam fell in the garden and he gave
[1:01:26] him and told him he said they'll come
[1:01:27] one
[1:01:28] he said that old bruised the Serpent's
[1:01:30] head he said but he'll bruise his heel
[1:01:32] but he said he'll crush his head he said
[1:01:35] he said when he walked out of the garden
[1:01:37] and he made a wait for the children to
[1:01:39] come back the Adam and Eve to come back
[1:01:41] because there was one that was going to
[1:01:44] come and cover that chasm that was
[1:01:46] created by Adam and Eve there was one
[1:01:48] that was gonna come and do that and when
[1:01:50] he came in flesh they didn't even
[1:01:51] believe him and you know what God's
[1:01:58] given us everything we have need of you
[1:02:04] know what
[1:02:05] whether we're the most blessed people or
[1:02:06] the most well God God has God has
[1:02:09] blessed us have more grace than anybody
[1:02:11] you know what there was all the people
[1:02:14] through the Old Testament and all the
[1:02:15] different ones Paul looking and and all
[1:02:18] the different people that desire to say
[1:02:20] are they the promises are laid in the
[1:02:22] scripture and you know what all those
[1:02:23] things have laid in our day you know
[1:02:25] it's not somebody else's good let's
[1:02:26] receive this you know what this is the
[1:02:28] endtime the word has become open the
[1:02:33] fullness of the word has been open
[1:02:34] there's nothing for us
[1:02:36] yeah else to come because you know what
[1:02:42] if if if God didn't come and fulfill his
[1:02:47] scripture through the word through
[1:02:49] brother Branham then you know what God's
[1:02:50] a liar God but you know what I don't
[1:02:57] he's not a liar but you know what
[1:03:01] everything that you have nito has been
[1:03:03] given you know and and all the all the
[1:03:05] mysteries and everything that has laid
[1:03:07] in the Old Testament all the scriptures
[1:03:09] that they're laid back there that people
[1:03:11] who have been desiring to see you know
[1:03:12] what you and I can read about he said he
[1:03:17] said why was prophecy he said now is
[1:03:19] history and you know what you and I are
[1:03:22] able to open up and read and see the
[1:03:24] things that God laid in the word that
[1:03:26] people have looked over for many many
[1:03:28] years many commentaries have been
[1:03:30] written many books many many hours of
[1:03:33] studying these things and you know what
[1:03:35] there was a little man that came from
[1:03:37] Kentucky you know hardly had any
[1:03:41] education nothing nothing to look at but
[1:03:45] you know what God spoke through him he
[1:03:47] was God's mouthpiece for our day you
[1:03:52] know I'm not ashamed of this message I'm
[1:03:55] not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ why because it's the power of God
[1:04:00] unto salvation why because it's the
[1:04:02] power of God to bring us out of here I'm
[1:04:05] not I'm not ashamed that I thank God
[1:04:07] that that he's allowed me to see these
[1:04:09] things but you know the thing is is we
[1:04:11] need to have have faith and believe what
[1:04:13] God is saying why because you're so
[1:04:17] blessed one because he spoke in this
[1:04:19] word if he come and he said that Malachi
[1:04:21] if brother Branham fulfilled Malachi 4
[1:04:24] that he said he'd send Elijah the
[1:04:25] Prophet before the great dreadful day of
[1:04:27] the world of the Lord and that he would
[1:04:29] come and he would he would open the
[1:04:31] scripture and turn the people's hearts
[1:04:33] back to
[1:04:33] word that if that's true then guess what
[1:04:35] then that you and I are the same ones
[1:04:37] that we have received the work to take a
[1:04:40] body change we are the ones to whom the
[1:04:52] world the ends of the world are come all
[1:04:58] the scriptures that speak of our day you
[1:05:02] know we're a blessed people but do we
[1:05:11] actually believe that have we have we
[1:05:13] put our faith in that do however you
[1:05:15] know how we sold out everything to put
[1:05:19] our trust in him to put our faith in
[1:05:21] that word you know the scripture will
[1:05:27] finish here in a minute the scripture
[1:05:29] talks about the Jesus was speaking there
[1:05:33] and Lucan in and in Matthew and I think
[1:05:40] he's Matthew Mark and Luke he tolde
[1:05:41] tells the same story about the about the
[1:05:44] skins you know he says he said you know
[1:05:45] you can't put new wine in old bottles
[1:05:48] you know brother Brent talks about those
[1:05:51] old bottles he says you know they were
[1:05:52] made out of animal skin he said the
[1:05:55] animal skins because you know he said
[1:05:57] they animal skins had the oil still in
[1:06:00] them because the skin hadn't dried out
[1:06:02] and they were able to put the wine in
[1:06:04] those bottles because and you know he
[1:06:06] talks about there was a hundred on the
[1:06:08] day of Pentecost there was a hundred and
[1:06:09] twenty bottles up there waiting to be
[1:06:11] filled and he said you know they could
[1:06:13] expand with the pressure of that wine
[1:06:15] you know and God could could move in
[1:06:18] their lives and do the things and you
[1:06:19] know the same thing he said you can't
[1:06:21] have a dried-out try to have a
[1:06:23] Pentecostal experience and be all dried
[1:06:26] out and have your own formal ways about
[1:06:29] you you've got to have the OL of the
[1:06:32] Holy Ghost in you that you can expand
[1:06:34] that God can move you and grow and mold
[1:06:37] you into what needs to be done but see
[1:06:39] the thing is as brothers sisters do we
[1:06:41] actually have that do we actually say
[1:06:43] Lord moved me into what I need to be
[1:06:45] don't don't
[1:06:46] let me just become dried out in formalin
[1:06:48] and you know let let all the things the
[1:06:51] cares of life overtake me the Lord moved
[1:06:55] me into what I need to be because that's
[1:06:57] what I want to be I want to be though
[1:06:59] because you know I want to be the word
[1:07:01] made manifest I want to have the Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost and I want people to know it I
[1:07:05] want people to see when they look at me
[1:07:07] it's not Erin Roberts Stacy but I want
[1:07:09] people to see Jesus Christ I want people
[1:07:12] to know that there's something because
[1:07:13] you know it's not just some I walk down
[1:07:15] the aisle and I just walked up and I
[1:07:17] just told the preacher that I wanted
[1:07:19] want it to be saved or something I want
[1:07:20] something that's live and real I want
[1:07:22] people to know something that that's
[1:07:24] taking place not just some idea or
[1:07:26] general just we just come to church and
[1:07:28] pay ties or or just sit around you know
[1:07:30] we just talk about things in the message
[1:07:32] but I want it to be real
[1:07:33] I wanted something that's growing inside
[1:07:35] of me I wanted something living inside
[1:07:36] of me then when somebody sees me they
[1:07:38] know that I'm a Christian not just some
[1:07:40] because you know lots of times you meet
[1:07:41] people in the world and sometimes even
[1:07:43] in this message you meet people and you
[1:07:45] know what you can't even tell that
[1:07:46] they're Christians you can't even tell
[1:07:48] their message people why because they
[1:07:51] just want to hang out and see how folks
[1:07:53] they can get to the world and how much
[1:07:55] world that they can have inside of them
[1:07:57] and how much they you know they can try
[1:07:59] to balance themselves I don't want any
[1:08:01] of that I want I want to be solely sold
[1:08:03] out I don't want anything I don't even
[1:08:05] Justice the smell or the smudge or
[1:08:07] anything of the world on me I don't want
[1:08:10] to have any of that I want to be sold
[1:08:11] out where I'm totally oh gods I don't I
[1:08:15] don't want anything else I want I just
[1:08:17] want exactly what God wants me to me I
[1:08:19] want him totally to be surrendered and
[1:08:21] molded and just what God has for me to
[1:08:24] be because you know the thing is is you
[1:08:28] and I can come to that you know because
[1:08:30] there's a lot of young people I see
[1:08:32] young people and you know the thing is
[1:08:33] is you know in the the devil it will
[1:08:36] talk to you and the devil would tell you
[1:08:38] everything and he will point out all
[1:08:40] your faults and failures and you know
[1:08:42] what you can root you can listen to that
[1:08:44] and he can cause you all kinds of
[1:08:46] problems and I've seen kids that were
[1:08:48] drew it they grew up in this message and
[1:08:50] you know what one little problem one
[1:08:51] little fall or failure coming in our
[1:08:53] life and you know what Satan beat some
[1:08:55] down so let's you know what they don't
[1:08:56] even come to church anymore they just go
[1:08:58] out in the world why because
[1:08:59] they think they've send their way though
[1:09:01] away their day of grace but let me tell
[1:09:04] you something brothers and sisters you
[1:09:06] know what God is you know what if God
[1:09:08] ever deals with your heart you know
[1:09:10] brother and said hey still there's still
[1:09:12] grace for you there's still mercy for
[1:09:15] you but the thing is is you've got to
[1:09:17] believe that you know I know I want kids
[1:09:19] to see that I want the kids to know that
[1:09:21] no matter how old you are how young you
[1:09:24] are you know don't think that God's ever
[1:09:26] done we're done with you or there's some
[1:09:28] kind of problem if God's dealing with
[1:09:34] your heart there's still grace they're
[1:09:36] still mercy you know what if he's done
[1:09:40] it for one you know what he'll do it for
[1:09:42] another I don't know if I I think I've
[1:09:48] told this before by move and we'll tell
[1:09:50] it again the first time I got baptized I
[1:09:54] got baptized when I was eight years old
[1:09:56] me and Richard got baptized the same
[1:09:58] time and you know I was so excited to
[1:10:05] get baptized eight years old you know
[1:10:10] because I sing that was scriptural I
[1:10:12] wanted to get baptized and you know I
[1:10:19] you know I being eight years old you
[1:10:21] know there's you know there's only so
[1:10:23] much you really understand but you know
[1:10:25] I didn't know what was gonna take place
[1:10:27] but you know what I knew I need to be
[1:10:29] baptized
[1:10:31] but you know the day after I got
[1:10:33] baptized that Monday morning I woke up
[1:10:37] because I got baptized on Sunday the
[1:10:38] Monday morning I woke up that was one of
[1:10:40] the sickest I was sick the sickest I've
[1:10:43] ever been that day I was so sick I had I
[1:10:46] had some kind of stomach virus and let
[1:10:48] me tell you what I thought I was going
[1:10:50] to fall apart I hurt so bad and just
[1:10:55] just what you know and the whole time
[1:10:57] you know what I said around you know and
[1:10:59] the devil got on my shoulder you know he
[1:11:01] tried to tell me that I was wrong
[1:11:03] because I wouldn't got baptized and
[1:11:04] that's the reason I was sick and you
[1:11:09] know I said around you know and I felt
[1:11:10] so bad and I carried that for so long
[1:11:13] that I was under condemnation because
[1:11:16] you know being 8 years old you know what
[1:11:18] would you think if you if you went to go
[1:11:20] get baptized in the next day you're sick
[1:11:22] as you can be and I lived through that
[1:11:25] and you know and it was it was such a
[1:11:27] condemnation I lived under this cloud
[1:11:29] and it's like well lord what did I do
[1:11:31] wrong
[1:11:34] and you know and you know sometimes
[1:11:36] things happen in your life you know what
[1:11:37] that you know I look back at that you
[1:11:40] know maybe that's what God sitting me
[1:11:42] because you know what he wanted to make
[1:11:44] me stronger why because you know what if
[1:11:48] you try to walk before God and do what
[1:11:50] God wants you to do it's the devil's job
[1:11:52] to get in front of his dog it's his job
[1:11:55] to hinder you it's just his job to do
[1:11:58] everything that he can to stop and for
[1:12:01] me to walk around as an eight-year-old
[1:12:02] kid wondering what I'd done to deserve
[1:12:04] that
[1:12:05] you know God God's punishing me for
[1:12:07] something you know it hindered me but
[1:12:11] you know what he took me a while to get
[1:12:13] over that and you know many times thing
[1:12:15] well things happen in our lives we don't
[1:12:17] understand but you know what don't let
[1:12:20] the devil get in before you and get in
[1:12:22] your mind and tell you things that are
[1:12:24] contrary to the word because you know
[1:12:27] what if God puts it in his word for us
[1:12:30] to bleed and repent and be baptized then
[1:12:33] you know what just expect the devil to
[1:12:35] come against you whatever happens is for
[1:12:38] a reason but you know what God is able
[1:12:41] to bring you through and show you that
[1:12:44] his love because you know God wants you
[1:12:47] to follow his word that's the reason
[1:12:48] they gave it to us and the other thing
[1:12:52] if God give his word and you say well I
[1:12:56] can't I can't make it I can't thought
[1:12:58] you know what God is able to bring you
[1:13:01] to the place that you can do that if
[1:13:04] they're if God has given his word for us
[1:13:07] to do it just like that just like that
[1:13:09] little black man said that time you know
[1:13:11] hey they said well what happened if you
[1:13:12] know if the Lord told you to go jump
[1:13:14] through that wall he said well if it was
[1:13:16] in the Bible for me to jump through that
[1:13:17] wall he said I'd take off running
[1:13:18] because if God's obligated to put a hole
[1:13:20] there when I got to the wall it's my
[1:13:26] it's my job to do what I do my part and
[1:13:29] you know what then God's obligated to do
[1:13:31] his part let's do it let's just do our
[1:13:35] part let's be faithful and what God has
