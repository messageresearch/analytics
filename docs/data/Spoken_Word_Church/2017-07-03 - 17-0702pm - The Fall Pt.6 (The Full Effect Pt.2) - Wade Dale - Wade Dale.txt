========================================

I want to try to make this one the short one if that's he possible he floats the first slot vanishing so y'all remember some of y'all know some of y'all don't a few years ago and I was born she was pretty mature and she was about a seven and a half pound premature baby so she had underdeveloped lungs and we gave we made this announcement that he's going to pull up here and gave it out that shows kind of what what I want to talk about here not that slide the other one please but anyway this is her when she was sick and that's her after she at the Lord touched her but basically she was a big preemie and so she had underdeveloped lungs and she had a hard time getting oxygen into her body the lowest point she was at was maybe on was the third night she was she got down to 38 percent oxygen saturation and her blood and that was before she got transported so we don't really know how bad she really got but most of you remember some of you don't know but uh she was really close to dying and there's one thing I wanted to add that I never did say in the original testimony that I had a lot of fear okay and I think some of y'all might have thought that because I was so overcome with fear that I blew this out of proportion but she really was on death's door okay I mean we me and Gabby were in this boat together and the Lord Jesus that was there but we didn't think he was we thought we were forsaken he was asleep on the boat so to speak and uh and so those were really big waves all right that we were facing and on the this is one part that I didn't share just to show you how sick she was that the paramedic when they transported down to Egleston the first thing this lady said to Gabby the paramedic said I never lost your baby twice okay she was really close to dying she nearly lost her baby twice so but then on the third on the fourth day Sunday morning the Lord raised her up she began to mend and so we thank the Lord for that that was the original announcement that we had made and then go to the other side please this is the new one on your way out today on the right side over on the right where the offering boxes and the prayer requests everybody every family please get one at least you know what maybe one for now of the original testimony there's 30 minutes long some of you came into this church since that time so you haven't seen it you already have one get another one that's fine and they're right beside it there's this pictures and moving up to dates that we made and says who the by the help I've come that's a quote from the song first and also from First Samuel 7 where Samuel raised up that stone called Ebenezer that's why I'm doing this today it's a memorial because it's her third birthday I want to keep reminding y'all of what the Lord did because we don't want to forget never forget it's hard to see this on here but and then that scripture that was so meaningful to us during the whole trial there is no fear in love first John 4 because there's two things the Lord did during this testimony he delivered us from the spirit of fear he showed us how to overcome the fear that even if our baby died doesn't doing a good to fear regardless of the trial you face don't fear and the other thing was of course he healed our baby and Gaby can you bring up other see if she'll come up she wants to tell you a little something go back to the other slide please sorry to keep switching them good job okay now we're back to sit hunger come closer ha who's this oh that's me sick so sits over here no good now who's that in the middle perfect Jesus on the cross why'd he get up there to find out all night no perfect yeah you make you better can you say thank you Jesus say I love you Jesus [Applause] [Music] it's in black notebook dr.

leave a bunch so when Terrance sticks that thing done is you go teaching from doing that maybe you got your Bibles let's go ahead and turn to 2nd Corinthians and continue on we didn't finish obviously we didn't even get close to finishing the we're still on the fall showing the full effect of the fall and now we want to finally get to two likes Li Fe s not lives life's - life's right by the way of announcement you've heard all the ones and they're all on the internet but make sure you remember that next Friday there are several of you are going good many of you going to brother Tim Hughes I'll be preaching at 7:30 next Friday not this coming Friday the next Friday the 14th of July will be service on Friday night up there in Kings Mountain North Carolina so keep us all in your prayers if you want to go y'all all kind of get together and figure out we're going to be going June and I'm going to be going up early so we'll already be there about lunchtime so other than that you've got all your other announcements downstairs so let's bow our heads before we get started the Heavenly Father we pray today Lord that you'll come among us in a way that you know how the service is going to turn out but we don't so you take full control Lord and you'd be the one that does the speaking the hearing you're the only one that can reveal you're the only one who can put the right words in the right place you're the only one that can smooth it over if we as humans try to mess it up Lord you are the one that knows all things and you before the world started what we will be doing here Lord now I pray that you would reveal to us Lord our plan our position our place Lord what we're doing here the time and all the things that we were going through even in life and also now in the eternal part that we're looking at may we Lord slip into eternity today and just look at the supernatural just for a moment and see what you're doing in our life we ask you Father to forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord as we come together to meet you Lord we pray that you would just be with the ones that are sick that are here ones that are sick that are not here be with the ones that are bound by sin by Satan Lord we pray that you just break those bonds and let it be that the Word of God would take over probably give us a day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses in Jesus name we pray amen second Corinthians 5 verse 1 Paul says for we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for it in this we groan in this we groan desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found kid four we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now let's go to Galatians two and kind of take our take our text here like we did last Sunday this would just be part two of two lifes Galatians 2:20 listen to Paul I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live he's a living human man nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ now liveth in me all right and the life which I now live he's constituting he's living a different life the life that I now live the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing for the reason of the word I'm not going to use them the board today I don't think we'll just kind of coast through this with some being out and all I just want to kind of background but thank God for those of you that are here man alright so we were talking last Sunday and I want to read you I read it last night but brother Dale's been preaching on the condescending of God's showing that God is real but if you look at it this way because this really helps me his condescended to express his reality not to make him real think about that he condescended the way he's condescending is the way he's wanted it done and you know what like I said last night and I've got said in a Bible study the only way you going to understand God is by that Bible right there a man there's no other way you say well I don't understand it you pray for a revelation because actually God's not going to come down and write you a 67th chapter of the Bible he's not going to come and write you or revelations 23 just because you're some special something no he wrote this Bible 66 books for man to realize the reality of God and as he kind of sins he expresses his reality it doesn't make him real he was real before all this ever started but the condescending of God which to me the condescending of God is the my as man preaching the only am we going to get it is preaching I'm sorry just blew the foolishness of preaching that's the only way you're going to get it's only going to understand God sure you're going to get your point you're going to get your eyes you're going to get your thoughts but when it comes down to where God is going to condescend from something we have no idea to now it's going to take somebody to break it down for you ma'am so we see to that that so the condescend he condescended to express his reality think of that that was his expression of his reality that didn't make him real he always runs with harmony words mercy see but I don't know she thought thank you for the water previous messengers has ever brought me water before most time it's ugly Bob brings it up here man but the condescending of God so listen what I'm trying to say is is we struggle about whether this is right and this is wrong and who said this and this said what just realize one thing God's already put in place somebody listen somebody is going to see it or he wasn't written it this way that's the way I see God God by his foreknowledge wrote this Bible with us already in it and with everything we need to get back to where we love got lost from the man so there's no other way that we can get God here it's by other than his word all right no other man you say Oh what about this prophet y'all call this William Branham listen man's ideas got involved like me and Dave was talking yesterday I believe God he had a conduit he had a prophet that he could speak to and he spoke to that prophet and through that prophet gave it to me and you and not so that's going to be people in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God be finished all right so that's what we're looking at the mystery of God what is God is this God real is this god this is this God that the only way we're going to get it is that God comes down through a funnel called a prophet because remember the brother Ram said I am nothing but a trumpet I am nothing but I'm mute the problem is we kind of try to toot our own trumpet every once in a while and we're not mute like real Adele said we need to shut up listen sometimes instead of doing the talking so brother Branham he listened to God and let God do the speaking and I believe that's what we have to get our perfection comes through the message of the hour the revelation of the message of the hour and then not just the message of the hour and I got a little thought on that in just a minute but let's go back to where we were Sunday and just kind of run through this real quick because we believe that God is a being he is a real person he is not the a myth he is not Casper the Friendly Ghost he's not some some something that that we thought about no he's a real person and and as brother Dale said we know now they lie similarity of even what he looks like Amen so we have we are so fortunate but you see somebody like Abraham he comes up and he's walked in his life and he meets this man named Melchizedek and then he meets Melchizedek I want to tell you this because remember he meets Melchizedek when he's a young man younger then he meets Melchizedek when he's old and I want to tell you something Melchizedek man daddy was talking yesterday Melchizedek listen if I'm coming up to a 99 year old man or 499 year old man is sitting in the tent none of year 99 yet just a clearly getting close but at 99 years old as a human being and some old man that looks older than me walks up and says I'm guarding I'm going to change your body now to me you understand what I'm saying but old man walks handed according to the table of life let me sit down a minute I'm going to change your body now Abraham wouldn't have a lot of faith but male calves didn't come walking with two other men to other angels and I believe he was in the prime of his youth and he said Abraham according to the time alive I'm going to come down and I'm going to give you that promise son I'm going to change your body to look like mine because I'm not an old man God never was an old man never will be an old man I can't I don't know we're men man's ideas fathom that God is great bearded stoop-shouldered with a cane come on people good grief God never did get old amen so now we see that he meets Melchizedek which is God in human flesh but not God the Savior God in human flesh the theophany the same one that Moses saw and as we were looking before let's look at that in the Hebrew lexicon when Moses met the pillar fire he met a man because a bush don't talk a bush doesn't talk if a bless talks it's a man hidden in the bush but when you look up this Strong's Concordance that fire that was burning in the bush look like their supernatural fire accompanying theophany so we know that that was the very theophany of God now Moses couldn't see him in that revelation at the point in time of Moses in Revelation he saw a burning bush but he was a he was well learned enough to know and smart enough to realize that that wasn't a normal bush because number one it wasn't consumed and burned up and all that thing's talking to him and he says I am that I am and if you're going to come any closer Moses you need to take his shoes off because you're standing on holy ground so we know exactly who that was that was a pre figure of Jesus Christ mmm are the theophany of God now remember we were talking about it last Sunday Joshua Joshua comes up and he sees or then Moses you see Moses he comes up just leave it right there but remember Moses comes up one dances God I want to see you I saw you the burning bush I saw you do that I saw you do that but I want to really see you he said okay go stand in the rock and I'm going to walk by well he didn't walk him float by the bow he walked by it was a man God always was a man he never was a spook as we want to sometimes we get in our brain that that God's just something that has no substance you realize one thing's for sure whatever this substance you're standing on and this whole universe is made out of came out of that one man he didn't have to go and ask the daddy if he could do it he didn't have to go and ask the Holy Ghost if he could do it he didn't have to go and get a manufacturing plant to manufacture it all came right out of him so did you gosh when he came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a there stood a spirit no they said a man there stood a man he must have been pretty real and I've been he was old in either I don't believe God ever does never appeared anywhere old Cody never was old behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand he come to do something he didn't have a sword in his any sheath he had to sort out and Joshua went under them and said unto Him art thou for us are you for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the capital L Ord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship now Joshua is not going to just worship a man that just walks up with a sword wrong he must have had a supernatural revelation who that man was and sent unto him what staff my lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host sent unto Joshua loose tie shoes you ever heard that before that's exactly what the burning bush told Moses loose tie shoes from off thy foot for the place were on thou standest is holy and you know what Joshua didn't have a problem with it Joshua did so so there's Jesus Christ now look not Jesus to flesh but just to back up just a minute for some maybe he's not been here that's not Jesus to flesh Jesus a flesh came 2,000 years ago and man but Jesus Christ created all things according to Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 John 1 James was it 3 and 9 Jesus Christ created all things they know he was a creator that's the problem that they have with a Trinity one of the problems that Trinitarians have with the Trinity is that you know some say well the father created the sun and then the sun created all things well then you can't call the father the creator but if you lump them all together you love them all together they created all things Jesus Christ created all things because he was that King theophany he was not something that was a that was a man standing here and then it like brother Dale said there's not going to be a father we're not going to see an old man as a father and then a son and see the whole ego you better not you might see it in a different place but you're not going to see in heaven hello you just might see it if you go to another place but you're not going to see in heaven we're going to see Jesus Christ and know that he is the very embodiment embodiment of the Father he is the father made manifest King theophany I like that because listen anything that comes from him because remember Satan can't create that's one of those things that we're talking about we we use deductive reasoning Satan cannot create so if there's any life that's ever created God creates it and then God created every life God even created at off Hitler's life what we're gonna get into Adolf Hitler the most vile man on the earth anyone you want to talk about that life had to come from Almighty God permitted life because he said multiply and replenish the earth well now we know that he was talking about Genesis 1:26 man that we've been drawn on on the board at Genesis 1:26 man has nothing to do with a sex desire multiplication that's what happened after the fall that's why we believe that the fall was not an apple if not then if we just go to Washington State and buy all the apples and hand them out we'll all go back to being I don't think so but it was act in the garden the guy listing started so will not get into that but we don't believe it was an apple you can't beguile somebody with an apple you understand one thing and the Bible says that you're the fruit of your mother a man so you watch that fruit part it's not a fruit - somebody ate it was what they / - cuff a man and it wasn't an apple but what was it it began a carnal mind that the poor Adam bless his heart he come to a place that he was the ruler of everything every animal obeyed him every tree obeyed him the Sun the Moon the Stars you know they were all up there hanging and the wind would come down into this part of the earth and start blowing and it would blow a little bit too much and Adam would say hold it back just a little cloud you need to move over that way a little bit I want some more sunshine but then all of a sudden one day he comes to a place that that doesn't work anymore he's what he's lost his rulership on the earth now he's not lost his salvation he's not lost his kinship with God I like what her brother said in New Mexico he didn't lose his relationship now sure we know they didn't talk to each other like this but his relate if you're related that's what relationship comes from I'm related to him because I came from him he didn't lose his relationship with God in that form he lost his fellowship that's what we're hot we're coming back to that fellowship we're not losing our relationship I read to you today remember what I said brother mine said Christ did not come to bring you your inheritance your inheritance was before the foundation of the world and man that's your relationship you and God are related if you're born again come on somebody hallelujah you're you totally come from genetics of God if you're born again but right now we're having to deal with my mama and daddy brought us all right so that's where you get you two lives and we'll get into that right here in just a second now let's go to number let's read number one and kind of review just a second skip that other Isaiah 9:6 but number one then two months abruptly God said and then no doubt in my mind but that's what Jesus had in his mind when he was here on earth was that infallibility of God's eternal Word for we know that in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily the entire Godhead was in him he was both Father Son and Holy Ghost but dwelt in a human form the theophany of God the great image of God that he made man in he's throwing it back to us then placed him in the earth he had a body God isn't without a body God's got a body and it looks like a man Moses saw it others saw it and it looks like a man and it's just an impression now here we're going to come down to here with we've talking about Redemption we brought that Genesis 1:26 man there was no way that that Genesis 1:26 man in the Old Testament could go into the soul of an individual now tell you why in just a little while he cannot get into the soul of an individual in an Old Testament why number one the blood of bulls and goats only covered his sin it did not do away with this sin it was what they live by faith but they did not receive the promise we were talking about last night Hebrews 11:40 we always say they without us not being perfect but read verse 39 those people in the Old Testament died with a good report that the Messiah was coming they were looking for the Messiah the Messiah was coming but they did not receive the promise what is the great promise that we're all promised repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive a promise a gift of the Holy Ghost so they did not receive that gift because the giver had not come and give it to him yet hey man that Genesis 1:26 man was so tied up in that King theophany he had no place to come to and he had no place to land as I'm telling you before leave that up I read it a minute that does clip in the ark when the Dove lands in the ark remember he brings the leaf back most I mean no one knows that there's dry land somewhere but remember he releases the DOE and the Dove doesn't come back he knows that dove landed somewhere well and type that dumb never landed anywhere until he landed in Jesus Christ on the day that God took him to the river and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell but what the lamb met the Dove that's what the property God said what the two natures were the same amen listen David was a great man all these were great men but they never received a promise they never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul there was still something missing and then now this is the plan of garden would you like it or not I'm telling you the plan of God he's actually the way he give it all right so now look and this is just an impression this is of what that is and everything on earth the beauty the sweetness the beauty of the earth is nothing else in the world but an answer to a far better than that that waits on us when we leave this world for everything in Earth is just a pattern of that which is in heaven everything that's good everything that's righteous everything is it's beautiful trees birds everything is just a pattern of what's in heaven our own life it's just a pattern we think so much of this say pamper it make sure it smells good which is great when you're sitting in a group of people make sure it smells good but anyway we and we let the inside man rot come on then we do our own life is just a pattern it's just a shadow and not the real thing listen that's the way we can exist under this condition even the property guard told us he said he said that blood cover and still covers there he said god only hears your voice through the blood because remember this flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God this flesh and blood if he were to come down and judge you by what we're doing right now we'd all have to die and I didn't say was all going to help I said we'd all have to die because this right here cannot make it it has not been redeemed the inside man has been redeemed but not the outside man all right but we're working on it where's Rebecca Atkins he's still word you need to sing that song you need to sing that song next Sunday he's still working on me make me what I ought to be what is that ought to be it's that God son before the fact the real part of you don't you ever think about that one Sam I've seen that song he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be listen I didn't ought to be Samuel and Peggy son I ought to be a son of God and man well I guess that didn't make you happy but it didn't mean it's a shadow and not the real thing it's the negative side it takes death to develop the picture to put us back in the theophany we came from now remember you and I were never let me say it one more time I like it when that thing rings yeah we were never identities in heaven we were never running around up here talking about each other and forget that we were in God we were in his thoughts we weren't in his thoughts we were II thought hey man to put us back in the theophany we came from we came from King theophany one man and then that's our problem now on earth we come from many men you remember what brother Brown said he said your problem is you came from a woman hello your problem is is you came from a woman he said you come from a man cross Jesus he said you will be this way and then when you're born again you're not born again of a woman thank god you're not born again of a woman you're born again of your daddy because then your father is the life that all right to put us back into theophany we came from then in the resurrection we come in his likeness a resurrected body what a beautiful not only beautiful but it's the real solemn truth of God's eternal word that will be like him number two let's go that it's a continuation kind of the entombment 1970 57 excuse me here he goes where did he leave when he left Bible said he ascended he went and preached now this is stop here just a second that all that whole Genesis 1:26 and 27 man I hope you understand we we made a list of what he was but that Genesis 1:26 and 27 is your new birth it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that burns you out and puts him in ok that's what that Genesis 1:26 man that what we lost we're going to read it and who this milk as it we bypassed that why because sin cut us off he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison so when Jesus Christ walked on the earth when Jesus Christ walked on this earth I walked on this earth with him when he said I am the resurrection in the fool watch it preacher when he said I go to him when he said I come from oh we don't want to finish those because we don't kind of believe that if he was King theophany there was no that's the oppening that made any difference to me now it may to you but to me that theophany is eternal life never was judged never had a beginning never will have an ending I want that I want that I didn't come there with that but that's what I want and that's what I believe our God you got to believe it for you right but when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee I walk the story go away with him I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna tell you something listen the only way you going to understand what we understand in this end time is to have that same man inside of you I've told y'all many many times before God wrote this Bible that great theophany wrote this Bible and if I have part of that great theophany in me that makes me where I can understand this by because you can't understand this Bible without having the one that wrote it inside of you other than that it's just a commentary I preached laughs I'll keep you awake a commentary I mean sure it really is it's just a commentary to most people but to me he wrote that Bible for me not for you no you wrote it for me me you write it for you too man what about that I told you out everything anything we need for the guy here why because he knew when we got here we need it to me that's so simple so when God died at Calvary God died yeah God died his flesh died his soul that Great King theophany you can't kill you can't kill your theophany your theophany can come down in the middle and like I said before of an atomic explosion right in the middle of it you can be holding on to the bomb with your theophany and it would never flow and never do a thing never even you won't even go and never bother you but doing this see what you got two lives for two the life's I won't say lives it's like two life's and we'll get into that in just a second all right all right so when Jesus died he died to take my place and then that King theophany where'd he go he went and preached to the souls that were in prison what is that somewhere in Hebrews I can't remember they might know exactly where did remember he said he went and preached the souls in prison in the long-suffering the days of Noah in other words the people that had died before the flood Christ was going down to say hey I'm the one Noah told you about right all right but what did he go down there in in his flesh know his flesh was up in Israel or Jerusalem laying in a tomb dead in the hammer dead is a hammer there was no life in it because that life had come out at Calvary but what did the property go tell us his soul his spirit his theophany of his own being went down amen so now like I've always told you if you have that part of Genesis 1:26 that theophany inside of you you've already been to hell that throws my soul you've already been to hell you don't have to go twice you went one time he died once for one all he died what's wrong how about them but if we don't accept him me and Joe was talking a few minutes ago brother Brian said well the Bible the hell was created for the devil and his angels right probably God told us he said that hell wasn't even created for human beings hell not created for human beings but if you don't accept Christ that's where you're going you know when they died that brother on cities and whatever the tree whatever wherever it leans and follows that's the way it lays all right amen what a great thing that brother branham's could go across the curtain of time and see a 90 something year old woman that had been converted in his ministry being a real young 20 year old lady just skipping and huffing and jumping all over the place how about of what a wonderful thing that this Genesis 1:26 man can do this Genesis 1.6 man remember it never had a beginning so it never got old that's why the Prophet could tell us he said God took a picture of you 18 to 20 years old not exactly when you were that here but exactly that theophany the part of the words you are he took that picture in that picture it's burning his memory listen it doesn't matter if you never ever see your children again this is just a natural story if you never ever see your children again you can close your eyes and see them every one why because it's burning your memory of what your children are well same way with Almighty God's they gonna get this up in a minute same way with God there's a picture burning his mind and look this is all permissive this is all permitted by God we're all getting older and God we don't get older and man everybody all right say ma'am we might get hot in a minute that's okay so anyway let's go to number three yeah let's finish that lets go to number three life 1957 let's just review this just and watch because what happened on the day of Pentecost God comes down remember God has sins Jesus Christ ascended up alright and he told them to go and he said eleven days later he said you're going to be in dude from power from on high in other words what I'm going to do I'm going to start building the real family that I should have had had there not been a fall I'm the first one of it because in Genesis in revelation 3:14 it says Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God the beginning of the way it should have been had they not been a fall so Christ was the first one remember he was born without sex and then so he was the beginning of the creation of God but you you know one thing's for sure if he had a family he's cutting them thank you hard if he had it you think you're hot be about six eight inches higher and be standing up here throwing arms all over play but if he was the beginning of the creation of God there's got to be a continuation on a part of him that's got to come out if he's going to have a family he can't be alone amen alright so now life 1957 just start with the red and then out of the existence of the father went to logos which was the son which is happening we broke that on the board but remember he wasn't just a light he always was a human being always was a human being now in his development of what seeing him like Moses saw him in a burning bush but bringing it to our revelation that we see now in the end time God never was a cloud oh yeah he was a cloud that cloud hid him that pillar of cloud hid who was in what you think we follow a cloud I follow well you come at the cloud you say well you do follow a cloud I follow what was in the cloud and man follow what was in that cloud which was the theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth into a celestial body in they select your body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word then that theophany was made flesh in the person Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the Trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in that and that's the very way we go plumb back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not a flesh born again not of blood but born again by the spirit and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us and then when we die from this life we go into the body if this earthly body is dissolved we have a theophany to go into a body celestial now let's stop right there because remember we don't believe in this church maybe some other churches believe it but we don't believe that I've got some kind of a soul or some kind of a celestial body hanging up on in the closet like this until I if I were to pass away then then you know whatever dies down here comes and comes in isn't it know you are who you are right here you are who you are right here you don't have a theophany to go to you are if the often your soul is your theophany and like I said it's not just one little spot might be opening if it stepped over like this it scare you to death because I'd be 20 years old but it would be me it wouldn't be bro Kali wouldn't be brother dining it'd be me that's who I am that's my exist it but watch then at the coming of the Lord Jesus this body is picked up from the earth again what salt brother was going to get a new body we are go getting you buddy we're all a new creation right but is this earth going to be destroyed or just going to be burnt over I'm telling you people it'd be really easy for God to just give us a new body but it's not part of redemption that is not part of redemption part of redemption is is that this old man was lost right here this old man was lost God comes and burns inside out he will I exit he enters and then if something happens to this he's going to pick this back up again did Jesus have another body nobody died a new body a man the gardener they taught it with the gardener he done turned back to a young man well you know that's I'll get on that later on then at the coming of the Lord this body is picked up from the earth again and made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever then all the perversion all the things that was in the perversion all goes out of existence all right let's continue reading because I get a hurry number 4 now this is just just to give you a punctuation here on number 4 Hebrews chapter 3 1957 go down to the bottom the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany amen the soul that he gave you is your theophany because remember when he went preached to the what souls that were in Hell they were sold they were in their theophany they just didn't have a glorified anything okay the difference between animal and man God put a soul in the man listen animals are not going to be judged the reason we're judged is because you know right from wrong the dog don't know right from wrong why do you think they keep getting killed on the streets why do you think think that things happen to animals that doesn't happen to man but the greatest thing man that God I told you the greatest love that God could give us is water free choice right if not we would just be we would just be Jesus zombies no we have a free will we have a free choice to choose or not choose we have a free choice even after we're born again to choose and not you brother Brian said runs until the day we pass away we have a choice hey man so we're all on free moral agency but what a love of God to give us a choice what he did is give me a chance there's my chance to get back to where I was before hey man 2 lives we may not get to it today either number five all right look let's just read the read that life that begins not nothing along here but all the way up there eternal life zowie God's own life comes down and dwells in the man and he is eternal with God and can't die that's what the word said just think of it is there to eternal life you couldn't answer that could you there is one eternal life and that is the life of God that's why we don't believe in eternal hell there's no such things in eternal hell hell never was a part of eternal hell was created oh yeah the Bible says you'll burn forever and ever sure there is an eternal judgment though hey man there's an eternal judgment cuz once you're judged it's pretty eternity now you're not going to live from eternity because you'd have to have eternal life see that's to to me that's the great thing that the Prophet came to tell us because let if you have an eternal hell then God's got to be there and listen it would belittle my eternal life what kind of you got to think about that I'm a special guy because God gave me eternal life to live forever and ever never never eternity without a problem he can't give that to them people that turned him down he can't give that's why there's two lifes okay you're going to leave here with one of the other you can't leave here with both of them alright we'll read it in a minute just think of it is there to eternal life you couldn't answer that could there is one eternal life and that's the life of God this other kind of life no matter what it is it's gotten into it and anything that had a beginning has an end but anything that had no beginning has no end and God said he would give us eternal life without beginning we were just made a part of him that's that Genesis 1:26 man and actually the life that's in us wasn't brought here by human nature now he's talking about capital L IFE he ain't about just regular life because regular life was brought here by them right now actually the life that's in us they come in eternal life wasn't brought here by human nature nature give us a spirit but that spirit died and we got the Spirit of God glory to God was gone a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was God up theophany a body and there man was made like that and put over the garden but there was no matter till the soil in the senses then he created man out of the dust of the earth the animal life and then that man that till the soul and the man fell by transgression correctly and God the theophany came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem man so it's nothing you could do you're a sinner to start with you're shaped in iniquity you're born in sin come to the world speaking lives you were born here in this world by sexual desire of your father and mother and you're just as hellbound as you can be a pre plain in it I don't care what you do you might never life still keep every commandment and everything else and you'll go to hell like a Marten to its box but the only way that you ever can live again is to that's the Holy Spirit God's eternal life that's why Jesus said you must be born again that's why the new birth is a new birth of a new life inside of you you got a birth life when you got here that's one life you got a life and it comes from God it comes from God permitted and pure but the property God said was born in sin while we came the wrong way that's what Jesus was telling Nicodemus he said Nicodemus what do you talk about going back to your mother's womb in other words that was the warning it was wrong you must be born from above not in a hospital or by midwives you must be born from above amen what made you what you are in the beginning when the Holy Ghost britta'd over the earth there wasn't nothing but volcanic eruption a little Easter flower come up God said that looks pretty good just keep breathing flowers come up grass comes up trees comes up bird flew out of the dust animals came up a man came up man the highest form now look look let's get let's go to number six we're still not gonna get to where hit the two lines now look but we're going to start right here this the questions and answers 1957 he has a spirit in him a man does when he's born because it's the spirit of nature it's a spirit of the world it's a spirit of the god of this world he has merely an offspring of Adam remember Adams when it sold us out Eve did Adam sold us out and then a tree reproduces itself vegetation reproduces itself animals reproduce themselves humans reproduce themselves they are the byproduct of the original creation get it now now when a man is born he's born with a spirit in him of this world that's the reason he has to be born again for this spirit come from the conception of father and mother which was the sexual conception and absolutely not live forever remember in Adam all die alright so he has got to be born again and before he could do that God had to come down and make a way for him to be born again because he had no way to redeem himself he was without hope we were without hope he was without hope without God without Christ in the world lost and gone there's nothing you can do listen there's nothing to do save yourself like I said last Sunday you can sit there and you can you can make you a list of do's and dont's that's good that's just a good neighbor God don't have a list of do's and dont's he said you must be born again amen to me that makes it simple it would be very not simple if I was to do's and dont's that's what the Catholic Church's do's and dont's everybody do this don't be different and then when we come into message you do this don't do that skirt go be this long you can't cut your hair you can't wear this can't do this can't can't can't can't can't Peter said repent Peter said repent that's our problem we don't repent we'll come sit down in the message pew and we still have that same old devil we had when we brought in we just don't repent but if we repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ with remission he says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which will turn you back to the Bible which will turn you back to that great theophany and you'll do what he tells you to do that to me that's more simple than saying do this and on to that number seven thirsting for life now when God was in theophany which was Christ in the making then that the often he became flesh and dwelt among us then that was to redeem he came from there down through this to redeem this creature give it life and take it back up into the eternal one amen now there's only one eternal life and that lays in God alone and God only has eternal life and we have been privileged to become the sons of God then that word he hears my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life the greek word zoe they're used for god's own the creature that accepts him becomes a part of God and as just as eternal as God is that's right there's no reason for us to doubt that it's God's everlasting Eternal Word and everything that had a beginning has an end so what where did sin begin sin began in the Garden of Eden and sin has an end thank God so if David cried o Lord my God my soul is thirsting for the in the dry land where no water is for thy loving-kindness is better than me in life there must be two different types of life and there is two types of life we finally going to get to that quote and when a man is born in this world he's nothing but a product of sin when he's born because he's from sexual desire he's just a product of sin the Bible says so he's born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies and yet he's got life but that life is a perverted life now you see you have to stop hearing you got to take that onion feeling you got to go through your your Holy Ghost filter because God didn't give you a perverted life he gave you life you decide whether it stays that way or not because remember there's a Adamic nature attached to you and that's what that's what keeps you the way you are born in sin shaping an iniquity and all these things but there's a way out Satan cannot create life he can only pervert what God has created Satan has no way there's only one creator and that's God putting Satan can't heal medicine can't heal there's nothing else can heal but God because he's the only creator and anybody that's intelligent with know enough to know that there is not a medicine or a drug or nothing in the world that can create life God is the only solemn one can in creation alone for he said I am the Lord that healeth all thy diseases now look this right here we may stop around here just for time I don't want to take too much time now we see the different types of life listen this that's the reason that this man born as a product of Adam which was a product of sin from listening to his wife and the wife was a product of sin come from Satan now she didn't come from Satan she accepted Satan's lie everybody got that okay I knew you did you know some some don't and Adam followed his wife out a perfect type of Christ going with his de bribe to take her sins as Adam took the sins of even left the Garden of Eden not deceived but willingly walked out with her so was Christ not to see Satan could not deceive him if thou be the Son of God he knew that he was but he deliberately walked out into sin for the church he's our sin bearer and now everything that come out of that cycle of eternal life when that goes back into its cycle again into that ceaseless eternity look at this not one shape form of sin in any way will ever enter now here's one baptist preacher that believes in holiness notice that has got to be cleansed that person cannot person's got to be cleanse and there's only one thing that can cleanse them that's the blood of Jesus Christ nothing else can do it nothing else everybody got that saying man let's skip down to number 10 brother Joe let's let's skip a little bit number 10 go to number 10 questions and answers on Hebrews watch a little old baby not over higher than that just get so mad he'll just wring his hands turn red in the face and hold his breath I've seen some adults do that sure what is it is his nature he got it from his Pappy or his mammy one she had enough temper to fight a buzzsaw or his daddy if they didn't his grandfather grandmother did see its offspring so that makes you're born in the world you came by nature and your whole being is black and smutty and damned and cursed and going to hell amen that's right but when you're born again then the light of God shines down into that soul hallelujah then it's no more a dark Valley but it's a valley with a shadow in it amen you may be veiled here with the flashing with the things known by faith but there's enough light in there and someday that light in darkness has to separate and when the light shines darkness flees and when we go to be with Christ in that body darkness and death vanishes and we burst out into the perfect light glory to God there you are no more sickness no more dark mixed with it all right let's read the next number eleven then we'll make a few comments we'll stop right here and will we finish this next Sunday what do we do well my dear sainted brother dear Saint his sister before the foundation of the world when God created you in His image or created the man in His image and created the woman in His image for the man for the glory of the man he made you a theophany just like himself now look this I'm taking your now back because we're going to go back and I'm going to bring you back to the present day all right when he said led us to the creatures that he had made let us make man in our own image a theophany God had never become flesh yet he was in a theophany all right let's stop right there so what did it he made you a theophany just like himself you think well now brother bottom saying well now we were all a bunch of theophanies no now we're made in the image of that man we were preserved in him we were selected by what I have always said you know we believe in election I believe in election you believe in election right man told me one time a brother Larry he said he said you know what election is he said you got a vote he said God voted for you Satan voted against you you swing the boat and man it's going to be two-to-one one way or the other so there's to me his election Got News what you would do he always wanted to save you Satan always wanted to kill you but then he put this all down in free moral agency but that Genesis 1:26 man let's do this real quick cuz we got communion in the tale that Genesis 1:26 man is so important listen to what he does I want to read this the last one brother Joe if you got if you want to pull that one up that we looked at including this is in 1951 listen to this because I don't think we realize what the new Burke does for us and you may have it and not realize what it's doing for you but when I got it I realize what it did for me because I was telling them downstairs and listen we have an open Communion that's fine we do but the Bible says if you take that communion and you have problems and things in your life if you're not a born-again Christian you should never take communion I'm talking about born-again I'm talking about and here we go with a lift no smoking drinking cussing running around you you understand one time but you got to know inside yourself that you're not doing that you got to know inside yourself that that's not a part of you anymore because watch this right here watch this we know we were born with a nature contrary to God right I just told you that right we were born with a nature that was attached to our soul our theophany on who we are it made me do things that I shouldn't be doing oh y'all didn't oh well I don't need to preach in the morning if y'all maybe I'm just for me we all had problems alright I love this I was just I was looking for something the other day and saw this but watch roll it down just just now looks like it was a fire now watch he's coming back the pillar fire now looks like there you go now looks like if it was fire it would have scorched the bush or burned it now here let me tell you something before you read that look back over at me brother Brian said you could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and don't go to hell why you never had that old nature burn off in your soul right what but it was a supernatural fire who could burn the bush and yet it would still be there amen I'm thankful tonight for a supernatural the Holy Spirit God's flame of fire who could come down into the human heart not not this human heart not this you know your being who you are burn out all the sin unbelief don't harm the person but it purges him makes him grow greater be stronger more faith and he comes tonight in that way listen he can come down into a human body drive out the power of cancer tumor cataract tuberculosis with fire heavenly Holy Spirit fire falling from God out of heaven while my box no mystery if he can burn in bread sent out how much more can he burn cancer out by the same Holy Ghost we've got witness on both sides watching a harlot walking on the street immoral hardly maybe a decent person to look at the Holy Spirit can take that same woman and make a saint out of her took the desire of sin I love that brother branham own when he says in bread twice and one of them's right here he said if he can take him in bread what your natural life the sin that taxi or natural because remember you don't em breathe in God we're bred from one man King theophany he's talking about our old inbred what we have down here this life if he can what if he can burn inbred sin out how much more can you burn cancer out by the same Holy Spirit there's your new birth that's when it goes down into your soul and your being changes don't tell me you can do what you used to do and still have the holy go sure we have problem sure we have things in life but what happens if we're still doing the little things like Genesis 1:26 man doesn't just he just doesn't take the fire burn it out he puts a new man in there he puts a new life that means you're a born-again you started a new born baby in Christ desiring the sin sell milk of the word now like milk I loved it when I was a baby I like beans and potatoes but now I like me so we got to grow up in God the man but that's what my Holy Ghost done for me because if you still got inbred sin you don't have God in there so that's our problem to start with is the Embree ting down here the carnal mind and all the things but when he burns that out and puts the Holy Ghost inside then guess what you are you are privileged to take the communion it is an honor to be able to protect a communion you say well I got this I got this I got this if God gives you opportunity to make it right you need to make a run because when you come to take a communion it says that you would even you would even die if you took it wrong you would even die if you took it wrong so if you don't know that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul and that Umbridge sin that your mom and daddy gave you by nature if that's not burn out of you and you still doing some things like brother Dale said and I agree 100% who you think you're getting away with by doing these things in the closet or doing these things at your home how do you think you getting by with that oh the preacher don't see me well the Holy Ghost does if you'll let him burn that out you won't do it any more things I used to do I'd do them tomorrow amen that to me it's why this church stands that if we can get everybody born again you don't have to preach hair and dress you don't have to preach you got to come to church you don't have to preach and I don't mean it's a waste of time but it's a waste of time why is it you say it's a waste time yeah you can get a sister born-again she's just going to go home and do it hide put a little less on cut a little this hair right if you ever get her born again I don't have to worry about Jim now sometimes you have to look at their clothes all of us have to look the clothes some of you men need to do that yourself look at your sisters and go honey you can't see what I see from back here but that's a little tight that's encouragement but I don't have to tell you now say now you'll cut your hair today they need my pair of scissors in my bathroom I don't think see what I mean I don't have to worry about that why this Jesus that bother you that if you took a pair of scissors and laid them right next to your long hair you know what they would be nothing and Jenny's Scoggins soul that would reach and get them scissors and go to hell right why because that inbred part that says well it's okay to do that it's alright just trim a little here just put the loan here you get that inbred sin burn out I promise you I'll promise you because remember the things I used to do I know I did them and I liked it I don't do them no more because I don't like them anymore I see the results and God forbid if he's going to come down die for me go back up come back and burn this old thing out put him inside why would I want to do anything else why would I want to and listen we make mistakes obviously we all make mistakes but God forgive me real quick God forgive me forgive me for thinking that but you ain't got to worry I'm you know man josh is going to go build a a playhouse for denim kids did you know if you were all standing around there if I hit my finger now you wouldn't hear me say something that you wouldn't want me to say why cuz it's not fair anymore don't think that I'm not gonna think it we can't help the birds they fly overhead but used to there was nothing to stop it to come from here to here but now that that inbred parts been burnt out that old Adamic nature that old nature we used to have it's dead it's dead what our problem is is we just move it over when the preachers here and then we open the closet and bring it back out when he leaves you know what the property guards did he says you can't even divorce it he said it's got to be dead you can't marry another man sisters unless your first husband is dead you can't marry Jesus Christ until your first husband is dead he's got to be DEA D dead by the fire of God you can't kill it but by the fire God he can a man let's stand to our feet the full effect of the fall what was the full of back to the fall to get God down here so he can reveal itself and take us back he didn't leave us he went like he sent us out in the spaceship and said whoops we got a problem guys oh let's just keep letting too long no he said we got a problem and I'm going to fix it I said I'm going to fix it because those are my children what would we not do for our own kids we'd give our life for own kids and that's exactly what it did at Calvary He gave His life so that we can have eternal life and that we can even if we have to pass away we're not dead I died in Christ 15 years at 16 years ago sister Clete has been dead for years right that all nature once you get on that once it's dead it's dead she's a new creature or a new creation in Christ Jesus that's our problem I don't think we really see what that new birth does to us if it does we wouldn't act sometimes by the way we do so let's bow our heads the Lord Jesus we delivered what we think was your word to the people now I pray that it would burn deep into their soul as we come to this time of taking communion the Bible does tell us that there's weak and sickly among us and many sleep because we don't take the communion with all that inbred sin burn out Lord we stand here today no one did you're president you're not somewhere else you're right here we pray that as we continue in and get ready to protect this communion that you would change lives forgive me of my sins in my faults Lauren forgive me other mistakes that I make and sometimes the dilatory attitude that I have towards you that I do other things instead of studying or praying or doing the things I should be doing for you Lord just forgive me of that pray this you just deal with us now this is a solemn time this should not be taken lightly it should be taken with reverence you said you would never you would not drink of this fruit of the vine or eat with us until we come into the kingdom here we are getting close Lord and today we've come to a time for we're going to as we say as humans simulate the body and blood of you that died at Calvary but I know what it does to me every month it reminds me to check out it reminds me to look in that mirror and look and see if I've done anything wrong lord I ask you to forgive me I ask you to forgive the people here Lord with anything wrong Lord if they need the baptism of the Holy Ghost just come in and burn them out give them a good killing Lord because truly truly that's what you want to do you want to do that you want to give us eternal life more than we want it and that's sad that some will turn it down but glorious that others will partake of it and come into this life eternal come into this family of God this Genesis 1:26 man that will live on when all when all the bill gates and when all the rich men of the world are dead and gone monies burn up like ash we'll be walking on the streets of gold never to die again never to be sick again never to have a bad thought or a bad headache never to have trials and tribulations of this life and Lord I believe even now that sometimes you do raise us up into a place to where we can sometimes feel a little that feel your presence know that eternity is not somewhere that we have to go up to heaven to get you brought eternity right down here you walked on this earth in these dimensions with eternal life and you said you would not leave us or forsake us that you would come back and that you would not only be with us but you would be in us till the end of the age and then we're going to come back down here and live for an eternity Father I pray that you'd be with each one we

have to come up here and have your hands laid oh no you just believe in what God's already done believe in what you're doing believe this is not a formality this is to me it's not a formality every month we got to take communion no you know what it does it keeps you checked up it keeps you checked up and it keeps what it keeps the worshiper clean it keeps us clean and then you're listening only

had a hunt in November so that would have been the last time we were seen it was in March because it would have been so many months after that brother Dale give him a prayer cloth told him what it was he agreed what it was put the thing in his pocket for nine years he would walk up during the hunting he'd go I still got that prayer cloth in my nine years the doctors give him three months the swelling went down sure they put him on some hormone therapy and they did something they didn't understand he said he said Sam he said he says they don't understand what happened and that's okay

believe the word leave the word is true it is forever settled in heaven amen what a great testimonies that can be given by mankind and the things about a great eternal God because he's real and he's great a man till wait how much you appreciate the message he's like turning your scriptures turned to 1st Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is in your Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body this caused me our weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this scripture but when we are judged guilty with repent or things done but when we are judged we are chastened rough-cut we're children of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world or for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hungry let him eat at home that you come out together unto condemnation the rest I said in order when I could the Bible says if we tarry one for another let's just take a few moments of silent prayer praying one for the other for go into the communion whether we just thank you for an opportunity we've been able to set today and your testimony is told about you and hear your word ministered unto us that we could believe it and say thank you we love you and we thank you for everything you've done for us and just have your way with us most of all forgive our sins and make us worthy to take of this communion because we know where it's nothing none of us is worthy of any time yet you took my place and that would make me worthy we thank you Father have your way we committed all to you now in Jesus name Amen the Bible said he took the bread and blessed it well then we thank you for this bread is made for this purpose Lord we just follow the end the rules of what we believe and break it in this take the communion knowing the bread is not your body but it cymbals wine is not your blood but in simple yet we do these things until you come because you told us to we live in rethinking sanctify the bread and the protectors in Jesus name his body was broken for each one of us the bread he gave that night Natural Bridge but he told to tell you this is a New Testament in my blood we would literal it was spiritual what about a spiritual happening it has such a reality to it and built we're even still to this day enjoying the fact that we can take the communion and have a understanding of what it means what they pledged great opportunity to know the truth we know that it's not like we used to do use the father is used to keep it three months later we just take it out and throw it out using it in that wasn't scriptural think you don't do it that way it's got to be burned before the next day father we thank you for this line has gone through the process of aging and gets better each day it represents your blood that was shed for each one of us we love you as we thanking we ask you to sanctify the wine and therefore takers that we may all be together as one in you nor did we eat a little piece of bread and we drank a little supper wine tomorrow that will be blood cells in our body but we thank you for that we love you and we just committed to you energy system I know it was a blood I know it was a blur I know it was the blood for me one day when I was long we he died upon the cross and I know it was the blood it was Emmanuel flood but it was he Manuel's fly it was he Manuel's blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was a blood for me I know it was blood I know it was the blood I know it was sublime for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross and I know it was supply for me who paid the price it was Emanuel's blood it was the manual blood it was he manual stuff for me one day when I was lost he died upon the ground and I know it was a blood or me what about an opportunity to be able to believe God's Word to walk in it as he gave it into us the great time and great opportunity to be able to believe it and to thank God for it to accept him for whatever we have need of we believe it don't cut is all taking place in him for about a day in a time that we would know the truth did you ever think that back when we're in the ideas of mankind that we'd ever be able to know the real truth we wondered about it and thought about it was seeing that we can believe it it finishes up with the truth you know why because it started with the truth the solver tape again you can be seated for a second we get everything ready to go he's like turning your scripture turn into John 13 google reader scripture because we believe in fulfilling the word and following it you see a lot of people would take the communion part but it wouldn't take the foot washing well now they even had people to say well you know if you need your feet water I'll wash them but I just don't think it's necessary I said well you just ain't honorable I see any dead yet he was dead you would not worry about washing somebody's feet it would be finished did everybody get okay so he like turning these scriptures we get to John 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from suffering laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded in company to silent Peter and Peter said unto him see look up here gets to his own point is on Sam Lord this I wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what I dude I know it's not now but I shall know Hereafter Peter's happened to him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if I wash thee not die it's no part with me Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my feet only also my hands in the head jesus said unto Him he that is worse neither us not saved to wash his feet but it's clean everywhere and you're clean but not all persecutors were still right there you know he knew it he knew who should betray him darfur said he you're an hour all clean so after he had washed her feet and then taken his garments from set again he said unto them no you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord you say well for Who I am if I then Lord if I then if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord may be he that is sent greater than he that sent him know you if you know these things happy are ye if you do them to stand together be dismayed sisters we'll be going down stars for the foot Martian then make sure each I wait how much you appreciate the message the only father we thank you for this day and the opportunity to be able to come and fellowship together around your word and then now come into the communion and foot-washing time that we Lord look to you the author and finisher of all things we love you and we think and we commit it now in Jesus name Amen you're dismissed the lady's going down
