========================================

God bless you this morning we've been looking at Hebrews 11 faith and uh kind of studying this out let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we dive into our lesson Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord I pray Lord that you'll bless our gathering we know Lord we've got a promise laying there in your word that we're the twos and threes are gathered together you'll be in our midst and we just ask Lord that you'll Quicken the word that we hear today Lord and we study these things out Lord that you'll help us to give us understanding we pray in your name amen so verse one says just uh uh remember last time we kind of ran out of time and you know sometimes I apologize for going so fast I'm going to try to slow down a little bit I I get I get Speedy like Speedy Gonzalez from the The Bugs Bunny and Tweety show but we'll try to just slow down and meditate on on some things um and just kind of back up a little bit now ver verse one says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtained a good report I just want to mention real quick too if you hadn't listened to brother Ryan Sunday School list on on faith you know when we were down there in Nicaragua um I got a chance to just go back and and listen again and catch up and and that I just really appreciate that U his little lesson on faith and uh for by the Elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were are seen were not made of things which do appear and in verse four it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh yet yet speaketh now you know really really one of the reasons I just kind of wanted to just meditate on each of these things these these little stories is because it really drives the point home of what what is Faith and you think about the condition that Abel and Cain and Adam and Eve and all them were in uh even the story of AD Adam and Eve uh that God told them multiply and replenish the Earth well it wasn't quite revealed how that was going to happen just wait and hold on wait for God to reveal it and if you go on and try to try to force it and try to figure things out then you get everything messed up and see that's exactly the same story that was repeated with Cain he tried to figure it out with his own mental understanding even though he'd been taught by his mother and father and and all the he had like the history and everything but yeah he the difference is your Revelation and the Revelation is when God comes and and and uh uh as as will he he he takes the veil off of it and reveals to you the the essence of the thing and brother R said in the maniac of gdar he said Abel had a revelation we're letting that soak just a minute it was a revelation that Abel had that made him just he had a revelation of the requirement of almighty God and he brought a lamb and that's the only way that you'll ever be able to see Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by Revelation that's the only way you'll really be able to really be able to see uh anything that God wants you to see you you know even I I I think you know sometimes God just wants us to take take the Bible open and just set it down maybe in the evening and just meditate on on these stories like maybe think about how the the devil told his lie and their eyes were open and you you see there's these parallels that God wants to open your eyes and the devil's trying to open your eyes to to his to his lies and his his deception but God wants to open your eyes to the truth and you see when when you begin to just sit and and meditate on these things and think over just think about it like uh get a get get a scripture laying there in front of you and just think about what it means and let God begin to speak to you then God will reveal it to you and see there's the the the Revelation is something that's um it's the it's the uh like like look at Abel there how how am I going to get back to God and and you can see have all the all the uh the education laying there in black and white on a page that you could read about but the Revelation was what to do what I need is blood is life that that I was born wrong and you see when God begins to reveal to you that you were born wrong and you need a Redeemer and how to get back it's it's something something is coming off of the page it's it's it's something that's alive and real it becomes real to you and that's the only way you'll ever be able to see your Divine Healing your salvation the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Capstone anything that we're talking about the only you you've got to have Revelation and see what I'm getting at is revelation trumps Revelation goes beyond just being taught about something Revelation goes beyond just having having it laid there in black and white where you just kind of know it in your head but Revelation comes the only one that can give Revelation is God himself so what is revelation is like a like somebody taking a a a a covering off of a statue brother R would use that example A lot of times cuz now now now what was obscured now you can see the thing now you see like like Abel there and how am I going to get back well it was obscured Eve how am I going to how am I going to uh multiply bline replenish the Earth it was obscured it was covered over but when the cover is pulled off then you can see the essence of the thing so Revelation is the act of revealing or disclosing the dictionary definition something God's disclosure of himself and his will to his creatures you see that's what Revelation is all about that God what what really what is the evidence of the new birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you what what is the whole thing is God revealing himself to you and revealing as as part of that his will and revealing when he as he reveals himself then you're part in that so he's revealing you also cuz you're part so all of it is revealing himself to you so if we go back to uh in in verse three it says in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fact thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering but unto Cain unto his offering he had not and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell now you see you you start look open up open up your Bible and just lay it flat on the on the bed at night and just look at those things why think about and I'm trying to encourage you to just meditate get along with God at night and and or in the morning and think about these things why did God respect Abel why does God respect me does God respect what I'm doing why did God not respect Cain what's the difference here cuz Cain was religious Cain was he was coming to church and you would say paying his tithes and and doing all the things that a good churchgoer was going would do what's the difference what's the difference and see the difference is revelation the difference is Faith and brother R said now look at Cain in the Garden of Eden Cain when he come back to Eden he was just as religious as he could be he brought flowers and so forth and put them on the altar he brought the fruits of the the field and laid them down he believed in God he worshiped God he sacrificed to God he built a church to God just as religious as he could be and Abel rolled him up a rock and made him a church or worship Place see the difference is in your heart not by intellectual by by his heart God wants you to Worship in spirit and in truth a quickened revelation of of God of the person of Jesus Christ and his will to you oh you see when you begin enter into to Revelation then you know why you're coming to church it becomes more than just kind of going through some works and things so you're you're not just coming to church just to sit there you're you're you're it it it's it's something real to you you see God wants us to fall in love with him that's what Revelation is about you see now now um we I I'm kind of uh you know when you study at the message what brother R talked about educ ation he he really hammered on education and Theology and Creeds cuz that's really what the essence of this story is Cain and Abel sitting there at the feet of Adam and Eve they they learned all about all about what happened in the garden and then leaving with the surely surely they told them the stories of them leaving with the blood dripping off of their side and and the uh what happened you know not maybe not all the details and everything but they had a good education about that they they used used to they they they used to be able to speak to the wind and the waves and and it would stop and now something happened and Moses down in Egypt he had a good education at his mama's feet where he she told him he was going to be a deliverer and Moses even tried by that educ by his theology he tried to just be a deliverer by killing the Egyptian well I'm going to be a deliverer but it wouldn't work until God revealed it to him you see see there's a difference between Moses sitting at his mama's feet and Moses at the pillar of fire something changed when he got in front of the pillar of fire when God spoke to him and revealed to him his purpose then there was a difference the children of Israel in the wilderness wandering around they they you know they continuously being preached at you can go into the promised land you can overtake the enemy but yet they didn't believe they didn't enter into by faith only two only two one in a million PA all Paul's years with Gia where he sat at the feet of Gia and still he failed to recognize that that all those scripture Those Old Testament scriptures were fulfilled in Jesus Christ see there's the difference between education and Revelation when finally he saw that light and it was and and then the prophet prayed over him and the scales came over his off from his eyes and it was revealed to him all all those things that he had been taught he had been educated for a long time but then then the Revelation struck and and it was revealed to him just like all the disciples that stayed with Jesus for three and a half years and listened to him preach and preach and preach to them but yet they couldn't answer the question like how how are we supposed to be baptized until the day of Pentecost when Revelation struck and they come out of they come out of the upper room preaching that we we'll tell you how to get born again cuz they had a revelation see there's the difference between education and Revelation you see we're not we don't come to church so much to get with education is part of it like maybe even the Sunday School lesson is good education but when you're sitting here and then just something you begin to meditate on in the choir of your room and you begin to think on God and some God begins to move and and then it see it's not the preacher that's giving you the Revelation but it's God speaking to your heart and opening up something to you and you see see that's what that's the thing that gives you power that's the thing that gives you overcoming power is when God gives you a revelation like he gave to Abel like he gave to Enoch that allowed him to escape the bonds of the earth like he gave to Rahab Rahab had a revelation that she knew she had confidence in that little Scarlet thread hung outside her window and that trumped all the education that she might have had by the spies telling her all the all kind of things about this and that and the history of the tribes going through the Wilderness and all that she knew cuz God she had a revelation from God and she had confidence in that oh you see you see what that Paul is all all through the book of Hebrews he's been laying a foundation to to get us to a place where we trust what God Said cuz he wants us to trust him and when we don't trust what God Said like a bride was married to a man and she goes looking at another man because because she lose confidence in her husband that's the problem that's the problem that happen that that's that started in the Garden of Eden when Eve goes to looking at something else and you know we we kind of stopped in the last Sunday school lesson we're looking at at serpent seed because there's the pro the problem is is adultery and I I really want to I don't know if we'll have time to get into it but I went and I I studied out what the what the what the Israelites really believe about serpent seed and if you if you go back in history you'll find out that this ain't just some weird thing that we believe but it's actually what the Israelites believed all the way all the way from the beginning and I've got tons of quotes and things from the uh talmood and from the um uh an all these ancient sources that this is what they believed from the beginning and so God gave us a prophet in this last day to take us back to the original Faith to take us back to what they originally believed from the beginning now I got off my notes a little bit but that's where I'm going so I'm I I said that to kind of keep everybody [Laughter] away education education you see you can you can learn a lot of books of the Bible you can memorize scripture you can memorize all these stories but you can try to connect all the dots on your own but God when God gives you a revelation it's him connecting the dots and putting it together into a perfect understanding you see when you try to when you try to figure it out you miss you miss the go let me I'm just going to look at this now I I I'm just kind of hammering on education he said and and Moses when brother R preached on Moses he said more simple you can get the more humble and get away from yourself your own ideas just take God's word for what it's worth and believe it and it's by faith that these things are come not what you can figure out you'll never be able oh that that that should give us I I think it should give us confidence when you start when you stumble over maybe weighty doctrines and things just wait don't don't do like Eve and try to rush into it and try to figure just because you mess it all up and you see you look down through history and you can see so many people that have just got it messed all up because they they tried to hurry and figure it out and and boom all that all of a sudden they ran into like a seventh ther Doctrine where now they got some man that you got to go follow or or um you get all stumbled over over a weighty Doctrine and they just can't figure it out so now all of a sudden they're going and preaching politics or preaching on that uh things that don't really matter like dinosaurs and whether or not there were dinosaurs on the ark and you know maybe they were but that don't matter you know just you know you you don't don't try to force it and figure it out just wait on the Lord he said there's never been a man on the world on the world no saint nor no one has ever figured God out you can't so don't think that you can do something that they cannot do CU that's right you just believe him that's what he wants you to do not try to figure him out just believe him you you see how simple simple is that a Abel versus Cain Cain trying to have something that looks all polished up and stained glass windows and incense swinging on from some thing in the church and goldplated stuff and that's Cain but Abel was just a little Shepherd on the hillside David little Shepherd on the hillside that all of his family looked at him and said well I wouldn't I wouldn't anoint him to be king look at him he ain't nothing but that's what God wants God wants somebody that can just get down to where you can he can speak to you like I like I was saying in the quiet of your and the quiet of your prayer closet that God can come down and give you a revelation that no man can give you that only God can give you and God's provided a way of approach to Fellowship brother R said I'm not trying to support ignorance but I'm trying to say this that education has it's been one of the greatest hindrance that religion of Christ has ever had people are taking and using their schools of theology to try to educate people for well speaking and how to present themselves and so forth and they go Plum away from the spirit God is not known by education God is not known by denomination God is not known by Creed God is known by faith and that alone it's by faith are we saved God is known by faith so just get as low as you can get get just real humble like a little child that Jesus said that's the kind of person God wants us to be is just like a little child that can just take God at his word and wait for him to reveal it trust him and just stay right with the word and not try to force it not try to figure it out not try to jump to some weird conclusion there's been enough weird stuff he said and God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same he said see he done it with his own wisdom Cain he done it by his own thoughts and that's what it is today they do it by their own wisdom by their schooling by their education and ethics that they have learned but Able by Revelation by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice nothing clean about it as far as it looked humanly speaking the little fell and grabbing him by the neck and wrapped a Vine around him like that and pulled him along to his altar there was nothing so beautiful about it laying him up upon the Altar and hacking his little throat with a sharp throat sharp rock until his blood F flying all over him him bleeding dying it was a horrible sight see to it it was simple though in Simplicity he know that he was born of his mother and father's blood born in his mother's Blood by his father's blood and it was blood that caused the fall so so it was blood that would take it back so he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice cuz it was revealed to him let me see excuse me a second I'm going to jump through some of these try to get to my point so in verse 27 and 28 it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it now see there's god making a promise he made a promise to Adam and Eve and see Eve's problem was he didn't just wait just wait for God to come and interpret that promise wait for him to come and F and and reveal it what what we're supposed to be doing there's our problem we just failed to wait and in Genesis 2:1 16 it says and the Lord God commanded a man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so now we we know the story we've got we've got uh two trees here in the garden and and these trees are are are people there's two trees and you can eat from you eat from One Tree you're going to get life you eat from the other tree and you're going to die oh you see you start meditating on these script that's that's my problem here this this right now you start meditating on these things and all these thoughts what does it mean to die what did did they die all all these things we got to stay on track but you if you sit there and meditate meditate in the steel of the evening then God will begin to open up these things to you and reveal it to you and when in Genesis 3:6 when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did it now I got these little pictures up here CU we we know I think most of us here know the true story of this it's it's kind of funny to think of you know how most of the world pictures it like a snake with a little apple but now if you eat an apple it's not going to an Apple's not going to open up your eyes and the eyes of them both were open and they knew all of a sudden they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves apron you see it wasn't an apple that they ate brother R said in the serpent seed message he said and and see where I'm going with this I'm going to prove to you that this is just not something that that some strange doctrine that just appeared out of nowhere or something he said what was the seed of the serpent adultery you follow it adultery with Eve what happened to that what brought that forth what is it denight and you know Jeremiah in chapter 3 it says Jeremiah talking to Israel he said thou has played the Harlot with many lovers now Israel Israel Israel's playing a harlot but she's not doing it natural so we're talking about spiritual adultery to look at something other than the God's God's made a promise God's proved his promise he come down and proved it and if we if we if we're married to Christ and we start looking at something else it's committing spiritual adultery he said lift up Jeremiah said lift up thine eyes Under the high places and see where thou Hast not been laying with and the wayed hast thou set for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou H has polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness there's Israel supposed to be married to Christ and going off and and and and and flirting with idolatry and all of those strange gods that after God had brought them through the Wilderness and and yet they're and done all these great things and and yet they're cavorting with with all that stuff so there's spiritual adultery and natural adultery brother R said I just got some quotes here where brother R said some things about spiritual adultery he said that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you know him better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take in a lie of the devil against the word of God and another place he said taking the Creeds of man out here as man's Creeds and accepting them instead of the word that's committing spiritual adultery against God in another place he said no denomination could put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away from it you're dead hybrid right there she's back here this testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornications committing in Sp spiritual adultery against the very word that she claims to believe see so God God has given us his promises he's given us his word if you deviate off of that you're doing exact you see oh you see one word off brought death What will what will the full restored word that's why God had to give us a prophet to take us back to bring life back to us and natural brother said all these things about natural ad adultery he said let me tell you something sister dear you're going to answer I don't care you might be as pure as a lily you may never actually commit a sin of that type immoral sin in your life but if you dress like that you're going to answer at the Judgment for committing adultery with every man that looked at you the Bible said and walk down the street who is guilty the man no you no sir you are you presented yourself that way in another place he said the devil cannot create he perverts what has been created what is an adultery and adultery is the right act perverted what is a lie it's the truth perverted and you see how that goes all the way back to the Garden that God had a plan in place and the devil came and perverted that plan and so to lie and that lie put called put Eve into a place where first she committed spiritual adultery and then it turned into natural adultery because how does adultery start adultery starts by somebody's telling you something that's wrong and you receive rece that in the womb of your mind first it starts in the womb of your mind and then it progressed in Eve's case to the womb her natural womb it starts with somebody telling you something and you say that's a great idea somebody tells you uh you see you see why there's that that that promise in Revelation that if you add something to it or take something to it you're you've got those curses because you you're adding to what you're you're messing up the promise of God to cause somebody to to to to stray away from God's word so in Genesis chapter verse 14 it says and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly that shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now so you can see I just and I'm I'm we're going to sit on this for a while so I know I'm kind of going fast a little bit but it it's all right there's two there's two seeds there's the seed of Christ the woman's seed the woman's seed and and the serpent seed so the Serpent's got a seed so now let's back up a second and just see what the Israelites used to say about this now you can read in John chapter 8 that when Jesus was speaking to the to the Israelites he said he told him I speak that which I've seen with my father and you do that which you've seen with your father and they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father see they're they're going back to their n Liney genealogy Jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that ha told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the works of your father then then said they unto him we be not born of fornication okay now they're talking about their understanding of what happened in the garden we we're not born of fornication we we didn't come from Cain we have one father even God now if you go back to uh I I I got I found this book online that kind of summarizes what the Jews believe and it's written it's called The Legends of the Jews and it's written by Louie Ginsburg and it says that according to Jewish tradition after the fall of Eve Satan and the guise of the serpent approached her and the fruit of their Union was Cain the ancestor of all the impi generations that were rebellious toward God and Rose up against him Cain's descent from Satan who is the Angel Samuel was revealed in his saric appearance all right so let's keep going in the Proto evangelium of James which is this um there's a lot of these books that were not included in the Bible for different reasons and this is one of them and it says it's this is supposed to be Joseph speaking now you got to take a lot of this stuff with a kind of a grain of salt there there's a reason why they weren't incl included in the Bible but uh the point that I'm trying to trying to share with you is that this thought process was with the the Jews from Antiquity that of what really happened in the Garden of Eden and so this is supposed to be Joseph speaking Joseph uh Mary's husband and he said I received her from the Temple of the Lord God as a virgin but I did not watch over her who has prayed upon her when when he found out Mary was pregnant this is what he's supposed to be saying who has done this wicked deed in my home and defile the virgin has not the entire history of Adam been summed up in me for just as Adam was singing praise to God when the serpent came and found Eve alone and led her astray so too has this now happened to me so in other words he's saying just like that Eve was this the serpent got Eve and and impregnated her now this same story is repeating in me because now I found my little my little wife Mary now she's having a child with some other man is what he thought is what what the story story is tertullian who was this um uh an author in the in the first uh around 150 ad he was a a he wrote a lot of a lot of books on Christianity and things he said you are the deil speaking of women he said women you are the devil's Gateway you are the unsealer of that forbidden tree and I'm sorry we're going to have to stop right there she
