afternoon we got four now being baptized and we and and I'm expecting one more I like four I don't like five I really enjoy I like five five is a wonderful number so uh let's pray for that next one we always give an opportunity for anybody that wants to be baptized to be baptized and usually about once a year we try to u to uh uh teach a little bit on water baptism so we're going to do that today and what the value of a name is all right so um if you got your Bibles turn to the Book of Matthew 28 let me read you a little quote here it says sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory think about that you'll never know the value of a moment until it becomes the memory so live for the moment live for the time that you are now we know who holds the future you just got to know him right so let's let's know the guy that holds the Future Let's don't worry about politics and all that other stuff who cares about that all right so now we're going to go to Matthew 28 start with verse 16 let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for the opportunity that we have to be here today we thank you for your love and Grace we thank you for the group of people that are presented here Lord and also the ones that are watching in Father we pray that you'd be with each one father forgive us of our sins bless the ones that are sick Lord just be with the ones Lord in the Foreign Fields Lord we think about get messages from them all week Lord about what they're doing in the Philippines and different places father I pray that You' just bless them and give them fruit for their labor father I pray today that you give us fruit for our labor today father as we have four being baptized Lord and I pray Lord that you would just come Among Us in a special way as we as we go through this little teaching on water baptism and see that that the world may be blinded to many things because you you stood one day and you said you said Lord you said thank you Father that you've hid these things from the wise improved and revealed them to babes such as would learn we know that the scripture the Bible is not like a newspaper that there's a there's a meaning behind each phrase and each line in that scripture Lord there a love letter to the bride and you only whisper those secrets to her father I pray that you'd be with Lord each one that I said was sick maybe Lord today and Richard I think lord said he had a fever and brother Boyd with a with a headache father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that that before the service is over that those things will be taken away Lord you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so now as we open back your word Lord just bless the speaker bless the hearer father in Jesus name amen Matthew 28:16 now we're going to talk on water baptism today and we're going to use the scripture and let's just see what we can get into um Matthew 28:16 says then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them now the reason it was 11 was What Judas was already he had already hung himself he was he was dead so they were looking for number 12 they only had 11 there so the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted H and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore and teach All Nations now look this is the order go go teach preach baptize all right go teach and baptize that's what Jesus said and I'm tell talking about another man Jesus said this all right go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing in in the name of the father that that's not names that's name name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatso ever I have commanded you and lo I am with you all way praise God even unto the end of the world Amen you may be seated in The Lord At His blessings to reading his word but that word baptism comes from the word baptizo all right our baptized are to immerse are submerged we don't believe in sprinkling we believe that Jesus was baptized because the Bible says when he came up out of the water that that kind of means he was down in the water when he came up out of the water we read that scripture in a minute but I want to show you something here in water baptism we know it's truly important but listen to what um we've read this before but maybe for for Anna's family that this comes out of the Greek Lexicon and this is the Greek word for baptized This Is How They This Is How They tell us what the word baptizo means or is an example of says the clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is a text from the Greek poet and and physician nikander who lived about 200 BC it's a recipe for making pickles you didn't know you going to get a you know you going to get a lesson on making pickles today did you it's a recipe for making pickles and helpful because it uses both words Baptist and baptizo bapto and baptizo nikander says that in order to make a pickle the vegetables should first be dipped bapto into boiling water and then baptized baptizo into the vinegar solution now we're all from the south and we know that's how it happens but remember there's something happens because a pickle was a cucumber at one time am but when it becomes a pickle it don't go back to being a cucumber anymore I hope somebody got something there it changes you both verbs concern the immersing of vegetables in a solution but the first is temporary the second the act of baptizing the vegetable produces a permanent change when used in the New Testament this word more often refers to our Union and identification with Christ than to our water baptism Mark 16:16 he that believes and is baptized shall be saved Christ is saying that mere intellectual asent is not enough there must be a union with him a real change like the vegetable to the pickle and as I said before when we baptize we are absolutely expecting God to kill something yes sir death burial Resurrection all right in other words if it's not then we're just you're just going to be dry and you're going to be wet and you're going to come up out of the water no we expect a change cuz cuz listen cuz that's what God told us to do that's right all right God told us the last thing he told us before he left he said go preach and baptize all right and do this in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost all right so everybody's with me all right so let's look here in Matthew 3:4 to the same John why they call John the Baptist because he baptized people hello and the same John had his rment of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins and his meat was Locust and Wild Honey water died then went out then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the regions around Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins all right so you see this water baptism begins with John immersing in water a group of people all right is everybody with me now let's look at this and see how important water baptism is cuz he had one person come to him that was really very very important all right Matthew 3:1 13 says then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answered and said suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him now in other words in other words he baptized him all right now what Jesus was saying was and if you go back into the Old Testament and remember that in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was getting ready to be put on the Altar and to be SL Lane everybody with me you had to wash it so the sacrifice had to be washed something it had to be washed before it was presented to the priest so that's what Jesus is saying I know I'm the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world cuz you said I was and now the lamb must be washed and he let John baptize him but now something happened during that baptism on and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water that's what I mean he come straight way out of the water he wasn't sprinkled amen and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased God was pleased with the baptismal service we're going to be pleased today God's going to be pleased with the baptismal service today amen so now let's look at this now Jesus told us said go ye therefore now this is God himself this is Jesus all right this is go ye therefore somebody we're supposed to listen to go ye therefore go teach preach baptize in the name now look that it didn't say names cuz I want to ask you a question before we get started if you are a father in this building today raise your hand if you're a father all right put him down son Spirit okay I want you father come up here you one father come up here well which one you going to choose but if I say Aaron Roberts that's a name amen if I say Aaron Roberts everybody in this building that knows him would know that I'm talking about this guy there's a name and then there's something behind that name amen but his name's not father right right it's a title to a name he is a son but he has a name and it's connected and the always be connected he'll never sign a check that says father you'll get it back right we don't we don't write checks anymore so what does it matter y'all are putting me out of business I work for the post office please do something send something through the mail it may take six or eight weeks but please send something hey not my fault we can't hire people to do their job but Jesus gave us a job and we're we're trying to do a job right here okay so go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name yes sir it's father a name no it's not a name no it's Holy Ghost a name now look the name is used for everything which the name covers right everything the thought or feeling of which is aroused in the Mind by mentioning hearing and remembering the name when I say all right I want to talk to Aaron Roberts now everybody that knows him in here knows that he is my brother brother-in-law cuz his brother married my my sister I know that he works for tacky a tacky place he he yeah he knows how to do hbac his wife is Sarah his two kids are Levi and Adam right most of you that know him know that but we know he's a father too cuz he has children we know he's a son cuz we knew his dad and we know his mom and he's a spirit man cuz he's standing there shaking sitting there shaking his head right but that's not his name his name identifies and and what does it do it divides who he is all right so now remember Jesus said in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost so everything which is aroused in the mind in other words the thinking of who he is by mentioning hearing remembering the name for one's rank Authority interest pleasure command Excellence Deeds Etc so when you call somebody's name there's something behind all that all right when you say father that could mean the 25 or 30 people in here that shook raise their hand said they're a father right but there's got to be a name behind it all right your name doesn't just do the job of signaling things about you to other people your name can also be a vital expression of your own individual identity just like I presented right here I don't work for tacky I work for the Post Office my name's way Dale his name's Aaron Roberts we each have a a significance behind the name and there's power behind the name if you say the well let's don't use the president of the United States let's use something else if you say the governor of the state of Georgia well now if you say the current governor you might say it would be whatever his name is cuts his hair but huh that's what I said Brian km but if you say the governor of the state of Georgia and just leave it out there are you talking about him you talking about Joe Frank Harris you talking about all the different ones Jimmy Carter but you you put the you say no I'm talking about Brian km so that's where you present that you say I'm talking about this person right here all right so your name can also be a vital expression of your own individual identity representing a profound con connection to your family now we're going to read scripture that's going to connect to every bit of this everybody with me I'm not just reading this cuz I found it online it must be true Steve because it's off the internet so and I don't do Tik Tock or another that so I worry about representing a profound connection to your family language and Community what is the power behind the name not only can a name connect each of us to our own identity and individuality but it can also carry power Brian km responsibility and blessings right what does the Bible say about the power of names names carried weight and character and were often tied to a person's Destiny now it shows that God changed Abram's name to Abraham because Abram did not mean father of many nations Abraham means father of many nations and God told him he would be the father of Nations is everybody with me Bible readers you know this all right Saul became Paul Saul persecuted the Christians Paul became a Christian so we know that because his name was Saul over here in the Bible right and he persecuted the Christians but now his name is Paul Peter there was a name change when there was something changed in their life amen and listen when we get born again our name is changed to Mrs Jesus Christ we are not born of this world anymore we are born from above you born down here you're going to die that's right but you born from above you'll live you say oh why is the grav full oh don't worry that's just temporary names carried weight and character were off were often tied to a person's Destiny that's why throughout scripture when God was was about to do something new with a person new with a person he would often change the name names carried weight and character and were often tied to a person's Destiny Abram became Abraham let's look in the Bible what the Bible says about a name now here's John 5:43 now this is Jesus talking all right he says I am come in my father's name he didn't say I am coming my father corre he said I'm coming in my father's name and God's not a name that's right amen God's an object of worship it's a title God had a name it was Jesus Christ I am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive right oh so there must be something behind the name the name Jesus Christ got him killed that's right amen Ephesians 3:14 Paul says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is what named we're all now pickles we were born cucumbers now we're pickles cuz we had a change yes 2 Corinthians 11:1 says would to God you could bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me this is Paul for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ amen points you where is going to take you to right amen Zechariah 14:9 says and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth in that day shall there be one Lord and his name one now listen God's name is not o NE e he has a name he has one name that's why Jesus didn't say in the names Jesus stood said baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost all right because there's only one name we're going to read it here in just a minute whereby men are saved and that's Jesus Christ acts 4:1 says be it unto you all be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him do this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was said at not of you Builder this is this is Peter and joh and James talking which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation and any other right for there is none other name amen under Heaven given unto men whereby we must be saved not titles name Ephesians 4:4 there's one body one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling yes one Lord One Faith one baptism all right so there's not two or three baptisms one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all thank God Paul was a southerner in you all Colossians 3:16 Says let the word of the C listen this is Bible yes all right this is Bible am everybody with me all right let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs we were just doing that singing with Grace in heart to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the titles of father [Music] son oh I know what that says watch whatever you doing word or deed do all everybody say all y'all didn't all say all say all say all like George a touch just SC a touchdown that's better do do all in the name of of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him everybody with me all right look at the importance of a name Philippians 2:8 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also ha highly exalted him and given who's this himy who's this him guy this him guy's got a name sir or you could call him Judas but right here he connects it look giving him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father I'm trying to hold it down here who has the keys now let's say I'm ask you a question God Jesus gave the key to somebody that was on Earth all right Matthew 16:18 I've got them here if you want to read them and they'll be on line if you need to see them again but if you're a Bible reader you know this is all Bible and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church now this is Peter right amen and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it look at verse 19 and I who's talking Jesus right will give unto thee Peter the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven if you got the key to something that means you can get in or that means you can lock somebody out and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth what power whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth he said I'm going to honor that and I'm going to bind it in heaven amen but now whatever you loose on Earth whatever you speak whatever you loose in the name of the Lord Jesus I'm going to loose it in heaven amen Peter's a pretty important guy amen so let's look now we come to Matthew 28:19 which Jesus said going to all the world teaching and preaching and baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost now acts two is about 11 or 12 days after Jesus said that and ascended all right and he's give the power and authority to a man named Peter with a set of keys not physically but whatever he said he said whatever you say now here's Acts 2:36 therefore let all the house of Israel know ass surely that God hath made this same Jesus whom you've crucified both Lord and Christ H got it Lord and Christ Christ H now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart they heard a simple message they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter now here's Peter now listen what's Peter got Peter's got keys that the Lord Jesus himself gave to him that's right not another man right then P said unto them repent right and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive look at that promise and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off right here we're far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this untour generation the first step of getting out of this generation is to repent and then be baptized in a name that's right right that's what Peter said Jesus even said that that's right then they that gladly received his word were what baptized they didn't have a problem with it they were baptized 3,000 we're going to do four today could you imagine 3,000 it said the same day they were added under them 3,000 Souls that believed one man's preaching and didn't say now hang on a minute I heard that man 12 days ago say to baptize different no he told you bapt he told you baptize same way Peter said because they can't be contradictory to each other that's right they continued steadfast in the apostles Doctrine in fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayer all right now right here and we won't be long today we'll get ready to get baptized now if you go to this website it's called Apostolic archives International Incorporated it's on the Internet it's got to be true this is true because it it put you right into the scripture so now look baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus now many millions of of converts have been baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost all right right and you're going to hear me say we're going to baptize today in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost to fulfill that scripture we're going to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because that's exactly what it says they're not two different scriptures or you just might as well tear your Bible up and throw it away hello somebody I mean if God can't keep it straight you know me and you can't that's right so how did the early church now this is the early church interpret Christ's command in Matthew 28:19 we're talking about acts 238 acts 8:16 acts 10:48 and acts 19:5 are four biblical references that answer this question I when I was at the Philippine in the Philippines they have a mystery Expo and hundreds of denominational preachers and they're all trinitarians and they're all they all baptized name Father Son and Holy Ghost and they're all sitting in there you know about it was at that day was about 50 something 58 of them I think it was and brother roel God bless his heart when I call his name it just hurts cuz he's passed on you know but he stood up and he said okay he said I got a $10,000 for one of you to bring me a scripture that anybody in the Bible was baptized in titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost right one scripture I'll give you $10,000 I don't know where he got that $10,000 from but I'm so confident i' give you a million I may have to work the rest of my life B from Brother Kylie oh I need to worry okay he says I need to worry but there's nobody there's nobody in scripture ever baptized in those titles that's right not one now let's let's look at the history and this is true history because it's it comes from these encyclopedias that's why I made the encyclopedias a little um highlighted them if the biblical record is not enough please examine the findings of the educated Scholars and historians this is branica encyclopedia 11th Edition volume 3 page 365 baptism was changed from the name of Jesus to words father Son and Holy Ghost in the second century amen you have you have boy and Janice said they have the bratanic encyclopedia that has that in it if you want to read it cany Encyclopedia of religion page 53 said the early church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus until the second century am Hastings Encyclopedia of religion volume two Christian baptism was administered using the words in the name of Jesus page 377 baptism was always in the name of Jesus until the time of Justin Martyr page 389 Catholic encyclopedia oh boy don't read too much into that but you can read this volume two page 263 here the author acknowledges that the baptismal formula was changed by their church right you're baptizing in a Catholic doctrin sha for herzog's religious encyclopedia volume one page 435 the New Testament knows only the baptism in the name of Jesus Hastings dictionary of the Bible page 88 it must be acknowledged that the threefold name of Matthew 28:19 does not appear to have been used by the Primitive church but rather in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ Our Lord Jesus is it an absolute necessity that the name of Jesus be spoken or called over a candidate for what of baptism when he's being baptized for the answer to this question please read Acts 15:17 and James 2:7 first century Christians invoked or called The Name of Jesus over Believers in water baptism if as some Say the Name of Jesus means the authority of Jesus then so much more should the name rather than the titles be called over an individual in baptism read Matthew 28:18 Acts 4:12 Colossians 2:9 Jude 3 is an exhortation to contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints see Galatians 1 89 I kind of didn't go to that to save time cuz I don't want to we're going to have a baptismal service all right now look baptism in Jesus name according to the Bible Jesus taught that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name beginning at Jerusalem Luke 24:47 Peter obeyed and said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins acts 23839 the Samaritans they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus acts 8:16 the Gentiles were commanded he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus acts 10 verse 48 Paul re-baptized a group of people that were baptized unto John all right when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Acts 19 3:5 no other name for salvation there is none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved acts 4 10-12 everything done in Jesus name whatsoever you do in word or inde deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Galatians 3: Colossians 3:1 17 the above scriptures are not given to refute Matthew 28:19 where Jesus told the apostles to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost they merely show how the command was interpreted and obeyed by them the apostles knew what most religious leaders of today fail to recognize first that the Lord Jesus Christ is the family name [Music] Hallelujah that's where I I'm not identified as a Dale anymore come on I'm a Christian yes you're a Christian if you're born again you're a Christian that puts you in heaven the name Dale may be a good name but if you're not born again it'll put you in hell the apostles knew what most religious leaders of today fail to recognize first that the Lord Jesus Christ is a family name Ephesians 3:15 second that the fullness of the godhead deity or God dwelleth bodily in who Christ they knew the name of the son was Jesus Matthew 1: 21 they knew that the son came in the father's name John 5:43 I read that to you they also knew that the Holy Ghost was the spirit of Christ and would come in Jesus name John 14:26 the name Jesus means Jehovah salvation that's in faucets Bible encyclopedia page 359 now I couldn't condemn these so I'm just going to have to read I couldn't get them in a box I'm sorry I'm kind of illiterate when it comes to this stuff but the baptismal formula was changed from the name of Jesus Christ by the Catholic church in the 2 Century I read that everywhere in the oldest sources it states that baptism took place in Jesus name all right Catholic ENC encyclopedia says here the Catholics acknowledge that they changed the baptism they changed it right let's go on down to right here look which of these were practiced by the apostles in the early church below are two columns you see those two columns one's full and one's empty below are two columns for listing the scriptures where the apostles either taught or practiced water baptism in Jesus name I read them to you a minute ago go repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus there's none other name given whereby we must be saved Paul taught whatever you do do all in the name of the Lord Jesus now show me a scripture over there on that side not one my million dollars is safe yes that my wife said Matthew 28:19 was a command by Jesus to baptize in a name all right the apostles did not repeat the words of the command but they did obey it as seen in the scriptures above since Father Son and Holy Ghost are titles of the manifestation of the almighty spirit and his body the apostles understood his saving name to be Jesus amen can any dare say that the apostles disobeyed the Lord are Faith to baptize properly the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ the actions of the Apostles in the book of Acts prove this to be true we'll finish with this and then we'll say a few words and then we'll be done Romans 8 Romans 6:3 we we're going to read that outside know you not that so many of us were baptized what into Jesus Christ one more time Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death that's what identif ifies us a father doesn't identify me my name identifies who I am amen know you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by bapti baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead when we go down and come back up that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so also we should walk in newness of life Colossians 2:1 in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands remember the circumcision in the Bible in the Old Testament was a type of the of the Holy Ghost all right so we don't do that anymore it's not a type you get born again all right and whom also you are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands and putting off of the body of sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism now if you bury now I'm going to depend if I pass away I'm going to depend on somebody to bring me out of the Grave cuz this life is just about that short but there's an eternal one going in that direction everybody with me all right I'm going to depend on that and I am not going to depend on my father to raise me up who you talking about are you talking about Samuel Dale he'll be here in a little while you'll get to see him am I going to be depending on a son what son to raise me from the dead am am I going to depend on the spirit no I'm going to depend on the guy that put put me there with a hope to get back out and his name's the Lord Jesus Christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the now who's him like I say again what we talking about who's him brother Dell preached to us a long time ago he said what if you took every name out of the Bible how in the world could you understand it right read it look in the Bible and just start reading even in Genesis was formed from the dust of the ground and Adam come and what I was saying I said Adam and Eve but that just those that first little two verses you're going who's he talking about but when I say Adam everybody knows who Adam was when I say Eve everybody knows who Eve was when I say I'm going to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know who that person is buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins you can be just as alive and goodlooking as I still can't remember his name as Al and goodlooking as he is but if you're not born again you're dead right but you're alive in Jesus Christ not in a title that'sall title can be many things but when you hone it down to a man named Lord Jesus Christ you know where you come from and you know where you going CU all the family in Heaven and Earth is name Jesus Christ not a title and you being dead in your sins and the uncircum ision of your fles hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses somebody say all all transgressions or trespasses all of them but you got to do it by name that's right listen why does the why does the world say the word Jesus name Jesus Christ and it ain't good that's the devil telling them to do it that's blaspheming the name of God yes yes you've heard them say it they say it all the time that's horrible it's the most precious name ever come off anybody's lip and for them to to desecrate it they deserve hell hello there is a hell that's right and you go in there if you're not baptized not baptized this baptized but baptized by the holy spirit in your soul yes but you need to be baptized to identify who you are amen amen right to identify who you are it is an outward expression I didn't read the Bible but it talks about an outward expression of an inward work that these four are going to show not only just the community that's right but it'll be on the internet so it'll be all over the world that they took a stand Ruth took a stand that's right sister Ruth we've known each other since we were kids she's a lot older than me I mean younger than I am but they know that but we we grew up together we've known each other known a family but that was one day last year can I borrow this sure I'm going borrow it anyway she was outside and she went this is it right right Lord Regina Arline y same way right raise your hand up Regina Arline not her if I said her everybody Regina Arline steak amen amen put it down that's it and I saw a change right Hallelujah they drove it down and said I declare this is it that's right amen I declare this is it we've had people be baptized several several times and that's okay I'll baptize you as many times you want to be baptized but that's a certain time when you got to quit going to the water every Sunday but I will cuz the water's warm but put that state down yes that's it Satan right here this is where I change families this is where I change family I'm not a cucumber anymore I'm a pickle but you'll get me out of a pickle all right I said I was going to calm down we got bsiness but I believe that God told us one way to be baptized amen amen the the the apostles weren't confused used Jesus obviously wasn't confused but he told us to do it in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost the name there's power we sing a song there's power in the name of Jesus there's power what because there's something behind the name there's a life behind the name that's right and your life you know what makes the demons tremble you know what makes Satan tremble not not not not reading the Bible every day it's living that Bible every day Satan can read he can read better than you he he got a church for you did he can read it he's been listen he's been reading that thing since they put it in print the devil ain't an idiot well okay he is but he keeps reading the thing over and over again sees his own demise and don't believe it that's how bad an unbeliever he is but I see he has an end cuz my daddy my daddy said he'll have an end there'll be a lake of fire yeah and listen he won't be be alone that's right right he will not be alone I like what uh brother Brady over in Jamaica you most of us know who he is he's very Frank he was doing a funeral one time and he said and you know how he does like this he said I tell you Way he talk I tell you if old John here didn't repent he's in hell right now somebody called me the other day and asked me about what should they say at a funeral I said daddy always told me that people don't get up and leave funerals until it's over that's right so you got them preach to them preach salvation preach the name of the Lord Jesus to him cuz most of the time they ain't going to get up walk out now they probably got mad at brother Brady family did but he's telling the truth abely that's right Paul says have I made and become your enemy have I made him become your enemy because I told you what the Bible said nothing not another man right right the Bible if we can't believe the Bible let's just eat and drink and be married cuz we're going to all die and we just going to vaporize into nothing right but if I have only hope the Bible says in this life I'm a men most miserable I wouldn't live another day without God in my heart now I did for 20 years I did but that didn't mean God didn't call me but he called me for the last time one day brother Gary I responded you got to respond remember you don't go looking for God that's right right sister Rebecca you don't God comes looking for you and he comes knocking on your door you love the Lord am I do too cuz he gave us a purpose and a plan to be here told us what to do we just got to do it we just got to do it and and you know we can drown oursel in this and that and the other and all this other stuff what is it temporary what I'm telling you today is eternal Eternal see we as human beings we can't understand Eternal cuz you're all looking at your watch now going I wish you quit but there's one day where there's not going to be time there one day when we can sit down by a river with with the most clean water you ever seen in your life not a cloud in the sky Steve you won't be grunting when you get up out of a chair I do I don't know about you but none of my bones will be hurting my teeth will be right where they're supposed to be but that's not true here so you better make your preparation here for there you got to make it here the Bible says whatever way the tree falls or leans that's the way it's going to fall don't depend on dying and then getting right somewhere else you need to get right right here so Peter stands up on the dead of Pentecost and he says what repent yes I pray all four of you have repented for your sin and then you want to go to water baptism right right right repent because when you repent you can put a steak down you say that's it praise God God's got amnesia he can't remember my sins if I confess them to him what a mighty God we serve yeah but you and I don't can't forget it well no we can't but like I said before tragedy does not destroy a Christian it defines who they are look at Job look at Jesus look at all the people went through tragedy we talking about this morning we're talking about tragedy and different things happening that we have to overcome listen this is not a cruise ship this is a battleship amen and we didn't bring knives and forts to this war either we brought swords and shields it's not a picnic am man it's a battle and the first battle is is that when you step out and say God I want to walk with you Satan's going to be going no You're My Greatest Warrior I turned around one day and I said I was am but not now I'm buried you're buried yes sir leave it there leave it there take your burd to the Lord and leave it there when we go in this water leave it there death die burial but thank God for Resurrection let's stand to our feet musicians come we'll sing a song before we go I'll have to change but let's sing a song if anybody needs prayer or or anything the altar is open we'll sing a song and then what we'll do is when we get finished we'll just go out it'll be right out here in the in the playground and I'll go change and I'll come around the back and we'll have our sisters to be baptized if you sisters need other sisters to assist you we have some extra towels um for you if you need them if anybody else wants to be baptized we will make arrangements any way we can that you don't have to go home with wet clothes on we'll do something Dollar General open we'll go buy some clothes I'm serious listen my mama got baptized we going to go to a pool today Anna and we're going to get in this 105 degree pool nice water I chlorin it I put the chemicals in it I tested it today and it says oh it's good my mama was baptized sometime in the winter time in Gainesville on Lake lanir they had to bust the ice to get her in the water they had to bust the ice walked out in there when she was baptized come up out of the pool I mean come up out of the lak ler that there was icicles hanging down on her head she said she never felt cold we drove through Gainesville in the middle of Gainesville there was if you you've been in gamesville that a long time ago the First National Bank always had a fountain well it was a solid sheet of ice that's how cold it was so we tried to make it a little more convenient for you to be baptized but I was baptized in 30 something degree water in January and didn't feel a thing never have we ever had anybody catch a cold because they got baptized in cold water cuz if you'll do it right God will be with you let's sing one song before we dismiss the Mighty
