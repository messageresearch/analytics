continuing to pray for brother royale and the family there in the philippines we we keep hearing gradual better news every day and so so today we had we heard wonderful wonderful news that um he he doesn't have doesn't have blood clots in his lungs which is good and um just a little bit of um bacterial pneumonia so they're trying to use i know antibiotics to to to clear that up so um but he's getting there i believe i believe soon he'll get off that that ventilator that ventilator is not down his throat not down his mouth anymore they got it right straight hooked into his throat now uh forgot the reason why that needed to be done but um so anyways thank you all for those prayers you just continue to remember all the other ones that are struggling and many sick people we know it's nothing but devil nothing but satan attacking his people but at the same time i believe god is is allowing us to be able to uh use this this time to to look at ourselves and to look at our own walks with god amen and to uh as i will be talking here in just a moment you know to about uh looking at at our lives in order to advance this kingdom even further you see because i believe the kingdom is still amen is still advancing it's still growing it's still the kingdom hasn't stopped because of covet the kingdom is still advancing there's people still coming in the holy spirit is still at work and so uh i believe that with all my heart and so these are just signs of of the end time and just a closer time for the come you know for the covenant of the lord so we just thank you all for for those prayers um i believe i don't i don't have anything that i need to announce so uh so we're just gonna go ahead and go to the word and uh we'll do our best to not you i'm trying not to keep you all along tonight so we're going to go to john chapter 15 john chapter 15. now i want to talk this i want to start maybe this this might end up being like a little series um because i don't think i'll be able to get done tonight but um but maybe uh we'll we'll we'll finish it out in a few different services but um this um this this really impressed me the other day well actually yesterday as i was looking looking into this about what the law of christ is and and so we're living in the time saints where where we need to fulfill the law of christ we need to fulfill the law of christ and where the world is trying to divide us amen god is calling for our unity you see the world is trying to divide their own and they're also trying to divide the people of god as well and we know it's nothing but satan yet god even at the end time even towards the end of his ministry where there was even division amen god was trying to bring unity among his people he even prayed for for for his children and for and for even those that those his disciples was going to reach amen and what did he call for for unity amen and satan knows that if if we're not unified and if there's no love amongst one another and if we allow the elements and if we allow the governments and if we allow the media to to to to to divide us then he know he he has us conquered no matter with what with what it is what political thing that they throw at us if it causes division you know it's not of god it's got to be from satan so so we want to we want to look at something here and just and hopefully i hope you receive as much of a blessing from it as i've been receiving because i've been certainly enjoying looking at looking at this so let's look here at john chapter 15 verse verse 8. the bible says herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you and then he says here continue ye in my love now watch if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full verse 12 this is my commandment watch this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you and we'll talk if the lord gives us some time we'll we'll we'll talk about that some more in more detail about something that he did amen that proved that that showed that greater love verse 13 greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends amen you are my friends i hope you can say that to me you are my friends amen if ye do whatsoever i command you jesus says you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you verse 17. now we'll skip down to verse 17. watch these things i command you that ye love one another so it wasn't a suggestion it wasn't as it wasn't you know uh just a thought it was a commandment these things i command you that ye love one another amen now let's look at verse uh galatians chapter 6 verse 2. and we appreciate the brothers because i'm going to do some some reading tonight and i told him i prepared him beforehand that we'll be doing some reading and i hope you pay attention i hope that this is something that that will bless you it says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ amen so let's just bow our heads tonight our gracious lord jesus we come before you once more thanking you for the opportunity that we have to just look back father in your word lord this is this eternal word father this word that was father god spoken lord god and and you being the word lord god eternal father always has been lord god there's never be you had no beginning and father you will have no end and now father god this word lord god abides in your people lord jesus and father god you want to not necessarily lord god for uh for us to just uh be wanderers here in this earth lord god almighty but lord god you want to do a work through us lord god almighty in this hour lord jesus and father god the world will know father god that that we are yours because of the way we treat each other and the way we love one another lord so we ask that you help us father god this evening strengthen us bless each and every one father that is uh sick lord and and father every every person lord god that may be having any issues whether it be health problems or financial problems whatever the issues may be bless them lord be with them father meet these needs father they were mentioned father and we commit them into your hands now we ask you these things now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen lord bless you you may be seated i bring greetings to all the people viewing us online amen i get i get i get messages from from people you know all the time telling us how they enjoy you know the services and how they enjoyed the ministry here and and uh so we just thank god amen because there's people you know watching from beyond the four walls amen and they enjoy the word that comes through amen praise god amen so i want to talk this evening advancing god's kingdom by fulfilling the law of christ amen and i know that each and every one of us has probably heard the phrase uh a new world order amen well the world they have that phrase they they use that phrase politicians and and and and big uh people of this earth who who call this earth their home and this current uh uh uh this current situation that they're in you know call it their home but see god has his own new world order amen and he established that when he was here on earth amen and uh it's been advancing ever since praise god it's it's it's an order that satan can't put can't put his finger on amen it's an eternal order amen their order is something that they think that they're obtaining eternal life by however way they they want to they they look to machines they look to they're trying to find the source of eternal life when we already have eternal life and there's nothing that we had to do we had to create no ai's anything inject ourselves with anything or anything like that amen all we have to do is believe upon what god said in his word amen and we have his eternal life in us amen praise the lord amen so i want to start off this this uh evening with with uh what matthew chapter 24 verse 9 through 14 says and i wan i want to put it i want to look at this here about about the love of many shall wax cold amen when we were listening to uh brother uh brother claude the other day and uh it struck me it struck me that that he mentioned something there when he was talking about this part with regards to uh that the people towards the end time amen there will be a people that will suffer for his namesake and now who who suffers for his namesake well it's either the jews who've accepted christ or it's us that's the gentiles because we're the ones who take his name amen or jews amen there's messianic jews out there who believe that jesus christ is the messiah amen and uh so they they there will there will be a persecution even for them as well but um but in looking at this at this here we we see the different conditions and what's happening here and we're seeing it clearly even now in the end time that we're living in so if we start there in verse 9 it says then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and we're living in that time aren't we because everybody gets offended for everything now you just it's it's snowflakes everywhere you go you can't say one thing anymore you can't joke around anything because you have to be politically correct about everything nowadays so the bible was talking about it and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and we're seeing that and we're not careful amen we'll fall in line to maybe even possibly let in that direction too because who was the one that betrayed jesus it was one of his own it was one that followed him that's who betrayed jesus and shall betray one another and shall hate one another those are strong words and this is jesus speaking verse 11 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many many people amen you you can turn on you can turn on youtube and you can listen to anybody you want to and be deceived amen in verse 12 and because iniquity now watch this and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now it doesn't say that the love shall completely go away but that the love of many not all but many shall dwindle shall get cold and when you look at that word love there is the word agape amen which means brotherly love god's love amen because iniquity shall abound now how many believes that we're living in a in an age right now where iniquity is abounding i mean if you you don't even have to watch cnn or the news or anything to know that something is wrong with this country something is going on something is wrong with this world iniquity is abounding you don't even know what to believe nowadays something is happening there's a shift taking place and we're in the middle of it amen it's iniquity because men are just the whoever whoever these these men are just going for broke doing whatever they need to do amen to bring out what they call their new world order and so the love of many shall wax cold now it will wax cold if we keep looking at that if we keep looking at those things and we keep looking at the at the at the at the heartache the carnage the destruction everything that's going on our love will eventually wax cold if we stop looking at that stuff and just keep our eyes on the word keep our eyes up up amen where our redemption draws now amen then we should get warmer in that love amen we should get harder in that love and not just for coming to church and and doing what you need to do but also for for a love for one another because it's connected amen how can you say you love god and you don't love your brother that you see and you say you love god that you don't see that's what the bible says right and and and and sometimes you know we come to church and and we do what we're supposed to do and we sing and everything like that but we can we don't have patience with one another we fail in such simple areas amen patience with one another the way we deal with one another the way we handle each other amen i think it's time for us to look at ourselves and see amen letting doubt letting go amen these little weights amen that are hindering us from keep moving forward that's that's draw that's making us are making our love wax cold but he that verse 13 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved amen and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations that's that wasn't that wasn't possible back during the time of the the disciples when jesus was here on earth it's possible now especially with the advent of the internet it's possible now the uh last when was it saturday saturday night i was preaching from my house i was preaching to the philippines about me i saw maybe 75 people listen listening under to brother royale's church just trying to pitch in helping them out you know that brother royal is out and uh it was just it dawned on me man that's amazing to think that i'm preaching from uh winder georgia in the manila philippines all across the ocean and i'm not there they're just seeing me and people are saying amen and things like that that's quite incredible and so this scripture this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached you see it shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come amen so that that has to be fulfilled now i want to i want us to look closely at verse 12 again and i want us to to look it says and because iniquity shall abound now what is iniquity let's look let's look here just a moment what iniquity is and we have heard the definition from brother branham and we're going to read that here in just a moment but let's look at at iniquity here at what the what the dictionary says it is it's it's gross immorality or injustice wickedness a grossly immoral act a sin lack of equity gross injustice unrighteousness wickedness amen and and look what it says here the condition of one without law or lawlessness amen if you don't think that we're living in that time now people don't care what what what anybody says they don't care what a church they don't care what a pastor says they don't even care what their parents say they don't even and most they don't care what their parents say most surely they don't care what what the government says they don't care what any any authority says i'm going to do what i want to do you saw it last year in the last summer amen with all the rights taking place and everybody they don't respect authority burning buildings and all kinds of stuff in the name of i don't know what cause you see if you and me were out there doing that we'd be we'd be jailed right away those people they got to get out quickly the condition of one without law lawlessness amen and we know speaking about that law amen the law of christ amen abiding in the law of christ praise god and so here's what the prophet the prophet's definition of what iniquity is amen there's four attributes that i looked at and reading some of what the prophet was was uh talking about iniquity there's four things that i noticed were attributes of iniquity amen and brother bran one of them is hypocrisy and brother brahman says here what is iniquity in the spoken word is the original seed he says something that you know that's wrong and you do it anyhow and you know that that god's word is right why do you play the hypocrite because of your organization and pick a little bit here and won't take the rest of it you worker of iniquity so that that's that's one one aspect of iniquity another aspect is blatant disobedience and brother brown says here iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but won't do it it's iniquity see you know they should stay with the word of god but for their church sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray for from the word of god and do what the organization says well i don't know my church says we should do it this way and i believe it this way see and it's right before you that you shouldn't do it it's just blatant disobedience just just i'm just gonna just do it anyhow amen another attribute of iniquity is is pride and self-centeredness and and and and ram says here in the message influence iniquity what is iniquity iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding to it when you know your creeds are wrong and you still hold to it that's iniquity amen you know it it's wrong but because you don't want to admit that you're wrong amen become you become prideful and you're you become self-centered now i i'm i'm looking at these because i want us and what we're going to look at in john chapter 13 uh at a character there in just a moment it all applies to him exactly amen and then it begins uh this iniquity the fourth thing is it begins in the heart before it manifests outwardly and it says what is iniquity brother brown says in the harvest time it it's something that you know that's right and you concede it and won't do it in your heart when you know that the bible teaches a certain thing and you won't do it that's iniquity and david said if i hide iniquity in my heart god will not even hear my prayer amen but see we live in a day nowadays that because i don't get struck by lightning nothing happens to me i just keep doing what i'm doing i keep sinning i keep with my filthy mouth i keep lying i keep cheating i keep doing anything and nothing's happening so that just you know i'll just keep doing it that's iniquity because at one point you knew that it was wrong you just keep doing until your mind is just completely seared and it just becomes like nothing's wrong anymore i believe this is how the condition of this world and if we're not careful it spills over into our chur into the church it's a spirit saints it's a spirit young people amen because they're natural amen types of spiritual amen a lot of times amen what's happening in the world if we're not careful it will affect us amen and we drag those spirits right in here amen and we affect one another praise the lord amen so i want you to keep those items in mind for for future reference and just i don't know if we'll have time tonight but we'll we'll we'll get that i'm just going to take my time i'm going to take my time you know like i said this might be several parts so and like i said i just hope you see it the way it's it the way you see you know sometimes we as ministers we get so excited about something oh my gosh you know and this is wonderful this is amazing i feel like jumping and shouting and running around in my study and and and and then you're like oh man but if they can just see it the way i see it but the dale you've been there and and so i hope hopefully just ask god for revelation amen praise god so the love of many shall wax cold now again and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now in looking at this verse let's just look at some obser observations there one iniquity will be abundant so there's plenty of iniquity right that's what the word abound means it means it's abundant would you just have plenty of it two the love will dwindle but not completely go away amen you see when brother branham drew when the angel of the lord drew that light there when on the church ages it was originally drawn as dark complete gross darkness in this day but god allowed amen for the prophet to be able to add that little bit of light amen that's you and me amen you and i amen in this dark and wicked hour you thought the uh the uh during martin luther's age was dark and it was evil and it was gross and it was this is his age is worse because there's attacks at least you saw the attack coming at you amen you see the attack came in as a in the form of a lion and what did what did the christians do man they would just huddle next to each other and lord receive our spirit amen we've believed upon you we've done everything we could amen and they just gave right in i believe god protect god allowed for them to not even feel any pain i believe that they stood for christ god will stand for them amen no we back then you saw the the attack coming at you now you just don't know where the attack is coming from it's so gray it's it's so shadowy it's so it's it's so uh uh um mysterious now we know it's there but satan is just working in every way now internet uh uh uh just all kinds of spirits everywhere now it's just it's just so so so uh uh if you're not careful you can be the seed another third observation there in that verse the love of many not all will dwindle amen i trust that that's us amen the love of many shall wax cold but not all and the love described here as i said earlier is the agape love now agape the word agape is is a is a feminine i thought that was interesting it's a noun a feminine noun love that is affection or benevolence specifically a love feast charity dear love affection good will love benevolence brotherly love love feasts and most important is the love that god loves us with amen god loves us in the agape love it's an unconditional love amen because maybe brother don may see things different a world a different world view or or political worldview maybe than i do amen it doesn't matter i still love my brother and he loves me because what what does what does unite us amen politics know the word should unite us amen what does what should unite amen and if you're allowing politics and world views amen to divide you amen then you don't have the love of christ dwelling in you you don't see that brother you don't see that sister amen as part of the body that you dwell in that's iniquity and the love of many shall wax cold the bible says see satan nowadays what what he's trying to do is again like i said earlier he's trying to divide each and every one of us i know i know people i've heard reports of even uh uh churches being divided with their current events and the current things amen being divided about the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated i mean if say if satan can do that nowadays man we we got it we need the holy ghost and we don't have the holy ghost amen how in the world can something like that divide us but it's happening it's happening in south america amongst message churches and we're not careful we'll allow those things to come and creep in here and you know is that the spirit of god no that's the spirit of satan because what satan tries to do is he tries to divide then conquer that's exactly what he does now brother branham here's a few things that brother branham speaking of of love wax and cold brother brown says here it used to be a long time ago when when the neighbor got sick or something we went over and cut his corn cut him some wood if it was winter time and today the neighbor can die and you don't know it till you read it in the paper well the first time i heard that i just laughed back when i first came into the message but it's true there is neighborhoods with houses right next to each other and they don't know one another that that's sad i mean in toronto canada i mean the houses are just so close to one another you know and different and and they don't know each other hardly no friendship among one another anymore that's awful brother branham says love because the iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold said jesus in the 24th chapter that's true he also says a long time ago when we used to run out of money we'd go over to the neighbor and borrow fifty dollars to hold us over while we didn't have no we didn't have to sign any notes we trusted one another you think you could go do that today you don't you can't trust anybody anymore you can't borrow five dollars now without a ten dollar security on top of it that was a lot of money back then that was 1951 when brother brown said this that's right no love the bible said because the love shall wax cold the love because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and he says here he continues to say that's what's the matter with the world they're dying for love they want to see love we got plenty of teaching plenty of plenty churches but we need a love of god amen i've said i've said before the world wants to see something genuine and they don't see it therefore everything uh they they get uh uh like they they just they they just believe in their mind they'll never get to see it but it's it's up to you and i saints because even when jesus prayed for us there in john 17 he says he asked for unity so that the world can see we're the only true people that can show the world what love is all about but if we hate one another and bicker amongst each other and fight amongst each other and and and and and and and all these things then what are we going to show to the world we're just like them amen praise god brother branham says now i see her my just happy and rejoicing and she heard about elizabeth this is speaking about elizabeth when she was pregnant with john the baptist and she wanted to share the blessing that's usually the way christians do right up into judea she went to share the blessing with mary or with elizabeth and i see her getting up there in judea you know to share the blessing i can see elizabeth setting maybe doing her knitting and when she seen mary coming maya she threw aside the croc crocheting or knitting ever what it was and run out there and grabbed her in her arms and began to hug her and kiss her well they had feelings so she many times you know the other day uh i was telling somebody hey you know how are you doing we we and uh how's how's school coming along you know how how's because i knew that he works for the same school district that i work for and it's like you you bother them asking them stopping them from what they're doing to ask them a question they just don't want to be bothered people don't want to be bothered hey you just want to be nice i had some neighbors that that that just moved out from our house and i was just trying to be nice and you know maybe hopefully get to share the gospel with them you know and and i was we were trying to set a a a day where we could go to their house you know or they come to ours and and we have you know pizza they had little kids and you know and uh just fellowship with them you know i don't mind fellowshipping with anybody if i have the opportunity to share the word with them you see you know i i'll drink coffee with you eat a piece of cake you know i don't care you know you may say a few bad words around me but hey i'm not gonna i i know where i'm standing amen let my life try to influence you i'm not afraid to hang out with you if i can win you for christ but some of us don't are not like that we're not around the believers i don't want to be around the world though i'm scared we're not like that why are we supposed to be a light to the world amen what's the world going to see they'd see their own they know their own they already got their own amen they want to see something different you're the ones who could show them something different so we set you know a time for them to you know and and the day came and uh i texted they texted me oh you know my wife doesn't think that we can get you know get together we'll just let you know when we get together you know we can get together again they never text it back they're right next door to us my wife's like you just feel bad you got your feelings hurt i just want to be nice but people don't want to be that way people don't have feelings anymore amen you know what's the matter with the people today brother branham he said we're getting away from that you don't feel for one another amen i want to ask you something and i'm being serious and asking you all what what is the spirit that would cause us to be afraid to come to church and shake one another's hand and and not even look at each other like we're a walking virus what is the spirit that would cause us to to to to view each other that way is it the spirit of god to be afraid to look at you know you know doing this number with everybody because you can't shake people's hands what spirit would cause you to do that just think about it because what what what what the lord wants is what the lord wants is unity i understand you know if you want to be careful and i respect that you know i understand that that's fine but i still want to hug you i still want to shake your hand and you and what what i'm saying is these little kids that's all they've learned for the past year and a half that's all they've taken with them i believe eventually it'll damage them mentally seeing people doing all this little fist bumping and all this kind of stuff i want a good old shake shaking of the hand get back to that that's normal to me and all this social distancing and all this stuff that's not normal that's satanic and everywhere we go i mean we're you looking at everybody like they're a biohazard that's what the world and and the people that that think they're going to live here eternally without god's eternal life in them want you to do that's what satan wants you to do i don't god doesn't want you to do that that's not the spirit of christ and you know what that is that is that that's that's fear and you know what fear is it's a lack of love that's what the bible says because look that's what first john says first john 4 18 says there is no fear in love does the bible say that there is no fear in love i don't know if they got it or not but perfect love casteth out fear you should be so trusting in in god so much amen that that god will protect me perfect love casteth out here because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love i didn't say that the bible says that that is what satan is trying to bring upon the people nowadays is fear fear fear fear if we're not careful amen it starts making us lose and wax cold in our love do you see how those two are connected at what point saints are we going to quit with the fear it's got to be you know we're not going in a rapture with all this you know all this stuff and stuff i thought we're going to be hugging one another and stuff like that fish bumping and all this stuff well and and first john 4 1 says their beloved believe not every spirit we should rightly discern every spirit believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god i told people last year when all this cobot hit and some of you all may remember that when all this cobit stuff hit and we started with all this mask wearing and all this stuff all this stuff that this was going to affect people mentally we see the results of that now mental health has increased the damages have increased anna you probably know you can you can talk to doctors i've heard testimonies of doctors of of little kids they have been they have been so uh uh their minds have been so twisted now that they go and see a doctor and the doctor says it's safe you can take your mask off it's okay honey the mom takes the mask off but the kid keeps the mask on and and the doctor says why don't you want to take your mask he says i'm afraid i might kill mommy what kind of spirit would tell a kid that that's not the spirit of god and so we have to be discerning of every spirit the bible says believe believe not every spirit but try every but try the spirit and i know if you continue reading it talks about false prophets have come into the land but it says try every spirit amen now brother brown continues saying why it used to be when i was a kid if the neighbor got sick while we went over there and coat wood for them and and help them fill the silo cut their corn and mama would go down and wash up the kids and get their breakfast for them when somebody was sick but now you don't even know your neighbor is dead unless you're dead you read in the paper there's no feeling the bible said because iniquity abound the love of many shall wax cold there it is why when my daddy would need 50 he'd go over and borrow it from the farmer friend he'd pay him back when he's he sold the crop while you couldn't borrow five dollars now without a 50 security that's right no feeling no trust god have mercy on a people falling away and he continues saying affection love for one another that's right they go around here not long ago you go downtown you see somebody and instead of saying howdy do or something like that they just pass a little silly grin look over there like a possum that's been in a blackberry patch somewhere [Laughter] looking over like that you you know just a little old silly grin hello maybe like that oh you know what i like i like an old-fashioned pump handle handshake amen what happened to that i haven't seen a good whole handshake in a year and a half but hey look if you don't want to honestly if you don't i'll respect that but just telling you that's how i feel amen because i'm not going to fear this thing i'm not going to fear the devil i'm not going to fear jesus amen to make somebody else happy amen john 15 10 tells us again going back to going back to what we were reading at the beginning john 15 10 if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love amen now let's look at let's look at the commandments here just a moment we know that in the even in the ten commandments with it that that the lord gave to moses amen in exodus chapter 20 verses one through six it says in god spake all these words saying and you can read on down and then in verse six it says and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments amen so god was concerned about about about love and you can read the whole commandments there as well as in deuteronomy chapter 5 verses 6 through 10. but now jesus comes in in mark chapter 12 and he talks about the greatest commandment because it's asked of him lord what is the greatest commandment and and let's read this here real quick in mark chapter 12 i told you we're going to do a lot of reading so just bear with me mark chapter 12 verse 28 and one of the scribes came and haven't heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hero israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and then he continues and says and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and then he says there is none other commandment greater than these he didn't go mentioning you know thou shalt not steal thou shalt not amen because if you have love in your heart you won't do those things he put those at the beginning because he knows if you have love amen the love of god if you love god the way you need to love god amen and you love your neighbor the way you won't steal you won't commit adultery you won't cheat you won't lie you won't do these things amen and verse in verse 32 and the scribe said unto him well master thou has saith the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbor as his self is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly i want you to notice this because look what he says he says and he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that there's ask him any question amen jesus tied this love amen to the kingdom of god this is part of the kingdom amen the love of god is part of the kingdom amen now let's look at let's look here just a moment at and we got a few more minutes i promise you i won't leave you here too long tonight let's look at some things here in john chapter 13. amen and i want you to look at there's some interesting points here in john chapter 13. we know that 13 represents a woman 13 apostles but had to be 12. amen uh so so when judas died and then matthias i think he was selected after after judas died there so it became 12. amen judas he we in this chapter we see judas he shows his true colors and we know that the u.s shows her true colors give herself completely over to the beast in revelations chapter 13. complete apostasy amen so this is all turning saints this is all eventually we'll turn to religious one to one man worship at some point in time at some point in time i don't know what all the details will be but at some point in time the uh antichrist is going to be make a a a a a pact with the jews and and and you we shouldn't be bad here at that time amen and everybody will wonder after the beast the bible says those that are not sealed upon their forehead so i want us to i want us to read john chapter 13 but we're gonna we're gonna read it and i just wanted to look at it verse by verse and and but i want us to read it here so that so that everybody can understand it i i tried to compare both from the king james version and the contemporary english version and everything seems to be following it's lined up so i want to read in the cv version the contemporary english version and uh let's look at this here so in verse in verse 1 it says it was before the it was before passover and jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and to return to the father he had always loved his followers in this world and he loved them to the very end even before the evening meal started the devil had made judas the son of simon iscariot decide to betray jesus amen in the king james version it says in supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him so now here we go we're talking about iniquity while ago and here comes amen iniquity coming into the heart of judas right so you know satan comes and sly he doesn't come in amen just he doesn't come in just like that because it'll be just too obvious he comes in very slightly he starts working with the heart because it's the deeds of the nickelodeons right that and it starts with the deeds or it starts with the saying there was a saying then it goes into the deeds eventually it gets in into the people's minds and so that's where that iniquity started amen so that true iniquity begins in the heart before it manifests outwardly amen what you know what about all these all the people leaving the message today what at some point in time they had something that was speaking to their heart some some seed of doubt crept in and eventually it manifested externally outwardly now now saints uh you know we're not the we we're not supposed to be the judges of anybody i've heard i heard even of a testimony here lately of someone that had supposedly left the message and then now they're back somewhere up north and they're serving the lord they they they're sorry that they did that they they repent so so we we really can't rule somebody out when they say i don't believe brother branham anymore we have to be careful with that because you're not the judge but now you know when you start pushing and pedaling amen to everybody when you're supposed to be doing your own thing going to church if you're so right and you're so just go to church serve the lord and let others serve the lord too but they they get on their on their on their marketing and and they got books and they got videos and and they're just busy 24 7. and that's all they do i don't even know if they spend time with their family i don't even know if they get to eat or go to the bathroom or anything because i mean they have a new publication every every day just about now there's something wrong then something's happened to you you've become a judas now verse three jesus knew he had come from god and would go back to god he also now i want you to pay attention to this he knew at this point at this point he knew that he had come from god and would go back to god he also knew that the father had given him complete power so watch so during the meal jesus got up verse 4 removed his outer garment and wrapped a towel around his waist i want you to pay attention because a lot happened here in this chapter and it's similar to what's happening in our day in our day in time he put water into a large bowl then he began washing his disciples feet and drying them with the towel he was wearing man what a great act of humility the master the king of kings the creator of the universe the one who created the disciples the created judas created their souls he got down to wash the disciples dirty feet and told us that that should be an example for each one of us he really loved them now that within itself is not just for us when we do foot washing but it was a it was a it was a lesson that jesus was trying to teach us that if we do love one another that was the way you say you love god and the way you say you love your brother amen what would you not would you really give up your life for your friends would you really give up your life for your brother would you really give up your life for your sister if you if you've really received a revelation in your heart that that's your brother and that's your sister you would humble yourself and you would not do anything amen to hurt amen that their their trust their uh their uh you know of who they are because you know they're part of the same body you belong to if we start looking at each other that way my goodness that would we would go we would go so far in this walk with christ amen see he knew he had this power all power was given to him and yet he still humbled himself to wash their feet i just want us to think about that because the scriptures here don't put that there just to have that there that he knew that he had power and that all everything belonged to him and then he goes and washed his feet one of the lowest things that you could do at that time you know to be a foot washed flunky to watch the dirty manure and the sweat coming off the streets and everything like that amen you can just imagine the smell and everything jesus just nobody told him did he just just did it amen now the word humility let's look at the word humility real quick it says it means the quality or condition of being humble the state or character of being humble freedom from pride and arrogance lowliness of mind a low estimate of oneself self-abasement when you when you look at yourself amen in a low state amen that you're not bigger than somebody else you're not better than somebody else amen then your humility is working in you but when you think you're better and bigger than somebody else god's got to do some work in your life and watch where and then the other thing is it's an act of submission that's what humility is you submit jesus submitted himself to the disciples when he was their master he was their their lord he was their rabbi he was their god he didn't ask for their permission he just went and did it and he did it with all his heart because he really loved them i want us to remember that love love love love that's all part of the kingdom that's what we're talking about that's the law of christ amen now continuing in verse six it was just a few more minutes but when he came to simon peter this disciple asked lord are you going to wash my feet so peter asked him are you going to wash my feet jesus answered you don't really know what i am doing but later you will understand and in verse 8 you will never wash my feet peter replied you're not going to wash my feet just like some of us you know we think we know better than jesus you ain't washing my feet because you think you're doing a good deed if jesus said in his word if he knows better than you it's best to you just let him do what he wants a a a a lamb a man a sheep my sheep hear my voice the bible says a lamb submits a goat kicks and butts right so whatever god wants to do with us amen just let them lord uh uh just do with me whatever you want to do and and peter eventually caught on to it then because watch what he says in verse 9 peter said lord don't wash just my feet wash my hands and my head now now jesus before that he says and if i don't wash you jesus told him you don't really belong to me that's what he told them in other words if you don't let me do what i know it's best and you don't really belong to me so peter said lord don't wash just my feet wash my hands in my head too just all right lord just i'm all in then amen that's why we should all be just all in let god and let god let go and let god have his way in our lives jesus answered people who have bathed and are clean all over need to what need to wash just their feet right he was talking about a a a physical bathing right they just need to wash their feet when they come in and you know if they bathe at home they've walked from one place to another and then when they get there all they need to do is just wash their feet that's what jesus was talking about but watch what he says here and you my disciples are clean except for one of you now he's turning into spiritual because remember they were they were justified sanctified under the word of jesus right you are now amen uh by the washington of the water of the word the word that they received amen for three and a half years during jesus ministry amen it justified and sanctified them jesus said at one point he said sanctify sanctify them by the by thy truth thy word is truth amen in verse 11 jesus knew who would betray him that is why he said except for one of you one of you right now is unclean one of you has a devil one of you not just has a devil in one place he said it is a devil in matthew chapter 10 and verse 12 after jesus had washed his disciples feet and had put his outer garment back on he sat down again then he said do you understand what i have done and i want to ask you that do you understand what what he has done or are we just floaters we just come to church we just do what we're supposed to do and but we don't know exactly this plan of redemption for ourselves do you because we need to if we're to have the love of god in us amen we need to know what redemption is about we need to get saved and get born again if we're going to have the love of god in us do you understand jesus wanted them to understand what i just did to them and that was the foot washing so it's important for jesus for you to understand what he has done for you what he did on the cross what does that mean the significance of that all those things that we easily can take for granted if we're not careful jesus says in verse 13. i hope you're still with me amen you call me your teacher and lord and you should because that is who i am and if your lord and teacher has washed your feet you should do the same for each other and that's where we get the commandment for us to actually do it doing it that's where we do it physically you see it's not that that it it's an act of humility but it also brings us back to what jesus did amen it doesn't doesn't doesn't wash us of our sins or anything like that but it's you amen saying i believe what jesus i understand what jesus did amen and now this symbol is symbolizing amen what i need to be doing every day not just the day we come and wash our feet you see i i should be willing again we were reading i believe it was in galatians to be able to carry one another's burden you know if your bird and brother boyd is your feet are dirty amen let me see what i can do about that i don't know if i'll you know go ahead and pedicure and everything if you need it [Laughter] or your wife can take care of that but you look at each other and you see you know as as in the bible it says you know how how what kind of person would you be if you see a brother in need and you just just pat him on the back and you say you just go on go on brother go on sister lord bless you you see that they're in need and you just i'll pray for you but you forget to is that carrying your brother's burden is that is that carrying your sister's burden oh my you see it goes it goes further than just you know you just think about those things okay verse 14 if your lord and teacher has washed your feet you should do the same for each other i have set the example and you should do for each other exactly what i have done for you god help us god help us to to serve one another in this way i tell you for certain that servants are not greater than their master and messengers are not greater than the one who sent them and you see in the world there's positions there's ranks there's the masters and there's the ones that serve those masters and but jesus is trying to tell them here he just he pretty much just kind of threw a little curveball at them amen in other words to tell on them think about what i just now did i am your master i am your creator you call me lord and so i am and yet i got down to do this for you he wanted them to think because later he said that you won't understand it now but you'll understand later amen verse 17 you know these things and god will bless you if you do them in in in the king james verses are happy are you if you do these things amen and verse 18 it says i am not talking about all of you i know the ones i have chosen but what the scriptures say must come true and they say the man who ate with me has turned against me that's what the scriptures say so he's talking about jesus he's talking about judas there now we're almost done we just got just a few more things and he's talking about judas now let's look at judas for just a moment judas was was was with him for three and a half years and saw the miracles he cast out devils maybe healed the sick and and all those things he had power to do those things as god as jesus gave them but notice he did not he did not eat jesus he ate with jesus but did not eat him he didn't think of him as the bread of life that he was amen because that's what jesus said the man who ate with me has turned against me there's so many people that have eaten with jesus have been in the message have lived in this word have rejoiced in it have enjoyed the good word and then turn against him later on and by turning and by them turning against you they're turning against god amen in hebrews chapter 6 verse 4 through 6 it says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened it is impossible it is impossible for those who are once enlightened have tasted of the heavenly gift tasted and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance in other words if they fall away it's impossible to renew them back to repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame and we see that a lot going on now the last two verses here in john chapter 13 i am telling you this before it all happens jesus says then when it does happen you will believe who i am i tell you for certain that anyone who welcomes my messengers also welcomes me and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me amen and we'll just leave it right there and we will continue because i got plenty of more content this all ties in very well with other things maybe next time we minister but it's important saints amen to abide by the law of christ because listen god jesus said this commandment i give you this new commandment i give you now he's not doing away with his commandments but this is the commandment i give you get love love and you'll be able to fulfill it with all the other ones amen he was not doing away with the commandments he was bringing in amen the only thing that you have to worry about is loving one another loving him loving one another that's what he said but it's one of the most toughest things to do especially amongst the family sometimes even with things the family is hard but if you can't even love your own family members how are you going to love the brother that goes to church you're always fighting and bickering amongst one another in within the family how are you not going to do that in the church amen things to think about i like throwing little curveballs like that make y'all think i hope it helps because you know it's the little foxes that spoil the vine that we neglect i mean we can explain daniel 70 weeks and everything that's wonderful we need all of that but then these little things we neglect and they all tie in together right it's not like they're separated from each other they all tie in i'm just maybe sent here to to kind of throw the little curve balls to you but god help us amen god help us so let's stand to our feet are you saying this song uh created me a clean heart i don't know hey man let's just sing this before we we leave you love the lord i hope you you learned something something to think about oh buddy my intention is not to hurt anybody's feelings that's not what i want that's certainly the word hurts i mean that's the word then but uh that wasn't my intention i just i just really i want us to look at ourselves as that's just so impressed me this this week you know the love that we have for one another is waning cold that we just so quickly just insult one another and instead of feeling for one another you know we just quickly just say things and you know and in such you know where's the love the brother or the sister needs help amen where's that love at you see amen [Music] [Music] me [Music] spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence oh lord take not thy holy spirit from me [Music] [Applause] restore unto me the joy of my salvation [Music] one more time unto him [Music] our right spirit within me [Music] creating me a clean [Music] within me cast me not away from thy presence oh lord [Music] [Applause] restore [Music] [Applause] amen praise the lord all minds and hearts clear brother wade is there anything that we need to mention all right amen so just remember one another in prayer keep keep holding each one of those that are sick and each each other in prayer amen you pray for me amen i i need prayer amen we all need prayer not just for sickness amen but for our spiritual lives amen god almighty we just need to get closer to god amen and i just see that more and more amen praise the lord as a time and god is allowing these times for this so that we can look within ourselves and see does it really matter about these things in life amen does it really matter what what what who who i believe should be the president and all this kind of stuff amen why does that matter that won't take me to heaven amen me figuring and fighting about who can be in the white house and with this that or the other or world views and all this kind of stuff amen that won't change my my body none of it will the only thing that'll change your body is the word feeding on the word amen and looking within yourself lord where am i failing you am i really loving the brethren the way i need to love the brethren because that's how you advance the kingdom you're not going to advance the kingdom you know bringing out your political ideas that's right you know and people have fallen into that again a divide and conquer mechanism by satan let's not allow satan to do that let's let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word lord we pray lord that you look at help us to look at these things more closely and lord realizing lord god almighty that these things are in the word for us lord father god they're not just their lord just to fill space lord god but let us father take this word this word father and let us apply and live it lord jesus and lord you reveal it to us further lord god lord that we may draw closer to one another in love and unity that you described there in john chapter 17 lord when you prayed for us father and we ask lord that you bless your people now uh go with them father protect them on the roads continue to be with brother they'll just strengthen him lord sister peggy lord god brother wait lord just continue to strengthen them before lord and and lord all the ones that are sick amongst us father god just blessed and be with them father lord we expect to hear good reports here in the next few days father we love you we commit ourselves into your hands now in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you saints the nations are breaking and israel's awakened the signs of the bible foretold
