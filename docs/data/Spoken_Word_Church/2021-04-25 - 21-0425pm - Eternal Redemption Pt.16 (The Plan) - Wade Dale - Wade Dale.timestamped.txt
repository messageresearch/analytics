[17:20] that everybody all right with that amen
[17:22] that's all the announcements
[17:24] if you would turn your bibles to hebrews
[17:26] 9 we'll continue on with
[17:28] with the message of eternal redemption
[17:34] i know i'm going at it slow but i'm just
[17:36] trying to i'm trying to not get ahead
[17:38] um sister julie likes my charts so
[17:42] what you got yours with you no
[17:46] oh huh oh
[17:50] she's mumbling under her mask
[17:53] okay i have plenty up here i have plenty
[17:56] if y'all need some more just get get she
[17:59] she wanted one last sunday
[18:01] i didn't get it i know you didn't i know
[18:04] you and it's on tape
[18:06] and i cannot believe you walked up this
[18:08] close to the to the front
[18:12] without fainting brother gary i wish i
[18:15] was humble like him but i just can't i'm
[18:16] just not that way
[18:18] i just can't we god made one and that's
[18:20] about it so thank god
[18:21] i'm talking about me not him so he
[18:24] everybody say man hebrews 9 11.
[18:31] we're going to read and continue on with
[18:34] our thought
[18:35] pick up a little extra thought today we
[18:37] talk about perfect love
[18:39] but i came upon a quote
[18:42] and i know it the time is accelerating
[18:47] if you're not reading your bible and
[18:49] studying more and reading the prophet's
[18:50] message
[18:51] more than you are backslid
[18:55] because i you know i've been we listen
[18:58] to sermons and we read and we do our
[19:00] daily devotion and we continue
[19:02] to keep on reading and you know i've
[19:05] probably read this message
[19:06] 20 times and i didn't see this until
[19:09] just the other day so it's just that's
[19:11] just the way god works
[19:13] but you know what if you'd never read it
[19:14] again you said well i didn't get
[19:15] anything out of that the first time well
[19:17] read it a second time
[19:18] and a third time you'll get something
[19:20] out of because you know what his word
[19:21] will not return
[19:22] void it will accomplish exactly what it
[19:25] said it would do
[19:26] all right and it will be in his decreed
[19:29] time
[19:30] and its decreed season all right so
[19:33] that's what we're looking at we're
[19:34] looking at the season
[19:35] of adoption or we're also looking at the
[19:38] season
[19:39] of culminating you can't really
[19:42] culminate eternal redemption but you can
[19:44] culminate redemption for the gentile
[19:46] bride
[19:48] everybody got that bride the gentile
[19:50] bride our culmination will be a body
[19:53] change
[19:54] here in the near future and that will
[19:55] take care of the gentile dispensation
[19:57] but god's
[19:58] eternal redemption will continue on on
[20:01] into the future home and all the way
[20:03] through so hebrews 9 11
[20:05] let's pray before we get started dear
[20:07] lord thank you for this day thank you
[20:08] for this purpose that we
[20:10] have assembled here lord you told us to
[20:13] meet
[20:14] you told us to meet lord together and
[20:16] where two or three are gathered in your
[20:17] name that you will be in the midst
[20:20] lord i believe there's more than two or
[20:21] three gathered today in your name father
[20:23] so
[20:23] may you pour out a blessing that we
[20:25] cannot contain
[20:26] father that our bowl will be full and
[20:29] we'll go home and say well it was good
[20:31] that we heard from you today lord father
[20:34] we pray that you'd be with the ones that
[20:35] are not here the ones that are watching
[20:36] online
[20:38] sister mary the family there says cathy
[20:42] we asked you to bless them lord in the
[20:44] time of grief father that
[20:47] you're you're the prince of peace you're
[20:50] the only one that knows how to take care
[20:52] of each situation lord
[20:53] and i pray that you'll do that father we
[20:56] pray that you bless the ones here take
[20:58] care of us lord through this furthermore
[20:59] the service you be the speaker you'd be
[21:01] the one doing the revealing
[21:03] lord heal the sick
[21:07] but mainly lord heal the sin sick the
[21:09] ones that you watch lord and you watch
[21:11] them go backwards day by day and
[21:14] you we pour our heart out lord but only
[21:17] you
[21:18] will be able to touch them but lord lead
[21:20] us and guide us in a way lord that we'll
[21:22] go down maybe someone's path today and
[21:25] and we'll speak something that'll bring
[21:27] a revelation in our heart lord
[21:29] that will change their life and that
[21:32] they'll change their attitude towards
[21:34] you lord we pray
[21:36] these things lord earnestly because
[21:38] we're coming toward the end of this time
[21:40] of the gentile dispensation and lord
[21:43] we're
[21:43] showing lord that perfect love is going
[21:46] to have to be on the scene or
[21:47] or you're not going to be here lord we
[21:49] pray that you'd just sanctify us lord
[21:51] for this journey forgive us of our sins
[21:53] bless our pastor
[21:54] keep each one of them safe lord
[21:57] go to church here father and the ones
[21:59] that are in this building today lord
[22:00] just give us an extra
[22:02] strong revelation father injury
[22:05] we pray these things lord in earnest in
[22:07] jesus name
[22:08] amen but christ being coming high priest
[22:11] of good things to come by a greater more
[22:13] perfect tabernacle
[22:15] not made with hands that is to say not
[22:17] of this building
[22:18] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[22:20] but by his own blood he entered in once
[22:22] into the holy place
[22:24] having obtained eternal redemption
[22:28] for us and we'll get into that a little
[22:29] bit later let's go to first john 4.
[22:34] and what what great a man would know
[22:37] about love than john is
[22:38] as in the little john's he's been to the
[22:40] isle of patmos he's seen
[22:42] the antichrist but he's also seen jesus
[22:44] christ
[22:45] he's seen the bride come to full
[22:47] fruition he's seen her
[22:49] in revelations 19 become a wife not be a
[22:52] bride but become a wife
[22:54] and he saw a future home coming down out
[22:56] of the heaven
[22:57] and now he goes back and he he's
[22:59] preaching you know
[23:00] brother brown said he was the pastor of
[23:02] ephesus after paul passed away he
[23:04] pastored ephesus church and i believe he
[23:06] was writing this not only to the
[23:08] ephesians but to us
[23:09] and we have known and believed the love
[23:11] that god hath to us
[23:13] god is love and he that dwelleth in love
[23:16] dwelleth in god
[23:18] and god in him hearing as our love our
[23:22] love made perfect because we don't know
[23:24] how to love
[23:26] like god loves our feeling of love and
[23:29] god's love is totally separate
[23:31] amen totally at the other end both ends
[23:34] of the spectrum hearing is our love made
[23:37] perfect that we may have what
[23:39] boldness in the day of judgment because
[23:41] as he is so are we in this world
[23:44] there is no fear and love but perfect
[23:46] love catholics out fear
[23:48] because fear has torment he that feareth
[23:51] is not made perfect in love
[23:54] we love him because he first love uh
[23:56] loved us
[23:58] if a man say i love god and hates his
[24:00] brother he is a liar
[24:01] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[24:03] he hath seen how can he love god
[24:06] whom he hath not seen you may be seated
[24:08] in the lord as blessing to the reading
[24:10] of the word
[24:11] we'll continue on into ephesians but you
[24:13] look at that he says
[24:14] how can you love god whom you hath not
[24:17] seen
[24:18] how many of you have seen jesus christ
[24:19] in the flesh
[24:21] you have not seen the person jesus
[24:23] christ but his characteristic has been
[24:25] from the foundation of the world
[24:27] written in a bible written by prophets
[24:30] and is given to us in the end time by
[24:32] a prophet and as we were talking about
[24:35] um brother ray yesterday we need to get
[24:38] this right when we're
[24:39] like when you were in a mixed uh
[24:42] multitude of people
[24:44] and we just jump in and i noticed some
[24:46] of them brother aaron was singing that
[24:47] song
[24:48] the original life the original seed well
[24:50] that that's not made for a
[24:51] denominational world
[24:53] that's not made for a bad you won't hear
[24:55] baptist singing that in their
[24:56] in here in their sanctuary and
[24:59] but we we what we identify with it
[25:02] though
[25:03] so that's why i was trying to tell them
[25:05] yesterday you kind of try to soften it
[25:06] up a little bit
[25:08] and tell them that you know you just say
[25:09] bless god god sent a prophet you know
[25:11] you just dump the whole load on them you
[25:12] don't need to do that
[25:15] i was started the sermon by telling
[25:18] people that brother ray
[25:18] accepted john 3 16 first
[25:23] if you accept john 3 16 first and you
[25:26] ask
[25:26] god this agape love to come into your
[25:29] heart then you will have to
[25:30] in the end time see that god sent you
[25:33] then malachi 4
[25:34] elijah the prophet before the great and
[25:37] dreadful day of the lord
[25:38] and you'll turn the heart back all right
[25:40] well now if you'll do it that way then
[25:42] don't ever try to go and witness the
[25:44] people about william branham being a
[25:45] prophet
[25:46] because in the end time you know you
[25:48] might have got by with that in the 60s
[25:50] because it was fresh on people's mind
[25:51] they could say yeah i know a
[25:53] i know an aunt or i know an uncle i know
[25:55] somebody that went to the meeting that
[25:57] knew somebody went to the meeting we saw
[25:58] the miracles
[25:59] but now all you see is internet
[26:03] all you see is you know if somebody say
[26:05] william branham's name oh well you just
[26:06] put anybody's name in and google it and
[26:08] you're going to get something
[26:09] all right well you put his name in there
[26:12] now
[26:12] and you're not going to get a lot of the
[26:14] good right
[26:16] but if you'll get them to jesus christ
[26:17] that's what the prophet said he said i'm
[26:19] afraid we're not getting them to christ
[26:21] we're getting them to a doctrine well if
[26:23] if if christ is not
[26:25] in this message you know you know what
[26:28] i'm saying if christ is not the
[26:30] center piece of this message
[26:34] then you just it's nothing it's just
[26:37] let's just read the books just like
[26:38] clarence larkin or some other great
[26:40] person that
[26:41] that spoke and and you know you say well
[26:44] what what is it but no get them born
[26:45] again first
[26:47] do that right instead of shaking a hand
[26:49] as a baptist do or the sprinkling is the
[26:51] method that's doing the different ones
[26:53] get them born again see that they need
[26:54] to be baptized in the right way of
[26:57] christian baptism and then you start
[26:59] talking to them maybe
[27:00] a little bit about the message of the
[27:01] hour because you don't want to choke
[27:03] people
[27:04] that's what we've done brother dick
[27:06] always uh made a
[27:08] a outstanding statement very simple he
[27:10] said i bruised a lot of fruit
[27:13] which means he talked to a lot of people
[27:15] that you know if you're
[27:16] if you treat fruit really rough it
[27:18] doesn't last long
[27:19] it gets bruised you take a you take here
[27:22] we in the south you take a nanner
[27:24] everybody know what an enter is close to
[27:26] a mater
[27:28] made in a tater you take a banana though
[27:31] and you buy it you know and you throw it
[27:32] against the wall and you throw it down
[27:34] on the counter well it's not going to
[27:35] last long well that's what brother dick
[27:36] was talking about he was doing
[27:37] he was trying to really force the
[27:39] message onto this
[27:40] real soft fruit and he bruised a lot of
[27:43] fruit
[27:43] and i would say brother tom paul bush
[27:45] did the same thing but
[27:47] uh but you know what it's your zeal this
[27:48] you're zealous to tell them about it but
[27:50] you got to tell them about jesus christ
[27:52] first
[27:53] and number one you got to live the life
[27:54] before the people
[27:56] because they're going to watch it all
[27:57] right so that's why we look here we say
[28:00] who how can he love god whom he hath not
[28:02] seen
[28:03] now how can we how can we have a chart
[28:07] today or how can we have a bible how can
[28:09] we have
[28:10] quotes unless we have seen the
[28:12] manifestation
[28:14] of this man that had this plan of
[28:17] eternal redemption
[28:18] that it was in his mind before the
[28:20] foundation of the world and that
[28:22] that the lamb was slain before the
[28:23] foundation of the world and that
[28:25] everything was taken care of before the
[28:26] foundation of the world in the mind of
[28:28] god but now jesus christ had to
[28:31] literally come down to this earth
[28:33] and be crucified on a cross in these
[28:36] first three dimensions that we've been
[28:37] talking about
[28:38] or that would not be fulfilled
[28:42] because everything that's in the mind of
[28:44] god has to be fulfilled
[28:46] amen so we see now though the
[28:49] manifestation of that man that hung on
[28:52] the cross
[28:52] because if you don't have a personal
[28:54] intimate relationship with jesus christ
[28:56] you don't you you haven't got the person
[28:59] so you not act you don't act like the
[29:01] person
[29:02] all right and the person's
[29:03] characteristics is the bible
[29:06] all right everybody got that and it's
[29:07] really simple i want to start off
[29:09] like that first though because i want us
[29:11] to be able to
[29:12] to talk to people about the lord
[29:18] and get them solid in the lord
[29:21] then give them the message then then
[29:23] then give them
[29:24] have you ever read malachi 4 and they'll
[29:27] probably say yes i've read it but that's
[29:28] elijah for over yonder or that's elijah
[29:30] for here or that's elijah john the
[29:31] baptist
[29:32] no and then you just start piecing it
[29:34] together for him and it becomes a
[29:36] beautiful picture
[29:38] i think sometimes we
[29:41] try to slam dunk it you know and it's
[29:44] not going to happen like that
[29:46] we don't want to bruise so many fruits
[29:47] so let's let's go to ephesians 1 as we
[29:49] were
[29:50] speaking last sunday and read verse four
[29:53] according as he has chosen us in him
[29:54] before the foundation of the world
[29:56] that we should be holy and without blame
[29:58] before him in love
[30:00] having predestinated us into the
[30:02] adoption of children now
[30:03] brother dale's been on adoption we've
[30:04] talked about adoption
[30:07] we need to have that on our heart and
[30:08] our mind because it's not just that
[30:10] we're
[30:10] we're we're born again we have to come
[30:13] to full
[30:14] maturity amen and coming to full
[30:16] maturity
[30:18] comes by of jesus christ obtaining this
[30:21] eternal
[30:22] redemption for us as brother ray
[30:25] passed on he was part of that plan but
[30:28] he had to leave something here
[30:32] the kuckleberg had to stay the shell had
[30:35] to stay because it got caught in the
[30:36] first three dimensions as we were
[30:38] talking about
[30:39] we all got caught in these first three
[30:40] dimensions after
[30:42] jesus or after adam the first
[30:46] adam sold us out we were
[30:50] stuck in these first three dimensions
[30:51] and even adam
[30:53] his own body i was thinking about this
[30:57] last night and we're gonna go through
[30:59] this in just a minute
[31:00] but have you ever thought about after
[31:04] calvary and after the day of pentecost
[31:09] there's not that it's so clear where
[31:12] everybody goes when they pass away
[31:15] but now if you go to the old testament
[31:18] you have an enoch
[31:20] what happened there i don't know the
[31:22] prophet said he didn't know
[31:24] elijah carried away in a chariot
[31:28] moses he died but he didn't die
[31:31] they can't find his body you see that
[31:34] all happened in the old testament but
[31:36] when we come to the new testament
[31:37] when christ come and fulfilled all the
[31:40] law and the prophets and gave us a new
[31:42] testimony
[31:43] then we were very clear about where we
[31:46] were going because the man that had
[31:48] designed the plan was standing on earth
[31:51] and he said okay if you believe in me
[31:53] and and you know even if you
[31:55] die that you're going you're going to be
[31:57] where i am
[31:58] all right but now enoch and moses and
[32:01] elijah in the old testament under the
[32:03] blood of bulls and goats as we mentioned
[32:05] many times before
[32:07] that we see that there was a it was kind
[32:09] of a little
[32:10] you're under the law and it was paradise
[32:13] and the men were old and
[32:15] you understand you see what i'm saying
[32:17] but but that had to be part of the plan
[32:20] but let's not spend so much time
[32:23] wondering where enoch is
[32:26] because i believe we'll see him i don't
[32:28] worry about where moses and elijah is
[32:30] and remember
[32:30] it's not the literal moses and elijah
[32:32] that goes into the two witnesses
[32:34] it's the two spirit of moses and the
[32:36] spirit of elijah
[32:37] that's going to enter into these two
[32:39] prophets and they're going to preach
[32:40] after we leave
[32:42] so let's not worry so much about that
[32:43] they can't come until we leave
[32:45] right so we got to get ready to get out
[32:48] of here first
[32:49] and then as we get ready to get out of
[32:51] here
[32:52] he can go to the jews let's read verse 7
[32:55] in whom we have redemption through his
[32:57] blood
[32:58] i want to read you a quote here in just
[32:59] a minute that will help us on that
[33:02] you know we we know jesus christ came
[33:04] and we know he died in human flesh
[33:05] let me read you something only a prophet
[33:07] could say this the way he said it verse
[33:10] 8 wherein he hath the bounded toward us
[33:11] in all wisdom and prudence having made
[33:13] known unto us the mystery
[33:15] of his will according to his good
[33:17] pleasure which he has purposed
[33:20] in himself that in a dispensation of the
[33:22] fullness of times he might gather
[33:23] together
[33:24] in one all things in christ both which
[33:26] are in heaven and which are on earth
[33:28] even in him
[33:29] in whom also we have obtained an
[33:31] inheritance and we talked about that
[33:32] before
[33:34] and we'll not go over this again we're
[33:35] going to carry on so we don't have to go
[33:36] over these
[33:38] same scriptures we've been reading for
[33:39] 16 times and i hope it's not bored you
[33:41] because i get something out of it every
[33:42] time i read it
[33:44] in him also we have obtained an
[33:46] inheritance now remember
[33:48] remember what i told you brother brown
[33:50] said jesus didn't come to bring you your
[33:51] inheritance in other words
[33:53] what's brother brown saying he's saying
[33:56] that jesus didn't come down here on
[33:58] earth
[33:58] to develop a plan
[34:03] he already had the plan
[34:07] he came to get us back to the plan
[34:11] because he was the plan maker but that's
[34:13] what brother ram was saying he said no
[34:14] no no he said jesus didn't come to bring
[34:16] you inheritance
[34:17] he didn't because your inheritance was
[34:18] before the foundation of the world
[34:20] he came to make a way for you to get
[34:22] back to your inheritance
[34:24] amen and that inheritance by the new
[34:26] birth it comes into your soul
[34:28] but still there's a peace because we
[34:30] were stuck in three dimensions
[34:32] there's still a piece of you that's got
[34:33] to stay here
[34:35] i wanted to get into that yesterday but
[34:37] i didn't want to take up too much time
[34:39] of
[34:39] where there's terrestrial bodies and
[34:41] celestial bodies and even paul you know
[34:43] talking about being absent in the body
[34:45] and
[34:45] being present with the lord but now i'm
[34:47] present with you guys and i can't be
[34:49] with the lord he couldn't be in human
[34:50] what was paul saying i cannot be in
[34:52] human flesh
[34:54] and be where the lord is i'm going to
[34:57] have to drop
[34:58] this part to go see god so to be absent
[35:02] in the body
[35:04] is to be present with the lord you see
[35:06] that's what brother ray did yesterday he
[35:08] he became absent in the body
[35:11] human body kucleber had to stay here
[35:15] his shell so that he could be present
[35:17] with the lord he can't carry all those
[35:19] pieces together yet
[35:21] there's only one reason immortality
[35:23] jesus had to go to the cross die
[35:25] death burial resurrection he had to go
[35:26] to hell then he had to resurrect he had
[35:29] to come back on the day of pentecost so
[35:30] that you and i can develop
[35:32] the rest of this plan does everybody got
[35:34] that amen
[35:35] and the longer y'all sleep the longer
[35:37] i'm gonna preach
[35:39] my heavens people come on you put a
[35:42] movie on and watch it for three hours
[35:44] never get up and pee or nothing you just
[35:46] sat there
[35:48] that's right did you see that run that
[35:51] back
[35:54] come on some of y'all can't stay here 15
[35:56] minutes without either going to sleep or
[35:58] going to take the bathroom
[35:59] we'll discuss that in just a minute too
[36:04] anymore i don't like to do my rallying
[36:08] in front of the service i want everybody
[36:09] to laugh and have a good time and then
[36:11] smack you on the rear end as you go out
[36:13] the door in other words by
[36:14] saying words like that brother dale just
[36:17] hammers you on top of the head and then
[36:19] then he preaches to you brother claude
[36:20] said one time he said i know there was
[36:21] some heads hit the floor that day
[36:24] but that's what a pastor is supposed to
[36:25] do thank goodness he's the pastor
[36:29] in whom also we have obtained an
[36:30] inheritance now what we obtained an
[36:33] inheritance brother ray obtained an
[36:35] inheritance
[36:36] and the reason we use him because he
[36:38] just passed away but
[36:39] he obtained that inheritance by the new
[36:41] birth but he has to wait
[36:43] for something else to develop because he
[36:47] had to leave a piece of him here
[36:49] that's why you have dimension that's why
[36:51] god said
[36:53] and i'll get to well i'll do it now you
[36:55] know genesis 1 26
[36:56] what is that that's the new birth
[37:00] that is perfect love that is god's
[37:03] children
[37:04] whatever god saw and said let us make
[37:06] man manner our own image
[37:08] now that couldn't develop it could
[37:10] developed an atom it developed in eve is
[37:12] that a very right same man
[37:13] but that had to be closed up until the
[37:16] day of pentecost
[37:17] then when the first martyr stephen when
[37:20] he was martyred
[37:22] that genesis 1 26 developed in the sixth
[37:24] dimension
[37:26] everybody got that that's right so
[37:28] everything brother louise in that
[37:29] if you say what what's the sixth
[37:31] dimension it's the genesis 126 man
[37:34] that has not come to full maturity
[37:36] because what happened here is
[37:37] god said let us make man our own image
[37:39] in our own likeness
[37:41] and we're going to have a group of
[37:44] children and that group of children is
[37:47] going to develop
[37:49] and they're my children but what
[37:52] happened in the fall
[37:53] that piece of that children those
[37:55] children could not
[37:56] develop because of what adam and eve did
[37:59] so we had to come down here
[38:01] become flesh and have babies bisexual
[38:05] desire
[38:05] but god never did away with this part of
[38:08] genesis 1 26 man
[38:12] he the picture brother brown said god
[38:14] took a picture see now god never took a
[38:16] picture of donnie fall bush
[38:18] at 70 one
[38:21] he said real one
[38:24] that's not what he took if if and i'm
[38:26] saying if for you not for me
[38:28] if brother donny was part of that
[38:30] genesis 1 26 man
[38:31] he never took this picture this picture
[38:35] is not so
[38:36] this picture was never developed in the
[38:39] eternal mind of god
[38:41] that 92 year old woman that received the
[38:43] new birth that he saw
[38:44] in that sixth dimension as a young 20
[38:46] year old woman he never took a picture
[38:48] of her at 90 years old 92 years old
[38:50] he took a picture of her when she got
[38:53] the new birth
[38:56] am i okay with that when she got born
[38:59] again that picture
[39:00] developed the old the old 90 year old
[39:03] woman left
[39:04] died and the new 20 year old moved in
[39:08] they're all right with that that's what
[39:10] happened at your new birth it wasn't
[39:12] just god just
[39:13] well god just lit my soul up no his soul
[39:16] is now your soul your soul is now his
[39:20] soul
[39:21] you and he can't develop an old person
[39:25] that genesis 1 26 man could not develop
[39:28] though it was before the foundation of
[39:30] the world though it was six or eight
[39:32] thousand years ago
[39:33] it was just as fresh today as it was
[39:36] when he spoke it
[39:39] but he knew the plan of redemption was
[39:40] going to have to happen he knew there
[39:42] was going to have to be death
[39:43] burial there was they knew there was
[39:45] going to have to be sorrow and there was
[39:47] going to have to be pain
[39:48] but he was there to heal the people he
[39:50] was there to be the prince of peace but
[39:52] he said i'll just put him right over
[39:53] here
[39:54] yeah you know there was a death angel
[39:58] standing next to brother ray the other
[40:00] night
[40:02] he said you're going with me
[40:06] no you know what spoke that new birth
[40:10] that genesis 1 26 man spoke
[40:13] that little white light brother brown
[40:14] said that little button that you get
[40:16] when you get born again it's like a
[40:17] little button you get in your soul he
[40:19] said
[40:20] that's what spoke the other night and
[40:22] brother ray if you could have heard what
[40:24] he said he said no i'm not going with
[40:25] you he said i know where i am going
[40:27] and you're not going with me because
[40:29] there's no death in there
[40:31] right we said we saw we we when the dead
[40:34] in christ shall rise first well
[40:36] you better be dead tonight you better be
[40:38] dead today
[40:40] if you die a natural death without
[40:41] christ you will not rise again
[40:44] except in the second resurrection which
[40:46] will be down the road
[40:47] then you'll have to give an account of
[40:48] what you do
[40:50] but that's what god did but now listen
[40:52] to this let's go to our first quote
[40:57] only mature christians know these things
[41:02] people have probed all during the all i
[41:05] mean since the beginning of time
[41:07] they probed it where does man go even
[41:09] job not born again job though being
[41:11] having a little prophetic vision he
[41:13] could see
[41:15] the tree die the grass dying all these
[41:18] different things and he could see them
[41:19] come back
[41:20] up every spring just like we do now we
[41:23] see it come back
[41:23] up he said but now man he says i see man
[41:27] go to the ground
[41:29] he said but i don't see man raised back
[41:30] up where does man go
[41:34] oh that you'd hide me lord oh
[41:37] and then all of a sudden he said ah
[41:41] there's a plan because that elihue came
[41:45] to
[41:46] to to job and all them other three spent
[41:48] their time accusing him
[41:50] right his three friends was just
[41:52] accusing him of being everything in the
[41:54] world but that fourth man came up
[41:56] and he said i'm going to speak just a
[41:57] little bit different than the rest of
[41:58] them
[41:59] he said job stand up on your feet quit
[42:01] crying
[42:04] quit crying quit crying let's get some
[42:07] adoption here
[42:08] and then when when now he didn't come to
[42:10] adoption like we do but when he come
[42:11] though to the fullness of his journey
[42:13] he turned around and he said i know my
[42:15] redeemer living
[42:17] and not only the revelation of that i'm
[42:20] going somewhere
[42:22] but i'm going to come back here and in
[42:24] my flesh
[42:26] i'm going to see god i hope the people
[42:28] the message can see that because half of
[42:30] them don't believe that you're going to
[42:31] get that same body back again
[42:33] but what a great miracle that god can
[42:35] take this old kocover
[42:37] and just change the atoms of it i mean
[42:40] that would be really
[42:42] easy though to just throw this one out
[42:44] and as i said before
[42:46] that a lot of people and i heard a
[42:47] preacher preach at one time that you
[42:48] know the bible says walking on the ashes
[42:50] of the wicked well that's because this
[42:52] wicked thing you're gonna walk out on
[42:53] your own ashes
[42:54] i that ain't happening to me
[43:00] god thought enough of me to preserve me
[43:04] as we were as you were reading that hide
[43:06] me in your pavilion
[43:09] until the storm pass brother ray
[43:13] is head i believe that when satan
[43:18] he will be right at your ear if you pass
[43:20] away he's going to be right at your ear
[43:22] saying
[43:22] you ain't going to make it you ain't
[43:24] nothing i got you
[43:25] i'm gonna kill you until until they
[43:28] the dimension gets a little bit faster
[43:32] and then brother ray disappeared
[43:35] and then the devil's running around
[43:36] looking for looking for where to go
[43:40] because there's no kindred spirit
[43:41] there's no connection to that sixth
[43:42] dimension
[43:43] so god is hiding them in their pavilion
[43:47] and i
[43:47] i i didn't say this yesterday but i was
[43:49] thinking about it last night
[43:51] you know we call everybody's name you
[43:53] know i call brother
[43:54] brother eugene collins and we call
[43:56] richard marlow and the different ones
[43:58] brother dick but you know brother
[44:00] brown's there too
[44:03] and as the vision showed they were
[44:05] gathered with him
[44:06] so so brother ray i know there's one
[44:08] thing for sure
[44:10] there was two little men met each other
[44:12] hey man
[44:13] there was two little guys met each other
[44:15] and they were running running around a
[44:16] rock somewhere
[44:18] and brother ray says i know what you
[44:20] mean now
[44:22] this is it see that's real folks that's
[44:25] not a fairy tale
[44:27] that might have been a lot of people
[44:29] yesterday thought we were just idiots
[44:31] and that it's just a fairy tale that
[44:33] this is what we don't know about this
[44:34] afterlife thing we just die and we don't
[44:36] know nothing about it
[44:37] but you and i by this by this prophet
[44:40] coming in the end time and showing us
[44:41] this whole plan
[44:43] and how perfect it is and how complete
[44:47] it is
[44:48] but he's got to have somebody in the end
[44:50] time to speak that though
[44:53] it's not just going to develop by itself
[44:56] the plan needs players hey man you can
[44:59] have the best
[45:00] football plan in the world or the
[45:01] basketball plan or whatever you want to
[45:03] do you
[45:04] can plan that baby out and you can rock
[45:05] your exes and your o's and you can put
[45:07] all this
[45:07] going in this direction but what do you
[45:09] need son
[45:10] you need people you need ball players to
[45:14] watch suit up
[45:17] the plan book learn the playbook
[45:22] so that when it's time to play the game
[45:24] you know what you're talking about
[45:27] brother brown says tell me my brother
[45:28] tell me my sister when was the time that
[45:30] the sons of god
[45:31] was ever to be manifested outside of
[45:34] this time now
[45:36] when were there ever a time in all of
[45:39] history
[45:42] all of history
[45:47] to deliver all nature
[45:51] because brother ray's nature you wonder
[45:54] what i mean the nate
[45:55] what he was born his shell
[45:58] had to stay here because he was born
[46:00] naturally
[46:04] man he was born naturally so that nature
[46:06] of that had to stay here
[46:08] but it's but nature the nature itself is
[46:11] groaning waiting for the time of
[46:12] manifestation
[46:14] why before the atonement was made before
[46:16] the holy ghost was ever poured out
[46:18] before all the old testament on down
[46:20] there couldn't have been manifestation
[46:23] think about that though look at how god
[46:25] took the children of israel
[46:27] what a manifestation they had right
[46:31] what about a god what about a god
[46:35] that knew there was only two people
[46:38] going to make it out of them two million
[46:40] that come out of egypt and he never
[46:42] complained about i mean sure
[46:44] there was a lot of things he did a lot
[46:45] of plagues but he still was like come on
[46:47] let's go
[46:48] i'm gonna make your clothes not wear out
[46:50] i'm gonna make your shoes grow with your
[46:52] body
[46:53] i'm gonna feed you every day you're not
[46:56] if you complain about water i'm going to
[46:58] not just give you a trickle i'm going to
[47:00] give you an artesian well
[47:01] and the thing is going to follow you
[47:07] follow you where's that what well there
[47:10] it is
[47:11] i need some there it is but he knew only
[47:14] two people was going to make it yet god
[47:15] said all right come on
[47:16] when you get in the promised land this
[47:17] is what i want you to do what a great
[47:20] god we serve
[47:22] on down it had to wait till this time
[47:26] now all things has been brought coming
[47:28] shaping up to a headstone to the
[47:30] manifestation
[47:31] of sons of god coming back and the
[47:34] spirit of god coming into these
[47:36] men not one man these
[47:39] men so perfectly until their
[47:42] ministry will be so close
[47:46] like christ who will join him and his
[47:48] church
[47:49] together so what are we under today
[47:52] brothers and sisters we're not
[47:53] under the ministry of
[47:56] presuming right
[48:00] we think when we go to heaven this is
[48:01] going to happen
[48:03] we think there's going to be seven year
[48:05] tribulation
[48:06] we think that father son holy ghost is
[48:08] the right baptism we think there is an
[48:10] eternal hell that's what they're
[48:11] thinking out there
[48:13] because the devil's got them so confused
[48:15] but we're listen
[48:17] when jesus christ was on the earth
[48:20] there was not one thing unpure
[48:24] about his message
[48:28] his message was pure and unadulterated
[48:32] straight to the people that hated him
[48:38] so brother brown says until their
[48:39] ministry will be so close
[48:41] like christ what we know there's no
[48:44] eternal hell we know the correct baptism
[48:47] we know where people
[48:48] go when they die we know where people go
[48:50] when they're dying without christ we
[48:52] know where people
[48:52] we know where god is
[48:58] that's it it's not a hope right
[49:02] we have an assurity yes gloria then if
[49:05] you're born again there's where god is
[49:08] that's right i wrote myself a note
[49:12] you know christ brother brown said
[49:14] christ didn't know jesus christ didn't
[49:16] know all things now christ did
[49:20] oh jesus christ learned by the things he
[49:23] suffered he was made perfect why because
[49:25] he was a human body
[49:26] he was a human being had a human brain
[49:29] but what lived inside of him
[49:31] was not part of christ it was christ
[49:34] amen all of christ and brother brown
[49:37] said then though
[49:37] after the death of our resurrection he
[49:39] knew all things
[49:41] so now since we see that picture develop
[49:44] brother louise we're not looking back at
[49:46] that christ that walked on the shores of
[49:48] galilee
[49:49] and see that he had a human body and it
[49:52] was dying
[49:53] and he didn't know about his second
[49:54] coming that's what the prophet said
[49:57] said moses and elijah on the mountain
[49:59] was telling jesus about his second
[50:00] coming there was things that was
[50:02] withheld from him
[50:04] but now he's out of the tomb
[50:07] amen he's already immortal
[50:10] he's in the seventh dimension he's got
[50:13] an eternal body
[50:14] he knows all things now what's he going
[50:16] to send back on the day of pentecost
[50:17] something that knows just a little bit
[50:20] is he going to sin now though in the end
[50:22] time where the fullness of all things
[50:24] has got to come the headstone himself
[50:26] has got to come you think he's going to
[50:27] leave a piece out
[50:29] that's the problem there was pieces left
[50:32] out during the
[50:33] seven church ages i'm gonna say seven
[50:36] all seven church ages there was things
[50:38] that was left out
[50:40] but now we are living in bible prophecy
[50:44] we are living the bible we are not
[50:46] looking back
[50:48] we're not looking forward brother baby
[50:50] said you need to look at what's going on
[50:51] right now
[50:53] why because bible prophecy is being
[50:55] fulfilled right now
[50:58] today we are living under
[51:02] the fulfillment of bible prophecy
[51:06] but now so is the world
[51:10] so is the world they're living under
[51:12] bible prophecy but they're living under
[51:14] a different prophecy than you are
[51:15] because you are a prophetic being you
[51:17] are able to contact that prophetic god
[51:21] get prophetic insight be able to
[51:24] understand what god's
[51:25] telling you where the world's not going
[51:28] to get that right
[51:29] amen the world is not going to get that
[51:31] prophetic they're going to get the
[51:34] prophecy
[51:36] they're gonna get what's written in this
[51:37] book but so are we
[51:41] but the difference is we're born again
[51:44] and we can't die and god can't judge us
[51:50] we've already been judged but he's going
[51:53] to judge the world by the prophecy that
[51:54] he wrote in this book right here
[51:56] amen so the ministry of jesus christ
[51:58] folks is not coming
[52:00] it's not going to the jews it's right
[52:01] here right you're say yes go
[52:04] let them have their part let's get our
[52:07] part first
[52:10] let's believe that the ministry of jesus
[52:11] christ is here that there is no
[52:14] you say well now yeah and here we go
[52:19] but you go to ministers meeting the
[52:20] first thing people tell you they throw
[52:21] up they say well
[52:22] well they don't throw up but they throw
[52:24] this up to you
[52:26] that sometimes i would like to throw up
[52:28] for some of the things that they say
[52:31] but that don't make me hey man aaron
[52:32] aaron's heard it we've heard it i mean
[52:34] we like
[52:35] what where did you eat that at
[52:39] i'm not going to that restaurant
[52:43] yes come on in type in type not a real
[52:46] restaurant in type
[52:48] where did you eat that at that makes me
[52:52] sick
[52:54] but that's what we're letting somebody
[52:57] has got
[52:58] to preach the pure unadulterated word of
[53:00] god
[53:01] amen right not one word off
[53:04] all right amen
[53:12] is what brother dale said about the five
[53:14] full ministry
[53:16] it's for the what
[53:21] perfecting of the saints not the
[53:25] perfecting of jesus christ he's already
[53:27] perfect
[53:28] but for the perfecting of the saints
[53:30] that we can come to adoption
[53:32] i saw a little snippet in there a few
[53:34] minutes ago brother keith reed you can
[53:35] watch him online
[53:37] and on facebook and i was watching him a
[53:38] few minutes ago but he
[53:40] he was it's not something to come folks
[53:43] it's here this manifestation is here now
[53:48] and and like i said before some people
[53:49] are missing it
[53:52] some me and somebody was talking
[53:53] yesterday some people are literally
[53:55] missing it and sitting right here in the
[53:56] seat
[53:59] and you try and try and try
[54:02] but only god can change you
[54:05] only god can change me but there has got
[54:08] to be
[54:09] i would love for people to begin hunting
[54:14] the truth instead of being i'm talking
[54:17] about you
[54:20] i'm talking about you all of you you
[54:22] need to hunt the truth
[54:25] the truth's not going to come to you
[54:30] you got to have a desire because god
[54:32] will only
[54:33] what he'll only deal with your desire
[54:37] what you desire well i'm fine because
[54:39] i'm in this person's church and he's
[54:42] like the number two people uh on youtube
[54:45] and he's got 800 people in his church
[54:46] he's got to be right
[54:53] i'm not saying one way or the other i'm
[54:55] just saying why do we
[54:56] use those markers
[55:01] where the church of ephesus had 12
[55:03] people in it
[55:04] paul passed away and john took over and
[55:07] pastor tilly was 90 something years old
[55:10] you got a long time left buddy
[55:13] you got a long time left
[55:20] probably toward the end he was just love
[55:23] everybody
[55:24] but you know what he kept his same
[55:27] message though
[55:28] from when that when that man went went
[55:30] over to the isle of patmos and got that
[55:32] revelation
[55:33] the book of revelation he didn't lose
[55:35] that
[55:37] but you know what though he could only
[55:39] tell us about it
[55:41] because there was a part he couldn't
[55:43] write
[55:45] he saw it he was commissioned to write
[55:48] what he saw not to interpret
[55:50] right what he saw he would
[55:53] begin to write the thunders he saw what
[55:56] they were
[55:56] began to write them down and god said
[55:58] nope
[56:00] hold it right there but
[56:03] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[56:05] angel because remember right there in
[56:07] revelations 10 about five it's when he
[56:08] told john not to write
[56:11] then he comes down on in 10 7 and says
[56:13] but in the days of the voice
[56:15] of the seventh angel when he begins to
[56:17] sound his message
[56:19] and his message remember was not in the
[56:21] years of preparation his message was
[56:23] from 63 to 65 opening the seals that no
[56:26] one had ever even looked in part of the
[56:28] book you couldn't even look on the book
[56:29] much look in the much less look in the
[56:31] book
[56:33] and he became heavily unpopular at the
[56:36] time
[56:37] he was very popular before then but
[56:40] after that he became very unpopular
[56:44] so i'm wondering why i don't people
[56:47] money women in popularity why'd brother
[56:50] brown tell us to stay away from those
[56:51] three things
[56:53] because they'll get you every time
[56:55] because the devil's in money the devil's
[56:57] in women and the devil's in popularity
[56:58] and the anointing of the good part of
[57:00] that and the bad part of that's about
[57:02] that far apart
[57:06] you think about that ministers we know
[57:08] that
[57:10] but we're living today in bible prophecy
[57:14] amen everybody all right with that
[57:17] and so we know that the four the four
[57:19] dimensions are light time matter
[57:21] fourth dimension is what we're dealing
[57:23] with as far as radio waves
[57:26] i'm just going to go through this real
[57:27] quick the sixth dimension now
[57:30] brother brown said he went to the fifth
[57:31] dimension and he went to the sixth
[57:33] dimension
[57:34] so he saw both sides of the spectrum the
[57:36] fifth dimension we know what that is
[57:38] that's the center dead that's the ones
[57:39] that go there
[57:40] and i believe according to what i can
[57:43] see of
[57:44] of what brother brown was talking about
[57:46] they don't get any kind of
[57:47] good treatment over there they don't get
[57:49] turned back to a 20 year old
[57:51] they stay their same age and they're
[57:53] hurting and i believe they're not doing
[57:55] going through any kind of
[57:57] bliss like brother ray is going through
[57:58] right now i mean why would you strike
[58:00] why would we strive so much why would we
[58:03] according to revelations 8 why would we
[58:05] groan within ourselves listen do you not
[58:08] groan as you get older you groan anyway
[58:10] oh when you get out of the bed and oh
[58:12] when you get up out of chair
[58:16] trying to make a point but as we get
[58:19] older
[58:19] in god we should groan
[58:24] paul said grown to be clothed with that
[58:27] house
[58:28] not made by hands but revelations eight
[58:31] tells that we're
[58:32] we groan within ourself what that inside
[58:36] person is 20 years old and eternal
[58:39] this outside guy it's like i said it's
[58:41] groaning every day
[58:43] but our groaning should our spiritual
[58:44] groaning should be what
[58:47] i'm not in my right condition right i'm
[58:49] not in my right place
[58:51] this is not how could you take even
[58:54] jesus that he
[58:56] even at the garden of gethsemane brother
[58:58] brown said that's where he really fought
[59:00] it out he didn't fight it out at calvary
[59:04] he fought it out in the garden because
[59:06] the garden is where he said let this cup
[59:08] pass for me
[59:10] he could have turned and said no i don't
[59:12] want to do that right but he fought it
[59:14] out
[59:14] in his humanity but knowing he was
[59:18] eternal god listen
[59:19] they wasn't today they might have been
[59:20] things he didn't know but there's one
[59:22] thing he didn't know he was god
[59:24] right he knew who his daddy was
[59:28] he knew who he was and he didn't have a
[59:32] different personality
[59:35] amen he was the same god
[59:38] but that sixth dimension let's go all
[59:41] the way to number four if you don't mind
[59:42] brothers
[59:44] the countdown now the sixth dimension is
[59:46] christ the saints the dead saints
[59:48] are resting saints who is completely
[59:49] work finished on earth
[59:51] and has entered into rest with christ
[59:53] under the altar
[59:54] beautifully
[59:58] there we go okay now the sixth dimension
[1:00:01] that's where brother ray is that's where
[1:00:02] brother branham is that's where all the
[1:00:04] ones that you saw and what did they
[1:00:06] scream out when
[1:00:08] because brother branham listen brother
[1:00:09] branham was
[1:00:11] i i say confused in his humanity he's
[1:00:14] never it wasn't confused in his doctrine
[1:00:16] because he he said i you got to remember
[1:00:19] when you look at this dream and i
[1:00:21] thought about this the other day
[1:00:23] brother branham sometimes had to pinch
[1:00:25] himself
[1:00:26] remember him he said i had to pinch
[1:00:28] myself whether i was in
[1:00:30] that dimension or this dimension
[1:00:33] everybody got that
[1:00:35] some of y'all have to pinch yourself to
[1:00:37] stay awake in this dimension
[1:00:39] but he had to pinch himself why because
[1:00:43] he was in both worlds
[1:00:46] he was looking at demons flying across
[1:00:48] the congregation
[1:00:49] he said you see that red string i mean
[1:00:51] that black streak going across from that
[1:00:53] person to the other he said that demon
[1:00:54] is screaming to that demon
[1:00:56] over there looking for help because they
[1:00:58] know their form be it's going to be
[1:00:59] exposed how many of y'all have ever
[1:01:01] been yeah you ain't how many of you have
[1:01:05] ever been in a congregation i don't
[1:01:06] want to know what you're thinking about
[1:01:07] me right now but brother brown couldn't
[1:01:10] know every one of your thoughts he said
[1:01:11] hey
[1:01:13] he said i caught that what was he doing
[1:01:16] he was hearing
[1:01:17] literally what they were saying in their
[1:01:19] mind
[1:01:21] but he gets across and he and he steps
[1:01:23] and he says i don't know if it was a
[1:01:24] vision i don't know if it was a dream
[1:01:26] he said but i look back see i believe in
[1:01:28] during his life there was
[1:01:29] never a time that he separated from his
[1:01:32] body
[1:01:33] everybody got that there was a when he
[1:01:36] all the visions he see he was in his
[1:01:38] body his human body but see this one
[1:01:41] he he he either had some kind of
[1:01:43] something happened and he
[1:01:45] he said i was standing there and he said
[1:01:46] i turned and looked and there was my
[1:01:48] body
[1:01:50] he never had that done before so he
[1:01:51] didn't know he said i don't know if
[1:01:52] there's a vision i don't know if it was
[1:01:54] a dream or what but now he was clear
[1:01:57] when he figured out what it was going on
[1:02:00] because when he touched his hair he said
[1:02:02] oh
[1:02:03] i got hair oh oh this is the inside of
[1:02:07] me
[1:02:08] this is this is what i look like when i
[1:02:10] ain't in that
[1:02:11] amen he was in that genesis 126 body
[1:02:16] that was in that old body but god let
[1:02:19] him separate why
[1:02:20] for one purpose not for him now you know
[1:02:24] he said he said now i wondered about it
[1:02:26] and i don't worry about it no more
[1:02:27] see even the prophet of god he thought
[1:02:30] what the old
[1:02:31] the old way of thinking hello brother
[1:02:35] neville
[1:02:36] hello brother tony
[1:02:39] you know he said he passed by he said
[1:02:42] you couldn't shake their hand
[1:02:43] remember that's what he thought
[1:02:46] so god showed it to him but you know
[1:02:48] what god showed it to me and you
[1:02:50] because see i use that example all the
[1:02:51] time even in my own self
[1:02:53] there's a place i'm going to go so what
[1:02:57] fear does that take that takes it now
[1:02:58] the little bit of fear of death walking
[1:02:59] down the valley of the shadow of death
[1:03:01] but there's a light
[1:03:02] there knowing that i'm born again
[1:03:05] doesn't matter if i fall dead
[1:03:06] the next two seconds i'm gonna be
[1:03:09] standing with brother ray in them in
[1:03:10] eternal body waiting to come back here
[1:03:16] because even they told them they said we
[1:03:17] don't eat here
[1:03:19] right that's right they were telling him
[1:03:21] look we don't eat here
[1:03:22] we don't drink water here but we're
[1:03:24] waiting to go back and get our human
[1:03:28] body
[1:03:30] oh why can't people read that even in
[1:03:32] the message
[1:03:33] i mean if you were just going to get a
[1:03:35] boom get a new body just
[1:03:37] boom get it right there but they told
[1:03:40] brother adam
[1:03:41] we got to come back and pick up our body
[1:03:44] because we don't eat your theophany
[1:03:46] doesn't eat but your body does
[1:03:51] that's why they're not going to be
[1:03:52] complete without me and you
[1:03:55] not going to be complete without us
[1:03:57] because they're
[1:03:59] part of their being is still right here
[1:04:01] part of their natural world
[1:04:03] is right here and i'll cover that in
[1:04:05] just a minute i don't want to go through
[1:04:06] paradise again we've never been through
[1:04:07] that
[1:04:08] let's go to perfect love let's go to
[1:04:10] number six
[1:04:16] where's this perfect love i'll
[1:04:18] coordinate i believe i was caught in the
[1:04:20] sixth dimension looking back down
[1:04:21] here and could see back
[1:04:24] the sight isn't exactly with the eyes
[1:04:26] that's earthly but sight is a greater
[1:04:28] thing than the sight that you have there
[1:04:31] their contact is far beyond any contact
[1:04:33] that our natural senses
[1:04:35] would contact and remember number seven
[1:04:38] he talks about being perfect love
[1:04:40] now look at number eight let's read this
[1:04:42] one because i want to bring out this
[1:04:44] point
[1:04:46] i was thinking about yesterday and i
[1:04:47] added it in last night
[1:04:49] or just a few minutes ago the first is
[1:04:51] perfect love let's go to number seven
[1:04:53] i mean number eight i'm sorry the first
[1:04:55] is perfect love that's god's love
[1:04:57] pure and unadulterated the next comes in
[1:04:59] there is filial love
[1:05:01] see the philio love had to develop
[1:05:04] when adam and eve when adam said she's
[1:05:06] blowing my bone and flesh and my flesh
[1:05:08] now listen
[1:05:09] that was agape love speaking
[1:05:13] because they had the same theophany
[1:05:17] right she was in him just separated the
[1:05:20] feminist part out right
[1:05:22] so they too were truly one but see
[1:05:25] that's never going to happen again
[1:05:27] naturally because of what they did there
[1:05:30] was another seed injected in there
[1:05:32] that was not supposed to be there so now
[1:05:35] you've got the genesis 1 26
[1:05:36] man though even though june or myself or
[1:05:40] brother ray and sister kathy lived
[1:05:41] 40-something years together they never
[1:05:43] were a complete one person
[1:05:45] but brother ray is over in another
[1:05:48] dimension
[1:05:49] and he is in his condition of
[1:05:52] perfection but watch this the first is
[1:05:55] perfect love that's god's love pure and
[1:05:57] unadulterated the next comes and there's
[1:05:58] filial love that's love that you have
[1:06:00] for your wife
[1:06:01] and your children but now you have to be
[1:06:03] careful now
[1:06:04] bob or louise or somebody or aaron
[1:06:07] you all need to preach on this okay
[1:06:11] no there's dif even filial though
[1:06:13] there's different love past fellow love
[1:06:14] because i don't have
[1:06:15] the same filial love i have for june i
[1:06:17] can't have for my granddaughter
[1:06:19] that's perverted but it is filial love
[1:06:22] it is a
[1:06:23] listen filial love is a temporary love
[1:06:28] it's not eternal filial love was given
[1:06:32] to man because you go down to eros and
[1:06:35] you go to lust and all the different
[1:06:36] other things
[1:06:37] and a lot of that has to do with our
[1:06:39] human being part of us
[1:06:41] to procreate with everybody got that
[1:06:45] but filial love is temporary it was
[1:06:47] given to us in this dimension because
[1:06:50] here was my here's my point let me write
[1:06:52] my note you cannot take
[1:06:54] filial love over there
[1:07:00] you can't take your filial even though
[1:07:02] brother i love sister kathy
[1:07:05] you may prove it brother branham said
[1:07:08] here comes my first
[1:07:10] wife
[1:07:13] hope died when she was about 20 years
[1:07:16] old
[1:07:17] right said oh i knew she was just going
[1:07:19] to come up and say hey
[1:07:21] husband god bless you he said she hugged
[1:07:25] my neck and said my precious brother and
[1:07:26] walked off
[1:07:28] why he loved her with felio love in
[1:07:31] this dimension but when she passed into
[1:07:34] that other dimension feel your love went
[1:07:36] away
[1:07:38] that's why brother brown said that
[1:07:39] jealousy there's no jealousy there's no
[1:07:41] see there's no jealousy in agape love
[1:07:43] there's no it's jealousy and filial love
[1:07:45] and all the other kinds of love but
[1:07:47] there's none of that but you can't take
[1:07:49] that
[1:07:50] only agape love what brother brown said
[1:07:52] only perfect
[1:07:53] love will be there
[1:07:57] but now listen let me bring a point to
[1:08:00] you
[1:08:01] there is a time though that brother
[1:08:04] branham pulls and brings in another
[1:08:06] vision that he had
[1:08:09] am i okay with this now remember he's
[1:08:12] looking at this vision in 1960
[1:08:14] his wife's passed away he didn't see his
[1:08:16] new wife so she was because she wasn't
[1:08:18] dead yet
[1:08:19] i've had people preach and said well
[1:08:21] everybody was there well he didn't say
[1:08:22] he saw meaty
[1:08:26] he didn't say he saw bill down he didn't
[1:08:28] say he saw all the ones that were still
[1:08:30] alive
[1:08:30] he saw the ones that had went on from
[1:08:32] that point back
[1:08:34] everybody got that amen thank god
[1:08:37] because you know a lot of people now
[1:08:39] here we go again a lot of them old
[1:08:40] people said
[1:08:41] brother branham said he saw me and he
[1:08:43] did he says it on the tape he said i saw
[1:08:45] y'all there or i saw you there
[1:08:49] he didn't see them he saw the people of
[1:08:53] his message there
[1:08:54] at that time because the people there
[1:08:56] were still sitting there their theophany
[1:08:58] was right there
[1:09:00] it wasn't over there in here at the same
[1:09:02] place amen
[1:09:04] but sister hope comes across though says
[1:09:07] my precious brother and walks off now
[1:09:09] brother branham knows that was his wife
[1:09:12] because he's still connected back to the
[1:09:13] filial little body that's laying on the
[1:09:15] on the bed i hope this will help you
[1:09:18] something because it helped me
[1:09:20] but now watch now they are not
[1:09:23] totally complete without us
[1:09:27] pay attention just for a minute i'll
[1:09:28] just quit right here we won't do this no
[1:09:29] more we'll stop right here
[1:09:32] there is perfect love but now somewhere
[1:09:36] when they come
[1:09:37] back and pick up this body
[1:09:41] and it's redeemed brother branham has
[1:09:45] another vision
[1:09:47] of getting his reward remember he said
[1:09:50] he feels one grab him on the arm on this
[1:09:53] side
[1:09:54] and one grab him on the arm on this side
[1:09:57] and he said i knew and they knew we had
[1:09:59] been married in the previous life
[1:10:01] and we walk up the steps to get my
[1:10:04] reward with hope
[1:10:06] and media knowing that they were husband
[1:10:08] and wife
[1:10:10] in this time somewhere they picked up
[1:10:12] something
[1:10:15] if you'll read who is this melchizedek
[1:10:17] brother brown tell you
[1:10:19] there's a spirit part of you that's
[1:10:20] withholding somewhere
[1:10:22] because he said the soul will connect
[1:10:24] with the spirit and then connect with
[1:10:25] the body
[1:10:27] see when they're across the curtain of
[1:10:29] time hope was in her theophany she did
[1:10:30] not have that natural spirit that had
[1:10:32] that natural love for william branham
[1:10:34] or she would have identified him when
[1:10:36] she was there
[1:10:37] but when she comes and picks up her body
[1:10:40] that spirit has got to come back on them
[1:10:42] because brother brown said you're not
[1:10:44] going to be husband and wife over there
[1:10:45] but you know you
[1:10:46] were husband and wife here well
[1:10:48] something changed
[1:10:52] we're going to know it but
[1:10:58] thank god for this revelation it makes
[1:11:01] the whole plan so plain
[1:11:03] and you don't have to worry well because
[1:11:06] look if you take that
[1:11:07] that's what i was thinking i love my
[1:11:10] wife and you love your wife
[1:11:12] you love your husband you give your life
[1:11:14] for them
[1:11:15] and if they're born again that's good
[1:11:19] but if you take that one situation in
[1:11:22] 1960
[1:11:24] i'd be a little bit disappointed
[1:11:27] if i went across a curtain of time and
[1:11:30] there i saw june
[1:11:33] and she just comes up and says oh my
[1:11:34] precious brother i walks off
[1:11:37] i'd be like
[1:11:41] i mean really think about it but then
[1:11:43] you see the next
[1:11:45] the next vision or not the next very
[1:11:47] next vision but he sees the other vision
[1:11:49] that clarifies the whole thing because
[1:11:52] he said we're
[1:11:53] see he's already they're already in the
[1:11:55] glorified body they're getting ready to
[1:11:56] go up and get his reward
[1:11:58] whatever that reward is but he there's
[1:12:01] hope
[1:12:01] he said there's media he said remember
[1:12:03] he said i always wondered he said hope
[1:12:05] was a little jealous remember that look
[1:12:08] it up
[1:12:09] hope was a little bit jealous i was
[1:12:11] wondering when she grabbed one arm
[1:12:13] and hear me because see they knew each
[1:12:14] other on earth right
[1:12:17] because as soon as she died he wasn't
[1:12:18] very long until he married
[1:12:20] married sister him
[1:12:23] but all the jealousy was gone but they
[1:12:25] had picked up a spiritual part of them
[1:12:28] that could remember what happened on
[1:12:29] earth see that brought the plan together
[1:12:32] so now i know
[1:12:34] that i'll be connected with june for an
[1:12:37] eternity
[1:12:38] and see that makes me happy now i don't
[1:12:41] have to go running after him no more
[1:12:42] [Applause]
[1:12:45] same way with you godly man godly wife
[1:12:50] you're there for an eternity your filial
[1:12:54] love
[1:12:55] though has nothing to do with that new
[1:12:59] birth
[1:13:01] i read it before brother brown says that
[1:13:03] you can love
[1:13:05] with your spirit and not love god
[1:13:10] you can love god with your spirit and
[1:13:12] not have your soul be just as black as
[1:13:14] such
[1:13:16] so you better be careful
[1:13:19] now look on the other end of the
[1:13:21] spectrum there's a lot of people
[1:13:24] that's going to live their whole life
[1:13:27] married never born again
[1:13:30] and that's just going to go away
[1:13:35] you say that's cruel no it's not cruel
[1:13:37] they got the same opportunity you do
[1:13:39] that's not cruel that's god being a
[1:13:44] judge
[1:13:46] but think about what god given me and
[1:13:47] you folks if you give you a godly wife
[1:13:50] or he gave you a godly husband
[1:13:52] oh come on amen
[1:13:56] becca think about it
[1:14:00] margaret's going to be there might have
[1:14:02] been a little bit of jealousy but
[1:14:04] not over there
[1:14:07] not over there no it'll be a perfect
[1:14:11] bliss that you'll never
[1:14:12] even worry about what that so much went
[1:14:15] on down here because all that you know
[1:14:17] the bible tells us that the former
[1:14:18] things will be passed away behold all
[1:14:20] things have become new
[1:14:21] now listen you say well now the former
[1:14:23] things will be done i won't know what i
[1:14:24] didn't know you're going to know what
[1:14:25] you did down here
[1:14:27] cause you're gonna have a testimony just
[1:14:29] like our sisters you're gonna have
[1:14:30] testimony
[1:14:32] your testimony is what's gonna go with
[1:14:34] you because that 90-year-old woman she
[1:14:36] still had her testimony even in her
[1:14:38] theophany
[1:14:41] she said you're a great leader we were
[1:14:43] waiting on you to get here
[1:14:44] right we're going to go back and get our
[1:14:46] bodies and then we're going to come back
[1:14:48] god's
[1:14:48] uh jesus is going to come and get you
[1:14:50] she was preaching to the prophet
[1:14:53] this 90 year old woman but she was in
[1:14:57] her theophany
[1:14:59] amen the genesis 1 26
[1:15:04] was and is perfect love
[1:15:08] and it was situated in god's mind before
[1:15:12] the foundation of the world
[1:15:13] a piece of god that no one else can get
[1:15:15] to satan can't find it
[1:15:18] satan can't be a part of it nobody can
[1:15:20] be a part of it but his bride the ones
[1:15:22] that he saw
[1:15:24] that he saw that took it
[1:15:28] and lived it let me read
[1:15:31] quote number 14 you can't love with your
[1:15:34] body
[1:15:35] you love with your spirit that's one of
[1:15:38] the endless and you can love and even
[1:15:40] love god and still not be right
[1:15:46] listen that's why that's why you have to
[1:15:48] realize what brother brown was talking
[1:15:50] about he said
[1:15:50] he said you can have the baptism
[1:15:54] of the holy ghost watch his terminology
[1:15:57] on your spirit every day of your life
[1:16:01] and die and go to hell
[1:16:04] but you can't have the new birth and die
[1:16:07] and go to hell
[1:16:10] they're so close but they're so far
[1:16:12] apart right
[1:16:13] because you can be at what what's
[1:16:15] anointed ones they're anointed by the
[1:16:16] true genuine holy ghost but they've
[1:16:20] never had an
[1:16:21] intimate they've never had a agape love
[1:16:25] with god almighty they've just took what
[1:16:28] the filial love is
[1:16:30] and made it tried to make it agape love
[1:16:35] brother brown said in quote number 15 he
[1:16:36] said real genuine love will create a
[1:16:39] confidence
[1:16:40] in his word right
[1:16:43] you don't put your listen i don't put my
[1:16:45] confidence in that june loves me and
[1:16:48] that's going to put me in heaven
[1:16:50] my confidence is that god loves me
[1:16:54] that god loved me and i'm loving him
[1:16:55] back and that's what's going to put me
[1:16:56] into heaven
[1:16:57] amen real genuine love will create a
[1:17:01] confidence
[1:17:02] in his word let me read this we won't
[1:17:04] get to the chart sister julie hang on to
[1:17:05] that chart
[1:17:07] thank you she's gotten him because we'll
[1:17:09] get to it next time is that all right
[1:17:10] well i want to read these quotes and
[1:17:12] we'll be done
[1:17:14] position of a believer in 1955 listen to
[1:17:16] this
[1:17:18] under the law under the shadows they
[1:17:20] entered in under the shedding of the
[1:17:21] blood of goats and bolts
[1:17:23] which we went through which could not
[1:17:25] take away sin
[1:17:26] it was the life of an animal how could
[1:17:30] the life
[1:17:30] and spirit of a dead animal coming out
[1:17:33] of the blood of life
[1:17:35] the cell of life breaking forth the
[1:17:37] blood that was shed
[1:17:39] ever that life ever returned back into
[1:17:41] an animal
[1:17:44] in other words it can't come into you it
[1:17:47] can't even go back into another animal
[1:17:50] but watch this this is the part that i'd
[1:17:53] read and it just really
[1:17:56] makes you think what god did for us
[1:17:58] listen to this
[1:18:01] or to a man the life of a lamb of a
[1:18:04] heifer of a goat or an animal that's
[1:18:06] been sacrificed after the blood has been
[1:18:08] broken
[1:18:09] for our sins that's why it never returns
[1:18:12] back and having anything to do with a
[1:18:14] human being it could not watch this
[1:18:16] but god before the foundation of the
[1:18:18] world
[1:18:20] foreordained that jesus would come the
[1:18:22] perfect
[1:18:23] lamb of god into a perfect cell that god
[1:18:27] created himself or god create god
[1:18:30] himself created look
[1:18:32] to bring blood into the world
[1:18:36] to bring blood into the world human
[1:18:39] blood
[1:18:40] but the blood of almighty god to bring
[1:18:43] blood into the world to offer that blood
[1:18:46] yes amen amen and if you turn that down
[1:18:49] in this hour
[1:18:51] i love that to that center that was in
[1:18:52] that blood cell with his love
[1:18:56] that was the love of god is that he made
[1:18:59] himself a human being
[1:19:01] he made himself a blood cell that
[1:19:04] not only he could die for you but he
[1:19:07] could come back and get inside of you
[1:19:10] with that love and the holy ghost
[1:19:11] himself after that offering of that man
[1:19:13] can come back and possess a believer he
[1:19:16] bought eternal
[1:19:17] redemption now did you get that now see
[1:19:20] through the blood
[1:19:21] washing of the blood taking away
[1:19:22] separating of sin that the holy spirit
[1:19:24] lose the believer
[1:19:26] through the blood cleansing of the soul
[1:19:29] into fellowship into this spirit life
[1:19:33] inside with christ shut out with the
[1:19:35] world and look
[1:19:37] very nature of god is in you
[1:19:40] still subject to mistakes but god can't
[1:19:43] see it
[1:19:45] how many of you is carrying mistakes
[1:19:48] today
[1:19:50] why
[1:19:54] come on i'll ask you one more time why
[1:19:59] why
[1:20:02] because it's covered by the blood god
[1:20:04] can't see it
[1:20:06] god can't see through the blood every
[1:20:09] time he looks through the blood it looks
[1:20:11] white
[1:20:12] he looks through the blood it looks
[1:20:13] white so if god was so pleased with
[1:20:15] christ
[1:20:16] till he accepted him and said this is my
[1:20:18] beloved son in whom i'm well pleased
[1:20:21] and through christ being the perfect one
[1:20:23] us dead to our own thoughts and ideas
[1:20:26] being born of the spirit of god walking
[1:20:28] not after
[1:20:29] theology or hope
[1:20:32] or maybe so but after the spirit inside
[1:20:36] of us
[1:20:37] then let the dead in christ walk not
[1:20:40] after the things of the world i've been
[1:20:41] telling y'all for years
[1:20:43] the dead in christ is not the
[1:20:46] brother ray over there
[1:20:51] you died here right amen after the
[1:20:54] spirit said let the dead in christ
[1:20:56] walk not after the things of the world
[1:20:58] but after the things of the spirit
[1:21:00] romans 8 1 says there is therefore now
[1:21:02] no condemnation
[1:21:04] to them that are in christ jesus look
[1:21:06] though that walk not after the flesh
[1:21:08] fighting war strife envying selfish
[1:21:11] things but after
[1:21:12] the spirit a couple more listen to this
[1:21:16] hebrew series 1957
[1:21:20] neither by the blood of goats calves but
[1:21:22] by his own blood he entered him once
[1:21:24] into the holy place this is where we've
[1:21:25] been reading
[1:21:26] having obtained eternal redemption do
[1:21:28] you get it
[1:21:29] eternal redemption for us not to be
[1:21:32] redeemed today
[1:21:33] and then next week when the revival
[1:21:35] starts be redeemed again
[1:21:39] and then oh we backslide and be redeemed
[1:21:42] again
[1:21:44] you're redeemed once forever
[1:21:48] that's right no more redeemed redeemed
[1:21:50] redeemed
[1:21:51] eternal redemption he that heareth my
[1:21:54] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:21:56] has eternal life and shall never come to
[1:21:58] the judgment but hath
[1:22:00] past tense past from death and to life
[1:22:03] because he was shook
[1:22:05] because he was baptized a certain way
[1:22:08] because he had blood in his hand
[1:22:10] because he has believed on scroll up
[1:22:12] please
[1:22:16] well because he has believed on the only
[1:22:18] begotten son of god look
[1:22:19] that's how we have eternal redemption
[1:22:23] listen to this fellowship 1960.
[1:22:27] talk about a super sign he could have
[1:22:29] come an
[1:22:30] angel if he wanted to he kind of could
[1:22:32] have come a full mature man
[1:22:35] but a baby over a pile of manure crying
[1:22:39] talk about a super sign
[1:22:40] that's real super sign a baby jehovah
[1:22:43] crying as a baby
[1:22:44] a super sign oh my then people saying
[1:22:47] he's just a prophet oh my the super sign
[1:22:49] jehovah is a boy playing jehovah a man
[1:22:51] twirling in carpenter shop
[1:22:53] jehovah himself made flesh and dwelt
[1:22:55] among us stretched his tent down here
[1:22:57] made himself a body to live in
[1:22:59] to have a blood cell
[1:23:02] to have a human blood cell but inside of
[1:23:05] that blood cell
[1:23:06] was not just normal human life that was
[1:23:09] eternal life
[1:23:13] to have a blood cell that that blood
[1:23:15] cell could be broken hallelujah
[1:23:17] that was the lamb of god that was slain
[1:23:19] from the foundation of the world that
[1:23:20] brings
[1:23:21] us eternal redemption the bible said so
[1:23:25] it brought us eternal redemption we are
[1:23:28] purchased
[1:23:29] by the precious blood of jesus christ
[1:23:30] which has given us
[1:23:32] eternal life how do you do it i don't
[1:23:35] know
[1:23:38] i believe he did but you know what i
[1:23:41] mean
[1:23:45] let's stand our feet musicians come
[1:23:49] and that's what we're going to get to on
[1:23:50] a chart where jesus comes on earth as a
[1:23:51] human being he had to come as a human
[1:23:53] mortal man
[1:23:55] he had to come with a with a with
[1:23:57] humanity he had to be part of us he had
[1:23:59] to be
[1:24:00] our brother but now remember
[1:24:04] he wasn't sinful he took on mine in your
[1:24:08] sin
[1:24:10] you say brother wait that's elementary
[1:24:12] have you ever really looked at that
[1:24:13] quote though that i just read you
[1:24:16] he had to create a blood cell
[1:24:20] and it had to have eternal life in it to
[1:24:22] begin with amen
[1:24:24] listen jesus christ didn't develop
[1:24:26] eternal life as he got older
[1:24:30] jesus christ didn't need a new birth
[1:24:33] he told nicodemus he said nicodemus you
[1:24:35] born different than me
[1:24:36] you need a new birth you need to be born
[1:24:39] again
[1:24:39] nicodemus says
[1:24:42] i got to go back and get in my mama's
[1:24:44] womb and no it just went right over his
[1:24:46] head
[1:24:47] but you and i we know what we got to do
[1:24:53] if you're not part of that perfect love
[1:24:56] then you do have a fearful time
[1:25:02] because perfect love casts out fear
[1:25:05] let's sing a song
[1:25:09] 319 let's worship god
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:38] is
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:47] that gives me strength from day to day
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:26:06] is
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:20] valley
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:31] it will never lose
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:48] is
[1:26:50] [Music]
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:27:16] it's going to carry us from here all the
[1:27:18] way into glory
[1:27:21] doesn't matter where you go you can't be
[1:27:24] once you get covered by the blood you
[1:27:26] can't get uncovered
[1:27:27] there's no way there's no way you can
[1:27:30] get uncovered
[1:27:32] you're covered by what
[1:27:35] agape love we still have to live in
[1:27:38] filial love you know that
[1:27:39] you know that and i know that but the
[1:27:41] love of god's got to take over sometime
[1:27:45] because it'll never lose its power and
[1:27:47] he created a blood cell
[1:27:49] and came down here on earth to die for
[1:27:51] me and you
[1:27:52] that's elementary but if we ever lose
[1:27:54] that in the beginning of our
[1:27:56] christianity don't you ever lose that
[1:27:59] what jesus christ did for you don't ever
[1:28:02] forget that
[1:28:03] we sure we've got the greatest message
[1:28:05] since since jesus christ walked on the
[1:28:07] face of the earth
[1:28:08] right greatest message but we still got
[1:28:11] to remember
[1:28:12] jesus christ is the message jesus christ
[1:28:16] died on a cross so that you and i could
[1:28:19] see this plan
[1:28:20] and see it made manifest in a group of
[1:28:22] people
[1:28:24] amen amen let's hang on the map
[1:28:27] [Music]
[1:28:29] you know i was looking the other day
[1:28:33] and i'm talking to everybody here i hope
[1:28:35] everybody can hear me downstairs
[1:28:38] but sometimes you know
[1:28:41] dale's asked y'all many many times about
[1:28:46] how many times it your kids go to the
[1:28:49] bathroom and
[1:28:50] how many disrupt services and terrence
[1:28:52] has said the same thing
[1:28:55] well from this day forward we're going
[1:28:57] to try something different
[1:29:00] i read a quote right here for brother
[1:29:01] brown was talking about that woman that
[1:29:03] fixed herself up she got ready to
[1:29:06] prophesy
[1:29:08] and he saw her getting ready let me read
[1:29:11] you he said she jumped up
[1:29:13] i said sit down she started on i said
[1:29:17] sit down
[1:29:19] and boy everybody i just stopped she
[1:29:21] acted like she didn't hear me she said i
[1:29:22] squealed it out
[1:29:24] sit down she heard it that time
[1:29:27] so if your parents can't take care of
[1:29:29] your kids if they go out of this
[1:29:31] sanctuary over one time from now on and
[1:29:33] i'm preaching
[1:29:34] i'm gonna make them sit down you got it
[1:29:38] if you're mad with that then you talk to
[1:29:40] god about it because
[1:29:42] i can keep reading on down here where
[1:29:43] brother brown says you grieve the holy
[1:29:44] spirit
[1:29:45] right right by not doing what god said
[1:29:49] now listen an older person but i tell
[1:29:51] you what i had
[1:29:52] i had a little trouble with my kidneys
[1:29:54] and i but i would drink coffee
[1:29:56] before second service i quit drinking
[1:29:58] coffee for a second service
[1:30:00] and i don't have to go to the bathroom i
[1:30:02] quit drinking coffee in church
[1:30:04] before first service so i'd make sure
[1:30:06] that my bladder's empty
[1:30:09] you say well boy you're being no i'm not
[1:30:11] you've been told
[1:30:14] you've been told and told and told well
[1:30:16] they can do what they want to do
[1:30:17] but when i'm preaching up here in second
[1:30:19] service if your kid gets up over one
[1:30:21] time and goes to the bathroom
[1:30:23] you're going to hear me say the same
[1:30:24] thing right here if you get mad at it
[1:30:29] the prophet said you grieve the holy
[1:30:31] spirit he didn't grieve it by screaming
[1:30:33] at him you grieved it by not doing what
[1:30:35] god said
[1:30:38] now older people i can understand if we
[1:30:40] our bladder gets a little
[1:30:41] weak when we get older but now young
[1:30:43] kids no
[1:30:45] i ain't having it i there is no excuse
[1:30:48] right not one right you go to the
[1:30:50] bathroom one time
[1:30:52] you better not go again in my service i
[1:30:55] will sit you down
[1:30:57] you everybody got that okay
[1:31:00] that's why i want to do it at the end of
[1:31:02] the service god bless now listen
[1:31:04] listen i we are human beings but this
[1:31:08] thing's getting serious
[1:31:10] brother branham says right here let me
[1:31:11] read this one thing right here says
[1:31:13] sister
[1:31:15] but you was given the wrong message
[1:31:17] sister watch this right here
[1:31:20] he said there's one thing wrong with you
[1:31:21] either you were in the flesh or you've
[1:31:23] got a wrong pastor that trains you that
[1:31:25] don't know nothing about scripture
[1:31:28] listen to this she done it three nights
[1:31:31] in a row
[1:31:32] he said that's wrong you're out of order
[1:31:35] you lost
[1:31:36] many souls night before last and many
[1:31:39] last night again
[1:31:40] and you've done it the same thing
[1:31:42] tonight
[1:31:44] she was responsible now she got up she
[1:31:47] spoke in tongues brother brown said that
[1:31:49] could have been of the holy spirit
[1:31:50] he said but she was out of order
[1:31:53] she's out order you lost
[1:31:56] many souls not before last and many
[1:31:59] souls last night again
[1:32:01] and you've done it the same thing
[1:32:02] tonight brother braddon i beg your
[1:32:04] pardon the preacher says
[1:32:06] i said what do you mean he said she had
[1:32:07] a right to give that message
[1:32:09] he said i was on the platform and the
[1:32:10] spirit of the prophet is subject to the
[1:32:12] prophets
[1:32:13] i'm still in the platform i have the
[1:32:16] message
[1:32:20] so that's what's going to happen from
[1:32:21] now on if you can't set them down
[1:32:24] i will that's right anybody good with
[1:32:26] that
[1:32:27] man that's the way it's gonna happen
[1:32:28] from now on to me anyway
[1:32:30] if brother brown can say sit down and
[1:32:33] and uh
[1:32:34] be in line then i believe i'll be able
[1:32:36] to do the same thing everybody
[1:32:38] understand that am i clear
[1:32:40] [Applause]
[1:32:45] if you're sick that's a different story
[1:32:48] but two or three times in the service
[1:32:50] you need to come up here
[1:32:52] yeah instead of going back under you
[1:32:53] need to come up here we'll pray for you
[1:32:55] and then you go do what you need to do
[1:32:56] but you can't be getting up in and out
[1:32:58] of service all the time and it used to
[1:33:00] not bother me but it bothers me now
[1:33:02] i lose my train of thought i'm getting
[1:33:03] older i was brother dale he just
[1:33:05] plowed right on i guess but i can't do
[1:33:08] that
[1:33:10] but and you know what if you grieve the
[1:33:12] holy spirit then it's your problem it's
[1:33:13] not mine
[1:33:15] okay i love you with love lord i love
[1:33:18] you with a gothic love
[1:33:19] you may be hating me with filial level
[1:33:21] right now but
[1:33:24] like brother dale said look we're not
[1:33:26] preaching to your to your spirit
[1:33:29] we're preaching to your soul we want
[1:33:31] your soul to be right
[1:33:33] if your soul's not right then let's get
[1:33:35] it right
[1:33:37] i want us to move on what if
[1:33:40] brother branham said one child running
[1:33:43] through the building before the next
[1:33:45] service can disrupt the whole he didn't
[1:33:46] say a little bit
[1:33:48] he said disrupt the whole second service
[1:33:51] why the holy spirit's in here
[1:33:54] you say no no we're out the door
[1:33:59] the holy spirit's here the devil's here
[1:34:01] too
[1:34:02] so why can't the holy spirit be here
[1:34:04] this is his house
[1:34:06] amen let's buy our heads the only father
[1:34:09] thank you for this day you give us
[1:34:12] lord we're just trying to prepare
[1:34:13] ourselves for this last push
[1:34:16] i believe that we're right on the brink
[1:34:18] of something so
[1:34:21] wonderfully supernatural that the world
[1:34:24] is going to have to bend and break
[1:34:26] from the power that is given out by the
[1:34:29] bride of jesus christ
[1:34:32] if we're groaning lord that means the
[1:34:34] world is groaning
[1:34:36] we see tornadoes and tsunamis and
[1:34:38] earthquakes and
[1:34:40] several volcanoes they said is just
[1:34:41] right now on the brink of exploding
[1:34:43] there in mexico
[1:34:45] and wipe out 10 million people if they
[1:34:47] both blow up at one time lord this whole
[1:34:49] world
[1:34:50] is screaming for the bride to come to
[1:34:52] perfection
[1:34:54] they're screaming for the manifestation
[1:34:55] of the sons of god where a man can walk
[1:34:57] out on his porch
[1:34:59] and say peace be still and the storm go
[1:35:02] away
[1:35:04] or as the prophet did with the bull and
[1:35:06] different animals lord we saw for a
[1:35:07] moment but brother branham told us
[1:35:10] lord he said what you see in part
[1:35:14] you're gonna see in its fullness
[1:35:18] it'll be like popcorn popping fireworks
[1:35:20] going off in the church but we can't do
[1:35:22] that with little sin and little things
[1:35:24] in our life
[1:35:25] that we can't get right but lord you can
[1:35:29] make it right for us if we'll just
[1:35:31] do as brother trevor said just get on
[1:35:33] our knees sometime
[1:35:35] humble ourself before you lord not just
[1:35:38] lay in the bed or sit in a chair and
[1:35:39] pray like we always do and i do the same
[1:35:41] thing at night in the bed
[1:35:43] but let's hit our knees every once in a
[1:35:44] while let's
[1:35:46] raise our hands as as the eagles
[1:35:49] that we are we need to raise those two
[1:35:51] wings up and say papa
[1:35:53] come take us home
[1:35:56] if we're too satisfied with this world
[1:35:58] lord we don't have you inside of us
[1:36:01] but lord by the power of the holy ghost
[1:36:05] we're going to leave this world and
[1:36:07] we're going to get out of here and we're
[1:36:09] going to go we're going to see brother
