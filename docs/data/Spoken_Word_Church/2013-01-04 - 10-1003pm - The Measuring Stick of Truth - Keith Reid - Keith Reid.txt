little church in saint thomas certainly has grown over the years and um you know the ones that has been baptized i say it like this always that you've got a part in those souls that have you know come to the lord out of that experience and so we certainly thank god for that receiving we would like to turn our bibles to the book of said look let me just write to god we would say something here amen certainly haven't got a lot to say that you have never heard before amen praise god but you know to each god has given a portion amen certainly and um it's hard for us to ever think in our little corner that we've got you know all that we have need of for god has given us a fight for ministry to bring forth his word amen i'd like to read from luke chapter four let me read from verse 14. and it says that jesus returning in the power of the spirit into galilee and they went out of fame of him through all the regions wrote about and he taught in their synagogue been glorified of all and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet azza and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken heart and to preach deliverance to the captives and to the recov and recovering of the sight of the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again unto the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he begin to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your years and all bear him witness and wondered are the gracious words which proceed out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph son may the lord that is blessing to the world maybe just by heads everywhere almighty god and our father lord for many times and in many season oh god these scriptures have been read like it was read back that day and oh father many things have been said on the word and lord as a light has shown god but father we pray the sibling lord just one more time would you take our bodies or lips and they hear that hero god and lord god may you be glorified by your own word heavenly father we pray that your anointing of the holy spirit oh god will come in our midst and lord god not just the anointing but truth or god may proceed out of our mouth as it proceed when he met the word that was on the paper becomes alive that day just bless us now as we look to you believing in jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated i'd like to say speak this evening on the measuring stick of truth you know when jesus was before pilot pilot asks a question what is truth uh i say many times that you know we might look at truth as a concept something to be uh looked into or you know it is something that a word that we could find its meaning and explain and expound on it really well jesus one time he said i am the truth hallelujah and so we look at truth not just amen as a concept but truth as a person amen you know as we look at this in the word of god and we find that to the message and you know just look at this in a particular way this evening you know when we measure something you know somebody might says uh you you speak of somebody you said well is he short or is he tall and you know my wife might say about me well my husband is a very tall person but that is because she's a very short person and and so you know so she looks up and everything she sees above her she said well he's stall and and you know you said about my wife i said well she's a very short woman because i'm keep looking down but that is not measurement that is just a concept so you say no oh tall exactly are you and so you get a measuring stick and you measure it right you know you've got something in weight and you said well well i've got a whole leap and i said how much exactly do you really have so you've got to get a balance to weigh the thing really right now truth as we say as believer is something that must be measured to us really because actually there is a lot of things called truth you know people talks about the baptist truth and the mentalist truth and you know pentecostal truth and you know all of this thing really but but truth in order for it to be true there is three things that got to be established one there's got to be distinctiveness there's got to be consistency and there's got to be a consensus for it to be true your poor writing even there in galatians paul says and if an angel from heaven should come to you and teach you any other truth that that which we have teach he said let him be a curse amen jump to john the revelator he meant jesus now speaking to him john uh he said to john he said and if anything be added to it or anything be taken from it it's got to be as it is now here it is that jesus came in coming to the synagogue this sabbath day and you know you can imagine that uh the the the fame of jesus was now being echoed in the regions around and the bible says he came back to nazareth where he was brought up and there they present to him the scroll you know this young prophet let him read the scripture came in this sabbath day and the bible says that and he found the place where it was written right brother branham said like this he found the place where it was written of him because what he did he took the prophecy of isaiah and he personalized the word and he bring that which was even by revelation that came to the prophet he bring for a manifestation right there before their eyes i say like this many times that the word that was dormant on the pages for years that many times they've read the same scripture amen but that day that word becomes flesh and we're standing right there before their very eyes the spirit of the lord is upon me right hallelujah amen now it was not just someone quoting isaiah the prophet exactly yet when isaiah speak it he meant that which move isaiah to speak up was upon isaiah but when he came the one isaiah was looking to when he was on the scene this was not isaiah this was a word himself the bible says and when he spoke it all eyes were fastened on him brother said he said they said no man ever speak like this man speak before there is something about the word maybe when he took the word when he took it from the pages there's something about the way that he said it it's like the touch of the masters and upon the word of god hallelujah you know that message the anointed ones at the end time we've learned many things about the anointing in the bright age that's right and one thing brother brown showed us he said it's not the anointing that is upon the man which that anointing is a true anointing from god but he said even in the midst of that anointing he said you watch the teaching right to measure him and what is true today america can you imagine imagine i mean we watch the preachers preach and i mean we watch different ones and we said oh what anointing was upon him but what did he say right how did he bring that word to perfection him and there in the old testament they are the measuring sticker for everything that i'm an utter whatever was his experience or whatever he had came in the priests at the uramus upon his breastplate hallelujah amen if he had a dream or a vision him or a word of wisdom he mean he would not bring it to the priest and say that it was your experience and he said if the lighter amen never shun hallelujah then that is not from god i say what a way they had it and compare that to the way that we've got it today i said that every man's word has got to dovetail with the true revealed word of god glory and listen my words carefully with the true reveal word of god he said oh but hallelujah but that's what the bible says amen but we've got the reveal word of god in this day him in first curtailing with the scriptures then everything that comes afterwards there is a measuring stick for it it's the word of god hallelujah amen you know so brother branham tells us he said now we're gonna have the former rain and the latter rain right and everything has got to come in its season but the brand said pentecost with the gifts thought that they had all that was required from scripture amen the teaching reign came you know we've looked at the progression of the messenger amen you know brother branham i find it when you look at the messages of 1962 brother branham himself as a person amen as a man called from god he was at a crossroad he realized that something more had to come on the scene brother branham said he didn't know what it was hey it might be god's gonna take him off the scene anybody know that amen he's on the brink of something that was greater he said i brought you to this position and he was looking he said might be he meant somebody's gonna come after me like the minister of john the baptist and jesus hey that's gonna take you hey man a little further but he knew that there was something there amen glory truth was being delivered yet truth a useless word was being developed right man are you there with me because brethren true to him and by itself and then you know we we take him a concert from god and we said oh i believe amen i believe him on the basis of my faith believing in god amen how many truths are your god it's according to the word amen right are you there with me amen so 1962 before the seals were open and they were coming forth from the seven church age messenger amen which could have been proved to be actually former or or the teaching reign and that would have soon bring the latter rain aiming on the scene everything isn't hallelujah but god needed to bring to the bride amen was right there remember the time had to be right you know brethren we've got to realize that brother branham and he came to us as a prophet but yet he had a progressive ministry and the minister moved from one stage to another to another like any other man's ministry amen what was it coming to he was coming to the capstone amen was bringing us to a point where we're leaving him in the principles of baptism aiming of repentance and the laying on of answer him he said let's go on to perfection and that's what the world was doing to you and i am in the hebrew message chapter three brother brown say like this he said now it don't matter how great the experience is unless it compares with the scripture that's a measuring stick amen right it's wrong right he said you're in front of him he made no matter how good the prophet was if he spoke and then lights didn't flash on that europe was wrong how will the dream seem if it didn't flash under uranus it was wrong can you believe that when the priesthood ended then god put his bible up hallelujah paul said and if an angel from heaven come down right what authority do you speak with me amen amen angel come down from heaven can you think about it am i amen you think that everything that comes from heaven come down should have been from god paul was so sure of the truth that he was holding to esau knew that he had met god face to face and that which i know have is not what i learned at the feet of gamel but god is a revelation of jesus christ he said and when that revelation was so revealed to him he said if an angel from heaven could i challenge him right on this word that i believe right brethren if what you have doesn't come to that point to keep questioning all right is that right amen if it doesn't come to this point you're gonna keep questioning right this was a true measuring stick that paul knew exactly what he was talking about right he were questioning no more himself but he was positive that god is in this so if an angel come and say anything else let him be a curse because upon you what i have is a mind of god amen amen amen hallelujah an angel from heaven right hallelujah so to john the revelator which was having god himself he said i jesus and my danger to vindicate or to show these things he said if any man will add one word to it hello or take one word out of it the same will be taken out of the book of israel hallelujah of life amen therefore these experiences and these things that we have happening i don't know it wasn't vindicated by god's word and anything that you have that is not vindicated by god's word you can throw it aside exactly so many times we come to the message we take our former understanding or former experience you said well you know god called me out of this or god called me when i was a baptist god called me when i was in the mentalist church.com but god never kept you there are you with me right right hey god amen i give great respect and to those that were before me i give great respect aiming for the men who would point me to this i give great respect for the god and the vessels that god uses hey that stayed there for years and years amen until god brought me to this position remember brethren i tell you ain't in my lesions is not a great manner peace to the word of god amen amen yet i would not want it to be one day that i disrespect those are you there vessels me i respect their stance remember many times you find him in that we're being held back and then because we said i've got to give respect payment to this person because it brought me to this position reverend no man can put you in it are you there with me and we are saying no man can take you out of it are you there with me hey man it's god who led you to that position it's by the grace of god give me that holy mayor god stood there as i was moved by the holy ghost remember that holy ghost has gone be in you amen so what do i measure that which god has given me to with right so i said well you know because i came out of this ministry then i'm going to measure everything by it that's where we fail yeah hello somebody amen because we've got to go beyond that and everyone is going to prove him for himself every person is going to be certain of their position in other words that position that paul come to where he said now this note that i have that i'm looking at if an angel from heaven come and say anything else let it be a cursor because i'm positive that what i have is the mind of god right right amen amen hallelujah right yes sir aiming to read to the tears are rejoicing will continue to rejoice until the separation time come amen hallelujah him in the true anointing falls and those with good doctrine yeah an astonishing amen you might be astonished but it falls on those with bad doctrine oh yeah it falls on people that has mixed doctrine right i mean there's people amy you will believe this thing and you won't believe this thing i mean you believe this thing and i won't believe that that is why it's so important for us as believers you know we come to the word of god and you come to a ministry and many times we're being held back by him and the experiences that you've had before amen you know brother so-and-so i teach it like this and and you know i really love brother so-and-so and you know i can't even take that because brother so-and-so you've got to have a measuring stick that you measure every man's work by right are you there with me amen see if it's the truth or not right amen amen hallelujah amen yes sir amen so we've got true doctrine we've got paul's doctrine we've got mixed doctrine amen now here is a sticker and many ministers in the final day and hour are being deceived because of holy spirit anointing of this last hour that has blessed the truth even through their ministries continue to anoint even though he may be a fail or put aside many revelation of the word of god right right i said well you know i don't teach that i remember a few years back you know where the seals were amen brother said well you know well i don't read that i don't read that i remember brother one time he said when i take a book to read it you say you know there's a lot of things said at the front part there's a message given but i go to the back because i want to go to the pearl line and i want to see the acts of healing yeah because as far as he's concerned if there's anything in it it's not the words of the messenger but it's the act of healing right exactly if he's jehovah my healer he is my savior right are you here with me and he's no less my savior because he's my healer are you here with me and everything in the back is good but what about that which is before amen because the words at the stage that i might prove the vindication of god right are you there with me but it further on i realize that brother brandon in a coma heavy to give us a healing revival as a matter of fact i wasn't back there then and it didn't matter if john ryan's eye was open or not i mean that had nothing to do with me but there was a word a word legacy women that were lying their dormant amen and i'm gonna call on the scene and take the word and make the words of the people live again in my life amen amen you believe you've got a part in it yes amen hallelujah amen when we talk about the deceivers amen hallelujah even if we are honest every one of us how do you could bear witness that there were times in your life amen when you saw when you thought you saw things amen then you explained things by the anointed seal that you had amen when the light shone underworld you had to come and say to yourself him and my understanding was wrong right right brother talks about my former understanding are you there with me my former understanding because it was progressing in that prophetic ministry there's a big debate with the brother branham right in 1933 at everything and he was given it in portion of god was revealing it as he move along right hey hello somebody amen but i tell you brother branham was not god he was a man like you and i and your god has given him that great portion of heaven because of the position that he take are you here with me remember brethren i believe that he's waiting on you and i to come to the position of that revelation that he had and he didn't know what to do with himself because here it was the word was revealed and he preached it from the pulpit and then the people him were there back then 40 years ago and they did not see it and there was nothing that he could do about it that there were messages that he preached hallelujah souls that are in prison now and naturally by what he had right there before him and the things that god showed him he thought that might be tonight it's the last night and if you come tomorrow amen holiday the door of mercy's closed because of what he was going through and many times i've got to even ask myself i said lord could it be what is happening to me all right this that i'm looking at right now if the people would get it what kind of people we would have been amen hello but say it and you say it and the people believe the same way the people walk the same way you say it and you see that you're screaming and the people are not moving and you're wondering what is happening right but brethren true to master consensus so what are you going to keep preaching until it materialized and somebody said i never saw it when you first said it but today amen because that's the way my life was right amen hallelujah sometimes we get impatient sometimes an evangelist come true and he said well what's the matter with these people are you gonna watch the spirit of an evangelist because he dropped the bomb and he expect everybody to be moving yeah and if they're not moving but brother graham said the pastor comes and he picks up the pieces hallelujah any channel is it right for the people amen and you know it's not preaching that stabilizes the church right in his teaching amen amen i have a church not taught right it will never had true revelation amen hallelujah yes sir amen brother bran says the zeal of this hour is for a man to realize that i was wrong and when you say that you people begin to look at the ministers but what about your life were you always right did you always see what you're seeing today and the things that you held on to that further on god showed you not man but god show you hey that's not where it is did you recognize and come to recognize that i was wrong amen amen i love somebody amen brother may i say the anointing is not the measuring stick right right are you with me and many times what we call anointing that's not really true anointing brother bran said the greatest anointing that we've seen is the anointing that was upon jesus that day amen and the bible said he took his seat amen hello the anointing led him to the place where it was recorded hello and he brought history into the present state before them and the unbelievers were sitting there fasten their eyes on him i never get anything out of him and he say to them this day amen is this scripture fulfillment for your very eyes what you want to be there when prophecies were being fulfilled would you want to be there when the word made flesh right before your eyes and they were still looking for it yeah they never stopped hallelujah and if their nighting is not the measuring stick then what then right right because there's men with great anointing great anointing check the teaching go check the teaching and we said if some men could live the way they could preach yeah kill somebody but the people is looking for an attraction right amen hello they want to see them moving right they will be stabilized enough they need to absorb truth for themselves right now amen break from that it's not shouting you grow hello is when you can take these things and ponder these things in your heart let it sit there somewhere oh hallelujah glory amen yes sir brethren i'll tell you the thought of the word of christ that is a measuring stick right it's recorded it's written right i'll live by the message of the hour amen note before the lamb take the book we were mailing presuming all right hello somebody right you know you take revelation 5 and you know we preach that with all excitement and the crowd entouter who is worthy and there was none found worthy and then a land came him in a bloody lamb and he take the book and we get all excited anymore to read it there from revelation 5 that meant nothing but when we saw it in sinai symbol what is in reality amen that brother branham said and i would have made an awful mistake the book was still closer hey but he came into the room and brother brown said hey man he prepared a message did you know he prepared a message and he went over that this one and he researched very well i took what everybody said on the subject and he was going to present it that night he said well he came into the room it was too much late hour aiming for that message we preached over again god was ready were the people ready and i asked you the question is god ready tonight is god ready today all right but then the question still is is the people ready right amen oh yes amen brother you know brother brahms showed us he said this word cannot be tampered with and certainly the first and the second pull him and yes him and there will be a lot of impersonation upon that and that is why he mean that's not really the essence of the message are you there with me amen that was a what a great attraction it was to bring us to this position and might be if you take that attraction from all of it and where would you and i be right because it took an attraction to take us out of where we were aiming to be stabilized long enough pay me to say god can vindicate himself payment by this person in that way him and then god must have something to say so he said yes god sends a prophet in this day but may we say there's a voice the voice of god has come to us in this day and if it's the voice of god it is not what he did it is what he say you know hey man you know many people like might like hunting because brother branham was a hunter it is not what he did right hello i mean i ain't got nothing to hunt back home i don't know and if i get a gun they put me in prison i don't i i can't do that it's not what he did it's what he said amen you know what i hear people talking about hey man you know i dare and a certain deer i don't even understand some of the dragons they're using it is not in my culture right now but don't put near the outside because this belonged to me it's not what it did it's what he said are all there with me i'm gonna try to be something that i'm not right hello somebody i mean i ain't going to come here in the in the winter and walk out there with a gun in the woods i'll just reach the dead it's not a part of me but there's something that he said that i wasn't there but when it hit me because i was there in that channel david said in psalm 42 and the heart parted after the war so i parted my soul after the old god amen i came to that stage i was yearning for god i needed more of god and there was a more of god for me to receive yes sir oh you know we ought to stop and listen to ourselves sometimes some of the most foolish statements that people make within our circle today and you know they say that because they're not listening to what they're really saying right the the the hey they said the bride's understanding is beyond what the prophet saw hello yeah the bride's understanding is beyond what the prophet saw let me tell you this to david it was real when david was speaking hallelujah when david cried out in agony david didn't understand that he wasn't talking of himself right he didn't realize he was prophesying because what happened to him was so perfect in the day that he was standing in when isaiah spoke it isaiah didn't even realize he was talking about another day oh they said oh and he saw the lord in the temple amen he described what he saw but i'm unclean and i dwell on people of unclean lips and then when he was burned said who will go and eyes i said here am i sent me and then the word came to him for a virgin shall conceive an isaiah echoed it it was written he was put there as a witness and then he see a false prophet when he died yes they said because here it is witness against him but today we asked the question was the truth was the truth amen happened after hallelujah buddy it happened right amen should we shut our mouths because we don't see the manifestation of what we're looking for all right and brethren i tell you amen the bible says we love angels in our midst right amen that is why i trust in the ministry of revelation because there's gifted men who god has used and me to see the things that will be heir after and they heckle it in their day and there's people who look at them and wonder hey do they really understand what they're saying and i say this for them they don't have to understand what they're saying for isaiah never understood what he was saying but he believed in you because his memory felt like that and he had cut into love jeremiah probably said if i know what i was going to say i would not say it in a day like now but he said when he was in me he said i felt like fire shut up within my bones hey man does the brookie white get swapping oh they said he didn't have perfect understanding he didn't mean that that way he didn't mean it that way so what we try to do is try to get a consensus of men to temper down revelation to what we can believe that is bringing god down to match your own understanding all right right hello somebody all right amen but what a statement brother brian made he said and what if the missing limbs would return to the body right yeah and brother branham say that in the presumption that if you're going to stand there perfect like between 18 and 21 he said all the deformity that you see in the flesh is going to go away hello somebody amen so somebody's going to go there and try to practice to bring that missing limb right you know what sister at mom's funeral a sister that was with her from way back then was talking about something that she did some years when she was a young christian and i'll tell you they were born out there in the denomination but they had a good dose of christianity they said one day she was walking across the cemetery and this little sister was walking she was very young then he said she was walking with her they said she stopped out there in the middle of the cemetery and began to look around and she began to say mom what is it mama and she's just in this day is looking off and she said she shout out lazarus comfort he said to them he said what if there was a last horseman for the cemetery that stepped foot from the grave but you know what brethren it was so real she felt so real in her christian experience amen praise god brethren i'll tell you what what a day when the supernatural that we looked at today becomes natural amen today we put in a class of oh that's a supernatural put it on the top shelf because that is a supernatural it's not time for that yet but what a day when your revelation that the supernatural becomes so natural oh hallelujah i mean that i can look at my body and speak to my body and nature observe hello somebody i'm confirmed by your voice that's right benjamin i don't know about you but i believe that we're getting to him oh yes oh he didn't mean what he said he meant exactly what he said did i sign me what he said did jeremiah mean what he said that he meant exactly what he said because the power of god moves upon him that is truth revelation amen but i'll tell you there's something about that revelation somebody somewhere i've got to be so moved upon to let that live glory oh yes the sleeping saints they're waiting on you and eye to catch the last heart of god to call it out of the earth that's right is that supernatural no sir it is a one-man manifest are you there with me what are they waiting on are they looking over the masters of heaven i said go on go on press on all right man amen amen when we get small and slack and begin to pull back oh you know where we're too tired right we're just received yeah yeah right we're just deceived right amen you know i said back home when you know you take these young people and you know when they start to get into courtship when the boy says the donkey boy say he loves that beautiful girl and they begin to have these butterflies in their stomach and they've got a chance to go see one another and it doesn't matter what time that if your brother waited to smile because he's been there i mean he doesn't matter how they feel there's something burning somewhere that they just want to see each other they just want to fellowship with each other right although we fall so out of love with god amen you don't remember midweek service is such a burden baby because you know you've got to understand brother that we've got we've worked all day it the past master was all over us even though we worked so hard we are so tired are we gonna go get something we're gonna do this we're gonna do that but we find time for the secular things of life what about the time for god are we losing our experience come on church all right i'll tell you the truth i thought and i guess i must have been real stupid i thought that the zeal that i saw we had when we first received a message we would still have it today i really thought that but somebody pinched me and let me realize oh you're stupid you ain't going to have it but brother wait i'll tell you what i don't know what is happening there's a great cooling offer but i want to god we have the same purpose and we are yesterday amen i tell you hey they don't talk about the word no sir they talk about the current events of the church amen hallelujah who is missing where hey who is the walking right maybe they talk about only the social events of the church remember that word to god when the people leave they're talking about the fire of god they've been so stimulating with the oil and the wine that they can't wait to meet but you know you're not where you used to be amen you you know you're not there oh they said he was speaking in symbols and types and we are hallelujah and we have those hallelujah we are the opening those to you but brother never know what he was saying he didn't know what he was saying brethren i thought it was so real it was so real go read souls that are imprisoned because my father listened to the teeth it was so real to him that night go listen the message hallelujah amen how did this day is this picture fulfilled it was so real when they took him out he was still screaming out and he was updating hallelujah what jesus did in nazareth that day he was updating it that night right hallelujah he preached in middle school and they said when they take him through the little door at the back i mean i went there and looked at it and they said he was still screaming he was tired his feet was going down but he was screaming because something happened and this day is to fulfill before your very eyes there's going to be great anointing and the teaching is false because they've walked away from the word of god they don't believe it oh hallelujah and you're watching the gift there's no word of truth are you with me hallelujah because the school that they take it to i mean they take it back to those with anointing for the men of anointing become the judge of the word they become the measuring stick right hello somebody they don't care what the reveal words say they look into the anointing million for their eyes oh little slacks brother so-and-so anybody think about it because you know he's got a great anointing on him yeah oh jesus hallelujah you know i say in this day that we're living in may god be merciful to us may god may almighty god be merciful to us in our experience because i tell the truth you let somebody comes on the scene tomorrow and they begin to even see the work of the first and the second pull and then you know that they never receive the turd because they start to run falling after the sign the people want to see them moving they know somebody for the greatest move that it ever was it's a moving of the opening of the world that's right so you know amen we preach daniel sent two weeks and we fold it and we put it aside and we go to the seals and we preach then we put it aside hello somebody hello somebody uh we're going to something else but if i tell you i want to see somebody take the review word and let us lay there in it right until the day of jesus christ are you there that's not laid aside now oh you know the people aren't stirring a little bit people need to see a little bit of emotions but that's not going to get us out of here you might as well go back to the denomination because i tell you what they've got more than you've got oh yeah oh you know the church is not doing anything what is the church doing heading back in jamaica we've got food for the poor let them do that that is their ministry right they love somebody but we're called to preach the word whether they like it or not right amen amen amen hallelujah try to do god's service without it begins well he said now watch how close it gets to that razor hedge now between right and wrong so close so close i tell you brethren in this name whatever is your desire you have it amen right whatever kind of church you want you've got it amen you you want emotion you've got it you want the word in this you've got it anything you want you've got it are you telling me a man's got to make a conscious decision over his life but it's got to make a decision it's got to be determined what is truth pilot action what is truth jesus merely nonsense you're looking at it right amen so they're so close and remember he will fall on one or the other side and it comes down sometime like a huge razor between the the difference of right and wrong it's got to be every word of god every word of god hello somebody well you know i ain't gonna preach that because i mean i've got a problem yesterday and if i'm preaching that the people is gonna say i'll tell you one thing and i'll say this with real honesty when a man has got a problem he keeps away yeah oh yeah and you know i tell you and it's by the grace of god that many of us are in the position that we're in and i said the grace of god the grace of god because listen you said but but i was married twice and he said well i ain't going to touch that because you know if i do it other people are going to question me brethren i'll tell you what if you're wrong you might as well admit it right right and be delivered or that spirit people will rally around something that resembles their own affection oh yeah right and so you made many mistakes you want to find a man with many mistakes and you hug and walk along yeah yeah hello somebody but brethren what he ought to do is to find a man with all mystique and walk along with him right i just tell you the truth right i'll tell you the truth right people are looking for somebody that's right that resembles their own aspiration hello hello and you know they want to find a preacher that tells it's all right to do it right yeah it's all right to work that way yeah it's all right to run around come on somebody all right you're trying to find a voice right i'll tell you what you're doing you're laying your lies down in hell hello somebody i want to see a man if he's wrong to say i was wrong right by the band said that's a true anointing of the day oh jesus my lord amen you know when we say these things we stand right there in the judgment of them they don't miss you now you stay right there in the judgment of it hello but i say it's by the grace of god and he said and if i have anything it's by the grace of god it's not because of my strength it's not because of my righteousness it's by the grace of almighty god that separated me from my mother's name amen because i tell you what if it's wrong yesterday it cannot be right tomorrow hello somebody hello the problem the prophet never come on the scene to fix you up that's right he's got to take you out of your nest hello to your children well i'll tell you honestly i did wrong but i'm gonna tell you this this is what the word of god says amen don't let them look at look at you and you you're trying to tell them all these things that you know you never do it and when they saw you like you somebody you know you look like an hypocrite really yeah right right you really speak like a hypocrite amen or somebody was celebrating their 50th birthday and they said well you know i'm 50 today for 50 years of my life i give it to the lord you got some children you were never married for 50 years of your life you gave to the lord hello somebody yeah something went wrong i guess you got some virgin birth you gotta be honest with yourself amen you gotta be honest amen hallelujah because brother brandon said it's gonna be a razor edge between right and right exactly it's got to be every word of god not just almost every word but every word not just almost but everywhere right it's goddamn today not to looterize not the methodist not the pentecostal but of that you age in this age where just the antichrist anointing is so perfectly the antichrist anointing so perfectly it would deceive the very illness the antichrist anointed they'll fall on the wrong side if they don't watch it right like a wedge watch he said be careful may i say church be careful america be careful amen you've got a profit in your nation jesus a capernaum capernaum and the mighty words are preaching you will preach in solomon tomorrow we will be standing today right man i love somebody that's why he cried he said los angeles it's gonna be under the water amen because the mind works i'm a preacher it's a judgment to this nation may i say to you you're without excuse right right and if you run to the utmost part of the earth there'll be a witness and you've been there and you told him about it right john whistler said that convert the world and what about me i'm converted myself you're running around to give to somebody else and you haven't taken it yourself oh jesus amen hallelujah we're not living in a pentecostal age we are past that age just the same with past luther amen amen we're in the age of the very word in the ladies and church age message he said first of all that messenger is going to be a prophet have we got one amen hello somebody answer the question is he vindicated by the did what he said come to pass are you there with me can you prove it to me the truth is there consensus upon the world was he consistent in what he said did he curtain with the scripture every iota right it was distinctive to the point that brother brown couldn't stand there in that position when he preached marriage in the world he said as god gave moses amen battered upon the mountain and as god gave paul that payment for the conditions he said god give me this today and i say to you in the name of the lord jesus this nation this people this generation with our excuse we might as well believe it hello somebody we might as well believe it amen he never missed one time glory bread with me i saved you it will never miss because it's thus say the lord amen hallelujah go search the scripture jesus said to them for in them you say you have eternal life and these are they that testify of me hallelujah amen he said it was an end time period amen that the seven founders of jesus came forth revelation 10 3 to 4 and cried with a low voice as when a lion roar and when it cried seventh thunderhot of their voices brethren these things to us today are history yet the church world is still seeking right that's right oh there's a song they sing at all amen church of god when i was a child amen i remember the old fats on the school teacher used to sing it he's saying if i should die and my soul be without it's nobody's fault but mine and he was speaking the truth amen today i understand exactly what he was saying they are changing god with unchanging ways invariable centers profit him in every age where the people have strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word god always send his servant to those people but apart from the theologians in order to correct false teaching and lead the people back to god amen one more attack david was a man after god's own heart you know they said and but alcohol david did this and how could david did that but david's heart was to see the symbol of the word of god right among god's brethren people tell you what you you look at everything else that he did but when the ark of the covenant was taken from israel david had one desire if the ark of the covenant could come back among god's people oh jesus and the bible said when he saw him coming back oh hallelujah when he saw the brethren that was only the symbol of god's presence amen but david coming back amen the bible said he damned certainly his wrong fell off of him amen hey he was happy hello somebody all right i mean i can't say that about us today we don't like that because that said hey you might as well become jehovah's witness anyway yeah right you're gonna go to a church where nobody said anything about your life hello but i'll tell you what in the presence of almighty god there is always conviction right right amen exactly and i'll tell you what you know we get upset because you know something was pretty said oh it's preached on me i'll tell you one thing for sure you should be rejoicing because god remember exactly where you're living i'll tell you when you need to start up the threat is when you know that you did wrong when you come to church and you sit there in the pure sunday morning and nothing was said to trump your conscience i wonder if god has finished with you lord if that's what it's going to take to bring me to that position lord if that's the way you're going to do it hello somebody man amen i want to kiss the preacher that saves right i want somebody thank god he used the man hello because i'll tell you what i've got to decide i want to go home wanna go home the bible said that poor receive him gladly hey man i think sometimes a problem with the people they they have so much prosperity they ain't gonna see no reason to praise god we've gotta be careful now watch that spirit now amen are you here with me because he said the sufferings of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory with the glory that shall be revealing us and you know you want to see that glory you go back to the word amen amen hallelujah there's a measuring stick for the word for truth and that's the word of god it was a uranthology and it still it's today hallelujah hey when somebody said but we've got the bible for thousands of years but today we've got a legacy of the review word of god right that's right amen i'll tell you brethren if you miss it in this you're gonna find it in the review world i'll tell you this bride is without excuse right amen if we should die and our souls be without it's nobody's fault in the midst of all that we have seen over the years and for those of you who have really read the book and listened to the tips brethren i think if you miss it i remember when i took over the church in lincer there they passed her she was crippled at that time which she was a woman and she served the church for over 40 years she preached and they tell me that woman was a preacher you talk about preaching repentance and bringing sinners to their feet the woman would preach they said she had power of discernment and she was sick when there was a message the church accepted the message she was there and we took one of the little tapes and we began to play brother branham day after day after day that she heard it she said call me one day and she said brother reed you said every question that i have in my mind she said the dead man on the tape answered it and i asked you one thing would you be my pastor i said thanks be to god it's the legacy that we have today and brethren it's that that we're living on may god have mercy on us
