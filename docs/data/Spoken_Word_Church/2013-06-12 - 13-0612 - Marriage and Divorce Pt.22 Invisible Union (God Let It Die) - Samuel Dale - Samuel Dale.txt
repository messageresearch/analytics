denying the prophet in the word and and it was just set us back a little bit today because she could truly sing for the lord and she's not using that gift that's right and she's going to lose a gift for the lord amen open the eyes open the eyes open the eyes of my heart shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we shake holy holy holy shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy he's worthy amen and amen you know if you want to see him then he'll make a way he have it you'll make the way good to see everybody in the house of the lord glad to have all the visitors with us tonight we say to all of you welcome uh we have some that's been here before and then when you do that you know you're not counting a visitor around here you counted one of us so you know we've got brother ray's brother there with us he's been here before so you know he's just one of us because we don't have anything around here to join up with we're just part of the body of christ but we're glad to have brother chad and his family with us tonight and just appreciate them coming out to be with us and looking forward to a good time fellowship and for a little fishing trip and all we're going to be taking and gathering together and that way we'll be giving all of the mother's time off on father's day so that's that's a good gift i guess and give y'all time off from us all the way through but we really appreciate it appreciate brother tom and his wife coming to be with us and the lord willing brother tom will be preaching for sunday morning and brother chad sunday afternoon he didn't go over well i mean brother chad can preach sunday morning brother tom sunday afternoon what's your problem that might be best if he don't pass away before it's then just a little joke little good time but it's good to have everybody with us glad for them to be able to come with us you know come and be with us and all for the weekend but brother tom will be preaching for us sunday morning so remember him you like turn in your scripture turn where we've been reading in romans 7 and we'll read romans 7 and then we'll go to first corinthians 7 and try to get in on to the thought that we've been on uh wade told brother tom on the text thing the other day you know that you all needed a rest for the weekend because i'd been on marriage and divorce for quite a while so you know but we are upgrading up into speaking from the invisible union and that way you can cover a lot of things from the message invisible union of the bride of jesus christ and that's really our thought now we went through the marriage and divorce parts and and now we're just coming back through gleaning from uh the invisible union to tie it all together and then that you can see a lot of things that the prophet was having to say um like there to end because time was running out on him but he was running you know he was doing the best he could to bring the message to get it to you and i and we would certainly appreciate it you know we won't be on marriage and divorce tonight but we're still on the new birth because there's not much needed talking about marriage and divorce if you're not born again and that sense simple because it's not for you it's not for the world it's for the believers of the message only the prophet said you know the ones who follow the message and only for the born-again believer so you know it's not for everybody it's not a point you know but we're trying to settle this point of a few things about the new birth and i think it's a very vital situation that we need to know right around said we need the baptism of the holy ghost more than anything else in the world and that's like i told the people there over and over brother tom i've said it many times like this i would to god i wish i could preach so hard a sermon until everybody in this building would realize they were lost you know why because you could do something about it then you know you could seek god to get saved amen but if you go through life believing you're already saved and then get down to the end of it and find out you're not all right a horrible thing so i wish i could preach it to where everybody would get a settlement in their life and that's what i've done for 40 something years is to try to get the people all of us settled in our mind of what the new birth really is and what it means to each and every one of us amen romans 7 1st corinthians 7. father we thank you we just ask you now to be with us and guide us tonight as we try to speak about you we've gathered for no other purpose we've had beautiful singing worship about you and father we thank you for being the god of worship so we can enjoy fellowshipping together with one another to worship you and we just ask you now that you'd come on the scene as we talk to to the people about the word that your word is true and forever settled in heaven and then that way we don't have to worry about anything we can walk in the light of the word and as we walk in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse all of our sins so just lead us now as we speak tonight about you bless each one remember the sick among us remember these that were requested earlier lord especially the one there the man that just all the problems and all lord and sicknesses remember brother claude lord reach down and touch him and just bring him out of that because we appreciate you you are the healer and we thank you have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your love in jesus name amen amen romans 7 we get on to something and we just keep reading it and reading it uh this makes 21 times we've read this but the series just before this i read one scripture 97 times so you can't wear it out it's not doing it but and we're certainly glad to have the chad's daughters back there with us and i've got their telephone numbers and address okay we like that kind of boyfriend girlfriend thousands of miles away you don't have to worry about nothing they talk all they want to okay no glad to have you girl paul is talking here and watch what he says know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law now he's not just talking about the ten commandments right that is included but he's talking about the word of god which is the law there's many laws it's not just ten commandments to say the laws the whole entire old testament right is recorded as being the law because it was maybe expressing what the law meant right telling us what the law was explaining it like brought around said god spoke to moses moses had to interpret it to the people so that's the way we get it all right but know you're not breathing before i speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he lived now he's not talking about marriage and divorce it is right it has been used as that and is one of the scriptures we'll read in a minute for that but he's talking about mankind that word man means mankind see that means women and men and men if he didn't then you'd read that that the men were the only ones under the law the women were not under the law you know but it means mankind all of us are under the law and i've expressed this for 40 something years trying to get the people to see it see everybody thinks the law was done away at calvary my bible says christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believeth if you're not born again you're still under law you see why we need the new birth we're under the law the old testament law is still here it was not done away at calvary as a matter of fact it was magnified see the law said thou shalt not kill i shall not commit adultery i shall not steal jesus said i'll magnify if you even look on the one to lost that tree that's right see he didn't do away with it it's only done away with the born the born-again believer is the only one that the law was done away for so then that's what paul's explaining now watch what he's saying now he's made his point that the law has dominion over us as long as we live all right you see later when he gets into the things i would not i do and the things i do i would not backwards and forth are in the scripture and you can see he's toiling in a human element born again in soul but yet our bodies are not born again our spirits are not born again we're only born again in our soul all right now watch what he does and we'll read in a minute where the prophet said he's going to illustrate it paul what do you mean about what you're saying for the one which hath been husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then while it then if while her husband excuse me while her husband liveth she'll be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man now once he's not talking about just the natural brother emphasizes that in invisible union he's talking about what this verse said wherefore my brethren ye are become dead to the law now how by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law what that being dead we're in we were held see where we're dead that's what i said there today you know people don't want to die we're born dead right when you holler all your life you live 70 80 90 years old but you're dead until you're born again see until you get born again you're not alive you say well are you saying that people are not living no i'm not that dumb i may be stupid but not done okay but the point is if we don't get born again we're dead because that's what paul's explaining here but we are delivered from the law of that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in unison spirit and not in the oldness of the letter see all right now look at first corinthians 7 and 39. the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord you may be seated the lord added his blessing to the reading of the word see only in the lord we don't just go out and marry do this out of the other it's only in the lord now brother branham says that this romans 7 is a prophecy all right go ahead and pull that up brothers and we let just let the people read it he said this is a prophecy for the church now a prophecy that's that's not prophesy there's a difference in p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y and p-o-r-o-p-h-e-c-y p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y is all of the word of god coming down forth by mankind but then when man stood forth and spoke that word like moses it was a prophecy the system prophecy is actually a setting in order of scriptures right and i think that's what we need so you can say well prophecy is speaking of the future it's doing this or doing that that's true because that's what the whole bible's been the whole bible has been pointing to the future it's pointing to this end time see that the bride of christ must become the word and be changed in a moment of twinkling high and walk off of this earth then it can be a future home right there's no need of a future home right now there's no reason for it i'm not saying it ain't there i'm just saying no reason for it because we've got to be able to move out of this domain into another domain and then that way we can you know we can enjoy what we're doing you know but i'm enjoying what i'm doing here as long as the word is being revealed to me you know i have a good time doing that it's never become dull to me after i came into this message the word has always been important to me and it just keeps unfolding gradually unfolding a lot of times too but paul said this is a prophecy for the church he said it seems like it's on marriage and divorce the message here said but it really isn't see paul is illustrating what he's trying to say about law and grace and illustrating it with marriage and divorce right he illustrates it with the woman because she's a type of the what the christ you know the church so it's christ in the church that you're talking about all right so then doing that then paul is illustrating it to illustrate something you give an example right you know you take this rhetoric was the greatest of all to take that old testament and give an example from it to bring it into the new testament and speak to us about jesus christ and then you could just follow it through the bible right you know and i remember you know we used to talk about the wheel in the middle of the wheel the bill big wheel runs the faith that little wheel runs by faith and one runs by the word of god oh we had all that we're really enjoying it and we just had wheels running every which way and that was good you know but i found out one day that the prophet told me that that's right that was israel in their journey now you just think about it israel journeying through the land and god looks at it and said there's a wheel in the middle of the wheel because it was christ leading them through the land and it's a wonderful thing see then once you begin to to understand it so what is he saying this is a prophecy romans 7 is a prophecy it's just not to use or to be used to beat women over the head because you better remember when it says i said well ago it says man that means mankind but when it says woman that means church so those men don't crow too much you know we're in this thing too i remember a man laughing at me saying brother branham had actually made the statement on it is your life worthy the gospel and you listen to it if you hear him real close i had a while he said is your wife worthy of the gospel well that's what most people want to do they want to try to get the women lined up and if they can get the women lined up we're ready to go into rapture well i didn't looked at it like that i think we all got to have our own experience you know they might go in the rapture and leave us being here that may be the point but now what he's illustrating by talking about marriage and divorce see we just want to use it for our own benefit look like the bible says it but what is the bible doing is it just something that we can beat each other over the head with i got a quote you got a quote you know you can quote yourself to death you give me any scripture and probably out of memory i can almost think of one that will stream almost contrary give me any quote from the prophet and out of memory i could probably remember some point where he said something that sounds different but yet we're not supposed to be that way if the bible is a prophecy p r o p h c c watch okay if it's if the bible is a prophecy then it's got to be connected from genesis to revelation and reveal the same thing right right you can't start out with a white dog in genesis wind up with a black dog in revelation and say you got it no you goofed up somewhere you can't even get there with a speckled one you got to start with a white end with a white then you're lining it up amen every prophet what did brother say about the prophet he said every prophet compared his revelation with the prophet prior now i'd like for you to go through that sometimes women explain it because a lot of them prophets never know what that other prophet said probably never read what the other prophets had to say but he lined it up by the holy spirit that's right right amen that holy spirit was lined up look at the next quote where he's talking about illustrating it and you'll see that brother branham is not just when he gets there he's not just preaching uh marriage and divorce to them he's preaching the new birth then he's preaching it in a higher order and in higher order and just keeps climbing and climbing so wonderful how the man could preach but look what he says is paragraph 35 paul here is illustrating in our scripture about the law and grace and what's he talking about law and grace all right and illustrating it like marriage and divorce then what's this passage you're very seldom preached on because it more or less retains it like marriage anymore but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce now what about a greater portion think about something that is greater than marriage and divorce something that is greater want law and grace to see it in perfect order all right see trying to set in order here that we as a church can no more be married to the world and to christ at the same time and to be legal and lawfully about it than it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she's got a living husband he's illustrating it he's not preaching marriage in divorce to those people he's illustrating law and grace and before we can comprehend law and grace we must deal with a new birth because as i said a moment ago about the law and all those things we're still bound by that right we're still bound by that now but look what he says on paragraph 212 going to number three brother well still got the wrong one went on 56. gotta get a 212. okay we'll use that one the prophet paul is hearing saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead now see we we want to lay on what look at our prophets talking about well then women and grenades almost everything one other people remember he's talking about law and grace he's actually talking about the new birth listen to him the prophet here is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead she cannot marry as long as her first husband is living she by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as her first husband is living and she should do such a thing she shall be called an adulteress i'm speaking of the natural now there's his illustration the natural to type it with the spiritual see we think he's talking about marriage and divorce he's talking about that is an illustration to where that we can see what the truth of it is what to top it with the spiritual okay if this woman would commit such a sin then she is marked as an adulteress if she has two living husbands at the same time therefore she has forfeited her rights to god in heaven now two husbands it's not how many wives a lot of prophet peoples have how many husbands right i ain't never had but one husband all right we're not talking about that we're talking about christ in the church paul is talking about christ in the church he's just illustrating it with the marriage in divorce he's talking about whether you're born again or not see that seems to have gotten away from the people of the message you know they don't preach on the new birth anymore you just don't hear them they don't want to talk about it they got so many glorified revelations until and that's no problem of mine i preach here but see our old husband i asked for a raise of hands and said how many how many of y'all got an old husband a man would say but i ain't raising my hand because that'd make me and the women said i can't raise mine because that really messed me up now get the point the illustration he said i'm speaking of the natural to illustrate it with the spiritual see every one of us and i quote brother branham he said all of us are illegitimate born bastard born children he didn't leave yourself out that's right only jesus christ was virgin born all right and so that left the rest of us in a mess and see our problem is is we say we have the new birth do you realize by saying you have the new birth means that you or your old husband is dead because that's what paul is saying you can't be married to christ instill of the world come on paul spent a lot of time about christ in the church didn't he try it but see it must be dead watch what he says on this quote go ahead with number four paragraph 2 12. just make a little thought in your mind because see when we finish this up we got to talk about how that old husband can be killed doesn't do much good to think about shooting in between the eyes because you're a murderer and i'd just mess you up all right see now what is our old husband it was nature associated with death oh we're good people oh look how holy i am if i hadn't been what i was god wouldn't save me he still ain't saved so you've done good stuff you ain't saved anyway if you think there's something good that you've done to make god save you where did he pay the price just get all that out of your mind that's that's just i'm sorry i'm just the way i think but he said now it was nature associated with death your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth well i didn't know i had an old husband you do now you read the prophet you do now see natural you love the world because you are the world and part of the world your desires would by nature to love the world which you are part of you're a part of it by nature you believe that and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again now you have to be separated you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you can't just say well i'll divorce him and hang him up here till occasions no sir no writing or divorcement the nature of the world has to die every speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature amen now do you realize then as i was trying to express the other day to the church that when jesus said in his first doctrine to nicodemus what was it you must be born again you realize that was what he was telling nicodemus he was telling nicodemus you need to die to your old husband and he probably looked like maybe a lot of people look at me about it what do you mean old husband i didn't know i had an old husband nicodemus couldn't understand the greatest teacher of all israel the bible called him the teacher the greatest of them all and jesus said you must be born again the best he could do said you mean i got to go back to my mother and be born again jesus said if i can't explain this simple things to you there's no need of talking on heavenly language is with you about it but he says you must be born again go back and check that original translation it says you must be born from above in other words jesus was telling nicodemus you must be born from where i was born from but i remember your mama and they said it was your daddy but see brother branham said birth praying he said it was hard to get them pharisees to realize they were sinners where jesus christ could die for him what about coming to somebody that's not nothing look at the apostle paul paul said a pharisee of the pharisees a hebrew of the hebrews concerning the law blameless that's scripture but yet he said when i found out what i thought was life which was keeping the law to the letter he said i found out that was what was killing me because the law can't save you it can only condemn you only put you in jail it can't even get you out of jail that's right amen grace has to get you out of jail you can't see nicodemus he said you must be born again he said i just don't understand you a strange doctrine i'm sure that's what they thought of the prophet when he preached invisible union and he said you've got to be dead to your old husband can't you just see those pharisees sitting there listening to him that day never was in an organization i've always been free from those things what he was simply telling those people there which is the same thing he's telling you and i he was telling those people there in 1965 when it's free for he's telling they need to be born again now how can you tell people they need to be born again when they all think they're born again right that's hard to do isn't it because see we've been taught in their mind don't deny that's a problem we think if i if i say in any way brother dale that i'm lost i'm not supposed to say that show me the bible show me the scriptures on that show me the prophet on that that's organized religion that's taught you that well i got where brother ryan said we make a positive confession yeah he said because if it's positive you stay with it it'll do something i believe in a positive confession but i don't believe a confession saves you come on that's right come on am i still in the message brother brandon said you say i have accepted jesus christ as my savior that's your positive confession right he said but has he accepted you you see why most people are not saved that claim confessions you see why you got millions of confessions but no possessions because it's like i was telling the church the other day over there in the book of acts you know they were actually born again believers they were actually people that had received the holy ghost on the day of pentecost was trying to pray for them people to get the holy ghost and couldn't get it to come on them you remember that in the book of acts they sent for john or who was there's a couple more we never did get to the scripture on it i just tried to preach but sit for a couple of more to come down you know and they came down and laid hands on there and see the holy ghost was it their hand is waiting on i don't believe that i believe john the reverend was walked up and said listen forget all you shout and you're speaking in tongues and glory hallelujah we'll do that later he said let's get bored again you need the new birth that's what jesus christ died for you know what and our came the new birth you ain't never in the bible had nobody received the holy ghost it didn't hear the word first show it to him in the bible you got to hear the word first faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word all right so then it's got to be that way but that first husband that we all had that we were born kin folks we'll get to that in a second we're born kin folks to the devil that's what people don't like they're so holy and pious you know they don't like you to talk like that but is it bible why can't we talk about the bible go ahead with number five and let's read this see i'd like to read what the prophet has to say and i'd like for you to read what he has to say i mean it's not something i say it i come out here and say what we need to do is just die to old husbands boy that's a strange doctrine i didn't know i had a husband but look she was born or married connected with her first husband the first adam by the adulterous wife of eve adam's first wife you say adulterer she sure was but oh she claims now listen this is what somebody else is saying this is not brother brown read it sure sure was i'm not a english major they correct keep correcting these things and putting them up good i i would have blocked that out right there and started another sentence but that's all right ain't english see she sure was but oh she claims that this adam this first adam is dead what oh sure he died a long time ago i'm born again she said and i'm certainly married to the second adam christ the word see that's what she says that's not easy what he says she says i'm married to christ the word but he says later on he said you can't be married to a denominational church and claim to be the bride of jesus christ but he later down in invisible union i asked the church i wonder how many people got up and walked out and said i won't never go back in no denominational churches no but he later owned in that one but you think about what he's saying see our first husband was our old adamic nature are you with me now men women or whoever our first husband is the old adamic nature that we were born with what does the scripture say born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse from our mother's womb and going forth a liar according to three scriptures right and see everybody must be born again amen or we're not in the body of christ right and see that old husband must be dead he goes on to paragraph 151 and says not just put away got to be dead all right why the old nature that we were born with is the adamic nature a little baby born in a hospital room poor little thing first thing it hears i always like to illustrate i like to illustrate because that means i'm trying to give you an example right and that poor little baby is born in a hospital room and it don't know nothing for the longest ride it's laying around and can't see but the first thing it hears is a nurse saying here we are on the full moon and look at all these blankety-blank babies right the first thing the kid hears is raising cane and cussing and fussing and snorting right so truly we ought to know where we're born at and why jesus said you must be born from above there was no natural birth you know those israelites cherish the fact of circumcision because they thought they'd done away with the sin in the garden i've always believed that after i heard when i heard the prophet say a few things it clicked them pharisees said i wasn't born like you i was born with a perfect lineage he said you must be born again what about being born kin folks to the devil now i'll tell you what so i've been in church all my life i wasn't born ken folks to the devil well who's your born ken folks to you certainly wasn't born ken folks to god my mama my mama and my daddy they took me to the truck service inside the baby yeah and how did that baby wind up at about two years old with cooking his hand and cookie on his face and standing there and you say did you get that cookie ain't got no cookie mama don't lie daddy don't lie where did the lies come from because of the domain that we're born in we're born in satan's domain right that's why jesus was misunderstood so much when he spoke of a kingdom he was speaking that they must come first the baptism of the holy ghost a kingdom before they could be a physical kingdom to come to all they wanted was physical see what about being born kin folks to the devil my brother dale i don't like you well good pray for me you need the prayer and i assert i mean you need to practice and i need the prayer so we'll do both of you but look what brother branham says on number seven which is e37 power of the devil 1955-1005 just little points for you to think about i want you to study in a minute every one of us under the domain of satan here in this world which is his now that's the way we was born we were born in satan's domain going down through our reading a little bit and you'll see him talking of a statement that we wonder a lot of times you know that the devil tried to give jesus all of these kingdoms and jesus didn't say you don't own them he just knew he'd follower to him later so he didn't argue with him he just said get on behind me but he didn't argue satan could have given him every kingdom of the world because it belonged to the devil that's why there's so much trouble out here in the world well there'll never be peace on this world here that we live you can't do that you got the the jacobs and esau's you got all of the troubles and now we're not even dealing with jacobs and esau's we're dealing with all these other kind of names that's come in everybody wants their little piece of the pie and they don't care who they kill to get it it's a justifiable means you know the end is justifies what we've done to do it so we just kill people we want to know that's the devil's domain show me one government that's not the devil's domain don't mention the united states because you know better than that you live here all right if you got any sins you know but listen see our old adamic nature from the fall in the garden put us into satan's domain and need to be born again to get out of it look at the next one kinsman redeemer paragraph 176 and see whether you think you belong to him or not now quickly let's get down to the end of it and we'll find out the next morning when she woke up this is talking about ruth she was happy waiting and the man came and he went down he had another kinsman that really had option on the woman first that's ruth the third chapter verse 12 and 13. see boaz had to go pay the price ruth had won ken folks closer ken than boaz was boyz had to get him out of the way right boaz happened to be smart enough because if you remember the story go read your bible when it came down to the point that there was boaz standing there to gates you know to announce in front of the people because that was publicly the way they done he said redeem the right of naomi read your bible the kinsmen said i redeem the right now what's boya's going to do boaz is really goofed up you know that when boaz and ruth and all of this happen and he tells her you know you got a near ken and i got to deal with him don't worry about i'll take care of it he really goofed up you know what he'd done he gave her six measures of meal to take home with her right that represents the prophet said to six thousand years of mankind upon the earth in the dealings of mankind in what would be in the redemptive form but he gave us six seals right the plan of redemption because that covers us six thousand years see boaz gave that to ruth before he paid the price study your bible you need to read that we'll put it up on the screen and be glad to read it boyz gave her that before he went down to the kinsman redeemer because boaz was christ right and christ knew exactly what to do now there's a natural story goes with the book of ruth right those were natural kinsmen there were natural things and see it wasn't a as we would try to do it had uh naomi and her husband and and all of that they sold their property when they were leaving go study a bible had they not sold it they would have just come back and naomi would have walked back in and said i'd take my husband's property right there would have been no kinsmen it would have been no story involved but that wasn't the way it wound up they sold their property but yet still you had a name tag hooked to that property of who did it belong to well naomi's husband had a kinsmen a man a literal person boy as this is not a fictional story to just bring christ in the church this is dealing with a natural thing and boaz goes down and he says okay you just you told ruth he said you just go on i'll take care of it well he goes down and he says okay kinsman redeem the right of paying what naomi owes and you have naomi and her property the man says i will redeem read your bible and put old boys in bad shape now he already had figured out what he's going to do that's why he gave her the six measures of meal he knew what he's going to do i like to tell natural stories to illustrate you know what he was doing so boy i said okay you redeem naomi you're the more kin i'm dexter you're first so you got the right you paid the price he said okay i'll pay the price he said but there's just one problem he said if you get naomi you got to take ruth read your bible ruth was a gentile i'm just giving you the natural story where you look at it read the book of ruth because it's a wonderful book i remember the first time i read it after coming in this message seeing what it was sitting on the bed talking to my wife about it and he says you got to take ruth and said now what you got to do you know the law you got to have children at least one by ruth and says and by the way you know the law that won't be your child it'll have to go to naomi because it won't be yours and ruth you've got to go to naomi because that's the purchase price and that old you sitting there can't you just see well i'll tell you what now buddy i'll take naomi he said you can't do it you've got to take ruth and you've got to have children by ruth that'll go to the name of that man that died he turns around immediately and he says you just do what you want to i ain't buying no dog right then what he said he said redeemed to write he first said i will then when he was told what the story was he said i don't want it because that old natural jew that won't know gentile in his lineage boaz knew exactly how to get ruth he'd already give her the six measures of meal and told her said don't you worry about it naomi said don't you worry read your bible naomi don't sit don't you worry he will do what has to be done because he was christ amen right amen but we had a near ken we had a near ken look at number eight paragraph 176 the kinsmen redeemed did we read that one just to make sure you understand i think we headed up see when she woke up she was happy waiting the man came he said he had another kinsmen but really that really had option on the woman first never got the time and he said the next one in the parable that had optioned on you okay this ain't talking about ruth and boaz and on you was the devil because you sinned and first you belonged to him because you was you're his property for you were born in sin shaping iniquity there is your old husband amen your old husband is your adamic nature that we are all born with and brother branham was born with that nature just like anybody else there's a lot of things people don't want to quote where he says he was born a hybrid they don't like them they want to pass over those books you know but listen old nature old husband you see why we got to be born again nicodemus your old husband needs to die nicodemus says i can take you over here and show you i have all the signs i have everything that's what he was talking to him about i can show to you i got my lineages i got my paperwork i got everything and you telling me that i've got to die he said to be in the kingdom i'm in it requires your death you realize what it took to make this to where we could actually change and that old husband could even die how could that old husband dies anything we could do to merit salvation but yet the old husband's got to be dead now what are we going to do with him you may not like this but you know you look in the brothers you look at him in the mirror every morning you shave that old boy and you sisters get there and pretty yourself up you know just remember the old booger man was the one that caused the problem and after a while you'll get little zits first right girls then you get little pimples little things come on your face and then you get the chicken tracks it starts and you get you know what that is you're dying right oh you can get the face lifts you can do all of that ain't gonna change a thing you're dying that ought to let us know we need to be born again die but around say every speck of him has got to be dead not just hang him up in a closet like the sister the lady he said was saying it well you know he died a long time ago you go reading on down through there you'll find him talking about the kind of life that you live as proofs whether your husband's dead or not right well they don't make no difference whether i cut my hair paint my face or wear ungodly clothes or men just do you know what all of this stuff don't well no it don't if you're lost but if you claim to be a christian it means the whole world born in satan's domain kin folks to him you know if we're not born again we're going to go where he's and at to my bible it says death and hell the devil is going to be cast into the lake of fire which is the second death so then that's where we're going to go and the prophet said that's the death of the soul so that's where we're going if we're not born again see if we're not born again that old husband is still alive that's why you sisters now come on come on let's just be sensible you know i like to talk to people and like i told them here years ago i used to at 16 years old i'd been talking like this to you because i'm so embarrassed you know one day i found out ain't nobody in this world no better than i am and i ain't no better than nobody else i figured that out and i started looking people in the eye and i love to preach looking you an eye you know i get some surprising expressions sometimes of course you get some too from me but that's all right but you see church this is not dealing with the fact of whether or not we think we ought to be born again this is not dealing with a point well maybe he's right maybe i need to be saved why is the preacher's not preaching to the kids that they need to be saved you know what they're getting must be saved i'm in the message i believe the prophet so does the devil now he doesn't beat you there he said yeah but but you know i love to be told how good i am no you can't be told how good you are until you find out how bad you are then you find out what somebody done for you makes you good you realize why jesus would say to nicodemus you must be born again and the original would say you must be born from you realize it took somebody to come from above there was nothing we could do the law paul said blameless according to the law the pharisee if he had one mark against him the high priest and on up in the lineages they killed him right but here we are thinking it was some good thing that we've done or we believe the message that's wonderful to believe the message how many were to believe the message here regardless of whether we're born again or not we wouldn't want to read and hear the tapes of the prophet either whether we even claim salvation or not why we caught it so wonderful him to talk about god the way he is the way he does and see for you and i to ever be saved that means god had to come from a glory not send a son a second person that's trinitarianism he never sent a son he came himself would you send your one of your kids to die in your place you ain't no good daddy plain language that ain't much i finally got it in the dictionary i quoted enough would you say would you send one of your kids to die in your place okay got three we'll stop a coin see which one gets it that's not a daddy god came himself because he was the only one that could pay the price right he was born lord to christ according to the bible eight days later he received the name of jesus which had already been told before then to make sure they named him that but when they were told in the bible to name it they were told him to name emmanuel why didn't they do that because they did when they called him jesus all right jesus is the only name that god ever had that's why jvhv is won't work because jehovah's not correct jesus is the only name that god ever had that's why we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ not father son holy ghost because that's what he told us to do but you see that meant god had to come down here to get here to be in this domain to make a way that you and i could be born from above give us a new birth to give us a chance to be saved see now just for a minute what is the new birth i believe the message now come on i don't play games you don't play games that's the way i preach nicodemus the teacher nicodemus put his job on the line and they found out the old boy was over there talking to jesus he wouldn't have been the teacher he was a pretty good believer and i think it was him or nicodem nicodemus or grammar one i'm pretty sure it might be kamehameha but he said or maybe nicodemus said it said we know that the art of man come from god because nobody can do the things that you've done unless god be with you now that's a pretty good believer would you oh we've got to do believe believe what how can you believe the bible said in him that you have not heard amen he said how can you hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sent so all of these that went wouldn't send that's why there's not too many new births the prophet said one day come on is that a quote he said not too many new births this is where he said it he said false prophets bring false verse that's a quote come on he said true prophets bring true verse well i guess brother brown's the only one that can get a birth on us see that's where we got all of that figured out in their mind and not realizing that that's setting the stage to cut off the truth he that cometh to god must believe that he is not even to believe that he was that's not the bible must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him what good is a god of history what good is a god that's somewhere behind come on i don't mind being this blunt about it what good is the god of william branham come on come on brother i believe god was with the man don't you because nobody could do what he done unless god be with him right right hallelujah but you have to talk about a god of william brown and won't save you you've got to have a personal experience within your heart peter had a pretty good experience there when he was talking about he said i was up on the mountain he was there right when the glorification of jesus and peter and him come on peter over on his writing he said out on the mountain but he said i've got a more sure word a what what'd he say yeah i have a more sure word of prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y i've seen it all put together by the new birth that i received at pentecost because until then i was mad in a hornet and fighting and cutting people's ears off and everything else didn't save me what is the new birth i spoke in tongues i shouted i cried come on a baby don't cry until it's born what do we want to do with all of that why don't we want to put evidences in all this got to have something a baby don't cry till it's born you say well it's in the womb crying yeah but you ain't never been in there to find out either i just make it blunt your prophet said that baby in that wound was no more now you do what you want to with it no more than an animal condition a baby animal in the wound of a mother dog it wiggles and whines and does things but he said that baby when it's born that soul comes into it makes it a living soul where that animal can't do it right when that baby's born it becomes a living soul it's not a living soul i'm glad the prophet explained those things because all of this to abortions and this that or the other and i don't agree with it but that baby's not a baby until it comes into embrace receives a breath of life then it becomes a living soul right so what is the new birth you know the word birth means is very odd when i used to remember that from the old baptist days because i used to talk with them about it the word birth means a coming forth into go home and look it up and then just get down and just think about what this is saying it means a coming forth into that's why brother brown says you burst into this burst into this burst into this coming up statue of a perfect man because there's a coming forth into it's coming forth into each one coming higher and higher and higher all right what is the new birth let's just read what your prophet had to say about it go ahead with number nine brother let's just see what your prophet had to say after christ the mystery god revealed preached in 1963-728 paragraph 2 33 234 look christ in you makes him the center of the life of the revelation that's christ in you christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible a complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing now you're to believe in prophecy a setting forth in scriptures and pointing down to this day to you and i the whole bible is pointed to you and i am come on see what god is trying to do trying to get us to realize who we are what is the new birth then you'd say well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you no he said amen can we say not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a coat of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon what is the new birth brother branham it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you well i thought it was when i shouted and i cried and as attributes a baby come into the world cries that's an attribute of the baby right we've got to get here for christ the holy ghost fell in the book of acts and then they went outside speaking and doing things see we're turning it around putting it backwards we want some sign or some feeling or some emotion and i believe in every one of them i do i believe in shouting i've never spoken to but i'm a firm believer in it i can quote the prophet on that and he said you'll lay on a spout long enough he'll come forward one day you'll be speaking well okay one of these days i'll speak and i'll be happy now i don't have to have it why because i've got a revelation of jesus christ that god come down to take my place he come down to make a way that i could be saved he had to die to do that and all he wants us to do is die die to ourselves right and be born again what about this one look at number 10 progress 71 patmos vision 1960 1204 in the evening now ask god to while you're talking on revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this for it can only be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation come on you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call jesus to christ only by the holy ghost that's what the bible says no man can say jesus is a christ until the holy ghost has until the he has received the holy ghost he might say the pastor says so the bible says so then we're truth the church says so that is true but you don't know yourself until the holy ghost has revealed it to you and he's become in you no man can call jesus to christ only by the holy ghost not by knowledge not by intellectuals what do you believe the new birth is it's the birth of the word a birth of the word i made the statement a while ago and let's see you somebody show me the any other way there's never been nobody in the bible ever say that didn't hear the word first if you did you'd have to do away with faith comes by hearing which you see our problem is and we'll get back into it later when we get on over into the law and grace see what we have been taught has blinded our minds to the simplicity of the gospel is that what paul said he said lest satan deceive you through his septility as he did eve through the simplicity that is in christ he said how much more simple could you get than almighty god we were lost and doomed and the only way he could save us was to come down and die we see everybody wants to say but my god can't die your prophet said that when a man in the world could die like that well he said he said no man could die as he died he said what happened there the body died right with the soul and spirit left out of that body on calvary no god can't die like that as god that's why they couldn't touch him the anointing the prophet said came on him on the river jordan made him the anointed messiah you know they couldn't touch him as long as that anointing was on him that's right but your same prophet turned around and said the other anointing left him in the garden of gethsemane that didn't take away all he was of god he walked up there being almighty god because he hangs on the cross and he said before he gets there he says my soul is troubled he was still god the anointing came on him and left where they could kill him because with that on him he couldn't kill him you see church why preach for 40 something years when that anointing strikes his church she won't die and the anointing that struck him for his ministry on the river jordan when it strikes a bride and who she really is she won't die that's right you can't kill her then because you can't kill her until god gets through with it you know that quote brother around said god took a picture of you at 18 20 years of age he said he turned around to the devil and said go at it do all you want to to them make them get their little zits and their hair falling out in the gray hairs make all of those things with chicken tracks in their face do all of them things that make them opposite you can't touch their life he said you can't take your life he said i could the only one can do that i'm the only one that can take their life you can't do it amen you see satan cannot destroy you and i he would love to he can't do it but when god gets through with us then he can come get these old bodies i ain't worried about that at all you see church what i'm worried about is whether or not we believe what i just said what is the new birth he says it's a revelation of jesus christ personally to you has god revealed itself to you not you believe the message not your shouting spoken tongues and all these things but has he revealed itself to you do you have something that you can walk on do you have something that will stand all these doctrines and things flying about the land it's not going to deceive the bride the bible says there must needs to be heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest right makes you dig makes you get out and pray he said lord don't let me be deceived with the rest of them that is the new birth the birth of the word but you know to get a birth of the word let me get one more real quick now what are we going to do how is it possibly we could go through the future home and explaining the things of the prophet but how are you and i gonna ever come to a new birth he said well you're brother you're talking to people that's got the new birth amen if i am i'm not worried about it because i ain't worried about you thinking i'm trying to deceive you or trying to take away your sugar tit i'm trying to get you to anchor in what you got to where nobody can shake you and no matter what comes or goes you say the word says it i believe it i'm staying with that amen the prophet said every speck of him we read while ago paragraph 2 12 2 13 of the invisible union every speck of him must be dead right go into the book to call the future home in about 15 16 there and read it he explains redemption in a beautiful situation and he says first is justification just chopping off your past sins this nut does nothing to you nature you remember a while ago our whole nature was the nature of the world he said it does nothing to that it just chops off your past sins read it except within the unclean spirit goeth out of a man jesus said walketh in dry places he said that's sanctification an unclean spirit goes out but the bible says we got to have you know the bible says we need the holy ghost and fire you believe that scripture if you don't the brothers can pull it up in a hurry and we'll read it but if you don't need it you ought to realize that's true holy ghost and fire amen well what it is the holy ghost is doing this and the fires are doing that go to the future home and read it brother says when that holy ghost comes in to you to give you a new birth he says it burns out everything that's left of you it's not two different things it's the holy ghost coming in and burning out all of those devil nature things that's left of us and we die we die but i don't know brother dale how can it be done go ahead with number 11 brother and we'll get this and quit they're trying to find that other one but it's all right just leave that we'll find the other one later look what he says on paragraph 281 282 invisible union and now and so do every one of us know that the whole rank of denominationals pentecostal and all are dead that is to the born-again christian of the message all right listen uh-huh your first husband is dead you know he's dead how'd he die god let it die right god let it die uh-huh your first husband you know he's dead god let it die it's finished all this scientific intellectual education scientific ways of so-called bible schools and things is perished what's it done separated one that's here trinity's here tune is here over here and down here and such a mess up here and call themselves blue lights he said that says pentecostals well i just say lulates because if that's what we think that her old husband is dead if god didn't let it die how did it die because i said well ago and i was just blunt playing i had a man to tell me one time he's talking to me he kept on pressuring me to talk on marriage and divorce and i finally said a few words to him and i said her old husband's got to be dead oh he was almost upset because then he got agreeing all she's got to do is go shoot that first husband good you got a point now you're a murderer the bible says a murderer don't go to heaven so now what good is it to go out and shoot the old husband now let's quote a few scriptures of the prophet and quit oh brother to hell i'll tell you in my life i just i saw god and i sought god i prayed i fasted i did everything i sought god come on and we did and that was good well one day i heard the prophet make a statement it was really kind of shocked my little ego because i thought i was doing pretty good fasting and praying and crying and you know my story i was in this message two years i was a baptist deacon at 23 years of age i come in this message i was reading i have read six books a day and listened to two tapes after travel the door wheel and back two years i sought the baptism of the holy ghost i didn't come in this message saying i come into the message proof i got the holy ghost when that prophet started talking about the holy ghost in the bible i knew that was a god he's talking about not just a baptism not a point it was a real god he was real but you see my problem was i didn't know how to let him die i didn't know how to kill that old devil so it took two years of the prophet's message and a statement from a brother that said brother dale i know you're not seeking any kind of signs and wonders i said i wouldn't even know what to seek for if i did i said you know i don't believe in that he said but there's something stopping you from getting the holy ghost i said i agree with you because i haven't got it he said we'll only make one statement to you he said you're seeking the holy ghost at a baptism or a point you know some kind of anointing well whatever it is i don't know he said let me tell you something the holy ghost is a person okay now we got something to talk on and he said he's a person of the word he said all these years you've been hearing the word he said now just ask him to come in and that's all it is you mean that simple was what it was yes do you have any experience yes my wife was in the altar at the same time she fell one way and i failed the other why because i realized the new birth was the birth of the word i knew i had the word laying in there as a disciple to remember jesus says there said they took the word and held it but they didn't say they were born again but they went to the upper room and an experience came that began to open the word to him and that's what peter said i have a more sure word of prophecy brother dale you mean you never had great experiences i've had wonderful ones i saw god when i was 11 years old standing in a church he said well you just exalted not just telling truth i've seen an angel three times in my home no problems but none of them saved me none of them saved me but when the word become alive in my heart i knew there was a person living in me that hadn't been present before see i know what the new birth is what are you telling me i don't have it no you don't have to come the way i come but you got to have your own experience my wife cannot go on mine my kids cannot go on mine my my daughter-in-laws my son-in-law grandkids and great-grandkids they can't go on my experience they got to have their own something then that satan can't take away from you and it may be something so simple there's god just dropping down in the middle of the night and says i am the god of abraham may be that simple but see once that happens you'll never worry about anything else right then you don't worry about what you preach because you you know in whom i have believed what is the new birth the revelation of jesus christ personally to you he's speaking to your heart don't turn him away see we've made it to be some great big thing that we all have to do or do that or do this or do that why no just accept jesus christ as your savior keep right on walking one day he'll meet you it'll all be settled be a finished product because it's a new birth he said well nicodemus believed that's good he had a confession a lot of times we go through life with a confession but we need a possession god let it die god is the only one that can kill that whole nature we can't do it you can't control yourself you say you can alcoholic's anonymous but they'll never take out of the person the desire to want to go back and drink you say yeah they will because they scare them to death you know but every time they see that they'll have a problem but the new birth comes down and cleanses it all out makes you a new creature come on brothers makes you a new creature the bible says in christ jesus now let's get one more quote paraphrasing jesus christ coming and living in you that's the whole thing that would be the new birth and by doing that then paul said it's not i that liveth the christ that liveth in me but i've never had a great rat shining light here's the quote the prophet said the mystery of the end time something to that degree it was a secret that you could receive the baptism of the holy ghost without a sensation now i want you to find me where he said you can have the holy ghost without an experience no no but without a sensation a sensation is a stimulation upon these outward beings coming from the inward part of us called a spirit but he always believed in having the experience i believe in it too i believe in a definite work of justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost to make us the new birth see that's why when he's talking he's explaining christ in the church illustrating it as a marriage and divorce situation telling your story jesus was good at telling a parable about something that was over here and over there you know i wonder when are we gonna catch on because you know after a while those pharisees in the beginnings they went along with his stories and they heard him and while they said i think he's talking about us well that's true he's talking about them let's stand but god let it die he let that old husband die that you could be born again right he made a way to kill him and it's through the revealed word taking in that word and letting it drive that unclean spirit out and then let the possession come in there's a newborn go ahead what do we got 369. the red one 369. oh god heaven amen is is then the best thing to do is say lord i love you and you said if i follow you and do what you say you give me the holy ghost go wash away first repentance of your sins ask you to forgive you go get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he said well i'm not god father son holy ghost that ain't even in the bible that's what man taught us it says in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost that is the lord jesus see then you're christ a bird by the words you're following the word jesus then they start reading it foreign amen come on we'll pray i believe in that too but i believe it took three and a half years to drive that demon out of them disciples it may take then you'll see a change then your sister and i'm saying you remember it when you struggle with your hair and your clothes and your doings and your top of the church right you remember what that happened you know you had troubles but then one day it become a settled peace and you just said a bride don't act like that so let me do what my master my husband don't you see the bible speaks of a first adam and a second adam the first animal just made a living soul second adam was made a living spirit first husband with her on adamic nature our second husband is jesus christ and he is the word why would you want to read anything else and to take the prophet's message and just believe it because he's my husband you know what the bible calls it he calls it my husband my savior my brother my redeemer my advocate he's got many titles but his name is jesus his name is jesus paul gets over there a bunch of people that were pretty good believers the book of acts he said have you received the holy ghost since you believe and we receive the holy ghost since we believe well i didn't know i needed to seek god well i believe the new birth is a born-again experience you know and if we don't seek god for a growth development it won't so it's a birth to coming for them too it's just gradually unfolding of his word then he's coming back after we're born bride by the water of the word you notice that prophet even goes on and some people have wondered rolico saying that the world was waiting you know everything's waiting on you and i what it says in hebrews 11 40. they without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on us you know that brother reynolds said the bride would vindicate malachi 4. right he said the bride will vindicate luke 17 30. do you need that quote all the things that brother brother spoke of all the prophecy the setting in order is waiting on somebody to come from about being a prophecy and not just prophesying of how good we are but to becomes what god said we are the bride of jesus christ what greater opportunity could be holy spirit holy spirit you're a comfort to me you lead me our
