[10:04] revelations
[10:06] 1
[10:09] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[10:11] gave unto him to show into his servants
[10:13] things which must surely come to pass
[10:15] and he sent and signified by his angel
[10:17] unto his servant john
[10:19] who by a record of the word of god and
[10:21] of the testimony of jesus christ
[10:23] of all things that he saw
[10:25] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[10:27] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[10:30] those things which are written therein
[10:32] for the time is at hand now we're going
[10:36] over to revelation 6.
[10:39] i'm going to read
[10:41] verse 5 and 6.
[10:43] and when he opened the third seal i
[10:44] heard the third beast say come and see
[10:47] and i'll be held and low
[10:50] a black horse and he that said on him
[10:52] had a pair of balances in his hand and i
[10:55] heard a voice in the midst of the four
[10:57] bc
[10:58] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[11:00] measures of barley for a penny and see
[11:02] thou hurt not the oil
[11:04] and the wine you may be exceeding the
[11:07] lord that is blessing to the reading of
[11:10] the word
[11:11] now
[11:12] we'll try to review a little bit back
[11:14] where we were this morning and
[11:16] and
[11:18] you know go from there with the message
[11:21] because i want you to get this part
[11:23] i believe it was
[11:24] you know
[11:25] part of the service this morning to do
[11:28] and i want you to
[11:31] get the point in order to see
[11:33] that
[11:35] and it's very vital to me because i told
[11:37] you that was one of the things that the
[11:40] lord showed me this time on the opening
[11:41] of the seals that
[11:44] the prophet knew
[11:46] the writer and who he was
[11:49] when that opened unto him and he saw the
[11:51] antichrist right
[11:53] all right
[11:54] once that was made known that that was
[11:56] satan in the form of the antichrist
[11:59] then
[12:00] he wouldn't have to be dealing with each
[12:02] age because it doesn't
[12:04] deal with a red writer a white rider or
[12:07] a black writer or a pale rider the horse
[12:10] is what the color is right and the horse
[12:13] is the symbolics of the church
[12:16] the power
[12:17] the things that are taking place
[12:20] you know here up on earth
[12:22] and but the writer himself is the devil
[12:25] right and we'll see when we get down to
[12:27] the fourth seal that he becomes
[12:30] satan incarnate
[12:32] and that makes it come back to the beast
[12:34] again
[12:35] for the life
[12:37] but i want you to to
[12:40] think on these things
[12:42] and i want you to think about
[12:44] the that said the writer this morning he
[12:47] gets off the white horse he gets on the
[12:49] red one
[12:50] well that doesn't stop the white horse
[12:53] that deceptive point just keeps right on
[12:55] going right there
[12:56] falls out to the end right but when he
[12:58] gets off the red horse and gets onto the
[13:01] to the black one it doesn't stop the
[13:03] horse you know the actions the ways that
[13:07] that we're talking about the symbols
[13:09] that we're looking at what these mean
[13:12] it doesn't stop that
[13:14] that just continues right on
[13:17] but it's just a writer getting off
[13:19] getting on to the next getting on to the
[13:20] next
[13:21] and then when it comes down to the beast
[13:24] now what's the point and you'll see that
[13:27] he doesn't get off of the beast
[13:30] and watch
[13:32] he doesn't get off of the beast and get
[13:35] on another colored horse
[13:37] right
[13:38] because the pale is the nice one
[13:41] you know
[13:42] in other words when it comes down to the
[13:43] beast part
[13:45] it won't be getting off of that horse
[13:47] the pale one to go on to another horse
[13:51] it comes to an end and brother run says
[13:52] see there
[13:55] you can see that by this the antichrist
[13:57] is revealed in his ride and you know his
[14:00] end is revealed
[14:02] and it's revealed because of the uh
[14:06] combat beast
[14:08] and what they're doing right but i wish
[14:09] you would read
[14:11] those things in there because we're
[14:12] going to get back to this on
[14:14] the fifth seal and and pick it up
[14:17] but i wish you'd read the things that he
[14:19] talks about these combat beasts
[14:22] how that they
[14:23] uh are the line the ox the man the eagle
[14:27] and you know and what we're seeing here
[14:30] that's the question i want to go about
[14:31] it what we're seeing here
[14:34] is we're seeing what's happening in
[14:35] heaven
[14:38] all right because that's where this
[14:39] scene is first at right
[14:42] but then it's got to come to earth right
[14:44] yes amen all right see then it'll show
[14:47] what's happening on earth this writer
[14:49] was writing on earth right but when you
[14:51] see it here it's more or less into a a
[14:54] writing of the book
[14:56] lord john's writing down
[14:59] so he's writing down he doesn't right
[15:00] now we're going back to earth you know
[15:03] he doesn't say things like that
[15:06] it it was you just go right straight on
[15:08] across and he sees all of it while he's
[15:10] in the uh
[15:12] atmosphere of the holy spirit to reveal
[15:14] it to him
[15:15] all right then when he does come down he
[15:18] realizes it's going to happen here right
[15:20] here so these things that we see are
[15:22] happening here
[15:24] remember the lord doesn't show john what
[15:27] it was
[15:28] and if you and i are
[15:30] in the bride of christ
[15:33] then we can see where we're at
[15:36] because these four beasts
[15:39] line the ox the man and the eagle
[15:41] are also the same four beasts
[15:45] you know
[15:46] now not the theorems you know that
[15:48] that's the theorems is the untanglable
[15:51] but the i believe zoom all right they
[15:54] are the ones we saw in chapter five
[15:58] in heaven
[16:00] you know and we kind of left it and went
[16:02] come on back down and started on the
[16:04] others and didn't spend a lot about
[16:06] these combat beasts but i wish you would
[16:09] notice one particular thing
[16:12] i don't think i brought it today i'm
[16:13] sure i didn't
[16:16] i brought around when we get down to the
[16:18] part of it calling death i know it's on
[16:20] the fourth one
[16:21] he said see there you didn't see that
[16:23] under the line
[16:25] you didn't see it under the box in other
[16:27] words the man
[16:28] it's got to be the eagle
[16:30] so that's going to bring it down is what
[16:32] i was trying to say this morning let's
[16:34] get this thing down personal
[16:36] to where we're at
[16:38] you know and the person made a good
[16:39] point to me about it because it was good
[16:41] see the line the opposite man the eagle
[16:44] we see him up here in the opening and
[16:45] thing but then down on earth we see
[16:49] what is taking place
[16:51] and you know it's not just
[16:53] that the first one was a line because
[16:56] there's not a name attached to that one
[16:59] but it says come and see
[17:01] right the second see it says the combat
[17:04] b should come and see
[17:06] and the third open says come and see
[17:09] well then the fourth when it opens it's
[17:10] an eagle
[17:11] we can connect with that because that's
[17:13] our day and our time all right but what
[17:15] i want you to look at for a second and
[17:17] keep this in mind
[17:18] that
[17:19] you know that those combat beats were in
[17:22] the people
[17:23] right right here amen
[17:25] see now we are after the prophet came
[17:28] and brought the message
[17:31] see i'm going to get back to everything
[17:32] i'm not going to spend much time on that
[17:34] point
[17:35] see you and i are now to say and come
[17:37] and see
[17:40] are you listening
[17:42] now
[17:43] i'm saying come and see what's under the
[17:45] seal
[17:48] see you go out you talk to the people
[17:52] and you say well look at this and look
[17:53] at that look at this see it's the combat
[17:56] beast in you right
[17:57] right let's say and come and see
[18:01] you know
[18:01] but it's still riding in you because
[18:03] it's riding in come back against him and
[18:06] we'll get into the fifth seal you know
[18:08] to pick that up more
[18:09] but i wanted you to think on that point
[18:12] until then to where we can look at it
[18:15] all right
[18:17] you see don't think that
[18:19] satan is ever
[18:23] he's always trying to
[18:25] pervert god's word that's his tactic
[18:30] that's his ways of doing he's trying to
[18:32] pervert the word but if he can get in
[18:34] our minds that there's something wrong
[18:36] with the word
[18:38] and he can make you and i doubt our
[18:40] sword
[18:41] the word
[18:42] right
[18:43] he's got us defeated right
[18:47] he doesn't have to do anything else
[18:49] he's got us defeated because we're
[18:51] doubting
[18:52] the word
[18:53] that's why i spend so much of my time
[18:56] and you know that i've done it for 40
[18:58] something years
[19:00] taking the things that
[19:02] seemingly contrary
[19:05] annual 70 weeks seals and
[19:08] things and and bringing them down to
[19:13] to try to help you and i
[19:14] to where satan can't
[19:17] say look at that
[19:19] he missed it right here
[19:21] see it's wrong here
[19:22] but if he can get you to think for me to
[19:25] think one time that's right
[19:29] all right bible
[19:31] right if we can make us doubt one word
[19:33] of this
[19:35] he's got us defeated
[19:41] keep that in your mind
[19:43] you say well we don't understand all
[19:45] this i didn't say that right
[19:49] not having understanding is one thing
[19:53] but when we come to the place that we
[19:55] doubt
[19:56] the word that's right right that's why
[19:59] it was so hard back there
[20:01] years ago
[20:02] on the dates and the times and the
[20:04] seasons
[20:06] and i'm so hard now against the
[20:07] preachers of this message that are
[20:09] destroying the message that's right
[20:12] well if they can destroy the message
[20:14] and we know brother brown was a human
[20:17] and made mistakes
[20:19] made slips with the tongue yeah
[20:23] that's no problem because he'll be human
[20:26] right
[20:27] but see if satan can make you doubt this
[20:30] message
[20:31] he's got you defeated right right
[20:34] now i'm going to say it and you can
[20:35] think what you want to
[20:37] that's why most of the people are going
[20:40] to go
[20:41] by the graves
[20:44] is because
[20:46] not all age there's a lot of people 1900
[20:48] years old now
[20:51] not that
[20:53] it's because of
[20:55] letting satan
[20:57] pervert that word
[21:00] with just a little bitty antichrist
[21:02] saying
[21:05] all right and you know yourself that the
[21:07] basics of what
[21:09] after brother random priest about the
[21:13] so many times explained the water
[21:15] baptism
[21:19] and you didn't get into the seals and
[21:20] listen
[21:21] but what about matthew 28 19 yeah
[21:24] well you know what that means
[21:26] and brother reynolds so gracious to
[21:28] answer that you know why because that
[21:31] meant that person
[21:34] right there
[21:35] was deceived upon that point right
[21:39] but they wouldn't have asked the
[21:40] question right
[21:42] amen you understand i mean
[21:46] that's why questions are good
[21:48] right
[21:49] right because it lets us know
[21:51] we're ready
[21:53] all right and i love questions okay so
[21:56] let's get on to something
[22:00] i ended up by the life statement
[22:04] making it
[22:06] of what effect
[22:09] does it have on you
[22:12] to hear
[22:15] of these things that we've been talking
[22:17] about
[22:21] what effect does it have
[22:26] what are your thoughts
[22:29] well
[22:30] brother dale you mean everybody's lost
[22:33] never talked to that
[22:36] never said it you know
[22:40] well do you believe that
[22:41] lula's only what's going never taught
[22:43] that that's right
[22:45] never said that right
[22:49] what effect
[22:52] does it have
[22:55] now of course
[22:57] we think of our families
[23:01] we think of the loved ones
[23:03] right and things
[23:05] that don't believe like we believe right
[23:07] i'm sure
[23:09] we're human
[23:11] we're concerned
[23:13] of people friends and loved ones that
[23:16] you know
[23:19] that don't
[23:20] believe like you do
[23:23] you know yourself that
[23:25] if
[23:27] it would be good even sometimes if some
[23:29] of those people would just outlandishly
[23:32] you know ball you out
[23:34] as we'd call it you'd get over it
[23:36] quicker
[23:39] but they'll let us they said well i
[23:40] don't understand
[23:42] and that affects us it does me right
[23:46] but let's don't let it affect us so much
[23:49] that it makes us doubt the word
[23:53] we're human right
[23:56] i love everybody
[23:58] i want to see everybody say right
[24:04] what you see
[24:05] the word is what's right right that's
[24:07] right
[24:10] and we read enough there throughout the
[24:11] things talking to the antichrist we
[24:13] wrote around said see there anything
[24:16] contrary to the word that's right
[24:19] he's antichrist
[24:23] it's against christ which is the word
[24:27] and see if he can destroy our thoughts
[24:31] he has us defeated
[24:33] amen
[24:35] and we will go by the grave
[24:37] but somebody's not going to be arrogant
[24:39] and hateful
[24:40] bless god i'm i'm going to know what i
[24:43] am
[24:44] but that ain't even in the race
[24:47] okay is that plain enough
[24:49] that person ain't even in the race right
[24:52] that person needs salvation
[24:54] that's as plain as i can be
[24:56] well that's not the point
[24:59] that we think we're something great
[25:01] because remember the bible says whatever
[25:03] you are
[25:04] god made you right amen that's right
[25:07] that's right so then
[25:10] why don't we accept what he's done
[25:14] see because that's what you call mixed
[25:16] emotions
[25:18] out of one side of you you love people
[25:20] and want to see them saved
[25:21] but out of the other side of you you see
[25:23] that
[25:26] that they
[25:27] either won't or can't
[25:30] right receive what you have
[25:32] but does that make you want to lay down
[25:34] what you've got
[25:38] or does it make you want to go home
[25:40] because if you go home say remember
[25:42] somebody can't follow you
[25:44] but if you quit yourself they can't
[25:46] right
[25:48] i'm just trying to be honest and sincere
[25:50] in our hearts
[25:54] because it's very discouraging sometimes
[25:56] to hear that
[25:59] the things that go on around this
[26:00] message
[26:02] and it just makes you to where you want
[26:04] to just pull away
[26:06] and not have anything to do with people
[26:08] that's right
[26:10] but yet you realize that hey
[26:14] you got it somewhere
[26:16] right
[26:17] from somebody right
[26:19] and what if you're the only hoax they
[26:21] have yes sir
[26:24] now when we get down in a minute to this
[26:26] dark age
[26:29] i want you to remember one thing
[26:33] sure it was a very dark time
[26:35] horrible
[26:37] almost seemingly
[26:39] um
[26:40] total destruction
[26:42] but remember
[26:44] there was a little bride
[26:46] yeah bad that's right
[26:48] that's right a little ride there we'll
[26:49] get to that many where he said don't you
[26:51] hurt the northern lights
[26:53] he said if you cake them right around
[26:54] said even if you take them
[26:56] said don't you make them try to say any
[26:59] hail mary's
[27:01] he said kill them
[27:03] that's what he's saying we're ready
[27:06] he said kill him
[27:08] see that's god talking right
[27:12] that's right
[27:13] that's god speaking inside of it
[27:15] don't you you kill them but don't you
[27:17] make them
[27:19] don't try to make them doubt
[27:24] see because that's
[27:26] that little light
[27:27] always shined
[27:30] satan can't put that
[27:32] lord out matter how dark the ages got
[27:37] you remember it was so dark in egypt
[27:40] and it says that it could be felt
[27:42] something like that you know
[27:44] but you know it was light and goshen
[27:47] right
[27:48] there's lightning
[27:52] no matter how bad it gets
[27:54] like polycarp or something being
[27:57] burned to the state
[27:58] you know
[28:02] but yet in the last bit his
[28:05] soul was seen leaving
[28:07] in the form of a dove
[28:10] there's always been light so don't
[28:12] get disheartened about the darkness
[28:15] but i want you to think about the
[28:17] darkness of how dark it is
[28:21] and remember that darkness is here now
[28:30] honestly just just just let me talk to
[28:33] you
[28:34] you just
[28:35] you think about now
[28:40] when you like to see your family
[28:42] your friends
[28:57] but yet they can't see it
[28:59] that's right
[29:01] but remember one thing
[29:04] there are only hopes of ever seeing it
[29:07] lies in
[29:10] you what i was meaning there a moment
[29:13] ago
[29:14] and that combat beast here now in the
[29:16] bride is saying what
[29:18] come and see
[29:22] come and see
[29:25] we're the only hopes the world has
[29:28] amen
[29:30] you see us not always christ in us
[29:32] anyway that's right
[29:35] so think about that now as we continue
[29:37] on with the talk but i just wanted i
[29:39] wrote that down and what effect does it
[29:40] have on you
[29:42] to hear
[29:44] how horrible
[29:46] of a situation has existed
[29:49] in time
[29:51] see we we don't think about it
[29:55] we don't think about being
[29:57] well we're we're was raised in america
[29:59] we're
[30:00] irregardless of what we think about it
[30:02] still we have a freedom right now
[30:05] you know
[30:06] i mean we have a freedom that we can
[30:09] do and say and go and
[30:11] whatever
[30:12] what if you lived in countries where
[30:15] everything
[30:18] has told you
[30:21] i know brother reed doesn't mind me
[30:22] saying it but
[30:25] those people that took over that
[30:27] aluminum box out plant
[30:31] just to get a little bitty something so
[30:33] he would just
[30:34] you know when they needed a small item
[30:37] he would just
[30:38] and okay send somebody go get it you
[30:40] know
[30:42] you know
[30:43] keep shutting the platform
[30:45] we had authority just go get the stuff
[30:47] whatever it needed call in somebody get
[30:50] it fixed or something
[30:52] they said those people were so bound now
[30:54] this is this has been the working force
[30:58] so you can see how much it would be in
[31:00] the religious
[31:02] he said you tell us that we need this
[31:04] right here we need this park
[31:06] cost 50 or something
[31:09] why
[31:12] can you get along without it
[31:14] what would it mean if you don't buy it
[31:16] that's the way they talk
[31:19] i said we can't give you the okay to get
[31:20] it
[31:21] call back all the way over
[31:24] to the country that come from
[31:26] and have to go up the chain of command
[31:29] to finally get somebody that would say
[31:31] somebody
[31:33] we never existed like that right
[31:37] right
[31:39] we never existed in a religious
[31:41] situation
[31:42] that you couldn't
[31:45] believe the way you want to believe
[31:48] you know at least in our night time
[31:52] we've always been free to be able to
[31:54] kind of move and do it
[31:56] in the religious world
[31:58] we can talk about the pope
[32:01] but what if he was in some of those
[32:02] countries
[32:04] that if you spoke one word
[32:08] it was instant death
[32:12] and with no court of appeal
[32:18] see church we we can't comprehend
[32:22] what it would be like to be in such a
[32:24] darkness
[32:25] that's right
[32:27] of cain and his doings
[32:30] we just can't do it we
[32:32] we're not made that way we didn't would
[32:33] raise anyway
[32:36] and then we look at people instead of
[32:37] saying well look they're
[32:39] they're going to kill us one day
[32:43] well the bible said that they would kill
[32:44] you thinking they're doing god's service
[32:48] jesus spoke
[32:49] right
[32:51] what would be the horrible part of
[32:52] thinking about it then
[32:54] but now listen
[32:59] just remember
[33:01] that antichrist spirit is still riding
[33:04] that's right
[33:07] that red horse is still riding
[33:10] maybe here in america
[33:14] it is controlled by the
[33:16] governmental forces i've said a couple
[33:18] of times you know that you don't just go
[33:20] out and start shooting people they'll
[33:21] arrest you
[33:27] but just think of the darkness that's in
[33:29] this land
[33:30] i stood there at you likely years ago
[33:32] and
[33:33] you just
[33:35] you don't have to see i can see people's
[33:38] eyes
[33:41] that's what i do i mean
[33:43] i'm scanning looking at you in your eyes
[33:46] i can tell by your eyes what not what
[33:48] you're thinking
[33:50] but sometimes i can tell what you're
[33:51] thinking
[33:54] when you start going you know i pretty
[33:56] well know what you're thinking
[33:58] but
[34:01] i was looking at some people or a man
[34:02] standing on a street
[34:04] corner i said brother brady
[34:08] because that man don't have no hopes
[34:11] nope
[34:13] then he'd say well why don't you just
[34:15] get a ticket and come to america
[34:18] i said honey how are you gonna get the
[34:20] money
[34:22] you know that they would crawl up in
[34:23] those box at aluminum i thought they
[34:26] knew it was coming to i believe in saint
[34:28] louis or somewhere louisiana somewhere
[34:30] it was coming in
[34:32] and
[34:33] they would try to get enough food
[34:34] together and go in there and a lot of
[34:35] them died
[34:37] in the belly of those ships trying to
[34:39] make it to america
[34:42] and i did i said
[34:45] i said that man's a house look at him
[34:49] so you got a sparkle in your eye because
[34:51] you see jesus christ
[34:53] i said he's a religious person
[34:56] you know more now
[34:58] man he goes to church sometimes
[35:00] but in regardless he has no
[35:03] no hopes in his eyes
[35:05] he just see old luck
[35:10] and he'll be that away the rest of his
[35:11] life
[35:13] we've never been that way so it's hard
[35:15] to to think about it right but let's
[35:18] think on that a little bit
[35:19] trying to make these seals come down to
[35:21] where we're at where we can understand
[35:23] all right
[35:24] but we ended up we i think we might have
[35:27] read anyhow we want to worry about it
[35:29] the brother spoke of these things
[35:31] happening he said there'd be wars and
[35:33] rumors of wars
[35:35] and then he comes on over we picked up
[35:36] about the fifth we will jump on over to
[35:39] the number six brother
[35:42] bob
[35:44] number five right around said it the way
[35:46] he got his power the way satan got his
[35:49] power
[35:50] is that he connected
[35:52] all right
[35:54] council was held in the elected head
[35:56] bishop
[35:57] by doing this they united church and
[35:59] state together
[36:01] that's the only way he could do it
[36:04] was to get the governmental
[36:06] power of the state
[36:09] behind the action of the church
[36:13] you've all heard the story that
[36:16] the jews came to uh
[36:20] kennedy
[36:23] the old man kennedy
[36:25] he was a young ambassador
[36:28] yeah joseph
[36:30] and they asked for help and he liked him
[36:35] you've heard the story
[36:37] that the jew turned and said you and
[36:38] your family's cursed
[36:40] well whether it happened or not i don't
[36:43] know
[36:44] i do know by history that they did ask
[36:46] for help
[36:48] and that we wouldn't help them
[36:51] you know in the
[36:52] beginning because that was just that was
[36:55] the way it went
[36:57] but just like what if you
[36:59] had no hopes
[37:01] right
[37:04] you know
[37:05] in reality
[37:07] if you're lost today
[37:11] you have no hope
[37:16] if you don't have the baptism of the
[37:18] holy ghost
[37:19] there's no light in your soul
[37:22] it's as black as can be
[37:25] because there's no way to get any light
[37:26] there
[37:33] my brother around him would say he said
[37:34] you need the baptisms with the holy
[37:35] ghost more than anything in the world
[37:37] right amen amen
[37:39] you see that's the only light that there
[37:40] is
[37:42] in this dark age
[37:44] would be the light of the holy ghost
[37:46] dwelling
[37:50] so you didn't think about it
[37:53] in the time of darkness
[37:55] you and i have a
[37:57] opportunity
[38:01] to live in goshen
[38:06] but if we don't take that opportunity
[38:08] what do we do right
[38:10] we'll turn it down and we'll go into
[38:12] darkness
[38:14] there's no hope
[38:16] all right
[38:16] let's get over and start on this third
[38:18] seal
[38:19] and let's re-read it again i will pull
[38:22] it up number
[38:24] six
[38:27] and look what he says
[38:31] and when it opened the third seal i
[38:32] heard the third beast said hey come and
[38:34] see now the beast did come and see
[38:38] and then watch it a little bit it's not
[38:40] the beast
[38:41] that speaks next
[38:45] it's the lamb speaking right right
[38:49] the beast said come and see
[38:51] in other words i'm going to
[38:52] now show you
[38:55] what's taking place
[38:58] so come and see all right what do you
[38:59] see
[39:00] and i'll be held in the black horse and
[39:02] he that said on him had a pair of
[39:04] balances in his hand
[39:06] now that's a symbol right
[39:09] that's a symbol
[39:11] all right we'll get to that in a minute
[39:14] and he heard a voice in the midst of the
[39:15] four beasts
[39:17] say
[39:18] a measure of wheat for a penny
[39:20] three measures of barley etc
[39:23] so what is it saying
[39:26] let's go on to number six
[39:29] we'll start on the third seal
[39:35] okay fire out to
[39:40] 64. the third seal
[39:44] this writer is the same one
[39:47] but another stage
[39:48] of his ministry
[39:51] the first stage of white horsey
[39:53] he was just a teaching just an
[39:55] antichrist teaching
[39:56] he was against the word of god and now
[39:59] how can you be
[40:00] an enter now how can you be an
[40:03] antichrist
[40:04] anybody that denies every word of this
[40:07] isn't true
[40:09] and to be taught just the same
[40:11] is an antichrist
[40:12] because they deny the
[40:17] word and he's the word
[40:20] anybody teaching contrary
[40:22] to the word is antichrist
[40:26] but on this third stage he's in another
[40:28] ministry
[40:31] another stage of the church
[40:34] look at the next one which will be a
[40:36] long reading
[40:41] verb 273
[40:44] the same writer this first stage he was
[40:46] innocent and second now if you want to
[40:48] get a little bit higher a little more
[40:50] than that in the second stage the bible
[40:52] said he'd be given a crown and they
[40:54] crowned a man
[40:56] a superman they crowned him and then the
[40:58] bible didn't call him a pope bible don't
[41:00] say he's a pope right that's demystracy
[41:04] he's a false prophet all right the bible
[41:06] called him a false prophet well yeah of
[41:09] course he must be a false prophet
[41:11] by his antichrist spirit that started a
[41:14] taught antichrist against the original
[41:16] word
[41:18] because if you thought against the
[41:19] original word it was antichrist it was
[41:22] and the word is god's seek christ all
[41:24] right
[41:27] now after that we find him then crown
[41:29] when he got crowned
[41:31] but he's a very innocent helpless and
[41:33] he's backgrounding
[41:36] to bring it up to where
[41:38] the seal will open
[41:41] you you're going to see a book
[41:43] i've asked you to do it
[41:45] to read
[41:46] notice he spends
[41:48] a vast amount of time
[41:51] laying a background
[41:54] before he tells you what the seal is
[41:56] right sure
[41:57] that's not just playing around
[42:00] that's a background
[42:03] you see me background a lot
[42:06] i back up on the message prior
[42:09] why because they're all tight again
[42:12] so watch him
[42:15] he's just a little fella but then and i
[42:17] see him counseling the constantine gave
[42:19] him all the property and then what did
[42:21] he do then satan gave him his strong
[42:24] and authority
[42:27] nathan gave to this man this pope
[42:30] the bible said so
[42:32] as we have went through it now the next
[42:34] thing we find out that the devil
[42:36] controls all the politics
[42:38] that has ever been or ever will be
[42:40] we find that in matthew 4 11
[42:43] and now we find out
[42:45] that satan already had politics
[42:48] but he's trying to get to church
[42:51] and he already had the government
[42:52] because
[42:53] that's what he's saying but jesus
[42:55] remember when he was taken up he said
[42:57] i'll give you all of this
[42:59] because it belonged to that was the
[43:01] that was the governmental right that was
[43:04] the world the system the government's
[43:07] all governments all right now what does
[43:09] he want
[43:10] he's got to get the church
[43:12] but he's trying to get to church so he
[43:14] goes down to deceive it
[43:16] he gets his superman
[43:18] works him into an organization
[43:21] and crowns him background see
[43:23] of christ
[43:24] christ
[43:25] acted instead of god
[43:27] see this guy's a backer instead of god
[43:30] see just the same instead of god
[43:33] what he's supposed to be a viker under
[43:35] christ now
[43:37] we know he's not a viking to christ
[43:41] that would have been all right
[43:44] that he stayed down
[43:46] but that wasn't true
[43:49] now when he did that then what did he do
[43:52] then
[43:53] satan took his political power
[43:56] which he was already over you know
[43:58] governments
[44:00] and took the religious power which had
[44:02] already been crowned
[44:04] he put them together
[44:06] and he made him another crime
[44:09] over hell
[44:10] right and when they had passed on
[44:14] oh if they pay enough money
[44:17] you get them out see now he's biker over
[44:20] to heaven over purgatory as he wants to
[44:23] call it no such thing in the bible see
[44:25] but he added it to me
[44:27] but he had to make something the bible
[44:30] said he come out of the bottomless pit
[44:32] and he returns back the same
[44:34] on to that now what does he do
[44:36] he makes him another
[44:39] place called purgatory right
[44:43] now watch the darkness
[44:48] the catholic church ruled the world
[44:52] over what they called the dark ages
[44:55] for about a thousand years
[44:59] fleece to people
[45:02] of all their money
[45:05] all right
[45:08] charge you know we'll get to it in a
[45:09] second
[45:10] for prayers
[45:16] how horrible can anybody be
[45:20] they would charge you for a prayer
[45:25] now brother we want you to come down for
[45:28] joe and him
[45:30] george says gwen we went up yesterday
[45:31] and we dedicated her home
[45:33] beautiful home they got there man
[45:36] you get lost tonight
[45:39] i couldn't do which floor i lived on
[45:42] but anyhow
[45:43] we went down we prayed for it but
[45:45] wouldn't that be something
[45:48] they said well brother dale you you and
[45:50] the church come up
[45:51] dedicate her home
[45:52] it's gonna cost you
[45:54] yeah
[45:55] and it did because then they fed us like
[45:57] a king
[45:58] had two big old turkeys or big old hens
[46:01] or something cooked and
[46:02] food just running out every which way
[46:05] sure it is but
[46:06] wouldn't it be something to charge for a
[46:08] prayer yeah
[46:09] well my baby's sick well
[46:12] how much you give me to come down now
[46:13] you say now that ain't gonna happen
[46:23] that's why i run around and stay away
[46:24] from money
[46:26] because he knew what it was
[46:30] and wrong money
[46:32] love of money is the root of all
[46:35] not money
[46:36] no problem
[46:39] what you do with it
[46:40] right what about somebody would charge
[46:43] somebody to pray for
[46:50] people you go to funerals you do
[46:53] funerals you do weddings i know it's
[46:56] a kind of a customary thing to
[46:59] give the pressure of the money but
[47:02] i don't ever want it
[47:04] right i'd really give it back to the
[47:06] people that really needs it
[47:09] not the couple that's getting married to
[47:10] mom and daddy on each side
[47:12] they're the ones that need it
[47:14] give it to them
[47:16] all right
[47:18] but how horrible could you ever be
[47:25] that you charge at somebody for praying
[47:31] you don't get it
[47:33] but
[47:35] maybe they know what they're talking
[47:36] about let's go to number eight
[47:40] all right i've got a good bit of reading
[47:42] off of this one
[47:44] you'll notice this is a continual
[47:46] reading paragraph after paragraph
[47:50] paragraph 294 to 95 goes up to 300
[47:54] and now here is the mystery of this
[47:58] and that when it revealed to me early
[48:00] this morning poor daylight now that was
[48:02] this
[48:03] third seal
[48:05] you know what it was until then
[48:07] then i went quickly to the scripture to
[48:08] begin to look search it up here it is
[48:11] three of them so far has been absolutely
[48:14] supernaturally revealed
[48:16] that's right now here is the mixture of
[48:18] the black horse according to what it was
[48:20] revealed to me
[48:22] he had started writing in the time
[48:25] of the dark ages
[48:27] that's what the dark horse meant
[48:30] the dark ages
[48:32] which you'll see in a minute brother
[48:33] brown brings it to the
[48:34] in here to the tie tower in the middle
[48:36] age right when it got into the
[48:39] set this morning the moon just went
[48:41] almost out
[48:43] but there was no light
[48:46] he starts writing him in the time of the
[48:48] dark ages
[48:49] that's what the dark horse represented
[48:52] the dark ages where it was a time of
[48:54] midnight to the true believers
[48:56] that was left
[48:58] and it was some god
[49:00] it was even midnight
[49:02] horrible right
[49:05] watch now
[49:07] in that church age that middle church
[49:09] age
[49:10] our
[49:10] dark church age watch how
[49:13] he says
[49:15] you just have a little strength
[49:17] you read that in your fourth church
[49:21] it was a midnight to them for the
[49:23] midnight to them for the true believer
[49:28] now watch practically all hope had been
[49:30] taken
[49:31] from the true church
[49:33] by this fellow controlled both church
[49:35] and state
[49:39] we no such thing as saying well we'll
[49:41] just we can go down to the government
[49:43] and argue no
[49:46] you differed with them it's automatic
[49:47] debt
[49:49] and the guy got a prize for killing you
[49:56] they had a killing group there that i
[49:58] won't call the name of because it
[50:00] is in there but
[50:03] they just had a joy killing one man it
[50:05] recorded him killing a thousand people
[50:08] in one night
[50:13] a thousand people he killed
[50:16] now how many of them people did he pray
[50:18] for
[50:19] and ask him to get converted or what did
[50:22] he do
[50:22] he just went out and slit throats
[50:26] killed a thousand people
[50:28] one night
[50:31] what are they going to do
[50:33] see catholicism had taken over both
[50:35] church and state
[50:36] and all didn't agree with
[50:38] them because catholicism was killed
[50:42] that's the reason he was on a dark horse
[50:44] and watch what a dark thing he done see
[50:48] then he can see
[50:50] then you can see
[50:52] you just i if you know your history
[50:55] watch it
[50:56] and you well you won't have to even know
[50:59] get to know this
[51:00] and watch all hope was gone
[51:04] that's his black horse
[51:06] and he rode on his white horse
[51:08] hunting
[51:09] he gave power took pity slaughtered the
[51:11] minions that's what he was going to do
[51:13] as he rode on through and he still does
[51:16] it
[51:17] now here he is on the black horse now
[51:20] coming for dark age that was
[51:24] that time just about the time
[51:27] after the church got set up and got in
[51:30] power
[51:32] they smothered out everything else and
[51:34] went
[51:35] through about hundreds and hundreds and
[51:37] hundreds of years
[51:39] it's really a thousand years for what it
[51:40] was
[51:42] whatever readers know that was the dark
[51:44] age
[51:45] how many knows that sure the dark age
[51:48] there's your dark horse
[51:50] representing the dark age
[51:53] what's now
[51:55] now all hope's gone no hope at all
[51:58] everything looked dark for the little
[51:59] believers
[52:00] now that's the reason this call
[52:01] represented a dark horse do you get the
[52:04] symbol of the horse name
[52:06] but watch it
[52:09] killing the people was one thing
[52:15] but what's this here's where your
[52:16] darkness comes in
[52:18] his balances
[52:20] are scales in his hand
[52:22] you see
[52:25] called out
[52:26] now if you'll notice in your scripture
[52:29] he has the the scales
[52:33] says come and see
[52:35] he had a pair of balances
[52:37] in his hand
[52:38] well
[52:39] that wasn't too bad
[52:43] so god to let us know
[52:47] for sure
[52:50] he's the one that says a measure a week
[52:53] for a penny
[52:57] not even the combat beast
[53:01] the lamb cries this out
[53:04] because he wants us to know
[53:07] all right watch it
[53:09] keep that point in mind man
[53:12] he's balancing his scales in his ansi
[53:14] calling out a measure a week for a penny
[53:16] pre-leaders would barley for a penny see
[53:18] actually that yes wheat and barley is
[53:21] natural staff of life
[53:24] that's what bread and stuff's made from
[53:26] but you see he was charging for this
[53:30] they not only had the governmental
[53:32] charging for the bread
[53:36] right right
[53:37] i remember this you'll see him
[53:39] interlacing it
[53:41] he was actually charging for bread
[53:46] that's what run around will cover it
[53:47] watch it that's what bread is just made
[53:50] from
[53:51] and we don't go spiritual that's when it
[53:53] gets worse
[53:54] right what it means that he was charging
[53:58] his subjects
[53:59] for the kind of hope of life
[54:01] that he was sending out to them
[54:04] by making he started in that very time
[54:07] of making them
[54:08] pay for prayer
[54:11] charge it for prior
[54:13] they still do it
[54:15] no venus is that the way you pronounce
[54:16] the word
[54:17] no venuses
[54:20] of course what was he doing
[54:22] capturing the wealth of the world
[54:27] the scale weighing out a measure of
[54:29] wheat repenting and three measures of
[54:32] barley for a penny
[54:35] the writer on the black horse seed
[54:37] he was making stripping his subjects
[54:40] of their money
[54:42] when the bible predicts that he holds
[54:45] what
[54:46] the bible predicts that he holds about
[54:49] the wealth of the world
[54:53] and we said last night about russia and
[54:56] all that
[54:57] they just take all the money and just
[55:00] strip the people everything they got
[55:03] and run around said that was what caused
[55:08] communism to be like it was right
[55:14] that
[55:15] they were there fleecing the people of
[55:18] everything they had
[55:20] and he said communism rose up
[55:24] to stop
[55:26] that system
[55:28] of the catholic church
[55:31] you've heard him tell about little
[55:32] petito or what his name was little
[55:36] they got all these golden alders and
[55:38] these candles burning on them
[55:40] been over there in brazil and seen it i
[55:43] felt the excuse
[55:45] well it was in brazil too
[55:48] all these little things man it's just
[55:51] you're talking about
[55:53] uh we go down to look at the markets and
[55:56] see all this stuff
[55:58] and there it was you could buy any kind
[55:59] of candle you want any kind of thing
[56:03] to go burn for the dead
[56:06] we see they're taught if they don't do
[56:07] that right
[56:10] and all the catholics are wonderful
[56:12] people
[56:15] they make you pay for prayers
[56:18] right
[56:20] pay to pay
[56:22] mom and daddy out of purgatory
[56:27] you know that there's such good people
[56:28] you know what they do one time a year
[56:31] one day a year
[56:36] one day a year
[56:38] they have what they call all science day
[56:44] you know what that means
[56:46] everybody's prayers goes to father
[56:51] without extra charge
[56:53] so the poor can get his purse in
[56:57] to get his grandma out of purgatory
[57:03] all saints day that's what it's called
[57:06] all the prayers can go and i'm not
[57:07] joking you know just a hand a nose but
[57:10] i was there and witnessed them and you
[57:12] know i'm like i look around trying to
[57:15] figure things out
[57:16] they said oh this big old guy on this
[57:19] yeah and we have an all saints day
[57:23] i mean all the prayers goes up well the
[57:26] next day
[57:27] sorry you can't pay for it
[57:32] your prayers don't go through
[57:33] right
[57:34] that's no joke
[57:36] right it's true
[57:38] now wouldn't that be something
[57:42] it wouldn't be something to charge for
[57:43] prayer
[57:47] how much you paid
[57:51] the way we get down to the preachers in
[57:52] the end time
[57:54] if we have time
[58:02] now notice do you see where that whole
[58:04] money
[58:05] money taken in church
[58:07] comes from
[58:09] that's right now what's he saying
[58:15] the russians
[58:16] we need to ever service past the plate
[58:20] he's in service is not complete without
[58:22] passing the plate
[58:24] but now what's he talking about
[58:31] do you see where those old money-making
[58:34] money taken in church comes from
[58:36] get away from that stuff
[58:39] what i do to build an organization
[58:42] a big something
[58:44] a million dollars here and you see what
[58:45] the mother of it is
[58:51] there's not an organization in the world
[58:53] that don't have a great big headquarters
[58:55] of multi-million dollar
[58:57] buildings
[58:59] right
[59:04] pretty large within this message
[59:07] amen
[59:09] if you need it
[59:12] and can afford it
[59:15] praise the lord
[59:20] we could use a bigger build
[59:24] you know
[59:25] we could use
[59:26] more comfortable or something and that's
[59:28] fine
[59:34] but are we looking at the buildings are
[59:35] releasing god
[59:39] amen i mean
[59:41] you gotta
[59:44] sit uncomfortable here or
[59:47] are we too cold or too hot
[59:50] oh yeah we have all this other
[59:52] it's all right
[59:54] you talk to him
[59:56] thank you lord oh my i'm so glad yes sir
[59:58] all right it's been his grace that's all
[1:00:01] all right it's a midnight time
[1:00:03] do you understand that now
[1:00:05] and here he is charging for
[1:00:07] for the kind of life
[1:00:09] that's this barley and stuff natural
[1:00:12] it wasn't spiritual
[1:00:15] watch man
[1:00:16] now
[1:00:19] it was barley
[1:00:21] must have said watch him he's
[1:00:22] interlacing now they were charging the
[1:00:24] people for food
[1:00:28] all right that's one thing that might be
[1:00:30] all right
[1:00:31] but when you start charging for prayers
[1:00:34] right
[1:00:36] you know
[1:00:37] how the old saying used to be water was
[1:00:39] free
[1:00:53] look at
[1:00:55] barley bread and wheat bread
[1:00:57] he was charging for that kind of a life
[1:01:00] that he was giving to his subjects
[1:01:02] charging for the prayer
[1:01:04] charging for prayer
[1:01:06] by the priests to pray people out of
[1:01:08] purgatory
[1:01:09] charging them
[1:01:11] i'm taking this one out of history
[1:01:14] charging for i guess it's novena
[1:01:17] i guess everybody knows what novena
[1:01:21] i guess that's something you have to do
[1:01:23] you know
[1:01:24] some tenants coming out to charge for
[1:01:27] that
[1:01:28] bringing the wealth of the world to him
[1:01:30] and to himself into the church itself
[1:01:32] and he's still riding i'm sure he's
[1:01:34] still running
[1:01:37] look at it
[1:01:42] look at where he's down
[1:01:46] okay
[1:01:49] let's just put this one in here
[1:01:53] watch this one i've searched for this
[1:01:55] one
[1:01:56] the wording of it
[1:01:58] i knew
[1:02:00] what brother ryan said but i needed the
[1:02:01] wording to get out of the computer
[1:02:03] i searched it all
[1:02:05] yesterday and this morning
[1:02:07] and back here i finally picked it up
[1:02:08] while i go
[1:02:09] so we just start right here we're
[1:02:11] talking about the third beast that
[1:02:12] satan's in out

[1:02:28] the money-making scheme the shrewdness
[1:02:30] to get the gold of the world and the
[1:02:32] wealth brought into it

[1:02:37] began to charge for prayers
[1:02:39] and for
[1:02:40] make a place called purgatory
[1:02:42] and you prayed their ancestors and pray
[1:02:44] their ancestors out

[1:05:17] he was pulling them people for their
[1:05:19] money
[1:05:21] my one brother said one time he said
[1:05:22] i'll take
[1:05:23] the last hundred dollars from a woman as
[1:05:25] well as anybody
[1:05:27] who ever hears that you know i'm talking
[1:05:29] about it but he don't care i tell him to
[1:05:31] his face
[1:05:35] i was the one that made that statement
[1:05:37] right
[1:05:40] your prophet never went for money like
[1:05:42] that did he
[1:05:44] he fired a campaign manager because he
[1:05:47] took up an offering
[1:05:53] now they had free will offered they had
[1:05:54] love offerings
[1:05:57] but he fired one man because he took up
[1:05:59] an offering
[1:06:01] he said he did
[1:06:06] he said but brother tell us
[1:06:09] you gotta
[1:06:10] you know you you've got to do something
[1:06:11] to encourage people
[1:06:14] yeah
[1:06:15] i told you about it i was fixing to help
[1:06:17] support a brother
[1:06:19] and still sends me a lot of letters
[1:06:22] and i was interested in helping him on a
[1:06:24] foreign field and i won't mention word
[1:06:26] or what but
[1:06:29] we was in a meeting and that's something
[1:06:31] was said
[1:06:34] and he said
[1:06:36] yeah i said when we we have a services
[1:06:38] set
[1:06:39] we'll have people deliberately go to the
[1:06:41] altar
[1:06:46] did what
[1:06:47] he said yeah i said we'll send people
[1:06:49] down to the altar
[1:06:55] okay
[1:06:57] so people know all about these things
[1:07:00] he said because you got to get the
[1:07:01] people started once you get them started
[1:07:03] they'll come
[1:07:07] i went
[1:07:09] and i never gave them out of dime and
[1:07:11] never will
[1:07:13] because i don't believe in making up
[1:07:14] nothing
[1:07:16] they'll get together these meetings
[1:07:17] they'll tell doves hit under the thing
[1:07:20] and the preacher all these doves and how
[1:07:22] they go flying all over the place
[1:07:28] you think that old devil ain't still
[1:07:29] here
[1:07:30] he's riding this white it's red and it's
[1:07:32] black
[1:07:34] right he's getting pretty close to palm
[1:07:36] right
[1:07:37] but your prophet said that's what these
[1:07:39] evangelists do
[1:07:42] i'm calling his name but you remember
[1:07:44] when he got in trouble recently you know
[1:07:46] a year or so ago
[1:07:47] he was bringing in 130 something million
[1:07:50] dollars a year
[1:07:53] but if you turn it on to his broadcast
[1:07:55] what was it we've got to have money yeah
[1:07:57] we've got to have money send us so much
[1:07:59] money we've got we know that there's
[1:08:01] people out there right now sitting on
[1:08:03] thousands of dollars in your pocket and
[1:08:05] you need to come and get it because god
[1:08:07] will bless you if you don't give it he
[1:08:09] won't bless you
[1:08:10] your house is going to burn your cross
[1:08:12] is going to get destroyed
[1:08:16] it's that same old devil back there in
[1:08:17] the black darkness
[1:08:20] charging for prayers
[1:08:23] a day comes here when i gotta ask you
[1:08:24] for a dime
[1:08:26] this place won't exist
[1:08:29] it's never been on money right it never
[1:08:31] will be
[1:08:32] all right
[1:08:34] we've got to have money to live
[1:08:36] we got to do right
[1:08:40] but not to pull it out of people and
[1:08:42] scare them to death
[1:08:44] you know
[1:08:46] because that's that darkness right
[1:08:49] it's upon the land they came into the
[1:08:52] next one
[1:08:55] is the question answered on the seals
[1:09:02] our 291
[1:09:04] that's the only thing he could do
[1:09:05] there's only one thing left for this
[1:09:06] united states to do
[1:09:09] i hear people that say run around and
[1:09:11] said so until watch it
[1:09:13] now remember this is william brown see
[1:09:16] speaking
[1:09:18] this is my idea it's only presuming
[1:09:22] just look at it in the natural
[1:09:23] standpoint which may be a million miles
[1:09:26] off i do believe that right there in
[1:09:29] that money the love of money is the root
[1:09:31] of all evil and i believe right a long
[1:09:34] entire will start the ball rolling
[1:09:38] all right
[1:09:39] now the catholic church back there from
[1:09:41] charging for prayers
[1:09:43] and so forth holds wealth to the world
[1:09:46] you remember the bible said that she was
[1:09:48] rich
[1:09:48] and how she was and remember
[1:09:53] wall street
[1:09:58] and see you think it's just catholics
[1:10:02] she's rich in every nation there is
[1:10:04] under heaven
[1:10:05] she's reaching out
[1:10:07] watching
[1:10:09] she has the money
[1:10:14] what they don't have
[1:10:15] wall street has which is controlled by
[1:10:19] the
[1:10:20] jews
[1:10:24] the catholics have the
[1:10:26] gold the jews have the stops and bonds
[1:10:30] there's got to be a covenant between
[1:10:32] them that's right yes sir
[1:10:37] a natural jew is not going to give up
[1:10:39] his money
[1:10:40] all right
[1:10:43] so he's got to make a contract yeah
[1:10:46] you think about a darkness amen we're
[1:10:48] going to get dark when we get out of
[1:10:50] here
[1:10:51] that's right
[1:10:56] look at the next 323.
[1:11:01] and what does it say
[1:11:03] to this
[1:11:05] writer in black
[1:11:08] and we'll read it in a minute
[1:11:11] it's not the combat beast that says it
[1:11:14] it's the lamb it may be in this one here
[1:11:17] but what does it say to this writer in
[1:11:18] black
[1:11:19] don't you hurt my wine and my oil
[1:11:23] don't you touch my wine and oil now i
[1:11:26] got just a little bit of it down there
[1:11:28] but there's still a little bit there yes
[1:11:31] sir and you can go on go and measure out
[1:11:34] all kind of life
[1:11:36] that you're putting out
[1:11:37] that's up to you
[1:11:39] you're going to pay this is like god
[1:11:41] speaking
[1:11:42] you're going to pay for it down there
[1:11:45] but when you come across that wine oil
[1:11:48] you leave it alone
[1:11:50] you think he wouldn't die during the
[1:11:52] dark ages amen
[1:11:55] he was dire might have been that little
[1:11:57] light we talked about this morning
[1:12:00] but he was there
[1:12:02] don't touch my oil and wine
[1:12:05] first one the others would always the
[1:12:07] combat beasts that come and see and so
[1:12:09] and so come and see and so on
[1:12:11] now it says
[1:12:14] come and see
[1:12:15] but tell a voice from the midst of the
[1:12:17] comment at least it says in your
[1:12:18] scripture
[1:12:20] don't you hurt
[1:12:26] in other words like this
[1:12:28] if you catch some of my little flock
[1:12:31] that's filled with my oil and wine
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:34] wine and oil of the pure word
[1:12:36] and you're going to kill them
[1:12:38] because you you're doing that
[1:12:41] that's what you're doing
[1:12:43] don't you force them to say hail mary's
[1:12:46] or do anything like that
[1:12:48] are some of your creeds
[1:12:50] you keep your hands off them
[1:12:52] they know where they're going
[1:12:54] or they are anointed with my oil
[1:12:57] and by being anointed with my oil
[1:12:59] they have the wine of joy
[1:13:02] because they know
[1:13:03] my word of promise i'm going to raise
[1:13:06] them up again
[1:13:07] don't hurt what
[1:13:09] i'm going to raise them up again
[1:13:11] don't hurt that don't go trying to
[1:13:14] measure
[1:13:15] their message
[1:13:17] messing them up
[1:13:18] just cause just keep away from that in
[1:13:20] other words he's telling him
[1:13:23] you kill him
[1:13:26] but don't you try to make him say
[1:13:29] those things why because he was there
[1:13:33] watch it
[1:13:35] see what he says
[1:13:38] that's what i love about it
[1:13:42] surely that dark age those
[1:13:46] little sights down through their
[1:13:47] thoughts
[1:13:49] gone in here
[1:13:53] words are gone
[1:13:58] now
[1:14:01] let me say this about the end time
[1:14:07] don't you think in this day that most of
[1:14:09] the churches around this world
[1:14:12] in the message churches
[1:14:15] are wondering where god is at
[1:14:20] how many of you are wondering where he's
[1:14:22] at
[1:14:25] well brother dale if we had god among us
[1:14:27] we could just ask him
[1:14:35] what about it
[1:14:42] i've done read over and over and over to
[1:14:43] you god does those things to try you
[1:14:47] to see whether you're genuine or not
[1:14:49] right to see whether you'll stand or not
[1:14:55] what hopes would you have if you were
[1:14:56] out there
[1:14:58] trying to find a church to go to
[1:15:03] hey folks we ain't built lulu we never
[1:15:05] have so don't you worry about it
[1:15:09] i've always told you and i always have
[1:15:11] preached that there's more preachers
[1:15:13] around this world there's more churches
[1:15:15] following this truth than you can think
[1:15:17] of
[1:15:18] it's really trying right amen
[1:15:22] watch you just keep away from them
[1:15:26] he vindicates his words and bring
[1:15:29] it in they know
[1:15:31] they knew they'd rise again
[1:15:34] oh well i like that we
[1:15:36] they'll rise again you're cause of black
[1:15:38] horse riding now dark ages
[1:15:41] i went to white horse you've seen what
[1:15:42] he's done perfectly here comes a red
[1:15:44] horse you see what it's done
[1:15:46] here comes the black horse you see the
[1:15:47] same writer all the time
[1:15:49] what's he doing right on down through
[1:15:51] the ages you find out he measured it out
[1:15:54] at charge smart
[1:15:55] exactly weak natural
[1:15:57] natural light what they was living home
[1:16:00] but symbolizing
[1:16:02] spirit more
[1:16:04] enjoy the wine
[1:16:06] that spiritual life don't hurt them
[1:16:09] leave it alone in other words wrong
[1:16:10] don't you touch it it's mine that
[1:16:13] belongs to me what
[1:16:18] now i've got another thing here i want
[1:16:20] you to notice
[1:16:22] notice it was not one of the four beasts
[1:16:25] that said don't touch the oil in the
[1:16:27] wine
[1:16:30] watch it
[1:16:31] did you notice that the four beasts have
[1:16:32] been talking
[1:16:34] once let me just read out here just a
[1:16:36] little bit see a measure of
[1:16:39] a penny for uh when you prefer a penny
[1:16:41] and three measures of barley per penny
[1:16:43] and see i heard not the only one
[1:16:45] i look here
[1:16:46] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[1:16:48] four beasts what was it the lamb amen
[1:16:51] it wasn't the four beasts
[1:16:53] the lamb said why he said why he's going
[1:16:57] to take his own that belongs to him he's
[1:17:00] redeemed it see don't you touch that oil
[1:17:03] no sir not the four beasts but the lamb
[1:17:06] was the one that said it
[1:17:08] now oh my the lamb not the four beasts
[1:17:10] didn't announce this
[1:17:12] lamb said it itself
[1:17:14] when the 4b said come and see
[1:17:17] and they went and they sing it like that
[1:17:20] he said a measure of wheat for a penny
[1:17:22] mark but then the lamb cried out
[1:17:25] right among them and said don't you hurt
[1:17:28] the oil in mine
[1:17:30] oh my listen to it don't you
[1:17:32] hurt it boy or you're going to pay for
[1:17:35] it someday
[1:17:37] and they will
[1:17:39] they will that's right
[1:17:41] it'll be paid for one day
[1:17:44] you talk about a darkness you talk about
[1:17:46] a town that's coming
[1:17:49] right
[1:17:51] we think about being dark in egypt until
[1:17:53] they couldn't even move
[1:17:56] but there was light in motion
[1:18:01] those writers are still writing
[1:18:03] but brother dale we're out here we're at
[1:18:05] the time of the great revelation
[1:18:13] i agree with you a hundred percent
[1:18:17] but if it's not true revelation is not
[1:18:19] light
[1:18:20] right
[1:18:23] amen yep right
[1:18:28] the only thing we have how many times
[1:18:29] i've made this statement
[1:18:31] the only thing i have of the word of god
[1:18:33] is what's been revealed to me
[1:18:36] not what i've read in the book
[1:18:40] that's laying on the pages of the book
[1:18:42] and the prophet said
[1:18:44] can be questioned as long as laying
[1:18:46] there
[1:18:47] but he said when it's revealed into your
[1:18:49] heart
[1:18:50] it can't be questioned right
[1:18:52] that's right you see why i'm so stern
[1:18:54] about the way i am and the way i preach
[1:19:01] because it's in the book
[1:19:05] it's in the book right
[1:19:06] i've got the book i understand what it
[1:19:09] says
[1:19:10] and i believe it
[1:19:12] well who do you think you are
[1:19:15] well you know it's easy to reverse that
[1:19:17] statement and who do you think you are
[1:19:22] come and let's see
[1:19:25] let's talk about the message
[1:19:29] and see
[1:19:33] god has not left his little bride he
[1:19:35] didn't under dark ages
[1:19:38] he was right there with him that's the
[1:19:39] point i'm trying to get you to see
[1:19:42] we can see the symbols and the things
[1:19:44] but right out in the middle of the
[1:19:46] symbols the symbol is the
[1:19:48] the oil you know the
[1:19:50] measure of weak for opinion and things
[1:19:53] because that was the balances
[1:19:55] that the combat beast said come and see
[1:19:58] it's like all the others that was a
[1:20:00] symbol of it the dark ages the things
[1:20:04] but god speaks out
[1:20:08] he said
[1:20:09] don't you hurt my oil in my mind
[1:20:13] he was right there to make sure they
[1:20:15] didn't get hurt
[1:20:16] amen sure they were killed by the
[1:20:18] millions
[1:20:20] that's right
[1:20:21] but not one of them had to pray anybody
[1:20:24] out of purgatory that's right
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:28] no one of them had to pray anybody out
[1:20:30] and they didn't have to be prayed out
[1:20:32] right
[1:20:35] you just think how dark it would be for
[1:20:37] you setting listen to somebody that what
[1:20:40] if i had and you you really believe that
[1:20:42] i had the power
[1:20:44] as a preacher
[1:20:47] to be able to
[1:20:49] excommunicate you out of our fellowship
[1:20:52] which would mean you're lost
[1:20:56] that's what it means to be
[1:20:57] excommunicated that's correct day martin
[1:20:59] luther was put out of the catholic
[1:21:00] church his name went off the record
[1:21:02] right amen
[1:21:04] he wasn't one of them that they killed
[1:21:06] thinking they're doing god's service
[1:21:08] he was put off the record right
[1:21:14] what about the church
[1:21:16] trying to make it simple for me and you
[1:21:19] all right amen those horses are still
[1:21:22] here
[1:21:27] the white the red and the black are
[1:21:28] still here right
[1:21:31] can't be the pale until we get out of
[1:21:34] here right
[1:21:37] you can't get on that horse until we get
[1:21:39] out of here
[1:21:40] yeah
[1:21:42] so he's still sitting on his black and
[1:21:44] weight
[1:21:47] we'll read it from it prophet says you
[1:21:49] read the fourth seal he said
[1:21:52] we go up
[1:21:53] he comes
[1:21:54] down amen
[1:21:58] can't be the beast until we get out of
[1:22:00] here
[1:22:01] you think who's in control
[1:22:03] god's in control
[1:22:05] that's right but if we hit that third
[1:22:07] seal to think about him saying don't you
[1:22:09] hurt my oil in my mind
[1:22:13] i'm here
[1:22:16] and i'm here to show you you're not
[1:22:17] gonna hurt him right you may kill him
[1:22:23] but you're not gonna destroy him all
[1:22:24] right you're not gonna scare him with
[1:22:26] your little booger tricks of hell in
[1:22:28] purgatory
[1:22:34] that's why i've always tried my best to
[1:22:36] tell you mommas and daddies
[1:22:39] don't scare your children with heaven
[1:22:42] and hell
[1:22:47] don't scare them with boogerman tails
[1:22:54] don't tell them don't go in that dark it
[1:22:55] might be a booger man in there
[1:22:58] don't tell them stuff like that you're
[1:23:00] setting things in their mind
[1:23:03] you're scaring them to death
[1:23:08] get them in warfare and say don't go in
[1:23:10] there if you go in there i'll whip you
[1:23:13] right he ain't afraid of boogerman no
[1:23:15] more he's afraid of you
[1:23:20] don't scare them all right heard people
[1:23:22] tell them jesus don't love you
[1:23:25] you're doing wrong
[1:23:30] oh
[1:23:32] i want to get that person by the hair of
[1:23:34] the head and say let me talk to you a
[1:23:36] little bit
[1:23:38] jesus don't like you either
[1:23:44] but you see that's what we do
[1:23:48] let all them things trickle down
[1:23:53] until we become
[1:23:57] a horse
[1:23:59] that the devil is riding
[1:24:09] as i said this morning how many people
[1:24:11] in how many churches in this message
[1:24:14] will tell you if you leave them
[1:24:18] you're excommunicated
[1:24:23] you're lost
[1:24:27] turn around one time i ain't making a
[1:24:30] joke ain't making i'm telling the truth
[1:24:33] i heard a man one time that told a
[1:24:35] fellow he wanted to he was he'd backslid
[1:24:37] for years
[1:24:38] he said you pay your tithe up you can
[1:24:40] come back to church and be a member of
[1:24:41] us
[1:24:42] if you don't pay up your back time you
[1:24:44] can't be here
[1:24:49] would that be nice
[1:24:54] you tell me that ain't that same old
[1:24:56] devil
[1:24:59] he's charging for prayers and things
[1:25:07] but you see
[1:25:08] those people can say those things
[1:25:13] everybody thinks they're good people
[1:25:17] i just don't think that way
[1:25:20] i like what brother woodley said about
[1:25:21] it one time he said if my mama is the
[1:25:23] devil
[1:25:25] she's a devil
[1:25:28] well he wasn't meaning his mama was the
[1:25:31] devil it was at the moment what she was
[1:25:35] he wasn't throwing off on his mama
[1:25:38] right
[1:25:40] he was just saying if mama's a devil
[1:25:42] she's the devil
[1:25:46] what hopes do we have
[1:25:55] now how many people in this message
[1:25:59] did you know of because that's all we
[1:26:00] know about right
[1:26:04] why do they believe we're going to get a
[1:26:05] new body
[1:26:10] because they don't believe god is
[1:26:11] capable of
[1:26:13] making this one new
[1:26:18] well now you're controlled by those
[1:26:20] things
[1:26:24] what about the brother that preached the
[1:26:25] thunder virtue message
[1:26:30] he was going to tell you when you had
[1:26:32] certain virtues
[1:26:35] but of course
[1:26:37] the bigger payer in the pocket and the
[1:26:38] tide man was going to get the virtues
[1:26:41] quicker
[1:26:44] you say oh no oh yes
[1:26:50] why not just be sensible
[1:26:54] have i ever put that form of the thing
[1:26:56] before you here
[1:26:59] as a money scheming outfit or something
[1:27:04] to try to get your money
[1:27:07] no i give you all
[1:27:12] well because
[1:27:14] that money's got a bad taste to me
[1:27:19] your prophet said if you knew what you
[1:27:20] had in your pocket you take it out and
[1:27:22] burn it
[1:27:24] now he didn't do it
[1:27:27] right
[1:27:30] because he knew we we're living in this
[1:27:31] society
[1:27:35] but when you let your money
[1:27:37] get ahead of your will of god that's
[1:27:39] right amen you're doing wrong
[1:27:47] simple little things of thinking about
[1:27:51] darkness
[1:27:56] the bible says what now we ended up
[1:27:59] let's see if i can perforate it if that
[1:28:01] light is within you become dark that's
[1:28:04] with it
[1:28:05] how great is that darkness
[1:28:10] sure if we turn down this message
[1:28:14] we've gone into darkness
[1:28:22] but how many can do who can determine
[1:28:26] what turning down would be
[1:28:28] that's right
[1:28:30] when the great apostle paul said
[1:28:33] causing people to blaspheme
[1:28:41] it's what he said what he was doing
[1:28:42] that's right
[1:28:44] he said causing people to bless me
[1:28:47] you know god saved you
[1:28:53] that's why don't throw off on nobody
[1:28:57] i want grace for everybody
[1:29:01] especially for me
[1:29:04] but i don't want to be in that darkness
[1:29:07] but there's no
[1:29:08] hope would it be something if you had
[1:29:11] your eyes put out
[1:29:13] right amen once you're just in total
[1:29:15] darkness right yeah right you're at the
[1:29:18] mercy and
[1:29:19] i'm doing to somebody else right
[1:29:22] whether it be a cni dog or whether it be
[1:29:24] a
[1:29:25] person to lead you around
[1:29:30] i want to be under god's mercy don't you
[1:29:34] let's stand
[1:29:36] i want to be under god's mercy
[1:29:47] i want to be what he wants me to be
[1:29:55] what about it
[1:29:56] i want to live the way he wants me to
[1:29:59] live
[1:30:02] i want to be what he wants me to be
[1:30:05] think on these things
[1:30:07] just remember where we got here let's
[1:30:09] try that i want to live the way he wants
[1:30:11] me to live
[1:30:14] amen amen
[1:30:17] let me get inside here
[1:30:40] i want to get it
[1:31:05] let's get out of the darkness okay
[1:31:21] uh
[1:31:32] in the name of jesus
[1:31:43] i want to christ
[1:32:37] you know what we're going to do we're
[1:32:38] going down to
[1:32:39] for the baptismal service and all there
