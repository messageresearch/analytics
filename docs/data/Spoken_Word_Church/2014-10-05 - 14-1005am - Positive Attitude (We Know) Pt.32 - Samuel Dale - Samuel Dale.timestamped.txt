[7:57] guidance unto us we we pray that you
[7:59] would just be with each and every one of
[8:01] us today Lord God we need you and we ask
[8:04] you to just Open the Eyes of each one of
[8:07] our hearts that we may see you and be
[8:11] able to walk in your love and your grace
[8:15] and to be able to see you Lord in your
[8:19] word because to know you is life not
[8:22] even to know about you or any point not
[8:25] even to know your word letter by letter
[8:28] but to know You by Revelation is truly
[8:31] life to each and every one of us we love
[8:33] you and we thank you Lord and bless all
[8:35] of the ones that are not here today and
[8:38] we just commit everything to you in
[8:39] their Journeys and their things back
[8:41] home in Jesus name amen all right we'll
[8:46] go to
[8:48] Psalms
[8:51] 24
[8:52] and reading from verse
[8:56] 7 down
[8:58] to verse 10
[9:06] right let's go to verse six I didn't put
[9:08] it up there but this is the generation
[9:10] of them that seek him that seek thy face
[9:12] oh Jacob seei another words amen lift up
[9:17] your your heads oh ye gates and be you
[9:20] lifted up in ye Everlasting doors and
[9:23] the king of glory shall come in who is
[9:26] this king of glory the lord God the Lord
[9:29] strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in
[9:31] battle lift up your heads oh ye gates
[9:35] even lift them up ye Everlasting doors
[9:38] and the king of glory shall come in who
[9:41] is this king of glory the lord of host
[9:45] he is the king of glory amen you may be
[9:48] seated the Lord is at his Blessing if
[9:51] you have it in John go ahead and pull it
[9:53] up brother Anderson
[9:56] because we might read that I gave him
[9:59] one there and then I don't remember
[10:00] where I actually gave it
[10:04] but I want us to think about and to
[10:06] remember this because this is what we're
[10:09] going to be dealing
[10:11] with in John he says we
[10:14] know that whosoever is born of God we
[10:17] know he goes down to verse 19 and we
[10:20] know all right he goes down to verse 20
[10:24] and we know all right that's I just
[10:27] wasn't reading in Scripture I was just
[10:29] getting the point that we
[10:32] know all right now I like to think and
[10:36] talk about things that we know all right
[10:40] if I get that chair and pull it over
[10:41] here I promise my wife that I wouldn't
[10:44] hobble along and hurt because something
[10:47] happened the other day and uh I went to
[10:49] the chiropractor and they asked me what
[10:51] happened I said I reckon it's me cooking
[10:52] and and washing and doing all the
[10:55] ironing and things for my wife is messed
[10:58] up up my back but it wasn't that it's
[11:01] just something that it clicked and I've
[11:04] got a little burning in the leg and so
[11:07] you pray for me about that but if I pull
[11:09] the CH over here I promised her I
[11:11] wouldn't I got a good place to prop I
[11:12] can do a lot of things but I'm not
[11:15] worried about that I'm concerned about
[11:17] you know being able
[11:19] to speak to you what I know amen all
[11:23] right
[11:27] now Peter said
[11:30] in his talking one day he said I've been
[11:33] on the mountain he said I've been with
[11:36] the Lord
[11:37] Jesus I've seen these things he had
[11:39] spent three and a half years with him
[11:42] during his ministry and things like that
[11:44] but one day he
[11:46] said we have a more sure word of
[11:50] Prophecy all right
[11:53] now as I said I want to talk about we
[11:57] know and this follow me because I don't
[12:00] know which way I'll be going or what
[12:02] I'll be doing in the lineup I told them
[12:04] in the office there to hang on and we'd
[12:07] try to quote some but all right but
[12:12] see Jo I believe it was job that said I
[12:18] know my redeemer liveth amen all right
[12:21] when you're saying I know or we
[12:25] know that word no or k n o w no there I
[12:29] could put it there where the people
[12:31] wouldn't misunderstand
[12:32] me it's a very positive attitude now is
[12:36] that what we've been talking about for
[12:37] the quite quite a while the right mental
[12:41] attitude bringing it to a positive
[12:43] attitude all right and when you say I
[12:47] know now if you say I
[12:50] think that means things can be changed
[12:53] other things can be added etc etc but
[12:56] when you come down to say I know
[13:00] no then it's a very positive statement
[13:04] to be made all right when you say we
[13:08] know these things I like to talk about
[13:12] what I
[13:12] know but I don't mind telling you things
[13:17] that I don't fully know or
[13:20] understand all right because that way uh
[13:24] I can have a uh an open point to it
[13:29] but I want to talk about as I said Peter
[13:32] he said we have a more sure word of
[13:35] Prophecy all right now there's things
[13:38] today that we
[13:41] know and understand
[13:44] that down to time we had a lot of
[13:46] questions about right all right and I
[13:50] believe that was the reason we were
[13:52] talking about it last night the prophet
[13:53] was to be
[13:55] sent to where that we could come to a
[13:58] place
[13:59] place that we would not be uh left you
[14:03] know you remember he came to the to the
[14:06] Jews and then he appeared to the
[14:09] Samaritans you know the high Jew and
[14:12] Gentile but he never came to the
[14:14] Gentiles until the last days into
[14:17] bringing the understanding but in this
[14:20] coming it was not a physical coming of
[14:23] his body to the people but it was a
[14:26] spiritual coming through the revealed
[14:29] word that he promised that he would send
[14:32] us a prophet to bring the word unto us
[14:34] and that's why we believe it that way
[14:37] all right see but then in doing it that
[14:40] way he brought it to us in a very
[14:43] special
[14:44] way uh really I had rather be where we
[14:48] are
[14:49] today in the opening of the word than to
[14:53] have been back there when the Lord Jesus
[14:55] walked on the shores of
[14:57] Galilee all right
[14:59] because if I did then I would be like
[15:02] Peter I would be thinking about what I
[15:04] know or talking about what I know or
[15:08] talking about what I seen or or I was
[15:11] there when the prophet preached this or
[15:13] I was there when the dead was raised I
[15:15] was D when these things all that's well
[15:17] and
[15:18] good but a personal experience is
[15:22] greater than all of those things you
[15:25] could be talking about all right so then
[15:29] in saying that I know that means we
[15:33] we've sat down and we've considered the
[15:37] matter and we know what it is and by
[15:41] saying that you
[15:42] know oh I was trying I remember whether
[15:45] it was last night or not but I guess it
[15:49] was you know if you tell somebody
[15:51] they're
[15:52] wrong you know be ready to prove they're
[15:56] wrong right amen now
[15:59] see everybody say well I believe you're
[16:01] wrong well show me where well I don't
[16:03] know how to show you but I just believe
[16:06] you're
[16:06] wrong well now
[16:09] that's you know that doesn't fit even in
[16:11] the human
[16:13] vocabulary because if you're going to
[16:15] tell me I'm wrong I want you to show me
[16:19] that I'm wrong if not you're just uh
[16:23] trying to impress
[16:26] me or trying to scare hear me are trying
[16:30] to impress people that are
[16:32] around to say well you know brother Dale
[16:36] says so and so but I believe it this way
[16:40] or even for you to say uh you know
[16:42] brother Dale says so and so but I just
[16:45] don't see it that way we say
[16:48] okay now tell me why oh I don't want to
[16:52] cause trouble you just
[16:55] did you opened the can of beans it's
[16:58] done and they're going to spoil if you'd
[17:01] left them in the can it might have been
[17:03] all right but you've opened it up if
[17:06] you're going to tell something then and
[17:08] like I've always said why not come to me
[17:13] first and then we can sit down and
[17:15] discuss things and that way we can know
[17:18] it but people are not going to do that
[17:21] they're going to run their mouth and
[17:23] then they're going to you know like you
[17:25] know how I've always Illustrated it you
[17:27] know that somebody say uh brother Dale
[17:32] brother maybe brother collie you know
[17:34] I'd say brother collie watch brother
[17:36] Mark got against you oh forget it not
[17:38] forget it I shouldn't have brought it up
[17:40] there's no
[17:43] problems you just created one right all
[17:49] right see then that's the way we do I
[17:52] didn't say
[17:55] that
[17:56] well you know
[18:00] but
[18:01] now I've preached quite a while on some
[18:04] different things about the positive
[18:05] attitude and brought down some
[18:07] situations and and tried to cover some
[18:10] things and I want to get this part out
[18:13] of the way and move on because I want my
[18:16] I don't know I may start a series this
[18:18] afternoon on something that is right
[18:21] behind this I really don't know uh Which
[18:25] Way but we'll go over which way the Lord
[18:27] leads
[18:29] but I want to make myself clear on some
[18:32] things and all and
[18:35] then to say to you I
[18:38] know all
[18:39] right then we can cover what we know and
[18:43] then what we don't know I don't mind
[18:45] saying I don't
[18:47] know right I I don't mind that at all
[18:51] because I can be helped all right even
[18:55] after all of the years that I preached
[18:57] on Daniel 70 weeks and bringing it out
[18:59] until it stands until this day as to not
[19:02] being destroyed by anyone there's still
[19:05] some questions in my
[19:07] mind that are not totally clear because
[19:10] I'm a human
[19:11] being I don't mind saying
[19:14] that yeah but you were sure strong
[19:16] enough yeah I'm strong on what I
[19:19] believe what I know I'm glad to tell
[19:23] you all right but what I don't know I'm
[19:26] glad to tell you don't know if was here
[19:28] he life and say the first time he called
[19:31] me he thought he was going to call a guy
[19:33] that knowed everything and he asked me a
[19:36] question and I can't remember now what
[19:37] the question was he can but he asked me
[19:40] a question I said brother Aaron I don't
[19:42] know he said well everybody told me you
[19:45] know everything I said well everybody
[19:48] ain't right because I don't know
[19:51] everything all right but
[19:54] now we've talked a lot about the Plan of
[19:57] Redemption
[19:59] and the way things go in in our journey
[20:02] and so bear with me as I try to struggle
[20:05] between uh thoughts without having to
[20:08] spend so much time because we've already
[20:11] gave a lot of quotes and a lot of
[20:13] thoughts but there is a problem of
[20:17] understanding between you know a lot of
[20:20] things about the Old Testament Saints in
[20:23] relation to the New Testament
[20:26] Saints and you know that that's what I
[20:28] want to
[20:31] cover and we'll talk about it in the
[20:33] bases of what we know all right
[20:40] now we know for
[20:44] certainty that the Old Testament
[20:48] Saints in
[20:50] Paradise did not have eternal
[20:54] life all right we know because Jesus
[20:57] hadn't died
[20:58] right strike it all see why is it I
[21:02] believe so and so I've got a quote where
[21:04] the Prophet said about Elijah sure have
[21:07] I've G it to you before where Elijah
[21:09] said as thy soul
[21:11] liveth and he may talk about eternal
[21:14] life but just remember that those Old
[21:18] Testament
[21:19] Saints they could not go into the
[21:22] presence of
[21:24] God brother B says on questions and
[21:26] answers paragraph 3 you can pull some of
[21:29] these up if you'd like brother brandham
[21:31] said they were in a place like
[21:37] Dreamland Paradise was a place like
[21:39] dreamland it was a place where the
[21:41] people went to now listen here is how
[21:45] technical it
[21:47] gets all the Old Testament
[21:50] people that died didn't go to
[21:55] paradise that's right because you got to
[21:57] remember one thing Paradise was taken up
[22:00] right there's still some people from the
[22:02] Old Testament that will have to come up
[22:04] in the general
[22:06] Resurrection now where they are today I
[22:10] don't
[22:11] know maybe you do I don't know but see
[22:15] they wasn't in Paradise cuz if it' been
[22:17] in Paradise it' come up all right now
[22:20] there's a lot of people there that you
[22:21] got to you know that you don't know
[22:24] where they're at and what they're doing
[22:26] uh I'm not going to put them in hell
[22:29] I'm certainly know not to do that but I
[22:32] don't know where a lot of those people
[22:34] because the Bible says many of the
[22:37] people in brother B emphasized that not
[22:39] all the Old Testament people
[22:42] raised well now where are those people
[22:44] today and what they're doing I don't
[22:47] know there's a lot of things I don't
[22:50] know all right I don't know where the
[22:54] body of Elijah is right right
[22:58] but yet he went up in the
[23:00] Chariot I don't know where the body of
[23:03] Enoch is but yet he walked off the earth
[23:08] I don't know where the body of Moses
[23:10] is and brother Brown said speaking it he
[23:14] said I actually don't think he was
[23:17] buried now that's just because the Bible
[23:19] talks about the the that the devil wants
[23:21] to know where he's buried at brother
[23:23] said frankly I don't think he was buried
[23:26] you know all right but where are those
[23:29] bodies and remember those bodies went
[23:36] somewhere and their soul was somewhere
[23:38] before Jesus
[23:40] Christ come to empty up Paradise amen
[23:45] all right so now you're dealing with
[23:47] some things you don't know but you do
[23:50] know it happened all right everybody
[23:52] follow me you know it
[23:55] happened because the Bible said it
[23:57] happened and the prophet said it
[23:58] happened I can even show you and this in
[24:00] one of the quotes we use today where
[24:02] brother Rand said that Enoch was in
[24:10] Paradise but see I don't I don't
[24:12] understand all of that I have no
[24:15] problems with saying I don't
[24:17] understand but my point is where are
[24:22] they and what happened to
[24:25] them and what happened to them in ation
[24:28] to Jesus Christ because that was before
[24:31] Jesus Christ was crucified that was
[24:34] before the atonement that was before
[24:37] this scripture that we read of open up
[24:40] the Everlasting Gates the king of glory
[24:41] go in that was before so there's some
[24:44] things I don't
[24:46] understand but there are some things I
[24:48] do
[24:49] understand I understand that the Old
[24:51] Testament Saints when they went to
[24:53] Paradise when they
[24:55] died you know some of them
[24:58] the ones that were brother rown called
[25:00] it the
[25:01] Justified that's the words he Ed for the
[25:03] ones that went into Paradise go like I
[25:06] said it could you can't put them all
[25:07] there because if he did you'd empty up
[25:09] Paradise well where's these left so you
[25:12] got a problem all
[25:15] right we know that those Old Testament
[25:18] saints went to
[25:20] paradise and we know that they were not
[25:23] in the presence of God that's right all
[25:27] right
[25:28] but
[25:29] yet the prophet would say they were in
[25:33] his
[25:35] presence cuz there's what we miss what
[25:37] is the presence of God you realize that
[25:41] if we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[25:43] places in Christ Jesus today we're in
[25:45] the very presence of
[25:47] God I can show you where that paradise
[25:49] was the presence of God that heaven is
[25:52] the presence of God that the souls under
[25:54] the altar is the presence of God that
[25:57] the
[25:58] um bride in the F the sixth Dimension is
[26:02] in the presence of God all right so then
[26:06] what is the presence of God God can be
[26:08] in every Dimension that there is and in
[26:11] the sixth Dimension there has to be many
[26:13] they got to be
[26:14] seven uh whatever you call them
[26:17] spaces whatever because when brother
[26:19] Brandon went beyond the curtain of time
[26:21] he didn't see Paul and all of those
[26:22] others so each one of those would be in
[26:25] the presence I believe Martin Luther is
[26:27] beyond the curtain of time in the
[26:29] theophany in the presence of
[26:32] God because that's where we miss it by
[26:34] just relating something and we'll read
[26:37] that run around and say they're in the
[26:38] presence of God and then when we do we
[26:41] just anchor that down what is the
[26:44] presence of
[26:47] God all right then in doing
[26:51] it we see that they went into the
[26:53] presence of
[26:55] God in the
[26:59] Paradise but not the presence of God
[27:02] like went to him and took them
[27:03] out don't you think they were in the
[27:05] presence of God in Paradise they were
[27:07] happy they were being taken care of but
[27:09] they were not
[27:11] Eternal all right and you know that
[27:14] Samuel was in paradise and run around
[27:16] covers it that's why the witch of Endor
[27:18] could call him
[27:20] up because the blood of Jesus Christ had
[27:22] not been shed yet and Samuel was in
[27:25] Paradise that's a demon
[27:28] ology E30
[27:30] demonology that he could be brought out
[27:32] of
[27:36] that and appear to to Saul and tell him
[27:40] you know by the witch of Endor but he
[27:42] said you can't do that now he said
[27:45] because that was not under the blood of
[27:47] Jesus Christ he said but now under the
[27:49] blood of Jesus Christ he said don't you
[27:51] talk about this all that you see and all
[27:54] of these things about you see this and
[27:56] you see that you know he said you get
[27:59] into the wrong thing all right but we
[28:02] know that they were not
[28:06] Eternal in
[28:08] Paradise the Old Testament Saints
[28:11] because Jesus Christ had not died all
[28:13] right now that solves that problem when
[28:15] I say things we say that we know we
[28:18] don't have no problem with
[28:21] it but we know that Jesus Christ died on
[28:25] the
[28:26] cross
[28:28] right amen we know he died on the cross
[28:32] all right and we know that the Bible in
[28:35] reading it without continually following
[28:40] it you'll see that you'll that and even
[28:44] a quote from brother brandom that said
[28:47] when Jesus died on the
[28:49] cross and said he hollered with a loud
[28:53] voice and said to grav
[28:56] opened
[28:58] and many of the Old Testament Saints
[29:01] came
[29:03] forth all
[29:05] right well see it looks like then right
[29:07] while he's doing
[29:09] that but according to Matthew
[29:12] 27 about
[29:14] 53 it said many of the Old Testament
[29:17] saints come
[29:18] out
[29:20] after or in at the time of his
[29:23] resurrection all right now from the time
[29:25] of the loud voice on the
[29:29] cross to Jesus's resurrection is
[29:32] somewhere in the capacity of about three
[29:34] days
[29:36] right not exactly to the point but
[29:38] somewhere close to a three-day Point all
[29:41] right so the graves didn't open
[29:44] according to the
[29:45] scripture until the resurrection of the
[29:48] Lord Jesus go remember first he had to
[29:51] go get
[29:52] him he had to go down to
[29:55] Hell and preach to those people that
[29:58] were lost to be a witness but then he
[30:01] went over to
[30:03] paradise and was to them and brought
[30:07] them out of
[30:09] paradise all right now
[30:12] remember the body of the Old Testament
[30:15] Saints was not in
[30:17] Paradise it was in the grave okay it was
[30:21] in the grave all right now so we know
[30:24] that we're not correcting things we're
[30:26] just putting it in the right
[30:29] perspective brother ROM knew the
[30:33] scripture that they raised at his
[30:35] resurrection so you got about three-day
[30:38] period And I told my wife when I was
[30:40] thinking on this I said what's so
[30:42] wonderful about that you know we talk
[30:45] about the the shout the voice to the
[30:47] Archangel and the trumpet and you know
[30:49] that we talk about being in the time of
[30:51] the voice of the Archangel which is the
[30:53] Bride of Jesus the Jesus Christ and his
[30:56] bride to call fall forth the dead you
[30:58] know that's a progressive Point see it
[31:01] was like 3 days back there wasn't matter
[31:03] how long it is here I thought that's
[31:05] wonderful Lord word that we can think
[31:07] about that that it didn't just it look
[31:10] like that the graves opened immediately
[31:12] with the
[31:15] earthquake but remember there was an
[31:17] earthquake when he
[31:18] died there was an earthquake when he
[31:20] raised right all right now we're in the
[31:23] scripture we know all right so then when
[31:28] those Old Testament saints come forth
[31:30] with
[31:31] him they had to be first brought from
[31:38] Mortal right that's right because they
[31:40] were not
[31:43] Eternal in Soul their soul was their
[31:46] being you can call it their theophany
[31:48] because that's your being that's what
[31:50] you are the person you are all right but
[31:54] see first off then Jesus had to bring
[31:56] them to a
[31:58] place of eternal life in soul and I
[32:01] believe he
[32:03] did I believe when he took those people
[32:06] out of
[32:07] paradise he brought them into an eternal
[32:11] condition in
[32:13] Soul all right cuz that was the first
[32:15] thing but remember their bodies was not
[32:17] there the body was in the grave all
[32:20] right so then when you get to that point
[32:23] then there's where you're going to have
[32:26] problems in thinking about the the
[32:30] things
[32:32] of their bodily raising and that's where
[32:35] the the problem with the understanding
[32:37] of people is that you know and I'm not
[32:40] saying I fully understand it this is the
[32:42] one of those things I'm going to tell
[32:44] you that I'll tell you both sides and
[32:48] then I will
[32:50] say maybe I don't
[32:54] know all right because
[32:57] most to keep it in the right order and
[33:00] to
[33:01] understand we've got to follow it
[33:05] correctly all right but we
[33:08] know the dead raised right
[33:12] right all right we
[33:15] know that they appeared in the
[33:18] city right all right and was seen of
[33:22] many the Bible says it the prophet says
[33:26] it now what kind of a body were they
[33:30] in when they
[33:33] raised they
[33:35] right brother Brandon said they're
[33:37] raised in Immortal
[33:41] bodies
[33:47] okay he says they raised
[33:50] in maybe I don't remember exactly the
[33:53] word corporal but real bodies the bodies
[33:56] of they lived
[33:59] in and he actually says he said
[34:03] job said and just a spoonful of IES left
[34:08] when Jesus brought him out of
[34:10] paradise coming
[34:13] out and brother Brown says
[34:17] remember that job said I know my
[34:19] redeemer liveth and in the last days he
[34:21] said
[34:23] plural I be talking about 2,000
[34:28] but I believe job raised with the Lord
[34:33] Jesus I believe
[34:36] that but I now I've got the other side
[34:39] of
[34:40] it
[34:42] that job said and I've got the quotes
[34:44] from The Prophet laying
[34:46] here that job said I
[34:49] know my redeemer liveth and in the last
[34:52] days and brother BR said the last 2,000
[34:56] years
[34:58] job will
[35:01] raise
[35:03] right now you got one statement is
[35:05] saying that he raised back there and one
[35:08] statement it says he'll raise over
[35:12] here I believe
[35:15] it but I can't put it
[35:19] together in a right
[35:21] understanding because to make it a
[35:25] statement this is it
[35:27] careful when you say I know that's what
[35:30] I'm saying today listen very
[35:32] carefully when I tell you what is right
[35:36] I will say I
[35:38] know all right now and I don't mind
[35:41] saying I don't
[35:44] know right all
[35:47] right those Old Testament Saints did
[35:49] they raise in literal bodies we know
[35:52] they're raised in a body enough to be
[35:54] able to be
[35:55] seen
[35:58] we know that but here's a point that we
[36:02] miss we think of the off can't be seen
[36:07] yes sir now I've got the quotes laying
[36:11] here we've given them before so there's
[36:13] no need of it Moses
[36:16] saw the theophany of Jesus you agree
[36:20] that's what your Prophet said you
[36:22] remember it said it looked like the back
[36:23] part of a man right all right
[36:27] so theop can be seen if God desires it
[36:31] to be brought into position what about
[36:34] the man on the road out there that was
[36:37] hit by the
[36:39] car and even the car lunged and even
[36:43] many multiple Witnesses saw the car
[36:46] lunge saw the body go up in the air and
[36:49] they went back and they couldn't find
[36:50] the
[36:54] man see we think about a theophany is
[36:57] not being able to be
[37:00] seen but yet brother brandom will call a
[37:02] theophany a glorified body right an
[37:06] immortal
[37:09] body
[37:11] right those those Saints beyond the
[37:14] curtain of time he was able to see them
[37:17] feel them talk to them hear them must
[37:19] have been pretty
[37:22] real so we know for
[37:25] certainty that
[37:27] when they raised in that theophany they
[37:30] were capable of being seen right all
[37:35] right now we know
[37:38] also a point
[37:41] that's
[37:43] questionable but we know from the future
[37:45] home that brother Bram says there was
[37:48] three raptures in the Old Testament and
[37:51] there was three raptures in the New
[37:53] Testament all right and he said it was a
[37:56] elah Enoch and Jesus that's
[38:00] right of the Old Testament said because
[38:03] he's the
[38:05] Keystone all right he said now one
[38:07] Rapture of the New Testament is taking
[38:09] place which was the Old Testament
[38:12] saints that come up with
[38:16] Jesus now we know for a
[38:19] certainty that there has to be a
[38:21] two-part thought of Jesus and his
[38:25] resurrection
[38:27] amen because he
[38:33] raised in his
[38:35] resurrection and appeared to
[38:39] Mary but he said don't touch me I'm not
[38:42] yet ascended that's
[38:44] right he said but I go he didn't say
[38:47] everybody he said I
[38:49] go to my father and your father all
[38:53] right that's the
[38:54] morning of the Resurrection that evening
[38:57] the Bible says just down below there in
[38:59] the evening he appeared back among them
[39:02] and said feel my hands and my feet Etc
[39:05] all right so we know he went
[39:07] up but we know also that the Old
[39:10] Testament Saints desired to be in
[39:14] Jerusalem and he says I'm going to be
[39:17] make a little Whistle
[39:19] Stop well he did the first one CU he
[39:22] went up and come right
[39:24] back all right but when he came
[39:28] back then the Old Testament Saints could
[39:32] have been around here for 30 40
[39:35] days you remember that's right they said
[39:38] we got to get out of here because we've
[39:39] been recognized right all right so now
[39:43] I'm laying the whole story out let you
[39:45] think about
[39:47] it cuz there's some things there I don't
[39:53] know I I don't fully understand their
[39:56] resurrection of the Old Testament
[39:59] Saints in comparison to the rest of the
[40:03] scriptures but neither do I and have
[40:06] never made it that they just raised in a
[40:08] theophany I asked a
[40:11] question or whether it was a theophany
[40:14] can we know for certain one
[40:16] thing they did come from Mortal to
[40:19] immortality in
[40:21] Soul that we
[40:23] know all right and when they raised and
[40:27] they were here for a while then they
[40:29] went up see then this
[40:31] scripture comes into
[40:35] view you remember in the book of
[40:37] Acts it doesn't cover in the book of
[40:39] Acts that they went up with
[40:43] him but if they didn't immediately go up
[40:45] with him in the first part and that
[40:47] would have been only just a small amount
[40:49] of time then the Old Testament Saints
[40:52] wouldn't have been able to have pered
[40:53] very
[40:55] long
[40:56] so then you got the Old Testament where
[40:58] Jesus went up in a
[41:01] Rapture but now check the message that
[41:04] he's speaking of he is not speaking of a
[41:07] resurrection in the future home
[41:10] message he said the Old Testament saints
[41:13] went up in Jesus's
[41:18] Rapture all right so he was raptured
[41:21] up and came
[41:24] back then he was raptured up in the book
[41:27] of Acts
[41:28] one all right you remember the angel
[41:31] said why he stand you gazing cuz he went
[41:34] away he'll come back the same way said
[41:35] is what he's going to come back he's
[41:37] going to come back with the Saints you
[41:39] know all right now then in dealing with
[41:45] it we look at it as a point of things
[41:48] that we
[41:49] know but things we we can't make a
[41:52] definite point
[41:54] on because as I was covering about
[41:57] job you can have him raising back there
[42:00] and you can have him raising over here
[42:03] all right like I said about Elijah and
[42:06] Enoch and Moses where did their bodies
[42:09] go I don't know but I do know where the
[42:13] Old Testament saints
[42:16] went all right because they went with
[42:19] Jesus you agree all right so now you see
[42:23] the point in between that there are some
[42:26] problems that I don't understand I don't
[42:28] mind admitting
[42:29] it did they raise strictly in theop
[42:35] bodies
[42:38] there or did they raise in literal
[42:42] bodies I don't
[42:45] know I know that Elijah and Enoch and
[42:49] Moses they went
[42:52] somewhere but it doesn't cover where
[42:54] they
[42:55] went but it does cover where the Old
[42:58] Testament saints
[43:01] went that I
[43:04] know so then we can follow it from a
[43:06] point of I know because see when he came
[43:11] back then he appeared for 30 40
[43:15] days right and then he went
[43:20] up all right so then the Old Testament
[43:23] Saints would have had to went up at that
[43:24] raising because that
[43:27] is not the
[43:29] first Rapture of Jesus which would be of
[43:33] the Old Testament to be the
[43:36] Keystone but it would be the first of
[43:38] the new to make the Keystone between the
[43:40] old and the new to be correct then he
[43:42] could take up those Old Testament
[43:44] Saints all right now I will say it this
[43:48] way I do not
[43:50] believe and have taught it that those
[43:53] Old Testament Saints raised
[43:57] in human bodies that were made Eternal
[44:01] in the
[44:03] resurrection maybe you do that's up to
[44:06] you the reason I don't believe it is I
[44:08] made it plain why is
[44:12] because the Bible
[44:14] says that no man hath approach to
[44:17] immortality but Jesus
[44:20] Christ all right but I love the rest of
[44:23] that scripture but it says life and
[44:26] immortality is brought to
[44:29] light through the gospel right amen all
[44:32] right I believe one day we'll understand
[44:35] a lot of
[44:37] things because it's brought to light all
[44:40] right but taken to
[44:44] immortality you know mortal bodies
[44:46] immortality means mortal bodies made
[44:50] Eternal all right mortal means death
[44:52] doomed human bodies all right we'll get
[44:55] to that that later on in the in the
[44:58] message part this afternoon all right
[45:02] now see then as those Old Testament
[45:06] Saints
[45:08] raised they raised in and brother around
[45:11] calls it a bodily
[45:13] form he calls it a glorified body he
[45:17] calls it an immortal
[45:19] body but you know one time he said that
[45:22] even a sinner had an immortal
[45:24] body right run you quote
[45:29] see now you got to know that he's not
[45:32] talking about a sinner in
[45:34] Eternal so he's referring to
[45:38] what a person a human
[45:43] being is in the image of God it no
[45:46] matter whether he's lost or saved and
[45:48] his soul is in the very image of his
[45:52] maker even our bodies are made in that
[45:55] image
[45:57] part that he's doing but I'm just giving
[46:00] you the point is like I said we know
[46:02] that Enoch went up but brother R said
[46:05] his soul was in
[46:07] Paradise well he doesn't say that Elijah
[46:10] was there he doesn't say that Moses was
[46:13] there that I can find now I said that I
[46:16] can
[46:17] find well I'm not worried about
[46:20] it I'm saying some things I don't
[46:23] understand I'm not worried about but I'm
[46:24] concerned about what I do
[46:28] understand when brother brandham went
[46:30] beyond a curtain of
[46:32] time he ask about
[46:35] Jesus now these quotes are laying here
[46:38] if you need
[46:39] them he said can I see him he said no
[46:45] said he's a little higher amen you can't
[46:48] go there that's right all
[46:51] right now did the Old Testament Saints
[46:55] go into the the presence of Jesus in
[46:58] that
[46:59] form that he was
[47:02] higher than brother
[47:05] brandom if they did you got a lot of
[47:09] problems then you got problems with the
[47:12] Hebrews
[47:13] 11:40 that they without us cannot be
[47:15] made
[47:17] perfect all
[47:20] right see then you got trouble trying to
[47:23] get it together because you can't say
[47:26] no you can only say I'm saying what was
[47:30] said all right I can
[47:35] say repent every one of you get baptized
[47:37] in the name of father son Holy
[47:42] Ghost is that scripture Matthew 28 come
[47:45] on I can say repent everyone to be
[47:47] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[47:50] right I've quoted both
[47:53] scriptures all right only through this
[47:56] end time Prophet was we able to
[47:59] understand how that those things comes
[48:01] together to make it Lord Jesus
[48:04] Christ because now I'm going to say
[48:07] something that's going to be hard for
[48:07] you to swallow but there's no scripture
[48:11] that says the baptized quote a scripture
[48:14] quote in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:19] Christ he doesn't say that he says in
[48:22] the name of Jesus
[48:24] Christ but then Paul picks it up later
[48:26] in the writings and he said in the name
[48:29] of the Lord right so now to fulfill the
[48:33] Great Commission that's why when I
[48:35] baptize that's what I say to fulfill the
[48:39] commission repent everyone and be
[48:41] baptized in the name of the father and
[48:43] of the son and of the Holy Ghost to
[48:45] fulfill
[48:46] that I baptize you in the name of the
[48:50] Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost
[48:53] Lord Jesus Christ uh we had some people
[48:57] come to church
[48:58] here and it's is the only people I've
[49:00] ever told
[49:01] anything and they said well I was
[49:03] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ do
[49:05] you think that was
[49:06] correct I said the Bible says Jesus
[49:11] Christ and that would be correct as long
[49:14] as your understanding is correct but if
[49:16] you were in a church that baptized under
[49:20] regeneration see some of the churches do
[49:23] Pentecostal churches baptize under re
[49:25] generation in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:27] now listen some of them baptized in the
[49:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ but it's
[49:33] under
[49:34] regeneration just like the Church of
[49:36] Christ the Pentecostals baptize you in
[49:39] the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:42] Christ expect you to come up speaking in
[49:46] tongues all
[49:48] right what are you bringing that out for
[49:50] brother just to
[49:52] show that the prophet brought it Lord
[49:55] Jesus Christ
[49:56] Christ and that's the reason I baptized
[49:58] the way I do cuz I found one day how he
[50:00] said it to fulfill that Great Commission
[50:03] you know all right and those people I
[50:06] told them they said do you think I ought
[50:08] to be baptized again I said I think
[50:10] anybody that would be baptized under
[50:13] regeneration right whether it would be
[50:15] Church of Christ or where it would be
[50:16] Pentecostalism or whatever or to get
[50:18] baptized again
[50:20] amen because you're dealing under
[50:23] regeneration and we don't baptize under
[50:26] regeneration that's not
[50:29] scriptural see that I do know all right
[50:32] you see what I'm talking about there
[50:34] things we do know that has been put
[50:37] together for us in this end time by the
[50:40] end time prophet and that's why we can
[50:43] State the things we State and say I
[50:46] know all right see then if they without
[50:50] us cannot be made
[50:52] perfect all right and I have the quotes
[50:54] where brother brandom I will maybe give
[50:57] it this afternoon but where he even says
[50:59] that know they're waiting on you and I
[51:02] to get lined
[51:04] up that's see for us to get
[51:08] straight right he talking about the Old
[51:10] Testament
[51:11] Saints all right that's right but see
[51:15] that way you're looking at it with the
[51:18] right understanding and just saying we
[51:20] leave some things alone but we do know
[51:22] for sure right all right
[51:27] now as I said I don't believe that they
[51:29] were raised to
[51:31] immortality In the
[51:33] Flesh in the Old Testament
[51:36] science you know that's okay if you want
[51:38] to believe the other way that's fine
[51:39] that's because you know you got a quotes
[51:41] you got but just remember the same
[51:45] Prophet that said they raised in an
[51:47] immortal body are raised in the body
[51:50] they lived in are raised into this that
[51:52] or the other the same prophet said it
[51:56] one
[51:58] day Adam will reach over and get
[52:01] Eve Eve will get able able to get Seth
[52:05] Etc right down to Abraham he
[52:08] said right he said there'll be a
[52:11] resurrection then he comes to the Future
[52:15] home and he says one of these days Those
[52:17] Old Testament
[52:20] Saints he said we raise in the
[52:24] resurrection he said and we'll fall
[52:26] right in line and go right on amen
[52:30] that's right so is he
[52:33] confused no I say we
[52:36] are I say we
[52:39] are all right you can say but I believe
[52:42] it this way well the other person said I
[52:43] believe it this way now what are you
[52:44] going to do you're going to argue with
[52:46] each other until the Doomsday and all
[52:48] you doing is marching around
[52:51] horrib do will not say I don't
[52:54] understand
[52:56] but I do understand one
[52:59] thing they
[53:01] raised and one day we
[53:04] raise I do understand that I know
[53:09] that because I
[53:11] know where they
[53:14] went and then you can decide whether
[53:16] which way they went
[53:19] there so when it says open up the
[53:21] Everlasting Gates that the kingom glory
[53:23] may go in now brother randam gave those
[53:35] quotes and when he did let me see if I
[53:38] can just find one right off where we can
[53:40] move on with
[53:45] it all right got the Old Testament guys
[53:48] we got all of
[53:50] them that he's a little higher okay go
[53:53] over brother Joe to number 12 W
[53:56] of and
[53:58] uh we'll try to make some few statements
[54:01] and then
[54:02] we'll come in a little bit upon the
[54:04] thought and then wait until that's
[54:06] afternoon to conclude some things so
[54:09] look what he says in the message the
[54:10] mighty conqueror said the Old Testament
[54:12] Saints being led by the Lord Jesus the
[54:15] mighty conqueror the Old Testament Saint
[54:17] when they got close to that great
[54:18] Celestial City they said lift up you
[54:22] Everlasting Gates and be you lifted up
[54:25] and let the king of glory go in and they
[54:26] said who is the king of glory the Old
[54:29] Testament Saints Mighty and the see the
[54:32] the Lord of hosts Mighty in battle he
[54:34] led captivity captive he ascended on
[54:37] high and gave gifts to men walked up
[54:39] into the presence of God the father and
[54:42] he said here they are father I have
[54:45] overcome and I've brought them
[54:49] here all right now watch him he said
[54:52] climb upon on this throne and set down
[54:56] at my right hand till I make every enemy
[54:59] your foot
[55:01] stol so now we know for a certainty
[55:04] where they
[55:07] went they went into the presence of God
[55:10] yeah all right but see you can Elevate
[55:13] that away on up but why not leave it
[55:16] where it's
[55:17] at where're in the
[55:20] Bible we're in the Bible is it that he
[55:25] is to climb up on the throne and sit
[55:26] down and we'll cover this this afternoon
[55:28] remember when Jesus the reason he said
[55:30] climb up on the throne and sit down
[55:32] that's the father's
[55:33] strong which would be the baptism of the
[55:36] Holy Ghost down through seven Church
[55:37] ages that's why he said climb up the
[55:39] throne because Jesus said he did
[55:40] overcome shall sit with me in my Throne
[55:43] as I have overcome and sit with the
[55:44] father in his throne now Jesus had to go
[55:47] straight to the father's Throne to show
[55:48] it was finished he climbed upon the
[55:51] father's throne and sat
[55:54] down but one day he'll come forth from
[55:57] there to his own
[55:59] Throne all right see his throne is on
[56:02] Earth
[56:03] Millennium all right but now he's
[56:06] sitting on the throne and where's the
[56:10] body at the right
[56:12] hand
[56:14] right where's the body the body's at the
[56:17] right hand where's the right
[56:19] hand where you going into scripture with
[56:22] it CU you go into scripture with it to
[56:24] where Jesus went that the people went
[56:26] with
[56:27] him all right so now let's just read it
[56:30] turn on Revelation chap
[56:33] 5 let's go to
[56:35] four and then we'll go to
[56:37] Five remember now the key is and there's
[56:41] a lot of quotes to this I'll give them
[56:42] this evening he said climb upon my
[56:44] Throne upon the throne and sit
[56:48] down that was not his throne that was
[56:51] the father's
[56:52] Throne which would make the baptism of
[56:54] the Holy ho ghost to be able to come
[56:56] back so those other Old Testament saints
[56:59] went where he went where did he
[57:02] go where's the next account of him after
[57:06] the
[57:08] resurrection right so we look in
[57:10] Revelations
[57:13] 4 and immediately I was in the spirit
[57:15] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[57:18] now brother brandham defines and
[57:20] explains this and then he explains one
[57:23] sitting on the throne he actually says
[57:25] that John first didn't see one sitting
[57:28] on the throne he saw the
[57:30] throne the domain the kingdom the things
[57:33] he said then he saw one sitting on the
[57:37] throne now remember that's not his
[57:42] throne right because something's got to
[57:45] happen and he that set up was to look
[57:47] upon like Jasper and S and stone and
[57:49] there was a rainbow round about The
[57:51] Throne inside of an like unto an
[57:53] emerald right which is the Lord Jesus
[57:56] Christ sitting on the throne in heaven
[57:59] the body to this day is sitting on the
[58:01] throne in heaven that's why his body is
[58:03] not here on Earth right we know that CU
[58:07] we're his body right see when all of
[58:10] this is finished it'll match up then he
[58:12] can come that's right all right now if
[58:14] you go to souls in prison you'll find
[58:16] brother Brown saying he said that lamb
[58:19] was back in eternity making
[58:22] intercession he said he come around to
[58:24] the one sitting on the throne climbed
[58:27] upon on the throne and said I am and
[58:29] said I'm the one that done it
[58:33] right that he becomes the one on the
[58:36] throne that's right all right now
[58:40] watch and it describes what he looks
[58:42] like but look around the
[58:44] throne and we know where he
[58:48] went he went to the father's
[58:51] Throne right right I said I've got a lot
[58:55] of quotes laying here many more at home
[58:57] but a lot can be read that he went to
[59:00] the father's Throne so where did Jesus
[59:02] go when he
[59:05] resurrected he went to the Father Strong
[59:08] we think he went up to some position
[59:10] somewhere or something on
[59:14] Beyond where's the scripture and where's
[59:17] the prophet CU even the prophet said
[59:19] Jesus is higher but said you can't go
[59:22] there right right
[59:25] all
[59:27] right show me in the message are the
[59:30] scriptures where he went you say into
[59:34] the presence of
[59:36] God I'll be glad to read these quotes to
[59:39] you because that's what he says about
[59:42] him raising and going and going to the
[59:44] father's Throne into the presence of
[59:47] God these things we
[59:49] know all right but look who's there and
[59:52] round about The Throne were four and 20
[59:57] seats and upon the seats I saw four and
[1:00:00] 20 Elders clothed in white
[1:00:05] rment what is that now that's that's
[1:00:08] eternity
[1:00:11] right okay clothed in white rment and
[1:00:15] they had on their heads crowns of gold
[1:00:17] already had them all right now brother
[1:00:20] randam who are those 24
[1:00:23] Elders he said the 12
[1:00:26] apostles and the 12
[1:00:29] Patriarchs you're in chapter
[1:00:32] 4 in chapter 4 you have the 12 apostles
[1:00:36] and the 12 Patriarchs so where did the
[1:00:38] Old Testament Patriarchs go with Jesus
[1:00:42] to the same place he
[1:00:48] went come
[1:00:51] on but it's chapter 4
[1:00:57] a total
[1:01:02] reality or are
[1:01:05] those in a theophonic Eternal
[1:01:08] form going roll up chapter
[1:01:12] 5 in
[1:01:14] luk all
[1:01:16] right and I saw in the right hand of him
[1:01:19] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:01:20] within and on backside seal with Seven
[1:01:23] Seals and a strong angel proclaiming
[1:01:26] with a loud voice who's worthy to open
[1:01:28] the book and loose the seals thereof and
[1:01:32] no man in
[1:01:35] heaven now you can I quote brother
[1:01:37] randam from the seal book he said if I
[1:01:41] get the wording wrong now you put it in
[1:01:43] right he names some of the Old Testament
[1:01:45] Saints see seem like he names Abraham
[1:01:48] seemed like he named Elijah he named
[1:01:50] some of them and he said they were
[1:01:53] th but he said they wouldn't
[1:01:56] worthy right that's right now if they
[1:01:58] were already in glorified soul and the a
[1:02:03] body why wouldn't they have been
[1:02:07] worthy so there's got to be a
[1:02:10] key cuz he said they're not
[1:02:13] worthy if they had reached to Total
[1:02:16] immortality why were they not worthy and
[1:02:19] then they wouldn't be waiting on us we'd
[1:02:21] be dependent upon what they
[1:02:23] done we remember 24
[1:02:27] Elders you remember at that time John
[1:02:30] wasn't there you know what I'm
[1:02:34] saying but the 12
[1:02:37] apostles John was one of the 12
[1:02:40] right but at that time he was seeing all
[1:02:43] of
[1:02:44] this so it had to be a Future
[1:02:48] Part you know or had to be an eternal
[1:02:51] theoy Point go look what it said and I
[1:02:55] saw a strong Angel proclaim a loud voice
[1:02:56] who's worthy to open the book and loose
[1:02:58] the seals thereof and no man in Heaven
[1:03:01] Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:03:03] able to open the book neither to look
[1:03:05] their own and I wept much because no man
[1:03:08] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:03:10] book neither to look their own and one
[1:03:14] of the elders saith unto me we've not
[1:03:17] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:03:20] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:03:22] the book and the ls the seal and I have
[1:03:24] be held and low in the midst of the
[1:03:27] throne where' the lamb come
[1:03:30] from brother brandom says the lamb comes
[1:03:33] from the church ages now if you want the
[1:03:37] quotes cuz that's Father
[1:03:42] Strong now come on if you can't tie this
[1:03:44] together then you're going to miss the
[1:03:45] whole thing who is that lamb and what is
[1:03:49] that somewhere up in
[1:03:52] heaven or was that the son of man that
[1:03:55] was promised to come in this last
[1:03:58] days not brother
[1:04:02] brandom separate that now not brother
[1:04:04] brandom the son of man the Lamb of God
[1:04:07] the Lord Jesus Christ was promised to
[1:04:10] come in this end
[1:04:12] time all except what a Corporal body
[1:04:16] right is that the words of the prophet
[1:04:19] he said he's here in every way except
[1:04:22] the Corporal body right why wouldn't we
[1:04:24] believe in healings and signs and
[1:04:27] wonders and believe Hebrews
[1:04:29] 13:8 and why wouldn't we believe sir
[1:04:33] that God is here with us doing it but I
[1:04:35] just don't see it you remember all them
[1:04:38] messages I just don't see it why are we
[1:04:44] sick right maybe maybe it's never went
[1:04:47] through the dumb part of her head amen
[1:04:52] he can't heal you if you ain't sick
[1:04:59] right do I need to quit right
[1:05:02] there if you ain't sick you don't need a
[1:05:06] Healer if you ain't lost you don't need
[1:05:08] a
[1:05:12] savior so we've got to let it go down to
[1:05:14] the bottom right cuz we're not dealing
[1:05:17] with just healing of the
[1:05:20] flesh that's right chapter 5 is not
[1:05:23] dealing with the human flesh that it's
[1:05:25] dealing with the opening of the
[1:05:29] word the things we do
[1:05:32] know that God didn't leave The Mercy
[1:05:36] Seat in 63 the body is still
[1:05:39] there even till this day when he raises
[1:05:43] to come here Redemption will be over but
[1:05:46] remember we meet him in the
[1:05:52] air what
[1:05:54] do you understand what he's saying he
[1:05:57] came and took the book out of the right
[1:05:58] hand hand that sat upon the throne
[1:06:00] around and says solds in prison look he
[1:06:02] said he climbed up on the throne sat
[1:06:04] down he said he been back in eternity
[1:06:06] make an
[1:06:08] intercession he become the one on the
[1:06:13] throne but who all was still there when
[1:06:15] he was doing this and when he had taken
[1:06:17] the book The Four Beast come back beast
[1:06:21] and four and 20 Elders fell down before
[1:06:24] the lamb having every one of them Harps
[1:06:26] and golden vows full of oders which are
[1:06:29] the prayers of the
[1:06:30] Saints the 24 Elders in chapter
[1:06:36] 5
[1:06:39] right the 24 Elders is the 12 apostles
[1:06:42] and 12
[1:06:45] Patriarchs now I'm going to say it this
[1:06:48] way and you can just think what you want
[1:06:49] to we know for certain that those 12
[1:06:53] Apostles
[1:06:55] do we need to name them 12 Apostles you
[1:06:58] know Peter James
[1:07:00] John those 12
[1:07:03] Apostles are not in glorified
[1:07:06] bodies their body is in the earth that's
[1:07:09] right they've got to come here to get
[1:07:11] their body
[1:07:14] sir why can't you think about the Old
[1:07:17] Testament Saints having to come here to
[1:07:19] get their body
[1:07:21] right right now you're trying to
[1:07:24] interpret it brother Dale no I just lit
[1:07:26] a point
[1:07:27] in let you think about it I've told you
[1:07:30] there's some things I don't
[1:07:33] know I do know the rest of what's there
[1:07:36] it's in the same quote that we just read
[1:07:40] but we won't cover that till this
[1:07:44] afternoon because see here's the thing
[1:07:47] that would be hard to be
[1:07:50] understood if they went to immortality
[1:07:53] back there then why did Paul say death
[1:07:57] is not
[1:07:58] destroyed that's
[1:08:04] right that's all I'm saying on it to we
[1:08:06] get back this evening cuz I was going to
[1:08:08] really I wasn't going to go through this
[1:08:10] I was just going to go on but I seen I
[1:08:11] can't go that way without covering this
[1:08:13] point we're going to talk about death
[1:08:15] being annihilated what is death oh go
[1:08:18] down to Undertaker you I've been on that
[1:08:20] for how many years that ain't death yes
[1:08:24] sir that's right where's the greatest
[1:08:26] battle ever
[1:08:27] fought right
[1:08:29] here where's real death dwelling at what
[1:08:33] is the death that God has come to
[1:08:37] annihilate the carnality of man's
[1:08:43] mind but see if they've already went
[1:08:45] there to eternities and all kind of
[1:08:47] things then they're not waiting on
[1:08:50] us we're dependent on whether or not
[1:08:52] they were accepted
[1:08:56] but I hope you caught the point of what
[1:08:57] I said the 12 Patriarchs the 12
[1:09:01] apostles the 12 apostles are bodies in
[1:09:04] the
[1:09:05] grave and they got to come forth to get
[1:09:07] their
[1:09:09] bodies all
[1:09:12] right you said well what are you
[1:09:16] doing correcting this or that no just
[1:09:20] being
[1:09:22] plain right to where you can think it
[1:09:29] over and to see then they without us
[1:09:31] cannot be made
[1:09:32] perfect I know what was explained by
[1:09:35] Brother away from here and he explained
[1:09:38] that the Old Testament Saints was
[1:09:41] waiting on Jesus to make them
[1:09:43] perfect New Testament Saints was waiting
[1:09:46] on you and I to make us perfect well I
[1:09:48] can't read that in Hebrews 11 because
[1:09:51] everyone I read in Hebrews 11 was Old
[1:09:53] Testament science
[1:10:03] see we want to get a point and then we
[1:10:05] make it and just say we lay on this but
[1:10:07] brother Dale the Old Testament saints
[1:10:09] went right into his presence amen yes
[1:10:13] sir because we just showed where Jesus
[1:10:16] went and if that ain't the presence of
[1:10:18] God you got the father's Throne you got
[1:10:21] the son sitting on the
[1:10:22] throne
[1:10:24] you got the rainbow around about The
[1:10:26] Throne if that ain't the presence of God
[1:10:28] I don't know where you want to go
[1:10:29] to that's right but now here's what I
[1:10:32] love for a second see all of that you
[1:10:35] can argue F and
[1:10:39] bicker but think about
[1:10:46] it right
[1:10:49] here is the Father
[1:10:52] Strong that's right which is the baptism
[1:10:56] of the Holy Ghost in your soul that's
[1:10:59] right yes sir right and right here is
[1:11:03] where the son of man is going to become
[1:11:06] and has come and already the seals has
[1:11:09] been broke the things that happened and
[1:11:11] by that message you and I can become the
[1:11:15] son of
[1:11:16] man we're not trying to take a book or
[1:11:19] trying to do this out of the other
[1:11:21] that's not our
[1:11:22] place
[1:11:24] and even like when brother Brown would
[1:11:25] say he said he climbed up on the throne
[1:11:28] and said down do you
[1:11:30] realize that us being trinitarians in
[1:11:32] the way we was and not understanding the
[1:11:34] truth that Jesus was not on the throne
[1:11:37] of our life I don't care what you say
[1:11:39] right he might have been there as a
[1:11:41] savior right he might have remitted our
[1:11:44] sins and saved us
[1:11:46] right but he was not there as God of our
[1:11:52] life it takes this message to bring him
[1:11:55] to God of Our
[1:11:56] Lives that's right it takes this message
[1:12:00] to bring us to eternal life that's right
[1:12:04] what is the Old Testament waiting on
[1:12:05] what is the the all of the people of the
[1:12:07] world like I said the other
[1:12:10] day everybody going that way and
[1:12:12] everybody was backed that way is waiting
[1:12:15] on you and I that's right you know that
[1:12:18] them 144,000 they're dependent on you
[1:12:21] and I getting out of here and they
[1:12:24] they'll have the message to take to
[1:12:26] Israel but if we don't get out of here
[1:12:28] they won't have no
[1:12:30] message you know the F Ste Jew is
[1:12:32] dependent on you and
[1:12:38] I and what is it that we how that we
[1:12:41] would make them perfect you remember we
[1:12:43] make them
[1:12:45] complete we finished their course for
[1:12:47] them this fell right
[1:12:52] here
[1:12:54] has got to be made
[1:12:57] Eternal then is swallowed
[1:13:00] up that's right right is that what Paul
[1:13:03] said when mortal has put on immortality
[1:13:07] then is brought to light the
[1:13:11] scripture death where you sting grave
[1:13:15] where you Victory
[1:13:21] right waiting on you and I to conquer
[1:13:27] death that's why it's been 40 something
[1:13:29] years folks and we've been fighting and
[1:13:31] cricking and bigger
[1:13:34] yeah but all that time I haven't lost a
[1:13:38] goal because my goal to begin with was
[1:13:41] what 1969 I know people don't like me to
[1:13:44] say that because they say you're exalted
[1:13:46] there's one thing about it I it happened
[1:13:50] right brother dick's been up there that
[1:13:52] iold after what you call it Tower
[1:13:55] whatever you call it that old thing walk
[1:13:56] all the way up in there I ain't never
[1:13:58] been big fortun in you ain't never been
[1:14:02] right well he's been well for him to get
[1:14:06] up and say I've been I like everybody
[1:14:08] throwing off on brother per
[1:14:11] green they threw off on to say he's
[1:14:14] exalted he's been to 140 something
[1:14:16] countries you know what if he's only
[1:14:18] been to 139 he
[1:14:22] lied
[1:14:23] right but if he's been 140 he ain't
[1:14:26] lying and he ain't
[1:14:29] bragging but see we think oh he's just
[1:14:32] brother Dale's trying to
[1:14:34] brag no I'm telling the God's Hest truth
[1:14:37] when I first came in this message when I
[1:14:39] seen what that Prophet said I didn't
[1:14:41] turn to trying to figure out a book of
[1:14:42] rules and thing I turned to see what a
[1:14:46] revelation of Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ the very God of Glory to be
[1:14:52] revealed he to you and
[1:14:55] I and to see him and what he's done you
[1:14:59] think about what we talking about it
[1:15:01] last night you think about what he's
[1:15:02] done for you and
[1:15:04] me he took us you think about David you
[1:15:08] don't never relate like that he said
[1:15:10] David said I took you from a sheep fold
[1:15:13] in other words out there what use that
[1:15:15] word a plain little old bitty guy that
[1:15:18] was nothing all he know how to do was
[1:15:20] play a harp I never did understand that
[1:15:23] out it there with the goats and things
[1:15:24] the Sheep but he could do it and he
[1:15:27] could sing and
[1:15:29] worship taking care of a few sheep God
[1:15:32] said he said I made you
[1:15:35] king that's
[1:15:40] right and he said even in all of your
[1:15:44] doings he said I forgive you
[1:15:49] right you just think about where we come
[1:15:51] from old farmer that was dragging out of
[1:15:54] living PL a mu when I 7 years
[1:16:00] old took us to where at least we've got
[1:16:03] good jobs good homes comfortable places
[1:16:06] to live comfortable Church to set in not
[1:16:09] the best in the world but we could have
[1:16:11] it if we just depend on getting one
[1:16:14] thing and do it but we don't do that do
[1:16:16] we we try to help others a
[1:16:20] little but look what he's done for us
[1:16:24] amen took us out of the garbage cans
[1:16:27] that's right and made us his
[1:16:31] children right sir Hallelujah made us
[1:16:34] his offspring yes sir
[1:16:38] amen and
[1:16:40] saying I'm saving the best the last
[1:16:43] that's right because everything else is
[1:16:45] waiting on you and I that's
[1:16:52] right think on these things but then
[1:16:54] we're going to talk about death being
[1:16:57] destroyed you
[1:17:01] know because if it's not
[1:17:04] destroyed you said it was destroyed in
[1:17:06] Jesus Christ
[1:17:08] amen but show me one person after
[1:17:13] then that's my point show me one person
[1:17:16] after Jesus Christ that death was
[1:17:18] destroyed
[1:17:19] in it took every person since then
[1:17:26] so it's not been applied to us
[1:17:29] yet May Illustrated it there where he
[1:17:31] said the Jews were saved at Calvary you
[1:17:34] remember that you need to just quote
[1:17:36] brother R said those Jews were saved at
[1:17:37] Calvary he said but it's not been
[1:17:41] applied he was eternal but it's not been
[1:17:44] applied to
[1:17:46] nobody but it will be applied in the end
[1:17:49] time let's stand it will be applied to a
[1:17:52] a ride that will be able to stand and
[1:17:58] say I and my father are one
[1:18:02] amen and I
[1:18:05] know I
[1:18:07] know where I
[1:18:09] stand but then I'll tell you some of the
[1:18:12] things I don't
[1:18:14] know I have no problem with saying
[1:18:17] that but a finished Plan of
[1:18:20] Redemption is labeled or dependent upon
[1:18:23] you and I
[1:18:25] right you say yeah but but I just don't
[1:18:28] see nothing going
[1:18:30] on you mean the greatest thing that the
[1:18:34] world has ever thought
[1:18:37] about is going on and you don't see
[1:18:41] nothing going
[1:18:45] on
[1:18:49] right the end of all things has come
[1:18:51] upon us and he's dependent on you and
[1:18:56] I you remember what we brought out
[1:18:59] messages before then he's waiting on you
[1:19:01] and
[1:19:06] I that brings a Plan of Redemption to a
[1:19:09] completed
[1:19:10] form right here in you and
[1:19:13] I now listen to the last statement then
[1:19:16] Jesus went through death burial
[1:19:21] Resurrection and
[1:19:24] Rapture right see nobody's ever done
[1:19:29] that right but this bride in the end
[1:19:32] time is going to have to go because some
[1:19:34] are in the grave some are going to go
[1:19:36] through death burial and then there'll
[1:19:39] be a resurrection and then there'll be a
[1:19:41] Rapture identically
[1:19:44] matching what he done and nowhere is
[1:19:47] there anybody else that matches
[1:19:51] it amen come on the 144,000 don't match
[1:19:55] it that way you feel seal you don't
[1:19:57] match
[1:20:00] it identically matching the Lord Jesus
[1:20:04] Christ is where you and I will come to
[1:20:08] right well I don't know whether it
[1:20:10] nerves or
[1:20:12] unbelief
[1:20:14] right well I believe it's for brother
[1:20:17] Dale oh my now brother brandham said if
[1:20:21] there's one going out of
[1:20:24] Georgia you got to say it's you not
[1:20:27] brother Dale because if you say it's
[1:20:28] brother Dale you better move States then
[1:20:32] right that's right you got to say it's
[1:20:35] you and see then I say it's
[1:20:40] me think about it what do we got number
[1:20:42] 94 94 number 94 anybody have a need
[1:20:49] heard in
[1:20:51] the you have heard fear I'm just talking
[1:20:56] about Jesus
[1:20:58] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:21:06] forever just trying to say I
[1:21:10] know but then things I don't
[1:21:14] know they can be made known when we
[1:21:18] get and you know I'm not worried about
[1:21:21] it us
[1:21:24] the importance is what we are and what
[1:21:27] we're
[1:21:34] doing we're going have to walk right up
[1:21:36] to death look at in the eye
[1:21:41] life
[1:21:50] you sing you will
[1:21:58] glor yesterday you that have had
[1:22:01] migraines you
[1:22:03] know you think about her pray for her
[1:22:08] believe is always well in the name of
[1:22:11] Jesus Christ we send this pray CL for
[1:22:14] all to be finished CU we believe you in
[1:22:18] Jesus is your
[1:22:20] name anybody else
[1:22:27] the refused
[1:22:34] to
[1:22:38] loveon
[1:22:43] be see when we get there we can talk
[1:22:46] about what went on
[1:22:50] here but I remember what I preached to
[1:22:53] you for what 20 years I
[1:22:58] guess if Revelations 5 is a place a
[1:23:05] position we've got a match here on
[1:23:08] Earth exactly what that
[1:23:12] is when Martin Luther reached a place of
[1:23:17] justification glor he left
[1:23:21] the because that was for the
[1:23:24] day and John Wesley seen it and preached
[1:23:28] it and they lived it he went on off when
[1:23:32] you Pentecost sing their
[1:23:35] day had to go on somebody is not going
[1:23:39] to go on we're going to go up why can't
[1:23:43] we believe we're the
[1:23:47] on
[1:23:48] an you say brother there how many people
[1:23:51] do you know believe much you
[1:23:53] believe I ain't never been worried about
[1:23:55] it but I've been one thing and you know
[1:23:56] it I'm always looking for
[1:24:01] somebody that believe what I
[1:24:04] believe you know what when I find them I
[1:24:08] TI on to
[1:24:12] it because that's the way I am I believe
[1:24:16] around the
[1:24:17] world that God is working in a
[1:24:21] bride to bring her to a
[1:24:24] place may just be one or two here one or
[1:24:27] two there but he's still doing it
[1:24:30] somebody to recognize who they
[1:24:33] are and what they're here
[1:24:35] for you realize you're here to conquer
[1:24:39] the devil so that
[1:24:43] everybody prior to
[1:24:45] you can come out of the Grave or come to
[1:24:48] whatever is
[1:24:50] needed so we have a great position
[1:24:54] to be
[1:24:55] reached yeah but if we was a bride we'd
[1:24:58] see more like I said we've seen six or
[1:25:01] so times of dead rais and you can say
[1:25:03] that to people on the internet and they
[1:25:05] ain't a one of the people out there
[1:25:06] going to come and run in here to say but
[1:25:08] if you'd have done that 20 30 years ago
[1:25:11] You' you we' have had to have three
[1:25:12] times a building to put them in we'd
[1:25:14] have been meeting up in Gainsville and
[1:25:16] that great big old 3000 capacity thing
[1:25:18] cuz everybody would have run to it to
[1:25:20] see the Ted's been raised now you can
[1:25:22] say what you want to now you can preach
[1:25:25] the way you want
[1:25:26] to oh that's just anointed
[1:25:32] ones thank
[1:25:34] you at least you say that I'm
[1:25:42] anointed you understand I mean if you
[1:25:45] saying I'm anointed and that happen at
[1:25:47] least you're saying I'm anointed thank
[1:25:49] you what's the matter with you
[1:25:53] oh that's you don't
[1:25:55] like what's your
[1:25:57] problem well I'm just sitting here
[1:25:59] waiting on the lord well all
[1:26:05] right just make sure that you're at the
[1:26:08] train station instead of the bus depot

[1:26:15] we love you and we've tried our best to
[1:26:17] be as plain as we
[1:26:19] could to bring forth what we know
[1:26:24] the things that we see in your word and
[1:26:27] to follow
[1:26:28] thereafter we
[1:26:30] know so now just take that part that we
[1:26:34] know and make it into a
[1:26:37] reality a manifestation into our hearts
[1:26:40] and lives forgive our sins and cleanse
[1:26:43] us and guide us in Jesus name amen your
