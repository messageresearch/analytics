that uh was uh flying his kite you know and there was a kind of low mist and the fell said to him you know well what are you doing he said I'm flying my Kate he said well I don't see any Kate just a string he says you know how do you know he says well I feel the pull I feel I know it's there cuz I feel the pull and and that's that's the way a minister feels somebody comes into a place sister pagy when you feel the pool I felt that for some time that that uh I'm sure not just one or two but but there's a lot of you that has want to hear from God and I just pray as brother Ronald pray prayed that God would take the clay lips and push me out of the way and take full control and and and be a blessing to your heart this morning amen uh so it is a joy to be here and uh praise the Lord uh I was talking to my wife sends over her love to you I was just talking to her this morning morning and of course it's about what half 2 in the afternoon there and I in Ireland half 3 and uh they've they've had their service over this morning the what they do when I'm away now because pastors don't generally like um going to another church of the pastor the resident pastors away so uh what we do now we find it works well we play brother brandham and Brother Joseph Bram actually made us a gift of their the best equipment they've got in D D and that was very nice of him and I thanked him for it and uh he sent us back a lovely letter which we treasure and uh you know so we've got anything we want on the I I did have DVDs but not not any not any quality L to what Joseph s over we got many books so the the I don't know I actually forgot to ask her what they were listening to today but I I know one thing uh it was would have been a wonderful message and they've got the books and they can read it as well so they're well fed praise the Lord and we've come for our spiritual food as well amen so we do bring our love over uh to you God is moving amen little bits and pieces and we're always looking out uh amen for that predestinated seed we always are looking out for that amen praise the Lord and um you know that's when brother Bram said when the last person is in uh you know in the Bible it's actually there if you could see it that the Bible tells us that Lydia the purple of seller she was the first European person to come to Christ and if she was the first one there has to be a last one so that's that's that's that's we understand that don't we and uh so praise the Lord uh the the the churches are doing well and the brothers are doing well and uh when I go home I'll be off for a few weeks then we're going over to Scotland which is lovely uh praise the Lord we' be preaching over there I take my wife with me there and I hope to go up to Iona to where Columbo was he always said I don't know if it's true or not but he said if you visit once you'll visit three times so this would be my third visit to the island so amen praise the Lord and of course uh when we left here last year we did go over to India which we were planning on the Lord willing amen always of the Lord is willing and uh we're planning to go back to India again this November so uh last year we went over and uh you know brother brownon the angel told Brother bham never lose your feeling for the people that's a very very dangerous thing for a minister to lose the feeling for the people and praise the Lord uh we must remember where our offerings came from it came from the people and so when we were in Hyderabad at the end of the service a lovely service and they've got a different way of doing things you know so they all started to bring out flowers to me you know not just the ones you put over your neck but flowers bunches and I was standing there getting heavier and heavier with these so I had to call for a table put the flowers down and people kep that's what they wanted to do so I just say amen and uh what a wonderful service lovely weather there too very it's quite hot in and and even in November and um uh we went up to uh well I'll tell you about this story first when we finished the service brother Samuel uh people were going out the door now the Indian people you got to know the culture you got to know the psychic hard to think and that's why I'm getting fairly well into to Har American people think but I'll tell you what but I'll tell you what the Indian people there must be more healings goes on on the way out of the church than there is actually in the church because they'll stop you at the door and ask you to pray amen they going out would you pray for me you know would you do this you know and you do of course you just do because you know you saw brother Bram doing it uh you know and anyway uh this this sister came up sh hands with her and she says do you recognize me me and I just stood back and I said I sure do stand there with her husband shook hands with him too and you could see her lovely hair beginning to grow out again like this last year he brought her to the church they travel a long way to come to the church she whatever stage of cancer she was doing her last treatment and that was it and she she looked pitiful I'll tell you she really did she what had a scarf completely bald had a scarf her whole skin she just didn't look like a whale girl and uh n here she was the just Health you know the hair growing down again and I said well praise God and thank God you know and I said to that sister I said you know Sister you might think well last year I just prayed a prayer over you got you out of the way and forgot about you I said I did not I said I prayed for you many many times in Ireland amen so she had come down all that way just to give God the glory amen I'm sure other people prayed for her it's got nothing to do with persons but you know I just really thank God uh to see that that girl rejoicing amen praise praise the Lord and God bless her God bless her today amen um you know folks when the Holy Spirit dangles these things in front of you amen you should you should take take note you should take note and uh there was one little woman and she's a good Christian girl a middle-aged woman and uh up in uh Bombay and uh she came out for prayer at the end of the service we were only there a couple of days and uh she had a guer and I never seen anybody with a guer like that you stuck out under their throat and so I have a little prayer cloth I keep it in my wallet and uh praise the Lord uh I said well I'll lay this on you I'll pray for you and then when I was praying I just think of you were praying for them I just try and keep this short but you know just think if you were praying for that sister what would you do you're standing there there's a guy there well are you you going to believe God's going to take it off or is he going to take a year to take it off or what's he going to do so I said well Lord I should really be believing you here you know so anyway we prayed the prayer and I said I should be really believ in you here so I took off the guer and I'm looking really intent and and I don't see nothing there so I turned around to one of the brothers I said would you look at that I said is that gone he said sure is so she was beginning to to to feel it as well about the size of a good egg you know and it was gone amen and don't ask me and don't ask your doctor either because he doesn't know what happened to that guer but I tell you what something touch her I believe it was God you know amen and uh so we we've always the pleasure I don't know how many but the time we get the glory I just hope that every person we baptized uh gets in mix it in somewhere along the line you know but we we certain are always baptizing people there and it's got less and less you know over the years but you might baptize five or six or seven whatever just whatever the needs are you baptize them there and we had a we had a day off a day off in the life of a pastor whatever and uh so we were going to go just near we in this place nazur it's near the ocean and I love to go up and so we walk along this massive miles and miles of Beach and uh what happened was before we went the motorbike that I was on turned right and I thought uhoh that's not the way to the beach you know and you R away but I'll tell you just watch what God did on the way to the beach amen and the first house we stopped that this sister came out to meet us and her husband and the little child I don't know if it was a boy or a girl to tell you the truth right now and it was wild hot in a fever crying and kicking as hard as it could and she was embarrassed because she could hardly keep it in her arms and I said that that's okay you know so I got ruined a little fell and got my hands on it and it was kicking and shoving and crying and just as we prayed just like that just bit by bit but B and you know you I'll tell you this is the truth you know this is my last message you know I had to face god with this this is the truth and I just felt that fever go down sister Peggy go down and go down and that little fella there is land on his mother's arms I said you can take that baby home now it's okay you know when done went down about four went down about four went down about four four houses this is this is the day off and they took me into this house and there was a kind of a like a a little wooden bed and there and a pillow there's a woman in the bed she's covered with her blanket and all that but my she's she's murmuring to herself and her legs are flying about you know and she's not comfortable and I said well what happened to her and they said well it's something to do with her heart and they said they've told her they can do nothing for her and and I said well I'm sorry to hear that she been in her 50s maybe and um her name was Mary and uh praise the Lord said will you pray for her and I said yeah that's that's all we can do and that's all we will do and dear folks I tell you what it's it's just a simple prayer right that's it it's just a simple prayer but if that prayer touches God if you make contact amen I tell you if you have the prayer of faith then you will bring a reaction from God now you're sitting in your seat this morning if you do that contact him and release your faith I'll tell you what it will bring a reaction he'll never react not react to Faith like the little woman that touched His Garment he'll never he'll always do it and uh you know so we left we went to another brother but at least we got a cup of coffee but any any one of them if we'd asked for tea or coffee we would have got it but we went to another little brother and uh he's doing well too last year they'd give him nearly up but he's doing well had a bit of Fellowship there and then we eventually went down to the seashore and the fishermen were there a big Mount of fish just spread out you know so you take whatever you're going to take and buy it and take it home we had a nice nice meal out of that and uh it was it was really nice praise the Lord but uh that evening the little little guy came around on his sco motorbike and he jumped out he's all excited and he run up and he says M's up M's up you know and M talking Mar's talking you know and uh I said well praise God for that you know and uh not only that but uh so the doctor they phoned up the doctor he says bring her right up and he examined her he said I've got I can't explain it he said I don't know what's happened to her he said can't explain it so praise the Lord just just so wonderful you know and uh not only that there but you know uh when when we were leaving uh they were telling me that she was up and she was singing Christian songs so God bless her and you know I tell you one thing see what it does in India is it creates an atmosphere in that Village so once people here can it's a stepping stone it's a stepping stone to bring the word amen as well you know and of course in India we always help them with uh some of the poer people there is some poor people some of them are some of the the churches now give us offerings brother uh brother Samuel and it's wonderful just to help us on our way and uh uh but yet there is some of Po ones and we still buy them the rice buy them their Dow and their oil and whatever we can do uh to help them we we do it amen help the poor help the poor pastors to to give them a gift and I tell you what I just heard this morning that you'll help them uh them people somewhere in Africa or Filipino wherever it is just to to to get the gospel out amen wonderful and the little children actually give me a love offering in India it was it was very very lovely but anyway let me go down just and finish off here uh in March this year amen uh we went back to Thailand and uh you know the devil's real and the devil's real and God is real amen God is real but uh when I get over to Thailand uh I I couldn't get into my email and I I don't know why I couldn't get in because I was answering all the questions you know the typing the question and all this graffiti kind of thing and I couldn't get into it and I didn't get into it so I couldn't email the people that I was going to I couldn't email home and uh uh not only that there but I looked up my my ticket and I had the wrong part of the what you print off I didn't have the E uh a ticket part and I thought oh this is good so if I go up to the airport I give them my passport and if that doesn't show up you know well where's your ticket I don't have it so it was a real fight I'll tell you it was a real fight the the song leader he had to go into the hospital to get the Sten in and it was a real battle oh boy it sure was but you know something folks sometimes God lets that happen to see what you're going to do amen and I'll tell you what I did uh on the Wednesday night uh I got on my knees and the Lord spoke to me about Abraham and he said that Abraham did not even consider the deadness of his own body now that's awesome stuff he didn't even consider I cannot do it but God said I will do it and he did do it Hal alah and so that's what I believed and I came home and I preached a message on it so I I wrote it in my notes before it was even done that I am not considering what my eyes and what my senses are telling me but I'm considering that God sent me here and that we will overcome and that everything will work out right and from the next morning everything just started to come into place and it was wonderful how that happened so I can remember that very very very well amen and uh we had a wonderful time there we always help the little church and they are poor and uh uh you know so we get them rice and things like that and we baptize two precious people and uh I don't know if it was translated or not but when I baptized them and they were standing there in the water and I said it was a man and a woman and I said to them are you happy and they said very happy and they you could see it in their faces you know you could see it in their faces and and that's right so I thank God for these things amen uh wonderful uh and then we flew down to Indonesia uh to midan and somatra I'd never been there before but you know I can I can tell you just the same way as John was our representative and he came back and told us about that New Jerusalem he come back and told us what he saw how the L took the book he was our representative he was there so I was in Indonesia and I can tell you as your representative what it's like amen and the bride is the bride Hallelujah and never been there in my life and just fit it right in Hallelujah wonderful Pastor doing a wonderful work and we met about five or six pastors I believe it was and we had a wonderful time in Indonesia praise the lord we traveled on their their Jets we traveled on their uh uh Railway system and we traveled overnight as well and there's 240 million Muslim people there well not all Muslim but the main reason why there's no trouble is cuz I don't know how many millions of them don't practice nothing they just name only so as many people that got as you well know in America as well in Ireland name only Catholics name only you know yeah name only so that means that there was no persecution on the Christians and I'm glad about that you know and that's where the tsunami head over if you remember Sumatra there five mli islands in Indonesia and down in Jakarta the main Pastor there we didn't get down that far but he was just on the phone and he was just D for us to come down so maybe uh again we might get down to Jakarta amen but wonderful time and there was a little Pastor there he was standing crying at the pulit and he said you might think I'm crying because I'm sad he said no I'm crying because I'm happy amen crying with tears of joy Hallelujah because God had come down and touched him and the word just touched him and he was so blessed his little wife um she was having a little bit of trouble but uh when we left he was on the phone to her and she she told him she couldn't walk from A to B I don't know the distance because I never inquired but wherever it was it may have been across the street it may be a mile I don't know but I don't think it was very far and she couldn't walked it without stopping Midway and and and she said to her husband she said I went over and I came back and then I realized you never stopped you didn't have to stop amen so I thank God it's real and it is real folks amen at Israel um praise the Lord wonderful to really uh to encourage them amen but uh we we drove you know on the mission field you have to be ready for anything you could get up at 4:00 5:00 you know travel all night we traveled all night in the van and uh thank God I wasn't driving amen and the next morning we started at half half 7 and halfast 6 we pulled into the the new church where we were going to and so we were able to have some breakfast uh and we were able to get washed up and and and I lay down for oh maybe an hour I forgot that and then I got a shake and said it's service time amen and I said okay so you can imagine it's fairly tiring you know but I want to tell you a little story here so uh we we we uh they were singing all as well and they weren't singing it right and I I corrected that I was telling brother lenel Rons that now in Indonesia they can sing all as well the way you wrote it amen so that was good and uh praise the Lord they love that and uh just at the end of that service brother Arin I went down and I sat down in my chair I got there and I'm not joking you something started to swirl around me and I looked up and I just could see these angels there's about two or three of them brother weird and there they were that lovely olive skin black ha and the white no wings no nothing like that just like that and they didn't even touch me but they were kind of swirling around me and just the energy just came out like that there wow and I tell you I it man I said Thank You Lord hallelujah and boy I could have get up and run the 100 yard race and that's real and I thank God that he cares enough about us to do that amen so it was wonderful and uh we we at that in the afternoon I was trying to get another little rest before the evening service and they came and said uh one sister wants to be baptized so we went down to the river and I I like that old southern song you know oh brother let's go down and I'd be singing it to them let's go down to the river and pray amen you know that one brother Nick amen oh brother let's go down let's go down to the river and pray Lord and uh and we get into the river very fast flowing but we were this quiet spot and so we we take took the service and the brother said the Pastor he said now you'll have to get out quickly I says why what's what's a hurry you know got Hur got the brother brother the we translator and I'm getting out he said there's crocodiles in that River and I I said never I said there ain't no crocodiles in that fast flu in River he said brother that's out there he said it's not fast flowing where you're standing so I said if you say so amen praise the Lord uh we went to a we went to a service as well and we took part in a wedding and I knew that was going to happen and brother uh petus and sister Susie got married and wonderful just like any wedding anywhere in the world Amen and he was nervous and he's in his best clothes and it was a wonderful occasion and when they were taking the photographs I may I should really take this time but you know uh when when we were in the taking the photographs I never had as many photographs taken in my life as I did in Indonesia every time I turned around there was somebody taking a photograph they wanted in you know so I learn Indonesian to say no photographs you know and there'd be a big line on them i' be saying no photographs you know and they all be like this and I said okay okay you know but there must be thousands of them down h literally hundreds if not thousands everybody wanted to take a photograph and uh so they were taking photograph of the bride and groom you know and you're standing with their family and you're standing there in your place and all the rest of it and they brought this little sister in and she kind of had a like a white cloth over her her legs and you could see the blood had Saed through from the cloth and uh and uh so the the the the the the bre had held her up and she got her photograph and she was coming back and and he more or less was coming by me and he stopped and I was just waiting to see and he stopped and I prayed for that sister she was crying with pain crying with pain and they explained it I'm not sure what it what it was but uh so he carried her on out and when we had our lunch and all that you can well imagine then it was time to go uh the pastor went into this kind of little place and he was shaking hands with some people and I went in behind him and there she was sitting on the bed smiling just rejoicing and God had just touched her and I I don't know if he'd heal or not but I tell you I'm glad I I I I'm glad about that folks uh prayer is real it it is real amen it's real and I love to to see God doing those things uh I suppose I could tell you more but we went on from there up to uh to Thailand again flew out you stop in quala and and uh then you go up to Bangkok and I got the bus I've got a few photographs at the back I'm sorry if I didn't take any of the congregations but they're in my little uh what do you call it the the wi the we pin thing there so but I got them few I just got them printed and uh you'll see the bus that we went on overnight to go right up to the north of of Thailand and right there the M tribe is my sister-in-law asked me years ago is there anybody there I said I don't know one one soul but you know this year there's a pastor amen and he's coming into this word and who can run better to his own people than he can so thank God for these things and it's wonderful amen we went right into Laos and they are just like Vietnam they're a military State and uh but uh they don't want you to practice Christianity they certainly wouldn't agree with a with an outsider like me preaching but I got the opportunity to speak to the people people are down by the Riverside amen and uh and it was a wonderful service and just like yourselves just attempt to the word believe in the word and my I tell you what I know God's got a bride and Leos so we had a wonderful time and I was telling brother earing about the little girl Esther I believe her name is and she has to get blood every I think she' to get it every three months or something when I was there the first time but now he said you know God touched her she doesn't need half of that and we prayed for for her again and she's a lovely little girl she doesn't look too for an 8-year-old she doesn't look like she's it but you know wonderful and I trust God bless blesses eser today Amen brother uh boomy is his name bumy KO but he you know he's I'll tell you who he's like he's like Fred Flintstone amen so if you can remember Fred Flintstone that's what he's like amen you know and uh but he's a good man and uh he said to me he said yeah I remember he said I remember he said last year you say he said not titles not titles so we B TI now in the name I said that's right I said but make sure it's the full name amen the full title you know the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so um they are having a little bit of persecution from the denominations now because that's a break you know but certainly I would rather drink Branch water and and eat hard bread and have the truth than than stay a big organization and have it all all made no sir I wouldn't want that amen so we had a good time there and I really enjoyed it and that was wonderful to to see there was four tribal pastors there uh when we had that service and it was wonderful and it was really enjoyable so that's what we did that's what we did there last year so may it may it bless you to hear that little testimony amen and of course what what you give last year amen uh we took it over and we used it and that's that's part of your offerings all went into that there so God bless you amen I didn't come here looking to for that because I'll Tell You Folks I don't even concern myself about them things anymore all I know is that when I'm going whatever God wants me to have that's what I'll have wherever it comes from it don't matter it's it's he's the supplier he's Jehovah Jara and he has never failed never failed so I'm thankful for my health uh Indonesia food I never ate Western food for for over a week all Indonesian food and I'm glad I enjoyed it it was lovely amen but I was glad to get a little bit of bread and cheese in one place so that was good you know after the week but amen so it was wonderful so God bless you and thank you for your prayers anytime you pray for me I appreciate your prayers amen because God does hear and answer prayer amen well praise the Lord let's go it's just 11 and we we we'll turn to the the precious word of God this morning it's found in Deuteronomy amen and we will read it this morning uh amen and Deuteronomy of course as you're just turning to it it's the uh the repeat of the law the Second Law if you want but it's the repeat of the law uh he's just reiterating the law to the people amen I'm we going to read uh maybe uh about eight verses we can think stop stop there amen and it says um uh chapter 8 verse1 yes of jeromy it's up there for you all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldst keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know and and this is the message this is the title of the message today that he might make they know that uh let me see that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord does mine live that's right thy remant wax not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years Thou shalt also consider an nine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee therefore Thou shalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of the valleys and Hills a land of Wheat and barley Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of of olive oil and honey Amen Let us just bow for a moment of prayer gracious heavenly father that just Thrills my heart this morning to read that Lord that you have done all these things for us and Lord we come this morning to the god that wants us to live by your every word and we pray father that you will grant that to every one of us that we'll live by every word of God as you reveal it to us so Lord let M decrease let our lord Jesus increase this morning that none be seen save Jesus Christ only we ask it in Jesus name amen praise the Lord amen they tell me amen I'm not sure but I think they they tell me that uh illustrations are uh remembered better than what people preach amen and uh I I I want to prove that to to see if that's true or not so maybe brother deck when I come back next year I might ask you uh what you remember did you remember the message the title or did you remember the little illustration I read one there and I think sister Regina mentioned something about it last night about uh about Jesus but this one was a a woman and she was uh canning the beans and she had a little boy I don't know what age he was maybe nine or whatever not and anyway so she asked him would he go down into the cupboard and and and get her something and bring it out like some some beans or something that she could check the dates or whatever she asked them to go down he said but mom he said it's dark in there and she said I know I know she said but it's okay she Jesus is in there and uh he says okay you know and she don't you worry you'll be safe you know I see a little boy down here you know brother Joe's boy you know uh you'll be safe Jesus is there so the little boy reluctantly kind of went down into and opened the door and the mom came behind him to find out if uh what he was going to do so he' be okay uh and he opened the door and he pushed it open and he said Jesus I know you're in there mom said would you hand me out a can of beans so so we we we we we'll we'll see we'll see amen what you remember most praise the Lord amen you know I think it was brother Henry green said it many years ago all that God ever required and maybe brother Bram said it but I'm not sure but all that God ever required of a man was that he believed his word that he believed God's word that's all God ever required so when you come boil it all down it comes down to that amen and that's a wonderful uh uh text this morning amen all the Commandments of the Lord and that's what it's entitled this morning believing every word of God Amen and uh praise the Lord all the Commandments which I command thee uh this day shall You observe to do observe to do it means to look at it and take notice of it with the the distinct thought of obedience amen that's what his Commandments are for if we don't obey them what use are they praise the Lord so uh amen that you may live so there's life in obeying What God Says in his Commandments amen and to multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear to your fathers you know we know that we're not God's not going to give me when I go home 50 more Acres of Irish land because uh you know no it's not that this is the land of the holy spirit amen the land where you're living tonight spiritually amen that you may go in and possess all the promises of God this is what he wants you to do amen the land of promise amen and uh it's I'm going to speak a little bit on a moment but just to go down this and thou shalt remember it's a good thing to remember uh all the things that that God so I'm going to highlight that in a moment for you but all the things that God did for you I I look at the things God did for me amen praise the Lord keep me safe in Vietnam and you know you look back in these things you see the hand of God brother Terrence I tell you it blesses your heart it means that you know that if he was with you then and he's with you now he'll be with you the next step you take amen and it's wonderful and it says here Amen to Humble thee and to prove thee and to know what's in your heart you know God I'm going to speak about that a little bit later God wants to know what's in your heart amen he wants to know where you stand amen and uh so that's a good thing and we'll think about that later in a moment and uh and he did humble thee and he caused you to hunger and he fed you Mana praise the Lord that was God's provision amen there it's in your Bible Hallelujah we say oh we believe every word and we believe every word amen and there was the Mana we'll talk about that in a little while as well amen and it says that that he might make thee know right that he might make thee know right you see I I love that I was listening to yesterday uh the the cockman 25 years and they they put together 64 their songs so in one of them songs uh Caroline sings uh about going to the little old church in the corner uh where the preacher preach that morning you got to know that you know that you know that's how real it is and I just put that down when it comes to that he might make thee know that man shall not live by bread only we're so thankful for the bread that we live by every day we give thanks for it amen and uh but this is the spiritual bread amen and that that that when you know that you know that you know that you can't live just by Bread only you need something more in life Hallelujah and that is hearing the word of God that you live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord do M live amen so praise God you know uh doesn't it say in one Peter it says that the word of God uh which liveth and abideth forever that's how we live amen and that's what Peter is talking to us about amen so this is really soul food amen praise the Lord that we're talking about today amen sister Jun amen now praise God God and and and uh uh you know not only that there but there's at least two scriptures there that are taken out and carried into your New Testament and repeat it again for you and and one of the ones that one I'll just stay on it for a second because that's the law of the first mansion that's the first time that that ever was put in the word of God and you know I was thinking about it last night brother Samuel that Moses if I said to you where did Moses get the five books from he he had to be in the wilderness cuz he never went into the present Promised Land he never got them there in Egypt so he had to get them in the wilderness how he got them where he went to get them I don't know but I tell you what that's where he got them he got them in the wilderness of siai and he wrote them books and the first time he wrote this inspired book Hallelujah that he put them words in there that's the first time God mentions it like that so therefore it will follow the whole way through the Bible the law of the second mention of the same thing is exactly like the law of the mentioned and the third time it's mentioned it'll contain exactly the same truth and so that's exactly what our lord Jesus as you well know quot it to Satan amen so that's the law of the first mention and the truth will never change amen and then it says here if I can just pull this out very quickly and pass on it said uh about your heart well I'm going to speak about that in a while but as a man Chast his son so the Lord chasteneth thee amen and uh praise the Lord we know Paul picked that out and took it right up into the book of Hebrews and he said in chapter 12 my son despise not the chasings of the Lord amen sometimes you got to correct your child love is corrective sometimes you got to do that amen and do it in love and and he says here so despise not when God is is chastening you and making you right uh and and he says um uh nor uh let me see uh faint when thou art rebuked of him so we don't want to uh be fainting and say oh Lord what are you what are you letting all this happen on me for there's always a higher motive a higher Purpose with God God's Not Like Us folks we were talking about it in the car you know God's higher Hallelujah his ways are higher he's he's he's he's not finite like we are he's infinite amen you know it's very hard to explain God I'm so glad that when Jesus came I see a human being there that in him all the fullness of the God had dwelt that I can explain but where God came from I can't explain Hallelujah he's Eternal didn't have a beginning that won't have an end so it's wonderful and he said don't F so things are tough for you don't F hallelujah amen and uh praise the Lord why because the whom the Lord loveth if he didn't love you he just let you live any old way but he does love you that's why he sent the prophet of day to give us the things that we have to live by them amen and praise the Lord amen and uh uh he he he scourgeth any son that he receives so that is he cleanses us up and he fills us with his own holy spirit amen and uh we we thank God for that there amen now bless the Lord and when Moses here is reciting he talks about this great land which we will talk about in a in a moment that you would walk in the ways of the Lord and rever him and I thank God we're here this morning because we love him and rever him amen we don't fear him like a fear like that but we rever him hallelujah our all and all amen thanking the Lord for all he's done for us and he says uh that you will remember how God was with you you know brother Samuel wrote the book Hallelujah of his life and showed you the times where God was with him amen you yourself if you sat done and thought of the times that God's been with you Amen brother Aaron give me a testimony this morning how God was with him and did what he did for him hallelujah it's wonderful amen and he says remember those things you know uh one thing God does not like and it's ungratefulness Amen cuz God is generous and you know something I don't know what the world's attitude to American people would be but I'll tell you one thing the American people are the most generous people that's on the go face of God's the most generous people amen and I'll tell you what praise God that here we are to remember the Lord amen and to remember all he's done for us and God wants you know them 10 lepers only one come back and said thank you only one God wants us at least to realize where it came from Hallelujah where it came from Amen to remember all his ways and you know the Bible says that God remembered Noah didn't he remember Noah absolutely and when you are need Lord he is there and he will remember you you know and of course I just I want to go on from this here very quickly but you know we remember the I don't know if we'd have communion today or not I don't know what what day it would be but I say this to you it's wonderful to remember the Lord to remember the Lord and we love that service we had one just before we came away the uh communion and fot washing and and and that's that's that's our covenant relationship with God Amen like circumcision was to them that is ours oh my I love that that sweet Holy Spirit coming down to remember Jesus walked all the way up calvary's hell amen praise the Lord that's that's the wonderful thing amen and Paul the Apostle could say that he wouldn't glorify nothing but saving the cross he said I I glorify that that Jesus Christ died on Amen so it's wonderful to remember the Lord and I thank God uh I could keep you here for another hour and tell you about all the ways that the Lord's helped us amen it's been it's been marvelous and and wonderful and all the way my savior leads me what have I to ask beside trusting him who through life's journey has always been my guide amen that's him fonny crossby wrote that and uh praise the Lord I might just pull a few things out this afternoon uh Amen to finish up today but you know all the way through this joury he has been my guide do you realize that this today that he's your guide not just my guide son he's your guide Hallelujah if you will trust him to guide you he'll be your guide amen and uh and the sister your mom beside you and you know it's wonderful to have a guide and uh the scripture says a lot about that you know uh I was just thinking when I was making up this this message that uh a little illustration you know if you went over to the Himalayas and you wanted to climb up one of them high mountains and and you met this little man standing there and he got all his little gear on and his rope and his Peck and all and he's you know and he said I'll take you up you know he said all right and you're looking around for one of them old sherpers you know and you meet one and you say have you ever been up that mountain many times would you take me up that mountain sure will well which one would you go up with right I mean ask yourself you know the fella how many times have you claimed that oh this is my first time but I'll take you up I don't think you would go with them I don't really I don't you know notless you're crazy you know I was coming down the highway yesterday and I know like I mean you know I don't claim any big things brother Samuel but I know that the third lane is the fast lane and that 60 M an hour in the third lane is not exactly the speed limit to go but this this fell that was driving he didn't know that you know but I was over in the the other one and the inside one anyway but you know so people had to go into the middle in and pass them out and you know yeah you know what I'm talking about my guide H you know Jeremiah I love Jeremiah my father thou W my guide it's wonderful that that God is our guide this morning you know and and may I say this uh because uh we were watching a a video on Jeremiah and you could see the whole the whole town of Jerusalem or city burning down and the Temple's been uh burnt and and he's standing there and he raises his hands up to God and he says great is thy fearfulness right great is thy th fearfulness he says to God new every morning is thy love so I tell you what you think about that one amen and here he was Isaiah and the Lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought well we know we're in a Dr folks we're in a famine no I don't know about any famine a fine for hearing the word of God there's where we are but are we famished absolutely not why cuz we've got spiritual food and Juice season amen we've got the word it's a living word as we read from Peter and I'll tell you what it's wonderful and just like the little Widow there in ziden and she was getting her little stick and her little bit of bread and and water all she had to make two cakes for her and her son and she noticed the shadow of a man at the gate amen and he said bring me a drink amen so Hallelujah that God has delivered a drink to his people in this hour amen we're not in a Dr hallelujah we're not if you're in a Dr this morning spiritually see him on you see him on you Hallelujah because the water's there the food's there Hallelujah he said the oil will not diminish the the the meal will not diminish Christ and the Holy Ghost together makes a wonderful kick absolutely so it's wonderful amen and uh praise the Lord also he talked here about uh amen a well a well watered Garden what a lovely thought you know I know Samuel's had a bit of trouble with his garden with all of water this year and we know all about that but we're the opposite we've got a my wife's got a lovely real good garden now you know ready picking in the peas and she's been doing all the boiling and whatever you call them blanching or whatever they call it and uh I know very little about those things and uh but I'll eat the peace I can tell you that and wonderful a wellwater garden when you look at one you see it's healthy it's well praise the Lord a brother came over to us and he preached the message you know uh and it's terrible you know you look at the denominations today from the Catholic Church time and they've got a name that they live but the Bible says they're dead imagine if you had a name you're a dead man you're walking around you know you've got a name that you live but you're dead what a thing to say and it's true Hallelujah and so uh what a difference being a wellwater garden amen and uh praise the Lord for that so amen praise God and all the lovely flowers the lily of the Valley's in your garden amen the Roses Sharon's in your garden amen uh common he he made himself common that we all could reach out and touch him he not there like an orchid there's some orchids you know and and and and bonsai trees that you might have to climb way up into kill yourself may be getting one down but not the Roses Sharon it's common it's there every day that's what he is to me thou art the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys amen and that's what he is to us and we are a well water Garden amen we got all the the fruits I love that in brother Samuel's home and he's got the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness what a lovely thing amen goodness meekness Temperance faith and against such there is no law amen hallelujah praise the Lord and a spring welling up amen Jesus said that he said out of your innermost being would flow rivers of Living Water amen it's wonderful praise God and then of course we know that's the holy spirit in Psalm 32 he said I will instruct Thee I will teach thee in the way that thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye thank God there's an unseen hand there's something just watching us every day and we were talking about it in coming across but you know something absolutely folks we have moral Free Will as Christians there's no you you won't give me one scripture where God will force me to do anything he will not force you to pray he will not force you to read your Bible Hallelujah he'll not do it you're a free moral agent if you want to do it he'll bless you Hallelujah if you want more and get closer to God read it more pray more he'll do it but he'll not force you to do it you're free to do it you're free not to do it and to me that's the Royal law of Liberty you know H maybe not so much over here but I've had people saying to me uh uh brother we don't e eat bacon we don't eat H you know I said that's fine don't eat har as matter of fact it would be wrong for you to eat harm if you think that way about that right I said but you see did you ever hear about the Royal law of Liberty you know what the Royal law of Liberty means I am free I am a free moral Legion Paul said all Meats I can eat whatever I want Hallelujah as long as I give thanks and give the maker who made it and I can eat bacon so there's a wonderful thing where else in this where else in the world will you get a law like that that our lord Jesus give us amen where you're free to do it and you're equally free not to do it I'll tell you you work out you work that one night you go home and think of it I to you amen amen hallelujah okay amen praise the Lord you know it talked about their shoes not um the you know the the clothes they wore didn't wear the shoes didn't wear and you know just to think about that today well well well you know this this Church's getting old amen I'm going to have to replace it and uh praise the Lord but that's not what he's talking about for us the clothes that we're wearing folks is that he's clothed Us in his own righteousness the white linen is the righteousness of the Saints and brother that is never born Hallelujah that's never spoiled all the years we've walked with God that righteousness is the same this morning Hallelujah and is so wonderful amen I might just run around here brother s you know before I get over Hallelujah and and the and the shoes amen what does it say in the book of uh you read this morning didn't you uh brother kie read there about the Ephesians and it says and above all he's talking about the the armor he says he said above all uh on your your feet Shaw with the preparation of the Gospel of of peace brother that will never fail that will never fail amen and it's wonderful to think about peace your feet shwed with the gospel of peace amen you know uh God wants uh to guide you into peace that's his desire Hallelujah I would trust that you would all have peace this morning but I I met a young man that didn't have that peace amen and and I I trust that God touched him that that peace would come but God wants to do that as Zachariah prayed that prayer at the birth of John the Baptist he said and it to give light unto them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death and to guide our feet in the way of Peace Hallelujah you see the devil doesn't know anything about peace but we as Sins Of God Amen when I was in India last year uh the brother he got some thyroid uh trouble or whatever not so he finally goes to this occup rist now I thought they used to stick needles in here but I don't think it's I'm not sure but this guy had wooden wooden needles so I'm sitting watching all this here and and uh uh when he finished he said would you like to have a go and I said well okay so he took my hand he start this big long thing and he pushed it in here and he's pushing in right you know that's okay he comes here and he's starting to push it in that was okay so he got my thumb and he's nearly had it bent right off me you know and he's pushing in and he said that's okay and he said to me do you know he said your body's at perfect peace with itself I said yes sir that's exactly right that's what he said brother dick I'll tell you what and you know and so I said that's okay that's no evidence to me you know because he said that but he said to me something he said but there is a little thing he said you see your left knee and I said yes sir he said you got a little trouble there I said yes I do he said but that's nothing to worry about and he stay right CU as long as I keep exercising that you know when I go and do my exercises you know I've got no trouble with that KN amen so there must be a little bit something to it cuz he touch that point you know so God wants to guide he's the author of Peace amen and he certainly wants to guide us in peace and he has not give us the spirit of fear this morning we don't need the fear you know you know I've got a whole message coming up to my church about fear the Fear Factor amen and I'll tell you what folks tonight we don't need fear you don't need to fear about nothing amen you don't need the fear when you go out you don't need to fear when you come back Hallelujah you go by faith every morning you live Lord Jesus I'm going by faith today faith that you are with me FEI that you will look after me Fe that no matter what happens you'll be right there with me that's it Hallelujah wonderful praise the Lord amen see I'm glad about that there amen and said Mark the perfect mind amen watch your pastor watch put away it watch these brothers and see if their ways are not ways of peace that's right so it's so true you know and I love that song when peace like a river you know we've all sat there beside the river and so peaceful you know so that's what God wants your peace to be like this morning amen but you say oh brother sometimes the old sea belows roll that's exactly right too but there's times with peace like a river there if your life is all storm there's something wrong that's right I mean God wants you to walk and ordain peace for his people amen and of course uh amen uh let the God of Peace in your heart says Paul and and and numbers I love it where he says uh amen that the Lord lift up the light of his countenance and give you peace that would be our prayer this morning and of course what Jesus himself said my peace H there's no peace like got peace folks the peace that he has the peace that he is and he said I give unto you what a gift amen what a gift Hallelujah accept that peace this morning Amen in the name of the Lord and he shall guide us onto death amen our guide will see us through life's journey amen well could I just move on Fast here because time will fly on uh you know he talked about humility to humbly in uh uh there in in in in Deuteronomy and uh and the leadership in the wilderness and why would he want to Humble Israel why would he want to Humble you amen and we'll get the answer in Proverbs where it says because Pride goeth Before Destruction God does not Pride that is what was found in in Lucifer amen the day that Pride was found in thee amen and God hits it and he resists The Pride so he does he does not like it amen and when a person thinks they can do it amen and I'm not saying it was pride and brother Bram but when he got lost up in them mountains up there in the hurrian mountains whereever it was in New York state and the snowed and he was well I'm I'm I'm a woods man I've been through the woods I know how to get out don't worry and he kept going and going and then he came to a point where he said this looks familiar and it was because he was doing the death Circle I tell you he was doing the death Circle and you know something then when he said to the Lord Lord amen please help me I'm lost that's what God wanted to hear him say Amen okay he's a wise guy you think you know I'm not say like that in a wrong sense but you know you think you got the answer you think you know all the answers okay talk yourself out of that one and when he said Lord I can't that's what God wants to hear us you know don't be ashamed of that you can't do it you know you've got someone beside you who can do it he just wants to be called on the scene to help you out to do it wonderful isn't it Hallelujah I tell you what yes and so uh you know a Hoy Spirit goes before a fall and and it's that's in Proverbs 16: 19 it says this better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly amen you know something folks it doesn't matter to me amen I can sleep in a lowly place going into a lonly Little House Hallelujah maybe just a dirt floor it don't matter to me because it's what's in them people's hearts that's all important amen and and I thank God for it and I'd rather be with them than to sit up in some big gambling casino you know what I mean having a million dollars to gamble away tonight I lost it all so what I've got millions yeah no sir I'd rather be with the humble with you today hallelujah praise God then to divide the spoil with the pride amen well could I just give you illustration on that amen and again brother Samuel we were talking about this he me he actually mentioned uh Manasseh today so he did and Hezekiah that Hezekiah prayed when when when when Isaiah said you know I set your house in order you're going to die and he did and he spread that letter before the Lord and God granted him 15 more years amen and that's a wonderful story praise the Lord and you can work it out you know whatever way you want but but I'll tell you what if he had have died at that time there would have been no Manasseh and Manasseh was one if not the most evil guy he was one of them of the Kings of Israel a Judah and so cuz he was only 12 when he began to reain so he was born in the time that God extended to to to to Hezekiah and uh but God knows what he's doing you see God's purposes are above all things folks that's the main thing praise the Lord you just know that that God's purposes are above all things and his purpose will be saved amen and when we know that our name is in the Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life I beg your pardon then we can rest on that Hallelujah ain't going to be rubbed out you're going to be there amen and as brother Donnie said the other night and a few other people you know when it all the Rapture comes I'm going to be there amen that's it as long as I'm there so you make sure to the same thing this morning amen praise the Lord now manasa listen I just if I could read this for a second I go on as fast as I can here um I might have to leave some of the said but you'll understand that and the Lord speak to Manas unto the people but they would not hearken and wherefore the Lord brought unto them the captains of the host of the king of Syria which took Manasseh among the thorns and burned him with feathers he burned with feathers chins and carried him to Babylon so that was that's where he ended up amen it wasn't very nice and when he was in Affliction he besought the Lord as God now I was thought he was just a wicked old man he died a wicked old man but I'm not not so and so he besov the Lord as God some something of his daddy must have rubbed off him and uh humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom and then manasse knew that the Lord he was God and he was a changed man amen now uh praise the Lord because look what the good he goes on to do and he took away the strange gods and the idol the idol out of the house of the Lord and all the altars that he had built in the M of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem he cast them out of the city amen wow that's wonderful and he repaired the altar of the Lord amen sacrificed peace offerings thank offerings commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel nevertheless the people did sacrifice in high places but only to the Lord so what I want to say is humility Works amen and if God needs to make me humble then Lord Make Me humble amen praise God but it really works amen if he hadn't humbled himself that story would not have finished as it did amen and so let your let your clothes be humility folks and it's just like a you know when you can stand up in the front of the people and say oh God I thank you I'm so humble well there's something wrong there's something wrong humility like you couldn't bring in a sheep in the day there and say night do you know how much wool you've grown in the last 6 months that sheep would look up to you like the horses last night and they say pardon you know it doesn't care about how much grow world it's growing it's just as long as the grass is there it's SE in the grass and that's the way it is with humility it's a cloth that you're covered with but you don't even realize it amen praise the Lord okay Hallelujah well God is interested in your heart amen and we've went through that now if we can just get into this uh next one here amen praise the Lord now uh he says uh that while they were in the wilderness God give them the Mana amen and uh praise the Lord yes so I've I've actually missed a page here so it's a good thing because our time will not allow it but you'll find it there all in Exodus 16 about the Mana and uh praise the Lord uh that her they didn't that's what it means Mana means what is it they didn't even know what it was and I was looking at the the the the the Jew on the grass this morning as I come out and when that Jew would have been burnt up with the the rising of the sun there was the Mana spread all over the Wilderness it must have been a beautiful sight you know and they were told to go out and and to to do it amen and hard to do it and and God always uh gives you instructions amen he doesn't leave it up to your own uh whatever you think he tell you what the best way to do things and it is the best way to do things that's the Glorious about it it those his ways are always the best and so amen and uh he did fill them and you can read all that there in Exodus it's a beautiful uh chapter to to read it and it tasted like like uh like olive oil amen now if you have your salad and you know sometimes they just toss the solid and it's got a oil on it you know and you you can feel the oily taste you know and I been thinking what I'm doing that brother that's like the Mana it would have had that like oily taste of it you know and of course not only that but amen and you could really home in here I did at my home church and go through all the different things and how they were instructed about three and a half pounds or something of it uh and how they were instructed to to to get it and you know folks you would never dream of taking two meals a day after one another like you wouldn't take two breakfasts would you right you wouldn't think of it well let's say you did and you had two breakfasts and there you I've got that breakfast in 1:00 comes and you start into your dinner you know and then about 3:00 you said well that's my first dinner now it's time for my second dinner so what are you doing that for well just to carry me over the weekends oh you don't do it like that do you and you come to supper time and you're eating your your sa supper and you're on your knees goping for air you know you don't do it like that that would be nonsense you it's provided for the day and so is the Mana Hallelujah you don't say well I'll get a week's worth here and God said said no that's not the way to do it amen and so praise the Lord it it it says in 31:31 and the house of Israel called it Mana it was like a COR under seed White and the taste of it was like wers made with honey so real Honey in the Rock Amen and it's good for you the Bible says and that's what I eat a lot uh not a lot but I eat the honey every day put it that way amen and it's done me no harm so I'm thanking God for it amen but the word of God is like that and remember remember it's the commission and and Revelation 10 uh and what 8 to1 and no no no yeah 8 to1 where it says you're commanded to eat the book or you're to partake of the book amen partake of it make it part of you and it will taste like honey in your mouth and that's what the word of God the word of God is Pleasant all his past and all his ways are pleasantness all his paths are peace friends amen you just have to experience that you just got to test and see that the Lord is good and you know that is a thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste amen you might say well the world's not like that I'm not in the world Amen I don't care what the world do Hallelujah I I I I don't really care you know uh maybe the president this morning

give you amen and so here he was and it never did run out always fresh and sweet and new one by the years went by and any man that comes to Christ and hides away and the veil falls behind him he's in the presence of the almighty God you know when I was uh still working in the factory on the maintenance and uh yet of all I get up early enough to be able to read my Bible and pray every morning while I was getting up at 7 it didn't matter I W that time with the Lord before I went out on the day's Excursion you know and uh praise the Lord now I that I would be called retired that means that means this it means that when I have my breakfast I can spend time with God and I'm not in a hurry I'm not looking at the clock and saying oh you better finish in 5 minutes uhoh not anymore brother deck I can sit there and if I'm enjoying that Mana I tell yeah I'm just eating away at it leave me alone amen and we'll see what comes next and it's wonderful amen and it'll keep you in perfect health Hallelujah yes it will now and it says and any man that comes to Christ and HIDs away that Veil Falls he's in the presence of almighty God eating Mana night and day uh one hour to the other it's just always as sweet as it was the first day of tell telling it to your soul amen now this is what it was uh we don't realize we don't realize folks that you've heard many messages on the old the Old Testament about the high priest he's the only one that could go in there but yet we can go in to the same place not just into the outer court and shake hands you not only just the Holy Holy oh I recognize the church ages there the seven candlesticks and and here's the the the the show bread and and and the incense for prayer no you can go right on in right you as a believer can go right into the holy of holies right to the very throne room you know I love that oh thank God for the word amen where would you be if you didn't have the word this morning Hallelujah and Paul the Apostle says having therefore now are you going to be timid coming into that he says no he says having boldness to enter the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil even his flesh amen so you can come in it's there it's open and you can do it through the blood of Jesus and for what he sacrificed amen uh today amen so praise the Lord now uh I just want to move on right right fast uh notice the scripture uh teaching a historical God and just like they are trying to live in the past Wesley said so so and so and Luther said so and so and it's all good what they said but we don't want to live in the past we're not under the methus Revival we're under the bride Revival amen and so today uh you know and he always said that that it's the Revival that pass is the one that persecutes the present Revival so there's no we know that and we understand that and uh I was going to show the h a h videos of brother brandham uh one time and I I got a a call from a a Pentecostal Minister that said I had no right to show William Bram to the people I said what what are you talking about all the Catholic people would not understand understand that said do you understand it amen and I tell you what I calm that guy down and and but why did he even for me to say that you know what what was was on his mind and so so uh uh the next the next evening uh the pastor phoned up and the pastor seemed to be a converted Catholic and he said to me brother are you sure you're doing the right thing showing brother William Bram or he said just William Bram and I said excuse me sir I said what do you know could you tell me on the phone saying you phone me up could you tell me what you know about William brandham he says well well well actually not not a lot I said well tell me what you know well I don't know anything so I said so you're phoning me on the phone to tell me to do something that you know nothing about like I mean you know I mean does that make Aries to you or what you know you know and and I tell you what I said I seeing you fo me up and I did I said seeing you fo me up I said I'm going to fill you in this morning with your card I'm going to mark your card I'm going to take your box and I told him everything I knew about brother Bram Hallelujah and at the end of it he was just Gob smacked and he says well thank you very much and I said thank you very much I'll be showing them the films don't you worry about it so amen and refusing to eat the word today amen buzzards but not Eagles Hallelujah and and and certainly where the man is brother Bram says the Eagles are gathered tonight amen a man shall not live by bread alone let me get it right up to this while finish the next 10 if that's okay brother Samuel amen man shall not not but every word that proceed is that right so if if man is to live and they are the flock of God this church then they are to thrive upon the word and Mana of God and it's wonderful hallelujah it's wonderful uh to we we the brother that came across last year to us at for our anniversary it's in on the 9th of September or thereabouts and uh he he was preaching about that you have a name that you're living but are dead he said you know when you get sick or anything like God or you know you rush to a hospital they might think it's going to be a heart attack or something he said the first thing they do is check your Vital Signs that's what they do brother they want to get right down there no no messing about they want to find out what your heart's doing they want to find out how your blood pressure is is your brain active and all and when they've checked your Vital Signs they say okay it's not as bad as we thought you know we've got this under control cuz we know what's where you're standing and the brother went on and he said that's the same it is with with the bride amen look at here thriving on the word amen and just check your Vital Signs this morning ask yourself spiritually what are my Vital Signs like this morning have I still got the same hunger amen still am I thriving or is it just get common to me oh I could hear a message like God any time I could pray brother so and so there from Tennessee or whatever not you know brother and sister that's wrong amen hallelujah you're thriving on the word of God here hallelujah amen and you know Jesus said a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me hidden see not revealed hidden for I shall be with you even in you amen there's your hidden Mana Amen to the end of the world see Christ is that hidden Mana that comes from God out of Heaven that's what the prophet said and we are familiar with these things amen so praise the Lord let me just get right there it's to the Overcomer only amen n that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only see natural bread but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God do man live amen the first uh when I made this up and it just spoke to me uh the first thing I thought about is the first little illustration was in numbers where uh the people had been disobedient and God had sent the fiery serpents among them all and uh so you can read it there and the people speak against God against Moses and he sent the fiery serpents because they were complaining about Egypt they wanted to go back the garlic and the onions and the fish from the sea it was so nice you know you know you would be surprised how many people stay behind in Babylon when when isra and Nehemiah all them ones came across zable all that you'd be surprised to many stayed behind because it was a cushy number amen the Jews learned all their business over in Babylon and and thousands maybe tens of thousands of them stayed in Babylon but you see the remnant came back hallelujah it's always going to be a Remnant folks Amen to press on and so uh to the Overcomers now and here they were murmuring and complaining amen they could see no good at than nothing and uh uh they said oh our soul do love this bread that's what they said about the Mana our soul not our body we know we need to eat that but our soul that Lo it amen and God just had enough and you know that's right I tell you what you know I think brother Brown said that God run into patience with uh some sure did he sure did you're not going to try put my gifts on on show you know oh tie me up I can break it you know he lost patience you know so don't let God lose patience with you this morning amen and here they were and the Lord sent fairy serpents among them and uh praise the Lord that b them and and much people died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned you know God has way of making you it really does you know it keep you on your toes you know you might just get start to get relaxed and I'll take you next thing is your little crisis and I tell you P you back on your toes and get you back to prayer oh Lord amen see so he knows hard to do it with all of us and and here he was and and uh Moses prayed and and and the Lord told him to make that fiery serpent amen and you know it was so simple God in Simplicity you didn't have to have a diploma amen but hard to live in the wilderness but my goodness all you had to do was L and live that's all and can you imagine that there would have been people there that said that's too simple how could looking at a bra snake on a pole heal me I need a doctor get me a good doctor from Egypt and he'll get me right that's not what God Said folks if you're going to live by every word of God here you are right here in this story what are you going to do right is it going to be too simple for you have you got beyond that and he turned run and he said amen look that's all you got to do you didn't have to pay any money you didn't have to buy any first ID Kats or nothing like that you just had to look Hallelujah and something happened in your body you would feel it hallelujah hallelujah and you were healed why because you believe what God Said oh I love it Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away we know it's there it's going to be fulfilled but as he said my my word will not pass away my word will not pass away amen now let us get on so there's a story of just obeying what God Said simple but obeying it and you live amen right uh praise the Lord you know when he was met the devil when he met the devil in the up there in the wilderness amen I remember preaching to you about how the word came to the prophet but the spirit came to the word hallelujah and L him out and anointed him amen and there he Feast the devil up with that praise God it is written Amen brother BR said but the gifts he could have used him or whatever not to defeat the enemy but he used his word amen the word of God that defeats the enemy anywhere anytime it really does and he met him with the word and you know you say well that's okay that's that was the Lord and brother BR but you know something he said the weakest Christian doing the same my if if the Devil Comes Your away in some form or ship this week why don't you meet him with a word hallelujah you're a Son of God a daughter of God you can quote the word hallelujah and he can say anything to you amen but you encamped about with a a a wonderful firey heads amen and it's wonderful and he said the weakest Christian can take that stand and hold it before the devil amen and he'll defeat him amen uh I I I don't know but I tell you what friends uh I think there's going to be more of a falling away that's my own personal opinion I could be wrong but I don't think so because the Bible says that God is going to shake everything that can be shaken everything going to shake his house to nothing amen hallelujah and I'll tell you what praise God he's going to shake it amen and and I brother Samuel I cannot understand it in my heart right that any man could say that I don't believe that brother brunham fulfills Revelation 10:7 you know when the prophet through the church he book if you can read where he doesn't fulfill it then you're in the wrong message you're in the wrong message I tell you and if we're going to believe every word hallelujah we're going to have to see what God has Vindicated amen we're going to have to see the interpretation of how God's interpreted by Vindication amen and uh praise the Lord uh we're going to have to believe it so certainly we believe it today amen uh you know I've heard some messages about the token being displayed in your life amen and that's true the token Life of Christ people should see you're a Christian amen you might be a weak one but that you're a Christian anyway Hallelujah no thank you in the Holy cigarette outa no I don't smoke why do you not smoke cuz I'm a Christian that's all that's all Hallelujah and so when I see the blood that's the word of God it'll stand forever we believe it Hallelujah we believe it amen the token Life of Christ amen the spiritual food and and Je season amen uh Christ revealed a word hallelujah the son of man the body word of the son of man amen uh you know when brother Donnie rean was preaching he said if you read that scripture he said go home and read the next one behind it you know what it says remember Lot's wife just think about that oh the son of man's going to be revealed and then but remember at that very time remember Lot's wife when he's been revealed to Abraham up there lot's down there in Sodom his wife oh I don't want to leave I look all this and she looks R cuz that's where her heart is where your treasure I preach it back home where your treasure is that is where your heart is also Hallelujah and thank God I don't have any Treasures down here amen hallelujah praise God wonderful amen look at the Ten Commandments they're all the word of God Amen and I you know folks it's just the way it's meant to be Hallelujah everybody's doing what they have to do praise God Russia's doing China's doing how what's China going to do China could even be greater than any of us know here they almost done the United States of America you know that sure amen but I'll tell you what praise God it don't matter Hallelujah cuz it's all going to fulfill the Divine Purpose of almighty God Amen and The Ten Commandments they may take them to the schools they may do whatever they want Hallelujah but they can't stop you praying oh they can't come up to you in the street and say you praying you know they just can't do it so don't matter we're going through hallelujah we're going through amen no yeah the prophet said that with W with with with h Noah his whole purpose in life was to build that Ark and I tell you what our whole purpose is in is to be not Rapture Hallelujah I want that Millennium Hallelujah I want to fellow with these men here are young again Hallelujah and and be under our own vine tree and fake tree Hallelujah I and I know you want the see and that's what our whole thing should be uh on Amen so we love them Commandments we love the ordinances that brother bham left us amen and hearing the word of God and keeping it amen that's what Jesus said we believe it ha everlasting life amen praise God I don't care if the the priest doesn't believe it well you're not a Catholic how are you going to go it doesn't bother me folks Hallelujah I'd say Sir you're the one that should be saying H are you going to go amen hallelujah I know where I'm going I know where I came from and I know where I'm going amen now have faith in God that's the word we believe every word and you know just ask yourself one question okay just ask yourself one question is your 25 cents still in your pocket yeah you know this is true I hope you don't mind let me take

trousers in his whole life the whole thing about him just almost disgusting you could say yeah and every so often he got so low that They Carried him in the hospital and of course the nurses and washed them up scrubbed them up got him in his gear and all that in the bed and they would start to feed him up all after a week or two he was just right as R and he went back right to the same thing

you could go right back to Eve Eve didn't believe every word that was a trouble and so amen but of believing every word you've got three Witnesses you've got one here in Deuteronomy you've got it there with the Lord amen and then you can come right up to the the last book of the Bible and it says whosoever shall add one word or take one word from it there's God giv you a whole Panorama of that whole thing amen and he said I'll remove his name amen out of that book of life no so praise God that we go without that amen and every word of God is true whether it's a prophecy whether it's a promise you just lay hold on it amen and let God speak to you sir amen let him speak to you and and see what he says says about you amen praise God it could be a proclamation of God behold I come quickly let him come quickly to you whatever it is don't matter a pronouncement or a command What He commands you to do amen hallelujah just do it amen that's the way we live hallelujah praise God this is the things if you abide in me and I abide in you and this is really I I I'll finish up right on this here I can finish n one minute praise the Lord you know brother Bram says don't become a Bible hitchhiker I thought that's a strange title a Bible hitch hacker you know and you know what a hitch hacker is where are you going I don't know where are you getting off I don't know wherever you put me off you know to get a Li and they're hopping bopping about you know but we don't want to be like God in the Bible we want to be uh grounded and settled Hallelujah and the word of God and uh we know where we're going um like that we don't want to be a Bible hitch hacker amen so Jesus defeated the devil with that word amen quoted it and do you know something that I could even say here uh you'd be surprised but when Satan came to the Lord and contested with him about you know you're hungry change him to bread well of course he could have did that of course Moses could have just smoked the rock once and said you know but he didn't he smoked it twice but this was the word itself amen and when he did that the devil did not contest him I think about that the devil when he said man shall not live by bread alone the devil didn't say well hold on a wa minute you know he didn't say nothing cuz he knew amen it's like jackm you know you can't move Hallelujah I've got you Hallelujah you've came to the wrong thing today you've come to the word today Hallelujah and the word will always right quote that amen I love it praise the Lord so amen now the prophet said and this is me write down one word broken can break the whole chain so that's why everything that God says and it's hard when he said love your enemies that's not that's not easy but you can do it hallelujah amen and and and and some Wicked people about but I tell you what just love your just let the love of God flow through you and that's what it takes cuz you'll never do it in the natural amen somebody look you can say well brother there's somebody at work I remember somebody in my job they were the same very hard brother than me and I'll tell you what but but boy did I get the Victory and when I got the victory I knew it and every time after that that guy didn't even know in my presence he didn't even know where he stood cuz I had the victory amen and I'll tell you what it's wonderful Hallelujah and and the Lord will judge us by his attitude to his word amen and praise the Lord as I said earlier what would we do oh friends what would we do if this word wasn't available to us today amen look at the things that the prophet has taught us amen what would we do if we didn't have an end time message we would just be walling about like a hog you know we wouldn't know where we were going you know we wouldn't oh my I'm so glad I'm so glad amen and uh it is it's the sacred word of God now this is the last quote said you know we have to do something another to settle the end of strife so there's no Strife there should be no Strife in your life amen there should not be and and the word there should be no Strife just you believe that message and all that Christ was he poured into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work that's what he's done amen and his word might continually live amen he live by the word of the father man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that prees out of the mouth of God see that's the only way we can live spiritually and so it says uh uh it says uh by the word of Christ amen that's why the church don't live in bread alone but by the word of Christ and the Holy Spirit comes in takes the word of Christ makes it a living action today and these sins shall follow them that believe so I trust and pray now listen Hallelujah today you know God has got strange I I I I felt I felt in my heart God was going to speak to folks this morning I just felt that Hallelujah and you know whatever whatever you you just may be something today that's there
