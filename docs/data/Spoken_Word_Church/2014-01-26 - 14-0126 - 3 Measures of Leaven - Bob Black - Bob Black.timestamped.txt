[0:13] all right we're going to turn to Matthew
[0:17] chapter
[0:26] 1333 right on
[0:28] time
[0:30] how many enjoyed brother Ryan Sunday
[0:32] school
[0:36] lesson about say where he is there he is
[0:40] he hiding from you on on God's parenting
[0:43] of us and wisdom that was good
[0:44] appreciate
[0:46] that Matthew
[0:50] 13:33 and
[0:52] um you know last last few times we were
[0:55] talking about um
[0:57] on claiming our inheritance and how God
[1:00] gives us our inheritance and how Joshua
[1:02] compares to Ephesians and and how your
[1:05] inheritance is the statute of perfect
[1:06] man is your inheritance and moving on up
[1:08] into God's blessings and how God
[1:10] continues to give you his grace uh uh
[1:14] just keeps piling on greater and greater
[1:17] Graces to you after you receive the Holy
[1:19] Ghost until you come into the full
[1:21] stature of perfect man and come into an
[1:23] image where God can look at you and see
[1:25] his own reflection back and uh we when
[1:28] we look at into God's word you know Paul
[1:30] talked about how this is supposed to be
[1:32] a mirror that we look in and and examine
[1:34] ourselves because the the the written
[1:37] word is God and letter form so we can
[1:39] look into God's written word and compare
[1:41] ourselves back our life and and see how
[1:43] it matches up we can read in in Isaiah
[1:46] and you know how he was talking about
[1:48] how he'll bring the people bring Israel
[1:50] back to his holy mountain well what
[1:52] makes the mountain holy I was listening
[1:54] brother Brown talk about this on the way
[1:55] to church this morning what makes the
[1:57] mountain holy is not a holy church or a
[1:59] holy building or a holy mountain is Holy
[2:03] because God is there God makes it holy
[2:05] when when the disciples came and and saw
[2:08] the uh Jesus on the mountain with Moses
[2:09] and Elijah oh this is a holy place but
[2:12] what made it holy was because God was
[2:13] there and and that's what makes it holy
[2:16] so um before we read this let's just go
[2:18] to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we
[2:21] thank you God for your grace to us for
[2:23] another hour another day to serve you
[2:24] Lord and to come around your word and
[2:27] fellowship Lord Jesus and I pray God
[2:29] that you'll be with us and just be with
[2:30] the service this morning and this
[2:32] afternoon and just be with us today Lord
[2:34] that we can glean a little bit more of
[2:36] the precious bread of life God help us
[2:39] Lord Jesus uh many are sick and
[2:41] Afflicted Lord Jesus and I pray that
[2:42] you'll touch us Lord because it's
[2:44] written in your word and it's your
[2:46] desire to heal us that you PID the way
[2:48] we just read that you uh you were
[2:50] wounded for our afflictions and you paid
[2:53] the price for our salvation and for our
[2:56] healing Lord and I pray God that you'll
[2:58] help us to believe it and accept it be
[3:00] with us this morning Lord Jesus and just
[3:01] open your word to us we ask in the name
[3:04] of the Lord Jesus
[3:06] Christ now Matthew 13:33 this is kind of
[3:10] an odd scripture that um uh many people
[3:15] don't really know what to do with cuz it
[3:17] seems kind of out of place
[3:20] um and it's also told in Luke
[3:23] 13221 that's the same kind of story and
[3:27] um so I'm going to read it
[3:31] another Parable spake he unto them the
[3:34] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leen
[3:37] which a woman took and hid in three
[3:39] measures of meal till the whole was
[3:42] leaven now now we we've been think
[3:44] talking about uh Joshua and how the
[3:47] children of Israel crossed over the
[3:49] river Jordan enter their inheritance and
[3:52] they they began fighting to claing back
[3:55] all of their now it just started as a
[3:56] little simple thing they crossed over
[3:58] the river Jordan and they began to to
[3:59] take bit by bit piece by piece their
[4:02] inheritance until um what was promised
[4:05] to them that was that everything that uh
[4:08] Abraham could see everywhere he went
[4:11] would be theirs and we've got that same
[4:13] promise today and and the way it works
[4:15] is is by a little bit at a time God
[4:19] magnifies himself in us and and and
[4:22] grows now I was I was thinking about
[4:25] um you know today uh we we have kind of
[4:30] through the message everybody kind of
[4:31] has different ideas and different things
[4:34] and that's kind of how the uh the early
[4:35] church was when the the apostles when
[4:38] you know they were walking with Jesus
[4:39] and they began to uh Talk Amongst one
[4:42] another who's going to be the greatest
[4:44] and and you know they were there was a
[4:45] little biger and fighting and and uh and
[4:48] and uh one had a little different idea
[4:50] about this and a different idea about
[4:52] that but then when they all came
[4:54] together they it they were in one Accord
[4:58] and something happened to bring them all
[5:00] into the unity of the faith so that they
[5:02] were all together and I I believe that's
[5:05] the same thing that happened there is
[5:08] happening in the bride today and that's
[5:09] what will take us in the Rapture is that
[5:12] is that what's written here in Matthew
[5:14] 13:33 will that leaven in us will will
[5:17] grow and grow until it consumes the
[5:20] whole the whole thing now talking about
[5:24] 11 it confuses it's kind of confusing
[5:27] because everywhere else in Scripture it
[5:29] seems like leaven is used to represent
[5:32] something that's not uh know the leav of
[5:35] the Pharisees and uh I just want to go
[5:38] through some of these examples in 1
[5:40] Corinthians
[5:41] 5:6 um and you don't have to turn there
[5:44] I'll just kind of read it your glorying
[5:46] is not good Paul said know ye not that A
[5:49] little leaven leth the whole lump now
[5:52] let's kind of look at this in context
[5:54] know you he said your gloring is not
[5:56] good know you not that a little leav
[5:58] leth the whole lump Now 1 Corinthians
[6:01] chapter 5 he's talking about that a man
[6:03] is is living with his father's wife and
[6:05] doing something that he ought not to do
[6:07] and and what that did was it brought in
[6:10] a bad example to the church and
[6:12] everybody began looking at that and that
[6:14] that little leaven that that one small
[6:18] bad thing Paul was concerned that people
[6:22] would look at that as an example and say
[6:25] well if he can get away with it I can
[6:27] too and and it would just begin to grow
[6:28] and grow into something that would over
[6:31] time consume and and just rot in the
[6:34] core like a bunch of apples when you
[6:36] when you put them in a bag they one
[6:38] apple will over time begin to rotten the
[6:40] whole thing and it will cause everything
[6:42] to just turn into a big uh mess and you
[6:45] don't have in the end you don't have
[6:47] what you started out with what you
[6:49] should have and um
[6:53] Galatians
[6:55] 5'9 a little 11 11 at the whole lump mhm
[7:00] yep turn over there if I can
[7:04] remember
[7:24] one
[7:26] sorry I just took very sporadic
[7:37] notes ah I just had to refresh my memory
[7:41] about what this chapter was about so
[7:44] Galatians 5:1 it stand fast there
[7:46] therefore in the Liberty where Christ
[7:47] hath made us free and be not entangled
[7:48] again with the Yol of bond bondage so
[7:51] Christ deal Paul is dealing with the the
[7:53] idea amongst the Believers that that
[7:54] they were justified by the law instead
[7:57] of justified by being born again being
[7:59] filled with God's presence in their life
[8:01] and and they they in into their among
[8:05] their midst came the idea that you know
[8:06] they had to still have to respect some
[8:08] of the old uh law like circumcision and
[8:11] and uh keeping of a particular day and
[8:13] things like that and
[8:16] uh so Paul's saying that he's using a
[8:19] little 11 11 if the whole lump that idea
[8:22] that little teaching had God in amongst
[8:24] their midst that they still had to be
[8:26] circumcised that they uh that they had
[8:28] to respect that
[8:29] they didn't understand that God was
[8:32] unfolding himself in a greater way that
[8:34] now he was circumcising the heart
[8:36] instead of just the Flesh and uh so he's
[8:41] he's he's concerned about just a little
[8:44] a little teaching beginning to grow into
[8:47] something greater and you know in the
[8:50] when brother R was teaching the Seven
[8:51] Seals that's that's one of the things
[8:53] you know Paul saw that mystery of
[8:55] iniquity start out just a little mystery
[8:57] just a little something that turned into
[8:59] the Antichrist that began to magnify
[9:01] until it turned into that pale horse
[9:03] rider just consumed everything it it uh
[9:06] the the whole something that started off
[9:09] small magnified until it become greater
[9:11] and greater and and that's how it is
[9:13] when with the Born Again believer when
[9:15] you when you're born again you get that
[9:17] little brother R talked about the little
[9:18] speck of that little white Speck or
[9:21] however we explain it and it it begins
[9:23] to grow and grow and grow and grow until
[9:27] we're in unity with God in unity with
[9:31] his word and we can say the same thing
[9:34] that he does there's not we don't look
[9:35] at the Bible and say well I don't I'm
[9:37] not 100% sure of what this scripture
[9:39] means I'm not sure what what what's
[9:41] going on here and now now if we look at
[9:45] go back to Matthew
[9:50] 1333 look at this scripture and
[9:53] think you know I've heard some say that
[9:57] well Lev's got to be
[9:59] be got to be bad because it seems bad in
[10:03] all the other references you know in the
[10:05] Old Testament there was the Feast of
[10:07] unleavened bread where you go seven days
[10:09] without eating unleavened bread and you
[10:10] know today they celebrate that by hiding
[10:12] the little uh the little leaven pieces
[10:15] of bread throughout the house and they
[10:16] have a little the ritual where they go
[10:18] and they find it uh all throughout the
[10:20] house and they kind of clean things out
[10:23] now now so what they're doing was
[10:25] they're going and finding the the uh the
[10:29] the teaching the false Doctrine just you
[10:32] know CU false Doctrine gets in the midst
[10:33] and begins to grow and grow false
[10:35] teaching grows until it it it begins to
[10:38] change the way you act it changes the
[10:40] way you uh it changes the direction of
[10:42] your life so now uh the the the Kingdom
[10:45] of Heaven is lik UN the leaven which a
[10:48] woman took and hid in three measures of
[10:51] meal till the whole was leaven now if
[10:54] this leaven is bad then then the whole
[10:56] of the kingdom of God is leavened with
[10:58] this leaven and it ends up being a
[11:00] polluted Kingdom so it cannot be a a bad
[11:03] kind of living it cannot be a uh a
[11:06] corrupting a defiling kind of living but
[11:08] what 11 is is the teaching is is the
[11:11] teaching and uh so what happens is this
[11:14] this woman you know uh that scripture I
[11:18] read Wednesday night about the elect
[11:20] lady uh John would addressed his address
[11:23] to the elect lady there's an elect lady
[11:26] that's going to hide the teaching these
[11:28] he Mysteries of the Gospel in her heart
[11:31] through three pools through uh you know
[11:34] when you you can you can take a look at
[11:37] these three uh the three measures of
[11:39] living there's there's a shout and
[11:40] there's a voice and there's a trump
[11:42] there's a justification sanctification
[11:44] baptism the Holy Ghost and it just keeps
[11:46] going on up there's there's three stages
[11:48] of justification a higher and higher and
[11:50] higher and and God is drawing Us by the
[11:53] revealing of his word and the only thing
[11:54] that will help us to take a body change
[11:57] that will help us to line up with his
[11:58] word is to is that these Hidden
[12:00] Mysteries be revealed to us and now go
[12:04] back to that story in Pentecost what
[12:06] what United them together what United
[12:10] them together around God's word and
[12:12] together in one Accord was that God did
[12:15] something personal he visited each one
[12:18] of them
[12:19] individually an individual visitation
[12:22] over each one of their heads was a
[12:25] pillar of fire was a little lick of fire
[12:28] an individ ual visitation now uh uh my
[12:32] my dad likes has an expression he likes
[12:34] to say that there's there you know the
[12:35] Bible says there's no private
[12:37] interpretation but there is private
[12:39] Revelation and that's such a mystery
[12:42] that you know in church that as the
[12:44] preachers preaches somewhere of the
[12:45] pulpit that you can catch something that
[12:47] the person beside you might not and
[12:49] maybe next time next next service they
[12:51] might catch something that you don't
[12:53] because God reveals it's a personal
[12:56] revelation God's dealing with each
[12:58] person individually and that is what
[13:01] unites us together with god with his
[13:03] word with his bride all uniting together
[13:05] you know that message the Oneness
[13:07] brother Brown talked about when before
[13:09] you listen to that you think well he's
[13:10] going to talk about um uh the godhead
[13:15] but he's talking about becoming one
[13:17] Christ becoming one with his bride right
[13:20] Christ joining and this is how he does
[13:22] it by by taking the leaven of his word
[13:27] that's a little bit and beginning to
[13:28] just letting it uh magnify until it
[13:32] takes you over until it just consumes
[13:34] you and you know if you this is maybe a
[13:37] strange illustration because I don't
[13:39] cook or anything I I don't know nothing
[13:40] about cooking but if you uh just to
[13:42] illustrate if you if you put a little uh
[13:46] a little leav in this
[13:47] building and then you would over time if
[13:50] you kind of let it created the right
[13:53] atmosphere then the the leaven would
[13:55] consume the whole building and now this
[13:58] was that's that's what Steven was
[14:00] talking about in his address when they
[14:01] they uh put him pulled him before the
[14:03] council he said you know Solomon built
[14:05] God a house he built a building but he
[14:08] God's plan and purpose was not for him
[14:11] to dwell in a building made by hands his
[14:13] plan and purpose was for him to dwell in
[14:15] a temple of Flesh now if you go back and
[14:18] look at in the in the church age book in
[14:20] the Ephesian Church age that's what
[14:21] brother Brown he he illustrate he just
[14:24] spells it right out God's great plan and
[14:25] purpose was for you for him to come and
[14:28] live and human flesh and remember the
[14:31] the the the three mysteries revealed in
[14:33] in that brother talked about in Christ
[14:35] The Mystery of God revealed that we're
[14:36] open in the seventh seal that God will
[14:38] reveal himself in Christ and God would
[14:41] reveal himself in his bride and then God
[14:43] would return and and bring back Fallen
[14:45] even back to its original condition now
[14:47] all three of those are around God
[14:50] revealing himself in human flesh God
[14:52] putting himself inside the Flesh of
[14:54] people and that's what this is dealing
[14:56] with that God takes takes his word and
[14:59] hides it inside inside his his elect
[15:03] lady and it begins to grow and grow
[15:05] until it consumes everything now now the
[15:09] the
[15:10] uh the thing is
[15:13] that the wife in Revelation
[15:16] 197 it says let us be glad and rejoice
[15:19] and give honor to him for the marriage
[15:21] of the Lamb has come and his wife ha
[15:24] made herself ready his wife ha made
[15:27] herself ready
[15:29] and you a lot of times we think that uh
[15:33] uh it's it's something that you have to
[15:36] participate in because the wife makes
[15:39] you remember that Parable in the in the
[15:41] Bible about the uh the the woman that
[15:43] lost one of the coins and she was so
[15:46] concerned she she went sweeping up the
[15:48] whole house because she was involved she
[15:51] was involved and she wanted to go find
[15:53] that that coin and get it back in her in
[15:55] that little thing that goes in her head
[15:57] and I saw a picture in National
[15:59] Geographic of of in the Eastern culture
[16:02] they have there was a lady in National
[16:04] Geographic they had one of those with
[16:05] the the coins in her head and I thought
[16:08] that was really interesting if I can
[16:09] find it maybe I'll bring it in one time
[16:11] but um so it uh in 2 Corinthians 10:5
[16:17] what speaks about what this leevan is
[16:20] doing casting down imaginations and
[16:23] every High thing that exalteth itself
[16:25] against the knowledge of God and
[16:27] bringing into captivity every thought to
[16:31] The Obedience of Christ now think Joshua
[16:35] Ephesians going taking the land uh when
[16:39] you sit down at your at your uh at the
[16:41] little take play or play Then you bring
[16:44] in captivity all of the thoughts that
[16:46] are contrary to the word by hearing the
[16:49] message hearing the word when you come
[16:50] to church that's why it's so important
[16:52] to come to church and to keep to read
[16:54] your Bible and and and pray and and
[16:57] listen to the T
[16:59] because you're you're feasting on that
[17:01] Lev now remember leav is not bad in of
[17:03] itself leav is teaching if it's a bad
[17:06] teaching is bad if it's the teaching of
[17:09] the word then it's good and we want that
[17:11] levven to grow and increase in our lives
[17:13] and I I want to keep saying that because
[17:16] I I know many people have a problem with
[17:18] that that uh that
[17:21] Levan it just it maybe a little Cog in
[17:25] the wheel that we kind of bump over that
[17:28] leaven is something bad but leaven is
[17:31] teaching and we bringing into captivity
[17:35] every thought to The Obedience of the
[17:38] Christ now this is why this is why the
[17:41] three pools now I heard brother Dale
[17:43] explain like this and and uh I hope he
[17:45] remembers and if he listens to this but
[17:48] he he explained it like uh the the first
[17:50] pool is the opening of the word and the
[17:52] second pole is opening a little bit more
[17:54] and the third pool is opening it even
[17:56] more opening it even more and more and
[17:59] more opening it Greater because it's the
[18:02] word of God what what justifies you is
[18:04] the word of God what sanctifies you is
[18:06] his word in in John 17 he said
[18:10] sanctify sanctify them by thy truth Thy
[18:13] word is truth his word is what cleanses
[18:15] us and sanctifies us and then he
[18:17] baptizes us with the Holy Ghost to bring
[18:20] the word to life and that that's what
[18:21] the Holy Ghost is is the birth of the
[18:24] word in you the birth of the word being
[18:25] quickened the spirit and the word coming
[18:27] together to make that seed that's been
[18:29] Bor birth in you and then through the
[18:31] statute of a perfect man that word keeps
[18:33] growing and growing the leaven uh
[18:35] magnifying magnifying until you come
[18:38] into the per stature of a perfect man
[18:41] that's right now so Matthew 3 1333 is
[18:46] the the woman is the
[18:47] church and she's hid she's hiding a
[18:51] secret message inside of her heart that
[18:52] nobody knows about but her because it's
[18:54] a perfect a private Revelation it's
[18:57] something personal to you
[18:59] everybody
[19:01] clear and with time the Le begins to
[19:05] Le and it just begins to push out and
[19:15] um and as it's pushed out then you begin
[19:18] to realize who you are and who God is
[19:22] and what you're doing here now I I I was
[19:25] thinking on this that that uh you
[19:27] remember brother BR pulled up beside
[19:29] that the mountain peaks and he saw the
[19:31] Seven Peaks with his name written on it
[19:34] now what's so amazing is not that just
[19:37] God pointed that out to him but that
[19:40] that those Seven Peaks were put there
[19:42] before the foundation of world that when
[19:45] the world was created God molded the
[19:48] Seven Peaks into the into the he put his
[19:52] name there he put He molded the Seven
[19:54] Peaks to form to represent the seven
[19:58] stages of his ministry and it it
[20:00] represented brother brandom and and I
[20:02] think that's how the the Believers are
[20:05] when we look into God's word then we can
[20:08] see ourself that was in God's word
[20:11] before the foundation of the world and
[20:13] when the Seven Seals open to you then
[20:15] you begin to see your name written you
[20:17] begin to see that you were there in God
[20:20] by by not not you uh you understand not
[20:24] not like a little person back there or
[20:26] or not like U because the word is
[20:28] predestinated eternal that's right but
[20:31] so let's go to um Ezra chap
[20:41] 2 that is Page
[20:48] 529 or we actually
[20:52] 531 I I just want to quickly read this
[20:55] little
[20:57] story
[21:01] Ezra chapter 2 verse
[21:13] 61 this is a very obscure little
[21:16] story that that maybe I can shed some
[21:19] light on this
[21:23] morning Ezra chapter
[21:25] 2 Ezra 2 chapter uh verse
[21:34] 61 so what what what this is talking
[21:36] about is that the children of Israel
[21:38] they came out of uh you know uh uh they
[21:41] were down in in Babylon and and Daniel
[21:44] read in Jeremiah they were going to come
[21:46] out after 70 years and and they came out
[21:48] and and and they were they were turned
[21:50] back to their Homeland and they were
[21:51] they were they began to look in the
[21:53] books that the Levites did who who is um
[21:58] who should be a priest and so they began
[22:00] to look into the record of the genealogy
[22:03] just like we're looking now into the
[22:05] record of God's word to see if we can
[22:08] find oursel there and we find oursel
[22:10] there by the opening of the word not
[22:13] your actual name written down but your
[22:16] the revelate god reveals to you who he
[22:19] is and shows you how you fit in with
[22:21] God's plan so let's look at verse 61 and
[22:24] of the children of the priests the
[22:26] children of habah the children of CA the
[22:29] children of barel which took a wife of
[22:32] the daughters of barel the gileadite and
[22:35] was called after their name now that's
[22:37] interesting because baral and it's been
[22:39] a while since I read this story but
[22:40] baralai was a a man of great Renown that
[22:43] followed David after David uh uh uh went
[22:48] through all of his trials and you know
[22:49] they pushed David out th threw him out
[22:52] so what they did was they instead of
[22:54] taking on God's name they took the name
[22:58] name of or the name that God had given
[23:00] them their inheritance the place that
[23:02] God had put them in they took on the
[23:04] name of some some great man now he was
[23:07] really a great man he was an amazing man
[23:10] there's many amazing men but I want
[23:13] God's name I want to be found in him I I
[23:16] don't want to be uh uh you know Oral
[23:19] Roberts and TL Osborne they're all
[23:21] wonderful great men but I I want to
[23:23] follow Christ you understand and and not
[23:27] and and so what what what happened down
[23:29] through the the seven Church ages people
[23:31] began to take on well I'm I'm going to
[23:33] be a Catholic I'll I'll be a uh I'll be
[23:37] a Methodist I'll be a Baptist and they
[23:38] so they took on other names instead of
[23:41] God's
[23:43] name and so it says in verse 62 these
[23:46] sought their register among those that
[23:48] were reckoned by genealogy but they were
[23:51] not found therefore were they as
[23:54] polluted put from the priesthood now
[23:57] there is your leavon that is not the
[24:00] right kind of leavon they were found as
[24:02] polluted because they had the wrong kind
[24:04] of Leon they had the wrong desire the
[24:07] wrong the the wrong thing had been sown
[24:10] in them they had they were putting their
[24:13] trying to take on the name of
[24:15] Blasphemous names trying to take on the
[24:17] name of something that was other than
[24:20] what they what was
[24:22] correct and the T tatha said unto them
[24:26] that they should not eat of the most
[24:27] holy things Till There stood up a priest
[24:31] with urum and with thum how about that
[24:34] and now today we have the urum and the
[24:38] thumb because that urum and thumb flash
[24:41] to show what their name was now today we
[24:45] have this the urum and thumm of God's
[24:47] word that we can open up and see if
[24:50] we're in there if see what what what I
[24:53] whether we're part of that elect
[24:55] lady and if you're not then uh you know
[25:00] they the these priests they they could
[25:01] not partake of the Holy things they
[25:03] could not they they were in a bad
[25:07] situation and it's kind of like Nehemiah
[25:10] and Ezra when they came out of Babylon
[25:12] they began they knew that somewhere deep
[25:14] down under the rubble the foundation of
[25:17] the temple lay they knew it was under
[25:20] there somewhere and so they began to dig
[25:23] and now that's kind of like how we when
[25:25] we we look in the word you don't
[25:27] understand things you don't really
[25:30] understand what's maybe what's happening
[25:32] but if you just keep digging and just
[25:35] keep shoveling a little bit then over
[25:38] time you'll hit a Little Rock you'll hit
[25:40] a little there's a foundation stone
[25:42] there's something that I remember that
[25:44] was written of by Jeremiah or or the
[25:46] prophets and it begins to just come up
[25:48] out of the rubble till you can see it
[25:51] and then God begins to build on top of
[25:53] that just like Nehemiah and Ezra began
[25:55] to build on top of that Foundation that
[25:57] was there under the rubble and they just
[26:00] they build and build that's leav on top
[26:02] of Le God's word teaching teaching on
[26:05] top of teaching until it takes you
[26:08] over
[26:10] now we got five
[26:12] minutes so I was going to read this uh
[26:15] this little quote about the third
[26:22] pool and I'll finish on this this is
[26:25] Brother brandom's little illustration
[26:27] about
[26:28] uh the third pole when he was fishing
[26:29] and so he took and he said tie on the
[26:31] lure and I slap snapped The Lure on he
[26:34] said now throw way out now listen close
[26:37] way out into the deep because that's
[26:40] where you catch the big fish that's my
[26:42] thought into the deep way out into the
[26:45] deep not in the shallow water but in the
[26:48] Deep In The Deep hidden mysteries of
[26:50] God's word the opening of The Seven
[26:52] Seals yes the opening of a personal
[26:56] revelation to you
[26:58] is that's what the big fish the rainbow
[27:00] Tri are interested in is the hidden
[27:02] mysteries of God word God's word now uh
[27:05] you know people come along with people
[27:07] have come along with with speaking in
[27:09] tongues and and uh different signs and
[27:11] different things but what really
[27:13] interest I believe what really interests
[27:14] everybody here is the opening of God's
[27:17] word the Deep hidden mysteries of his
[27:20] word and he said when you do now let the
[27:22] lur sink down first and then said pull
[27:26] it slow pulling it slow because that's
[27:30] how the the big fish are caught by
[27:34] pulling it slow and steady wins the race
[27:37] that's how you take a body change it's
[27:40] slow and steady feasting feasting on the
[27:43] word don't try to hurry hurry hurry
[27:45] because so many people have Falling by
[27:46] the wayside because they tried to hurry
[27:48] hurry hurry and try to Trump something
[27:50] up you know uh so many people I've seen
[27:54] that that would just just talk to you
[27:56] for hours and hours about the word and
[27:57] then all just one little thing comes up
[27:59] and they're gone and and because you
[28:01] know just be make sure that your rock
[28:05] solid and you're steady in God's word
[28:08] and that you have a personal revelation
[28:11] and just take it take it one step at a
[28:13] time pull it slow now that's really
[28:16] Fisherman's technique now the same one
[28:19] that taught brother brandom how to fish
[28:22] is the same one that taught Peter how to
[28:24] fish because one day Peter was tossing
[28:27] his net on the one side of the boat and
[28:30] he said this man came along named Jesus
[28:33] and said don't cast over on the other
[28:34] side what was the same water it was the
[28:37] same body of water but this man knew
[28:40] something special he knew how to
[28:43] instruct him how to do it in a spiritual
[28:46] way uh by faith to do it
[28:50] and so uh I'm going to get Sidra a
[28:53] little bit just keep reading so I he
[28:55] said then when you do now you feel some
[28:57] nibl at it but don't tell nobody what
[29:00] you're doing keep it to yourself and
[29:03] said then when you when you feel it
[29:05] nibble again said pull just a little a
[29:08] little bit but not too hard he said and
[29:11] then it'll pull away from the little
[29:13] fish and when they scatter that'll
[29:16] attract the big the attention of the big
[29:18] fish when they scatter when everybody
[29:21] else begins to run away and say uh make
[29:24] their websites and things the that cot
[29:27] catches attend big I wonder if there's
[29:29] something to this I wonder if you know
[29:32] everybody else is saying bad things and
[29:34] saying this there uh brother R was all
[29:37] right until he began to teach when he
[29:39] began to teach then he got off God's
[29:42] word and it catches the attention of the
[29:44] big
[29:46] fish and they'll grab it and said and
[29:48] that's the way you'll catch it said then
[29:49] when they buy on the third time set your
[29:51] hooked for the catch and I said I
[29:53] understand said but keep still don't
[29:56] tell nobody keep
[29:58] steal and we'll stop right
[30:05] there
