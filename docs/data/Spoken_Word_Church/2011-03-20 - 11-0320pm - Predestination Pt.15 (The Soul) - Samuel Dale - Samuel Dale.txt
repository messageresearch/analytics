across her today and said Genesis 1:26 and 27 we'll see how got that's down here we're still back here okay that's be going that way in predestination so we'll we'll get to that you know the Lord willing but amen Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now let's go to Ezekiel just one verse there Ezekiel 18:4 behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinth it shall die you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we may be a little lengthy I'll try not to be but I want to get what I have on my mind off and get it into unto you as to what I believe and uh and in that we can go from there and uh I know I realize that this is a bad day and a bad time upon the Earth but why should we be worried uh you know uh I think it's the greatest time that's ever been I think this is the end of all things the scripture said it's come upon us and I believe it and I believe that you know we're here we're here for a purpose right and I don't believe anybody can take your place I believe you're right here for where you're supposed to be and everything is right on time all right and you know that we have to be ready against that day and have to be uh you know no matter what comes or goes that we just put it into the hands of the Lord and trust him and uh you know and believe it and walk forward in the Lord all right now not to back up much but to just to just say a few words about this morning's message see we were talking about how that when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy that the prophet of God said that that was when the Plan of Redemption come into view well then he says that you know could that be when the the lamb was slain well and I hope you was listening and I won't say much about it but you know uh to me then if you try to to uh go too far back you're going to redeem yourself out of exist existance you know because it that way you can uh you can only handle it so far and then you you will have a problem and uh then if we try to go that way too far and go out of the the part of eternal life and keep in our hearts and our minds the thoughts of here we are and what we've been and what God has done for us then I believe we would would be going wrong there but see I know that in preaching and trying to explain to you that people will you know ridicule you for making statements and things you know and and they'll just say well we just we're just simple and we just you know we want to remain simple and we just believe everything the prophet said you know and all like that well that's well and good but um bring what the prophet has said and let's see you know because I've tried to bring to you all that I can about what the prophet has said you know the uh the quotes the things I I try to give them to you to see that's the reason I run them off and you know uh doing 8 and 10 pages of notes to try to get you to see at least well this is what the prophet had to say you know and and continue their own and say well you're just twisting it well uh it's all right just go ahead and do what you want to I I'm just going to continue on down through going on and when we walk off this Earth then uh we'll see what was right and wrong you know when it's all finished and uh you know I I'm just trying to be to explain to you what I believe amen because as I've kept saying to you that if you take all of the quotes and just use them for what ever you want them to be used then you can make brother brandom say anything you want to you say well we always was eternal well like right we've expressed that over and over I believe that I believe the eternal life that you have that's right by the new birth always was eternal see but I believe there was a time we was not Eternal right because of the Fallen condition what would be the fall and as I keep saying then you know if you always was eternal then there's no way to redeem there there's nothing to redeem you know that that's you know that's sensible to me but maybe it's not to everybody else but I that's just the way I think but you know I I try to bring it the best that I can and I believe that when you we started the going backward as I said you must be able to go backward as far as you can go forward in predestination and and to be able to see you know and uh I hope you caught where I ended it up this morning and I tried to this past Wednesday but really nailing it down this morning that when Jesus Christ stood there as the Creator God you know and begin to create that he was standing there and the prophet called it who is this melz a word formed body an IM morphe body all right we bypassed coming in in that imorph body yes because we there would have been no fall there was no way that Jesus could fall right there was no way see we had to be brought down into a condition to where that we could fall and given the opportunity and we did but the now not Jesus the flesh man back thereus where everybody gets me messed up because see when I say Jesus I'm not talking about the flesh that walked upon the shord of Galilee I'm talking about the God of Heaven because Jesus is his name right why can't I talk about him as being almighty God that's his name his name is Jesus he never had another name but see then I try to say Jesus Christ where you'll relate to it but see as he stood there then we can only be redeemed back as far as he was standing there and as he was standing there the great Eternal Loos theop El himself self existing God dwelling in a form word body theophany all right if we wasn't in him we will never be in him all right then he was a one word oneform body right then if we were in him then we would be what we would be the members of his body amen see part of him see and that way then that eternal life is him well then I thought we believe by coming here in a fallen condition that we by the new birth right would become a many membered body that's right but it's only one body there's only one David couldn't have he had a thousand wives but they couldn't have but one husband so really David didn't have one wife it was just a thousand members of it right all right Jesus Christ has got one body and we're members in particular to make up that body so we're just a display on Earth of that body that was back there right eternal life not these bodies get these things out of the way they're garbage right and look back into reality and and see see what's going on get away from your great wonderful Revelations you think get down to reality of just believing God right see then there was a great celebration in heaven we ended up by saying that what right when the morning stars and the sons of God saw the Plan of Redemption our Jesus Christ Revelations 18 138 to be slain before the foundation of the world and the Plan of Redemption would come into view then I hope you was listening to what I was saying see when we were there in him we then could know and understand what was going to take place that we were going to come into a condition upon Earth now see you know and as it did then that we would come to a place to receive eternal life and that would be God's Plan of Redemption and your soul by the new birth is just as Eternal as it'll ever be that's right your body was laying in the world we covered M right if not where did it come from the prophet said amen see then by laying in the world then it has to be brought to a place right Amen to where it can be made Eternal all right now what did your Prophet say I'm trying to think I think it's is it future home where he says that talking about Jesus at the River Jordan he said from that part of the earth that I've redeemed yeah that's right said I'll redeem the rest of it that's right man so then our bodies have a capability of being redeemed right am why because they come out of the earth and Jesus Christ come from this Earth not as the nasty sinful 16 elements but from the original word that created it that's right all right now but we'll get on to those things and cover some more things later but see then would it be a hard problem to look at it and really see that you know a fall was going to come because right that was the only way God could display his attributes was for a fallen condition now he couldn't make the condition be there right and then condemn us for being wrong that's right but he knew if he made us and gave us a choice look at Adam and Eve in the garden look at the wonderful position whatever you want to think about Eve look at the wonderful position that the woman was in right amen and yet through her thinking to her Desiring not necessarily sexual things her Desiring to know more about God caused her to fall into a condition yeah and take us with it right see then that's where we can stand all right now let's get on and I I don't want to try not too much time but I just want to make sure we cover some little things and then just step on over another step into what we're understanding but now remember anybody listening to this tape and you remember there is just one God that's right that's right there's never been two three 5 seven how many whatever there's never been but one true and living God Amen that word that we're talking about was God in another form am called the word when he was walking the shores of Galilee the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily all right then if we was back there in him now listen when he created the world then would it be any problem for the prophet to say that we was in him when he walked the shores of Galilee that's right amen now what was in him when he walked the shores of Galilee eternal life that's right eternal life amen and the full word of God so then we could be able to come forth in our designated decree time psalms about 139 see all right and then we could come forth as to be the bride of Christ right the many membered body that's right of the Lord Jesus Christ each member having eternal life because that's where we fell from M right I'll get to that in a minute you say we fail from eternal life what your Prophet had to say so you better listen but you be careful how you fall right that's right don't make eternal life fall right so you better stay awake this afternoon and if it takes me I would sorry I I try to finish as quick as I can but I don't want to get sufficed that I I get my mind going and I get ahead and my wife says you quote a lot of things wrong well you just put it in the right place I'm sorry I just do the best I can of trying to to preach the gospel all right now you just look down on your notes we follow along and we just kind of pick up things and we go and then we'll try to get a better understanding all right now if we wasn't a part of God talking about eternal life we never will be that's right all right that's right now so when he walked the shores of Galilee if we wasn't in him we never will be in him that's why he had to die to release that yep he had bottled up in him what we had need of that's why there was no people in the Old Testament could receive the new birth right there was no way sure they got eternal life on the basis of a promise but they're called the Servants of God right they're not called the sons and daughters but see that's who we are we are his children we're his offspring so watch what we're saying now and you just grab it as we try to go down identifications 1964 brother R says you are part of God and Jesus came to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts that's what he come to redeem he said then as soon as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there representation from predestination that's right but like I said now and that's where people listen they won't pay attention to what you're you're saying they just make you say things you don't say the little woman at the well right that's right but in her sinful condition she believed God's word right all right but see brother rown said see that word Was Made Alive all right amen but you know that didn't give her the new birth that's right you know the Virgin Mary that gave birth to the word that received the word standing down there as a little young girl and said be it unto me according to Thy word y you know that never gave her the new bir you know brother around said you people believe the mother of God since she had to pull in the upper room and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right amen see because the word is quick unto you doesn't mean that it gives you the new birth that's right the disciples on the road to AAS you remember I preached it they the two that was on the road he opened her understand it then he comes back with them and appears to all of the disciples and opens their understanding of the word of him and time but that didn't give them the new birth they still had to go to the upper room that's right amen see you say well I've got it I I it was quickened to me this message has been quickened to me amen but did receive the Holy Ghost sent you believe that's what the Apostle Paul had to say about it is amen but see then do you see want to talk about you're going down to the next one God of this evil age WR around what and did you know you were in him if you are a Christian now you was in him then and then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then for he was the fullness of the word manifested now where is there anything there that is a mortal human being involved of you and I were we in him then you better be careful because you're going to have to have some way of getting us out of him if you're going to bring us mortal and then you're going to have trouble because you're going to have to have him having an intercourse with somebody to get it the the kids out of there he said well you shouldn't talk like that that's too brother there why not somebody need to it's time to stop playing little right you know things and believe God's word that's right you said but the children here they shouldn't hear it hey they hear a whole lot more at school than I'm just said so now you blame your teacher don't blame me I'm trying to preach the gospel don't don't worry about that part of see we were in him were what what was we in him yep a part of him that's right God's children are a part of him amen amen all right look the next one number four you read it what does it comes down talking about the self-existing one and all the things he said to be a father and in him were attributes to be a savior to be a father to be God to be a father now as I said if he had attributes in him to be a father that means he had children yeah if he had in him the the fact of being a Healer that would mean he would have to shed his blood why can't we believe it then Paul on the Mars Hill he's talking to him and he said the one you're talking about I'd like to explain to you but said let me tell you one thing said even your poets will say that we are The Offspring of God and Jesus wouldn't play and when he said they said you say you're God he said what are you talking about he said they're Gods to whom the word come to right J is referring basically to the prophets but who's the word come to now to the children of God that's right see going down to the next one marriage and divorce brother R said it was in him to be a father all right to be a father so then he had to have children is in him to be a father it was in him to be God it was in him to be a son it was in him to be a savior it was in him to be a Healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes he said there's nothing that of order see all right now listen it was in him to be a father so that meant he had to have children now I've explained it over and over to you that that was God standing back there in a form called a son that's right now they didn't argue with him about saying he was a Son of God right right right they said you're a man making yourself God but they knew when he was saying that he was a Son of God are talking about the Sons and Daughters of God that they knew what he was saying that there's only one son of God and that's God himself and for us to receive eternal life makes us the children of God right called a son right but who are we God made manifest amen that's right Amen in a form called a son right and brother random said when you begin to say I and my father are one and these other things he said watch the Shu pull away right right now now where's the Shu the Shu ain't out there right shuck has got to get on here closer to us so when they start making fun of you for you saying that you're God made manifest in human flesh MH then you better believe one thing for sure they're Shu right and they'll pull away from you well because they they can't believe it see amen so watch now to be a father he must have children all right we are not the son of Jesus that was a Son of God right now brother R said Jesus now listen he didn't come to give you eternal life he come to pay the price right that you could be redeemed because eternal life would would have to be the father's life y you said well now but Jesus was almighty God right but we're not a child of Jesus that was a child of God to make you a grandchild right all right so we are the children of God because God is our father right so then in the spiritual condition of existence of taking about the New Birth then we must be God in another form and that way we can be called a son God the son is not another God cuz there's no such thing as God the son right that's right as a Son of God there's no such thing as God the son God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost no such thing it can't exist right but God made manifest in another form right that way you're not trinitarian and you're not Oneness right look at number five on your notes you see he is God Express in human form called the Son of God which the son was the mass that's trying to do God a service 1965 the son is the mask he said and if that don't make our message exactly right identified by the scripture to what he was trying to preach right right look on down look at the D ification preach in 1963 see why some man will say that he's no more than a teacher he's a philosopher he's a good man or a prophet he was Emmanuel he was the son of God listen which is God made manifest in his attributes of displaying himself in a body that he built himself right so the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily right you know the brother around said the godhead not complete without you come on you know that you know why because you're part of God Amen so everybody follow me being a part of God yes then being a part of God where God May manifest in another form called the children of God all right so now we just got a couple little quotes to throw in him Mighty God unveiled brother around I'm talking about and God in the beginning was life the Eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back and if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back too so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts now that's as blun as can be said right right prove it his word 1964 see the righteous does not die talking about the little Maiden said she was asleep Jesus came to redeem the righteous and to redeem means to be brought back from where you once was see he could not redeem the unbelievers no matter how educated and how much doctors of divinity they had he could not redeem them because they were not redeemable they had to go to their destination right message who M ches 1965 God vindicates that that's always been right God vindicates it to be true so plainly the redent shows plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that is considered in Redemption people might be making like think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestination because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right to redeem is something to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original Place hallelujah it's only the predestinated will be brought back because because the others don't come from there see bring back all right so everybody can't be redeemed why cuz it was not in that one that was standing back there they were not a part of that one that was standing back there that created the world of the full word they wasn't by not being there there wasn't in Jesus when he walked as shores of Galilee so what was in Jesus that walked ashore of Galilee he was the Living Word the alive word he said my words are spirit and their life he was the word made flesh all right and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead B that's right all right now we saw this morning that when the lamb was slain then those that were in him saw the Plan of Redemption knew it was going to take place and could rejoice you said well brother Dale we were only in his thinking amen so then we were only in his thinking and then to say we saw the lamb as it was slain then it means that we were there in some form to be able to see it if you rejoiced what was you rejoicing about right and if you was rejoicing or shouting then you had to be there in some form what was the form was in oh was the little dots can't you just see it there's little dots here and there little dots there and put that's the way the people do it you know what little dots do well there's this seed here and there's this seed there and put he was in Jesus Christ right cuz only the word becomes predestinated eternally or seed then would any problem for God to be able to look down through time and see how many people would receive eternal life you know that as far as he was concerned this thing was over with before the world ever started that's right that's what kept him now I've asked the question and I know see if I get slow I'm sorry cuz he's come to me and I have to explain it or it'll it'll take away somewhere else that's what happened in the garden in the garden when man sinned why did God not destroy him oh I know the great story yes the way that Eve was kept from being destroyed was that Adam grabbed her and had a intercourse with her now bud that's that's worth in 10th Street worse than 10th Street down Atlanta right brother Gary you know what 10th Street was the old hippie District they just lived in garbage you know that's worse than that but see what kept Adam from being destroyed come on cuz he was the one that done the wrong right because Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation world you said yeah but what God done he killed them animals amen I'm glad you're thinking but what took care of Adam and them two seconds one second whatever it was between the time they sinned until God put the animal skin on them what took care of them right one Split Second in the eyes of God and we all be destroyed without a lamb amen what was it because God was looking right back to see that he done paid the price am that's right right he done stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and the predestinated had to come forth so where is it now then what form our thought can we see that would enable us to see what the word redeem would actually mean how could we be something that can be red redeemed remember redeemed goes to back to where you came from all we covered those all right he said well where did you fall from all right now let's read what brother R let to say look at number 10 on your notes this is taken from the breach the church the seal book 1963 317 the evening message called the breach page 81 amen when a person is struck with disease aches and pain one time they wasn't that way they were grown but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong and they're groaning and trying to get back to where they was when they had help and when Nature and people as the Bible said are groaning it shows there's something that they're not in their right their they ought to to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere I'm reading number 10 on the notes well no it's maybe nine listed on yours cuz I had to change mine go down to 10 you know where it's at right below there go down to read on the breach I had to change these because me and Jo even got messed up on what message I was preaching he had me down as preaching the 15th and this evening I had it down as the 13th and so you know I I am human but you are you with me now have you found the breach got it it's right in the middle number nine should be number nine right okay so if I get my numbers off you read the next number down below all right but what is he saying now watch what he had to say about it he said they fallen from somewhere all right now this listen this is not just Adam and Eve right right all right that's what people make it to be no it's not Adam and Eve it's all mankind right all right we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see for of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature under them to death right he said we're born on the other side sold out he said of course when Adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation all right now here's a prophet making a statement and we're going to make some statements down below here that will will seemingly be total contradictory because God cannot give you eternal life and take it back that's right right he's not an Indian giver right so now what's the prophet saying well that's said interpretation now brother Dale well let's hear what you got to say about it I told you I'll tell you what I believe so then you can do what you want to about it how can you fall from eternal life so now what's brother brownon saying m what is he saying go on down the next message hear you him said but if God Saves you knowing he's going to lose you he defeats his purpose he don't do that when he saves you you're saved he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life and never come into was passion death into life turn over to the questions and answers 61 he talking about he was a prophet he had you know but God saved him and God's not an ending Giver as we call it he don't well if God give you the Holy Ghost knowing that he's going to lose you right down here why what a foolish thing it would be for him to give you the holy ghost in the first place right look at the next one 1956 god making his promise that it's a gift of God eternal life now that is if Christ has received you and if Christ gives you eternal life here and lost you down here and him being infinite knowing all things he defeats his own work he saved you when he saved you when he know he was going to lose you CU he so he doesn't do it like that now course now we got the great answer brother Dale all of those was before the seals was preached you know I like to put it out like that you know why cuz if I'm going to be a Great Deceiver I'll be a good one amen but if I can't preach both sides of the fence I tell you what you're already deceived anyway amen and there already no two sides of the fence to this message that's right it's one message all right brother Brandon what are you talking about he said no we don't need nobody to interpret it for us we know it was eternal life they had fallen from all right now brother brandham said that Adam had eternal life that's blasphemous names which is probably L of 13 on yours 14 on mine or whatever for look at you not Blasphemous names 1962 then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathe cuz that's what he's explaining like you know people believe in an eternal soul and then they breathe it's a you breathe in the Moya they call it in Africa you just breathe in and breathe out see if you did you breathe out and elephant get it you breathe in and you'd get it you breathe out and line get it you breathe in that's what he's explaining and we don't believe in it like that that's not what it is that's not eternal life right so what does he say but God specially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power of God he was an amateur God Etc now Adam then had eternal life brother brandom are you explaining that Adam fell from eternal life how could he how could that take place but what did Adam fall from there's the key right Adam was eternal in his soul right amen but he wasn't Eternal in his body and his spirit amen all right you agree amen he wasn't Eternal in his body and his Spirit but you see had he not Fallen he would become Eternal in body and spirit y true right had to fall not come into existence so what did Adam fall from becoming Eternal in body and spirit to match his soul y right what about it so he did fall from eternal life he fell from coming to the position of Body Spirit and soul as being Eternal because of sin that's what we're doing now is to come into the place that the body and spirit can be the soul is redeemed 49 of the future home waiting the Redemption of the body see then your spirit is not Eternal right your body is not Eternal now don't For Heaven's Sake don't make it anointing cuz an anointing ones would have an eternal spirit you got a problem see just don't go go that way just stay with me and listen all right the then what happened in the garden they never reached the Eternal position that God would have brought it to had there not been a fall so they fell from eternal life to what the prophet said to death did Adam lose that eternal life that he had and die if he did you may be careful he could have been sent to hell then right cuz you'd have to give it back to him somewhere right so what is the prophet saying there's no way for you and I to fall from eternal life that's right God would be defeating his own purpose but you and I are not Eternal in body and spirit we can sure flat go by the grave because of our stubbornness right and refusing to accept what God has said we have the choice of whether or not we're going to walk off this Earth in eternal life or we're going by the grave right right all right but you see he never lost Adam Adam was redeemed that's right his soul was eternal amen but when sin came into being no one else could be born that way but still God's right when he says All Souls are mine the soul that sinth shall die there's no way that it says in the Bible you to body this body that sinth shall die and it doesn't say the spirit that sinth shall die so they're not the important two parts of us it's the soul do you have eternal life it's only in your soul can't be in any other place right that's right so what's the difference between a man and an animal next quote Fellowship by Redemption animal don't have a soul right but a man has a soul and therefore that soul is a part of God now listen and even in its Fallen estate yet it's the most greatest species of all the species of the earth is the man yes just we just need to get him he said to get in connction connection with his maker am that's right all right now here's where we go because your two Soul people taught it this way that when you born into the world that God gave you a soul and the devil gave you a soul now the devil cannot create right but he did pervert the nature of your soul that's right souls in prison page 11 the nature of your soul is God if you are born again if not it is of the world I quoted that to a man and he said why Brother D you Soul just to Nature said how can nature have a nature I said go argue with the prophet you wanted the statement I gave it to you he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again the so your soul is the very part of your being that's your person that's who you are amen that's right now I'll say it and go ahead with it then the Soul is the only possibility of having the connections to Redemption right right so we can see how the soul was back there without it being our own conception we might be able to see what Redemption really is okay so let's go slow then man because of the Fall fell to death that's right he couldn't come to eternal life right so the scriptures right that when he breathed into the nostrils of Adam he became a living Soul that's right blasius 9 brother Brandon said he was a living moving human being and I've always tried to explain to you if you put a body and a spirit in a man and then you put a soul in there that wouldn't have been Adam you know if You' made it God soul so L be God that's what Jesus was but you see he was already brother around and said his feet was sticking in the earth now we'll get back to that Genesis 1: 126 and 27 cuz that's two men remember right that's right yep the eternal life has got to come from the 126 and 27 that's right y all right now we'll get back to that but the main thing I want you to do now is go with me and just just think about what said before I even read any I want you to remember one thing there has never been but one Eternal God that's right right there has never been but one eternal life right y there has never been but one Eternal Soul right amen All Souls were created and in God's mind the prophet will say I can give you the other quote on it that before the world ever begun in God's mind he saw Every Soul that would ever be on earth that's right amen and he saw who would receive eternal life and who wouldn't All Souls belong to God Satan cannot give you a soul that's right right you say it's just a nature no it's not just a nature come on it is a soul is not just a nature it's you right then you have a nature right come on if your soul is of God you got the nature of God if it's not you got the nature of the world so we all had the nature of the world and we must receive eternal life right all right so now remember there can't be but one Soul that's Eternal that's right and we're not going to go back and be redeemed any further than where I stopped this morning when I said that one man standing there that was one almighty God that was the Eternal L go the theophany the word form we had to be there well there your soul you can't have souls now we'll read it in here the prophet use word Souls but listen at it there's not but one soul that can be a part of God that's right so now let's start reading look at the message uh well we were on it right then Fellowship by Redemption 195 55 okay but man has a soul and therefore that soul is a part of God and even in its Fallen estate now what's he explaining the soul comes from God that's right soul can't come from the devil see get that out of your mind that Satan creates right he can't do it right the only thing he can create is confusion he can pervert you because that's what brother R said even those Fallen Angels do he said they'll pervert you and give you a nature those demons that fail will come and give you a nature as I said the little child raises up in the in the hospital room you know the first thing he does he blinks his eyes and he can't see too good and he hears a nurse saying so here's a full moon look at all the blanky black babies coming first thing the child hears is garbage can starts right then perverting it you can think what you want to about brother DAV and whatever you do you can train a child up in the way that it should go and you can teach it a nature oh of course now we're in the day that you're not supposed to whip children let them be what they want to be yeah look what theyve turned out to be right but you know I thank God for every whipping I ever got amen I needed a whole lot more but you see we are the ones who give our children a nature right we're the ones either used of God to bring it into a good position or we're used of the devil to bring it into a bad one either one you want to talk about that's right but brother Dale you're throwing off on me no I'm not throwing off on you I'm throwing off on what the devil's done with our minds and our ways and do it that's right that child Stomps that foot when it's about 3 years old you let it go and stomp it at 3: and at 5 it's going to kick you and beat you and do everything in the world that's right that's right but you take that little child in and you then don't whip it without talking to it sit down and explain to you what's doing and then turn around give it a little spanking it'll remember it it'll remember it that's right you mothers and daddies we formed the nature of our children so we either was a product of the devil or God one of the two you the best we can do we got a car got a problem right if we're going to call it God because we're not going to convert the child but you know what I'm saying you correct that child you let it go it's going to be its own nature that's right amen oh yeah you we're all brother Dale he loves these children but even a child wants to be corrected I didn't say they want a whiping come on kid you want to be corrected and kept straight because you find out Mom and Daddy loves you all right get off of it keep on going he said therefore that soul is a part of God see so God created Every Soul that ever would be in the world that's right right Satan cannot create right so God created that soul but he created that Soul now listen to the wording Every Soul that God ever created he had to create it perfect right I did not say Eternal there is a vast difference between Eternal and perfect but you show me where God can create anything imperfect your spirit was perfect the world is what perverted it your body is the best that he could do to make it perfect it used to be that babies were almost immune to sickness for about 6 months especially if they were breastfed babies right they were almost immune to sicknesses and things but now look we're all so perverted until poor little kid comes in the world that don't have no hoes but still God does the best he can do to bring it as perfect as he can bring right see then there's a lot of difference in it so then every soul belongs to God that's righten every soul had to come from God y God created it but just because he creates the soul don't make it eternal right Adam is the only one listed in the Old Testament that God breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul and the prophet said he become an eternal person everybody else is born in sin sa in iniquity spouse in their mother's womb went forth a liar all right their soul then is their theophany amen because Sinners have a theoy Soul right cuz the theophany is the basis of what you would call a word for a God to live in you know or a body but it's going downward right the new birth turns it to make it go upward all right eternal life right so then you don't have the listen go through the Old Testament you don't have it mentioned in a Lot About Soul now I know what now come on now so don't misunderstand I know what David said you know my soul thirsts after thee Oh God and that's right cuz what is a soul first off God created it right ever so God created it right but he didn't create him perfect right I mean Eternal excuse me created perfect right had he created Eternal then he would never needed eternal life so that's not the story that had to be a fall to bring all mankind into sin all right then that Soul coming from God was beautiful and wonderful right you know Adolf Hitler was probably a good little boy you know maybe his mom and daddy didn't apply the rod of Correction to keep him from going wrong in what he' done in life maybe they did you know he was a high Jew that's why he hated the Jews he was half Jewish s why wouldn't he been raised under the Jewish religion of knowing things evidently must not have been but listen Every Soul then comes from God right all right we got that solved Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls her mind the soul of the father or soul of the son the soul that sinth that shall die now it's you it's what you are it's you as a person it's you in the form of the fact of the way you're made so no matter where mankind is you go to the to the North Pole and you find the Indians and they're worshiping an idol you go to Africa India whatever you want to do everybody has got some kind of a God that's right they said in brother cash said in India they got 6 million Gods I think 3 million or 6 million God 3 million gods and goddesses in India alone amen it' be a good place for Paul saying on Mars Hill let me tell you about the one but everybody I don't care what you are I don't care you say I'm an atheist now you're an idiot but you can call yourself an atheist be what you want to and you can say you don't believe in God you're stupid that's right why because you got here that's right how did you care of course I know kids they talk to you come from this and come from that but where did the pow come from that's only if the sty teacher one of these days you're probably get a zero but you know when they start trying to teach you all that they say where did the pow walk come from m y well it come from this come from that I never could figure out how it got from the alligator alligator to the bird that was one I couldn't figure out but it's all right the vast jump but anyhow Every Soul come from God Satan can't give you one that's right but he perverts the nature of what you got okay so everybody with me now so every soul has to come from God so the prophet sat it that soul is a part of God what it's a creation of God yeah in a fallen estate you have a conscience part about you that you want to serve God you want to appease of God and they'll take a baby and throw it to an alligator God that they claim you know to try to appease that God right right because that conscience part of you desires to you worship and you want to do that doesn't matter what you are you want to worship all right see then doing that you're calling him your father y I'm not making no lie of of religions of the world because what if we hadn't heard it right you said well Buddha Hindu this that other oh all that's just lost gone well no brother randam according to him he said everybody be a judged according as to what they heard and what was in their life of doings and if they had never heard about Jesus Christ they would be judged according to their own laws all right that's right so now God is going not going to bring them all up you hear about Jesus get him out of here get up you didn't need no yeah no he's going to be judged according to what he done with his soul so David a man that could go out and kill his best friend take his wife away from him commit adultery but he said Lord my soul thirth after thee you know that's what God loved about him in a lost condition all right so now you everybody understand so when we start reading read these quotes you won't be tied up with well now wait a minute just just listen all right look at Jesus Christ you either got 16 or 171 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1955 808 now there's two elements just for a me few minutes on this subject there's two elements that make up the human being and one of them is your mind and and the other is your soul the mind is the is your mental thinking you're intellectual and your soul is a part of God that's in you look at that Brother D part of God sent you God's Eternal no no remember the quote before even in a fallen condition yep y keep that in mind even in a fallen condition the Fallen condition of your soul God is still the creator of the Soul let's go on next one is attitude 1950 we're going to make this second man the first man you can't see him God second man was a Halo and now he takes a third man and makes him like a little white light White Cloud coming over we can see him Holy Spirit coming down and he's all man that's the soul of man Eternal then and after this man sinned he marred that Soul amen Blackness Darkness coming to it and then God came down and lived in man suffered with man and redeemed man and the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives that Blackness and sin away from him and brings it back into perfect Fellowship a part of God Amen y so now a part of God can fall in the point of what that you're not talking about eternal life you're talking about he created it he created that soul and that Soul fell amen but then he came and gave it eternal life right now it's a part of God see what in the correct way just like they said about the theoy there's one quote around using about sinner having a theoy cuz that means a body you're going to right if you die right now you're going to a body right and that can be called a theoy but take don't use it as the word Eternal theop right don't use it that way when you get the new birth now you got Eternal the offering right in the correct order so that's what he's saying here we marred that soul that God gave us perfect yes sir amen but then when we got born again it turned the thing around amen that's it right there this is what I love about it brother Mo used to preach this years ago this is about 19 69 look at the next one Blasphemous name which is a couple of paragraphs the church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God this is right after he said Adam God readed into his nostrils and he became an eternal person now watch what he says the church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God did you get it the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathe breath into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know the Pentecostal church or the true Pentecostal church is born to the Breath of God that's what you New Birth is right God breathed in your nostrils of the the Breath of Life when you were born which made you a living soul but now you're talking about something different let me read you something just a minute just go on let me see just a minute St John I believe is where I'm going to and we'll find out whether or not that is what the church is born to the Breath of God the same day of evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut and the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you now listen and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side where then I'm reading for brother brand if you're listening were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord and Jesus and then Jesus and then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me so send I you watch the father that sent him went in him and Jesus when he sends the disciple he goes in him same as and when he had said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost Church born of the Breath of God now this was in the upper room not after the Holy Ghost had come on the day of Pentecost right so they asked brother brandham what's the difference brother brandham in then receiving on conduct order and Doctrine when he say he breathe the breath you know breathed upon he said one is a promise and the other one is happening so when he was standing there with the disciples he breathed on them and said receive you the holy ghost that didn't mean they got the Holy Ghost right uh-uh they had to go to the upper room one was a promise of the Holy Ghost coming in the upper room the other one was a coming of the Holy Ghost all right when this statur molded itself up in here God breathed breath upon them receive ye the Holy Ghost do that goes all the way into adoption then you're a Son of God you can join anything you want to but you're born into the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God breathe upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost are you listening so you can have and say my soul is a part of God sure because God created it there's a lot of difference in having the life of God and just saying God created your soul that's right well let's continue on reading we have found him and see 1953 511 if you haven't been with the mate Jesus Christ and been born of a supernatural you can't believe the Supernatural and when a man's born in of the spirit of God God's a Creator and when part of God is I'm a part of Charles brandham he's my father he look like me or I look like him rather we're about the same size and a whole lot of features because I'm an offspring of his and if I become an offspring of God In My Soul then my soul is liking something on the order of God Amen it believes the supernatural it believes for anything see what I mean believe with all things hope with all things see then if a man's ever been in contact with God and really been born again you talk to him about Divine Healing sure believes it certainly do you believe in Divine Healing sure see he's a part of God he believes anything can happen with God see he's not superstitious let's keep on reading maybe I'll get through four modern events make clear by prophecy but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was was in God before the foundation of the world right remember you that got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconcil the world himself do you believe that look he was in Christ then if you were in God a gene a word attribute from the beginning then you walk with here on with him here on Earth you talk with him on Earth you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary amen now if you have eternal life future home 1964 802 remember the Bible said if that Soul won't do as he did said do he will even destroy that soul but you see he can't destroy himself and remain God so if that soul is of the world it has to be destroyed right but if it's Eternal with God it never did begin because it's part of God and can never be destroyed so All Souls are mine and All Souls he didn't create them in the Eternal did he there's only one Soul created Eternal that's why you must die to yourself and be born again amen you must receive eternal life and to receive eternal life you receive what the very soul of almighty God right which is eternal life because there's only one soul that come from God eternally every 10 billion trillion of people's been in this world there's only one come Eternal even didn't come Eternal he had to be made Eternal but Jesus come Eternal right there wasn't a time as these brothers say he had to receive the Holy Ghost that's that's right what kind of a teaching is it but that's right there was never a time that he wasn't Eternal the body was the only thing that wasn't Eternal right okay going down works his faith Express 65 11-25 you're talking about and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it isn't so but if that Soul hasn't come from God listen it can make all impersonations out of it here but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean you're saved right that's exactly right see the spirit can be there the real genuine spirit so now what you talking about anointed ones right the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved right there's anointed ones right y it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life see it come from God and goes to God it's the soul I like that one I'd underline that and stick it in in my Bible and keep it by you because of what he just said did you read it there's only one person ever made that statement one man said one day I come from God and I go to God now if he stands here in you as a born again experience then watch what he can say it always was eternal it come from God it goes to God it's the soul that's right your soul can say that right Great Commission 1957 804 Divine Healing and salvation for the soul is not on the same basis all right do we need to explain that no we shouldn't have when you're healed physically you get sick again but the soul is the immortal part and Jesus said he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me ha that's P tense everlasting life and it shall never come to the Judgment but it's pass from Death un life that settles it but when you are born again we're a new but when we are born again we are we're a new creature and that soul is a part of God the Eternal life that comes from the Greek word from the the Greek word Zoe which means God's own life that makes us Sons and Daughters of God we can no more perish than God can perish because you're a part of him amen future home page 49 you're a part of the earth you're body your soul is a part of God it's an attribute of God displayed here on Earth in a body the body is to be redeemed now the Soul's redeemed because it was in sin so God come down by process of justification sanctification baptism with the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you're be and you being part of the earth it Redeemed by it you're in the process now it's growing on them broken sister 6513 that if I had to if I would would have know before there was a world when we were Souls AP part of God Souls a part of God it don't make all kind of running around up there does it because there's only one soul but what you saying Souls the part of God that we are for we were with him before the foundation of the world because there's only one form of eternal life and that's God and we're a part of him we was not so much that we would know and and could think and had a being but we were in his thoughts of what we were before the foundation of the world because we are a part of him like my son is a part of me and I'm part of my father and so forth we are Sons and Daughters of God by his for knowledge leadership 65207 your physical contacts to physical your spiritual contacts to spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is that Gene that come from God Amen modern events made clear by prophecy 65205 but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ this is repeat a soul of God that was in God before the foundation World remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were in in were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself you believe that he look he was in Christ then if you were in God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walk with him here on the earth you talk with him on Earth you suffered with him on the earth you died with him and you Rose again and you're communing with the word look what did he say it feeds into your soul y inter Veil 56121 you're taking reasoning and not taking Soul's conviction because your soul is the part of God that's in you that'll agree with God's word being true if not you'll just take our if not you'll just take our intellectual you think last one Faith once delivered 57 610 every spec of petroleum and moisture and what all that's in us will be taken away but we have one Blessed Assurance they never have see the world don't have this one listen they'll never be able to make a bomb that can touch that soulen ain't no earthquakes ain't no bombs ain't no doings can touch that Soul it's Immortal it's a part of God I'm so happy tonight Lord because that that is possible amen you understand let me make sure you don't understand and say it plain language we talked about this morning and brought it up to redeem to that person standing there that was the Lord Jesus Christ almighty God the word IM morphe and we had to be in him cuz that's as far as we could be redeemed now we see that soul that was what was standing there in him what soul the only one soul that ever come Eternal right you and I are a part of that Soul being made manifest so we're called Souls that's fine whatever soul that would ever come into the world God had to bring it and give it life and it become a living Soul right but to us that have received the New Birth the new birth gives eternal life to the soul makes you and God together the prophet said as persons right you say well I don't persons how else would you say it it's your soul he gave it to you all you got to do is just give it back to him and let it die now Soul's in prison he said if he can get the nature of that soul to die then it'll be born again amen that's right you say what is the New Birth when them people back there screamed out one day and said what can I do to be saved that was that Soul screaming out Peter said repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because it's eternal life right amen I believe you must receive eternal life amen I believe when you receive eternal life that eternal life makes your soul Eternal right and then we'll get back to it when we get on it the next message your soul is your theophany amen I believe that amen eternal life dwelling in you amen you said no my the is up you under that's the positive that's just like looking at the pyramid and you're born again down here at Faith but love is what's pulling you that's right so when you're born into the world and receive eternal life your soul is your theophany it starts an upward current to it pulling it but it's drawing it to the positive and if I die I just fit right over there cuz that's what the scripture says if you'll read it if question this Earthly Tabernacle were past tense see read your Bible you have one waiting right everything's waiting on us but it's the positive of God's mind that's right we're living out the negative upon earth right the partial realization a lot of people don't like negative cuz they say you make you can't make God negative brother Brown didn't have no trouble with it he seemed to understand he'd say we're the negative and we get a finish of the positive but do you understand then that soul that you are the nature of that Soul must die that's that unclean spirit that is driven out but now what are you from the time that that unclean spirit is driven out till you receive the Holy Ghost what are you don't give you the new birth cuz the unclean Spirit goes out you must receive eternal life but once you receive it eternal life always was eternal your soul is a part of God the part of God that was standing back there that said let there be one day stood on Earth and said let there be he never said thus sayeth the Lord right right come on Jesus didn't never said thus sayith the Lord he said let there be isin't it odd that brother brandham would come back to that and tell the bride that that's her position that she must come to isn't it odd that it was to brother bradam not my words but what you say Let There Be isn't it odd that your Prophet could be as a said the other day so close to God until he would come out and say because of Supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals I say unto you it's supposed to come back not thus sayith the lord it's not supposed to be just laying on the hands it's supposed to be taking what the word says and walking on do you see what a soul really is the real you right I don't care whose Soul it is I don't care how sinful it is that Soul comes from God right but then if that nature the prophet said of that Soul we can get it to die God can come in and live David had the word come on brother he had the word he had it hidden his heart brother BR said what he needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right that's what it needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that Soul Every Soul come from God but there's only one soul that come from God Eternal that's the very life and soul of almighty God and if we have that eternal life then you always was eternal that's right always was eternal voice you're going to lead to sin we got one coming here yeah but they're supposed to finish this they started it come on boys come on let's sing all right where's your guys are giving their cheers where yeah there don't put them right here yeah okay all right what are we going to sing okay let's thing ain't God good here okay all right because we finished it up with the children singing all right let's sing it A let's stand togethering unding that's what we are
