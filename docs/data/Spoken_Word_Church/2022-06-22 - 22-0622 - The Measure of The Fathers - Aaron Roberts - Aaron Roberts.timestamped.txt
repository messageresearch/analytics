[17:57] the nurture and admonition
[18:00] of the lord
[18:02] and so we'll go to matthew chapter 23
[18:05] and beginning at verse 27
[18:09] here and jesus is speaking to the
[18:11] scribes and the
[18:12] pharisees and he says woe unto you
[18:15] scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye
[18:18] are like undelighted sepulchers which
[18:22] indeed appear beautiful outward but are
[18:24] within full of
[18:26] dead men's bones and of all uncleanness
[18:30] even so ye also outwardly appear
[18:32] righteous unto men but within ye are
[18:35] full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[18:38] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[18:39] hypocrites because you build the tombs
[18:42] of the prophets and goddesses sepulchers
[18:45] of the righteousness
[18:47] and say
[18:48] if we had been in the days of our
[18:50] fathers
[18:52] we would not have been partakers with
[18:54] them in the blood of the prophets
[18:58] we know they're liars
[19:00] wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[19:02] yourselves that ye are the children of
[19:04] them which killed the prophets
[19:08] you serpents you generation of vipers
[19:10] how can you escape the damnation of hell
[19:13] wherefore
[19:14] behold i send unto you
[19:17] prophets and wise men and scribes and
[19:19] some of them you shall kill and crucify
[19:21] and some of them you shall scourge in
[19:24] your synagogues and persecute them from
[19:26] city to city that upon you may come all
[19:30] the righteous blood
[19:32] upon
[19:34] the earth from the righteous from the
[19:36] blood of righteous abel unto the blood
[19:39] of zechariah's son
[19:42] abercross
[19:43] whom ye slew between the temple
[19:46] and the altar
[19:48] verily i say unto you all these things
[19:50] shall come upon this generation amen god
[19:53] bless you tonight you may seated
[20:06] i think uh
[20:07] did i skip this verse
[20:09] i did
[20:10] i was that was what i was thinking
[20:14] because i got to look and i'm thinking i
[20:15] missed one
[20:16] hey i missed the very one that i was
[20:18] looking at
[20:19] he says where verse 31 says therefore ye
[20:23] be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are
[20:26] the children of them which
[20:27] killed the prophets fill ye up then the
[20:30] measure of your fathers
[20:33] and this is your serpent you generation
[20:34] of vipers how can you escape the nation
[20:37] of hell
[20:38] amen so god bless you um
[20:41] yeah i was
[20:42] i got to think i'm trying to figure out
[20:45] i've missed my point somewhere
[20:47] amen
[20:50] i didn't even try to go down the rabbit
[20:52] trail i guess i was going down one
[20:56] but uh
[20:57] praise the lord tonight i thought about
[21:03] the measure of the fathers and
[21:05] you know it's a
[21:07] i was reading it and it they just kind
[21:09] of stood out to me
[21:11] and uh
[21:12] you know the lord just brings
[21:14] inspiration to things in the scripture
[21:17] when you're reading it just brings
[21:18] things out but uh
[21:21] yeah i was
[21:23] thinking about father's day and
[21:26] you know
[21:27] i don't always
[21:28] like a lot of ministers we don't
[21:30] try to think about father's day or
[21:32] mother's day or christmas or or whatever
[21:35] but uh you know sometimes it just
[21:37] that's the way it comes to you and you
[21:39] just
[21:40] pick up the inspiration and
[21:42] but um i was i was thinking about this
[21:46] and thinking about father's day and
[21:48] the fathers and
[21:51] you know i appreciate the
[21:53] the men of god that
[21:54] have been placed in in my life that i've
[21:57] been associated with and
[21:59] the the the men that
[22:01] have really just been
[22:03] real real men of god real fathers
[22:07] and you know brother branham said in
[22:09] and the world is falling apart in 1963
[22:14] and and brother brown says he said how
[22:17] far they missed the the meaning of
[22:18] christmas and he's talking about the
[22:19] holidays it's become just a commercial
[22:21] act all the holidays
[22:24] have become that mother's day father's
[22:25] day and every day ought to be mother and
[22:28] father's day
[22:30] and then somebody they have christmas
[22:31] and all these things but he said every
[22:33] day ought to be
[22:35] father's day and mother's day
[22:37] you know well
[22:38] as a reason i read the scripture there
[22:42] where paul said in ephesians that we
[22:44] ought to honor our father and mother
[22:45] obey your parents in the lord for this
[22:47] is right
[22:49] you know and
[22:51] i got thinking about my dad
[22:56] i thank god for my dad
[22:58] for what he meant to me
[23:00] i was reading where brother brown was
[23:01] talking about his dad you know
[23:03] a lot of people didn't
[23:04] wouldn't have thought much highly of
[23:06] charles branham but
[23:08] he thought a lot of him
[23:10] you know he really loved his dad and he
[23:12] might not had a a great name
[23:15] but he meant a lot to brother brownham
[23:17] and
[23:18] what is what his dad done for him and
[23:20] you know i i appreciate the the men that
[23:22] that have been placed in my life and
[23:25] what has um
[23:28] the men that
[23:30] have crossed my path it's been a
[23:31] blessing to me
[23:33] and uh
[23:36] i wrote several years ago when
[23:42] i posted uh
[23:44] there were
[23:45] four men in my life that really just
[23:47] were a blessing to me that i i thought
[23:49] highly of and two of them are here
[23:51] tonight
[23:52] and uh one of them was my dad he's going
[23:54] on and i had a math teacher in high
[23:57] school and he's still alive he lives in
[23:59] north carolina and danny seaver is his
[24:02] name and
[24:03] when i
[24:04] i had a hard time
[24:06] uh growing up
[24:08] we all have we all have our
[24:11] uh
[24:12] times in life where you feel like you
[24:13] don't fit in you're you know
[24:16] you have to go through all these things
[24:17] and you you'll be surrounded by people
[24:19] and you always feel like you're on an
[24:20] island and you know we all go through
[24:22] those times of growing up it's just part
[24:24] of being an adolescent you just have to
[24:26] learn how to grow you know and and he
[24:28] really was a
[24:29] a person that really
[24:31] stood out to me that was a real blessing
[24:33] to me
[24:34] to help me out and then
[24:36] the two that are here tonight that
[24:38] really have been a blessing to me
[24:40] is brother donnie
[24:42] and pop brother dale
[24:44] and i tell you what uh i don't know what
[24:46] i'd have done with them over the years
[24:47] if it hadn't been both of them
[24:49] and
[24:51] they've been a real blessing to me
[24:56] and
[24:58] so i just want to say thank you
[25:01] and
[25:07] you know
[25:09] i look back and if i if i accomplish
[25:11] anything in this world
[25:13] if i if i'm out to anything if if i'm a
[25:16] asset to the kingdom of god
[25:18] then i can say
[25:20] that brother dale
[25:22] has you know he has a part of that
[25:24] because i wouldn't be here without him
[25:25] and i certainly wouldn't be here without
[25:27] brother donny
[25:28] and i just want to say i appreciate that
[25:30] and all your other brothers i appreciate
[25:33] each one of you and y'all been a
[25:34] blessing to me and
[25:36] you know
[25:37] and so i i want to i want to look at
[25:38] this tonight i just want to get that off
[25:40] off my heart because
[25:43] you know i'd rather give you a rose now
[25:45] than a a wreath later on
[25:49] you know i i you know i just want i just
[25:51] want to say that one thing you know i
[25:53] appreciate you
[25:56] and you know
[25:57] like brother like uh brother wade was
[25:59] talking about you know pat on the back
[26:00] sometimes
[26:01] you know i think i'd take a pat on the
[26:03] back sometimes more that would take
[26:04] money
[26:08] i you know it mean that means more to
[26:10] you
[26:11] than than a lot than a lot of other
[26:13] things you because you just can't buy
[26:15] that sometime
[26:17] you can't put a price on that but
[26:20] i i want to go back and and look at this
[26:22] this word of the measure of the fathers
[26:25] and you know
[26:26] we've all had fathers and
[26:28] um
[26:29] one one one part of this would be you
[26:31] know we have a heavenly father and and
[26:34] he and he's the one that's over all this
[26:36] and he controls all of it and then we
[26:37] have fathers in the gospel
[26:40] we have natural fathers
[26:42] we have father figures
[26:45] the scripture tells us you know always
[26:47] go back to the scripture where paul's i
[26:49] believe he's telling timothy you know he
[26:50] said entreat
[26:52] the
[26:53] older one he said rebuke not an elder
[26:55] but and treat him as a father
[26:57] and he said the older women treat his
[26:59] mother the younger ones are sisters
[27:02] and you know so we treat each other as
[27:03] brothers and sisters well you know to
[27:06] they said and to give those that are due
[27:08] double honor
[27:10] we give them higher honor
[27:12] and so you know there's there's people
[27:14] in my life that i i think of as as a
[27:16] father
[27:18] and i you know and i
[27:20] whatever i do because you know
[27:25] there's so many times in life when we
[27:27] see things that come our way and and you
[27:28] know
[27:30] we want to be we want to be
[27:34] we want to make people proud
[27:37] you know we want we want to be what you
[27:39] know that somebody can look up to and
[27:41] and these things and you know
[27:44] but many times when we go through things
[27:46] in life and things don't work out the
[27:47] way we expect them to and everything
[27:49] like it you know when you when you have
[27:51] children
[27:53] and you and you see things that go on
[27:55] you you can only lead your children so
[27:58] far
[28:00] you can only take your children
[28:02] and you know you as as the scripture
[28:04] said you know fathers don't bring your
[28:06] children to wrath but bring nurture them
[28:09] bring them up in the admonition of the
[28:11] lord
[28:12] so you know there's a there's
[28:14] as they grow you know you can you can
[28:16] only bring them so far
[28:19] i think i think about brother dale
[28:20] always talking about josh being little
[28:22] and you know getting close to the wood
[28:24] stove and you know you just tell him hot
[28:27] hot you know well you know what you can
[28:28] only tell them that much so many times
[28:32] you know it's just like you know
[28:34] the boys you know when they were growing
[28:36] up you can only tell them so many times
[28:38] about something but then you know what
[28:40] you got to let them do it
[28:42] themselves it's like don't stick that in
[28:45] the in the light socket don't stick that
[28:47] in the wall
[28:48] well here you know what if you want to
[28:50] stick this clothes pin or this paper
[28:52] clip in there just go ahead
[28:55] well you can tell them not to do that
[28:58] but you know what they're still going to
[29:00] do it
[29:02] why because they'll get to the point
[29:03] where i'm going to find out
[29:06] and so many times in life you know
[29:09] we have children and you can only go so
[29:11] far to do what you can for them
[29:14] but you know what that doesn't never
[29:16] whatever they do you know it doesn't
[29:18] change the love that you have for your
[29:20] children
[29:22] and you know and so you see you know
[29:24] they they disappoint you
[29:27] and no doubt you disappoint them
[29:31] they they they know how brother brown
[29:33] said you know they walk on your feet one
[29:34] day and the next time they walk on your
[29:36] heart
[29:38] but you know what you never you never
[29:39] lose that love for them
[29:43] now you don't agree with the way they
[29:44] act
[29:45] you don't condone their actions you
[29:47] don't condem you don't condone the
[29:49] things that they say
[29:51] but it doesn't change who they are
[29:54] and if and if so much more that that we
[29:58] do that for our children how much more
[30:00] does our heavenly father
[30:03] love us
[30:04] for what he's done for
[30:06] us and where we came from and then where
[30:10] we've come to today what god has done
[30:12] for us that he loves us
[30:15] and if we see if we as as he was jesus
[30:17] was speaking he said you know if if you
[30:19] have a son and he asks for bread or if
[30:22] he asked for you know uh for a fish
[30:26] he said he said would you give him a
[30:27] stone
[30:29] or would you give him a serpent
[30:31] and he said he said ye being evil know
[30:33] how to give good gifts to your children
[30:38] he said how much more will your heavenly
[30:39] father give unto you that ask
[30:43] and one place he actually says how much
[30:45] more will he give you the holy ghost to
[30:47] them that
[30:48] ask so
[30:50] all the things that we have that we have
[30:52] that we desire everything that we have a
[30:55] need for that he's already given to us
[30:58] it's already our possession but the
[31:01] problem is is do we claim what god has
[31:03] given us
[31:05] because we'll we allow the devil to get
[31:07] in our way and he'll stand there and and
[31:09] we can we'll take condemnation when he
[31:12] tries to tell us that you know what he
[31:14] doesn't remember the things of the past
[31:17] when he tries to tell us all of these
[31:19] things are in the sea of god's
[31:20] forgetfulness well praise god we serve a
[31:23] god that is so great he can forget
[31:26] when we can't forget when we can't
[31:28] forgive ourselves here's one that will
[31:31] lead us to the place to show that we can
[31:33] forgive ourselves because there's a
[31:35] there's a process that we can overcome
[31:38] these things and take them out of our
[31:39] mind
[31:41] so we can overcome our stinking thinking
[31:46] so all of these things are such a
[31:48] blessing to us that what god has has
[31:51] called us in this hour what god has
[31:53] called us
[31:54] to
[31:55] how blessed we are
[32:00] and so to see
[32:03] now here in in matthew when jesus is
[32:06] speaking to the to the pharisees the
[32:08] scribes and the pharisees you know it's
[32:10] so it's so amazing and and
[32:12] we're going to get lord when we'll try
[32:15] to get
[32:15] into some other scriptures later on but
[32:17] i i want to i want to show you this
[32:20] this here in the scripture because
[32:23] when you look at what jesus is speaking
[32:25] to the
[32:26] pharisees the scribes and the pharisees
[32:28] and what they were doing and here they
[32:30] are talking
[32:32] now can you imagine
[32:34] here these men are
[32:36] well
[32:37] renowned men have to have these great
[32:40] educations all of this scholarship and
[32:43] all of the great things that they have
[32:45] and here they are these men standing out
[32:47] here looking at these great uh
[32:49] sepulchers these great monuments that
[32:52] are built to people and uh sepulchers
[32:54] these great monuments that are built to
[32:56] people and here they are standing here
[32:58] in front of all of these people in here
[33:00] and here they are talking about the
[33:02] great things that god done in the past
[33:05] here they are standing there polishing
[33:07] these great these great monuments to
[33:09] these great people oh isaiah and ezekiel
[33:11] killing all these great men and talking
[33:13] about what god done and what god said
[33:15] all the great things that took place in
[33:17] the past
[33:19] but you know here they are talking about
[33:21] their fathers were the one that killed
[33:23] them and they were out there saying well
[33:24] you know what
[33:27] if i was there
[33:29] i wouldn't have done that
[33:33] i wouldn't have never done that
[33:36] now now my father's our our ancestors
[33:39] now they killed them they rejected the
[33:41] word and they killed the killed the
[33:43] prophets and the righteous and put them
[33:46] in the graves but we wouldn't have done
[33:47] that
[33:49] here we are we're standing here looking
[33:50] at all these great things talking about
[33:52] it and saying they're talking to jesus
[33:54] and jesus is speaking to them and
[33:56] telling them that you're hypocrites
[33:58] you're a generation of vipers why
[34:01] because you've done the exact same thing
[34:03] that they done
[34:05] because the first thing that they done
[34:06] was reject the word and here they're
[34:09] standing in front of the scribes and
[34:10] pharisees and he's saying listen he said
[34:12] y'all done the exact same thing you have
[34:14] rejected the word
[34:16] jesus is standing there in front of him
[34:18] and tell him it searched the scriptures
[34:20] and see that if if i don't fulfill every
[34:22] single word
[34:24] he said in them you say that you have
[34:26] eternal life
[34:28] he said but they testify of me
[34:31] but you've rejected what i've said when
[34:34] he pointed out in the scripture
[34:38] now here's now here is this foundation
[34:40] that has been laid because they're
[34:41] speaking and then jesus says see your
[34:44] own testimony your own witness says that
[34:46] you're the sons of those men
[34:51] and and and so and really in two ways he
[34:54] brings it out number one he brings out
[34:56] the fact that they are the the physical
[34:59] children
[35:01] the lineage of those men but he's also
[35:04] bringing out the fact that they are also
[35:05] the spiritual lineage of the devil
[35:09] because they are the father that's their
[35:11] father and he said they're the son and
[35:13] he said you're doing a generation of
[35:14] vipers he said you're fulfilling exactly
[35:17] what jesus what the devil done
[35:19] what satan done he was a rejecter of the
[35:21] word
[35:23] and what did he do when they rejected
[35:24] the word they killed him
[35:26] exactly what he done what they done from
[35:28] the beginning what did kang do cain
[35:30] started in the beginning and when he
[35:32] would not accept the word when he would
[35:34] not change his way why would he made him
[35:36] a murderer
[35:38] well because if you can't deny the word
[35:40] if you can't get rid of the word then
[35:41] what are you going to do how do you get
[35:42] rid of the effect of the word is you get
[35:44] rid of the people
[35:47] then what did brother ram say in the
[35:49] church age book how does how does he
[35:50] going to destroy
[35:52] trying to destroy the bride is by decree
[35:54] discrediting the word of god and then
[35:56] he's trying to destroy the people of god
[36:00] what is was every gun against the bride
[36:02] why because he's trying to discredit the
[36:04] word
[36:06] so that's this whole thing is trying to
[36:07] destroy every effect of it
[36:13] but here they are
[36:15] speaking of these things and he said
[36:17] yeah but he said when you look back
[36:20] when you look back in the and see what
[36:22] your fathers have done what your
[36:23] ancestors have done and you realize hey
[36:26] they've done that and those men were
[36:28] righteous because the word that the
[36:30] prophets because the word of the lord
[36:32] that came to the prophets came to pass
[36:34] so when it came to pass then you know
[36:36] what your fathers were
[36:39] they were liars and hypocrites
[36:42] and you could see how they were fought
[36:43] they were the children of the devil
[36:46] and when they've done all these things
[36:48] then when he turns around and says you
[36:49] see what they've done and here you are
[36:51] doing the exact same thing he said
[36:53] you're worthy of greater damnation than
[36:55] they are
[36:57] why because when you look back and you
[36:58] see what has taken place and you don't
[37:01] walk in it then to them that's iniquity
[37:04] he said you're you're you're children of
[37:07] hypocrisy and iniquity why because
[37:09] you've not walked in what you've seen
[37:11] because your own testimony is what holds
[37:13] you
[37:14] it's what binds you you're held by your
[37:16] own testimony
[37:19] and he says see then then he says then
[37:22] he tells them he said well then fill ye
[37:24] up the measure
[37:26] of your fathers
[37:28] so what is he saying the the the
[37:34] the doctrine the actions
[37:38] the legacy
[37:40] of your fathers
[37:43] whatever has come in the past
[37:45] whatever they've done
[37:47] that's the measure that's come and he
[37:49] said all of that that took place in the
[37:51] past he said then you fill up
[37:54] or what or if you if you look at other
[37:56] translations of it it says you fulfill
[37:59] the let the measure or the height
[38:03] the level
[38:05] that your father said
[38:08] so what your fathers have set as a goal
[38:12] as a as a as a uh
[38:16] try to think of a of a good uh as as a
[38:19] as a legacy or a level a a hike that
[38:22] they've set then that's what you're
[38:24] coming to he said so go ahead because
[38:26] you know what you walk in the fullness
[38:28] of what your fathers have done he said
[38:31] then go ahead and fulfill it come into
[38:33] the fullness of that
[38:35] because that's your legacy because
[38:37] that's what you believe then go ahead
[38:39] and do it all the way to its fullness
[38:41] walk in the fullness of that and
[38:43] manifest exactly what you are
[38:48] and so if he's calling them to do that
[38:50] all bring that all the way to a fullness
[38:52] bring it all the way to completion bring
[38:54] it up you know don't don't do it halfway
[38:56] don't don't just hold back but just do
[38:58] every bit of it bring it to a fullness
[39:02] then then when we look at this then be
[39:04] he said full up
[39:06] fill up the measure
[39:08] of your fathers
[39:11] so
[39:12] as we see that that later on we'll look
[39:15] a little more at that but to understand
[39:17] that whatever you have your fathers have
[39:20] brought
[39:22] then that is what we should fill up
[39:24] that's what we should manifest
[39:28] so when we look at this you know because
[39:31] it becomes it it's a
[39:34] several different things to look at
[39:35] tonight but you know one of the things
[39:36] we look at just in the natural
[39:39] you know the the
[39:41] legacy or the the way that you bring
[39:43] your children up the scripture says you
[39:45] know bring them up in the admonition of
[39:47] god he said train up a child in the way
[39:49] it should go he said when it's old it
[39:50] won't depart from it well you know
[39:52] brother branham said he said the problem
[39:54] is he said it's not children delinquent
[39:56] it's not juvenile delinquency he said
[39:57] his parent delinquency so what is the
[39:59] problem he said the problem is is the
[40:02] parents have not brought the children to
[40:03] the place but he says now bring your
[40:05] children to the place that you've that
[40:07] you've laid out for your fathers have
[40:09] laid this out and that's where you
[40:10] should go
[40:15] see it
[40:16] it's so important
[40:19] you know to hold to hold the standard in
[40:21] front of your children because they they
[40:24] have you know because they can find all
[40:25] kinds of friends in the world that you
[40:27] know that have all kinds of ideas and
[40:30] and worldly spirits and all kinds of
[40:31] stuff but you know they need to have
[40:33] somebody that they can look at
[40:35] and not just not just parents but you
[40:36] know everyone in the church
[40:38] i i was thinking about where brother
[40:40] dale went when he goes to dedicate
[40:41] babies and you know it's like listen we
[40:43] dedicate all of us
[40:46] why because we are all charged with one
[40:48] thing and that's living a life in front
[40:50] of that child that they see jesus christ
[40:53] it's not just the parents but you know
[40:54] what if we come to this church and we
[40:56] and we claim that we claim the name of
[40:58] jesus christ to be christians then we
[41:00] ought to live a life that that is
[41:01] pleasing to the lord that is above
[41:03] reproach
[41:06] you know that is that is that is my goal
[41:09] and you know i i fall short of that i
[41:11] know that but you know that's still my
[41:12] goal i still my desire to come to that
[41:14] place
[41:16] i still have a goal that i'm still
[41:18] trying to reach but you know what i'm
[41:19] not giving up
[41:21] but you know i still want i still want
[41:22] people to see jesus christ
[41:25] i still want as the song always talks
[41:27] about
[41:28] i love that song and
[41:30] one of these days maybe i'll sing it but
[41:33] you know it the words are
[41:35] when they looked they beheld him when i
[41:38] spoke they could hear him
[41:40] when i walked
[41:41] my every footstep led them all to
[41:43] calvary
[41:45] he said let others have worldly fame but
[41:48] when someone speaks his name
[41:51] let them recall they first saw him and
[41:53] me
[41:56] i want i want the world to know which
[41:58] side that i'm on
[41:59] i don't want i don't want there to be
[42:01] any kind of ambiguity or anything like
[42:02] that where somebody gets confused i want
[42:04] them to know which side that i'm on
[42:07] i want somebody when they look at me
[42:08] that they know this is a christian
[42:10] not somebody just playing games or
[42:12] playing church or just looking or trying
[42:14] to act apart i want somebody know that
[42:16] this is this is a real born-again son of
[42:18] god that has that has come under a
[42:20] crimson flow and has been changed by the
[42:23] holy ghost that the word in me has
[42:25] changed me into his image that they can
[42:28] see what takes place when when you come
[42:30] through the calvary what happens to a
[42:33] man what happens to a woman when you
[42:34] come through calvary and they can look
[42:36] and say that's that's a christian
[42:40] that's what i swear that's what my goal
[42:42] is
[42:46] not just
[42:47] not just play church
[42:50] let's be the bride
[42:54] now
[42:57] this is uh
[42:59] jeremiah
[43:01] 31
[43:03] and
[43:05] beginning at verse 27
[43:07] to bring that up
[43:09] jeremiah says behold the days come saith
[43:12] the lord that i will sow
[43:14] the house of israel and the house of
[43:16] judah with the seed of men and with the
[43:18] seed of beast and it shall come to pass
[43:22] excuse me that like
[43:23] as i have watched over them to pluck up
[43:27] to break down to throw down and to
[43:29] destroy and to afflict
[43:31] so will i watch over them to build and
[43:33] to plant saith the lord in those days
[43:36] they shall
[43:37] say no more the fathers have eaten a
[43:39] sour grape and the children's teeth are
[43:42] set on edge
[43:43] but every one shall die for his own
[43:46] iniquity every man that eateth the sour
[43:48] grape his teeth shall be set on edge
[43:50] behold the days come saith the lord that
[43:53] i will make a new covenant with the
[43:54] house of israel and with the house of
[43:56] judah not according to the covenant that
[43:58] i made with their fathers in the day
[44:00] that i took them by the hand to bring
[44:01] them out of the land of egypt which my
[44:03] covenant they break although i was an
[44:06] husband unto them saith the lord but
[44:08] this shall be the covenant that i will
[44:10] make with the house of israel after
[44:12] those days saith the lord i will put my
[44:14] law in their inward parts and right in
[44:16] their hearts and i will and will be
[44:18] their god and they shall be my people
[44:20] and they shall teach no more every man
[44:22] his neighbor and every man his brother
[44:25] saying know the lord for they shall all
[44:28] know me
[44:29] from the least of them unto the greatest
[44:31] of them saith the lord and i will
[44:33] forgive their iniquity and remember
[44:35] their sin no more
[44:37] amen so when we go here jeremiah's
[44:40] speaking to
[44:42] the the children
[44:44] and we know that
[44:45] jeremiah was a
[44:48] um
[44:50] captivity
[44:53] um when they went into captivity was one
[44:55] of the prophets there and and you know
[44:58] when when he began to speak to him as
[45:00] they had went in
[45:02] and you know
[45:03] he began to tell them what was going to
[45:05] take place and here they they go in when
[45:08] uh babylon takes over and and all that
[45:11] when when they go in
[45:12] you know the the children when they come
[45:14] up from under all of this and they see
[45:17] all these things you know the children
[45:18] are the ones they blame their parents
[45:20] for this
[45:22] and the scripture says you know that he
[45:24] said the fathers have eaten a sour grape
[45:27] and the children's teeth are set on edge
[45:29] meaning meaning that
[45:31] that that the fathers committed a
[45:33] committed a sin
[45:36] and now now the children are paying for
[45:38] it
[45:39] they're in they're in captivity because
[45:41] of what their fathers have done
[45:44] and so here they are you know they're
[45:46] they're talking about these things but
[45:48] here's here's god's speaking through
[45:50] jeremiah tell them he said now listen
[45:52] hey you blame you blame your parents for
[45:54] where you're at
[45:56] but then he said listen he said i'm
[45:57] going to there's coming a day when i'm
[45:59] going to speak and put my law in your
[46:01] hearts and i'm going to speak to you and
[46:04] take you and you're going to be my
[46:05] people
[46:06] why because they were already his people
[46:09] but what had happened is they came out
[46:10] from underneath it
[46:13] but when you when you see when when
[46:14] jeremiah begins to rebuke the children
[46:16] of israel for their condition when where
[46:18] they're at and what was going on the
[46:20] problem was they're looking back and
[46:22] they're complaining about what the
[46:23] fathers have done and jeremiah comes on
[46:26] the scene and he begins to tell them
[46:28] your problem is not what your fathers
[46:30] have done that's where you're at right
[46:31] now because of what your father's done
[46:33] the reason you can't come out is because
[46:35] you're still holding on to the doctrines
[46:38] and the things that your father's held
[46:40] on to and that's what's holding you back
[46:42] in captivity is because you're still
[46:44] down there doing the exact same things
[46:46] the same idol worship and all the same
[46:48] things that your your father's done
[46:51] they're in the same condition and so you
[46:54] know many people they want to try to
[46:55] find somebody why why they're into why
[46:58] they're in the condition they are today
[47:00] just like brother branham said we can't
[47:02] blame adam and eve for our problems we
[47:04] know that the fall happened because of
[47:06] what they done but you know what today
[47:08] is not we can't just turn around and say
[47:09] well you know what i don't have to do
[47:11] nothing because we're just going to
[47:12] blame adam and eve for it
[47:15] well it's not adam and eve's fault
[47:17] anymore
[47:18] why because you know what there come a
[47:20] day that you and i we both came to a
[47:22] an age of accountability
[47:24] and we had to we had to take
[47:25] accountability for ourselves we're now
[47:27] accountable for what we do
[47:34] has
[47:36] as a man said one time that he said it's
[47:39] it's not it's not bad
[47:41] to be in he's
[47:43] wrong and be in these places
[47:45] he said the problem is a stay in there
[47:49] people people go well i i'm just this
[47:51] way i'm just like no you there's a way
[47:53] out
[47:58] we were all born in sin shaping iniquity
[48:01] we all come into this world speaking
[48:03] lives we're all children of wrath even
[48:06] as others
[48:08] what he say ye have who he has quickened
[48:11] who were dead and sin and trespasses
[48:15] and we're by nature the children of
[48:17] wrath even as others
[48:19] but god rich in mercy
[48:22] god has made a way for us so we can look
[48:24] back well you know we come this way but
[48:26] you know what we don't have to stay this
[48:27] way
[48:29] but the problem is is people just want
[48:30] to sit down he's like well i i just have
[48:33] i just have this
[48:35] well you know what
[48:36] it's not that
[48:38] god hasn't made a way
[48:39] to get out from underneath that
[48:43] you know it's just like going to the
[48:44] doctor and you know er you know you have
[48:46] some kind of ailment or some kind of
[48:49] problem or whatever and you know
[48:52] what whatever the issue is and you don't
[48:54] follow the doctor's directions
[48:59] i i knew i knew a young man when when he
[49:02] was about my age now but when he when he
[49:04] was baby he had had problems with his
[49:06] feet he had club feet and all these
[49:07] things and and they had to had to do
[49:09] surgery to fix his feet where he could
[49:11] walk and and they had to do both of his
[49:14] feet and work on them and everything and
[49:15] you know there came a time where you
[49:17] know his parents when they told him
[49:19] after he had the surgery you know they
[49:20] had to do physical therapy on him
[49:24] and there was a lot of stretching and
[49:26] massaging and all these things that they
[49:28] had to do with him and it was just a
[49:31] long process you know it's not going to
[49:32] fix it overnight but this is what you've
[49:34] got to stay on top of
[49:37] you've got to do this on a regular basis
[49:39] you've got to be faithful to taking care
[49:41] of this problem
[49:43] and the problem was is when he got when
[49:45] he started growing well you know what he
[49:47] just cried too much
[49:49] well you know what ain't nobody gonna
[49:51] gonna be wanting to do that
[49:54] when you when you operate on their
[49:55] ankles and you and you do all those
[49:57] things and then you turn around it's
[49:58] like well we got to massage those feet
[49:59] we got to stretch all those things to
[50:01] get their feet lined up
[50:04] well you know you walk around with your
[50:05] feet turned in all the time well you
[50:07] know when he grew up he still had
[50:08] problems with his feet why because his
[50:10] parents didn't do what was what the
[50:12] doctor told him to do
[50:14] and you know the problem is when he grew
[50:16] up and as he got older you know he had
[50:17] more problems that he had to work on
[50:19] taking care of himself why because his
[50:21] parents didn't take care of it
[50:23] and brothers and sisters it's the same
[50:25] way when we have children you've got to
[50:27] bring them up and you've got to put them
[50:28] on the right path and you've got to fix
[50:30] them and hold them up and get them ready
[50:31] where they can walk because you know
[50:33] what it ain't going to be pleasing to
[50:34] you and it ain't going to be pleasing to
[50:35] them but you've got to make sure that
[50:37] they get on the right path that they can
[50:39] stand on their own two feet
[50:41] whatever it is you've got to get them
[50:43] ready that they can do these things
[50:46] why because it's like well we just want
[50:48] to pray the lord let the lord take it
[50:49] well god gave you sins and he gave you
[50:52] time and he gave you the effort he gave
[50:54] you the intelligence to do it yourself
[50:56] and he gave you the holy ghost and he
[50:58] gave you the word well then you know
[50:59] what it's something that you've got to
[51:00] do
[51:01] you've got to do it for yourself
[51:08] you know what we just we can we can pray
[51:10] and for for the holy ghost to fall but
[51:12] you know what you've got to be there
[51:13] holy ghost you've got to be the one
[51:15] that's got a lot to
[51:16] raise them up and stand between them and
[51:19] the devil in the world and hold hold
[51:21] things back and you've got to be the one
[51:22] to set an example and you've got to set
[51:24] a standard and you've got to resist the
[51:26] devil getting into your home
[51:30] all those things because you know what
[51:32] you can stand there and you can tell
[51:33] them oh what are right and wrong but you
[51:35] know what they've got to stand up one of
[51:36] these days is take a take account for
[51:38] themselves
[51:47] we see we see kids and
[51:50] you know they get out and
[51:52] every you know
[51:53] every little thing that comes along is
[51:55] shiny and flashy this worldly you know
[51:58] kids are attracted to it young people
[51:59] are attracted to it
[52:01] well i should say everybody's attracted
[52:03] to it you know as long as as long as
[52:05] you're in this world you still got
[52:06] something you know there's things in the
[52:07] world that still draws you and turns
[52:09] your eyes
[52:13] no i'm superman nothing phases me
[52:17] i don't i don't know who you come from
[52:18] but
[52:19] you you walk in the the
[52:22] christian walk a lot of the rest of us
[52:24] are walking
[52:26] because you know what it's a battle
[52:28] every day
[52:31] but you see these things they they draw
[52:32] kids attentions they got young people's
[52:34] attention they're trying to well you got
[52:36] to stand between all that
[52:39] you got to be the one to break all that
[52:41] all that silliness
[52:44] the world's full of it
[52:47] and everything you try to try to bring
[52:49] your children up a certain way well you
[52:50] know the thing is is when children get
[52:53] you tell them and you try to set
[52:55] examples and you and you try to set
[52:57] things
[52:58] a standard and and all kinds of things
[53:00] well you know
[53:01] and and the situ in the world that we
[53:03] live in today the situation that we live
[53:04] in today there's lots of kids that are
[53:06] out there and they all got cell phones
[53:09] they got little mini computers
[53:14] and you see you know i mean it got so
[53:16] bad at our plan well they had to put
[53:18] signs up saying you know don't walk in
[53:19] this way looking at your com your
[53:22] phone
[53:25] because peop we got forklifts and people
[53:27] are looking at it like this and
[53:29] don't even know where they're tripping
[53:30] over stuff because they can't get out of
[53:32] their cell phone long enough
[53:36] and some of them some of them are the
[53:38] ones that the companies actually paid
[53:39] for
[53:41] they give them the supervisors and they
[53:42] still can't walk around without running
[53:43] into stuff
[53:46] but you see these kids you know they get
[53:48] on these things and you know you tell
[53:49] them listen and you try to set
[53:51] parameters and everything like that and
[53:53] you
[53:55] kids aren't kids aren't above being
[53:57] tempted
[53:59] and you see these kids and they got
[54:00] these little uh
[54:02] apps and um
[54:05] software and all kinds of stuff well you
[54:06] know what there's kids that sit and spit
[54:08] all day long and they're trying to hack
[54:11] software they're trying to get passwords
[54:13] so they can get past the
[54:16] the
[54:16] firewall or whatever they got set up on
[54:19] their phones because they're trying to
[54:20] get in there so they can get to the good
[54:22] stuff they spent all our time trying to
[54:25] get everybody you know because you're
[54:26] trying to keep them from stuff and it's
[54:28] like well you don't need to be on on
[54:30] all this tick tock and everything else
[54:32] and then you know they get on youtube
[54:34] and everything like that and then you
[54:35] know you you can try to lay out a
[54:38] a plan and you you try to tell them what
[54:41] the scripture says well the first thing
[54:42] you do they brother madam says if you
[54:44] don't get your children to christ he
[54:47] said if you don't get them to god he
[54:48] said rock and roll's going to get them
[54:52] you know what that's every kind of
[54:53] garbage music that's out there
[54:56] that's what rock and roll is
[54:59] and people people say well i don't i
[55:01] don't i don't know about that
[55:03] what do you mean by rock and roll
[55:05] well let me let me give you an example
[55:08] if you go to um and you don't have to
[55:11] but you can take my word for it if not
[55:13] you can look it up but i i promise you
[55:14] this is this is true
[55:16] you go to the rock and roll hall of fame
[55:20] and you look up and see and you know
[55:21] what and they put people in there from
[55:23] every genre of music in the rock and
[55:25] roll hall of fame
[55:28] there's rap artists there's country
[55:30] artists
[55:31] everybody that you can think of that's
[55:32] music and you know why because every one
[55:35] of them and they'll tell you every one
[55:37] of them is an influence in what rock and
[55:40] roll becomes
[55:42] so when you put in all these even when
[55:45] you put in christian artists and all
[55:46] this stuff when you put all these ones
[55:48] in the rock and roll hall of fame then
[55:50] don't tell me that rap music ain't part
[55:52] of that one brother said rock and roll
[55:54] don't tell me that rap music don't fall
[55:55] into it don't tell me that country don't
[55:57] fall into that don't tell me all this
[55:58] other stuff that goes don't fall into
[56:00] that same category if they're if they're
[56:02] putting it in the hall of fame
[56:05] it's the same thing so you know what if
[56:07] you don't get your children to christ if
[56:09] you don't get them to the right place
[56:10] and what do they do they're going to be
[56:11] feeding on that
[56:14] and you can you can do whatever you want
[56:16] to and and live the best kind of life
[56:18] and and do whatever around your mom and
[56:20] daddy and all this kind but god knows
[56:21] where you're at god knows what you do
[56:23] god knows what you listen to god knows
[56:25] what you read god knows what you're
[56:27] watching
[56:31] you can feed your mind on foolishness if
[56:33] you want to you can feel you feel your
[56:34] mind full of garbage but you know what
[56:36] you can't feed on that on a continuous
[56:39] basis on a continual basis and feed on
[56:42] garbage and have anything but have
[56:44] garbage come out
[56:46] whatever you sow whatever seed whatever
[56:48] kind of seed you're sowing is what
[56:50] you're going to reap whatever you see on
[56:52] the
[56:53] cakes on the inside whatever you're
[56:55] feeding whatever you're living on is
[56:56] what's going to be manifested you're not
[56:58] going to get away from it
[57:07] but they feed on that stuff all the time
[57:10] and they oh man this is so good it's so
[57:12] good
[57:13] and they they
[57:15] oh they
[57:16] they they love trying to get people they
[57:19] so they love that that excitement that
[57:21] comes when hey mama don't know this and
[57:23] daddy don't know this so we're sneaking
[57:25] around and
[57:26] god knows
[57:29] and just remember every time you open
[57:30] open that stuff up and you get in there
[57:32] and you're and you spend hours and hours
[57:35] and hours listening to whatever
[57:39] you just you just put it in there
[57:41] your christian rock whatever you want to
[57:43] put your label
[57:46] oh so well it's only it's only such and
[57:48] such you know it's only this it's only
[57:50] that you know listen
[57:52] if it's not pleasing to the lord
[57:55] you know what brother branham said
[57:56] brother man said there is no such thing
[57:58] as a white black bird
[58:00] there ain't no such thing as a drunk
[58:01] sober man
[58:04] and there ain't no such thing as
[58:05] something that's of the devil that's
[58:07] pleasing to the lord
[58:11] you're not you're not going you're not
[58:13] going to have that
[58:16] well that's that's free tonight
[58:23] but just remember
[58:25] you'll give an account for it
[58:29] some some men's go before them some
[58:32] men's sins go after
[58:35] we all give account for it
[58:40] ezekiel this is ezekiel
[58:43] 18 and
[58:45] i've i put the whole chapter on here but
[58:47] i promise you i'm not going to read the
[58:49] whole chapter but that is that is the
[58:50] whole chapter but i just want to read a
[58:53] few scriptures here
[58:55] ezekiel 18 verse 1 says and the word of
[58:58] the lord came unto me saying
[59:00] came unto me again saying what mean ye
[59:03] that you use this parable this proverb
[59:05] concerning the land of israel saying the
[59:07] fathers have eaten sour grapes and the
[59:09] children's teeth are set on edge as i
[59:11] live saith the lord god ye shall not
[59:14] have occasion any more to use this
[59:16] proverb in israel
[59:18] he said behold all souls are mine as the
[59:21] soul of the father so also the soul of
[59:23] the son is mine
[59:25] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[59:28] he said but if a man be just and do that
[59:31] which is lawful and right and have not
[59:32] eaten from the mountains neither have
[59:34] lifted up his eyes to the idols of the
[59:36] house of israel neither hath defiled his
[59:39] neighbor's wife
[59:41] neither has come near to a mistress
[59:43] woman and hath not oppressed any but
[59:46] have
[59:47] restored to the dead or his pledge has
[59:50] spoiled none by his by violence hath
[59:53] given his bread to the hungry and hath
[59:55] covered the nakedness with a garment
[59:58] he that hath not given forth upon usury
[1:00:02] neither to have taken any increase that
[1:00:05] hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity
[1:00:08] have executed true judgment between man
[1:00:11] and man hath walked in my statutes and
[1:00:14] hath kept my judgments to deal truly he
[1:00:16] is just he shall surely live saith the
[1:00:20] lord god
[1:00:22] so we say when when he begins to speak
[1:00:24] of all this as jeremiah was speaking
[1:00:28] that you know they were saying this is
[1:00:29] this is a hard
[1:00:31] hard thing that
[1:00:32] because he's saying we're we're we're
[1:00:35] under we're under this problem that our
[1:00:37] fathers created and we're so we're bound
[1:00:40] by this and we're still under this but
[1:00:42] then when he comes ezekiel comes to him
[1:00:44] and says listen
[1:00:45] you're never going to have this issue
[1:00:47] again
[1:00:48] because i'm coming to lay out the word
[1:00:51] to you that you can't blame the ones in
[1:00:53] the past
[1:00:55] you can't when ezekiel began to tell him
[1:00:57] listen this is a statue that i'm going
[1:00:59] to give you
[1:01:00] just like jeremiah was telling them he
[1:01:02] said listen this is this is the way this
[1:01:04] is going to be it's it's laid out now
[1:01:06] you can't blame them in the past because
[1:01:08] it's going to be laid out before you
[1:01:10] that you've got to learn how to walk
[1:01:13] you've got you've got to do these things
[1:01:15] and so he lays out all as he tells them
[1:01:17] all these are things that you've got to
[1:01:18] do you've got to walk in my statutes and
[1:01:20] you've done none of these things and he
[1:01:22] said you shall live
[1:01:25] but as we continue on
[1:01:28] so we see these things that what that
[1:01:30] they had to do
[1:01:32] in verse 14
[1:01:34] when he begins to talk about the men
[1:01:36] that have done all these things
[1:01:39] and that having a son he says now lo if
[1:01:42] he beget a son that seeth all his
[1:01:44] father's sins which he hath done and
[1:01:46] considereth and doeth not such
[1:01:50] like
[1:01:52] he said that have not eaten upon the
[1:01:54] mountains
[1:01:56] and if you if you don't know what that
[1:01:58] is that's where you
[1:01:59] when they were sacrificing and eating
[1:02:01] unto idols they were in the mountains
[1:02:04] so that's what they were doing that's
[1:02:05] where they had their revelry and
[1:02:08] and their and their parties and and such
[1:02:10] neither have lifted up his eyes to the
[1:02:12] idols of the house of israel have not
[1:02:14] defiled his
[1:02:15] neighbor's wife neither have the pressed
[1:02:17] any
[1:02:18] hath not withheld the pledge neither
[1:02:20] have spoiled by violence but have given
[1:02:22] his bread to the hungry and has covered
[1:02:24] the naked with a garment
[1:02:26] that hath taken off his hand from the
[1:02:28] poor and hath not received usury
[1:02:30] usury nor increase hath executed my
[1:02:33] judgments hath walked in his statutes he
[1:02:35] shall not die for the iniquity of his
[1:02:37] father he shall surely live
[1:02:39] for as his father because he truly
[1:02:41] oppressed spoiled his brother by
[1:02:43] violence and that that which is not good
[1:02:46] among his people lo even he shall die in
[1:02:49] his iniquity
[1:02:51] yet say ye why doth not the son bear the
[1:02:53] iniquity of the father when the son hath
[1:02:56] done that which is lawful and right and
[1:02:58] hath kept all his statutes and hath done
[1:03:00] them he shall surely live the soul that
[1:03:03] sinneth it shall die of the son shall
[1:03:05] not bear the iniquity of the father
[1:03:07] neither
[1:03:08] and neither shall the father bear the
[1:03:09] iniquity of the son the righteous the
[1:03:11] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[1:03:13] upon him and the wickedness of the
[1:03:15] wicked shall be upon him
[1:03:18] and if the wicked shall turn from his
[1:03:20] sins
[1:03:21] that he hath committed and kept all his
[1:03:23] statutes and do that which is lawful and
[1:03:25] right he shall surely live he shall not
[1:03:28] die
[1:03:28] all his transgressions that he hath
[1:03:30] committed they shall not be mentioned
[1:03:33] unto him and his righteousness he hath
[1:03:35] done he shall live
[1:03:38] have i any pleasure at all with the weak
[1:03:40] that the wicked should die saith the
[1:03:43] lord god and not that he should return
[1:03:45] from his ways and live but when the
[1:03:47] righteous turneth away from his
[1:03:49] righteousness and committeth iniquity
[1:03:51] and doeth according to all abominations
[1:03:54] that the wicked man doeth shall he live
[1:03:56] all his righteousness that he hath done
[1:04:00] shall not be mentioned in his trespass
[1:04:02] that he hath trespassed in all his sin
[1:04:05] that he hath sinned in them shall he die
[1:04:09] yet ye say the way of the lord is not
[1:04:11] equal here now o house of israel is not
[1:04:14] my way equal or not your ways unequal
[1:04:17] when a righteous man turneth away from
[1:04:20] his righteousness and committeth
[1:04:22] iniquity and dieth in them for his
[1:04:24] iniquity
[1:04:25] that he hath done
[1:04:27] shall he die
[1:04:30] so
[1:04:31] and when when you read all of this and
[1:04:33] and so you know when you see what
[1:04:36] what god is telling them and when they
[1:04:38] when they go back and look and when they
[1:04:40] see what has taken place when when the
[1:04:42] son
[1:04:43] sees that his father has sinned and all
[1:04:45] the wickedness that his father has done
[1:04:47] when he takes
[1:04:49] account of that and he doesn't do what
[1:04:52] his father has done he said then his
[1:04:54] father's sin doesn't rest upon him
[1:04:57] he said but his father's sin rests upon
[1:04:59] him but then when he goes down later and
[1:05:01] he picks up the scripture
[1:05:03] later on you can walk in righteousness
[1:05:07] but he said as soon as you turn from
[1:05:09] your from the way of righteousness
[1:05:12] and he said when you walk away from that
[1:05:14] and you and you still and whether you
[1:05:16] die in that wickedness and you can you
[1:05:18] can walk good and you can you can walk
[1:05:19] in the way of the lord all these years
[1:05:21] but as soon as you turn away and you die
[1:05:24] then you know what it doesn't remember
[1:05:25] any of the any of the good that you've
[1:05:27] done all it remembers is the is the sin
[1:05:29] that falls upon you
[1:05:32] and he says he said that the wicked can
[1:05:34] the wicked and his son can be wicked
[1:05:37] also and they can all do all the
[1:05:38] wickedness they won't do but when they
[1:05:40] get to the place where they turn from
[1:05:41] their wickedness and they begin to walk
[1:05:43] in the statutes of god he said then all
[1:05:45] the things in the past doesn't remember
[1:05:47] them anymore
[1:05:50] and so here they are then then when the
[1:05:52] children of israel come before god and
[1:05:53] they're saying well god that's not fair
[1:05:57] how is it how is it that somebody can
[1:05:59] walk because you know they have a scale
[1:06:01] set up and it's like well you know what
[1:06:03] i only do 25 bad stuff but i do 75
[1:06:06] percent good stuff so that all the way
[1:06:08] the scale i don't tip the scale in my
[1:06:10] favor
[1:06:13] well you know what i only do just this a
[1:06:15] little bit over here and i just do this
[1:06:17] a little bit over here but no it's all
[1:06:19] sin
[1:06:21] it's either you walk in the ways of god
[1:06:23] and you walk in the statutes of god and
[1:06:25] you do the way of god or you're not in
[1:06:27] the way of god at all
[1:06:30] you know he's not god don't have a scale
[1:06:32] where you where you he don't grade you
[1:06:34] on a curve
[1:06:37] you don't have it you don't have any of
[1:06:38] these get out of free jail cards or
[1:06:40] anything like that there's no there's no
[1:06:42] gray areas with god it's either you're
[1:06:44] in the way or you're not
[1:06:47] and so that's what he was telling if
[1:06:48] you're going to walk in the ways of god
[1:06:50] then you've got to be in the ways of god
[1:06:51] all the time
[1:06:53] but you know when you see those things
[1:06:55] when you see that your fathers have done
[1:06:57] those things then you've got to get away
[1:06:58] from the things or they if they do the
[1:07:00] right thing you see them walking in
[1:07:02] righteousness then you have to walk in
[1:07:03] their footsteps then you should be
[1:07:05] following what your fathers have done
[1:07:07] you shouldn't be following something
[1:07:09] else
[1:07:13] i was thinking about that old song about
[1:07:15] uh i'm looking for a hundred because 99
[1:07:18] and a half won't do
[1:07:21] well because god if you're not going to
[1:07:23] if you're not going to be fully sold out
[1:07:24] and committed to god you know god don't
[1:07:26] want to don't want something
[1:07:28] 99.9999 percent
[1:07:38] well how many of y'all want to go to

[1:07:47] half percent of what you make

[1:08:22] either i'm gonna get all of it or ain't
[1:08:23] gonna do none of it

[1:08:28] around and allow you to get above with

[1:09:14] flyers
[1:09:17] because you work for the mail
[1:09:20] hey listen and we don't we don't need
[1:09:22] any more uh political advertisements
[1:09:26] praise the lord there's coming a day
[1:09:28] there won't ever be another political
[1:09:30] advertisement
[1:09:31] you will never have to see one come in

[1:09:43] of it
[1:09:45] but you know if if you're if you won't
[1:09:48] want a hundred percent god wants a
[1:09:50] hundred percent
[1:09:52] god wants a hundred percent from you and
[1:09:55] i that we give a hundred percent
[1:09:58] not not just not not just a portion
[1:10:03] but no we have to be totally sold out
[1:10:04] surrendered to god
[1:10:07] i'm not
[1:10:08] i'm no i'm no longer
[1:10:12] my own
[1:10:13] i belong to jesus
[1:10:17] i'm not my own
[1:10:18] i've been bought with a price
[1:10:22] i am what he's made me
[1:10:28] i'm a prisoner of love
[1:10:30] the love of god
[1:10:34] see we have to come to this place to
[1:10:36] realize god wants us to be this way
[1:10:42] what we've seen
[1:10:44] we've got to be
[1:10:46] totally surrendered totally sold out
[1:10:50] now this is uh hebrews chapter 12
[1:10:53] verse 6 says
[1:10:56] he says for whom he
[1:10:58] says for whom the lord loveth he
[1:11:00] chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[1:11:03] whom he receiveth he said if you endure
[1:11:06] chastening god dealeth with you deal
[1:11:08] with you as with sons as sons
[1:11:13] as with sons for what son is he whom the
[1:11:17] lord chasteneth not
[1:11:21] but if ye be without chastisement
[1:11:23] whereof all are partakers then are ye
[1:11:25] bastards and not sons
[1:11:27] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:11:30] flesh which corrected us
[1:11:32] and have and we gave them reverence
[1:11:35] shall we not much rather be in
[1:11:37] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:11:40] and live
[1:11:41] for they verily
[1:11:43] for a few days chastened us
[1:11:45] after their own pleasure but he for our
[1:11:48] prophet that we might be partakers of
[1:11:51] his holiness now no chastising
[1:11:56] chastening for the present seemeth to be
[1:11:58] joyous but grievous
[1:12:00] nevertheless
[1:12:02] afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[1:12:04] fruit of righteousness
[1:12:06] and to them which are exercised thereby
[1:12:11] i uh
[1:12:15] going to tell a little story
[1:12:17] and uh
[1:12:20] every time every time i read this this
[1:12:22] scripture and
[1:12:24] it was one of the first times i ever
[1:12:26] preached here
[1:12:27] and uh
[1:12:29] mom my mom and dad were here
[1:12:32] and uh
[1:12:33] first time actually the first time they
[1:12:34] ever got to hear me preaching in person
[1:12:37] but
[1:12:38] dad was sitting back toward the back and
[1:12:40] i was reading this scripture and and
[1:12:42] talking about
[1:12:43] having having fathers that chastised us
[1:12:47] and we gave them honor
[1:12:49] and i was i was talking about the way
[1:12:51] you know
[1:12:52] my mom and dad you know and dad dad was
[1:12:55] uh
[1:12:56] for for y'all that that knew my dad you
[1:12:58] know my dad didn't play no games
[1:13:01] he's a yeah
[1:13:03] when it come when it come down to
[1:13:04] business there's lots of sunday mornings
[1:13:06] i woke up and he would come in and jerk
[1:13:08] the covers off of us and
[1:13:10] hit us and wake up
[1:13:13] well you never wanted him to come back
[1:13:14] in there to wake you up
[1:13:17] that was time you woke up praise the
[1:13:19] lord and hit the floor running
[1:13:22] because you didn't ever want him to come
[1:13:23] back in there and wake you up now mom
[1:13:25] might come in there two or three times
[1:13:26] and wake you up
[1:13:28] dad didn't play that game
[1:13:31] but you always always told the story
[1:13:33] that
[1:13:34] i said you know mom you know she might
[1:13:36] she might beat you but dad's the type
[1:13:38] person that he'd tell you like listen we
[1:13:40] got to go outside
[1:13:41] cause i don't want to get blood on the
[1:13:42] floor
[1:13:46] and when i told dad in here dad was
[1:13:48] sitting toward the back back there where
[1:13:49] kind of where sister anna is
[1:13:51] back here and dad was going
[1:13:56] he stared at me
[1:13:58] and he come out the door the first thing
[1:13:59] he told sister dale when he come out the
[1:14:00] door and he walked outside he said that
[1:14:02] didn't happen that didn't happen that
[1:14:05] didn't happen
[1:14:08] but let me tell you something my dad
[1:14:10] meant business
[1:14:13] you know i didn't you don't play games
[1:14:15] there's time for joking a time for
[1:14:17] seriousness and you don't want to cross
[1:14:18] up the two
[1:14:22] but he said whom the lord loveth
[1:14:25] he chases
[1:14:28] there's one thing about it you know when
[1:14:29] when god speaks god god's not confused
[1:14:33] about what he's saying
[1:14:35] just like my dad he didn't he didn't
[1:14:36] play no games he didn't get confused
[1:14:39] and when he when he speaks that he if
[1:14:42] you're a son of god then he said he
[1:14:44] chasteneth you and deals with you as a
[1:14:45] son
[1:14:47] and he and he says we were given fathers
[1:14:50] who chastened us
[1:14:52] and he says he said he chastened us
[1:14:55] after their own pleasure
[1:14:58] and uh
[1:14:59] you know always told everybody it's like
[1:15:00] yeah that's when you know they
[1:15:02] you think sometimes they just
[1:15:05] they just whip you because because that
[1:15:06] feels good but you know what it's not
[1:15:10] but you know it's it's what they
[1:15:14] thought
[1:15:16] was right
[1:15:18] they chase they chastened us after their
[1:15:20] own pleasure which means
[1:15:22] what they thought was correct
[1:15:25] and you know and and
[1:15:27] i i will tell one thing about my dad my
[1:15:30] dad has come back and apologized
[1:15:34] when he was wrong about things
[1:15:37] and i tell you what that takes a man
[1:15:41] and i thought man if i could just be
[1:15:43] half the man that he was
[1:15:46] because you know what that really meant
[1:15:48] that meant a lot to me
[1:15:50] because you can't because not everybody
[1:15:51] owns up to their mistakes
[1:15:56] but he says but he for our prophet why
[1:15:58] because god don't make mistakes
[1:16:01] you know god don't make mistakes god
[1:16:03] don't so whatever god does it's for our
[1:16:05] benefit
[1:16:07] you know god don't do things he's like
[1:16:08] oh i i shouldn't have done that
[1:16:11] no he doesn't he does it right the first
[1:16:13] time
[1:16:14] that we might be partakers
[1:16:16] of his holiness
[1:16:21] that all these things come
[1:16:23] about because
[1:16:25] they they bring out what god houses for
[1:16:27] us
[1:16:30] he says now no chastising chastening of
[1:16:34] the present
[1:16:35] seem to be joyous
[1:16:37] but grievous
[1:16:39] you know i i've never in the in the
[1:16:42] process have i ever have ever been happy
[1:16:44] by it
[1:16:46] he said well you know all things work
[1:16:48] together for the good to them that love
[1:16:50] the lord and it's like well you know you
[1:16:52] know sometimes we're we just hold on to
[1:16:54] that scripture because you know we can't
[1:16:55] see any how this is going to work out we
[1:16:58] don't see any benefit any of it
[1:17:01] but you know what god knows how to work
[1:17:02] it all out
[1:17:06] he said after he said nevertheless
[1:17:08] afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[1:17:10] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[1:17:12] are exercised thereby
[1:17:15] so these things will benefit us
[1:17:18] in the in the future
[1:17:20] and the things that we go through it's a
[1:17:21] benefit to us
[1:17:24] so we are we we go through these things
[1:17:26] and and they're uh
[1:17:29] a blessing that we don't sometimes we
[1:17:30] don't see these things
[1:17:32] but they are a blessing to us
[1:17:36] and
[1:17:37] and so as as we see here
[1:17:39] you know
[1:17:39] we see the the things that
[1:17:42] we we saw in the old testament there and
[1:17:44] and jesus speaking to them
[1:17:46] as they see the the pattern that they
[1:17:49] walk in and the measure that the the
[1:17:52] children walked in
[1:17:55] as as was a
[1:17:57] hindrance and a f as a
[1:18:00] a really a condemnation of falling to
[1:18:03] them
[1:18:04] but here he is speaking these things
[1:18:06] come upon us
[1:18:08] that it's to be a blessing to us
[1:18:11] and so as we as we look you know as we
[1:18:14] see that this this is the the fathers as
[1:18:17] they went one way was a condemnation
[1:18:19] this is a blessing
[1:18:21] so as we see there's a there's a change
[1:18:23] here that we see that one is one way and
[1:18:25] one is the other
[1:18:28] because you know god places people in in
[1:18:30] our in our lives
[1:18:32] to bring us to a place
[1:18:34] and he allows things to happen to bring
[1:18:36] us to a place
[1:18:38] and so you know you know i think i thank
[1:18:41] god because you know
[1:18:42] when we see the things that
[1:18:44] that god has has done for us
[1:18:48] you know because the scripture tells us
[1:18:50] he he gave us a fivefold ministry
[1:18:54] the scripture tells us that he gave us
[1:18:56] he gave us uh
[1:18:57] pastors to feed us
[1:19:00] and and not only were they they defeated
[1:19:03] us but they had hearts
[1:19:05] their hearts was turned to the people
[1:19:07] that god could work through them because
[1:19:09] it was the heart of god in the pastors
[1:19:12] and in the fivefold ministry to reach
[1:19:14] the people
[1:19:16] so all these things that have taken
[1:19:18] place then it was all of these things
[1:19:20] were blessings
[1:19:22] and so um
[1:19:24] all of these things have come
[1:19:26] you know ephesians 4
[1:19:29] i will read this right here it says
[1:19:31] ephesians 4 verse 4 says and there is
[1:19:33] one body one spirit even as you're
[1:19:36] called in one hope of your calling one
[1:19:38] lord one faith one baptism
[1:19:41] one god and father of us all of all who
[1:19:43] is above all through all and in you all
[1:19:46] but unto every one of us has given grace
[1:19:49] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:19:52] god
[1:19:53] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:19:55] on high he led captivity captive and
[1:19:57] gave gifts unto men
[1:20:00] now that he ascended what is it but that
[1:20:03] he also descended first in the lower
[1:20:05] parts of the earth
[1:20:06] but he that descended is the same also
[1:20:08] that ascended far above
[1:20:11] far above all heavens that he might feel
[1:20:14] all things
[1:20:17] so we know that when when these things
[1:20:19] came we've all been given a measure
[1:20:21] by the gift of god
[1:20:24] so we know that he said fill up the
[1:20:26] measure
[1:20:28] that your father's laid
[1:20:31] so
[1:20:32] as we see what they done is you've seen
[1:20:35] what your fathers have done
[1:20:38] and you and you can you're to be held
[1:20:40] accountable for what you do
[1:20:43] according to
[1:20:44] reading there in jeremiah and ezekiel
[1:20:46] you know
[1:20:47] what you've seen in the past you've
[1:20:49] you're held accountable for what you do
[1:20:52] and it has turned to you and each one of
[1:20:54] them have to hold on to their
[1:20:55] accountability they're responsible for
[1:20:57] their own way
[1:20:59] and so we see these things and and we
[1:21:01] know that as they saw this pattern that
[1:21:04] was laid before them
[1:21:06] and you know brother branham
[1:21:08] i was speaking in in the message return
[1:21:10] and jubilee
[1:21:12] and
[1:21:13] and here he's speaking
[1:21:16] and he says he said
[1:21:19] you were born you were born again
[1:21:21] son of god
[1:21:22] he said stay the way god made you that's
[1:21:25] right
[1:21:26] he said many of you pentecostal women he
[1:21:28] said when a woman does that faults on
[1:21:30] the outside the outside only expresses
[1:21:32] what's on the inside it's false on the
[1:21:35] inside
[1:21:36] she's got a false denomination she's
[1:21:38] holding on to instead of christ ought to
[1:21:41] fill her life with the power of his
[1:21:42] resurrection
[1:21:44] instead of that she's took some man-made
[1:21:46] creed
[1:21:47] the outside always expresses what's on
[1:21:49] the inside the trees known by the fruit
[1:21:52] that it bears
[1:21:53] oh my i know you might think i'm
[1:21:55] critical but i'm not critical i'm just
[1:21:58] trying to tell you what's truth
[1:22:00] look where it's got our churches today
[1:22:03] look where we're at
[1:22:05] he said while our mothers wouldn't have
[1:22:08] thought of such a thing
[1:22:11] speaking of of the pentecost
[1:22:16] he says our brothers wouldn't have
[1:22:18] thought of such a thing as an
[1:22:19] organization why you went back there in
[1:22:22] in his early days and
[1:22:25] said something about that they'd laugh
[1:22:27] you right in your face
[1:22:30] we said we come out of that vomit we
[1:22:33] come out of that wall oh god called us
[1:22:35] out
[1:22:37] he said we went back and see what we got
[1:22:39] the same thing
[1:22:41] same thing they are pot all the kettle
[1:22:43] black yes sir that's right six of one
[1:22:46] half dozen of the other creeds and
[1:22:48] things just separated us but brother oh
[1:22:50] i could hold on to this a long time
[1:22:54] but
[1:22:55] let's not do it
[1:22:57] let me give you one
[1:22:59] one good news
[1:23:00] brother he said i i could just hold this
[1:23:02] for a little time
[1:23:04] this is the year of jubilee if you've
[1:23:06] got mixed up in that kind of stuff let's
[1:23:09] return
[1:23:10] we got an inheritance the fathers of
[1:23:12] pentecost fought to win the prize and
[1:23:14] sell through bloody seas let's not walk
[1:23:17] in this flowery bread of ease by joining
[1:23:19] some denomination or settling down and
[1:23:21] saying god bless i'm pentecost he said
[1:23:23] let's get the experience
[1:23:25] let's get back to god
[1:23:28] let's go back to the eagle food let's go
[1:23:30] back to the leadership of the holy
[1:23:32] spirit let's go back to the word of god
[1:23:34] let's go back to the fast and pray while
[1:23:37] the church forgot the street meetings
[1:23:39] long ago the church forgot its long
[1:23:42] nights of prayer why they can't pray 15
[1:23:45] minutes no more oh my when it does it
[1:23:48] it's some it's some little formal thing
[1:23:50] and half of them fall asleep why it's
[1:23:53] it's a disgrace children trying to eat a
[1:23:56] chicken's trying to eat eagles food you
[1:23:58] can't do it won't digest that's right
[1:24:00] you're not built for it you're not built
[1:24:02] for that rugged part got to be built
[1:24:05] rugged and the only way
[1:24:07] you'll ever get that is to be born again
[1:24:10] and change your way and come back
[1:24:13] he said yes sir return to what it's time
[1:24:16] to return return to what brother branham
[1:24:18] return back to the organization i come
[1:24:20] out of no return back to your
[1:24:22] inheritance the heritage that our
[1:24:24] fathers that our father left us he said
[1:24:27] what kind of inheritance did he leave
[1:24:29] wait ye in the city of jerusalem
[1:24:32] until you're endued with power from on
[1:24:34] high that's the inheritance not go join
[1:24:37] this one and go join that one and go
[1:24:39] join this one wait till
[1:24:41] wait till the power comes from on high
[1:24:44] how long
[1:24:45] until
[1:24:47] he said
[1:24:53] he said until one day two days wait
[1:24:55] until don't take some little emotion
[1:24:57] some little frustration wait there until
[1:25:00] you are dead and buried and born again
[1:25:02] anew in christ jesus and every pulsation
[1:25:05] of your life beats out jesus christ so
[1:25:07] you can see the life of christ reflected
[1:25:09] right in your living the way you go yes
[1:25:12] sir till you can find that power like
[1:25:14] they had back there in the beginning
[1:25:16] back to a pentecostal inheritance yes
[1:25:19] sir that's your position possession
[1:25:23] dominant denominations not your
[1:25:25] possession pentecost is your possession
[1:25:28] not a pentecostal organization your
[1:25:30] fathers came out of such thing the
[1:25:32] pentecostal experience is your
[1:25:33] possession examine yourself the sounding
[1:25:36] of the trumpet what kind of trumpet the
[1:25:38] word god's trumpet the word of god
[1:25:41] the whole holy spirit holy ghost is the
[1:25:44] word in the word
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:48] so
[1:25:49] i'm gonna finish up here
[1:25:51] i have have a little bit more but
[1:25:54] i i just want i just want to share with
[1:25:56] this
[1:25:57] you know as as we have we've seen the as
[1:26:00] that we've laid the foundations of what
[1:26:02] they've done in the past
[1:26:04] what we've seen in the past
[1:26:06] what they saw then you know what it's
[1:26:09] it's us to fulfill the measure
[1:26:12] of the fathers
[1:26:15] and you say what what is what is the
[1:26:17] measure
[1:26:19] it's malachi 4.
[1:26:23] the measure that was given was malachi
[1:26:25] 4.
[1:26:26] because he said he said that the the the
[1:26:29] prophet of malachi the messenger was
[1:26:31] going to do two things
[1:26:34] laodicean church age book he said the
[1:26:35] messenger of malachi 4 revelation is to
[1:26:37] do two things
[1:26:39] he said he said according to malachi 4
[1:26:42] he will turn the hearts of the children
[1:26:44] to the fathers too he will reveal the
[1:26:45] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:26:48] revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:26:50] contained in the seven seals it will be
[1:26:52] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:26:54] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:26:56] children to the pentecostal fathers
[1:26:59] exactly so
[1:27:01] so what
[1:27:02] when we see that you know when jesus was
[1:27:04] looking back at them and told them who
[1:27:06] they were
[1:27:07] and he says you fulfill
[1:27:10] fill you up the measure of your fathers
[1:27:14] well who are our fathers
[1:27:18] the word that came before us
[1:27:20] all of the ones he said he said this
[1:27:22] message would turn us back to the
[1:27:24] pentecostal fathers
[1:27:27] to the word that came before us
[1:27:30] one because then when we see how it
[1:27:33] turns to goes back to that because here
[1:27:36] they are they rebuked
[1:27:40] to do all that god has called us to do
[1:27:43] because he rebuked them for doing the
[1:27:44] things that their fathers had done
[1:27:47] and he told them said you go do what
[1:27:48] your fathers have done
[1:27:51] well brothers and sisters god has called
[1:27:53] us to do the exact same thing walk in
[1:27:55] the way that he has made
[1:28:00] he called us to walk in the way that
[1:28:02] that has been given that's been prepared
[1:28:04] for us
[1:28:06] that we've seen that we've seen the ones
[1:28:08] and
[1:28:09] he was speaking of the ones in pentecost
[1:28:11] and what what pentecost done in the past
[1:28:13] and those that have come before
[1:28:16] god laid it out before us he said what
[1:28:17] kind of people are we to be
[1:28:21] what kind of people we ought to be he
[1:28:23] said in every work and every deed and
[1:28:25] every action what kind of people we
[1:28:27] ought to be because if we've seen what
[1:28:29] has come before and he said he said they
[1:28:32] didn't come they didn't come through on
[1:28:34] a flowery bed of these he said when you
[1:28:36] see that they had to had to fight to win
[1:28:38] the prize when all the things that they
[1:28:40] went through has come to us all the way
[1:28:43] you know because though all the word has
[1:28:44] come to us and and all of the all the
[1:28:47] bloodshed and all the things that has
[1:28:49] happened all the way to you know because
[1:28:51] we you know
[1:28:54] all the sacrifices that has been made
[1:28:57] all the things that has taken place you
[1:28:58] know what then we have to what kind of
[1:29:00] people ought to eat to be if we've seen
[1:29:02] the things that have taken place if if
[1:29:05] god has been gracious enough to show us
[1:29:07] these things what kind of people ought
[1:29:09] to eat to be that we should face every
[1:29:11] every day brother i said he said you
[1:29:13] know every day we should live and walk
[1:29:16] and speak like it's our last
[1:29:19] why we should we should walk and we
[1:29:21] should fulfill walk in the fullness
[1:29:23] thereof walk in the floor everything
[1:29:25] that god has given you walk in the
[1:29:27] fullness of it
[1:29:28] walking at one because it's because our
[1:29:30] fathers the ones in the past that have
[1:29:34] have paved the way have done all the
[1:29:35] work have struggled and sacrificed to
[1:29:37] bring us to this place then you know we
[1:29:39] should be standing so much higher than
[1:29:41] where we are
[1:29:43] we should be so thankful and and realize
[1:29:46] who we are and what and every single
[1:29:48] thing as brother brian said whatever you
[1:29:49] do everything we should pretend think
[1:29:53] look at this like it's our last
[1:29:56] this we don't we don't know what our
[1:29:58] last day's going to be but we ought to
[1:29:59] give our fullness to god we should give
[1:30:02] every ass to everything we should pay a
[1:30:04] more earnest to the word that we have
[1:30:06] heard
[1:30:08] do the fulfill
[1:30:10] fill up on the word
[1:30:13] be the fullness thereof amen
[1:30:16] let's all stand will have the musicians
[1:30:18] come
[1:30:24] i have that desire
[1:30:31] thank god that we've had fathers that
[1:30:32] have brought us to this place fathers in
[1:30:35] the gospel
[1:30:38] you know i was thinking the other day
[1:30:39] then
[1:30:41] you know
[1:30:43] we have people
[1:30:44] come in our lives and
[1:30:47] you know
[1:30:49] just like
[1:30:50] children
[1:30:53] you know you have you have a you have
[1:30:54] children that that grow up well you know
[1:30:56] you can only do so much for them
[1:30:59] when that when they're little you know
[1:31:00] you can you feed them and you clothe
[1:31:02] them and you bathe them and you do all
[1:31:03] those things
[1:31:05] and you get to the point where you try
[1:31:06] to teach them how to feed themselves and
[1:31:08] teach them how to walk
[1:31:12] but you know there's only so much that
[1:31:13] you do for them
[1:31:15] and then the next time you know what
[1:31:16] they get to a certain age and there
[1:31:18] comes a teacher
[1:31:21] and you got to send them off to school
[1:31:23] try to teach them their abcs and learn
[1:31:25] how to read
[1:31:26] and all those things well you know what
[1:31:28] then there's other people that's got to
[1:31:29] come along and lead you
[1:31:31] amen
[1:31:34] i was thinking about brother dale where
[1:31:35] he's talking about
[1:31:36] you know he said all the preachers
[1:31:38] that's come before him
[1:31:40] and he said when he even in the baptist
[1:31:42] church he said all the the pastors that
[1:31:44] were there you know he thanked them for
[1:31:46] what they've done for him why because
[1:31:47] they brought him to a place
[1:31:50] and so you know they you know all the
[1:31:52] ones that have come and even even the
[1:31:54] pastor i think about the pastors that
[1:31:55] i've had in this message you know and
[1:31:57] the brothers you know they've done what
[1:31:59] they could but you know what that wasn't
[1:32:00] the place that i was supposed to be
[1:32:03] there was there was a place that each
[1:32:05] one of them brought me to but you know
[1:32:06] what i had to go on beyond that
[1:32:09] and so you know what you don't teach
[1:32:10] your kids algebra but you know what you
[1:32:12] want them to learn it
[1:32:14] so there's somebody else that's got to
[1:32:16] come on and take this and carry it
[1:32:18] further and so you know there there is a
[1:32:20] group that's coming to the fivefold
[1:32:22] ministry that's continued to carry this
[1:32:24] thing on and thank god we've gotten to
[1:32:26] the place that we've got somebody that
[1:32:27] can carry us all the way
[1:32:32] and so here we are now we've reached
[1:32:33] this place well you know now we can come
[1:32:35] to the fullness
[1:32:36] that we can come to the finish
[1:32:39] and that's what that's what my desire is
[1:32:41] i want i want to do all that i can
[1:32:46] i i was telling brother donnie
[1:32:49] i was
[1:32:52] i was thinking about a message i
[1:32:53] preached years ago when
[1:32:59] when you see when you see things and
[1:33:01] and you see the condition that things
[1:33:03] are in
[1:33:06] and
[1:33:07] there was a the man that told him
[1:33:09] i was
[1:33:10] heard about and
[1:33:15] and years ago he this this man and i i
[1:33:18] don't remember his name but i just
[1:33:20] remember the story but he was a he was a
[1:33:22] missionary in india
[1:33:24] and every so often he would come to he
[1:33:26] would come to the united states and
[1:33:28] as when he come he would come to
[1:33:31] churches and he would preach and they
[1:33:32] would raise money for the missions and
[1:33:34] things that were going on in india
[1:33:36] and so as he was traveling through this
[1:33:38] is
[1:33:39] decades ago but this man was coming
[1:33:41] through and as he was driving through
[1:33:43] the midwest he it was going down the
[1:33:45] road he saw these uh combines out in the
[1:33:47] field it was on a sunday and he was
[1:33:49] traveling from one church to another one
[1:33:52] and he was coming through and he saw all
[1:33:53] of these combines going through the
[1:33:55] middle of the the fields everybody just
[1:33:57] working as fast as they can trying to
[1:33:59] get everything done
[1:34:03] and he stopped and he stopped one of the
[1:34:05] men and he asked him he's like what are
[1:34:08] y'all doing
[1:34:09] he said i figured all these people out
[1:34:10] here church going people he said why are
[1:34:12] y'all out here working he said oh
[1:34:14] brother we are because you know he told
[1:34:16] him i'm a minister he said brother we
[1:34:19] are
[1:34:21] he said but you see this field
[1:34:23] he said it's white
[1:34:25] it's time for harvest
[1:34:27] we got to get this field in he said
[1:34:29] there's a storm coming

[1:34:34] said we're working right now he said
[1:34:36] because whatever we don't get in is
[1:34:38] going to be lost
[1:34:40] and he said brother he said i can't
[1:34:42] stand here and talk anymore he said i
[1:34:43] got to get out and he said well god
[1:34:44] bless you and he went on down the road
[1:34:47] so thankful that there is a place that
[1:34:49] we can hide
[1:34:50] because we can hide under the shelter of
[1:34:52] his wings why because he has promised
[1:34:54] that to us but you know what we've got
[1:34:56] to prepare and we've got to be the ones
[1:34:58] that the only people that the world's
[1:34:59] going to know that there's a storm
[1:35:01] coming that they're not going to be able
[1:35:03] to stand and that is us we've got to
