[0:19] it's a shirt I've lost 30 pounds you're
[0:22] out of him man
[0:24] but yeah I've been over you've been
[0:26] hanging around
[0:27] oh people too long
[0:31] all right let's go to I want to read I
[0:34] want to read a scripture here let's
[0:36] let's go back over here I didn't put all
[0:38] this together because I don't know how
[0:39] to do all this like Bob and everyone
[0:40] knows how to do it but let's go to John
[0:44] and let's start we go into three sons
[0:47] name that's what we've been talking
[0:49] about or what we kind of give a preview
[0:51] last Sunday all right and I hope you
[0:54] enjoy this because I'm real this this
[0:57] brings in Genesis one it brings in the
[0:59] creation brings in a lot of what brother
[1:01] Nails already been talking about but
[1:03] we're gonna stay on the titles of the
[1:05] three sons name which was what son of
[1:08] man Son of God Son of David now that is
[1:11] not a complete order
[1:13] because brother Brown starts with Jesus
[1:15] Son of Man then Son of God Spirit God
[1:17] and then he goes to son of David well we
[1:20] know the son of David is going to be in
[1:22] the Millennium we'll talk about his
[1:23] characteristics later the son of man was
[1:26] the one that was on the Earth but the
[1:27] Son of God is the one before the
[1:29] foundation of the world all right so
[1:32] we're going to read this and then we're
[1:33] going to read something that brother
[1:34] Brown said and then we're going to kind
[1:35] of put the picture in because watch this
[1:37] because in the beginning was the word
[1:40] and word was with God
[1:43] and the word what was God
[1:45] turn on electronics
[1:50] okay
[1:51] in the beginning what's the word a word
[1:53] was with God and the Word was God the
[1:56] same was in the beginning with God
[1:59] so there's not anything different it's
[2:01] the same
[2:02] all right all things were made by him
[2:06] as a person it wasn't made by what man
[2:10] would say a light or a spirit but this
[2:13] Spirit man has formed
[2:16] he's a human if we're Made In His Image
[2:18] God has never been anything but a human
[2:21] form right that's right amen and we're
[2:24] going to read where brother around said
[2:25] nobody's seen God at any time and that's
[2:27] the truth I'm not seeing you
[2:30] I'm not seeing the real you
[2:32] right the real you resides inside all
[2:34] right all things were made by him
[2:37] and without him was not anything made
[2:40] that was made so we know that whatever
[2:43] this was so let's go to this word thank
[2:46] God for Bob showing me this program and
[2:48] putting it on here I like this because
[2:50] you do cross reference what's that word
[2:52] right there
[2:54] low guys
[2:56] all right now that's a big word that's
[2:59] actually a little word but watch the
[3:01] meaning of it's of speech a word
[3:04] uttered by a living voice
[3:08] embodies a conception or idea all right
[3:13] because remember watch what the word
[3:16] logo means
[3:20] right yeah what is the word logo
[3:23] it describes what your business is right
[3:26] the logo oh okay lights are on now well
[3:31] look that word is logos that word comes
[3:33] from the root meaning
[3:35] oh we brought it in the logo
[3:39] which is what we put it up this is our
[3:42] logo this is our you know Matt down
[3:45] State Farm Act it describes who he is
[3:47] and what he is
[4:00] but logo shows
[4:03] but remember
[4:04] but remember it's just a form of the
[4:07] business
[4:08] it's not the whole business yeah right
[4:10] it's the logo
[4:15] listen don't have it but you know you
[4:16] see a little thing stuck funeral home or
[4:18] whatever it's the logo all right what
[4:21] the word that describes your business
[4:24] same way with logos it's the word that
[4:27] describes God
[4:30] conception or ideal now we don't we know
[4:32] that God's not a conception
[4:36] God is real right okay he's not just an
[4:39] idea he's the only idea he's the word
[4:41] period he's the only word all right now
[4:45] look what someone has said a word the
[4:47] sayings of God
[4:50] now what God is doing here watch what
[4:52] God's doing and you'll see the you'll
[4:54] see the very Foundation
[4:56] of why God had to come from
[4:59] brother Brown will say great Eternal
[5:01] cover all space Time and Eternity
[5:04] and he steps into logos
[5:07] why not that God can understand us so
[5:10] that we can understand the logo
[5:14] of what his business is and what he's
[5:16] fixing to do yeah
[5:18] everybody got that same man this is
[5:20] going by I don't want to run past
[5:21] anybody but that's the logo that's what
[5:24] is coming forth that God is being able
[5:28] to represent in word now what he is
[5:31] because I want somebody to Define
[5:34] eternal
[5:41] we can't conceive that right
[5:44] right can you really honestly can you
[5:46] conceive
[5:47] never beginning
[5:49] when you go back 10 billion billion
[5:50] billion billion years there's somebody
[5:52] stood
[5:53] when you go back more years never
[5:56] somebody stood that's right
[5:58] when you go 10B million years that way
[6:01] there's somebody stands
[6:05] can you right can you comprehend that
[6:08] though no you cannot comprehend that I
[6:10] cannot comprehend never having a
[6:12] beginning and never having an end in my
[6:14] Humanity
[6:16] that's right let's just be honest
[6:18] when it says then the word was with God
[6:21] you automatically think you know outside
[6:25] of God right but the word now that
[6:27] you're talking
[6:28] well see what the Lord our son the logos
[6:31] came out didn't come out of God and make
[6:33] a separate person
[6:34] but it was with God
[6:37] because what watch this here's here's
[6:40] the here's an analogy June and I are
[6:43] developing
[6:44] a logo for Daleville Farms or Daleville
[6:48] bee farm
[6:49] now
[6:51] what that is is the description of the
[6:53] business right but where did it come
[6:55] from
[6:58] it came from my idea and her idea and
[7:01] then being put into word or into
[7:05] script right decree mandate or order
[7:10] the what Old Testament prophecy given by
[7:13] the prophets with the logos obviously
[7:15] that was for Christ we're going to talk
[7:16] about that a little bit later but I love
[7:18] this one this
[7:19] um definition here you know that's of
[7:23] speech a word under by Olivia was now
[7:25] what it is we had this conception in our
[7:28] mind
[7:30] embodies a conception or idea we got
[7:33] this idea now remember let's go back to
[7:35] what brother Brown said brother Brown
[7:36] said God had a plan right and a purpose
[7:40] where did it come from he said let's go
[7:42] back in the back part of God's mind
[7:45] because God can't do anything to help us
[7:48] understand him without going the same
[7:50] way we understand how we live here just
[7:53] like Jen and I sat down we go okay we're
[7:55] going to sell this kind of product we're
[7:56] going to do this now it's not in Word
[7:59] it's not developed yet it's an idea
[8:01] right but when we do Daleville bee farm
[8:05] obviously one thing's for sure it's got
[8:07] to have to do something with beef
[8:09] and honey and maybe some of the other
[8:11] things that go along with it right you
[8:13] see how this is developing well see you
[8:15] don't understand that unless we tell you
[8:16] right right
[8:18] it's our idea and we know all the if
[8:22] ands and buts about it we know every bit
[8:24] of it we can see the conception or idea
[8:27] but one day it's going to become
[8:29] embodied
[8:32] in a store or an online
[8:35] is that okay you know we're going to
[8:37] develop that and then we're going to
[8:39] show it
[8:41] we're gonna show it to the people yeah
[8:43] that's the same way God is
[8:45] because you can't understand what we're
[8:46] thinking about
[8:49] but when we take what we have yeah
[8:53] and either put it on paper or a logo and
[8:56] then we begin to develop that then
[8:59] you're going to be unable to understand
[9:00] the conception same thing with Microsoft
[9:03] same thing with apple and although they
[9:04] started with nothing but just a simple
[9:08] arithmetic that's all it is there's only
[9:11] 10 there's only 10 numbers zero through
[9:14] nine
[9:15] right it's just a combination of those
[9:18] first computer I ever saw I was at
[9:20] Guilford High School Guildford high
[9:21] school girls were grammar school and a
[9:23] guy comes by and he says this is a new
[9:26] thing and he takes and he's got a little
[9:28] pad with a cup and he's pouring
[9:32] um marbles or something in the thing
[9:34] well the computer's counting it like
[9:36] only go from zero to nine and it just
[9:38] Loops back over again well over here
[9:40] it's tallying it up
[9:42] to me that was what it was a plan
[9:45] somebody had a plan then they were
[9:47] getting ready to develop look what it
[9:48] developed into
[9:50] computers now you don't even need to
[9:53] wire anything up
[9:55] phones that work anywhere
[9:57] you know Bob's watch and get emails in
[10:01] his watch
[10:02] now they got an apple there's an Apple
[10:05] or Google uh watch everybody's got one
[10:07] now okay well not everybody
[10:09] and they have Google Glasses what did
[10:12] that come from listen to what I'm saying
[10:14] that come from and just somebody sitting
[10:16] down like Dave Ramsey Dave Ramsey's 20
[10:19] something years ago broke bankrupt
[10:21] didn't have a
[10:23] what we talking about telling how to pop
[10:24] the do nothing in cooking
[10:28] but now he's now he's a president of a
[10:31] 30 million dollar Corporation in 25
[10:33] years he said it started at a card table
[10:36] with me and my wife we'll see what was
[10:37] he doing
[10:39] he was like logos
[10:41] he was writing it down he was the great
[10:44] one that had this great mind of course
[10:46] it's limited God's not but our brand is
[10:49] limited but whatever idea we have that's
[10:52] what we're gonna do now with man we make
[10:54] mistakes so you can't use the whole
[10:55] analogy but you can still see the
[10:57] concept
[10:59] are the conception the concept was God
[11:04] is so great nobody can understand me so
[11:07] I'm going to develop down yeah same man
[11:10] right but I'm going to develop down
[11:12] first by low gospel because logos is my
[11:15] logo that's what I'm going to show to
[11:17] the people because what that word was
[11:20] what finally was made Flash
[11:22] now that's the son of man but you got to
[11:24] go back up here we got to stay with the
[11:25] Son of God but that word right here
[11:32] what is declared a thought declaration
[11:36] aphorism a weighty saying a discourse
[11:40] the act of speaking or speech The
[11:44] Faculty of speech now it's not
[11:47] here's Here's my thought it's what
[11:49] brother Brandon was talking about
[11:52] because remember when God ever speaks it
[11:54] has to happen right right
[11:57] so he had to have the thought first
[11:58] because when he starts speaking it it's
[12:00] going to happen it's not like me and you
[12:01] like Jen and I sitting down trying to
[12:03] develop a develop a logo and develop a
[12:05] list and develop that well we're
[12:06] throwing out 5 000 different ideas God's
[12:09] got one idea God's got one plan
[12:11] hey man he knew everything so before he
[12:14] could say anything that plan had to be
[12:16] saw he had to see the plan
[12:18] amen he had to see it by foreigners he
[12:21] had to see that whole plan then he could
[12:23] begin to speak that plan into existence
[12:26] because remember
[12:28] sure he was logos he was Son of God he
[12:31] was all these things
[12:33] but you have to take what brother Brown
[12:35] says and go all the way back to where he
[12:37] was covering everything let that mean
[12:40] God was just like a vapor right no God
[12:44] was a man yeah
[12:45] yeah he was a human he's the only human
[12:47] that ever lived
[12:48] amen
[12:50] but he had a plan and a purpose because
[12:53] inside of him June and my desire is is
[12:56] to get product out so people can
[12:58] purchase it same way with God
[13:01] but remember in God we can't purchase it
[13:05] he had to come and purchase it for us
[13:07] right then he give it back to us right
[13:09] remember the quote Jesus didn't come to
[13:11] bring you an inheritance your
[13:13] inheritance was before the foundation of
[13:14] the world he just came to make a way to
[13:16] you get back to your American right
[13:18] because we got l-o-s-t we got lost okay
[13:21] but this to me was wonderful once I was
[13:24] seeing this
[13:25] where that God and you know the
[13:29] difference in God thinking and speaking
[13:31] it
[13:32] because remember
[13:34] when he thought it he's no more older
[13:37] than when he thought it than today right
[13:40] explain that
[13:42] that's how the word was with him that's
[13:44] what I'm getting that's correct that's
[13:46] right that's right
[13:48] that's right it resided in him right
[13:50] right it wasn't with him beside him
[13:52] because you can go on through a little
[13:54] bit more and they'll talk about
[13:56] this is not it but there's a
[14:00] oh yeah right here
[14:02] because watch it says in John denotes
[14:05] the essential word of God Jesus Christ
[14:07] and personal wisdom and power and Union
[14:09] with God his ministry and creation and
[14:10] government of the universe the cause of
[14:11] all the world's life both physical and
[14:13] ethical which for the procurement of
[14:15] man's salvation put on human nature and
[14:17] the person abused on Messiah the second
[14:19] person in the godhead well you know
[14:22] can we just spit that
[14:24] we need to spit that seed out and just
[14:26] keep on eating the pie right just spit
[14:28] that seed out because remember
[14:30] they didn't have a revelation like we
[14:32] did right okay this comes from Strong's
[14:34] Concordance okay
[14:37] excuse me
[14:40] so they they identify him as the second
[14:43] person in the godhead coach when they do
[14:44] say with God that's what they say that
[14:46] it was with God another person
[14:49] but it's not it's the same person
[14:52] just moving over into a form that he can
[14:54] say Let There be okay is everybody okay
[14:57] with that
[14:58] but when now when you see the word logo
[15:00] think hello God
[15:02] sometimes you wouldn't want to put that
[15:04] together but but he does describe what's
[15:07] behind the sign yeah
[15:09] amen I mean it describes what's behind
[15:12] the sign right
[15:14] okay everybody got that say amen amen
[15:17] all right everybody win that so in the
[15:18] beginning was the word sometimes it
[15:21] helps somebody sometimes we like I said
[15:23] before sometimes we read that like a
[15:25] newspaper
[15:26] get this program and and just mask your
[15:30] finger on that word and it'll pop up the
[15:32] definition and
[15:34] the cross reference which is Strong's
[15:36] Concordance I like that
[15:38] because sometimes the words
[15:40] don't exactly mean
[15:43] what it shows what we think it means
[15:45] right because see the same was in the
[15:47] beginning with god well did God have a
[15:50] beginning no God never had a beginning
[15:52] but brother Brown did say
[15:53] go ahead of the beginning but look
[15:55] origin
[15:57] origin
[15:59] right
[16:01] the first person or thing in the series
[16:03] The Leader
[16:05] okay so he's a leader
[16:08] that by which anything yes a feminine
[16:10] noun
[16:12] all right okay so look up these things
[16:15] sometimes
[16:16] but look all things were made by whoever
[16:19] this is
[16:20] all things were made by him
[16:23] right all right so it has to be God
[16:26] could keep that thought forever and ever
[16:27] and ever and then but once he drops down
[16:30] into the logos or speech he begins to
[16:33] speak that word and he can't be taken
[16:35] back he's already thought it out in his
[16:37] mind everything's perfect it's going to
[16:40] happen that way but it's going to happen
[16:42] because he for an instant look down
[16:45] through time
[16:46] saw everything that was going on that's
[16:48] see to me that's
[16:50] I can't understand how that somebody in
[16:53] India
[16:54] 600 years ago God knew that who that man
[16:56] was what he was going to think
[16:59] there's six billion people in the world
[17:01] right now God knew every one of their
[17:03] thoughts for the foundation of the world
[17:04] he knew what they were going to good and
[17:06] bad yeah he knew what their life was
[17:09] going to be and you the day they were
[17:10] going to be born the day they were going
[17:11] to die now how in the world are we going
[17:13] to understand that kind of a guy unless
[17:16] that he comes down and narrows his self
[17:18] down
[17:19] so now we can take this great Eternal
[17:21] and we can say well now he's beginning
[17:24] to speak so he is beginning to show
[17:28] himself our logos he's beginning to
[17:30] speak what he has in his in his heart
[17:35] okay okay
[17:37] what's the name of the problem huh
[17:40] yeah
[17:43] Bob Bob
[17:44] hold on man
[17:50] go back
[17:57] something it's
[18:00] um
[18:08] let's see
[18:20] all right get this thing back to the
[18:23] back to the beginning
[18:31] yeah I reckon
[18:35] it's uh
[18:39] it's got all it's got a bunch of
[18:41] different Bible translations even the
[18:42] Korean
[18:47] Bible
[18:50] t-e-c-a-r-t-a Bible okay
[18:53] and it's an app
[18:56] obviously it's an app you can get for I
[19:00] guess
[19:03] okay and don't worry these are Deanna's
[19:06] they're not mine
[19:08] yeah sure are you sure all right no but
[19:12] no but that that right there that's mine
[19:14] right there get out of there quick
[19:17] all right now let's go here to the
[19:19] quotes
[19:20] let's watch what brother Brown says here
[19:23] there's a Bible part that goes there's
[19:25] another Bible that comes with your with
[19:27] your tablet but it does not have the
[19:29] strong support it's in it this one has
[19:31] the strongest quartz and several
[19:33] translations of the Bible
[19:34] so I love that
[19:36] um
[19:37] if we look up here logos now look
[19:42] all right let's let's let brother Brown
[19:44] develop this
[19:47] and questions and answers on Genesis
[19:54] let's read verse 21. now if God created
[19:56] man in his own or
[19:58] paragraph 21. now if God's created man
[20:00] in his own image and his own lightness
[20:02] what kind of a man did he create Spirit
[20:04] man
[20:06] now if you'll notice after he made all
[20:07] the creation and created Spirit man
[20:09] we're gonna we're gonna read this down
[20:10] and then go back all right that God gave
[20:13] dominion over the cattle and the fish
[20:14] and everything to the man
[20:16] but it is making up there he made him in
[20:19] his own image to lead the cattle so now
[20:21] who was Adam Adam was the first man
[20:25] in the Lord creation okay all right he
[20:29] was in other words Adam the first man in
[20:31] the lower creation
[20:33] oh sorry the lower creations of God the
[20:36] first creation was God himself
[20:39] there you go oh wait a minute
[20:42] remember look up that word creation that
[20:45] word creation means fashion
[20:50] like I said before
[20:53] automobiles were in the Garden of Eden
[20:55] this computer the components of this
[20:58] computer was in the Garden of Eden you
[20:59] say how in the elements right amen right
[21:03] you were in the Earth right
[21:07] your body was at your 16 elements never
[21:10] changed from the time of the beginning
[21:11] down to now right but what did man do
[21:15] Man created an automobile
[21:19] out of all these parks that were already
[21:22] here so when he says God created man or
[21:25] the first creation was God himself no
[21:27] it's just like I said it's God putting
[21:29] everything together
[21:30] so that we can understand it all right
[21:33] nobody understand that right he
[21:35] fashioned
[21:36] he fashioned
[21:38] the first fashion was God himself
[21:41] had to have an image to start with right
[21:43] right because there had to be a man made
[21:46] in the image of God I saw the image of
[21:47] God had to be okay
[21:49] got it yep okay same like I said like an
[21:52] automobile Man created they can't save
[21:54] it they say well
[21:57] Henry Ford says I created the automobile
[21:59] sure he did
[22:01] but he didn't he's not God he can't take
[22:05] nothing and he can just say car right
[22:09] he had to take the Earth the things in
[22:11] the Earth the chemicals the rubber the
[22:13] plastic the metal The Ore the iron and
[22:17] put it together
[22:18] and say Here's my creation right right
[22:22] here's my creation right uh sister Gabby
[22:25] that um uh cake last night he was a
[22:28] creation it wasn't anywhere it was in
[22:30] the ground
[22:31] you say how's that come from sugar milk
[22:34] eggs right take it back people on this
[22:38] just as simple as it can be your body
[22:40] the same way brother Brown said always
[22:41] 16 other ones 16 other ones 16 elements
[22:45] right
[22:47] and to me the cosmic like that he's
[22:49] always talked about is that firing
[22:50] mechanism that's inside of you that
[22:54] in the beginning God created everything
[22:57] and man fashioned everything from that
[23:01] country right that's correct but we say
[23:03] creation yes Apple computer was created
[23:07] by Steve Jobs
[23:08] well technically yes it was but it was
[23:11] more of put together it's always been
[23:14] here right television's always been in
[23:17] within the Garden of Eden brother Brown
[23:18] said right because it's a vision right
[23:21] Moses had a vision right he had a
[23:24] computer screen pop up and there he saw
[23:26] what happened in the Garden of Eden I
[23:29] don't believe that God handed him a
[23:31] piece of paper and said this is what
[23:32] happened
[23:33] the Bible or man says Moses wrote
[23:37] Moses wrote the first five books of the
[23:40] Bible so God just opened a vision like I
[23:42] said about brother Branham he would be
[23:44] standing in front of somebody and you
[23:45] see him in that movie you see him kind
[23:47] of move his eyes kind of move away from
[23:49] the person or up above him what's he
[23:51] doing
[23:53] watching the screen yeah he's
[23:57] he's a table being by a doctor and
[23:59] you've got cancer on your left breast
[24:01] well he's standing there watching it
[24:02] just like it's a movie
[24:04] that's the vision man has just took him
[24:07] perverted it making it television
[24:09] but it was always in the Garden of Eden
[24:11] it was all it's always been
[24:13] amen
[24:16] Isaiah
[24:18] I saw them
[24:19] you know train of the yeah in the temple
[24:23] I saw the trouble what's he doing he's
[24:24] looking at a vision he's letting
[24:25] something opened up in front of him and
[24:28] he could see it
[24:30] I think they literally see these things
[24:32] I don't think God just put a premonition
[24:34] in his mind right no I think they saw
[24:37] brother Branham
[24:39] Eve had blonde hair blue eyes Adam's
[24:43] shoulders was a little broad with
[24:45] shoulder length hair he was watching the
[24:48] whole thing remember he's the eagle that
[24:50] goes up above everything and can see
[24:52] just as far this way this way this way
[24:54] this way right so God put him in a
[24:56] vision
[24:57] I want you to if you can if you can find
[25:00] it
[25:01] we don't have time to get done
[25:03] um
[25:05] Google George Smith on YouTube
[25:10] and he does in 2011 he's when brother
[25:13] Jeff Jenkins was still in the message
[25:15] he had George come up and
[25:19] for about two hours almost tell his
[25:22] story
[25:24] of his story of brother Brown coming up
[25:26] from horny brother Branham and and he
[25:29] George goes back to the 1945 when he was
[25:32] born and brings up where his mama and
[25:35] daddy went to Mexico and he grew up in
[25:37] Mexico and lived in Mexico for 20
[25:39] something years and and then he goes and
[25:42] meets brother Branham and he said all
[25:44] these different but what there's a lot
[25:45] of Supernatural things that he said a
[25:47] lot of things happened he said that
[25:49] brother Brandon would tell me
[25:51] and I'd be like
[25:54] and then years later it happened he said
[25:57] well brother randomly said when I walked
[25:59] up he said well around was looking in a
[26:01] vision
[26:01] he was seeing
[26:03] what was going on years later
[26:06] even brother George when he received he
[26:07] told Brother George he said you cannot
[26:09] marry my daughter to you and my daughter
[26:10] receive the Holy Ghost
[26:12] he said he was in Texas with brother
[26:14] Perry green
[26:15] just la la line out you know just
[26:18] spending time and you know and but he
[26:21] got to pray in one night and said he
[26:23] felt like everything was settled he said
[26:26] the next morning brother Branham called
[26:28] him at seven o'clock I believe it was
[26:30] that morning and said brother George I
[26:31] want to be the first one to congratulate
[26:33] you on receiving the Holy Ghost he said
[26:35] now how'd that man know that all right
[26:37] he said God told him he said now you can
[26:40] marry my daughter
[26:41] so of course they didn't get married I
[26:43] didn't know this I thought brother Brown
[26:44] married them but he didn't they got
[26:46] married after brother round and got
[26:47] killed
[26:48] uh
[26:49] several months after Bill Brown got
[26:51] killed yeah they were married I think
[26:53] California brother George was in the
[26:54] Army he was into Vietnam War
[26:56] yeah but do I protected him in camping
[26:59] during that time so but go to that it
[27:01] come from bro
[27:03] what's the name of that church brother
[27:06] Chad Lounge church now uh BC Fellowship
[27:10] Believers Christian Fellowship but put
[27:13] George Smith in and put in YouTube and
[27:15] it'll come up and it's about an hour and
[27:17] 30 minutes or so and he's done a real
[27:18] good job of just telling this story he
[27:20] wasn't trying to present no Doctrine but
[27:22] he was telling the story of how he met
[27:24] brother Brown and all the supernatural
[27:25] things that went on during that time and
[27:28] a lot of things that Rebecca told him
[27:30] that I didn't know he's a lot of things
[27:31] Rebecca told him that happened
[27:34] before he even met her all right but
[27:36] look in other words let's read this
[27:37] quote and then we'll go we're gonna stop
[27:38] right here and then we'll take off
[27:40] because we're going to take a trip here
[27:42] but look he was in other words Adam the
[27:44] first man of the Lord creation of God
[27:46] first creation was God himself everybody
[27:48] okay with that that doesn't stump me
[27:50] okay
[27:51] then out of God comes the logos now what
[27:53] is the law the speech the logo what's
[27:55] fits into happen what I've got in my
[27:57] mind I'm fixing to bring it so you can
[28:00] see it
[28:01] which was the what Son of God so the Son
[28:04] of God is before everything before
[28:06] there's even a
[28:08] um an atom or anything he's always been
[28:11] the Son of God Amen he's always been the
[28:13] son of man he's always been these things
[28:14] all right he's just what developing or
[28:17] fashioning them all right because
[28:19] remember Revelation 3 14 says the
[28:22] beginning Jesus was the beginning of the
[28:23] creation of God the beginning of the
[28:25] fashioning of the way God wanted to be
[28:28] had there not been a fall then out of
[28:30] the logos which was the word in the
[28:33] beginning was word words with God's word
[28:34] was God and the Word was made flesh is
[28:35] one among us out of the logos came forth
[28:38] the man so what was the logos the one
[28:43] that was speaking in Genesis 1.
[28:46] God said let us make man in our own
[28:49] image
[28:51] right okay
[28:53] all right let's stop right there
[28:58] amen thank you
