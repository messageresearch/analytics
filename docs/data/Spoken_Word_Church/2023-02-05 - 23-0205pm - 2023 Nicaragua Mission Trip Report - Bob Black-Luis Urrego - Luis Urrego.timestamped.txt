[0:36] joining loved ones round the throne at
[0:40] last we'll all be gathered home that
[0:44] will be the greatest thrill
[0:48] foreign
[0:50] [Music]
[1:48] happy
[1:49] faces praising God in Heavenly places
[1:54] what a thrill that I feel when I get
[1:57] together with
[1:59] God it's wonderful people
[2:05] God bless you all you'll be seated just
[2:07] for a moment sister milka has a
[2:08] testimony to share with us
[2:16] ual the reason I'm having this testimony
[2:20] the song was saying this morning just
[2:22] really reminded me and of what I need to
[2:24] thank God for and I'm gonna waste the
[2:26] time
[2:27] sometimes I don't want to tear my
[2:29] testimony because sometimes I'm ashamed
[2:30] but this song really brought me out and
[2:33] also Benjamin called me the other day
[2:35] and he said oh mommy do you not want to
[2:37] be the big 2-0 and uh that just reminded
[2:39] me I'm like my goodness it's been 20
[2:41] years uh 20 years ago I January 6th I
[2:46] got home and
[2:49] um my husband at that time was gone
[2:50] Furniture was gone and we walked in
[2:53] Michael and I I remember Michael saying
[2:55] mommy all our stuff is gone and
[2:59] um and then things just started
[3:00] happening from them I mean eight months
[3:02] pregnant the first thing that came into
[3:04] my mind is oh my gosh where are people
[3:06] gonna sit when they come to see
[3:11] if I thought
[3:12] and at that point I had a choice to make
[3:15] I could either just fall apart
[3:17] emotionally physically spiritually
[3:19] or I could get up
[3:21] and really you know go on with the Lord
[3:24] the Lord strengthening me and so that's
[3:27] the path I took right and then I went
[3:30] out hobbled to the furniture stores you
[3:32] know got the couches and I remember one
[3:34] thing brother they always told me it's
[3:36] like stay in church stay in church and
[3:38] that's what I've always strived to do so
[3:40] 20 years ago today
[3:42] um I was at home the baby hadn't come
[3:44] was supposed to come January 31st and so
[3:47] I said you know what since the baby's
[3:49] not coming let me do my taxes
[3:50] and I guess that's what brought on the
[3:52] labor it's about
[3:54] about nine ten o'clock I'm doing my
[3:56] taxes the labor comes on and for some
[3:57] reason Michael woke up and I wanted him
[4:00] to be asleep because you know when
[4:01] you're having labor pain they're coming
[4:02] your contractors are coming nobody goes
[4:03] home my mom was at work my dad's at home
[4:05] so I I didn't want to call anybody I'm
[4:07] like okay let me get through the night
[4:08] and Michael comes over you know I'm
[4:10] leaning over breathing Michael's
[4:12] breathing with me I'm like Mike he's not
[4:13] even two yet
[4:15] and I'm like okay I've got to get him
[4:16] asleep because like he can't get through
[4:18] this because I need to do what I need to
[4:20] do and he needs to go stick because I
[4:21] need to get in the bath or something hot
[4:23] water and he's breathing with me I'm
[4:25] like Mike okay so I pretended to sleep
[4:27] through all the pain until he fell to
[4:30] sleep and then the next morning of
[4:31] course my mom came took me to the
[4:33] hospital I didn't want to see a section
[4:34] because I knew it was more recovery time
[4:36] but the Lord took me through it all and
[4:39] at that time brother Dale was preaching
[4:41] Grace as a person I remember that and uh
[4:44] that kept me going and I'm so thankful
[4:46] to God that I'm standing here because
[4:48] y'all don't know what he's brought me
[4:50] through and I am so thankful for him I'm
[4:53] so thankful for a pastor that told me to
[4:55] stay in church no matter where I had to
[4:57] go I had to just keep my candle lid I'm
[4:59] thankful for Michael I'm thankful for
[5:01] Benjamin I'm thankful that we've made it
[5:03] to the big tour with the Lord Jesus as
[5:05] our husband and our father and please
[5:07] continue praying for my ex with there's
[5:09] so many questions right but always pray
[5:11] for your salvation because if somebody
[5:13] you know if that same Spirit came or
[5:15] something somebody you'll probably do
[5:16] the same thing right but God
[5:19] kept us through it on I'm thankful for
[5:21] him

[32:27] grateful to be able to Lord share with
[32:30] the people uh what what they backed and
[32:32] uh the efforts that they that we took
[32:35] down to Nicaragua Lord and we just asked
[32:37] Lord that you'll bless this afternoon
[32:38] Lord and help help me that you'll give
[32:41] me uh Clarity of mind to be able to
[32:43] present things in the order and and
[32:46] remember details of of what we did Grant
[32:50] that Lord we ask in your name amen
[32:54] in First Peter chapter 5 it says be
[32:56] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[32:59] the Devil is a roaring lion walketh
[33:01] about seeking whom he may devour whom
[33:03] resists steadfast in the in the faith
[33:05] knowing that the same afflictions are
[33:07] accomplished in your brethren that are
[33:09] in the world and I got a translation
[33:11] from another another Bible that says
[33:13] remember that your family Believers all
[33:14] over the world is going through the same
[33:16] kind of suffering you are I think that's
[33:18] something that we kind of uh it helps
[33:20] helpful to remember that all around the
[33:23] world whether you got money or don't
[33:24] whether you're in this situation or that
[33:26] we're fighting the same devil we're
[33:28] going through the same same uh battles
[33:30] in our mind and in our spiritual life
[33:33] and uh and and and and but we've got the
[33:36] same God that that has given us his word
[33:39] to overcome in every situation you can
[33:42] be seated before we get started I'm I'm
[33:45] gonna
[33:46] I just want to invite Sister Christine
[33:48] to come on up and share a few things and
[33:51] then we'll
[33:53] yeah that's a little bird
[33:58] are you going to use this all right
[34:05] oh okay gotcha
[34:15] at all
[34:17] I wanted to
[34:19] this was a verse the Sunday that we were
[34:21] gonna get the PCR test
[34:23] and that would determine if we were
[34:25] going to go
[34:26] because Nicaragua required this
[34:29] so it's Proverbs 3 5 6 trust in the Lord
[34:33] with all thine heart and lean not into
[34:35] thy own understanding in all thy ways
[34:38] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[34:40] paths
[34:41] so this trip was a miracle because a
[34:45] week prior was the watch night and
[34:47] shortly after that people were coming up
[34:50] positive
[34:51] with covet
[34:53] so we didn't really we knew we were
[34:55] going to go but then all of these
[34:57] started coming up and so we had to hold
[35:00] a conference between the group
[35:02] that was coming and we were saying if
[35:04] someone comes up positive what are you
[35:07] going to do so we all had that set up
[35:10] and so
[35:11] we got the PCR test we were good to go
[35:15] so we flew out on the 11th
[35:18] we caught well our first flight was
[35:20] delayed and we missed the connecting
[35:22] flight so that meant we had to stay in
[35:25] in Houston for two days
[35:27] and the PCR on Sunday expired which
[35:31] meant we had to take another PCR test
[35:34] and we've already been in the plane from
[35:37] Atlanta to Houston where we're all
[35:39] breathing recycled air from everybody in
[35:42] that plane and you are hearing coughing
[35:44] and everything
[35:45] but at this point
[35:48] at this point
[35:50] God worked out everything in Nicaragua
[35:52] already everything was set up for us
[35:54] they were just waiting for us to get
[35:56] there
[35:57] and so
[35:59] this was this was a quote
[36:02] that pretty much rung in my head and it
[36:05] said
[36:06] this is from Brother Branham and he said
[36:08] and when we are doing Mission work or
[36:11] foreign mission
[36:12] with the word of God
[36:14] we know we're always in the will of God
[36:18] and so
[36:20] we took the test
[36:22] within hours we got that it's negative
[36:24] so we were good to go
[36:26] so finally we got to go and this is just
[36:29] a part of from me personally this is
[36:32] Brother Giovanni and sister Jessica I
[36:35] met her in 2017.
[36:38] they wanted to have kids
[36:41] so we gave her a prayer cloth
[36:44] and you guys could next
[36:48] you guys can just show and so there they
[36:50] are now with
[36:52] Emily
[36:54] when we got back the following year she
[36:56] was just a baby but this is a more
[36:59] closer thing next picture
[37:02] this is Brother Nielsen
[37:05] he was very involved he drove us around
[37:08] a lot and that's his wife's sister Gabby
[37:11] she also got a prayer cloth
[37:14] and then when we got back next picture
[37:17] that's their son Samuel
[37:20] and next picture
[37:22] this is
[37:25] Carlos and Sharon
[37:27] they weren't able to have kids
[37:30] and I specific they dropped us off at
[37:33] the airport
[37:34] and before I got out of the car I just
[37:37] handed her a prayer cloth and I told her
[37:39] you know this is for the desire of your
[37:41] heart whatever it is
[37:43] and I knew what it was so the next
[37:45] picture
[37:47] that's their daughter now she's Nazareth
[37:49] that's her name
[37:52] next you guys can just scroll through
[37:54] the following the next one this is
[37:56] Brother Eliezer and merari they
[38:00] Fisk biologically couldn't have kids
[38:03] and Luis was the one that gave brother
[38:05] eliaser a fur cloth for them and then in
[38:08] the next picture
[38:10] that's where they have the baby
[38:12] so they had a big party for her because
[38:14] she just turned one
[38:16] and the next picture
[38:18] this couple
[38:20] she didn't want any prayer cloth
[38:25] but I said well you can have two
[38:27] and so in the next picture in this last
[38:31] trip they have two girls the younger one
[38:33] is she's five months her name that's
[38:36] Abby the bigger one and the younger one
[38:39] is Tammy
[38:40] so I I think you guys can just scroll
[38:42] through these are more recent pictures
[38:44] next that's Emily now that's Genesis
[38:47] Genesis
[38:48] that some well
[38:50] and then the two the family right there
[38:54] and um
[38:56] in the next picture oh that's NASA dead
[38:58] right there
[38:58] in the next picture
[39:00] the girls Nyla and Jordan I put them to
[39:04] work
[39:06] because and they knew it's a mission
[39:08] trip and they knew they were gonna work
[39:10] so this is at the camp and we were
[39:13] washing
[39:14] because the sisters in the kitchen
[39:16] already knew what they were doing so I
[39:17] didn't want to be in their way but I
[39:19] said I can wash dishes and I got two
[39:21] helpers with me so I got them doing that
[39:24] and so these are the they didn't have
[39:26] enough plates for everybody they didn't
[39:28] have enough cups they didn't have enough
[39:31] um spoons and forks so as people were
[39:34] giving them giving us their use of
[39:37] plates we had to wash them real quick
[39:39] because the second round of people need
[39:42] them so we had to wash them quickly next
[39:46] and so
[39:48] I had to get Jordan I told her say
[39:51] plateau and then they'll just give you
[39:53] their dirty plates so I had her go
[39:55] around and and collect that and the
[39:58] reason the reason I had them do that
[40:00] when whenever we go to a mission trip
[40:02] for me personally is that I wanted to
[40:06] I think my goal is to break the barrier
[40:09] or the perception that these Americans
[40:12] we have to serve them
[40:15] that they're here they're coming here
[40:17] they're from the prophets country
[40:20] and we need to serve them and they give
[40:23] you the best that they can and so it it
[40:26] really shocks them when we're willing to
[40:29] get our hands dirty in those greasy
[40:31] water and in the place that they ate out
[40:34] of it really puts them to shock that
[40:37] somebody from the states is willing to
[40:40] do that for them so I made it a point I
[40:43] always do that but since I had these two
[40:45] girls
[40:46] I said you guys are going to wash dishes
[40:48] today
[40:49] so next
[40:51] this is um maybe you can this is a sink
[40:57] it's a wooden sink
[40:59] and I just wanted to show you
[41:02] but this is for me personally
[41:04] um that's where Jordan and Nyla wash
[41:06] dishes in a sister's house
[41:09] and next I think this is a video
[41:12] oh it's a picture and I think the next
[41:14] one is a video
[41:17] so you have to get water
[41:20] I mean you don't have a faucet right
[41:22] there
[41:24] and the chickens are outside
[41:27] and I wanted to show that that's brother
[41:29] Corey that's all I wanted to show on the
[41:32] next picture
[41:36] and this is the stove
[41:38] that the sister made breakfast out of
[41:40] for us
[41:43] so
[41:45] and I think I don't know if that's the
[41:47] last picture okay this is the one that I
[41:49] wanted to finish off of
[41:52] um I also did want to mention that this
[41:55] trip made me appreciate my girls
[41:57] because it was just like
[42:00] I just let them be I was more worried
[42:03] about Nyla and Jordan
[42:06] they just got so used to it and I really
[42:08] I came back thinking wow they're really
[42:10] used to this and it's just second nature
[42:12] for them but this is the picture I
[42:14] wanted to to leave you guys with because
[42:16] this is disposable spoons and forks
[42:20] and we were washing them
[42:22] because we didn't have enough and
[42:26] I know that it's been more than a year
[42:28] that we've been using this
[42:30] because a lot of them had stains and we
[42:33] had to get rid of the stains and we had
[42:35] to get toothbrushes and scrub it off dip
[42:37] it in you know bleach and stuff and get
[42:39] it out
[42:40] and they didn't have enough
[42:42] and they've been using this over and
[42:44] over and over and you see it in many
[42:46] houses they have plastic spoons and
[42:48] forks they don't throw it away
[42:50] and we reuse that and so it's it's
[42:52] always a humbling experience because I
[42:55] find myself complaining about my kitchen
[42:57] counter and then I go back I go back
[43:00] down there and then you see their
[43:01] kitchen and I come back going I love my
[43:04] kitchen counter
[43:06] that was all I wanted to show you guys
[43:09] I think there's another picture but it's
[43:10] the same thing
[43:29] uh just a word of warning I'm probably
[43:31] not going to go at that speed
[43:34] I'll be honest I took I took so many
[43:36] pictures I took I took over a thousand
[43:38] pictures and I'm not prepared to show
[43:40] them all here but um I do have a lot and
[43:44] I I really wanted to come back and and
[43:47] uh communicate to everybody kind of what
[43:49] we went through and share like uh not
[43:52] just places we preached but just kind of
[43:54] the experience so I have some
[44:06] oh
[44:12] okay I don't know what I did different
[44:13] but we'll all right so um this this is
[44:17] kind of an overview of where we went and
[44:19] um
[44:21] you can see from we went from Atlanta to
[44:23] Houston and uh down to Nicaragua and I'm
[44:27] just going to go through our journey
[44:29] because like Christine said we've got a
[44:31] little testimony and kind of how we got
[44:32] down there and we were sitting there in
[44:34] the Atlanta airport and waiting to to
[44:36] get on our flight and all of a sudden we
[44:38] started seeing news of the FAA grounding
[44:41] flights
[44:42] that um they weren't allowing uh some of
[44:45] some of the planes to take off if if
[44:47] they were still on the ground so you
[44:48] know naturally we started
[44:50] um what's what's going on we we had our
[44:52] our apps open with the to see you know
[44:55] with the the where our flights were and
[44:57] the flight we were about to get on to
[44:59] Houston was on time or I'm sorry the
[45:01] flight that we were from Houston to
[45:03] Nicaragua was on time but the flight we
[45:05] were about to get on to Houston was was
[45:07] delayed uh or
[45:09] yeah that's it was delayed
[45:12] it was delayed so it naturally caused
[45:14] the flight from Houston to uh Nicaragua
[45:18] to be we missed it
[45:20] so we we got on our flight to to Houston
[45:23] and we made it over to Houston and and
[45:25] uh here you can say we were in a
[45:27] three-hour line trying to get all of
[45:29] that straightened out and we began to
[45:30] wonder that's when you know you you
[45:33] start having mind battles what's going
[45:35] on or you know you start wondering if if
[45:38] everything's everything's working
[45:39] according to playing and
[45:41] but you know God has a plan even though
[45:43] sometimes we don't understand it at that
[45:45] moment I've got a picture here we we
[45:47] were so hungry after we we uh it took us
[45:50] that long to get to Houston it was about
[45:51] four o'clock in the afternoon by the
[45:53] time we made it through that line and
[45:54] the girls were like I got to get
[45:56] something to eat so they ran over and
[45:57] got uh got on some food real quick and
[46:00] um you know it makes you think of Romans
[46:02] 8 28 we know all things work together
[46:04] for good then the love of God to them
[46:07] that are who are called according to his
[46:08] purpose so uh you know many times you
[46:11] don't understand what's happening but
[46:12] there is a purpose to everything now we
[46:14] we this is we were sitting there in that
[46:16] in that hotel room watching the
[46:18] Wednesday night service and we happened
[46:19] to go and grab some barbecue and you
[46:22] know we were wondering if this maybe
[46:23] maybe has something to do with why our
[46:25] labor at labor was we met this fellow
[46:26] named Justin and uh got the chance to
[46:29] talk to him at the at the barbecue place
[46:31] and he was just a really great guy and
[46:32] we all got a uh our photograph with him
[46:35] and everything got to spend some time
[46:36] with him
[46:37] but like Christine said there's only one
[46:40] flight to Nicaragua per day
[46:42] and all of us needed to find a seed
[46:44] because you know you can imagine what
[46:46] chaos that would cause if we got to
[46:48] Nicaragua differently and nobody's to be
[46:51] Spanish you got to get through customs
[46:52] and Luis isn't there and
[46:56] Luis Luis was like he was our Pappy
[47:01] he was
[47:03] and Christine Christine Luis and
[47:06] Christine were taken care of us so we
[47:07] were we you know we were all thinking we
[47:09] we need Luis we can't get there without
[47:11] him and then all the covet tests I can't
[47:14] remember how many covet tests we needed
[47:16] to get past positive but or negative but
[47:19] five four five
[47:21] okay I thought there was more than that
[47:22] but that's still a big number
[47:25] um but they all had to come back
[47:26] negative again like Christine said after
[47:29] after all of the being around people and
[47:32] everything so we ended up uh getting on
[47:35] another flight got we got it rescheduled
[47:37] and we got on the flight and made it
[47:40] down to Managua
[47:42] here we are landing and eating Subway in
[47:45] the Managua airport
[47:47] um
[47:49] going through customs
[47:51] and then we met Pastor Nielsen is the uh
[47:55] brother that uh
[47:57] she just put on one of the one of the
[47:58] brothers that she just showed uh he was
[48:01] the one he's the he was a fantastic
[48:02] brother and I saw a bunch of pictures of
[48:04] him but he he was pretty much our tour
[48:07] guide while we went around pretty much
[48:09] everywhere and he was he's such a
[48:11] wonderful brother he just he gave up his
[48:13] time I don't have enough to say positive
[48:16] about this brother he he gave up his
[48:18] time for like a week with us and um with
[48:21] like like brother Louise was sharing
[48:22] some things going on at home and uh he
[48:25] just sacrificed to to be with us and and
[48:28] drive us around and stay in hotels with
[48:30] us and um so we loaded up everything on
[48:32] top of the car and we started driving to
[48:35] Managua to the first church because
[48:37] um as as is normally the case you hit
[48:39] the ground running so we were going to
[48:41] speak at a little church Wednesday night
[48:43] and um
[48:46] I think I've got some videos here
[48:56] you you have fun
[48:58] with those Brothers down there
[49:01] so we ended the first church we went to
[49:03] is I stole like uh Sister Christine some
[49:06] of these pictures from Facebook this is
[49:08] Pastor Melchizedek this is how he spells
[49:10] it on Facebook so uh brother milky
[49:13] um so you can see on the map uh it's
[49:15] right there at the top of Managua
[49:17] managua's um uh
[49:19] well I I can't describe it
[49:23] on the map you you saw the the bigger
[49:26] map earlier
[49:27] but it's right next to the to this Lake
[49:29] here
[49:30] um so This Is Us pulling up to the
[49:33] church and you can see Managua is it's
[49:36] pretty it's different it's a crowded
[49:40] teeming with life I uh I'm sorry for the
[49:43] Bad videography but you can see there's
[49:45] a bus pulling up and all kinds of things
[49:47] going on the street Tire dealerships all
[49:49] around and when we turn the corner you
[49:51] can hear me say is that the church
[49:53] because because I wasn't expecting it to
[49:56] look like there there it is on the left
[49:58] and we just rolled up and
[50:01] you really want to drive oh
[50:10] so that kind of gives you an idea of
[50:13] what it was like so we rolled up in the
[50:15] Melchizedek comes out to meet us and um
[50:18] we greet him and and they're getting the
[50:21] church ready
[50:22] getting everything prepared
[50:24] and we we spoke for them it that that
[50:27] was a a wonderful Icebreaker because
[50:31] um or just to kind of get things started
[50:33] because you could immediately sense that
[50:35] this is such a humble wonderful little
[50:37] group of people and they responded so it
[50:40] honestly astonished me how well they
[50:41] responded to the service you know as I
[50:44] preached my heart out and brother
[50:45] brother Louise was interpreting and um I
[50:48] feel like about probably about half that
[50:50] church came up to the front for prayer
[50:51] and and pastors were coming up and uh
[50:55] that that were visiting and they just
[50:56] had some their brothers brother Bob
[50:58] preached that night I never told him
[51:00] anything about this church I know the
[51:02] history I've preached at this church
[51:04] several times the previous Pastor from
[51:06] this church just passed away in 2020s so
[51:09] this is his son right there who's the
[51:11] pastor now but there were some issues
[51:13] some some things just like any church
[51:15] has but there are some specific issues
[51:16] that have been going on a church split
[51:18] that took place a couple of years ago
[51:20] and brother Bob was hitting some things
[51:22] that he didn't even know anything about
[51:24] so that hence the reason why the people
[51:26] were so impressed they must be God
[51:28] speaking to us so
[51:33] yeah you can see this is Brother Nielsen
[51:35] on the right and brother Melchizedek on
[51:36] the left and then all of us together
[51:39] and there's there's brother Michael
[51:41] everybody loved how tall brother Michael
[51:44] was
[51:48] and I I just want to say you know you
[51:50] when you're with on in another country
[51:52] well this is my first time being another
[51:53] country it sounds I don't want to say
[51:55] like I've done it before
[51:57] but when when you're riding two and a
[52:00] half hours and you don't know where
[52:01] you're going through the countryside and
[52:03] you know you've got a new experience and
[52:05] everything I tell you what it makes a
[52:06] whole a lot of difference with the
[52:08] people that you're with and and being
[52:10] with Louise and Christine and their
[52:12] family and Nyla and Jordan and Michael
[52:14] it just made it the whole experience so
[52:17] much more enjoyable you know we were
[52:18] going through the I think I've got some
[52:21] recordings or videos here somewhere but
[52:23] when you're going through the uh the
[52:24] night and you you know it's it's got a
[52:26] long car ride and everybody starts
[52:28] singing and um it it's it's wonderful
[52:31] and this was just a wonderful group to
[52:33] go with and um like Christine said I'm
[52:36] I'm so proud of the example that our
[52:39] young people show to everybody in
[52:40] Nicaragua this uh everywhere they went
[52:43] they they demonstrated a real Christian
[52:45] character
[52:47] [Applause]
[52:53] so then uh that night right after
[52:55] preaching so we had flown all day we
[52:58] were tired we just preached we had a
[53:00] little let me go back to the food real
[53:02] quick so you can see what they cooked
[53:04] for us this is all uh uh I guess that's
[53:07] that's steak and cheese monkey meat
[53:10] I'm just joking
[53:13] there was a lot of monkey meat jokes
[53:18] and and that's uh I I think that
[53:22] cantaloupe drink and I see that
[53:24] cantaloupe drink because that earned a
[53:25] reputation that was it was good
[53:28] um
[53:30] so then then that night we we drove to
[53:33] from Managua to chennandaga which you
[53:35] can see on the map it's about a two and
[53:37] a half hour ride and I put there in
[53:39] Gringo time and Gringo time was supposed
[53:41] to take two and a half hours and and
[53:43] Nicaragua time who knows
[53:47] who knows when you're gonna get there so
[53:51] he's like we started off and just to
[53:53] kind of share I mean just sharing the
[53:54] experience we we started driving around
[53:56] Managua and um and it just so happened
[53:58] that the person I was sitting to next to
[54:00] on the plane was telling me about all
[54:01] these likes that the I guess the
[54:03] president of Nicaragua's wife had put up
[54:05] in Managua and there was all this
[54:07] controversy about that because it was
[54:09] stealing electricity and stuff so anyway
[54:11] I thought these lights were interesting
[54:12] because of that
[54:14] and uh
[54:15] so
[54:17] um
[54:19] this is what it's like driving around
[54:22] you're going to be tailgating and in the
[54:27] wrong lane
[54:31] so you can hear everybody singing
[54:34] [Music]
[54:35] it's a duplicate video
[54:38] but we we drove around and we ended up
[54:41] going back into Managua to meet somebody
[54:43] and it took us it took us quite a while
[54:45] to get up to shenandiga that's part of
[54:47] the experience it was it was a lot of
[54:49] fun
[54:50] and you can see the streets of Tennessee
[54:52] here it's just uh it's really
[54:54] interesting but we ended up at the hotel
[54:57] and uh I'm sorry the streets of Managua
[55:00] we ended up in chennandaga this is what
[55:01] the little hotel looked like
[55:03] um
[55:04] out in front this the street in front
[55:06] was busy
[55:09] um all kinds of things going on
[55:12] people riding by on bikes it was really
[55:14] interesting how that everywhere you
[55:16] looked there was there was a religious
[55:18] signage like this this Pharmacy named
[55:21] after El Shaddai
[55:23] um people riding buying bikes and horses
[55:26] right in the middle of the street and
[55:27] this is what the shower looked like so
[55:29] you had to
[55:31] turn it to the right to get warm water
[55:33] turned it to the left to get skull and
[55:35] hot water or something like something
[55:36] like that
[55:38] yeah the left is a cold water the right
[55:42] is warm water
[55:44] um and then the in the I'm sorry the
[55:47] middle is warm water and then the the
[55:48] yeah it's warm hot or cold
[55:54] so then uh we went we went we had a day
[55:56] off on Saturday so we went down to Leon
[55:58] I'm gonna just just to save time we're
[56:01] already at three o'clock so I'm gonna
[56:02] kind of skim through some of these
[56:03] pictures
[56:04] but we went to this Catholic church and
[56:06] which was uh Zoe mentioned that in her
[56:08] little testimony that's really
[56:10] interesting seeing some of these just
[56:12] how to uh
[56:15] this is because we had enough they this
[56:17] day brother Nielsen he had to go to
[56:19] Honduras that day to attend the wedding
[56:21] so we kind of had an off day so I said
[56:24] Hey Brother Nielsen why don't you just
[56:25] let me uh use the vehicle that he was
[56:29] driving us around he said sure So we
[56:31] went and drove to Leon which was about
[56:33] 45 minutes from Chinandega very touristy
[56:36] spot very popular city in Nicaragua and
[56:39] so we spent the day there
[56:42] uh and out before we get out of Leon I'm
[56:45] just gonna this is a map of of like part
[56:47] of Leon where we were and you can see
[56:48] this little red dot down there where we
[56:50] uh we're on the left-hand side where we
[56:52] parked the car and so when I got back to
[56:54] the car
[56:56] when I got back to the car that car was
[56:58] parked next to the edge like next to the
[57:00] curb and so I said Louise just pull back
[57:03] so I can get in the car real quick well
[57:05] he pulled back everybody got in the car
[57:06] and and then the door shut and he just
[57:09] pulled off and left me on the street
[57:13] and this is a this is a video of him him
[57:16] riding away around the corner
[57:20] watched him driveway
[57:22] and now if you're if you're in a city
[57:24] like this that where everything looks
[57:26] the same and you see the car and you
[57:28] don't speak Spanish that's a weird
[57:30] feeling
[57:32] I I had to I had to do it it was
[57:36] so Danny I told him I was going to tell
[57:37] on him I was going to tell you
[57:39] it needs to be gotten
[57:43] but that was fun
[57:45] um so then we went on on Sunday we
[57:47] preached for brother uh Manuel Mora
[57:50] that's right
[57:52] so uh brother um
[57:55] brother marlone is a minister brother
[57:57] Nielsen's church and he came and picked
[57:59] us up is that is that right yeah brother
[58:01] brother Madeline
[58:05] so
[58:06] we got the brother do you want to say
[58:08] yeah it was this service it was a joint
[58:11] service it was three churches in in in
[58:13] in in one in one place so the the house
[58:17] was pretty packed and that was just a
[58:19] blessing to see the three churches just
[58:21] coming into you know one Accord and say
[58:24] hey we're here to uh to just uh listen
[58:27] to the word of God
[58:30] yeah they they seem really receptive and
[58:33] uh
[58:34] it's a
[58:36] it seems like a good indicator that they
[58:39] appreciated your message when their
[58:40] Facebook profile has your picture in it
[58:44] so I'm assuming that everything went
[58:46] well
[58:48] but so far I don't think anybody in this
[58:50] church has our has our face our pictures
[58:52] and their Facebook profile
[58:57] but uh yeah they they seemed like they
[59:00] really actually brother brother Manuel
[59:02] just uh actually messaged me on Facebook
[59:04] to tell me how that they're looking
[59:05] forward to me coming back and everything
[59:07] so we we uh we just really had a
[59:10] wonderful time down there and
[59:11] um oh I also want to mention that
[59:13] brother um brother Louise felt inspired
[59:16] after the service this is after after I
[59:18] preached I was taking pictures over
[59:19] there to ask brother Michael up to say a
[59:21] few words and he just did a wonderful
[59:23] job I don't think I unfortunately have a
[59:25] video but I think you put it in the
[59:26] WhatsApp
[59:27] um Christine took a video somewhere yeah
[59:30] so uh we sure appreciate that he
[59:33] represented the church well and uh
[59:35] had a just you spoke on a script I
[59:38] forget what scripture it was but you
[59:39] were speaking on a few things and it was
[59:42] it was wonderful
[59:46] so we sat down and ate after after
[59:48] church
[59:52] just wanted to add that in so much that
[59:54] brother Manuel the pastor asked brother
[59:55] Michael to come and he said come and
[59:58] speak for us and brother Michael said
[59:59] I'm not a preacher and he said but
[1:00:01] Michael said I could teach Sunday school
[1:00:03] he said well just come and do a Sunday
[1:00:05] school lesson then
[1:00:10] now after Sunday afternoon after the
[1:00:12] morning service we um
[1:00:14] well let me go back real quick this this
[1:00:15] is how our luggage went everywhere we
[1:00:17] went on top of the car those those
[1:00:19] luggage racks were really neat
[1:00:21] everywhere you went you're you're look
[1:00:23] and I still unfortunately I still have
[1:00:25] dirt on my iPad from Nicaragua from
[1:00:27] riding around on the top of the car
[1:00:30] but that's how it goes
[1:00:32] um so that afternoon we we went over to
[1:00:35] Mario and Scarlet's home and uh this is
[1:00:38] this is a home that the church actually
[1:00:40] helped to fund so we went over there and
[1:00:42] were fortunate enough to bless enough to
[1:00:45] be able to kind of speak and dedicate
[1:00:47] the
[1:00:48] the home yeah if you all remember a
[1:00:50] couple of years ago brother Dale said
[1:00:53] hey let's build this this this family a
[1:00:55] house
[1:00:55] it was about four thousand dollars this
[1:00:59] is their house and so we I asked brother
[1:01:01] Nielsen that their Pastor I said brother
[1:01:03] Nissan you think it'd be good uh if we
[1:01:05] could go just have a little meeting in
[1:01:07] their house and just dedicate it he said
[1:01:10] that's a wonderful idea brother Luis so
[1:01:12] we went in there and had the dedication
[1:01:14] and brother Bob you know uh said a few
[1:01:16] words and helped dedicate and we all got
[1:01:19] around afterwards and had a prayer
[1:01:21] dedicated the family really every day I
[1:01:24] almost just about to get messages from
[1:01:25] that family just so appreciative of
[1:01:27] their little house uh because the way
[1:01:30] they obtained it it was it was in a
[1:01:31] hardship situation that they had but uh
[1:01:34] they're just very thankful and they send
[1:01:36] their greetings
[1:01:38] and that home has become a little
[1:01:39] blessing because I think they had a
[1:01:41] Minister's meeting and they had they
[1:01:43] were able to uh put up about five or ten
[1:01:46] ministers there and that slept in these
[1:01:47] hammocks
[1:01:49] um
[1:01:50] that went to Brother Nielsen's church
[1:01:51] that or that so that they could attend
[1:01:54] brother Nielsen's Church which is right
[1:01:55] around the corner so this is four
[1:01:58] thousand dollars this is what you can
[1:01:59] get but I mean they use it to the max
[1:02:02] four thousand dollars can go all the way
[1:02:04] can can go a very long way
[1:02:09] so this is this is what you help support
[1:02:18] now um brother Nielsen's I've got a
[1:02:20] little quick video of brother Nelson's
[1:02:22] moms she's got like a little shot where
[1:02:24] people come up with this window and and
[1:02:26] buy things and as a pan quickly around
[1:02:29] you can you can see all the little
[1:02:30] things that she sells that was such a
[1:02:32] neat little setup it's just a real
[1:02:34] humble
[1:02:35] it's actually part of her home and uh
[1:02:38] several people that we visited had kind
[1:02:41] of little setups like this it was really
[1:02:42] interesting
[1:02:45] that they would sell things out of their
[1:02:46] home so we went back to uh towards
[1:02:49] Managua and this is the view at night
[1:02:51] looking over an Overlook down in Managua
[1:02:53] and um so on Sunday night we went we
[1:02:56] spent the night in uh San Jorge Rivas is
[1:02:59] that power Rivas and uh I'm just gonna
[1:03:03] quickly go through some of these just so
[1:03:05] you can kind of get a sense of the
[1:03:06] experience Nielsen's putting a luggage
[1:03:10] back on there and that was in
[1:03:12] preparation to go get on the ferry the
[1:03:14] next morning uh to omitipi
[1:03:17] which is this island that has two
[1:03:19] volcanoes on it
[1:03:21] and that was pretty neat so we loaded up
[1:03:23] we got the car on the ferry
[1:03:26] we loaded everything up and away we went
[1:03:29] um just to save time I've actually
[1:03:30] combined some of the pictures from
[1:03:31] before from going and coming together
[1:03:33] but um
[1:03:37] that was that was an experience seeing
[1:03:39] the volcano get closer and closer and
[1:03:41] it's alive it's an active volcano
[1:03:47] so when we landed you can see there's a
[1:03:50] there was a map on the wall that kind of
[1:03:51] shows where everything is and um Nielsen
[1:03:54] was pointing out here that we were going
[1:03:56] to drive around uh the the big island
[1:03:58] where the big volcano is and go over the
[1:04:01] little middle part and ride around to
[1:04:03] brother Juan's Church down at the at the
[1:04:05] bottom there and so that's what we did
[1:04:09] and you can see there's we we got a
[1:04:11] little vantage point where you can see
[1:04:12] both volcanoes at once the big one in
[1:04:14] the back and the conception isn't that
[1:04:17] the big one in maderas is the one on the
[1:04:19] right
[1:04:21] and that's one of my favorite people in
[1:04:23] that cool picture
[1:04:24] but we stand in front of the volcano
[1:04:35] yeah that was neat
[1:04:50] cows in the road all the roads just went
[1:04:53] went around the volcano so it was just
[1:04:54] going around the circle and then across
[1:04:56] and so so we ended up at brother Juan's
[1:04:59] church just a real envelope Church
[1:05:01] um
[1:05:02] and so this is just walking up to his
[1:05:04] home and um I think Christine showed
[1:05:07] some pictures earlier of how you know
[1:05:09] them preparing food for us
[1:05:12] said and ate with them this is this is
[1:05:15] them Riven Michael about um not drinking
[1:05:17] coffee when they heard he didn't drink
[1:05:19] coffee everything boy
[1:05:20] [Laughter]
[1:05:25] you don't drink coffee and Nicaragua or
[1:05:27] Honduras
[1:05:29] and Michael's the only one really that
[1:05:33] can travel around and look good anywhere
[1:05:36] he goes with a top with a shirt and a
[1:05:37] tie I mean everybody's wearing jeans
[1:05:39] t-shirts and everything Michael was we
[1:05:42] he said we were going to church that
[1:05:43] night but I mean he he knows how to work
[1:05:46] it
[1:05:48] you can see this strange tree that has
[1:05:51] uh you know you've got to be careful
[1:05:52] that you don't put your hand on it to
[1:05:54] rest because it's got spikes on it so
[1:05:58] we had church that night and um another
[1:06:01] wonderful Service uh I I remember
[1:06:05] speaking on several different things and
[1:06:07] then a lot of different people came up
[1:06:08] some of these sisters came up and and
[1:06:11] were asking prayer for specifically
[1:06:13] those those needs like you know kidney
[1:06:16] stones I I don't ever preach on kidney
[1:06:18] stones but I was preaching on kidney
[1:06:19] stones and somebody came up that
[1:06:21] um had a problem with kidney stones and
[1:06:23] then so after after the service
[1:06:25] this is the little road in front of the
[1:06:28] front of the church
[1:06:30] and uh just a quick little background on
[1:06:32] that church is the only Message Church
[1:06:34] in that area and it's only been there
[1:06:38] about 13 years 13 to 15 years it's when
[1:06:41] the brother he was a Pentecostal and
[1:06:43] some brothers from Managua came and
[1:06:45] preached uh taught them the message they
[1:06:48] accepted the message and so it's the
[1:06:51] only little church there you pray for
[1:06:52] these brothers because they they need a
[1:06:54] lot of teaching they need a lot of
[1:06:57] um you know a lot of Bible
[1:06:59] Doctrine type teaching and uh so it was
[1:07:04] wonderful to see them again
[1:07:06] I just I just mentioned this um we
[1:07:09] stopped at this this little restaurant
[1:07:11] uh to to get for everybody to get
[1:07:13] coconut ice cream and this is where I
[1:07:15] was I sat there and I had the
[1:07:16] opportunity to just talk to brother
[1:07:17] Nielsen for a little bit and we started
[1:07:19] somehow we ended up on Daniel 70 weeks
[1:07:21] and uh
[1:07:23] yeah believe it or not and and I started
[1:07:26] he was asking me well what what my view
[1:07:28] is it of it is so we just had a little
[1:07:30] quick quick discussion and he he came
[1:07:33] back with that's exactly how I see it
[1:07:35] there's seven years after the Rapture
[1:07:36] and so I that was that was really
[1:07:38] edifying to see you think you think
[1:07:40] nobody else is believing things the way
[1:07:42] you do but like I said the same God is
[1:07:45] is all around the world and he's leading
[1:07:48] us and and they have less messages
[1:07:50] translated in their languages than than
[1:07:53] we do we have all of them and yet they
[1:07:55] still got that same revelation of Daniel
[1:07:57] 70 weeks
[1:07:59] yeah
[1:08:02] uh so uh Tuesday morning we had
[1:08:05] breakfast at brother Corey's and um you
[1:08:08] can see on the map where where about
[1:08:09] where he is and just a precious little
[1:08:13] brother
[1:08:16] but they they cooked us food on uh on on
[1:08:20] with this setup I I guess it's just fire
[1:08:24] um
[1:08:28] so there's brother Corey
[1:08:31] foreign
[1:08:49] there's another store so they had a
[1:08:51] little store where this little boy was
[1:08:52] coming up to get one diaper
[1:08:54] one diaper at a time
[1:09:01] you can see all the sisters were being
[1:09:05] helpful
[1:09:14] and then one of the brothers went out
[1:09:15] and got coconuts for us I you know it's
[1:09:17] interesting that I think we've all seen
[1:09:19] probably the same coconut tree and
[1:09:22] luis's slide decks but now I got to we
[1:09:26] all got to experience that same thing
[1:09:29] and now we can tell about our experience
[1:09:32] that's that's how it is in the gospel
[1:09:33] sometimes isn't it you somebody else can
[1:09:35] have an experience but when you
[1:09:36] experience it then not you know what
[1:09:39] it's like you know we know where that
[1:09:41] coconut tree is we know how those what
[1:09:44] those coconuts taste like
[1:09:46] we can tell somebody about it
[1:09:49] um water and it was interesting because
[1:09:52] Christine wanted she was like I wanted
[1:09:54] some coconut water didn't tell anybody
[1:09:56] except for the brother Pastor that we
[1:09:58] was there with and he said yeah we could
[1:10:00] get some coconut water here well the
[1:10:02] next day when we visited by the Cory's
[1:10:03] house I don't think he knew but the
[1:10:05] brother said hey you want some coconut
[1:10:07] water
[1:10:08] it's like God knows your heart you know
[1:10:10] your desires and he's got what he right
[1:10:12] there when you need it yes
[1:10:16] so we went around and uh to visit with
[1:10:18] several Believers that uh with Brother
[1:10:22] Juan and brother Nielsen they just kind
[1:10:24] of we just kind of went with them to to
[1:10:26] to tag along really and there was a
[1:10:30] little monkey up on the tree
[1:10:34] doing this thing
[1:10:38] we run around the island and and visited
[1:10:41] with different Believers which was which
[1:10:42] was kind of a neat experience
[1:10:47] um just real quick to show you that that
[1:10:49] night we stayed in this low these are
[1:10:51] the stars in Nicaragua which I was
[1:10:53] really excited about seeing the stars
[1:10:54] and they were they were amazing but this
[1:10:56] little real um little little hotel uh
[1:10:58] there's there's that frog that caused so
[1:11:01] much commotion when we got there it was
[1:11:04] yeah
[1:11:05] it was it was in the I think it was at
[1:11:07] the bathroom or the shower
[1:11:09] yeah it stirred up quite a bit of fuss
[1:11:11] there's a frog in this in the bathroom
[1:11:14] but this is where we stayed and you know
[1:11:16] it was about it was about 90 degrees at
[1:11:18] night no air conditioning nothing to
[1:11:20] cool you off with fans and you know it
[1:11:22] wasn't it wasn't that bad I took a
[1:11:24] picture of the light switch just so you
[1:11:25] can kind of see these style of light
[1:11:28] switches was everywhere
[1:11:30] and uh and late at night I got up about
[1:11:33] four in the morning and and took a
[1:11:35] picture of these Leaf Cutters climbing
[1:11:38] up this tree
[1:11:39] which was neat
[1:11:41] they were tearing that tree up
[1:11:47] so you can see the volcano back in the
[1:11:49] distance
[1:11:51] so Wednesday we uh we got up and we went
[1:11:55] to camp we rode the ferry back and we we
[1:11:57] wound up at camp and
[1:12:03] uh
[1:12:04] Bella was playing in in the in the band
[1:12:07] and uh Nyla and and Michael and
[1:12:10] everybody got to sing some specials I
[1:12:13] don't think I have a video of those but
[1:12:15] they were sure a blessing and um Louise
[1:12:19] was asked to speak Thursday night and
[1:12:21] did a wonderful job speaking on
[1:12:24] Lazarus coming forth from the grave
[1:12:27] and here's an example of some of the
[1:12:29] food we ate
[1:12:32] sitting down with a that was one of the
[1:12:33] highlights of the trip was just being
[1:12:35] able to sit down with some of these
[1:12:36] other ministers that had so many
[1:12:39] experiences there's Zach Wallace and
[1:12:41] brother Paco who's just goes into the
[1:12:43] jungle in that green shirt and and and
[1:12:45] and ministers uh takes the takes the
[1:12:48] gospel deep in the jungle
[1:12:50] um
[1:12:51] they are singing a song
[1:12:59] this Youth Camp had probably I would say
[1:13:02] maybe it was about 250 maybe 300 youth
[1:13:07] and uh
[1:13:10] somewhere around there I was not
[1:13:12] expecting to preach on this trip at all
[1:13:15] I came strictly to interpret for brother
[1:13:18] Bob we had a certain itinerary but when
[1:13:21] you get there the brothers are like how
[1:13:22] are you going to come here and not
[1:13:24] preach
[1:13:25] so they got me to preach at the youth
[1:13:27] camp and uh but we we had a good time
[1:13:30] yeah
[1:13:32] and one of the I just want to show these
[1:13:34] pictures brother Burley was preaching on
[1:13:36] in the mornings and he got brother
[1:13:38] Louise and Christine up there to to kind
[1:13:40] of act out
[1:13:42] um being uh going free at the end at the
[1:13:45] end of The Seven Year release and you
[1:13:47] know Luis he just really hammed it up
[1:13:50] and
[1:13:52] brother Burley said he had never had
[1:13:54] anybody acted out quite like Louise and
[1:13:57] Christine did before so the kids were
[1:14:00] laughing and it was it was a great time
[1:14:06] I took a picture of this little this
[1:14:08] little truck as the kids were leaving
[1:14:10] camp that this little group I believe
[1:14:12] and Louise can keep me honest but they
[1:14:14] were they were going back up into the
[1:14:15] mountains and they there was a little
[1:14:17] sister in the back they had a little
[1:14:18] baby and they were just all cramming
[1:14:20] their luggage into the back and they
[1:14:21] were going to drive hours back up into
[1:14:24] the mountains where their where their
[1:14:25] homes were about six hour drive up up to
[1:14:28] the mountain
[1:14:31] they came that far to get the word
[1:14:34] um
[1:14:35] so Sunday
[1:14:36] um the last I think we left uh
[1:14:40] the girls went home uh Saturday and we
[1:14:44] stayed Sunday to to minister for brother
[1:14:47] Manuel and
[1:14:49] um I this is the Sunday that that me and
[1:14:52] little brother Louise split up
[1:14:54] and he went to preach for brother
[1:14:56] Nielsen while I stayed with brother
[1:14:58] Danny Torres to interpret for me and
[1:15:00] preach for brother Manuel at his church
[1:15:02] in Managua brother Manuel also has a
[1:15:05] little a little out of what do you call
[1:15:07] a Outreach that he that we preached that
[1:15:11] I appreciated in the afternoon but I
[1:15:13] don't have really any good pictures from
[1:15:15] the morning because
[1:15:16] um
[1:15:17] I didn't have a photographer but this is
[1:15:19] just us kind of talking at McDonald's
[1:15:22] this is Brother uh Louise I took a
[1:15:24] picture of him saying uh
[1:15:27] let brother Bob preach
[1:15:31] well the brother Manuel was asking me to
[1:15:34] preach that afternoon at the Outreach
[1:15:36] that I was I was preaching that morning
[1:15:39] in Chinandega which is about two hours
[1:15:41] from from where the Outreach is so I
[1:15:44] told Brother Manuel
[1:15:46] because I really didn't want to preach
[1:15:48] but I and I I said look brother Bob has
[1:15:51] already prepared a sermon for that
[1:15:54] evening so why don't we let him speak
[1:15:56] plus he's our guest Minister and I'll be
[1:15:59] more than glad to interpret for him so I
[1:16:01] was able to uh convince brother Manuel
[1:16:04] yes
[1:16:06] this is what their little church looks
[1:16:07] like and some of the homes this is
[1:16:09] actually where we stayed uh that night
[1:16:11] is over to the left but the little
[1:16:13] churches at Tabernacle gilgal
[1:16:16] um and in the afternoon we preached it
[1:16:19] Monty Tabor which is the little Outreach
[1:16:22] that the church actually uh put money in
[1:16:25] to buy the land
[1:16:26] this this church about two years ago you
[1:16:29] guys helped to pay for this land where
[1:16:32] this little Outreach is at
[1:16:34] so right now they have now officially
[1:16:37] started building the church but that's
[1:16:40] the spot where they're going to build so
[1:16:41] they just have something there temporary
[1:16:47] so that afternoon everybody loaded up we
[1:16:49] had some some good Fellowship got some
[1:16:51] pictures taken and um this we all went
[1:16:56] over to brother Manuel's house and uh
[1:16:57] for the final night and and uh this is
[1:17:00] this is Brother Nielsen's little boy in
[1:17:02] the truck trying to drive
[1:17:05] there's uh their brother and sisters
[1:17:07] whose home we dedicated brother Mario
[1:17:09] sister Scarlett there and uh
[1:17:12] this is this is one of my favorite
[1:17:14] pictures
[1:17:18] this this there was uh so much so much
[1:17:21] talking and laughing and everything it
[1:17:23] honestly felt a lot like Monica's family
[1:17:25] when we when they get together
[1:17:27] um but you can kind of see that uh we we
[1:17:29] slept with a mosquito net over the bed
[1:17:32] um just a real humble home I I propped
[1:17:34] the uh there's a little couple that
[1:17:36] actually gave me their whole home to
[1:17:38] spend the night in
[1:17:40] um
[1:17:41] uh you know it was an awesome experience
[1:17:43] to be able to just uh to be able to
[1:17:46] share their their home
[1:17:47] um but just prop to propped a piece of
[1:17:49] wood up against the door and that was
[1:17:50] the lock
[1:17:55] and I ate a good breakfast that morning
[1:17:57] and then we're getting ready to go off
[1:17:58] to the airport his brother Zachary
[1:18:01] Wallace
[1:18:02] and if you don't if you don't know
[1:18:03] Zachary Wallace he's a wonderful little
[1:18:06] missionary brother he's been to like 15
[1:18:08] different countries um I I really
[1:18:10] cherish the time I got to spend with him
[1:18:12] right in the back of the pickup truck to
[1:18:14] and from camp and he was sharing some
[1:18:16] just amazing stories of of of uh you
[1:18:20] know problems that have been resolved
[1:18:21] down there in Nicaragua and Honduras
[1:18:23] just that were resolved by people loving
[1:18:26] one another and
[1:18:27] um so it's just a wonderful time of
[1:18:29] Fellowship
[1:18:30] so we got all loaded up uh we got
[1:18:32] situated in the airport and flying
[1:18:35] flying out and looked out the window and
[1:18:36] there's one of those volcanoes I don't
[1:18:38] know which one that was there were so
[1:18:39] many volcanoes but it was just a nice
[1:18:41] way to say goodbye
[1:18:42] and back
[1:18:45] back in the States
[1:18:47] so I I want to I just want to close with
[1:18:50] with reading this quote to me this was
[1:18:53] this was truly a life-changing
[1:18:55] experience I I honestly you know I've
[1:18:58] heard a lot of people say well is there
[1:18:59] anything that you uh did you did you
[1:19:01] hate it did you not like it I I I I I
[1:19:05] really can't think of anything negative
[1:19:06] at all about it it was a wonderful trip
[1:19:09] wonderful people it's a wonderful to
[1:19:12] have the opportunity to be able to share
[1:19:14] the gospel with people in another
[1:19:15] country and I I can't say enough for how
[1:19:18] much I appreciate brother Louise and
[1:19:19] Christine for kind of putting all this
[1:19:21] together and inviting all the young
[1:19:23] people along and myself and setting this
[1:19:26] up so that I'd have an opportunity to
[1:19:28] speak at these churches
[1:19:30] um I you know one thing one thing that I
[1:19:33] think kind of escapes us is down there
[1:19:36] you know brother Louise's regard he was
[1:19:38] invited to speak at the camp everybody
[1:19:40] highly regards him and um you know we
[1:19:44] kind of we've kind of got accustomed to
[1:19:46] one another up here but down there he's
[1:19:48] looked upon
[1:19:49] um with great esteem and uh so I just
[1:19:52] certainly appreciate I appreciate their
[1:19:55] love and their their gift to me to be
[1:19:57] able to go and minister to this to these
[1:19:59] people in Nicaragua and Lord willing it
[1:20:01] won't be my last so
[1:20:03] but I I want to close with this quote
[1:20:05] and then we'll turn it over to the wave
[1:20:07] for the communion brother I'm sitting
[1:20:09] that day on Calvary he said he was just
[1:20:11] one man the perfect man he gave his life
[1:20:13] and he made an example for you now what
[1:20:15] must we do now the first thing I want to
[1:20:18] say is Jesus never lived for himself his
[1:20:20] life was spent for others that's
[1:20:22] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[1:20:25] go to church and you do good things
[1:20:26] that's fine but when you live your life
[1:20:28] to yourself you have an eternal life
[1:20:30] eternal life is living for others it
[1:20:33] proved it when it come in the Lamb of
[1:20:34] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:20:36] because he did not live for himself he
[1:20:38] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:20:41] life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:20:43] live for yourself no more you live
[1:20:45] forever others
[1:20:48] God bless you Church
[1:20:50] and we'll stop there by the way
[1:20:53] [Applause]
[1:21:03] appreciate you
[1:21:05] we appreciate these brothers I know a
[1:21:07] lot of you have never been to a foreign
[1:21:08] country but
[1:21:10] it will change your life it'll change
[1:21:12] it'll change your perspective of the
[1:21:13] things that you look at in them and the
[1:21:16] things we take for granted we've all got
[1:21:17] Bibles
[1:21:18] we all got the message
[1:21:20] we all got everything we need and
[1:21:23] sometimes we're a little bit dilatory
[1:21:24] about it them people that's their life
[1:21:28] that's their life
[1:21:30] and and they put their whole life into
[1:21:33] it and makes us ashamed of ourselves
[1:21:35] sometimes that uh that they're given a
[1:21:38] lot less like brother Louise said
[1:21:39] there's only several hundred tapes and
[1:21:42] and books in Spanish
[1:21:44] all these years in Spanish the second
[1:21:47] the second most common language in the
[1:21:49] world and somebody dropped the ball
[1:21:52] should have made every sermon there was
[1:21:55] in Spanish because because it's uh it's
[1:21:57] just horrible that they're so far behind
[1:22:00] they don't have any we have all the
[1:22:01] information we got 1100 sermons we have
[1:22:04] to have no one interpret any of those
[1:22:07] no one
[1:22:08] you can sit and listen to it yourself
[1:22:09] you can sit and talk yourself but when
[1:22:12] you've only got three or four hundred of
[1:22:13] that 1100 you're missing a piece of it
[1:22:16] there's a piece missing somewhere for
[1:22:18] Lewis
[1:22:19] by the way just to give you an example
[1:22:21] of that right now they have about 900
[1:22:24] something messages now okay they were
[1:22:25] not interpreted or translated by voice
[1:22:28] of God only only a certain portion of
[1:22:30] that was maybe a quarter of those yep
[1:22:33] the other ones were translated by
[1:22:35] brothers who I I personally know from
[1:22:37] Venezuela and some other brothers around
[1:22:39] Central South America that were paid by
[1:22:42] Churches here in the states to translate
[1:22:45] those messages and now you find them on
[1:22:47] message Hub and so a lot of them they're
[1:22:49] able to be able to print out books from
[1:22:51] the message Hub in Spanish they got
[1:22:53] about 900 so or so right now give you an
[1:22:56] example of that there's Brothers over
[1:22:57] there just like there is here who are
[1:23:00] against uh are opposed to youth camps as
[1:23:03] well
[1:23:04] um but and so I there was we were
[1:23:06] talking there in the vehicle in one of
[1:23:08] those instances and I pulled up a quote
[1:23:10] where brother Brandon said that he was
[1:23:12] talking about Becky and how he wanted
[1:23:14] Becky to go to that youth camp that
[1:23:16] youth rally down there to receive the
[1:23:18] Holy Ghost yeah and how he was
[1:23:21] encouraging her to go you can go and
[1:23:23] look at it I think it's in 1963 after he
[1:23:26] preached the seals right but and so the
[1:23:29] brothers they said we'd never seen that
[1:23:30] quote before
[1:23:32] and uh and and one of the brothers
[1:23:35] finally found the sermon where it was at
[1:23:37] but they had never seen that quote
[1:23:39] before because it it was so so uh so
[1:23:43] rare to to just find the books you know
[1:23:45] right or the message where it was at so
[1:23:47] it's that's just an example of that yeah
[1:23:52] that's why we're so fortunate because if
[1:23:54] we need an answer we know we just pulled
[1:23:56] it up like I said we don't need an
[1:23:57] interpretation we've already got it but
[1:24:00] they need to have an interpretation they
[1:24:02] need somebody to tell them what it says
[1:24:04] in Spanish so that they can can do can
[1:24:07] uh the same as that never seen that
[1:24:09] quote before
[1:24:10] I never seen the quote about cremation
[1:24:12] until Aaron read it last night
[1:24:15] somebody asked about being cremated and
[1:24:17] brother Aaron if you look up the word
[1:24:20] cremate or cremation brother Brown
[1:24:21] speaks about three or four times on that
[1:24:24] where it doesn't matter you know about
[1:24:26] being it's just a personal preference if
[1:24:27] you want to or not so it just
[1:24:30] accelerates the process the Bible says
[1:24:31] ashes ashes dust to dust so
[1:24:34] it just accelerates a process and it's
[1:24:36] just you know but I'd never seen that
[1:24:38] quote and I had it in English
[1:24:40] so think about something though that
[1:24:42] you're looking for it in Spanish
[1:24:44] and they haven't translated that book
[1:24:46] yet
[1:24:47] they haven't translated that tape it
[1:24:49] stops everything
[1:24:51] because there's no other way unless
[1:24:52] somebody like Luis or somebody says hey
[1:24:54] it says in certain certain message and
[1:24:56] you tell them about it in English and
[1:24:57] then you can send them a quote but we
[1:25:00] just we thank God that we got
[1:25:03] able-bodied ministers that can go
[1:25:04] remember a long time ago brother Dale
[1:25:06] would go a good bit and he'd go to
[1:25:08] Jamaica and he's been to the Philippines
[1:25:10] he's been to
[1:25:11] Brazil and Ireland and different places
[1:25:14] and now we're able and I've been to
[1:25:16] Jamaica 11 times so and a couple of
[1:25:19] times with the Philippines so we're
[1:25:20] getting where we're in the older stage
[1:25:22] and then we got younger guys here and
[1:25:23] that's what God does in the economy of
[1:25:25] God he always has somebody waiting in
[1:25:27] the wings he's always got somebody that
[1:25:29] he can the Next Generation that comes up
[1:25:32] because he's never going to have a gap
[1:25:34] God can't he's not ever going to have a
[1:25:36] gap he's got this thing all laid out
[1:25:37] where there won't be a gap in the
[1:25:39] program and I was thinking this morning
[1:25:42] about brother Louise being here and I
[1:25:44] mean we love brother Louise and we know
[1:25:46] why he's here he's here for the word of
[1:25:47] God but he's also here to help take this
[1:25:50] gospel
[1:25:52] and even interpret somebody else now
[1:25:56] and we've been able to uh what I was
[1:25:58] thinking was this kind of expanded us a
[1:26:00] little bit to where we can have
[1:26:02] ministers here that can't speak English
[1:26:04] that that 10 or 15 years ago before
[1:26:07] brother we started coming to church here
[1:26:09] I'm giving you a rose man whole bouquet
[1:26:11] okay you're welcome one of them big ones
[1:26:14] that go around your neck
[1:26:15] we couldn't have certain people that we
[1:26:17] had before
[1:26:19] we could not we'd have to find an
[1:26:21] interpreter but we have one sitting
[1:26:23] right here and a good one a holy ghost
[1:26:25] film one that knows
[1:26:27] what to do you know what the word of God
[1:26:30] says and then you know then he can
[1:26:33] easily interpret for for brother Bob in
[1:26:36] a different one so we just appreciate
[1:26:37] brother brother brother Louise to be
[1:26:39] able to to to be a part of our family
[1:26:41] and part of the family of God and also
[1:26:44] before we before we finish uh we'll
[1:26:46] stand in and start with the communion
[1:26:48] service
[1:26:50] we're all we always
[1:26:53] have been
[1:26:54] mission-minded
[1:26:58] um now there's a lot of other churches
[1:27:00] that that they have Mission funds
[1:27:02] and and they have take up special
[1:27:04] offerings and we do
[1:27:06] certain times take up special offerings
[1:27:08] but I know like I said before brother
[1:27:11] Bob and brother Louise they're ministers
[1:27:13] here so the church pays for their plane
[1:27:16] ticket to where they need to go but
[1:27:18] there's a lot of other money involved as
[1:27:19] far as having to to get money together
[1:27:21] and and you just don't know how much I
[1:27:24] mean it takes money and you ask brother
[1:27:26] Mike on some of them you know they say
[1:27:28] Hey you know it takes money to live you
[1:27:30] can't uh can't go over there and they
[1:27:31] give you everything all right and then
[1:27:33] you also do like brother Dale he'll take
[1:27:35] a two suitcases full of clothes and come
[1:27:37] back with a clothes on his back
[1:27:38] literally right come back with the
[1:27:41] clothes on his back he'd take two full
[1:27:43] suitcases when he got done he'd take the
[1:27:45] two empties and put one inside the other
[1:27:47] one zip it up and he'd bring it back
[1:27:48] home empty he left all his clothes there
[1:27:51] and that's what you do you give you know
[1:27:53] we we're able to do that and and I
[1:27:56] appreciate brother Dale and all the ones
[1:27:57] that's had anything to do with the the
[1:28:00] church and and judging that we need to
[1:28:02] do Mission work there's a lot of people
[1:28:03] just like bro Louise said about uh youth
[1:28:06] camps there's people in his message is
[1:28:08] not going to send their kids to you camp
[1:28:10] they're not gonna even
[1:28:12] um
[1:28:13] um you know they're not gonna even give
[1:28:15] any money they're going to support them
[1:28:17] at all and we could be the same way in
[1:28:19] Mission work because there's a lot of
[1:28:21] people that don't do Mission work they
[1:28:22] do their own work around there which is
[1:28:24] fine every every church is Sovereign but
[1:28:27] I think brother Dale that he's that he's
[1:28:29] had the foresight
[1:28:31] to look and see that down the road he
[1:28:34] didn't know brother Louise was coming
[1:28:36] but God did
[1:28:39] God did God didn't know brother Dale
[1:28:41] didn't know maybe Bob was coming to be a
[1:28:42] minister God did
[1:28:45] so he put everything in place to where
[1:28:47] now we can send people into these
[1:28:49] foreign countries and be able to not
[1:28:53] burden all of you
[1:28:55] your tiles and offerings
[1:28:57] it goes sure to running in the church
[1:28:59] but it also goes to missionary work
[1:29:01] there's a need you know and a need like
[1:29:04] brother Louise came up here several
[1:29:05] years ago about the house
[1:29:08] we need four thousand dollars you got it
[1:29:11] we can't do that for everybody
[1:29:14] but if we can do our certain part then
[1:29:16] God's gonna get on somebody else's heart
[1:29:18] to do another part
[1:29:19] then God's going to get another church
[1:29:21] to do another part we're not you know
[1:29:23] it's not the full brunt of this church
[1:29:25] you know
[1:29:27] um supporting Nicaragua no we support a
[1:29:29] need
[1:29:30] we have brothers that have a need we
[1:29:33] support a need then another church will
[1:29:35] support another need so that's the way
[1:29:36] God works he works his economy like that
[1:29:39] so don't worry they got their that's a
[1:29:41] nice little building for four thousand
[1:29:42] dollars I mean it's functional and
[1:29:44] they're out of the weather and you were
[1:29:46] able to go dedicate it and see it so go
[1:29:48] ahead
[1:29:53] special I guess shout out to my wife
[1:29:56] because and and really this was her idea
[1:30:00] to do this
[1:30:01] to bring the young people with us it was
[1:30:04] never in my intentions to ever do
[1:30:07] anything like that but uh
[1:30:10] it was a good idea and I think it it was
[1:30:13] it was of the Lord yeah and so in the
[1:30:16] midst yeah yeah
[1:30:19] I appreciate it I appreciate her because
[1:30:21] sometimes these ideas come to Iran and
[1:30:24] in the moment I'm thinking what about
[1:30:26] the logistics and all that you know if
[1:30:29] their parents don't go I'm not going
[1:30:30] their parents got to be but you know
[1:30:33] what these young people that went with
[1:30:34] us either they they behaved that they
[1:30:36] did they they maybe they were felt
[1:30:39] uncomfortable at certain times but they
[1:30:41] didn't show it yeah and uh and so they
[1:30:44] Trek through and I just really
[1:30:46] appreciate their efforts and uh but in
[1:30:49] within the midst of Trent Christine
[1:30:52] trying to deal with the girls and and
[1:30:54] you know and of course you're dealing
[1:30:56] with our daughters as well and and she's
[1:30:59] also dealing with the money as well
[1:31:01] she's managing every every money that
[1:31:04] that you guys gave I put her in charge
[1:31:07] of it because I've got to fellowship and
[1:31:09] be with the other brothers I've got you
[1:31:11] know they want to talk to me and things
[1:31:13] like that so
[1:31:14] she took care of all of that and by by
[1:31:17] God's help we were able to use up just
[1:31:20] about every single thing that you guys
[1:31:22] gave amen and that is our mission and if
[1:31:24] we if we see that we have anything left
[1:31:27] over we just kind of just give it away
[1:31:28] right no matter what we'll see what
[1:31:30] needs are there out there and we would
[1:31:32] say hey this is this is from us just
[1:31:34] take it from a blessing from the Lord so
[1:31:36] don't think one bit that we've taken
[1:31:39] that money and used it for personal
[1:31:40] things no it's stay down there
[1:31:42] absolutely so we just appreciate each
[1:31:44] and every one of you all that gave
[1:31:46] appreciate your offerings God knows who
[1:31:48] that
[1:31:49] one dollar bill or twenty dollar bill
[1:31:51] that you gave or whatever you gave where
[1:31:53] it went to and it blessed someone else
[1:31:56] amen
[1:32:01] what's that we get to the other side
[1:32:02] where all things is made new and
[1:32:04] everything's where he went got to get up
[1:32:05] and go to work or anything and our mind
[1:32:07] is not so cluttered or it won't be
[1:32:09] cluttered we'll have a we'll have a new
[1:32:11] body and we'll have our we'll have our
[1:32:14] senses enlightened somebody's going to
[1:32:16] walk up to you and say hey
[1:32:19] God just spoke to me and told me that
[1:32:21] that twenty dollars you put in the
[1:32:22] collection plate it changed my life
[1:32:24] because I was able with that twenty
[1:32:26] dollars to drive to a camp or drive to a
[1:32:28] service right or not been able to do
[1:32:30] that
[1:32:31] right that will be so you think well I'm
[1:32:33] not doing anything yeah you're doing
[1:32:35] something
[1:32:36] if you do it for God it'll never return
[1:32:38] void if you're doing it for yourself
[1:32:41] but if you'll do it for God and say look
[1:32:43] no no strings attached here take this
[1:32:46] money take it down there if you see a
[1:32:48] need we trust our brothers that if we
[1:32:50] see a need that that needs to be dealt
[1:32:52] with then you deal with it and you just
[1:32:54] go right on and like I said it's not for
[1:32:56] it's not for brother Louise and them to
[1:32:58] go down there and and stay in a
[1:32:59] five-star hotel and and you know get a
[1:33:03] rental car it's got air conditioning no
[1:33:05] we live with the people
[1:33:06] uh when I tell people that I've been in
[1:33:09] Jamaica 11 times because a lot of people
[1:33:10] say yeah we've been to Jamaica they
[1:33:12] stayed at the sandals or they stayed at
[1:33:13] the you know you know brother John you
[1:33:15] know what I'm talking about you know I I
[1:33:17] went to the Philippines well yeah I
[1:33:18] stayed in a five-star Motel no I've
[1:33:20] never stayed in a motel in Jamaica ever
[1:33:23] I did in the Philippines one time but
[1:33:25] not in Jamaica never stay always stay
[1:33:27] with the people and when you stay with
[1:33:28] the people you get a real perspective of
[1:33:31] their day-to-day life first place I
[1:33:33] stayed the first time I went I took a
[1:33:35] bath with a teacup and a bucket of water
[1:33:39] foreign
[1:33:43] and the water was drawn from a cistern
[1:33:46] a common
[1:33:47] Anderson a common place that they made a
[1:33:51] concrete to come down like this and it
[1:33:54] just held rain water you lowered the
[1:33:57] five gallon bucket down you pulled a
[1:33:59] five gallon bucket up and guess what
[1:34:01] what you didn't wash with you drank
[1:34:04] yeah of course you had to heat it with
[1:34:06] you know heated it up but
[1:34:08] but gee what you look that's their
[1:34:10] day-to-day life wash clothes
[1:34:13] man we all we do here in America we just
[1:34:15] push buttons
[1:34:17] no you saw you saw what their dishwasher
[1:34:19] looked like over there it was called
[1:34:21] Jordan and Nyla yeah that's right it was
[1:34:24] a Nyla Edition the Jordan Edition
[1:34:28] but all we do is we Mash Maytag and you
[1:34:30] know we call the repairman as soon as it
[1:34:32] don't work
[1:34:33] they gonna do that
[1:34:35] and to wash their plastic spoons and
[1:34:38] forks and knives
[1:34:40] that blows my mind
[1:34:43] but you know what they wanted that was
[1:34:45] the best they could provide for the
[1:34:46] guests they had
[1:34:48] now some of us would look at you know
[1:34:50] what we do we throw them away right we
[1:34:52] throw them away we never have you ever
[1:34:54] watched a plastic fork or a spoon or a
[1:34:56] knife you have but some people have to
[1:34:58] do it at work do it at work
[1:35:00] bro Joe be careful with the spoons and
[1:35:03] the forks work
[1:35:04] Richard don't use it after Luis uses it
[1:35:08] but we don't think anything about that
[1:35:10] but you know what we got a table I'm a
[1:35:12] or or a a shelf or a drawer full of what
[1:35:16] silverware
[1:35:17] if we need some more guess what we go
[1:35:19] buy some more silverware but they can't
[1:35:21] do that
[1:35:22] and they're just the happiest people
[1:35:24] like Bob I think that's what kind of got
[1:35:25] Bob they're just so happy you think oh
[1:35:27] man I'd be so depressed if I got over
[1:35:29] there and be I know they were happy

[1:36:32] where it's going to go father I pray
[1:36:34] that it will
[1:36:35] as we were saying not return void it
[1:36:37] would accomplish Lord as your scripture
[1:36:39] says they took cloths off of Paul and
[1:36:41] even evil spirits were driven out of
[1:36:43] people because of that Lord I pray in
[1:36:46] the name of the Lord Jesus if where this
[1:36:47] cloth has got to go that it will do what
[1:36:50] he says is supposed to do Lord and
[1:36:51] you'll help this brother Lord that it
[1:36:53] goes to Lord we appreciate Lord the time
[1:36:55] that we have to do this Lord thank you

[1:36:59] pray to you fathers we thank you in
[1:37:01] Jesus name amen
[1:37:03] sorry about that didn't give enough time
[1:37:07] all right

[1:37:13] yes
[1:37:30] Heavenly Father Lord our sister knows
[1:37:31] what's his voice she's seen him many
[1:37:33] times
[1:37:34] Lord I pray in the name of the Lord
[1:37:35] Jesus that wherever it goes Lord that it
[1:37:37] will accomplish what our sister has
[1:37:39] desire in her heart father we pray that
[1:37:41] you would just bless the person this is
[1:37:43] going to also Father in the name of the
[1:37:45] Lord Jesus we pray amen
[1:37:48] amen all right everybody all mine's
[1:37:51] clear now
[1:37:52] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:37:54] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:37:56] saint Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:37:58] he was betrayed took bread
[1:38:00] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:38:02] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:38:04] is broken for you
[1:38:05] this do you in remembrance of me after
[1:38:09] the same manner also he took the cup and
[1:38:11] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:38:13] the New Testament in my blood
[1:38:15] this you do as often as you drink it in
[1:38:17] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:38:20] eat this bread and drink this cup you
[1:38:22] just show the Lord's death
[1:38:23] till he comes wherefore whosoever shall
[1:38:26] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:38:28] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:38:31] body and blood of the Lord
[1:38:33] but let a man examine himself that's why
[1:38:36] we stop that's why we have a word of
[1:38:37] prayer examine yourself Lord forgive me
[1:38:39] of my sins forgive me of doing this
[1:38:41] forgive me a being dilatory this week or
[1:38:43] maybe like brother Brown said if you've
[1:38:45] done something to somebody that you
[1:38:47] can't get to he said go ahead and take
[1:38:49] communion he said but you better make
[1:38:50] that right
[1:38:51] all right when you go make this thing
[1:38:53] right for whatever you need to do but
[1:38:55] let a man examine himself and so they
[1:38:57] need me to let bread and drink of that
[1:38:58] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:39:00] unworldly ethers and drinketh what
[1:39:02] damnation to himself
[1:39:03] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:39:06] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:39:08] among you in many sleep for if we would
[1:39:10] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:39:12] but when we are judged we are chasing of
[1:39:14] the Lord
[1:39:15] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:39:18] world
[1:39:18] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:39:20] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:39:23] If any man hunger let him eat at home
[1:39:25] that you come not together under
[1:39:26] condemnation
[1:39:28] and Paul tells the Corinthians the rest
[1:39:30] he'll set an order
[1:39:31] when he comes let's have a moment of
[1:39:33] Silent prayer
[1:39:35] brother Brown said pray for you Pastor
[1:39:38] pray for yourself
[1:39:40] pray for the church
[1:39:43] pray for this communion that we're about
[1:39:44] to take
[1:39:54] thank you for all things Lord
[1:39:56] thank you for the testimonies that we've
[1:39:58] we've been given lord of the work that's
[1:40:01] being done in another country Lords
[1:40:03] several thousand miles away Lord they
[1:40:05] love you just as much as we do father
[1:40:07] and I pray that we'll be together Lord
[1:40:09] one day we'll be able to sit down and
[1:40:10] talk to each other and realize what a
[1:40:13] wonderful time we had
[1:40:15] going and coming and flights and being
[1:40:19] delayed but all that's a part of the
[1:40:21] economy Lord that's part of you and I
[1:40:23] appreciate I thank you Lord for bringing
[1:40:25] them back safe
[1:40:26] and I pray that you Lord give them a
[1:40:28] desire to go back again father if the
[1:40:31] Lord tarries in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:40:34] the Bible said he took bread and he
[1:40:36] blessed it Lord thank you for this
[1:40:38] breadboard
[1:40:39] it's been made with holy hands it's been
[1:40:41] made and prepared exactly the way you
[1:40:43] told us to a father I pray in the name
[1:40:45] of the Lord Jesus that you Sanctified
[1:40:47] lord of the nursery of our bodies and
[1:40:49] Lord it will Lord see this as your body
[1:40:52] Lord and that we realize that's the
[1:40:55] scripture says Discerning the body of
[1:40:57] the Lord
[1:40:57] it will know exactly what we're doing
[1:40:59] when we take this in Jesus name we pray
[1:41:04] yeah
[1:41:07] foreign
[1:41:26] that was really um when we did it enough
[1:41:28] in the uh Philippines one time and I
[1:41:31] think we did in Jamaica a couple of
[1:41:33] times
[1:41:34] it's really nice to see how they do it
[1:41:35] and how it's pretty much the same but
[1:41:37] they still do some things a little bit
[1:41:39] different and uh
[1:41:42] it's good to see that
[1:41:45] not like the world
[1:41:47] the world just buys all this stuff
[1:41:50] no we've got sisters and brothers they
[1:41:52] take their time to make this all right
[1:41:54] and make it with holy hands
[1:41:57] dear heavenly father thank you for the
[1:41:58] word of the morning
[1:42:00] thank you for this wine
[1:42:01] Lord that it has been made Lord
[1:42:04] and as it gets older it gets better Lord
[1:42:06] and as your word unfolds Lord may it get
[1:42:09] better and better for us Lord sanctify

[1:45:43] you can pray to the Lord yourself right
[1:45:46] there might be a time when you can't
[1:45:48] find a preacher or your pastor or
[1:45:50] somebody to do it you better be on
[1:45:52] speaking terms with a man before you do
[1:45:53] that amen
[1:45:56] that's why you need to pray and read
[1:45:57] your Bible
[1:45:59] and talk to God like
[1:46:01] talk to God like he's your he's your
[1:46:03] friend that's what he is he is your
[1:46:04] friend
[1:46:06] he's your brother he's your dad
[1:46:09] he's a lot of things
[1:46:12] there's one thing for sure he'll never
[1:46:14] leave us or forsake us
[1:46:16] he'll never say I didn't tell you that
[1:46:19] you'll never say no I don't think I want
[1:46:21] to do that anymore yeah he's going to do
[1:46:23] exactly what the Bible says he's going
[1:46:25] to do and he can't change it
[1:46:27] and he won't change it
[1:46:30] thank you brother Ryan
[1:46:31] good to see you up here
[1:46:46] everybody ready all mine's clear
[1:46:50] thank you Lord
[1:46:57] thank you Lord
[1:47:00] Praise Your Name Lord thank you Jesus
[1:47:05] you know some people eating the message
[1:47:07] are not even taking communion anymore
[1:47:08] they said they're just a way above all
[1:47:10] this and they don't have to take
[1:47:11] communion and the Lord's already come
[1:47:13] and
[1:47:14] um
[1:47:15] Jesus said do this till he comes
[1:47:19] and I know they said he come in 1963
[1:47:21] that's their whole pretense well that's
[1:47:24] all right you can believe that if you
[1:47:25] want to but we still need to take
[1:47:27] communion I feel like we need to keep us
[1:47:29] clean keep us keep us alert right right
[1:47:33] um many times you know you've heard a a
[1:47:36] preacher friend of mine he said we the
[1:47:38] old brother said we take communion when
[1:47:40] we feel like everybody's ready Well we'd
[1:47:42] never take communion
[1:47:44] when you feel like everybody's ready
[1:47:47] so we just tell you to get ready the
[1:47:50] first time you've ever month just get
[1:47:51] ready
[1:47:52] and then we take our communion and you
[1:47:54] know what it really helps
[1:47:56] to know why you're taking it not that
[1:47:58] you're just a ritual it's that you're
[1:47:59] taking it because you're responsible for
[1:48:03] the body
[1:48:04] of the Lord which is this right here
[1:48:06] this is the body of the Lord body of the
[1:48:09] Lord somewhere else we know that but the
[1:48:10] spiritual body of the Lord is right here
[1:48:12] it's his bride so Jesus said
[1:48:16] John tells us and supper having ended
[1:48:18] the devil having now put in the heart of
[1:48:20] judas's carrot Simon's son to betray him
[1:48:22] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:48:24] all things into his hands that he was
[1:48:27] come from God and he went to God
[1:48:29] he rises from supper and he laid down
[1:48:31] his garments and took a towel and girded
[1:48:33] himself
[1:48:34] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:48:36] and began to wash his disciples feet
[1:48:38] wow and to wipe them with the tower hole
[1:48:40] with he was girded then cometh he to
[1:48:43] Simon Peter and Peter said Lord thus
[1:48:45] thou washed my feet
[1:48:47] Jesus said unto him what I do thou
[1:48:49] knowest not now but Thou shalt know
[1:48:52] Hereafter Peter sent unto him Thou shalt
[1:48:55] never wash my feet Jesus answers said if
[1:48:58] I wash thee not thou has no part
[1:49:01] with me that's pretty plain
[1:49:03] if you don't do foot washing
[1:49:05] you're not doing all the ordinances of
[1:49:07] God and you have no part with him that's
[1:49:08] what he said Simon Peter said Lord not
[1:49:12] my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:49:14] head
[1:49:15] Jesus said he that is washed and he is
[1:49:16] not saved a wash
[1:49:19] feet but it's clean every wet and you're
[1:49:22] clean but not all for he knew who should
[1:49:25] betray him therefore he said you are not
[1:49:27] all clean so after he had washed their
[1:49:29] feet he'd taken the garments will sit
[1:49:31] down he said know you what I've done to
[1:49:33] you he asked him a question no you're
[1:49:34] not what I've done to you you call me
[1:49:36] master and Lord and you say well for so
[1:49:38] I am
[1:49:39] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:49:41] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:49:43] one another's feet for I have given you
[1:49:45] an example
[1:49:47] the man that created the feet that he
[1:49:50] was washing said you need to wash feet
[1:49:52] right all right
[1:49:54] for I have given you an example that you
[1:49:57] should do as I have done to you verily
[1:49:58] verily I say unto you the servant is not
[1:50:00] greater than his Lord
[1:50:02] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:50:05] that sent him if you know these things
[1:50:08] happy
[1:50:10] or ye if you do them
[1:50:13] happy I always remember brother Tom
[1:50:16] Ernest bless his heart uh and he and he
[1:50:19] would he'd get down to wash your feet
[1:50:20] and he'd look at you and he'd say he
[1:50:22] said it's an honor to wash your feet
[1:50:24] and he really meant
[1:50:26] what he said it was an honor for him to
[1:50:29] wash your feet when we think about that
[1:50:31] or do we think it's just get in line
[1:50:32] watch your feet and leave no you're
[1:50:35] washing the feet of the Lord
[1:50:38] you're washing the feet of the Lord
[1:50:40] until the Lord comes in his physical
[1:50:42] body
[1:50:44] so you're doing what God Said to do as
[1:50:46] an ordinance to keep us clean to keep us
[1:50:49] to where we are doing what God told us
