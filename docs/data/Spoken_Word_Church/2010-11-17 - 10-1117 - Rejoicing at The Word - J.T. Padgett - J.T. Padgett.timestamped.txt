[31:53] open them up to Psalms 119 and we're
[31:56] going to just look right there tonight
[31:58] for a little Foundation we'll start with
[32:01] tonight and just trust that something
[32:03] could be said tonight that will maybe be
[32:05] edifying or uplifting or help you some
[32:08] way as we walk in life amen there's uh
[32:11] uh I was just thinking the other day we
[32:13] was uh somewhere in a service and I got
[32:16] to my mind just kind of got to think
[32:18] about that uh you know it's so easy
[32:21] today to find fault or criticism or get
[32:26] uh you know bitter taste about things
[32:29] the way things are going and do you know
[32:32] and and and even as a Christian you know
[32:34] we have problem we have to watch out for
[32:36] that because we get bitterness in our
[32:38] heart because the way things are going
[32:40] but you know I read in the word where
[32:41] said all things work together for good
[32:44] to them that love God Amen all things
[32:48] work together praise the Lord so amen
[32:51] when I think about that then it changes
[32:53] everything else praise God but David was
[32:56] writing to us and Psalms 119 and verse
[33:01] 162 and we just kind of like to look at
[33:03] this little thought tonight David said I
[33:06] Rejoice at Thy
[33:10] word I Rejoice at Thy word you know
[33:16] there's so many things today we could
[33:18] think about that people love to get
[33:20] excited about but David found something
[33:23] that's Eternal of Eternal value he felt
[33:26] something that would be there when
[33:28] everything else was gone he found
[33:31] something that could stand in a position
[33:33] where all of his friends could forsake
[33:35] Him but there's always this would always
[33:37] be there that is the word of God Amen
[33:41] brothers and sisters and David said I
[33:43] Rejoice at Thy word as one that findeth
[33:45] great spoil Heavenly Father tonight dear
[33:48] God as we come to your throne of grace
[33:51] and mercy Lord it so good to see all

[35:55] without money and without arms conquered
[35:58] more Millions than Alexander the Great
[36:01] or Caesar or Mohammad or Napoleon
[36:05] without science and learning he shed
[36:08] more light on things human and divine
[36:10] than all the philosophers and the
[36:12] scholars combined without the eloquence
[36:15] of school he spoke such words of life as
[36:19] were never spoken before or S and
[36:22] produced effects which lie beyond the
[36:24] reach of an orator or a poet and with
[36:27] writing a single line he set more pens
[36:30] in motion and furnished more things for
[36:33] more sermons and orientations and
[36:36] discussions and learned volumes and
[36:39] works of art and songs of praise than
[36:41] the whole Army of Great Men of ancient
[36:45] and modern times what about that never
[36:48] even went 200 miles away from his
[36:50] birthplace and yet today Amen to God

[38:33] he wrote so many things about it he said
[38:36] in Psalms 119 verse 165 he said great
[38:40] peace have they which love thy law the
[38:42] law is a type of the word and nothing
[38:45] shall offend them in other words they'll
[38:47] have no stumbling block amen tonight to
[38:49] be able to open back the word of God
[38:52] Amen to a lot of people they open the
[38:54] word of God and they say well there's
[38:56] there's too many contrad I in the word
[38:58] so you have trouble uh to believe a book
[39:01] like this but you know what every time I
[39:04] open the word of God I've never found a
[39:05] contradiction in it yet praise Lord it
[39:08] depends on how you look at what you're
[39:10] looking at praise the Lord amen with
[39:12] what nine said amen to God somebody said
[39:15] well I find too many faults in it well
[39:17] I'm going to tell you what if you're
[39:19] looking for one you may find one but
[39:20] I've never found the fault yet praise
[39:22] the Lord as pilot said there's no fault
[39:25] in him praise the Lord
[39:28] oh my when people look at us they see
[39:30] all the imperfection but the thing they

[39:35] God what is on the inside what are we
[39:38] tabernacling tonight it's the word of
[39:40] God in our heart praise the Lord amen
[39:43] that can change us amen even change the
[39:46] way we think and the way we look at
[39:47] things am can bring us Amen to God from
[39:50] a place that looks like we' never be
[39:52] able to rise above where we're at ien
[39:55] but yet it would bring us up into a
[39:57] place the Bible say we can sit together
[39:59] in Heavenly places in the Lord Jesus
[40:01] Christ tonight in so much that we can
[40:04] even have the very mind of the Lord
[40:06] Jesus Christ now think like he thinks
[40:09] praise God talk like he talks and walk
[40:11] like he walks praise the Lord God oh my
[40:15] think about the word of God tonight amen
[40:17] there's power in the word amen to God
[40:20] depends on how you look at it though a
[40:23] lot of churches look at the word of God
[40:25] and they say oh you know the days of
[40:27] Miracles were P brother B kept talking
[40:28] about that amen the days of Miracles
[40:31] were P well to them they were
[40:34] P amen I thank God God never let me look
[40:37] at it that way but he let me look at it
[40:39] in another way there's still miracles in
[40:41] the word of God tonight I still believe
[40:43] it can open the blinded eyes tonight I
[40:46] believe it can unstop the death ears
[40:48] tonight I believe it can cause the lame
[40:50] to walk in the blind to see and the
[40:51] death to hear praise the Lord God he
[40:54] improved amen he can still raise from
[40:56] the dead tonight

[41:01] tonight amen to God brother man said he
[41:03] said M he the only one that can put life
[41:06] in the word amen you know if we just
[41:08] take the Bible itself without the Holy
[41:10] Spirit it just becomes a de L to us
[41:14] amen that's what happened to Israel they
[41:16] took the law amen without faith the
[41:19] Bible says in Hebrews chapter 2 they
[41:21] never mix Faith with the word amen to
[41:23] God and it become a dead letter to them
[41:25] and they try amen to off operate with
[41:27] god without faith you cannot operate
[41:30] with god without faith for the Bible say
[41:32] for without faith it is impossible to
[41:35] please God for by faith we understand
[41:38] that the worlds were framed by the word
[41:40] of God not beside but by the word of God
[41:44] hallelujah to God Amen the things that
[41:46] we see tonight were framed by the word
[41:49] of God everything in this buing was
[41:52] framed by the word of God tonight oh my
[41:54] the very Earth we sit and walk upon was
[41:57] framed by the very word of God tonight
[42:00] Hallelujah to God and I said the god
[42:02] that could create the Earth and bring it
[42:04] and hang it in the just hanging out here
[42:06] in open space and for trillions of years

[42:11] that kind of God he's wanting to live in
[42:14] my heart tonight I say Lord open the
[42:17] doors of my heart and come in tonight
[42:19] praise God amen amen the god little song
[42:23] S I think brother dick sang it sometime
[42:25] to Open the Eyes of My Heart Amen
[42:27] brother I want him to open him up real
[42:29] wide brother praise God hallelujah so he
[42:32] can put life into the word tonight amen
[42:34] here I would it be my body he says
[42:36] standing here without a spirit I'd be
[42:39] dead oh It's Only Life can can Quicken
[42:43] this body to move and it's only the holy
[42:46] spirit that can Quicken the word and he
[42:49] is the only one can put it in action
[42:52] praise God oh my that's a really Amen
[42:55] brother I could go to school amen and
[42:57] you know what amen they would do the
[42:59] best they could but you know what they
[43:01] can't put life in the word I can sit
[43:03] under a minister and that Minister can
[43:06] talk about the word he can preach about
[43:08] the word oh he can tell me all the great
[43:11] things but he can't put life in it
[43:13] praise God but there is one who can put
[43:15] life in it tonight and bring life out of
[43:18] it praise God when it comes into our
[43:19] heart to God oh my thank you Lord Jesus
[43:23] tonight oh he said God I me through a
[43:27] seat of his word and there is only one
[43:29] thing that can Quicken the word and that
[43:31] is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to
[43:34] the word praise God oh and he said when
[43:37] the life in the word meets the life in
[43:40] the spirit it produces whatever the seed
[43:43] is praise God Hallelujah to God oh I
[43:46] like that amen he said and as long as
[43:49] you take God at his word and then the
[43:52] word will produce what it's promised to
[43:54] do no wonder David got excited about the
[43:56] word of God when the word fell into his
[43:59] heart he began to pull on that word oh
[44:02] you say well Brother Jay he did this and
[44:04] he did that sure he did a lot of things
[44:06] praise God but there's one thing about
[44:08] it it was something in David's heart
[44:10] that looked beyond all of those things
[44:12] because a lot of times we walk through
[44:15] life and we have our little hangups we
[44:17] have our little things that goes wrong
[44:19] and we begin to look at that and we say
[44:21] oh but could God use somebody like me
[44:23] I'm going tell you what ien God can use
[44:26] anybody that will turn their life around
[44:29] and say Lord here I am as Isaiah said
[44:32] Lord here I am Use Me Lord praise God
[44:35] speak to me Lord God is just looking for
[44:38] a vessel who will yield himself unto him
[44:41] tonight that's what God looking for
[44:43] tonight he just wants us to surrender
[44:46] all that we have unto him praise God
[44:48] that's right Amen to God taking God at
[44:51] his word oh you say now look he said now
[44:54] maybe oh he said maybe you don't believe
[44:56] that that you say well my faith is what
[44:59] you hear a lot of people say what
[45:01] brother I just have a hard time having
[45:04] faith you know what I find out Faith
[45:08] sometimes is coming a mysterious thing
[45:11] because there's times if you ever get
[45:13] your mind off of whatever it is that
[45:15] you're trying to have faith for then
[45:17] you'll get
[45:18] healed because as long as you're looking
[45:21] at the situation it's hard to have
[45:24] faith most every time that God has ever
[45:28] healed my body it's when I got my mind
[45:30] off of it wasn't thinking about it and a
[45:32] lot of times it was in times I wouldn't
[45:34] even think about being there come
[45:38] on yeah because as long as I had the
[45:41] problem going on my mind it was hard to
[45:44] have faith but if I could just get it
[45:46] off my mind get off over here and begin
[45:48] to do something else ien to forget about
[45:51] what it was and next thing you wow what
[45:54] happened to it that's right that's what
[45:56] God likes to
[45:57] he likes to take those situations that
[46:00] we can just get our mind away from it
[46:02] and let him begin to work he said now
[46:04] look he said you say well my faith is
[46:06] weak I wouldn't confess it see don't let
[46:09] the devil know that always say I've got
[46:12] good faith now don't say you've got all
[46:15] faith brother say if you say you got all
[46:17] faith and Comm make you to be prayed for
[46:19] he said there's something wrong because
[46:21] he said if you got all Faith you won't
[46:22] be up here right but say you got good
[46:25] faith nothing wrong with that I've got
[46:28] good faith Brother Jay Hallelujah to God
[46:32] oh my Lord just open up the winter my
[46:35] heart tonight Lord and let be able to
[46:37] absorb that word tonight like that that
[46:39] I've got good faith tonight I believe
[46:42] God with all my heart see don't testify
[46:44] to anything of the devil tonight right
[46:47] no because you know what he wants you to
[46:49] keep your eye on that problem and you
[46:52] know what the more you keep your eye on
[46:54] the problem the bigger the problem get
[46:56] but if you ever get Your Eyes On Christ
[46:58] and and begin to think about Christ then
[47:01] he gets bigger then the problem gets
[47:02] smaller praise God until it's go on HJ
[47:05] to God tonight amen amen praise the Lord
[47:10] rejoicing at the word now listen what
[47:12] David
[47:13] said Psalms 119 verse 130 I like I like
[47:17] these little scriptures maybe it just be
[47:19] a a little a
[47:21] stimula that you want get a little
[47:24] stimulation amen David said the entrance
[47:28] or the opening or the unfolding of thy
[47:31] words and I thought my goodness right
[47:34] that's it think about today now I'm just
[47:36] thinking about brother dick coming over
[47:37] here tonight how much knowledge that God
[47:40] has poured out in this age
[47:43] alone stop think about it just for a
[47:46] minute just just let your minds go and
[47:48] if you've had a lot of things going on
[47:50] today just you know just kind of block
[47:52] it out and just start and F God has
[47:55] opened back so much knowledge out of
[47:59] this word that no other age you young
[48:01] people listen to me cuz I come up in the
[48:03] Pentecostal mov and I know what it was
[48:06] back there when we run the aisles and
[48:08] turn the benches over hello climb the
[48:14] poles people do oh yeah oh
[48:18] yeah sister Pastor sister maybe she want
[48:21] my her sister we was in the Pentecostal
[48:23] Jesus name church one time and we just
[48:25] hadn't heard nothing about really at
[48:27] this
[48:28] time and they had one of them my little
[48:30] youve heard brother B talk about little
[48:32] pot belly stoves over there and that
[48:33] thing was red hot the pipe was hot she
[48:37] went over and grabbed that thing brother
[48:38] and Dan to jig around that
[48:41] dude but brother she' never come to this
[48:44] message
[48:47] yet hello so I know what it was back
[48:51] there we saw God moving anointed amen
[48:55] those were manifest trying to get them
[48:57] to come to the word when the word was
[48:59] preached then they back away from the
[49:02] word we praying for praying for all her
[49:05] family praise God and one day they'll
[49:06] come on and receive the word of the Lord
[49:08] but see what it was am me they had they
[49:11] had all of the manifestation but when
[49:13] the word come come on Amen they had a
[49:16] hang up not just them a lot of people
[49:20] had a a lot of my family had it they
[49:22] still got it mm oh yeah they like to see
[49:27] us if we get rid of this yeah you know
[49:31] cuz we could conform more back to what
[49:34] they think or to
[49:36] be religious I guess you call it but see
[49:39] we're walking in the light and I begin
[49:41] to think about what all God has done in
[49:43] this hour that we're at you takeing
[49:45] brother brother Ernie was just sharing a
[49:48] couple little things over the other day
[49:49] my mind just kept going justification by
[49:52] faith now Luther taught justification by
[49:56] faith
[49:57] I've got his books probably not all of
[50:00] them well Ain got several of them and I
[50:03] read what he talked about justification
[50:05] by the problem is with Luther he
[50:08] couldn't see how you could be justified
[50:11] by faith amen and turn around and be
[50:13] predestinated to do something
[50:16] justification and and and predestination
[50:20] and those things were there there was a
[50:21] lot of conflict in that to their
[50:24] thinking praise God and I thought here
[50:26] we are we can believe predestination we
[50:29] can believe the for knowledge of God we
[50:31] can believe in justification
[50:34] sanctification full restoration of the
[50:36] word no
[50:38] problem they had troubles back there
[50:41] trying to believe you go back and you
[50:43] read a lot of the older brothers that
[50:46] come on like Alexander Campbell and on
[50:48] back and on back through there and and
[50:50] John Knox and all of those they were
[50:52] great men preach great things but to see
[50:56] what we you see right brother right we
[51:01] have had a a such a such an old into the
[51:04] very Mind Of God we can realize today
[51:08] that we were actually with God in God as
[51:11] a very thought in his
[51:13] thinking they couldn't see
[51:16] that oh my God we just kind of hitting
[51:19] and missing look like a lot of but we
[51:21] find out that we were with God in God as
[51:25] a very thought and attribute of God that
[51:28] God could bring and bring down here to
[51:30] the earth oh my oh I begin to think
[51:33] about that my goodness gracious am what
[51:36] if I had have saved back after there
[51:38] pente cost running oh we oh yeah brother

[51:49] turning to Banes over right praise God
[51:53] many a time I'm going to go to church
[51:55] and and you know what amen they would
[51:57] get so excited brother the preacher
[51:59] didn't even have time to preach because
[52:00] they had to sing and shout right whoa
[52:05] what was wrong they couldn't see what
[52:07] the word was that's right then the word
[52:10] comes along and says brother that he has
[52:12] been search and resarch on your behalf
[52:15] Plumb back into the very eternity in the
[52:18] mind of God that there is nothing no
[52:22] condemnation against you right where was

[1:28:42] but could not justify us right hello he
[1:28:46] could put them forward but couldn't
[1:28:48] justify right because that guilt when
[1:28:51] The Sinner walked away and then that
[1:28:54] blood had been offered that guilt walked
[1:28:56] out with the guy come on because that
[1:28:59] blood could not Purge his conscience

[1:29:05] remember the things I tell I remember
[1:29:08] the things that I did it couldn't Purge
