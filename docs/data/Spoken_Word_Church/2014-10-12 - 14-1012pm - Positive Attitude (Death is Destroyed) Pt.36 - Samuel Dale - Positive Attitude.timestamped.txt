[2:15] thank
[2:16] you for the hour that you have been you
[2:19] have allowed us to be able to live and
[2:23] to not only to do that but be able to
[2:26] see that this hour that we're living
[2:28] here is a very valuable time and very
[2:32] wonderful part in your word that
[2:35] everything is dependent upon this day
[2:38] and Lord then you've waited all of this
[2:41] time and you've brought it down to where
[2:43] we are and now Quicken to your people
[2:47] the part that we are to play in this of
[2:51] the writing of Thy word because we find
[2:54] ourselves therein and we just ask you to
[2:57] help us and guide us forgive our sins
[3:00] because we know we fail you and just
[3:02] keep us remember the sick among us and
[3:03] touch each one Let Your Love be made
[3:06] manifest we love you and we thank you in
[3:09] Jesus name
[3:11] amen Revelations
[3:15] 20 we'll start reading in verse
[3:22] 11 and I saw a great white Throne now
[3:25] this is not going to be about the white
[3:26] Throne or nothing we're just I'm
[3:28] bringing it to the point where we can
[3:29] get it and I saw a great white throne
[3:32] and I saw and him that sat on it and
[3:35] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[3:38] away and there was found no place for
[3:40] them and I saw the dead small and great
[3:43] stand before God and the books were open
[3:46] and another book was open which is The
[3:48] Book of
[3:48] Life and the dead were judged out of
[3:51] those things which were written in the
[3:54] books according to their works and the
[3:56] Sea gave up the dead which were in them
[3:59] and and death in Hell delivered up the
[4:01] dead which were in them and they were
[4:04] judged every man according to their
[4:06] works and death and hell was cast into
[4:09] the Lake of
[4:11] Fire this is the second death now notice
[4:17] death and we're talking about death
[4:19] being destroyed now so watch it death
[4:22] and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire
[4:25] this is the second death and whosoever
[4:27] was not found written in the book of
[4:30] life was cast into the Lake of Fire you
[4:33] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[4:35] to the reading of the word really
[4:36] enjoyed the the singing
[4:43] and
[4:45] now just to back up a little bit onto
[4:48] what we were talking about this morning
[4:49] and then care I thought
[4:52] on see I
[4:54] believe and have tried to teach to you
[4:57] the best that I could over all of these
[4:59] years years that that there is a word
[5:02] for every age and
[5:04] time but there's a people also to make
[5:07] that Word
[5:08] Alive there's got to be
[5:10] somebody you know to make it manifest
[5:14] all right now each age has been their
[5:17] time and their doings and they've
[5:19] brought it forth done a wonderful job
[5:21] before us
[5:24] and then to see that it's not finished
[5:28] up by just a
[5:30] waiting on certain things to happen or
[5:34] or something to be I've got a quote when
[5:37] we get over into the message a little
[5:38] bit in relation to something like
[5:42] that it's not just our ideas and our
[5:46] thoughts it's not to just say well we
[5:49] believe we're this you know no uh I
[5:54] believe that we must have
[5:58] a personal
[6:00] Revelation to us
[6:04] individually then it will be in this end
[6:06] time will be the only time that you
[6:08] would bring it down to more of a
[6:10] collective form because of what we were
[6:13] talking about this morning of the
[6:16] Resurrection all right and in doing that
[6:19] I believe that somebody is going to have
[6:21] to look at
[6:25] death and not be afraid of it and get
[6:29] away from the fears and the thoughts of
[6:31] what we've all had in our minds of death
[6:34] and doing this and doing that but to
[6:37] look at it and see that it is conquered
[6:42] right it is
[6:44] finished all right remember this morning
[6:47] we were trying to bring out that when
[6:49] the dead raises it is made manifest then
[6:52] that you know Paul is saying death
[6:55] where's you sting grave where's you
[6:57] Victory now he said that when they were
[6:59] fixing to cut his head off right and I
[7:03] believe he saw onto the end of things
[7:07] and you know by spiritual Revelation he
[7:12] would make that
[7:13] statement of saying don't worry about it
[7:16] cut my head off but death where's your
[7:19] sting grave where's your Victory all
[7:22] right then in doing that then he was
[7:24] looking at death
[7:27] and just saying
[7:30] it's my helper at this time you know we
[7:34] we've always taught and believed that
[7:36] those back there you know they speak of
[7:38] a personal that's true it was
[7:41] personal but yet Paul kept telling us
[7:44] that it' have to be a falling
[7:47] away it have to be a time it would go
[7:49] beyond there and he was getting it out
[7:52] of the people's mind that the Lord was
[7:54] coming right then when we thought that
[7:58] he was talking about it being right
[7:59] there just in a few minutes I finish
[8:01] this sermon it's going to be here you
[8:03] know no because he was looking by
[8:06] spiritual Revelation down to the end
[8:09] time to see what would be
[8:12] here and and as I said now how much more
[8:15] closer could you get than to be able to
[8:19] stand here see the dead
[8:23] raised and then you know that these
[8:26] bodies are deteriorating in and going
[8:29] away but yet you would look at at it and
[8:33] say death where's your sting grave where
[8:36] is your Victory and you're still dying
[8:38] that's right go 30 40 days right that's
[8:42] right but what did I say this morning
[8:45] when you see that dead raised and
[8:47] realize what's happened I believe you'll
[8:50] be as close to Eternity as you could
[8:52] ever
[8:53] be I remember years ago some of you
[8:56] probably remember it in the seal message
[8:59] message I made a statement that I still
[9:01] believe I said when that seventh seal is
[9:04] revealed to you of the coming of the
[9:08] Lord you are already
[9:12] redeemed you're just
[9:14] waiting the Redemption plan to me be
[9:18] fulfilled because you see it by
[9:20] spiritual Revelation all right we'll
[9:23] look at death and just say death forget
[9:27] it because you're not going to get us
[9:30] anymore it's finished I believe that and
[9:33] for a while there see that's why that
[9:36] I'm so different I guess than other
[9:38] people of I'm not trying to get things
[9:40] together in a matched form to satisfy
[9:43] people in their minds as to what I
[9:46] believe but I believe we're going to
[9:48] have 30 40 days with the dead here Among
[9:50] Us well brother Brandon will be here
[9:52] with us 340 days he can do a lot of
[9:55] preaching during that time all right but
[9:58] remember redemption's
[10:00] over why because when the dead rais
[10:03] redemption's finished all right then
[10:07] that way we can have a glorious time for
[10:10] that period of
[10:11] time I'm not looking for for something
[10:15] to take place to to try to bring us to
[10:18] Revelation right I believe we have the
[10:21] Revelation by way of the profit of what
[10:24] we have need of but I believe we must
[10:27] walk into that amen and to be able then
[10:30] to be happy in what's going on and see
[10:34] then death will one day be destroyed
[10:37] because what was our point this morning
[10:39] I didn't get to the message part because
[10:42] I was dealt with the resurrection so
[10:44] much but see death is
[10:52] unbelief what caused the first physical
[10:54] death in the
[10:56] garden was a spiritual death in an
[10:59] individual that's right right right to
[11:03] disbelieve God and what was the thing
[11:05] brother brownon said she disbelieved
[11:07] Hebrews
[11:08] 138 not that there was not a God she
[11:12] believed in that right but that he
[11:15] wouldn't keep his
[11:18] word all right we were talking the other
[11:20] day my wife and I about you know the
[11:22] scripture that says people will say you
[11:24] know uh he delayeth his coming Etc but
[11:28] the script there
[11:30] says that that is the very people that
[11:32] says
[11:34] that is the time that that will take
[11:37] place that he won't be delaying his
[11:40] coming so you look around the world
[11:42] today and see what they're doing you
[11:44] know everybody's just going along
[11:47] rolling with a tide I guess you call it
[11:50] but somebody's going to wake up one
[11:55] day and say this is it that's right amen
[11:59] that's right right but it'll only be
[12:04] now when it's revealed that's right it's
[12:07] not a quote as I saying there the other
[12:09] day the brother you know what I told
[12:11] about he he'd said he heard brother Bram
[12:13] say it and he got up I take every spirit
[12:15] in here and under my control I thought
[12:18] well good
[12:22] quote I didn't believe it was made
[12:25] manifest but I believe it wasn't brother
[12:27] Bram amen that's right
[12:29] I believe every Spirit was under his
[12:32] control but you see we can make
[12:34] statements because he made a statement
[12:37] that's right we can make statements
[12:39] because the Bible says
[12:41] it you know the Bible says we're
[12:45] everyone healed right amen
[12:48] right
[12:50] already we can prove that by the prophet
[12:54] we can read how that that it's supposed
[12:58] to be something per personal to us but
[13:00] we can also read if it's not made
[13:04] manifest then it's not a
[13:06] revelation I want you to watch that in
[13:08] the message
[13:09] today but just think about
[13:12] it he that believeth not is condemned
[13:17] already you realize then if
[13:22] sin is
[13:25] unbelief
[13:27] then that's why we need to be against is
[13:31] unbelief and if you'll watch it then
[13:33] you'll see why that I've been as I have
[13:35] for all of these years because of being
[13:38] able to see that that I haven't been one
[13:41] that just went along hophazardly
[13:43] preaching and each service we preach
[13:45] against women and their dress and hire
[13:48] and their clothes the men and the world
[13:50] and the the
[13:52] doings you know we've tried to preach
[13:55] the message that's right
[13:57] amen because I believe the Bible and
[14:00] what it says that
[14:03] life and
[14:05] immortality is brought to
[14:07] light by the gospel amen right don't
[14:11] youen all right now but here's a man
[14:14] stand up and say those
[14:16] things Paul said those things change
[14:20] them moment twinkle you know what he was
[14:21] going to the Grave there where you
[14:23] staying gra where going to get his head
[14:25] cut off but yet it was something
[14:28] positive
[14:29] to him that's
[14:32] right see it's got to be positive to you
[14:34] and I that's right I always quote Peter
[14:37] you know I was on the mountain he said
[14:40] with the Lord we said I have a more sure
[14:44] word of Prophecy why cuz he had a new
[14:48] birth all right Luther nobody no telling
[14:52] how many times he preached on a j to
[14:54] live by faith but one day it became a
[14:58] revelation
[14:59] see one day what we've talked about will
[15:02] become a revelation and if you get tired
[15:04] if you're in me talk about it then I
[15:07] know for certain you don't have the
[15:09] Revelation and you should too all right
[15:13] right because I believe and we'll try to
[15:17] prove always have that this
[15:23] message that you and I have has within
[15:27] it
[15:29] now I said it the best way I know to say
[15:32] it the
[15:34] revelation of each age that's ever
[15:38] been the times the
[15:41] things but he got a revelation to you
[15:43] and I that's right something
[15:47] personal to you and I and I believe that
[15:50] if you get tired of hearing me say that
[15:52] I'm sorry you come back you'll hear me
[15:54] say it more times because that's what I
[15:56] believe I've always have all right but
[16:00] now talking about what is death and
[16:04] knowing that death
[16:06] is
[16:08] unbelief the original sin in the garden
[16:12] was Eve's
[16:13] unbelief not in God brother Rand says
[16:17] right but in his
[16:19] word yeah all right now that was death
[16:25] am and see we don't have to go out and
[16:29] do a whole lot of wrong things to be
[16:31] dead while we're
[16:35] living and I tried to explain it this
[16:38] morning that there's two Avenues point
[16:41] there to deal with one is if we haven't
[16:44] had to
[16:46] word then we don't know the word that's
[16:49] right right right but if we've heard the
[16:53] word then we're
[16:56] responsible all right and I I Believe by
[16:59] being the way that I've been I don't
[17:01] think there will be an excuse for you to
[17:05] say we didn't
[17:07] hear the message I'm as honest as I can
[17:10] be about that because it's what I've
[17:12] always tried to do is to make the
[17:14] message available to my wife my children
[17:18] the church to you to where you would
[17:21] have a choice that's
[17:23] right you don't have to go around the
[17:25] country and try to find What doctrine to
[17:28] follow
[17:30] you know I I've tried to be that way
[17:32] because yeah I believe that's what it is
[17:35] I believe to take this message as the
[17:38] people
[17:40] has and turn it the way it's been
[17:45] done is the original
[17:50] death I spent so much time on
[17:53] Resurrection this morning I didn't get
[17:55] on to what I wanted to talk about death
[17:59] see to take this
[18:02] message and disbelieve
[18:05] it once it's made
[18:08] known is the original sin that was in
[18:11] the garden amen that's why this
[18:14] messenger knew what death
[18:17] was what do you think about a man bring
[18:20] a message like he did and
[18:23] realize the people were not getting it
[18:26] right amen
[18:30] how do you think it made him
[18:32] feel in his
[18:36] heart to want the people to see Jesus
[18:38] Christ amen in the correct
[18:42] order but see death has always followed
[18:49] sin all
[18:50] right the scripture speaks of sin and
[18:54] death death always follows sin because
[18:58] sin was the original
[19:02] death Eve was just as
[19:05] dead when she disbelieved God's word am
[19:09] as she was the day she physically died
[19:12] amen that's right the physical death was
[19:15] just a
[19:17] manifestation you know a
[19:19] uh
[19:21] climax bringing it into being she was
[19:25] already
[19:26] dead see that's the way the world is
[19:29] today the world is
[19:32] dead because of the unbelief of God's
[19:36] word it don't take a whole lot of
[19:38] sentence you know to
[19:41] disbelief all you got to do is just say
[19:43] well I don't know whether he meant
[19:46] that I don't know whether that means
[19:50] that that is death that's
[19:53] right I'm not worried about physical
[19:57] dying
[19:58] why would you worry about physical dying
[20:00] that's
[20:01] right well I don't want to leave the
[20:04] world and my family and that's
[20:07] normal that's a normal
[20:10] part that's human beings right that's
[20:16] filio right but a goo love is to say I
[20:20] stay here for my family if I can help
[20:22] them if not Lord I'd like to go on to be
[20:25] with
[20:26] you and
[20:28] then you know we're not the kind to run
[20:31] out and get in front of a train we don't
[20:34] do stuff like that and want to hurry it
[20:38] up but why would you want to hold your
[20:41] loved
[20:42] ones
[20:46] here when they would be passing into a
[20:49] wonderful
[20:51] situation now I'd like to all go
[20:54] together right I mean that's what I'm
[20:58] hoping about a bride all right then
[21:01] we'll all go
[21:02] together but see to disbelieve God's
[21:06] word brought natural death into being
[21:11] right now watch what I'm getting at now
[21:14] this morning to try to get that
[21:18] clear see the eagle was the one that
[21:21] called it
[21:23] death all
[21:24] right now I believe the prophet saw
[21:28] death in its highest form or whatever
[21:31] you want to call it you know right I
[21:34] don't believe he was talking about just
[21:35] physically
[21:37] dying you
[21:38] know that's a normal part that's a
[21:42] natural thing it will take
[21:45] place I believe he was talking about the
[21:49] one thing that God cannot get
[21:54] over okay and what is the one one thing
[21:58] that God cannot get over our
[22:04] unbelief
[22:06] right cuz he can't make you be saved cuz
[22:09] that would bypass his being
[22:13] god well now I believe Paul he made no
[22:16] he
[22:19] didn't we see we think can there's your
[22:24] unbelief but see Eve was dead
[22:29] as the Bible speaks about a woman that
[22:31] liveth in pleasure is dead while she
[22:34] liveth Eve was
[22:37] dead in the worst death of
[22:40] all and
[22:42] lived I don't really know how long she
[22:44] did live 100 years or
[22:47] whatever but it finally took the natural
[22:51] death all
[22:54] right but by the new birth
[23:01] you and I can come to a
[23:03] place to where that that
[23:07] unbelief can be destroyed that's right
[23:11] right CU that's that's what I want to
[23:13] talk about death is
[23:15] destroyed to the Born Again believer
[23:18] death is destroyed right already
[23:23] now it's just not applied in the
[23:25] physical part right that's right all
[23:29] right see then the door of death cannot
[23:32] hinder a born again
[23:34] believer
[23:36] right because it's already
[23:39] settled I can't die right
[23:45] right I can only
[23:48] be helped to cross from
[23:51] natural into the arms of the
[23:54] Lord but I believe somebody is going to
[23:57] stand
[24:00] here and be as we were talking about
[24:02] this
[24:03] morning stand here and I believe she
[24:08] will call the Dead from the
[24:11] ground all
[24:14] right because she's going to be the
[24:16] final voice to the final
[24:18] age and she will call the dead out of
[24:21] the ground one
[24:22] day but it's not because we all get
[24:25] together and decide we're going to do it
[24:27] on a certain day
[24:29] because I'm just as honest as can be we
[24:32] could announce we're going to have it
[24:33] next Sunday and some of you would come
[24:35] up and say I've got something to do next
[24:37] Sunday I won't be able to be here you
[24:40] said but we're talking about the dad
[24:43] being raised you know I
[24:46] mean but I can't be here you going have
[24:49] to make it on another date cuz
[24:52] I'm
[24:53] important yeah about as important as a
[24:57] handful full of
[24:58] dust amen all right but is that
[25:04] true you make it all come to my time and
[25:07] my doings and I I'll agree with you
[25:11] but so I believe somebody is going to
[25:14] stand and look death in the face that's
[25:20] right and then the dead will
[25:26] raise see once you look it in the
[25:29] face and realize that it's
[25:33] finished all right so then if death is
[25:39] unbelief in God's
[25:42] word that's not in God right you follow
[25:46] me yes Eve wouldn't in this she didn't
[25:49] believe you know she believed in God she
[25:51] could prove it was a God
[25:54] right but she doubted his word right all
[25:57] right so if it's unbelief in God's word
[26:01] that kills us would it not simply
[26:05] be as simple as we could talk
[26:09] that the revealed
[26:11] word is what's going to destroy
[26:17] death if the doubting of the word is
[26:21] death what is the
[26:26] opposite
[26:28] you see why we need to hear the
[26:31] message you see why it's so important to
[26:33] study the
[26:34] message for you to study the message not
[26:37] to me to study the message to preach to
[26:41] you that's part of it but it's for
[26:47] you it's not the preacher that's going
[26:50] to make the
[26:52] change it's going to be
[26:55] you as an individual amen all right
[26:59] someone then will have to stand one
[27:03] day and look at death as Peter
[27:07] said and
[27:09] say leave me alone
[27:12] y that's right but it'll be by the
[27:15] revealed word amen amen
[27:19] now there's where we get to
[27:26] meddling if we any thought whatsoever to
[27:30] the
[27:32] message you know me the message is a
[27:35] Bible okay all the Bible and the message
[27:38] is one and we're not into that silliness
[27:40] what he said the White Horse right no
[27:43] we're in
[27:45] the the truth of the message amen all
[27:48] right so
[27:51] then if we could ever come to the place
[27:54] that that can be revealed to us that's
[27:57] right
[27:58] the word of
[27:59] God ex all
[28:03] right now here's my point
[28:07] okay why do we need Daniel 70
[28:14] weeks you know why do we need
[28:18] it that's even the
[28:22] Israel why do we need to Feast to the
[28:26] trumpets you know
[28:28] you remember that
[28:31] one why them trumpets just to
[28:37] Israel why do we
[28:40] need the seals to be revealed
[28:48] brother why do we need marriage and
[28:50] divorce to be
[28:54] preached why do we need one God to be
[28:59] preached yeah brother Dale just no
[29:03] intellect well I've been that for 50
[29:06] years GL on now and you know what that
[29:09] ain't changed me or made me any
[29:11] different I'm still the same
[29:15] person because I know one thing for
[29:18] certain there's one scripture that I
[29:20] firmly
[29:22] believe you know what that scripture
[29:25] is all things you I'm paraphrasing it
[29:28] all things you get you received it
[29:32] that's right that's paraphrasing it but
[29:34] that's the scripture
[29:37] right but yet see we're called an
[29:40] intellectual church or word word word
[29:42] word word
[29:44] church well what are you
[29:50] called I don't believe we need
[29:56] that
[29:59] M I know I'm medling
[30:03] see brother R said on Daniel 70 weeks if
[30:06] you don't understand the Daniel 70 weeks
[30:08] you can't understand the seals the
[30:10] plagues the vows the
[30:13] trumpet now I didn't say that he's the
[30:17] one that said it so if you don't
[30:20] understand Daniel 70 weeks you don't
[30:22] understand the sales that's right amen
[30:25] now I'm sorry that I found that you
[30:31] know I'm sorry that I found that in the
[30:39] message but my point is what is unbelief
[30:43] right that's
[30:46] right if unbelief is
[30:50] death then why would we be so worried
[30:53] about the
[30:54] message I don't want to get into deep
[30:57] things I might get messed up no honey
[31:00] you already messed
[31:05] up we was born messed
[31:09] up
[31:11] right don't worry about getting confused
[31:15] you already are
[31:18] right yeah but that's just old intellect
[31:22] well I asked a
[31:26] question
[31:27] if Einstein said something or
[31:33] if I said
[31:35] it you
[31:37] know would it be value of who was saying
[31:41] it or would it be what was say
[31:48] it does it mean that it would be truer
[31:52] because Einstein said
[31:54] it I get to talking to Aon back there
[31:58] you get into them uh unknown numbers and
[32:02] imaginary numbers and all that stuff
[32:05] that goes with all of that you know that
[32:06] cause them bombs to blow
[32:08] up I just tell them say forget it that's
[32:11] too much Beyond me I know how to turn a
[32:13] wall switch on and I know that that's
[32:16] what they done and they finally wound up
[32:19] one day and throwed the switch and the
[32:20] bomb went off you know took a long time
[32:25] to get all them things together to make
[32:27] make it work but it still was out way it
[32:30] was just from negative to positive and
[32:33] you ever touch the two together you got
[32:35] a
[32:36] problem unless it's word and spirit then
[32:40] you got a wonderful thing all
[32:43] right but how would it be that we could
[32:45] destroy
[32:53] death is for God to reveal the word to
[32:56] us amen
[33:00] right but I just don't have time for
[33:03] them things
[33:06] well where you
[33:08] at you know 24 hours on your clock is 24
[33:13] hours on my clock right you know what I
[33:16] mean by that I don't have time for it
[33:20] right brother Mo preached statue of a
[33:22] perfect man 68 messages I thanks right
[33:25] now and the brother said I ain't got
[33:28] time to listen to 68 messages brother Mo
[33:30] made a good point he said you listen to
[33:33] a lot of other
[33:39] things you
[33:40] see we don't want to call those things
[33:46] unbelief well what is
[33:52] unbelief unbelief is a lack of
[33:55] Revelation right is that simple enough
[33:59] to say
[34:02] it
[34:05] right see to destroy spiritual death and
[34:09] spiritual death is the perverting of
[34:13] God's
[34:15] word are you listening yes spiritual
[34:19] death is the perverting of God's word
[34:23] are making the word say what we think
[34:27] it should
[34:30] say and we had the Daniel 70 weeks
[34:33] doings and wait and I had presented it
[34:36] and we presented two drawings that were
[34:38] authentic drawings of brother
[34:41] brandham and I made the statement I said
[34:43] well if you're going to differ with me
[34:45] at least please do it openly you know
[34:48] don't go around behind my back and talk
[34:50] to everybody tell me sitting here this
[34:52] one brother Saidi want you to know I
[34:54] don't agree with you I said appreciate
[34:55] that
[34:59] so he had the opportunity the next
[35:01] service or it was and he
[35:05] uh he showed why he didn't believe what
[35:07] we were talking
[35:08] about and he made his own drawing
[35:14] yeah he didn't take brother R's drawing
[35:17] to show what was right he made his own
[35:19] drawing until all the ministers said
[35:22] wait a minute
[35:23] brother that's not what brother Ram draw
[35:29] but you see
[35:31] right he made his
[35:37] point you say is that going to take him
[35:39] to the Grave probably
[35:43] will you going take him to hell not
[35:46] necessarily I didn't say
[35:50] that I didn't make that statement I made
[35:54] the statement that it'd probably take
[35:55] him to the Grave
[35:58] cuz I know one thing for certain the
[36:01] people that are standing there at that
[36:03] change is going to be word born people
[36:10] right all right now I may not be able to
[36:14] stand there but at least let me point at
[36:17] it until the day
[36:20] comes because see to destroy spiritual
[36:25] death why did it take for God to send a
[36:34] prophet the Bible
[36:37] always taught one
[36:41] God and we we always believe to have
[36:47] yes why did God after to send the
[36:49] prophet
[36:53] right I thought it was the the way he
[36:55] said it was that we had got so scrupled
[36:58] up until God had to send a
[37:02] prophet have you ever noticed the
[37:04] connection me see if I can get that I'm
[37:07] going to quit writing notes one of these
[37:09] days I don't never use
[37:14] them uh could you pull
[37:17] up Malachi
[37:20] 4 I'll talk a minute while I'll give you
[37:22] a minute to run it up pull up Malachi
[37:25] 4 verse 5 and
[37:28] six have you ever really looked at that
[37:31] scripture as in
[37:33] relationship to this day and to what
[37:37] would take place in this day I mean
[37:39] really just analyzed
[37:43] it and thought on
[37:46] it to see then why God would have to
[37:49] send a
[37:51] prophet and look what it
[37:54] says behold
[37:57] I will send you elij Elijah the prophet
[38:00] the before the coming the great and
[38:02] Dreadful day of the
[38:04] Lord watch what it say and he shall turn
[38:07] the hearts of the fathers to the
[38:09] children and the Heart of the children
[38:10] to their fathers and then we stop there
[38:14] we don't read the rest of
[38:17] it lest I come and smite the Earth with
[38:20] a
[38:21] curse you realize if God had not
[38:24] sent the Adam Bomb
[38:27] was already in the
[38:30] process of being
[38:32] developed all right Einstein was not the
[38:36] first one working on atoms and
[38:39] splittings and
[38:41] doings there were multiple multiple
[38:44] people behind him that once he brought
[38:48] it all he done was took these and put it
[38:52] together and done what they were all
[38:54] aiming
[38:55] at
[39:01] and see
[39:02] church here comes a
[39:06] prophet and said if he didn't
[39:10] come and if he didn't turn the hearts of
[39:13] the children to the fathers and the
[39:15] fathers to the children Etc whatever
[39:18] fathers to the children children to the
[39:20] fathers and he Smite the Earth with a
[39:23] curse what was that
[39:25] curse toal
[39:30] Annihilation had God not kept his word
[39:33] and sent brother random with a
[39:35] message when the atom bombs went off it
[39:38] would have annihilated the whole
[39:43] thing
[39:46] right said if not then he Des Smite the
[39:49] Earth with a
[39:50] curse now back to
[39:54] the bodily part of of
[39:58] us do you realize what would have
[40:00] happened if you annihilated the
[40:03] world you smoke the Earth with a
[40:06] curse uh our bodies come out of
[40:11] there and they would have went with
[40:14] it so there would have been no bodily
[40:17] Redemption
[40:19] right had God not sent a prophet are you
[40:25] listening
[40:26] it would have been annihilated but God
[40:29] kept his word amen all right even though
[40:33] we had all of doubt and
[40:38] frustration but what did it take to
[40:41] bring
[40:46] that it took a
[40:49] man to
[40:52] come that God could speak
[40:55] to
[40:57] and to get rid of his
[41:00] unbelief now is that
[41:03] right brother D we don't believe brother
[41:05] randam ever had any unbelief then you
[41:07] you just you are in Mass confusion
[41:10] because he was the one that said himself
[41:13] that I used to believe Jesus loved me
[41:15] and God hated me and said I till I found
[41:18] out they were the selfs sameed
[41:20] person and he Tau the white horse rider
[41:23] was the Antichrist I mean was the Holy
[41:25] Spirit until the seals broke and he saw
[41:28] it was the Antichrist so that solves a
[41:30] problem but that don't solve the problem
[41:32] in people's mind they just cut you off
[41:33] say forget it he don't understand okay I
[41:38] understand one
[41:42] thing that it takes the revealed
[41:45] word and without the prophet you and I
[41:49] would not have the revealed
[41:51] word I don't care how
[41:54] sanctimonious and wonderful F you think
[41:57] you
[41:59] are and how great revelated you think
[42:03] you are or
[42:07] were the world wasn't waiting on you or
[42:10] me that's
[42:13] right the world was waiting on God to
[42:16] send a prophet that he
[42:20] promised and what would he be doing
[42:25] then now now
[42:29] listen we all used to think that hell
[42:32] was eternal didn't
[42:36] we right
[42:40] right but you know a Prophet come along
[42:43] and he just made a few
[42:46] statements and you know what we don't
[42:48] believe that
[42:52] anymore now do you know what went out of
[42:55] you
[43:02] death well you mean it's death for me to
[43:05] believe in a in Eternal yeah it's death
[43:07] for you to believe anything contrary to
[43:09] the word of me either
[43:12] one that's
[43:17] death we all believe that it was God in
[43:20] three persons Blessed
[43:24] Trinity right
[43:29] how many years did it take a prophet to
[43:31] preach before he could even bring out
[43:33] certain things and he'd say I was
[43:36] waiting on this things or that you
[43:41] know we all believe that we're going to
[43:43] get a new body as we were talking about
[43:45] this
[43:47] morning the prophet says no that's not
[43:50] true we see then why is a big portion of
[43:53] the message still believe in that
[43:55] Doctrine when when the the prophet has
[43:57] brought that out and emphatically stated
[44:02] that do you understand what I'm talking
[44:05] about
[44:07] yes unbelief is anything that is not
[44:12] right in God's word you know about God's
[44:15] word or what we think about
[44:16] it nothing wrong with the word it's what
[44:19] we think about it the word never taught
[44:21] a trinity the word never taught hell as
[44:24] Eternal the word never taught
[44:27] many
[44:28] gods it was never written in there right
[44:32] amen but yet
[44:35] we brought it there and you know what
[44:38] that was
[44:42] death well run down you're just trying
[44:44] to get everybody to believe what you
[44:47] believe okay I'll I I'll go along with
[44:50] you I wish you would believe what I
[44:54] believe
[44:56] that don't exalt me it's just honest
[45:01] truth well you think you're the only
[45:03] one's got it now there's a problem cuz I
[45:06] ain't never done that I've always taught
[45:09] you somewhere around the
[45:12] world is the
[45:15] ministers that are on the word of
[45:18] God right
[45:22] now but I believe that
[45:29] there's a place in there let me get it
[45:30] right now I hope I can get it to the
[45:32] right
[45:33] order brother Brandon preached a message
[45:36] one time and if you listen at it if you
[45:38] go in One Direction you're going to blow
[45:41] your
[45:42] mind he preached a message many time
[45:45] called doors
[45:49] indoors
[45:52] y now if you take that message wrong
[45:56] you have drastically got a
[46:01] problem because he brings doors IND
[46:04] doors he brings you by the new birth in
[46:08] each
[46:12] message as to come
[46:15] inside the soul you know Jesus Christ to
[46:19] come to live he's not talking about
[46:21] justification he's not talking about
[46:23] sanctification he's talking about the
[46:25] new birth
[46:26] the person of Jesus Christ coming and
[46:28] living in our
[46:31] soul now I'm trying to illustrate
[46:37] unbelief and yet he brings it to a place
[46:41] that you're born
[46:43] believer you have eternal life but he
[46:47] says you got doors that are
[46:50] closed right one of them becs the door
[46:54] of my pride
[46:59] but I will challenge you to listen to
[47:01] any of those messages and come out of it
[47:04] where
[47:05] he brings the wrong thing in there they
[47:09] can't be in the doors inside the door
[47:12] one of them that you need to open up and
[47:13] get rid of your adultery or get rid of
[47:16] you lying and you're stealing and you
[47:18] committing this and that and the
[47:21] other bring the message to me if you can
[47:24] find it okay no you'll find him talking
[47:27] about your
[47:28] pride the little things in your
[47:32] life but Brother D when I got born again
[47:36] I I all the evil went out of me
[47:44] okay but why did Peter say that we need
[47:47] to get rid of our
[47:52] Temperance I don't have no temper bless
[47:54] God I got righteous
[47:58] indignation it gets stirred up
[48:01] sometimes and like brother told two
[48:04] brothers the ministers meeting one time
[48:06] and they fussing with each other he said
[48:09] y'all both saying that you're not got a
[48:10] temper
[48:13] that that's the way I act when I get mad
[48:17] is the way y'all been
[48:21] acting but you see once you're born
[48:24] again don't mean you got everything
[48:27] that's
[48:30] right so if we have a problem with a
[48:34] little
[48:35] temper we need to work on
[48:38] that no not an outlandish one you know
[48:42] we're not talking about junk right
[48:44] that's
[48:45] right Pride different things of Our
[48:50] Lives you know what that's killing us
[48:53] that's
[48:54] right well let's God then I'll take care
[48:58] of that I just won't have no more
[49:03] Pride
[49:05] well you're kind of like
[49:08] the story of the tiger that you wet him
[49:12] down real good try to wash off the
[49:14] spots and what
[49:17] happens you just make it
[49:19] shinier so it don't
[49:22] work what is sin unbelief
[49:28] all
[49:29] right to take and preach the
[49:34] message and preach it in certain
[49:38] ways can be just as
[49:41] deadly as preaching the
[49:45] Trinity amen I said in certain ways I
[49:50] didn't
[49:51] say the message was wrong that's right I
[49:55] said is according our preaching of it
[49:57] that's
[49:58] right if you think all the message is is
[50:01] dress and hir and
[50:05] clothes then look what the beautiful
[50:07] part that you've missed of the rest of
[50:10] the understanding and the ability to do
[50:13] away with
[50:14] death I asked brother Mo dur in
[50:17] 1971 when he preached the statue of
[50:19] perfect man finished at about
[50:22] 72 I said
[50:24] okay all I want to know is one thing how
[50:28] do we get those virtues you proved that
[50:31] we not only need them but we got to have
[50:34] them right now I W know how to get rid
[50:37] of
[50:38] them I've been as honest as I can be to
[50:40] talk about somewhere about
[50:46] 1980 the Lord spoke to me about
[50:50] that and he began to show me
[50:54] that don't the only way to get those
[50:56] virtues was for the word being
[51:01] revealed and it statement to me was if
[51:05] you'll have patience with the
[51:08] people it'll prove you got
[51:12] patience is that hard to understand is
[51:15] that do you need a great big light bub
[51:17] he was simply telling me I didn't have
[51:20] patience right and the only way that I'd
[51:23] get it was to have patience with the
[51:25] people
[51:26] and it would all grow
[51:29] together all
[51:31] right doors indoors not horrible sinful
[51:36] things but little
[51:42] things that are there that shouldn't be
[51:45] right left there because of the old
[51:48] adamic nature yeah but not murder
[51:52] adulterous and all of that no just
[51:55] little
[51:57] things that we need to get rid of how do
[52:00] we get rid of
[52:03] it see that's why I love it when the
[52:06] Lord tells you and tells you not only
[52:08] that but tells you the way of
[52:10] it see you can be preaching on Daniel 70
[52:13] weeks and see people get brother Rand
[52:15] preached Daniel 70 weeks and people got
[52:18] healed and got
[52:20] saved you know what brother random
[52:22] preached on Statue of perfect man
[52:25] years later people got saved people got
[52:29] healed you know that brother Randon
[52:31] preached on the
[52:34] seals and people were saved and people
[52:37] were
[52:41] healed but you say well but we need to
[52:43] stay on the simple things to try to get
[52:46] people
[52:47] saved
[52:49] uhuh we need to preach the
[52:53] word I never thought it was simple
[52:56] things and got people saved I understand
[52:59] that I know
[53:01] that I understand but I understand one
[53:07] thing the opening of the
[53:09] word brother brandom what is the new
[53:12] birth Christ Min of God
[53:15] reveal what is the new birth brother
[53:18] brandom it is said it's the revelation
[53:21] of Jesus Christ personally to you
[53:27] right right so then he could be
[53:29] preaching any message souls in
[53:33] prison Feast of the
[53:37] trumpets it seems so
[53:39] confusing to the Ministers of this
[53:42] message but yet he said was thus sayith
[53:45] the Lord you know what people weeping
[53:47] their way to the
[53:51] altar you never save nobody telling them
[53:54] how dirty they
[53:57] are now you may think so but just let it
[54:01] go nobody will ever be saved you telling
[54:04] them how wrong they are that's
[54:10] right why don't you tell them about the
[54:11] love of Jesus
[54:13] Christ why don't you tell them about the
[54:15] one who died on the
[54:19] cross like I've always told you we
[54:21] standing out in the yard one day at my
[54:22] mother-in-laws this lady was standing
[54:24] there with this n I mean he just in up
[54:26] center of the world he got his lawnmower
[54:28] out on Sunday wasn't Christ she said he
[54:31] going to die and go to hell cutting
[54:32] chist on
[54:34] Sunday I thought well that's where we
[54:36] all used to
[54:37] be I didn't condemn her and scream and
[54:40] holler at her I thought that's where we
[54:42] all used to
[54:43] be we all used to be believe there was
[54:47] certain things we done or didn't do is
[54:50] why God saved
[54:51] us I don't care what you say you said no
[54:54] brother de you're right wrong well I'm
[54:55] going to call you a li so we'll solve
[54:58] that cuz we're all human we had some
[55:01] little something right
[55:05] right but see God's goodness the Bible
[55:10] said is what leadeth us to repentance
[55:13] that's
[55:16] right tell them about Jesus Christ and
[55:19] what he
[55:21] done cuz you don't you tell him about it
[55:24] I told you this
[55:25] what cuz I saw it before I ever even
[55:28] come out of organized religion I watch
[55:31] people come out of organized religion
[55:34] because the prophet said
[55:36] it and I watched him a year later going
[55:40] back some of them didn't make it a
[55:43] year you remember some you dealt with
[55:46] some of you were around at the
[55:48] time I made the statement then that I
[55:52] still make now the revelation of Jesus
[55:55] Jesus Christ can save a soul but to tell
[55:58] them organized religion is wrong won't
[56:00] save a
[56:02] soul it's a
[56:04] truth and needs to be
[56:06] done all that's well and
[56:10] good these that know that I talked to
[56:12] them about the message I never talked to
[56:15] them about how bad they were and they
[56:17] needed to be saved I never talked to
[56:19] them how bad organized religion was and
[56:21] they need to get out of it I talked to
[56:24] them about Jesus
[56:27] Christ cuz that's what's going to save
[56:29] all of
[56:30] us are you
[56:32] listening then what's going to take away
[56:34] our unbelief the revealing of God's
[56:41] word right so what's going to destroy
[56:44] death y right the revealing of God's
[56:48] word
[56:49] amen what do ises 1 John 5 and3 said the
[56:53] victory that overcometh the world is
[56:56] what what is the victory that overcometh
[56:58] the
[56:59] world even our
[57:05] faith even our
[57:07] faith so if you want a
[57:12] victory get to
[57:16] Faith
[57:18] right do you understand my
[57:21] point if life and immortality is brought
[57:25] to
[57:27] light second Timothy
[57:30] 1:10 through the
[57:33] gospel then why not preach the
[57:36] gospel
[57:39] right now here is where we're at
[57:44] right not too long ago I heard about a
[57:47] minister saying something and his point
[57:49] was like
[57:52] this we've we know the one God we know
[57:54] know the water baptism we know this and
[57:56] we know
[57:59] that you
[58:01] know what do we
[58:07] need what do we need if we know these
[58:12] things but do we really know those
[58:15] things why do you why does the preachers
[58:17] get
[58:18] upset when you speak about
[58:23] something
[58:26] that they say they already
[58:32] know well I know about the
[58:35] seals well then you just make a few
[58:37] little
[58:41] statements my Point Church is one
[58:46] thing there is nothing can destroy death
[58:50] but the revealed word of God that's
[58:53] right
[58:56] amen there's nothing can do away with
[58:59] sin but the opening of God's
[59:05] word no matter what we think it could
[59:09] be it can't
[59:12] be but just a revealing of God's word
[59:16] but why is the people this message so
[59:18] against the revealing of God's word I've
[59:21] never understood that one I'm
[59:23] sorry
[59:25] we used to years ago people would come
[59:27] and tell brother molon we'd be talking
[59:30] about somebody and they'd say oh he's
[59:31] off the
[59:33] word brother Mo say when you get a
[59:36] chance we going and see
[59:37] him we go
[59:40] listen you know what we found out that
[59:42] the ones they talking about know more
[59:45] about the revealed
[59:47] word you know ones that they were
[59:49] talking about know more about the reveal
[59:51] word than the ones that was doing the
[59:53] talking
[59:57] all
[59:59] right see the first death is the
[1:00:05] death of the Soul
[1:00:08] right now we're going to flip it now
[1:00:13] watch and then the next death is the
[1:00:16] death of the
[1:00:18] body now we made this statement when we
[1:00:21] was an organized
[1:00:22] religion the Baptist was good at it
[1:00:26] they said if you're born
[1:00:30] again you die
[1:00:37] once you remember that one lot of you
[1:00:40] moving your head a little CU you
[1:00:41] remember it but said if you're a sinner
[1:00:44] you die twice
[1:00:47] y Born Again believer can only die one
[1:00:51] time first die to itself and be born
[1:00:55] again the next part of it is he may die
[1:00:59] physically of a natural
[1:01:03] death right but to a sinner one who's
[1:01:07] never saved he
[1:01:10] dies
[1:01:12] physically and you know what he's going
[1:01:14] to die in the second
[1:01:19] death what is the second death brother
[1:01:21] brandham the death of the Soul
[1:01:28] the second death is the death of the
[1:01:30] Soul that's why I read what I did in
[1:01:35] Revelation you realize that if the
[1:01:38] scriptures right
[1:01:41] there that it's not just talking about
[1:01:43] little things but it says death and hell
[1:01:48] right are
[1:01:50] both cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:01:58] so then there's going to be a place
[1:02:00] somewhere that
[1:02:02] death will be totally
[1:02:06] annihilated all
[1:02:08] right now then it reads that
[1:02:12] what whose names were not written and
[1:02:15] all they're going to be cast into the
[1:02:16] Lake of Fire so I got the quotes here if
[1:02:19] you'd like to have them but what is the
[1:02:21] second death is the death of the Soul
[1:02:26] it's not physically
[1:02:32] dying come
[1:02:37] on death and hell is cast into the Lake
[1:02:40] of
[1:02:42] Fire you know the Bible calls the Lake
[1:02:44] of Fire the second death which is the
[1:02:48] second death is
[1:02:50] said you know that's not going to be
[1:02:53] just
[1:02:55] people
[1:02:56] dying that's going to be
[1:03:00] Souls yes and demons and
[1:03:05] Devils CU you know that the devil is
[1:03:07] cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:03:11] right the Lake of Fire is a total
[1:03:15] annihilation of all things not just
[1:03:21] dying it means to do away with demons
[1:03:26] to do away with
[1:03:27] everything ain't going to be no devil in
[1:03:29] heaven he ain't going to get a second
[1:03:32] change that's right so when the Lake of
[1:03:36] Fire is
[1:03:39] finished all death in any form that you
[1:03:43] can use the
[1:03:44] word will be done
[1:03:48] away but to you and
[1:03:53] I
[1:03:56] he that has part in the first
[1:03:57] resurrection over which the second death
[1:03:59] has no part is that
[1:04:02] scripture see the first resurrection is
[1:04:04] the bride of Christ eternal life there's
[1:04:07] no death in that death is already
[1:04:09] annihilated for the
[1:04:12] soul but somebody is going to have to
[1:04:16] walk up to Natural death and say you are
[1:04:22] defeated amen amen
[1:04:29] now you realize what that's going to
[1:04:31] be it's going to be like David when he
[1:04:35] walked out that day and he looked upon
[1:04:37] that
[1:04:38] hill and he
[1:04:42] said
[1:04:45] W he's
[1:04:47] big
[1:04:50] right big old
[1:04:53] thing he said he's bigger than the
[1:04:57] barer he's bigger than the
[1:05:00] lion and said besides that he's
[1:05:03] smart cuz he's a human being what am I
[1:05:06] going to
[1:05:09] do
[1:05:11] right see that's what it looks like to
[1:05:14] you and
[1:05:16] I and that's the reason I bring it out
[1:05:18] the way I
[1:05:19] do you see David looked at that
[1:05:25] Giant and he
[1:05:27] said I don't care how big you
[1:05:30] are he had a positive attitude and he
[1:05:34] had a personal
[1:05:35] revelation now what was David's personal
[1:05:39] revelation he had been anointed to be
[1:05:43] king right by a
[1:05:47] prophet right
[1:05:51] right he wasn't afraid of all of it the
[1:05:54] story is told that he put five stones in
[1:05:56] there brother around use it f a and 54
[1:05:59] Ministry and thing but you know
[1:06:01] according to the story they say Goliath
[1:06:03] had about four more
[1:06:04] Brothers well he probably figured if I
[1:06:07] get him I'll have to get the other four
[1:06:09] so he put Rock in there for each one of
[1:06:12] them he wouldn't
[1:06:14] scared
[1:06:17] why Lord y if you've anointed me to be
[1:06:21] king how can that man
[1:06:24] stand in my way
[1:06:27] amen amen
[1:06:30] right now if what you said is right I'm
[1:06:33] going to be
[1:06:34] king I may die the day
[1:06:37] after
[1:06:39] right but I'm going to sit on that
[1:06:43] Throne I thought that we
[1:06:50] believed that we had been told by
[1:06:54] receiving the new
[1:06:58] birth that we were the
[1:07:00] Christ the little
[1:07:05] Messiah which would be greater having
[1:07:07] the anointing of Nathan I believe it was
[1:07:10] was it which one to
[1:07:13] David are having the inner being of the
[1:07:17] Holy
[1:07:18] Spirit to live in our
[1:07:22] lives and then we afraid of
[1:07:27] dying Brother D why can you preach so
[1:07:31] positive and go on the internet to be
[1:07:34] worldwide and say you see me wrong come
[1:07:37] and tell
[1:07:40] me two motives one is if I'm wrong and
[1:07:43] you come show me I'm going to get
[1:07:46] help but if I'm right you think I'm
[1:07:49] afraid of
[1:07:51] anything no
[1:07:57] there's no enemy can defeat the Bride of
[1:08:01] Jesus
[1:08:03] Christ because to her death is
[1:08:09] destroyed not going to
[1:08:11] be
[1:08:14] right the day you got that new
[1:08:17] birth brother
[1:08:19] Marlo that ended
[1:08:22] death now watch the body may have to go
[1:08:26] by the grave I don't do it cuz you see
[1:08:30] the day he gave you the new birth he
[1:08:32] claimed that body am that you're living
[1:08:35] in yes sir
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:40] right they claimed on it
[1:08:43] sure if David could believe the
[1:08:48] impossible they could not keep him for
[1:08:50] being
[1:08:52] King why can't we
[1:08:55] believe am the impossibility of all
[1:09:00] things that we can walk off of this
[1:09:02] Earth one
[1:09:06] day death is
[1:09:11] destroyed I had the time to go on over
[1:09:13] in Revelation I said vast false prophet
[1:09:16] devil everything is cast into the Lake
[1:09:18] of Fire And even death itself is cast
[1:09:22] into the Lake of Fire according to the
[1:09:23] scripture and you know what that means
[1:09:26] they can't be no eternal hell right
[1:09:31] right because death and hell is going to
[1:09:34] be annihilated that's
[1:09:36] right right anything's annihilated is
[1:09:39] not
[1:09:40] Eternal is that simple
[1:09:43] amen but death
[1:09:46] itself no matter what category you want
[1:09:49] to put it unbelief this that or the
[1:09:52] other when day it'll be totally
[1:09:55] annihilated
[1:09:57] amen but right here before that
[1:10:01] happens some over a thousand years later
[1:10:05] from now even if it was right now
[1:10:08] because you got the Millennium and then
[1:10:10] you got the white
[1:10:13] Throne
[1:10:19] right somebody's going to stand right
[1:10:21] here and say it's
[1:10:22] finished
[1:10:25] well
[1:10:28] now would you agree that death is
[1:10:30] annihilated for the
[1:10:32] Soul by the new birth would you agree
[1:10:35] with
[1:10:36] that would you agree that by being born
[1:10:40] again death has already been destroyed
[1:10:43] in the inner
[1:10:47] being all
[1:10:51] right but see the hard part is is to
[1:10:53] believe that
[1:10:55] death in the physical is destroyed
[1:10:58] that's right to you and I right there is
[1:11:02] where our unbelief is killing us well
[1:11:05] you do brother I don't have no
[1:11:09] unbelief I believe everything brother
[1:11:11] Ram
[1:11:14] said well I remember a group of people
[1:11:18] telling brother brandham said we speak
[1:11:21] only where the Bible speaks
[1:11:25] MH and we don't speak where it don't
[1:11:28] speak he said I doubt
[1:11:32] that he said and where are you said the
[1:11:35] Bible is still speaking but said you're
[1:11:37] in the byone days
[1:11:42] yeah well are we that type of
[1:11:46] people you know what made those people
[1:11:49] that was a human reasoning re
[1:11:54] Revelation did you follow human
[1:11:57] reasoning
[1:11:58] Revelation there's a lot of difference
[1:12:00] between a human reasoning Revelation
[1:12:02] then the Holy Ghost fill
[1:12:05] Revelation Holy Ghost fill Revelation
[1:12:08] you don't have to worry about it you can
[1:12:09] walk on it amen
[1:12:15] right but his brother would be had to
[1:12:18] point you can get him in with a hot
[1:12:21] dog you can get him out with the
[1:12:23] hamburger
[1:12:25] good point wasn't
[1:12:28] it today I'm two Soul tomorrow I'm seven
[1:12:32] Thunder next day I'll be this one I'll
[1:12:34] be that
[1:12:40] one what about
[1:12:42] it has death been destroyed to
[1:12:47] you now I had the scriptures and the
[1:12:51] things but just remember
[1:12:55] I may not see it in the bases that I
[1:12:58] need to see
[1:13:00] it I may not have the comprehension of
[1:13:03] all that I need to
[1:13:07] comprehend but there was a time I didn't
[1:13:09] have this
[1:13:11] comprehension will you go along with
[1:13:14] thaten was there a time that you didn't
[1:13:16] have the comprehension of you being the
[1:13:18] people that would annihilate
[1:13:21] death amen right
[1:13:26] well let me hold on to this until you
[1:13:29] know and then let me be like
[1:13:33] Paul I don't see everything put under
[1:13:37] him I know we're still
[1:13:40] dying but said I see
[1:13:45] Jesus at least let me see
[1:13:52] Jesus amen happy about
[1:13:55] it I'm not running all over the world
[1:13:57] trying to find ever doctrinal issues and
[1:14:00] people and
[1:14:03] doings I generally hear enough without
[1:14:05] even trying to listen to a lot of people
[1:14:07] but the ones that I do talk about I did
[1:14:10] hear and I relate you know I back away
[1:14:13] from talking about doctrinal things that
[1:14:15] I haven't heard somebody say I try to do
[1:14:22] that
[1:14:23] but I've come to find out a little bit
[1:14:25] of what death
[1:14:29] is now don't do us no good to start
[1:14:32] saying I'm not going to get no older I'm
[1:14:35] not going to get no older I'm going to
[1:14:37] be positive I'm going to be positive I'm
[1:14:38] not going to get no
[1:14:40] older you just go ahead and do all you
[1:14:42] want to you're going to get older
[1:14:46] right that's just part of the
[1:14:50] story but to say
[1:14:53] and let's see if you can follow this and
[1:14:55] more
[1:14:56] quick the older I
[1:14:58] get the closer I get to Eternity right
[1:15:05] amen so if it requires problems in
[1:15:11] life I don't glory in my
[1:15:15] problems I just know they're going to
[1:15:19] come I know the older you get the more
[1:15:23] trouble you got if you don't know that
[1:15:26] you're just not old enough
[1:15:31] yet but I don't have to glory in
[1:15:35] that I going to look at that and say hey
[1:15:39] it's what I tell the doctor I said
[1:15:41] Doctor I'm 74 years old what do you
[1:15:43] think I'm supposed to be according to
[1:15:46] your
[1:15:47] books I'm not supposed to be able to
[1:15:51] ride a tractor 68 hours a day
[1:15:53] day build your stands or run around work
[1:15:58] I'm supposed to be getting old and
[1:16:00] slowing
