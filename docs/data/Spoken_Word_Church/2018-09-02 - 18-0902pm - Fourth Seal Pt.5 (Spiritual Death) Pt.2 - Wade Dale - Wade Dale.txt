want to see and then you want to understand him today amen that's why we come to church we didn't come here just to see each other we can do that on Facebook or FaceTime we come see each other in flesh a man need to be in flesh that's a good job that was good thank you good job I told I never heard her same thing before so that she she sang one time when we were going I think so thank you that was a blessing I wish Regina shout like that when I preach but that's okay sly brother Joe Greene said brother Joe Greene said his congregation they watched a video of him in Jamaican and they said well Joseph why don't you preach like that at home he said if you pull like they did I'll preach this like that so I guess if I preach as good as you're saying I'll get it from I'll get them we're gaining I guess hey hey I'm working on it I'm working on it hey you okay over there you okay all the cameras are on you we're good to be in the house with Lord it's just we enjoy singing we really do it's a good singing you know what it comes from the heart that's what I like more than anything is that it comes to my heart and we're the only people as we just talked about in Bible in Sunday school this morning we're the only people that really know where we come from what we're doing here where we're going we're the only people no one has ever understood that sure everybody has had faith and they've believed that God was somewhere and that somehow we're gonna go to heaven no no we had a prophet come and tell us he give us the whole journey of man from the mind of God all the way to the future home so what do we got to fear where's the fear at hey man this should be no fear but good to be in the house of the Lord remember next weekend brother Bob myself will be in Mobile Alabama for the weekend so just remember us and then dad T&M we're going to take a little vacation time and they're going to go out last for a little bit so Lord bless them and also remember put on your calendar October 27th will be our Fall Festival which that'll be a month or so from now but just like this year it'll be just a few weeks or a few days actually this year has just flown by here we already in September that's the time when when we come up to this is the this is the Jewish ending of their civil calendar right in here so so we're we're now of course we don't worry about that but still we watch things and you look and see what's going on because brother Bram always said watch Israel so maybe something will come up out of this month plus this month is heading toward harvest time I like harvest time I like harvest time I like the plant and that's okay but I like the harvest time because that's what we're going to be doing God's gonna harvest us out of this earth one day and we're gonna get out of here amen so good to be in the house with Lord few got your Bibles let's turn back now to revelation 6 verse 7 and read the fourth seal again we were talking in the Bible study last night it's really it's really good that their brother Dale is where he's at because on this fourth seal as we've always said that somebody has to come to adoption somebody has come to a completion somebody has come to the stature of a perfect man I I was hoping somebody would say something this morning or later on that you know that doesn't say the stature of a man once brother Dale preaching don't be you therefore perfect so that's the stature of a perfect man the only way you gonna be perfect is to have these virtues so it's just really simple that we must have these they're required and if there's a requirement then there has to be a way to get there and someone will because God saw it God knew it he saw somebody had already had already come to it before the foundation of the world he's just waiting on us to come to that place so let's bow our heads just for a few minutes and truly remember Cletus Cletus sounded a little worried about brother John so let's just really remember him he's like said he's about 95 and she said it was really bad she needed Tony to get home so maybe Lord had already spoke to him or something because he was already gone before I got out there so let's bow our heads there Hanley Father we pray Lord it should be with us today be the active participant in this service Lord be the speaker be the hero be the revealer most of all Lord just open your arms and just love us you sent your word Lord to love us and Lord now we're going to speak to you out of that love letter back to you father because you love to hear you word the Prophet said so we're going to speak your word today Lord and I pray that it be you that does the speaking lord I pray that you'd be with John Smallwood Lord whatever the situation is that Lord is not too big for you and Lord that you've already intervened Lord that you'll help our brethren Lord in a time of trouble father we all going to come to a place maybe if the time keeps going on that we're going to need you in that time of trouble and I pray Lord that there'll be a group of people that will pray just as we're praying now that we that will change the situation Lord that'll take something that's awful and turn it into something Lord to be a a witness or to be something Lord that we can testify about it father we pray that should be with the ones that are sick that are not here that you touch them father bless them distressed or small whether they're with a fever and all those things and the ones that are not here the ones that are traveling brother Joe sister Rachel and them to be with him as they travel back today father fellowship and down brother Yancy's Lauren president should be with each one take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit and the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things amen and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast and who's the fourth beast eagle come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now when it won't need a chart till probably next Sunday but we were talking now and if you'll notice kind of when we get into every when when when all but all of our minds get to thinking about the same thing God comes in and ever it seems like everything we think about is on that subject have you ever noticed that because remember brother Brown said we've got to get into what the tune with the conductor then people that are playing in flutes and harps and all those things they have all different strings they have all different things they have to do but once they get into the groove and that conductor begins to conduct they just fall right in and it becomes a wonderful symphony even though they're all different instruments but it makes one great concert and that's exactly what I think we're coming to you now we're coming to the last concert we're coming to the last play the last thing that's going to happen and I'll read it to you in just a few minutes we're brother Branham was talking about the last thing that strikes this earth before we go home and spiritual death all right that's kind of what we're going to be speaking on again spiritual death part to natural death is not bad spiritual death is really bad they meant so we're going to read Joel again and kind of background just for a minute and then bring something to you probably not this coming Sunday obviously but the next Sunday we'll speak a little bit on the resurrection make kind of hit a few things this afternoon but to me that's that's the next thing before we we can't leave here without a resurrection so there's got to be a calling of the dead out of the ground like we were talking about this morning now and those people are not going to come in here and they're not gonna have to wipe the dust off of their body they're not gonna have to dig their way out of a grave no no they're going to come from that other dimension they're gonna walk into this dimension they're gonna pick up that body in that grave pop right back just like Jesus went through the wall pop right back up and then enter in with us and have no problem with that no fear no anything and nothing like that so we're not going to be a we're not going to have to to a graveside and we're not going to drive by and see red mountain of dirt up on know this is a secret catching away this is this is the world Jesus said the world will see me no more but you'll see me so what happens is is when we enter in and begin we get born again and we enter into what God's mind is thinking then we see these things more clear than maybe somebody else because if you were to ask maybe someone in a denominational Church if say what do you think about the resurrection well you gonna get about 50 different ideas what's going to happen but brother Branham told us what's going to happen even God took him into the sixth dimension to show him that the people were alive more live there than they are here and that he had to come back here and that they're going to come back here because the Bible always said that but really we didn't understand that until the Prophet came it's like I was saying this morning I I really like to use I'm a preach on Nellie's or again in the future but remember Eliezer did not write the love letter he told Rebecca about Isaac so much till when Rebecca got off the camel that was probably fifty people or a hundred people in the field working but Eleazar had told her so much about Isaac that when she lid off that camel the Bible says she ran and she didn't have to go are you are you are know she ran right to the guy but now remember Eliezer didn't run with her he was finished with his work just like Mordechai was finished with his work there's there's always a person there that has a word brother Branham had a work to do but he's not here he's our Eliezer that told us about our Isaac so he didn't write the love letter God wrote the love letter before the foundation of the world the prophet of God didn't change the love letter the prophet of God just told us what the love letter said he told us the in between and and you know he at least I probably said now this Isaac he probably described him right to a tea because you know what because Ellie is our new Isaac you just just didn't pull somebody off that says what well I don't know if we know Isaac or not I really wouldn't know him if I met him no Eliezer was right there with him the whole time he was commissioned actually by Abraham it was in Abraham house remember he come in and Eliezer so in other words he grew up and he was studied he was mature like we were talking about last night God doesn't start a church as a baby he starts some estimate or people all right because you know what I need to mature somebody to help me you need to mature somebody to help you and then what Jesus say is that if you know if we're both blind with what found a niche but if I got somebody that's got some light and I follow them then I know the path when he takes me down that path I go down that path with him that's why we need a God with skin on it when either God was skin on it to lead us and to talk to us and to speak to us and to take Donnie faught Bush this situation where william branham never met donnie for bush but samuel day old met Donnie for Bush in knows Donnie for Bush and he can help Donnie for Bush proved the message of the hour but still he didn't know him but here we are here today for each one of us I was thinking about that last night in a Bible study we all need help all of us needs help there's no great ones among us there's no big eyes and little use we all need help we all get a little crumb sometimes we get a whole pie but sometimes we get just a crumb but you know a crumb from the pie of God is good enough for me remember what the syrophoenician woman said she said just give me the crumb you can call me a dog you can call me what everyone called me I just want a crumb off from under your table hey man and that's being you so we're gonna get a crumb today maybe or maybe you'll get a pile will say be glad you children of Zion of resourcing the Lord your God for you have given you the form of rain currently and he will call us to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar DePalma worm my great army which I sent among you and ye shall eat him plenty so in other words when he restores what happened was that plant was a great plant and then Satan through false doctrine eat that thing down to a stump well you can't eat up you can't eat a stump you can't eat a root well yeah but you can but when when you can but you take a you take a corn plant and you take a bug and you eat it down to where there's nothing but this don't you gonna eat that no God said I'm going to restore bite the whole plant because you shall eat in plenty in other words he's gonna have brother John a whole field a whole field of corn for us to eat all right hey man where's running I told you I told you my see you give all them people sugar between services and they all gonna fall asleep on me maybe you need to start bringing leeks and garlic mmm yeah cucumbers and lisas shaking his head maybe some cayenne peppers before the service I see mark over here every once in while I know what he's doing he's got that peppermint right have you ever had a shot of pure peppermint before you'll shout like Regina you get a little shot of peppermint and put it on your buddy you'll be away for a while but I told Ryan I said you fed these people sugar and I said they all gonna fall asleep so don't fall asleep on me today and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed I love that because we come to that fourth seal and to me this wraps up everything that we're going to go through that while you and I are alive as a Christian we're gonna see this right here we know that's been eat now we've come through the back part of the years of when that that bug eat all that away but I will restore a man so we're living under that I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cake worm caterpillar pummel worm so he has promised he's going to bring that plant back and we're going to eat in plenty not just nibble no we get the full meal seven course meal not just because remember down through the other ages you know what they had to take crumbs there to take pieces you and I get the whole lamb we have to eat the whole lamb because remember they had to eat the whole lamb before they left Egypt hey man there was a lamb in every house they had to eat the whole lamb before they walked out that door and made their journey to Canaan land there man so let's go to the next one now to the to the quote here where we we were talking about this this morning I mean yesterday in the Bible study I hope you understand this I don't want to be sacrilegious about this and brother Dale was using it yesterday - but if we compartmentalize or put something in a box I'm just reading you what brother Baron said he said that they were set this box up here to resent represent that if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing they can work by Martin Luther let's just take this John Wesley had a Bible because tinsdale and all them wrote the Bible while he was alive so he had a physical Bible but he didn't live the whole Bible he did not he didn't live the whole Bible so the only thing he could work by was is God said I will restore to you Luther the just shall live by faith I'll restore to you Wesley start living a better life start living a Christian life where people can see that you have what separated from that old way of doing things but see it's it's the spirit that works among them now will prove to you by the history of the church by the opening of the seals so the opening of the seals to me that compartmentalizes all that shows you what each age is there was an overlap watch exactly how the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else so you and I we can't do anything else but have the full word restored in this time in this day in this hour and in this church age because there's no other Church age so my acid well why is that important look there's no every church age there was a box sitting beside one and then it will go to the next one then it will go to the next one well folks there's not another one there's no 80 Church ages there's no other messenger to bring us another something else our box is going to get disappear and well you know what if you're in the box if Wesley's people were in the box they're in the ground waiting on you but they're going to heaven by what God told them in the Box you and I are going to take a body change because that's what the box tells us that's the spirit of the age the spirit of the time and you and I lie brother Dale said we must have these virtues because the prophet of God said you can't you can't have a resurrection and be a novice right we've had had knowledge we've had fifty years ahead knowledge like we were talking about last night the disciples you know Peter on the day that before Jesus was crucified and what did he do he got real angry and cut a man's ear off now that ain't brotherly kindness that's the same guy that preached us brotherly kindness that wasn't brotherly kindness right but when God birthed him into the family of God on the day of Pentecost Peter turns around and says I'll never do that again now I got to keep myself under control so I can teach you never heard of another situation where there was an ear cut off or or anything like that so that's what God had to do same way with you and I I was telling somebody yesterday God can we're looking for the last seed you know everybody's looking for the last seed to come in well why are we looking for him to come in why aren't we looking for him to come in they may be sitting in this building today 20 years in the message and just be sanctified and all of a sudden God birth what they have heard for twenty years and make them a mature adult so what I believe in going out there and getting lost souls don't get me wrong I believe that but that last soul has got to come to a maturity in this age so it can't be somebody that you brought in off the street and in two weeks later he's a manifested son of God that can't happen you say oh yeah anything with God yes anything with God's possible but it's highly unlikely that's going to happen amen but what about somebody sitting here that aren't even anywhere in the world that last person sitting in a message church for twenty years and finally some good Holy Ghost preacher gets up and preaches the new birth the right way and it quickens everything that they heard for twenty years and made them realize they were what in a state of sanctification see I like to think of it better that way because as soon as that person gets born again he gonna be just like Peter he's gonna be boom he's gonna be right up there to where he has these virtues working because he's been there he's been in the process that's just my you know what I don't I don't have a quote for that but I just think that's the way it would be is that God the last seed this probably still is already sitting here he's already sitting some he or she's sitting in a church listening to the Word of God and one day God is gonna quicken that and then we're all gonna go home but you know what we can't wait on that we got to go we got F what progress you said all the way to that last seed or wait till brother Branham gets back well you'll be here when the tribulation happens so anyway so does everybody understand that the Spirit is going to work by what God said the word was going to be for that hour that's why I believe the church ages had to be preached before the seals were preached to line everything up and get all the characteristics of the ages Linda get the preachers lined up or the prophets that come into those church ages and then he brought the seals because the seals then we can take just like what we've been doing take the characteristics of the seal I mean of the church ages and put them right with the seals hey man so he had to bring the church ages first before he could bring the seals all right so everybody all right with that say man all right so here we go now number two on the fifth seal we've been reading these I'm just gonna do it the background let's just go over this now we know that the last beast was what an eagle all right the fourth living beast was an eagle now we just studied the ages study the scripture is an eagle and in the Bible the last age was an eagle age and God likens the Eagles to its prophets the last days the Eagle a is a revealer of the true word now we know that that broke with the prophet coming on the scene and bringing everything together thereby alright with that the Prophet Kant had to come on the scene to put everything together but now remember he's not the only Eagle man he's not the only Eagle look at number three now it was not mentioned of the other time of this rider now let's mention that he's called death under the revelation of the line now I want to read anyway not under the revelation of the line age of the first age the early age this wasn't revealed the next stage was the ox which was the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as it wasn't that's what it was nor the man-like beasts of wisdom representing the Reformers Lutheran Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the eagle lays the last sage the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterance the Prophet was the first one to partake of that revelation no doubt we would be lost without him not lost is in your soul we'd be lost as far as the word goes amen because he didn't say my soul Jesus Christ saved my soul and then brother Branham brought the word to what turn us back to Christ all right so that's what he done he turned us back to Christ but he didn't turn us back to Christ under a line or an ox or a man it was under the eagle anointing our prophetic utterance you and I was thinking about this last night or yesterday the Bible study you take just what we talked about last night well join them they were they were there they they said he had a good time why cuz it was a lot of questions answered you get a lot of questions answered in the by in Bible study all right but you take that what we were talking about last night just to three different little doctrinal issues Paul would have Paul would have understood it but it would have took a little more background for Paul to really understood what we were talking about the Apostle Paul he wrote the word but he was what he was prophesying of a group of people to come same way with Luther and Wesley brother Graham said if Wesley what if Paul would come back what he'd be in jail tomorrow right if Wesley were to come back or Luther words to come back and sit down here and listen just a little while sure they would catch it but man it would their mind at first but to me and you it's become normal in common why because we have let's just put it this way we are no better than nobody else don't you ever think that if you think you're better than somebody else you got the wrong spirit but but wait a minute what gods say about you you're a prophetic people you have prophetic utterance you have a prophetic mind that's what's your box is Paul didn't have to do that this box this is your box this is the box that we are dealing under we are prophetic people with an eagle anointing that didn't leave with the prophet no it didn't leave with the Prophet it actually enhanced everything Amen just like Jesus when he was here he didn't say nobody when he was physically here he didn't save a person but he come back 50 days later and saved in 123,000 now 30 million maybe a man he did more work when he was gone same way with the property God if the Prophet would have stayed around here they would have thought he was God and they would have done all these things and but God took him off so we could focus on Christ amen focus on Christ not doing away with brother branham without him folks we would not be oh my lord we'd be just like and I'll read it in a minute we'd be spiritually dead we'd be sitting in the church and we'd be spiritually dead but now you and I with prophetic utterance we can take all these things even excuse me Romans that were doing downstairs I've learned more in the first eight chapters of Romans and I've read it 50 hundred times what is 1500 a lot I've read it a hundred times and you just get more and you just get more and you just get more I see now that that what Paul was writing in Romans went into the Romans it was to me it was my this my book that's what Paul wrote to me but you know what it was it was good now you don't think you don't think God sir well now I'm just gonna write you know about twelve or fourteen chapters or Romans and just to fill the Bible up I'm gonna write that in there and maybe somebody will read it he wrote that specifically because he knew you'd need it when you got here he knew I would need it when I got here hey man that's why you need to make this thing personal to me the seals make this thing personal it brings a personal revelation to you not to the guy sitting beside you to you amen because remember it's a personal affair with God not 144,000 no individuals amen because look 144,000 they have a box to work in the two prophets are not to us right they're to 144,000 so they have an anointing that's coming after we leave and that's all there be able to deal with they're not gonna pull out 148,000 they're gonna get 12,000 out of 12 tribes and it's gonna be 144,000 people plus two saved and taken out of here amen so that's how precise God is with them but you and I he's not that he knows the number but you're not knowing he takes us as a nation okay so now it's looking to see what this spirit is doing this Antichrist spirit that has been made known while the seals are open is number number four now I want you to know this to four of them notice the are mark of four of the spiritual mathematics God is threes this is for he's in for here first Antichrist white cause anything that's against God is anti right so so the whole basis of Satan is as he's anti he's anti word he's anti God he's anti everything alright second false prophet red remember he comes up and they don't get goes from a saying to a deed to a doctrine all right vai Kirov hep third vai curve heaven and earth and purgatory black now fourth is the one world now fourth the Beast now what happens is Satan has incarnated a human being in this part Satan has incarnated a human being but I but before he can incarnate a human being God has the Incarnate a human being and then God in this fourth seal God has that's why this is so important this is not just a pretty picture I love the one Aaron I love the one that's got Christ standing in this because he's the only perfect man I've never lived on the earth but through him through him you and I are heirs and joint heirs when we come under the adoption like I tried to run it off few minutes ago and I couldn't get it but maybe we'll get it run off for you at home but about adoption because when he adopts you into the family can tada he can't kick you out and then so when he get when we're adopted into the family we received the spirit of adoption we are heirs and joint heirs when we gonna start believing that amen and I'll prove something to you just just right at the end of this if that's okay so now remember Satan being kicked out of heaven Satan being kicked out of heaven forth the Beast Pale Horse Satan being kicked out of heaven why is he kicked out of heaven because we're heading in that that we're going there we're going there and Satan is going to come here remember he's accusing who he's accusing Gentiles the bride he's accusing the bride right now but when we leave this earth when we come to perfection what's he going to say what's he going to say when the dead walk back in and we get a glorified body what Satan got to accuse you thought of that I want you to think of that where is the accuser of your brethren he's here now why because we're not in perfection yet we're in we're had were in the box of perfection right but when we come to a body change the prince of this world has come and has nothing in me remember when Jesus said jesus said he has nothing Satan is not even found yet he's not even near me why he was a perfect man so Satan being kicked out of heaven the reason he's been kicked out of heaven is that's what we're going he can't stand to be where we are so when we go to heaven he comes right here and does what he incarnate a beast he incarnate a human man called the Pope that has yielded itself just like you supposed to yield yourself to God he yields himself to that fault system listen thinking that he's right he's not gonna walk up and say well now I'm gonna I'm gonna kill everybody I say no he's gonna be what come in with flattery he's gonna come in with we're gonna bring the world together and you know what I got enough money I'll bail you out United States I'll just I'll just write you a check but you got to do some things for me yeah you got a speak for me you got they listen with God there's no strings attached with Satan there's all kind of strings it's like spaghetti everything's attack anything Satan does it's all attached hey you got to do this and I got to do that and I'm gonna do this and you're gonna do that God just says believe my word believe on me and you'll have eternal life no strings attached amen alright so first Antichrist second false prophet third biker of heaven and earth but fourth is the beast that's where all those powers come together and make one person this is one man that's gonna rule the world for a certain period of time and then for three and a half years remember he's going to make a covenant according to Daniel 70 weeks he makes a covenant for one for seven years or one week and in the midst of that week he's going to break that covenant you know what he's going to do he's going to walk in and tell Israel I am your God then all heck's gonna break loose cuz there's what's gonna say no I don't think you are you get out of my temple he says no this is my temple and then somebody's gonna match the button cuz remember brother Brown said the Vatican the what the atomic bomb was gonna go right down into the Vatican and blow it to smithereens who's gonna mash that button a Catholic I don't think so but anyway that's for them after we're gone that's just that's just little peripheral things that that we enjoy talking about but we're not gonna be here to see that but remember let's remember these three things because I want to make a point here I'll be very long we got communion today remember go the next one in this sealed death has to be destroyed a resurrection has to take place and a rapture takes place on this seal the next seal you see remember is in another dimension so as we go into another dimension Satan comes into this dimension sure he's already here but he's going to literally incarnate a man I don't think we understand that sure he's working in everything but he's gonna literally incarnate one man and that one man you know what he's gonna have signs he's gonna have wonders he's gonna Rock miracles the Bible says and the whole world is gonna fall at his feet what thinking he's the Savior in the world that's what they'll think they'll think well we finally got the man yeah they did they finally got the man but you and I though under the opening of these seals we know where he's at and what he's doing all the things that's happened and we know where that's coming from and we live look because we're gonna read some things like we did last week we're not talking about the people we're talking about the system the system they're under is dead and then the system they're under is dead not the people but you have to remember if you willingly attach yourself to the system you become part of that system okay and you die with it all right but you do have maybe maybe you do have hope at the wine-throwing I don't know but let's look just right here number five it's just a little more background then we'll then we'll get to her to our point now fully look now watch this is on the fourth seal notice fully Satan on his throne offered it to God offered it to our Lord here he is sitting here with this beastly heart in him now here is the person the beast the Incarnate devil he makes his appearing here on earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false pretense of the true word he associates himself with the word so he's not this gruesome horrible thing no he associates himself with the Word of God that's what he wants to be that's what he wants to be he wants to be associated but watch what but now look we have a promise let's read the national number six this is from the fourth seal now we had him coming last night with a great sword to kill we find out that he gets killed with the sword to the sword of the word so see we're no match for the devil but God's give us a word in this end time to defeat the devil with and then the sword of the word God's words sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down wait till them seven thunders under their voices in that group who really can take the word and hand it there poured that group in it where's that group my brothers and sisters I want to ask you that question there is a group and you gotta be alive you gotta be listening to the full Word of God you make your choice and hand it there it'll slice and cut and they can close the heavens they can shut this to that whatever they want to do you say well I thought about the two prophets folks I think we're gonna have a little bit of control on this side we're gonna have to to keep to destroy death we're gonna have to come to a place to where Adam had full control of nature you and I are gonna have full control of nature I just believe that he will be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth it's sharper than a two-edged sword they call for a hundred billion tons of Flyers daddy doesn't like this one if they hunted well they all said anything but flies please anything but flies okay whatever they say is gonna happen maybe it'll wake you up a little bit whatever you say is gonna happen because it's the Word of God coming from the mouth of God now that's coming from you though because watch watch his soul you say well that's all coming from God that's all coming from God what's his summation just like Paul Paul takes 20 verses but he'll take one verse in he'll surmise or he'll make a summation in one verse he'll make a summation in one verse of everything he's talking about what just right here you saw what's coming from the mouth of God that's coming from here it's coming from there it's his word but he always uses man to work it God could call for them flies in Egypt but he said Moses that's your job I'll just tell you what to do and you go do it he fully done that see he could have chose the son to call him he could have caused the moon to call him or the wind to call it but he said Moses that that he chooses men so true like we were told by this mother dealt in fivefold ministry I know we keep harping on that but man I tell you the Bible is clear for the perfecting of the Saints we got to listen to a fivefold ministry all right and you know what I was thinking about this the other day that guy's taking cannabis oil or something I never I never heard that going off of you he's but the Word of God has to come through me and you it's just that way just like he said right there he chose Moses he chose David he chose but now he's chose a bride to speak through this is not a one man message anymore it was brother Branham brought the message when he brought the message he was just like I said he's like a pipe god just poured it down that pipe and it came right out of his mouth and I really don't care if his dates are wrong I don't care for his mama was a hundred and fifty when he had her had him I really don't care don't bring me that stuff amen I can read what that love letter says I'm sure Ellie Azar's thing about this last night I'm sure Eliezer had his problems he wasn't perfect but he had a commission and when that commission was fulfilled guess what you'll hear rallies are no more he got Isaac and Rebekah together he'd done his job and then he left the scene amen Moses got him up to the promised land left to sing Joshua took him over amen as it was a promise son not Eleazar Isaac was the promised son and Rebekah was the promised woman because look wall came through that amen so you and I have been chosen not by man you and I have been chosen by God Himself listen we're alive we're still here we're still listening we're still speaking we're still what getting thing getting revelation so it's for me and you that's just a way out it's just for me and you mayor didn't sit there and go through a checklist that day that the she asks one question how can a woman that's not met a man have a baby and what the Angels say ain't nothing too hard for God he didn't explain how it was gonna happen he said ain't nothin too hard for God and she said okay be it unto me according to thy word but she had to receive it that's what we're gonna talk about now what we're leading up to is there is a physical death and there's a spiritual death okay if you don't believe that I'm glory we're brother Branham said it now they don't have they've gotten this one but I'm gonna read I pulled the brother Dale I pulled up a 7 a and a B and I didn't have time to cut it with a scissors like so I'm gonna read this one and then we're going to read that one listen to listening the token let me tell you today as a servant unless the token is on the door there's a spiritual death going to strike and all churches are headed back for the Council of world council of churches they're all going back to Catholicism and only those who are genuine born-again is going to stay out he said let me tell you as a servant this is what's going to happen remember not your Pentecostal denomination because you've already you're already in it shows they are dead they are perished they sacrificed they went back they put him outside the door but he is looking for the token because the only thing they relied upon was speaking in tongues don't you allow them speaking in tongues no nothing else but let the token itself be there the person of Jesus Christ his own life and UCO's remember when you come to Egypt that's right when you come to Egypt though that was all substitute that blood of that lamb didn't come back into those believers because you know what as soon as they left and went out into the wilderness they're going why do we do this Moses you brought us out here and we're sick and we why not we're safe but we're huh green with week ain't got nothing to drink no that was under a natural lamb that was a substitute but when that lamb comes inside of me and you you say all we have our bad days sure we have our bad days and our good days but Christ lives in you and he'll take you on through that journey it wasn't a sub this ain't a substitute we're living under we're living under the real and then we're not living under no there is no substitute in this word it's the real thing or it's nothing amazing of God in 1964 they spiritually died now this is a spiritual veil that was a natural veil now what is he talking about the Holy of Holies that was a natural veil this is a spiritual veil they kept walking right on in behind there you can tell them oh I know I know that scene go ahead that's all right it only speaks you remember the last plague in Egypt was death before the Exodus the last plague on this earth is spiritual death before the Exodus then they'll be cremated and turned back to the dust it's pretty hard by the Brenham they'll be cremated and turned back to the dust and the righteous will walk out on their ashes but the last thing is spiritual death rejecting the word and then so we're going to look at two deaths just for a few minutes and I'll pull that one back up here on the spoken words original seed because remember Eve's death did not begin in her physical womb Mary's life that she accepted did not come in their womb first natural one worse you have to accept it first appear same way with any of us in it the brother branham explains it and I'm not going to explain it here but why I'm sorry you read I put it in there so let's let him let's let him answer that so what is that camera that don't over dealing with you don't know okay let's just see in the back of my head I'm gonna stand over here like this I'm not one I want to break the where they can see this online this was both physical and spiritual with Eve first and anytime so anytime this is what's going to happen I told you ask you this morning sister to forgive me so I can mention that any time that a woman takes the wrong step I'm talking about Christ in the bride now but he is going to the natural but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to first receive it in her mind right the angel didn't come to Mary and say Mary I've already placed something in your womb no he had to talk to her he had to get her to confess be it unto me according I were he didn't he didn't plant the seed and tell her about it that's not what it is but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to first receive it in her mind right some slicker has to persuade her and she listens to it against her own better judgment than the act is committed so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind he said what's this got to do to the fourth seal for seal his death it's named death we must look at natural listen spiritual death is causing natural death natural death is not causing spiritual death spiritual death is causing natural death because she died spiritually first in the womb of her mind now not her soul that's what we're talking bout this morning not in the if so her soul was eternal she had that theophany of Genesis 1:26 man so this is what that middle memory reason conscious affects an imagination Eve Satan hit Eve's mind he said all you can't do wrong if you're born again you must live somewhere I don't hello you must live somewhere I don't live so that's where my problem is that middle man memory reason conscious affection imagination that has not been turned back but by what by the Word of God it will be it is being born again brother John it is being born again he asked the question last night well John asked a question this or this and me and daddy both answered at the same time yes I mean it was two cars it was it should have been a yes and a no but it was both of them yes well that's what it is because you're being born again these things are being birthed in you the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the mind receive the word then the Spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are amen to me that's so simple but you had to hear the word first because remember what brother Branham said about Mary that Mary and her momma or even Mary and Joseph had talked about Isaiah where a virgin shall conceive so she had received that's like the woman at the well they don't go back and look at that scripture of the woman at the well the woman at the well says we know that when Messiah comes in other words she wasn't reading playboy magazine she was doing that but she wasn't reading she had read the Bible she had just got a wrong spirit owner but she had read the Bible or the Old Testament scroll she had read the Old Testament Scrolls and said we know when Messiah comes jesus said that how quicker quicker nothing else but that I'll quicken that when Messiah comes he'll do these things and he said I am he she didn't have to go back and reread the scroll again she had already read it that's why you brothers and sisters with wives and husbands and children this out that are not born again somewhere I don't care where it is my kids have heard the word and somewhere God's gonna click on that one they'll stop when they'll stop somewhere and let God speak to her then that word that they held I just believe that there you are that's what does it that's the real gospel teaching brother and I believe he kind of got a little excited that's the real gospel teacher brethren I believe if Saint Paul was standing today he'd teach the same thing I do in this hour what was the results with her now somebody's physical and spiritual death all right what is the results of those who accept the other way it goes into this frolic today that they got both physical and spiritual death both body and spirit shall be annihilated be no more that's exactly right you know to me that would be the most horrible thing because we're all human beings we all have a persona or we're all persons but one day all these people that don't accept Jesus Christ as their Savior just you ever thought about that it's like they never were here they never were in the mind of God except in the part of knowing that life was going to happen but in the eternal section the only way you can be known eternal is to be in the eternal section much betting on you okay but that's it though you just go away you're never to be remembered again you listen you're walking dead you have no substance you have nothing if you're not born again nothing both body and spirit shall be annihilated be no more that's exactly right because you know what Satan's gonna hass gonna happen to him too amens that all right Saints gonna have them Satan too now let me read this one right here I don't know which we want to read first let's go this one the one I've got you don't have all right this is from that time 1962 if you want to pull it up it put in now even to this day and you and you'll get it should be 1962 seven thirteen from that time okay in Washington cuz I want you to read this one I want you to listen to me look I don't look over there if the last death is spiritual death before the Exodus then in contrast to that there's got to be full life no that's what you're living now there's got other words the full words got to be restored the full life has got an eternal life has got to be walking on the earth for spiritual death to hit the camp amen now even to this day that same Holy Spirit that has lifted us up from a life of sin where we once lived and we've already dead in Christ listen I told him last night before it work now we're going to talk about though we're heading into resurrection next service would be resurrection to have a resurrection there's going to be a death you can't resurrect something's life gotta be dead that's why we got to talk about physical and spiritual death because there's a physical death in the spiritual that I'm in now even to this day that same Holy Spirit that has lifted us up from a life of sin where we once lived we've already dead in Christ buried and raised with him in his resurrection I want to make a point that just in a few minutes and setting now in heavenly places with him amen watching him work among us why why I ain't out yonder he can say some things about why ain't I out yonder amongst of the denomination's because it's those that are dead and buried in him and raised with him in his resurrection and now not we will be we are now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we've read this a million times we all have but listen looking back to where we once came from where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going I told him this morning that takes the fear factor out of all that brother Ron thank you for that I read that this morning and Sunday school he wrote me a good little note about fear fear is false evidence appearing real but you know why you're afraid of something because you don't know what the outcome is as human beings we try the best we can and sometimes it flops but now in God that don't happen any mess we make is ours it's not God's a man but the fear we have is that it will do something wrong or the fear that we have is we'll do something and don't know what the outcome is God's never had fear he knows what the outcome is as soon as he thinks that he sees it and it's already happened how can you fit so you know what you and I are prophetic people now what does the prophetic people do brother Branham looked back and said I saw you sitting on a young sleep to this if you want to but I think it's pretty profound brother Branham looked back and saw you sitting saw somebody sitting on the the ramp said I see you sitting in the doctor's office and the darks are telling you what what was he looking forward no he's looking back he was in a prophetic realm looking back at what something that happened two days before a month before six months before right the person was standing there he said I feel you're Christian so that's right then he said now I see you like Bill Dow laying in a hospital bed dead almost brother Gramps that I see you shaking my hand in the Tabernacle when in the future that's prophetic utterance that is what you and I have got to have you and I have got to see where we came from know what we're doing here but we know where we're going forget about the situation it's already done because that's where the fear comes in the fear comes in when we say well I don't know where I'm going no you can't do that watch and now not we will be we are now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus looking back to we were once came from a direct evidence that we receive part of it because we are dead and our life is hidden gone through Christ and already raised again in the resurrection with him amen oh my like the old color sister said she said I'm not going to ought to be I'm not going to want to be but I'm sure not what I used to be all right so let's go now to the one that we have here number eight brothers the way of a true prophet 1962 and then he gave us all things now we have the earnest of our inheritance now listen close and I ain't preaching on that subject but it just feels good for me right now see that we have the earnest for that for one day we walked in sin and after being baptized in his name and raised with him in resurrection we've been brought out of sin never no more to want to go back again we are raised from sin with the evidence that we have keep rolling we're potentially in the resurrection from all death see if we could raise up from sin by faith in him and there is sin we would want to go back would who would want to go back to the garbage can of sin again we've passed from death to life and that's the earnest that's the earnest of the complete resurrection all death physically physically he talked about spiritual death he's on my physical death and spiritual we've done overcome spiritual death because we passed from death unto life now I love this right here as Elijah went down to Jordan now remember in Elijah type move crossing Elijah taught the bride amen all right as Elijah went down to Jordan one day and struck it with Elijah Elijah and it parted back he crossed over he came back with a double portion and when we strike Jordan with Christ we got one portion but when we return we're coming with two portions we got eternal life resurrection from sin now in righteousness with the Holy Ghost and then on the return with Christ we come back with both physical resurrection and we've already got spiritual rigors of resurrection we have a double portion of it Amen so if you're already resurrected spiritually sitting in heavenly places those who he's justified he's already glorified that's why we take a that's why we take a rapture on the fourth seal cuz everything's all culminated the justification has went to what glorification because we get a glorified body while we're on earth no one speak just for a second don't pull up number nine yet but we were talking yesterday about adoption now what happens in adoption is is that when you adopt someone all of their records are wiped away from their past we talked about this a little bit last night because when you come to adoption you get a new name and I'm gonna read that next Sunday but I'm just gonna give you a little seed for about five minutes and it will close mm-hmm you and I were born ain't come about mom and dad we were born in sin we were born in a family a family of death between Satan and Eve of the prophet of God said Amen but when God took us and the right of adoption is is you take somebody from one family and place them into another family that sound good it sounds good to me because I don't want be in that family no more but when he adopts me into the family my old records struck listen number 9 invisible Union what's this well you separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again are remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you and then now you're old book is gone with your old Union now your name and you're old and has been transferred you get a new birth certificate because that's what it means to be born again it means your first birth was wrong and you needed to be born again how simple is that do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you can't take an adopted person and check their record back but to the adoption time all other records are struck amen God put in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the Lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate hallelujah were your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold why before the foundation of the world you were in the mind of God he wrote the words so that you could get the word respond to the word and that's the only seed there is it's not a little wiggle tail running around in your body somewhere this eternal I I just don't believe that now you're not only forgiven but you're justified don't want to ask you a question just this is this is like brother Darrell does sometimes let me ask you a question and we ain't gonna preach on it for two weeks I've always thought I've always had a question that the Bible says that we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep I'm reading Thessalonians 4 the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together now I kind of had a problem with that go see I'm looking at this how can we preach a resurrection message and we weren't changed first you never thought about that how can that how can that life come out of me and I'm still living in this dead thing this is dead if you don't know that or not I'm not y'all know y'all not viewing me today but this is the preview if the time goes on we all go on view each other you understand what I mean physical I know I've already spiritually died I've already spiritually went in heavenly places in other words my old Union everything we just talked about but how how can me I'm not changed I know it's a revelation but somewhere in the Bible it's got to tell me this let's read it pull it up John 11 this answered a question for me and I hope it answered the question for you then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day she throwed it way 2,000 years down the road right what Jesus said now this is a man this is what I like this is a physical mortal man its flesh it's not eternal he's dying his self hello he's dying his self you are 30 years old let me know it says you're 50 you seen Abraham you're not even 50 years old he was 30 he was physically dying in that body standing in that great front of that grave and he says I am I am the resurrection he denied the body he was standing in he denied the body that he was standing in you and I have to deny the body that we're standing in see that's been my problem I'm like man what a great act brother Gary what a great act that was sitting up here preaching and Robert Tatum walks through the door through the door they'll have to open it walks through the door and he's standing in the glorified body and we're standing here still dying but it has nothing to do with that Jesus was standing on earth when he said that right there and he was heading toward death itself in the physical in the physical flesh so to me that answers the question what's all this greatness it's inside it's inside he didn't nod cuz look here's the key Martha is throwing it 2,000 years down the road you know what she's doing she's lying about what she said a minute ago whatever you say Lord roll it back down Ignis us but Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee jesus said thy brother shall rise again now watch her carnality Martha said unto him I've no know that he shall rush she was denying that he was the resurrection she was you know why because here Jesus walked up probably like this he'd been four days journey you know he's all stooped over and because remember we'll get to this next hour two Sundays from now remember the prayer he prays he said father it's not for me it's for these people standing around me because they're looking at this dead body that I'm living in but they don't see that I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die my question do you believe it though this the stand our feet believe us now this let's stand our feet believest thou this so that answered my question how can we the alive and remain be anything special it ain't got nothin to do with the flesh it's all what's inside even though even God himself was standing in a dead body when he said I am the resurrection and the what a revelation let's bow our head help me Father thank you for this day Lord and the further men of the service comes if we take communion Lord we pray that what we've said Lord has been good communion to you today Lord that everybody is is growing and we're coming together as one and we see the little bride and we see that the rough edges are being knocked off and Lord I believe you're polishing up this image that we're supposed to come into this stature of a perfect man not a statue because the fact you doesn't move you want a statue or a growth development Lord you want a moving breathing instrumentality of yourself here on the face of the earth so that one day we can stand and say I am the resurrection and the life believeth now this and the Dead is gonna walk in among us regardless of how old we get or what all any circumstance looks in this flesh Paul said in Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Lord forgive us of our sins that we commit against you Lord all the all the bad thoughts and bad things we do Lord just being human and not treating people right and all the different things Lord that we all we all have those things that we do litter that are wrong Lord I pray that you'd forgive us Lord sanctifies for their journey thank to Fox now especially as we take this communion Lord that it will actually plus all Lord to come together and stay clean and be ready for this journey because I believe truly that were standing on the face of this earth somebody's gonna say them and it's not just a little Lazarus gonna come forth it's gonna be all the saints from Paul all the way down to here we're gonna walk in among us and we're gonna get out of here father we thank you for all things bless us Lord take care of us be with us Lord and the further ment of this service and Jesus name we pray Lord be with us in the weeks coming up Lord that you'll take care of us bless us in Jesus name Amen you love the Lord but think of that forget about the body they're now all that stuff yeah we can do all this stuff to it but Jesus was standing there and he didn't have a problem he didn't have to go brother Brown said he didn't pray up he didn't have to pray now what I believe that he didn't have to pray but he said father because of these people in other words standing around him and then here they go to this great revelation that Jesus was so human that the Bible said he wept where did he weep at the tomb of Lazarus I believe he was weeping because of their unbelief because hey listen I wouldn't weep if I knew that if if Gary brother Gary Krantz passed away and then three days later I had a vision and he was gonna walk back among us I wouldn't be crying for there I'd be rejoicing he was crying because of their unbelief they did not believe he was the resurrection even Martha was putting it 2,000 years that's what our problem is we keep going guys coming know if you're dead in Christ you're already resurrected I mean god bless you come on just give our brother a good name jesus said I am the resurrection and the life so water week we are him made manifest in another form right amen make sure you tell her brother how much you appreciate it because we believe the word right let's go to first Corinthians 11 verse 23 I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me where as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you just use the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now I love this critter but when we are judged we're chasing one because we're his children right of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world where for my brother and when you come together to eat hurry one for another and if any man hungry let him eat at home that you come out together unto condemnation the rest I said in order when I come let's just have a few moments of silent prayer praying one for the other the Lord would bless each and everyone probably thank you for your word that you've given unto us and for the light of the hour that we're able to walk in to be able to see these things just Lord forgive us when we fail you and we don't walk according to your ways and thoughts and just help each and every one of us and guide us Lord thank you for all things we pray now that you'd bless each and every one each one person here that we all may be together as one in you and walk in the light of your love we love you and we thank you and we commit it
