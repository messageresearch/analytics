that in other words he don't ever change a man that's one thing we can rely upon is he don't ever change Amen I'm so thankful for them he's an unchanging God he can't change his desire for us he ain't change his attitude toward us he changed his purpose for us he throws us away he just keeps working on us daily I'm glad of that many times he could have throwed the clay way but he just kept putting it on the way own kept working on it - he brains it - what he's got predestined in his mind to be and I'm so thankful for that hey man we sure appreciate y'all y'all saw such a special crowd special people their blood kin you know I'm glad of that blood 10 a man was born through the blood of God said now flows through my veins royal blood amen brother Brennan I'm no longer the son of Charles and hella Brown I'm a son of the Living God Amen well that excites me amen amen that's something that we ought to realize stand with me for the reading of his word just a little thought the Lord they don't know heart so many things we could say things with your preach but you know we want to do what he wants us to do it keeps us out of trouble when we do that you know that way if you have any problem with little brother Louise we say you know talk to the master about it we get in that fellowship with him and leadership him you got any probably had a problem with him I mean I'm so bad we don't have a problem with him I feel like piling I'm not pilot but I feel like pilot I find no fault in this man named Jesus amen please Nasty's chapter 4 I want to read a little verse and then we'll run go from there please yesterday's chapter 4 verse 12 they said even if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and the three-fold cord is not easily broken father Lord Jesus father were so thankful for that Lord God above us got in us God with us oh god I'm so thankful for you Lord Lord we're so grateful this evening Lord to have another opportunity Lord we know our opportunities are getting every time we assemble there's less and less times we'll be able to assemble God but old Father we want to make the most of this service this afternoon Doha in the only way we can make the most evidence that we can we can not only invite you to this service O God but we'll make you welcome here tonight Lord O God may you be so welcome dawn may you be so welcome that should walk the aisles Lord that you speak to every heart in every soul here Lord but father they're your children they know exactly what you have need of Lord what you they need Lord and were you know exactly what they want what they desire Oh God father I pray you to grant the desires of your children's heart the night Lord and father you just use me in a special way Lord the way only you can use me Lord follow however you want to use me then use me for your glory Lord we ask you to do these things God just strengthen us Lord and they help us to get out of your way Lord now speak to your children Lord live to hear Lord heart-to-heart spirit the spirit soldier so long we asked you to do these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen you may be seated I want to talk about being connected a spirit I won't talk about the spiritual connection but I want to talk about being connected or disconnected in fellowship with God and we see here that here is here is one of the the had a greater gift one of the greatest gifts of wisdom of any man and he he began to speak this he begin to tell you know there's one prevail against him two shall withstand him and the three-fold cord is not easily broken I want to talk about that kind of type it would like the spirit the wiring of a light and we see that the light has a positive it has a negative and it has a why and no matter no matter no matter you have a certain you have a certain design that you have to connect them together to get the full effects of the light and you know that God has a design for me and you because brother Brennan said you can you can have the Holy Spirit on your flesh in your spirit and dine go to Hale but he said if you get it on your soul inside that soul you can live a man that's the pause about the reason I got that law thought it's been several years ago many times I had been having trouble at my with my with my he'd read at home and it did get to the place where it was so hard to you know we just kept burning that burn and they couldn't figure out what it was you know I didn't had a man he'd come in and put me a furnace in and he'd run four or five months and burn up burned the board up so I finally got a guy who you know I've got a guy come on he said you got you got major problems they said you got negative flirty I believe that's what's wrong with a lot of people around the lot of people around the message you've got big problems you've got negative flirty you've got your Navy you've got your negative and your positive crossed you're trying to receive the power of God to live the life of God but you're not hooked up right amen I believe that and I believe God is able to put this together and if we we could wire this light up even you can cross the wires and their work but they'll burn up that's what's happening around the message love people are burning up they're burning out the others say it that way they're burning me out because they've not been connected right they've not been connected right to Jesus Christ and let's look up into the book of Genesis turn with me to Genesis chapter 3 and let's look at how Satan had a design but God already had a plan Satan had wanted to design broad-breasted he did he said he offered to design the woman but God and God knew that he was going to do it but he God had a plan God was not caught off guard he didn't just walk into this and say oh man I wonder wait a minute let me like we do sometimes what am I gonna do he's off already no that's why in the Bible said he's slaying the lamb of God before the foundation of the world he already had a connection that he was going he was going straight is back up in our wiring because he knew Satan will try to come in and mix those bloodlines and when he mixed those bloodlines he created the positive and negative together instead of being separate where they could free flow through and receive the right power would they didn't get sick they didn't have hard hates they didn't have troubles they wasn't no sin there was none of that that was fugly speak the word and it happened they said I got to mix this bloodline Jesus said I got a royal bloodline coming I've already paid for it I got redemptive power I've been wanting to illustrate those I've got one to heal I can't do it this is gonna happen but it's not it's gonna be for my glory it might Rory alone and as we look at this scripture here it says in in Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 it says now the serpent was more subtil he was hey he was smarter than a lot of people are it's smart and a lot of people he had a septum means he had knowledge of all things he was smart enough to know that if he Satan is that he was the smartest one he could use he couldn't use a monkey he couldn't use a gorilla he couldn't use any of those things he's gonna use the beast cuz he was that he was the only wasting he was to want they could mix the blood line with they could inject his perversion in there but God said I got that covered I'm already ahead of you see he says more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said he didn't just come out and tell her hey wait a minute now God don't know what he's talking about let me take something that wouldn't work that what they don't work on me and you if you tell me God don't know what he's telling me I already then turns you off this is a ok and the brother bran didn't know what he's talking about I just get y'all you know the man of God don't know he's talking about the real man ago I cut you off and that's what problem is we got some mini parking lot of preachers around the message you know the man who got this up here you know the Word of God is that the word is still good safe it's still good to say but the Bible said he got choked out what we get choked out is because we let the cares of life choke the word out that brought breaks the connection the fellowship that's what Eve did she let that see that that the care of her life more than taking it over the faith that God had her hid she took wisdom she said I'll take this I'll take this I'll take this as a substitute he said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said and then she began to preach back to him and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the tree of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the surface said unto the woman ye shall not surely die just takes one oh let's just take the cross you get two wires getting the burn the thing up it all it takes just one cross and wire when you doubt one word of God the end your wires crossed no matter what you say no matter how your trial didn't what you do if you've got a problem with the whole truth of God something's wrong with your wine you've got a connection somewhere it's messed up you're not gonna be able to live to the fullness that you're supposed to until God comes down and connects you the way you should be I said and for God does know listen at him now he says for God does nothing in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open their eyes is already open he was offering for something he was I never seen the serpent command name the animals I never tell never heard the servant tell north wind stopped blowing south wind blow listen what he tells me he says and you shall be as gods he wasn't no God mmm he was trying to take it her to believe that she could take something but it was a lower level they already was in that position they they obeyed had the serpent he never named one animal he was saying look he's gonna be like me go mr. Perry who's gonna know good and see what the problem was it wasn't that that the tree was bad it was was it was give you the knowledge of good and evil how to commit evil not only is it good just like the cell phone let's look at that I believe there's sometimes that's been a trick to us it's been a trick to us that's not I come off the tree of knowledge it can be used for good always been used for great good but you got to watch that cause it's good and evil that's what was wrong with the treated treat was good and evil mmm people misunderstand that then within the answer kids have a cell phone and they don't wash them down and see the Holy Ghost and they wonder why their kids are in the shape they're in or wondering why their wife's into shaping and then wonder why this because hey right now even when you look I don't care what if you look at something good there'll always be something pop up a little thing on there say says just stop for a minute here that's the way you always tries to do us so we've got to be careful let's put it all of our attention on him instead of on that knowledge knowledge shall increase its increasing but as people get closer to God then what's our problem it but what's gonna happen to ask for attention is if we don't wash it from what we've received in this hour we're gonna be in trouble cause little known little required but much snow months require we require a great deal more than they are you're required more than a Methodist you're required more of using the Baptist's you know that's the best thing they can do for you the Baptist of the Memphis they can bring own thing they can do you is bring you to the white throne judgment that's the best place they can bring but this message this truth can bring us to a body change bring us to a rapture branch the perfection in Jesus Christ and this is the only place that you can get it is in this message for the proper set in this message it's rapturing faith then why do you want to connect to anything besides that oh I have something for the grace of God ain't you should you be God's knowing good and evil why do they need to know evil when they was livin good there was no sin not to tempt them there's never seen until you yield yourself to the lusts there you can't say well God tempted me he didn't for God's not tainted by sin neither can he be tempted even when the devil come to tempt him he was come to try he was no champion he didn't have any champion where he was the word you can't tempt God neither's he tempted but he was sure look is good and evil listen what she did he says that when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave her her husband with her and he did eat listen what happens if it was so good then why did it open there's why did it open a veil of lust then he was such a great thing God would have given some rose to back but he said and their eye and the eyes are both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked they never knew that before they never lost it to one another than until the end then their eyes open they seemed wow we're naked you've always been naked I mean you're not writing the right apparel it's not only just naked naked this is brother Aaron was telling about this the wrong apparel naked you're not wearing what God is supplied for you so guess what they got a substitute in this what they learned how to sew they never said it before but there so Dan said they sewed fig leaves together and then if it was just by the income of an apple why didn't they sew something on their mouth why did they sew and everywhere else simple things so I can't believe that said what can't see the word said it is because they don't have understanding they don't have the tree hmm said they was naked and then they started hiding from God the fellowship was broken when they disbelieved the Word of God when the idea was already committed in their mind before she ever did act the first thing was she listened they told me this morning we listen and then he began to reason his revelation - because there won't be nothing no kind of God like you false God seyton get a recognition of being a god he said he's the god of this evil age he's not the true and living God he gets the bane you know what he got to the place to work he stays a conference what he said he would do because he's even feeling what he had in his mind to do then why are we not fulfilling what we're supposed to do then if he's received the power to do that by Louise then how come we've not received apart we have we've just not got enough faith to operate it we're not exercising mmm we're not exercising that faith he gave us a measure each and every one who us a measure of faith to fulfill the Word of God he gave you can't even you can't even rejoice in your own faith because he gave it to you it's his faith to believe in his word so the equation just puts you out and wires you right back to him and we got to be connected to Jesus Christ this message didn't come - turns away this message kind of turns back this message it kind of made me walk away to get this groan after several years real chance to say oh well I'm giving it up I guess then what I thought they'd go problem is what you thought that's the same thing with happening with the Israel they thought he was going to be something then he wasn't time for him to be he was time for him to be a savior it was time for him to kill the stand of sin for me in you they thought he's gonna be a great general but they didn't rise he is a great general he is a great warrior that's the only reason he defeated sin that's the only reason he defeated Satan that's the only reason he took the keys of death he loved it because he was a general he was God Almighty and if you notice she lost her respect for him at first even the circle was saying Lord God and after wife said she began to say God anything's a god brother Donny but there's only one Lord God by the town and that's Jesus Christ she would give us a guard just like him that disrespect that's what happens people fail to receive the lordship of this message he said everybody wants him to be their healer everybody wants to be their Savior but very few will any be Lord and until we get to the place they be Lord we ain't connected right we're messed up she even begin to say God so you could say neighbor before that if you read the whole that it was Lord God Lord God Lord God Lord God not once when this happened God see that's Rudy is he said well I believe he's God but is he Lord God that's why they don't care if you say oh don't miss the name of Jesus you can pray you can say God just don't don't put a name on him I said what's wrong with the Lord Jesus Christ God now I say he's got a name he's got a name oh yeah father son hope he's got a name you got a name I got a name if you just sign the check down our Father they're not going to catch it if I sign it sign they're not going to catch it but you put your name down that Lord Jesus Christ or Richard Dale Douglas they'll cash it if I got the sufficient funds that's what Jesus did he come and wrote his name on the check and gave it to brother Louise he said you catch it I got sufficient funds now after the blood of Jesus Christ to the through Calvary I'll give you the pile áfourá t over the devil hallelujah oh that kid and then guess what the fellowship they walked with him really done oh how wonderful it is what would it come down every evening just like this afternoon everything walk are you doing having a good day oh it's your presence they never hid from him before brother Donny boy this God did he give him you'll become gods they become gods all right not that God warning this is what he said this is his the house number and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden who's ever heard who's never seen a voice walk he was walking they heard his voice he was talking to him where are you I've never run he's here now Eve Wow it's and they see him but rush never sits in man is running say I saw God no you did he sought you he sought you he just woke you up said look you're mine I got claims on you and they heard the voice of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and had him and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord amongst the trees of the garden you know sometimes we can't see therefore horse we can't see the forest because of the trees just because you're standing before you said couple trees rubbish you ain't seen the whole forest yet he thought it was nothing was hid from him he knew he didn't see what this that's the question who told you he knows nothing he was wanting to confess see that's the way it is that's what's hard for a man to do brother Anees admit he's wrong and confess it he was he had the atonement he had the price paid he was show her yeah oh you got to do is just say I messed up Lord but he said you know that ha ha ha ha boy you give me a boo-boo when you give her to me mm-hmm he's passing the blood well she didn't stink away later she said hey you know that guy that beast he made me do it we're fixin read who really made you do it mmm come here Sam closes last your own last see become last one and they all got cursed for Adam he couldn't touch his original creation cursed the Beast never hey you'll never see a serpent talk again if you do you own some kind of drug never seen one talk all I ever seen dude stick his tongue yeah try to bite me I've never liked him since neighbor Tony say hey would you kill that black snake why I said cause he's in my yard I don't like him I just didn't want him to do it I didn't trust him he bites he still bites he bit her he still bites he lost his nature yet he still got that nature to bite you hmm and then they will pass it on down but let's let's look over here let's turn over to the book of the first John let's look at this just for a minute first John chapter 3 let's turn over here look at these things let's look at what happened watch al other scriptures don't you he said listen he said Behold what manner verse one first John chapter 3 but what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God putting us back in our position sons not service sons hmm that we should be called the sons of God we're of the world knoweth us not because it knew him not they knew him they wouldn't kill him he said beloved now we are now we are you know what people have problems that brother Louise well when I get there I'm Oh son you already son you ain't going there if you ain't a son now you ain't going here go be one people say old words he's didn't become content in the war he was already gone that didn't make him God don't want your baptism makes you a son of God hmm that's just outward confession of an inward work the lamb had to be washed to be sacrificed just like us if it receives a sacrifice of God always was well now are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is won't be no blinders then won't be hold it will see him for what he really is we're seeing that's what this message come to do to see Jesus for who he really is it says an every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as his pure without that hope you're not purified within yourself that has to be there everyone has to be connected he said who said we commit a sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sin and in him is no sin the Bible said he became sin that didn't say he's saying said he became our sins that we might become the residence of God he says whosoever abideth in him sin it's not he said whosoever sinneth have not seen him neither known him you've not been connected you've not been born again hmm he said little children let no man deceive you there's a lot of deception trying to go around but he's telling us don't let him deceive he's coming he's not saying anything gonna be here brother Bob he's telling he's coming but don't even see him go right back to the scripture go back to the message Ben ain't there ain't no good but Branson don't believe me believe the word he said fit ain't in the word don't believe me he said Ben didn't believe this the Bible was the truth hardly say when they asked him brother man and a few countless never even have ties this way we're dead he said well the scripture tells you he said if that angel told me any other things wasn't in that Bible I wouldn't believe it he said why I believe it comes in the Bible not discuss an angel told me because it's in the Bible hallelujah glory to God he said let no man deceive you he that doeth righteous this is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning and then his son Cain did the same thing and it ain't stopped the nature the wiring hmm some of us needed some of us need to reboot that's a repelling of the Holy Spirit we need a we need a new hard drive because we had the wrong hope we started out with the wrong hard drive the wrong nature he said he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whomsoever is born of God does not commit sin that me on this I can't don't commit saying this this man I here's your unbeliever just got here he's the one keeps nowhere and I forget about you I'm not worried about what you think that's what the work things so that's what we're battling with this man but brethren we're trying to perfect him and he ain't gonna get perfect what we need to do is make him subject to the word you know how you making exceptions it works just feed him word we can't give him a little bit of the world here a little bit of the world and the next day and expect the overcoming that's what he feeds on you know how you keep him you know yet can't keep him under control you're starving you don't need to worry he can't eat a word I like what my pastor said about this this guy had a dog he had a dog in and it was just petting these in the houses look how its dogging he's this his buddy and everything he said but he's going by the pet store one day this guy was then he bought a parrot and he brought that parrot home and that dog hated him he said he hated that parent he said

over next day open that cage up listen but he said he went back because the guy got there at the pet store say what kind of days i hain't said quit feeding him RIT baby he said so they said so I didn't feed him one day later mighty steel back it's alright still next day didn't feed him brah next day he didn't feed him fourth day he didn't even bark in that bird he the end that broke him see that's what we gotta do we gotta break this man he desires the things of this world so quit feeding him so I've got so much trouble my flesh quit feeding him he hungers for those things quit feeding the black dog he's gonna keep grabbing long as you feed you beat him all you want to you can beat him over the head you run your head you can crawl on all the stones you want to light all the counts you want to didn't work for the Catholic see or for you I mean self-inflicted things even Martin Luther no closer to God I did was always sore oh ma but he's telling us here he said who said was born of God did not commit sin for he stated remains in him and it cannot sin because he is born of God in this world children of God are manifest and the children of the devil who severed doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so well I'm uh I'm a Christian but you don't love your brother what's wrong with you Hey he said even even the sinners do that brother ball even the sinners my loved one enough he said I want you to love your enemies if you can't love your brother who you go to church with your sister you're going with Church would forget about trying to love your enemy hey you ain't got you ain't got one wire hooked up yet you forget about going hooking the other two up you get that one hooked up start loving you brothers and sisters then you get hooked up to Jesus just like your supposted and get the power coming through like you do it then your loves and your enemies you can't do it this man can't love anything that's against him only the Holy Ghost brings him Tyler he's the bridle you go oh thank you Jesus he was freaking open his big mouth stick his foot in mmm but he brothels this man you know what I work with a guy man he hated me for some reason I couldn't figure out why he hated mr. bad I've never done nothin to him brother he hated me he said I just can't stand that guy he thinks he's so self-righteous I never said anything to him I mean everything you know what I said well what am I gonna do well do brother Chancellor we're not going to he said do good to him so you know where I start behind his launch of brain stuff well that made him madder never Wow I said boy he really hates me now he said you ready go buy your way into him I said no but I sure was trying to make it easy on you he never did he just couldn't do it and I never know but you know what I was sitting there one day at work and I was thinking about that thing I said watch this man hate me so much he said if you serve the world he'd love you simple trusting all over the world he hates you because he's not of me it's that nature self if you don't get connected right you ain't go yeah I loved him forgive him he had invaded me to do but I still loved him I couldn't figure out why I did I said every time back in the old days we went round around we went running around when I was with love one another we'd hug one another one of us passed out but that ain't cantaloupe got talking about people said I can't wait to give that brother piece of my mind sir space if you ain't getting under waste I can't give something you ain't got he said let this mind is in Christ be also in you don't don't waste your car on mine oh one another you ain't got none to waste I know I don't I don't mind he'd hold my Peter hore piece of my mind in trouble what yours is God's man you think like God live like God it takes God to live in got a bit wide right show us show us these things your seed came you came can't see ain't cause that seed remaineth in you let's look at let's look at these things and he tells us over let's turn back to st. John chapter 2 first John chapter let me say let's look at this right here let's see what calls the problem here let's started let's look at verse 15 you read 15 down through 4 17 here's John speaking to us again he said love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father's not in it you said well I still love such as this I don't know no war near I still got things down but Louise still playing he's dying I'm dying daily but I don't love it like I used to know what it was easy for me to quit loving the world if it ain't easy for you quit loving the world my goodness you got a huge birth it was easy I meant I look murder killing you can't love this this place does not not mine your home he said we're big rooms of strangers seeking for a city whose builder makers God we're not this is not my house I may have a nice place to live we might have a nice car drop his name my home I'm just traveling through we would get that kind of answer you don't we're traveling through and we want to bring others with us he's been he said love not the world neither love to the things of the world it sees you for paper quit loving the world but the things of the world buzzed on him that's why we have problems so I quit nothing but the things of the world things of the world what's that things that keep you from fellowship and God is to eat it Paul said it's not two great big things it's the little bitty things it's the little things but chance we leave undone it's the small foxes pause and survive it's that little bug that little parasite that bites on it mmm he said lot the world listen what he tells you these three attacks that he did on her list of this he said let me sit before all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life it is not of the Father but of the world he said in the world passes away and the lust thereof but he did abide that he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever what's the will of God his word let's look at what he did right here look at this see she fell right forward he don't Satan don't ever change they've got the same old tack what you gotta do study him you've got a steady meat on that he's not in you he don't brain your brain in a different way but it's the same old tactics same old desire to do what he did look at this let's look in back in Genesis right here listen to this verse 6 when you know that talk about man woman flesh like this he says that when the woman saw that the tree was good it was good for food it was the lust of the flesh she failed listen ideas and then it said and that it was pleasant to the eyes my point God beautiful ain't that beautiful mmm lust of the eyes and look at that the pride of life and to make one wise ever learning never come in man's been learned ever since knee ain't never come to God if it had been they've got him don't come to him he don't ever come to go what did this an Asian do this age was said under miserable wretched blind and naked and North it not so we have needed nothing we're rich and increasing goods you don't have Jesus if a man gain the whole world loses so what's the game nothing listen to such terrible to the Luke let's look at let's look at the one that can wire us right back he went they hey he said he was tempting all like manner still attempted no like man I won't hold you too much long let's just look at these things just sometimes to pinch our conscience and you go back and look at him instead him and Luke chapter 4 verse 1 they said well I'm gonna cross him if I cross to everybody else up Saints I'm gonna cross him up I've made every one of them fall by one of these three tactics and they did it brother Han they did it and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost he'd never got it connected to that he was in for a treat brother Louie's full full of the Holy Ghost we returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit in the wilderness you would think well God wouldn't lead him to that why would God do that he was gonna prove something then it's not by might not by power but by my spirit sister long he said being forty days tempted of the devil when the amp like we said this morning Satan kind a the tenth of all tempters he come there bass had failed to him everybody main state look like judgments won't be so perfect but he lied he said don't tell him Scheepers to me herd cattle what's the palm nation to the chip chest and judges looked smallest and he looked that was all but that one thing but disconnected one thing disconnection hallelujah it says being forty days tempted to their can imagine that forty days we can't longer came last thirty minutes Oh preacher they can help me he'll show you how it's not by my not my party's gonna show you what to do you can say don't even waste us don't even waste of power on this coward hmm he says in those days she did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered but brent said when a man's hungry he'll kill you get food he'll do anything to feel that section of the flesh look at right here he comes to attack him with the lust of the flesh he's waiting I got him he's hungry oh yeah just worked on all of them they got hungry wasn't this it said and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread he could have couldn't make the whole mountain of bread if he wanted to he could turn Satan into a dough ball if he wanted to gobble him up I mean I wouldn't want to eat him but the foul was a BT few buzzes were the probably feasted on him you know it says in jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God he defeated him when he tried to attack him with the lust of the flesh he to feed him with the word Rosalie's he said all right mother said you'll see where a man's that getting the word test is that pretty good quotes a second of giving us a quick quote to us brother oh Jesus pretty good didn't work cuz I Know Who I am see that's the problem a lot of us don't realize who we are then what Satan gives us a quote like it Oh but again hmm but man shall not live by bread alone ever words to proceed on the month ago they didn't stop don't think it's gonna stop me look you beat him one time he's coming he's coming what the lust of the eyes look at this and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed him unto him all the kingdoms of the world in the moment of a time while he was running that film when he that's yours man you got it I'm giving it to you and the devil said unto him all this power I will is it will I give thee and the glory of them for it is delivered unto me it wouldn't lie they ain't no glory in this place no more exist without Jesus he said delivered unto me and to whosoever I will give it listen all you're gonna do is listen to me say look Jesus look at this this is all yours you won't have to go to Calvary you won't have to do those things you people won't hate you they love you just keep kissing the babies shaking hands you'll be I don't bring the word to them I'll give you this time and the glory that worship you come on now no so ever I will give it if thou therefore will worship me he was getting personal wasn't he worship Me and all shall be thine hmm listen to this and jesus answered and said unto him get big get thee behind me Satan for it is written he wasn't calling him God you said I'm fixing to tell you about you I've had enough of you think he was getting irritated with him right here he said get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve see he was bringing by the connection to lordship look here yeah you're a god yet years of God to see ways but I'm not gonna worship here like the three Hebrew children be like the three Hebrew children we won't be in we won't bow and we won't burn sometimes God makes you fireproof and sometimes God walks with you hmm hey man I'm thankful that ain't you hmm they didn't stop it's all right unless the eye isn't where I get his pride my friend got to get him everybody fell for this one I always save the best for last Satan says I got him here that's what he thinks in this thing's I've saved them I've got the best now but tears over you ain't got a chance just give up just worship me sittin in synagogues got me in worst Vesco he is that's one of us to try the spirit no worse a gun and he brought him to Jerusalem right there he's taking me where I took him to Jerusalem he know what he was doing he knew that was a place where God was gonna bring that healthy City out look I'm gonna give it to you you won't have to worry about no getting life I got him down and brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a plant on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be who he's getting personal now the son of God cast I sat down from his for his written you don't think you use quotes on your scriptures it was all I can beat him was cursing though you angle outsmart him you got has the Holy Ghost with you ain't gonna beat him he can pump him back at you fast and you spit him at him he's illegal is talking about it says for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up least at any time thou shalt dash thy foot against a stone when jesus answered and said unto Him it is sad thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God Wow are we not amateur Yas then tell Satan don't you tempt me you don't have no rides see what we don't realize he don't have no right to us we give him access to our minds and then he tries to mess the wiring up lieutenant he's he's not a real electrician he just wants to hook you up oh he's just a quick job on you and look what he did for even him he did a quick job but it didn't work Jesus said I got it made though I got I got I'm already with it now didn't beat him with that couldn't beat him he couldn't because he was the Word made flesh couldn't defeat God and then he didn't defeat him with his power he could defeat his Satan anytime he wanted to with his power but he didn't have the pie he didn't wasn't here to put on a show for Satan and Satan will tell you brother Louise you know you really believe use a preacher I'm used brother Louise he's my buddy he knows I'm not belittling me thing brothers if you really was a mess or God you'd see more healings in your mastery you're just not really a son of God you're just to put off and you know if you prayed more brother you know your prize you really who every time you pray God ain't nothing yet what makes you think he's going to a detail brother Graham same time look your eyes your daddy's dead Brian look at dad as your wife not anymore all this is happening you're gonna serve a card like that he's challenging this right now is the showdown they said you really believe this message you really believe this come on now I don't believe you really believe it then why aren't you doing the work serving why aren't you I am I'm overcoming throw him mmm we didn't get behind a second we don't have time for you we don't have time for your loud mouth we don't have time for your ridicule look at what Ephesians will tell us Ephesians 4:29 tells us that what the positive wire has and he wounds us these days fort when I said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth then you start missing your wire if we can't say nothing good about one of the boys tennis keep your big fat mouth shut I was just studying and what we don't realize during the testing time when God is testing menu that's when the teacher is the quietest he's not talking he's waiting on you to pass the test so he'll feel at home and my prayers ain't going nowhere he's waiting to see if you really believe in what you're asking for he said you have not because you ask not you know when you ask us to miss Oh God I knew you wouldn't do it yeah because you didn't believe you would don't blame it on him we can't blame God cuz he challenged you have not cuz yes not he said who's ever believeth and ask anything in my name the beginning that's what he's connected to this man who said wait a minute didn't happen when I thought it would so it don't matter what I think it is it's gonna happen because I believe it then hmm just like me with needing the van you know I was was praying you know how cars flying out and I wore my pole car out driving it everywhere trying to go somewhere you may get down my grandson that's with my daughter Leah women my grandson's woman we pray brother Louise and pray Lord give dad a man help him get a van Siringo had lord help me you know brother

Sonny's brother chance you understand that don't you he did really he'd give you something to keep you out of church come on man let's don't blame God because you deserve something you weren't able to pay for and you've had to work more but don't you know gotta provide what you mean when you need it how you need it because he said take no thought from the god of tomorrow oh you'll already be enough it won't work brother Louise hey you gotta come gossamer by the way you got to be hooked up you got to be connected and God sent the Holy Ghost to connect us right he sent the Holy Ghost to dissolve that negative wire that we have all the time always negative that's what was wrong with his apostles it was negative that was negative they couldn't get along this is the process of what would Jesus but they didn't have the Holy Ghost so show us Lord who in here comes James and John's my lord which one's gonna be the greatest left who is one which one that one Centon wants that long the other here's the Apostles that we looked up to and all that with how to converge you look at the powerful and this is Lord and they wouldn't receive us shall we go find out I said you ain't know what spiritual what's wrong with you profess it as long as there's breath in the man's body there's a potential so we're really disagreed and put them on hapless tears I'm cool hey we got hey hey God have mercy on me I'm gravy and say hey you dropped it this time razor this over with you get your stinking higher and he could have he could he could do us anyway we hate we can't do without him he can put me in your way anytime he wants to him be just but he's patient with us he's long-suffering he's kind and then look when the spirit did fall on the pastas and it fell upon a man called Stephen he was connected he was hooked up he never backed down he never compromised he pressed the truth and it cost him his life he said gee stiff neck and circumcised are hard in the ears he always resist the Holy Ohr they loved it when he's talking about Abraham but he said he put you stim harden them hard he always resist ah I begin to stone him he didn't get messy Lord sent fire down Bernie's people of so don't place charge to him I never I had that happen to me times gone I had that happen to me and if it God's not in there you'll be negative cuz you know what we got so much gods give us so much understanding he's give us an atomic bomb I could pull the plug on that thing and blow anybody up anybody that way if you want to or you can blow people up take that same heating blow your brother sits up with it we do it this message is atomic bomb but it's made for the devil and his angels it's not made for your brother's system and anytime you can blow them up and you can tell us so much made hey I've had people to preach it where people say man I don't even know if I got the Holy Ghost on I said well my goodness brother I hate to think I'd make people disbelieving in the Holy Ghost

everybody says your attitude breath test can determine people's destination I hate like I said somebody here comes my son rotten filthy at it you you can do that you can present this mess in such a way and it's been done that way brother Terrence you know that y'all brothers been here long in a long time I've seen it happen a people resent the wrong way brother and they call people to walk away

Braun Jesus is so real to us to make us love me if we don't do that we failed but Bry said there's three things that every Minister brother Han should have in his ministry he said that's faith hope

what about town that's where you really want me to answer that I said you really I wasn't I was backing off I just said really do you want me to answer that and then they called me up said we got questions and then when he wants you to pray but rich they call you up you're the one who can't leak all you pray I said know it Richard if your dad asked you your prayer and then asked me I said let's try now then I said well I don't give you in Walmart I don't care it doesn't matter me I'm not ashamed to God I don't care what they think about me they don't bother me one bit I prayed in Walmart huh good baby stops prayed and people getting homework what calls me it's cause he comes he demands respect but she his wife called me and she said honey I got a hard question I don't asked you yeah I know I want to ask you a question do you believe in women preachers or deaconesses Wow boy you throw the whole barrel at me I thought whoa and I knew they did I said I said do you really want me to answer that question I said I won't answer it but I answered by God's grace he'll give me the by the Bible because you could have quoted brother Branson they wouldn't live what that was but you know what if they're really believers they should believe the Bible we were pleased we believed them I was lonely so take the Bible take the balanced short-term that's what brother showed us the port was in the Bible so I said okay I'll do the best I can God give me grace and so God took me in I said where you know live Capri sitting there was a woman she said what about Deborah said she's a judge and said transcript boy she judged you know she wouldn't she never had a friend said what about Mary Magdalene she held a fine lot she went back preach to the pastor's I said no she didn't they said go tell I said not preach to go tell my disciples I said before and the Lord was just open these things as soon as this young minute scriptures just flowing he said how did your belly shall flow rivers of living water they've just description I wouldn't he it is like I turned the Bible blood on it fall right on the scripture that's like you know yeah I know it's not me but we can't do that when God wants to talk he talks and where he speaks it's through his word and so I told her I said well you know Paul said oak learn tempted when I won't teach to have thought of them happy silent Church I can hear a growling on the end she said what about this I said well how could she be the husband of one wife well that Curt him once she said that you know next thing she told me you're a male chauvinist pig she told me I was a pig oh I said that dress I'd rather be a pig but you know what I said got mad brother sir I didn't get mad I felt a head for it hurt me I wept in my soul and when they hung up you know what I did it wasn't me doing that brother Amy said Father forgive if we can't have that kind of love brother Brett said as we stand Robin said if we don't have said only the bride only the bride will show mercy said you're looking for mercy the pride of habit you say your bride and you're condemning your brother to hell and your sister's a hill and you're trying to put everybody inhale that's not Brian you're not connected yet but let me tell you if you'll just let a master electrician work on you he knows how to tweak it like brother riches knows how to tweak that on them computers him and brother here my brother Joseph veneer I don't know about it I mess it up how'd you leave everything in there I said push the button I push it oh just one I don't have that no more I say yeah I don't know that but say god knows how to tweak you and there was that turning that's when you get a little when your wire gets a little loose and you kind of you ever seen a lot when it flicker stuff anything it balances oh my there it is either your balance is messed up are your wires loose but let me tell you Jesus will straighten you out he knows how to diagnosis he said waiting that now Richard you you balance all wrong in the world let me put this balance right here and when he applied this in my heart and I rightly divide the word until he puts that Holy Ghost in your heart you'll never rightly divide the word God and he hooked my wires up and guess what he said you'll be alive he'll be alive let your light shine before me he even told Peter he said Peter when you're converted when I get you connected I know you're wow you've got real zeal Peter I love you I prayed for you eat love Peter Peter wasn't going to hell he was just needed the Holy Ghost hmm he didn't even hold against me I didn't deny him walk with Him denied him rest on fleed Peter stood around and come back to even take a look but he said we know you're you know what retention he's never can't deny Jesus when you're a real son of God even when I was out in the world and say somebody you boy it's different than the others that must be gone it scared me to death but it was him he was on the inside they seen something I can see Satan told me I went too far she said didn't go far enough when he got ahold of her why he said I'm looking at you now I said lord I want it now and he hooked me to the rice plots he brought forth his worth and He healed me ever hit by a rock clubs know something like God if there's like any connection in my life between me and you our fellowship our
