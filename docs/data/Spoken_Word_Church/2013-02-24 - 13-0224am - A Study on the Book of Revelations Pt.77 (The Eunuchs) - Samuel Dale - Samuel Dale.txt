word and you'd speak to our hearts and our lives that we may Lord see you living among us forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us may our hearts be Set On You Lord and may Our Lives make that manifest that the world may see we love you and we thank you for all things we commit it now to you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now we'll read Revelations 14 like verse 1-5 we got part of it Wednesday but then we want to continue on through these other couple of verses and I looked and L lamb stood on Mount s with him and 144,000 having the father's name written to their foreheads and I Heard a Voice from Heaven say voice from Heaven as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of Harpers harping with the their hearts and they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no and no man could learn that song but 144,000 which were redeemed from the earth these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb withs soever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto God and to the lamb and in their mouth was found no G for they are without fault Before the Throne of God you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we won't try to back up too much on the Wednesdays but we have no problems as we said Wednesday seeing who this group of people is you know some places in there you could read and it would maybe uh say something and you would wonder but emphatically States two times there verse 1 and verse three that this is the 144,000 of the children of Israel right this is the same ones that we see over in Revelation 7 and but to me this is giving a better or more clearer definition or understanding because in Revelation 7 you list 144,000 and you have uh Dan and Ephraim missing and the prophet said when you come to re Gans the 14th chapter that that is the 144,000 back in perfect tribal order with Joseph and Levi uh taken out and Dan and Ephraim put back showing the Redemptive plan of God Amen you see no wonder then as we read there in the scripture that they sang a new song as it were it says a new song all right it's the song of redemption but it's not the same how would you said I tried to get across Wednesday uh the verses you know would be it would be different verses to this song than there is to our song which is the redeemed amen you know we are the children of God the redeemed you know and and we have the Bible says we can sing a new song cuz we do you know our song is no longer like it was in the world but now it's in Jesus Christ and we have a new song but then they sing because their Plan of Redemption is not exactly like ours because even though it gives them eternal life here in the world right they're still not the children of God right and we'll get back to that in a minute they are the servants all right and but yet still they can sing that song and I tried to emphasize like you know that each age has songs you see you you had the the the song like Wesley them of the blood you know a lot of songs were written in that day about the blood well that was the day and the hour that was the time that was the that was the song they were singing of redemption right all right then you come on over into the the Pentecostals and you begin to sing you know about how that we were one of them and and all the different songs wrote by Pentecostal people and the one is especially writing a lot about Jesus you know and emman and all like that but then when you come on over into the message of the hour see look at the songs that are being written by the people you know the token the different songs that the people this message sing related to right this hour right see so you can see I was trying to illustrate that's that's a new song each age receives a song or writes songs and sings about the Redemption of their age and their time amen all right so then your 144,000 would not sing the song of redemption as the bride right that would not be their song see but it would be the song of redemption but it' be according to where the Redemption made them servants instead of you know making them Sons and Daughters of God all right then that was you know hoping that would you would follow that along and then when we get into this now today I want you to notice something that Lord Jesus notice what they're called yeah in in our message today we would deal with the fact of the Bible covering them to be virgins we will deal with the fact of them being servants right we will deal with the fact of them being the remnant of the Jews all right then brother Brandon will pick it up and call them Unix no and and bringing it on over into another form and God would call them then the chosen of the Lord that would that would tie together all the scriptures and and even though they're not the bride of Christ they are the chosen right they're the predestinated right group of people and we'll get down to it in the message in a minute they they're a special Elite group of people this 144,000 that we've been talking about they are the Elite of God you know that that won't be shameful to get there and we won't look down on them I want to make sure to emphasize one thing to you we we have thought about the 144,000 and and the prophet as we'll read in a minute and and a lot of times we just refer to them to being servants well you know uh that would be like you know that you you've got a servant and you tell the servant to go do this or to go do that you know but I I believe that's not the emphasis upon the word servant of the 144,000 you know all right it would be a great opportunity to be able to qualify right for this group of people amen you know I mean out of all of Israel there's going to be 144,000 chosen but we know they were chosen before the foundation of the world but they have a specific position or place position or whatever you want to call it right to exist in and that's a wonderful position and it's not like a servant that you know right uh brother Brady and them if you remember they used to work for these people that the queen would come over and you know they were like servants but he said one time he said we didn't consider ourselves to be low form no you know right they sure didn't no we didn't consider ourselves to just be nothing nor right he told me a many of time that that the guy that where he stayed at that he would you know he would talk to him and argue with him about something one time he was telling about that that they you know they were servants and they didn't get to full Porter House State and you know they would get the trimming and what was left over maybe a different type of mistake but the old dog that they had got the Porter House steak you know he got his own cook for him because he was part of that yeah but he said one day then he just wound up and something happened and the dog was killing chickens I don't remember the whole story but he wound up killing the old dog you know well the the master didn't jump on him and scream at him he just he just said the dog's dead you know to the master to the dog dead well he didn't argue with him about it he figured he probably you know had a reason for killing it but what I mean is brother said we didn't feel like that we were right lower class people you know see even the word servant we go down to a to a restaurant and and make sure you do that brother R said make sure you pay those wages and and you know you tip them when you go tip them good because that's their job you and see that's a servant but they're being paid for those jobs so there's all kind of the word servant that's right but the main thing I want us to see today is that you can call them virgin you can call them unic you can call them servants you can call them Remnant you can call them chosen you you got many names for this 144,000 and they have a beautiful position oh yeah there you know in the Lord for you and I and that's what we'll we'll try to get to and to see the point but as I was saying Wednesday then these these people here don't count them as to be a low class or they're our servants well now you won't be there right I'm just going to put it plain right if that's the way you think that they're your servants boy we're going to lay back and they're going to serve us now you show me where brother Brown talk like that that's right you know you show me that right see to be paid to be a servant is a livelihood right right you know a waiter Etc but what about when you get eternal life it right there what about eternal life and a special place set aside for you that nobody else can obtain under that that's right and they can't even sing the song about it that's something is it when don't we get down in the scriptures a little bit you know I'm try to try to cover it but just think now Revelations 14 I got it in there for them to bring up but we don't have to bring these couple up to save a little time Revelations 14:4 the you don't have any Scripture Let Me Maybe I rephrase it it could be something linking together but you don't have a scripture that just calls you 144 th000 Unix right right that's the point I want you to get because that's like when the minut when we say they're Unix then you're going to throw your mind into a gear of thinking about you know what they are but see the Bible says they're virgins the Bible says they're they're servants the Bible says that they're The Remnant well let's don't even think about when we get to the word unic as to be a sterile person you know someone that's incapable of bearing children and see then that's like I said Wednesday you get into those things until people will even say well you know you got to be married to preach yeah well Jesus yeah didn't have a natural wife so we just disqualified him and then Paul says I got a right to marry but I won't we'll give you these at the end and you start getting into all of those and it comes from some man's ideas or thoughts you know down through that we take and it's because of certain ways things are said or something like that but let's get into the scriptures of it and just see what we're talking about now as I made the statement you can go see from Revelations 14 and it calls them virgins and it says they follow the lamb withs soever he goeth right says these were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto God and to the lamb right amen see then when we refer to first fruits a lot of times we try to make that bride see that's why that you know you you've got all kind of doctrines about the Book of Revelations because you get over into the Gentiles and look at it as first fruits but then when you read first fruits here you say this is first fruit it's bride yeah so then you got all your doctrines at that 144,000 with the bride you know and the the the British Israel doctrines and and the things that that come in there but keep it in the correct order and you'll find out they're true virgines amen all right keep it in true order and you'll find out in Revelation 7 that you seal these Servants of our God in their fourheads all right now you remember how we were trying to bring that out about the forehead see the foreheads where your understanding is you know intelligence part communication Etc is in your for forhead all right and see then the mark of the beast is in your forehead because that's a Doctrine right but now remember that this point you can't be on both sides right all right right we either have the Seal of God or we have the mark of the beast right amen all right it's one of the two it's not no no uh gray area but remember how we tried to bring it out Wednesday because this is what I I I believe that see Martin Luther in his soul had eternal life amen sealed in by the Holy Spirit he had the Seal of God Amen but in his intelligence he was still a trinitarian that's right all right and even said the Jews were to be taken out and destroyed you know or something like that because he was a human being under that period of time right of the man you know of the the combat Beast right and not under the end time right see you tell him you today you say well the Jews ought to be killed I say well you got a problem brother sister you need to repent right because what we're talking about here they're going to be so close to us in the Millennium amen right until you going to be telling them they ought to be killed and they go over in the Millennium and they're guarding you right or your escorts or your servants or your whatever y all right Martin Luther under that time God would not account those things to him because it was Intelligence parts of him that was working well you and I you and I can have within our human intelligence understanding doctrines um whatever you want to call it we can still have denominational ideas we'll get back to a minute on it see yep but these these 144,000 they don't have any right well we better be that way or there's not going to be over there right right it's all it's all based on whether or not we can come to a place Amen to be virgins in our understanding amen and you say well brother Dale how do we get rid of you got to first know you got it amen we we used to be in the I always have told you believed in one God but I explained it as God in three persons Blessed Trinity cuz I didn't know any other way to explain it right all right and see you can still be that today and then you see all these doctrines of the message that comes in of those 200,000,000 demons that is loosed on the bride of Christ that's right to drive her to the message of hour amen you say well you mean God like I tried to explain it the other day you know how those Jews being killed by the millions but that was God's tender hand that's right carrying him to the home right amen that's right amen why don't we count the heartaches and trials and Troubles of life as to be a an opportunity that God can use that to bring us to a place of you know submission or whatever we need right amen and all like that see why why can't we keep that in mind instead of trying to get everything so much that we're so great and we're so revelated you know what we're doing is just wait on y'all yeah you know well then everybody here gets the idea well we're just waiting on them out there that's on the internet system you know so we waiting on y'all it might be you and I that has the problem they might be waiting on you and I well I don't know about that brother Dale that be little in me well then you get your high down you know the turkeys you know they they say turkeys will just stand and look right straight up in the sky and drown you know little baby ones and they'll just stand there and it raining like everything and they'll just drown you know well maybe sometimes we need to get our head out of the sky get it back down on Earth and and you know tuck it under our wings and keep being drowned by our own thoughts and ideas okay but now listen we know that this is the same people of Revelations 14 as Revelation 7 but as I said revelation 7even is showing more or less the Earthly Journey the uh uh the bringing in of those and and then when you get into this Revelations 14 you're going to find Dan and Ephraim put back in and that's kind of a hard situation I tried to explain it for about 40 something years that what are you going to do with that other 24,000 you know cuz you got 24,000 more if you add Dan and Ephraim back in and you take Joseph and Levi out you're not going to take them out and leave them here right that's not the point is not to do that so we found then that and when we get there to the Millennium that Israel as is going to be Israel as a nation right so there could be a lot of Jews in the Millennium sure with Israel as a nation right that they can do we're going to be there on a honeymoon right amen and we'll have an escort not that we need protection but it's just part of the plan that the way that God designed it to be you know and it's going to be a wonderful time as I said a moment ago then we read this and say well the first fruit so we try to make that bride these are not bride right but you know they are first fruits right now you know why because they have eternal life that's right exactly because they receive eternal life here right amen see first fruits is bride yes that's eternal life but remember these 144,000 plus the two witness they receive eternal life here right amen all right so then there will be first fruits and they will follow the lamb whether soever he go but you know who's going to be with the lamb wherever he goes amen that's right the bride of Christ so it's going to be wonderful situation all right and they have the seal in their forehead the Seal of god so let's just take a few things and read now of what the prophet has said let's go ahead on down to number uh two brother I had these Wednesday and I didn't get down to them so I said we'll just continue this thought on Brother Anderson remember I'm Brother Anderson okay that's Joe Anderson back there anyway Anderson Joe eitherway want make it this is taken from the 10 virgins and 144,000 of the Jews you all right which preached in 1960 121 the morning service now that's the Seal of God we know that and remember there's only 144,000 of the Jews sealed right which was the remnant yep of the Jews left over all right see the remnant in the end time all right now but this but in this in the Gentile bride in the Gentile bride there was tens of thousands and thousand those that sealed in there because that's them Martyrs and things that come down Through the Ages there and they rise in the day of judgment but the Jew is the remnant of the Jews that's left over all right you know the remnant is the material you lay the pattern down you cut it out you make a dress there's the bride what's left around it there's right the right the material so in the bride so you lay it down and you you cut out the remnant and you got a foolish virgin left over Amen in Israel you take it and you lay down the people right and you got a Remnant to be done in the last days of the 144 th000 all right go ahead on up to number three this is taken from the Seal of Christ of the Christ 1955 uh 3:12 say the angels of God with destroying weapons coming forth to destroy the world and what did the Holy Spirit say hold the Four Winds hold the world war until the winds Means War all right okay see the same thing as woes all right this is This Global destruction hold it until we have sealed the Servants of our God in their forehead that's right the Gentile never was a servant right the Jews a servant Y and John recognized them every one of them 144,000 of the Jews it was Abraham my servant right thank you don't go back there and say Abraham my my son you see Abraham was a servant CU in the Old Testament they did not have eternal life in the the body of Christ amen that's right that wouldn't deal in the Old Testament until Jesus Christ would come right and bring eternal life then they could receive eternal life and then I said like the remnant see then you got the remnant part of Israel in the fact that Mary John Peter all of them Jews came into the New Testament right and that would be the remnant because it was only a small amount of people right and remnant of the Old Testament would come in and receive eternal life and be in the bride but to Israel as a whole they rejected that right these 144,000 reject that right right you know by uh how did you what you say the rep by representation of predestination because of what happened back there in in the time of Jesus Christ then that put all the Jews in that position see a man can stand day I never turned down Jesus why you accept him now then you won't quro like that you know you'll quit croaking about right the problem you accept Jesus Christ now and you'll see what happen that's right now you won't be blaming somebody else you'll see you're the fault I don't blame the Jews for Killing Jesus I don't blame the Romans for Killing Jesus cuz none of them killed him n it was my sin amen my sins is what hung him on a tree see not nothing like that all right now go on to number four a lot of this you'll find is from the Seal of God or the mark of the beast and thing so you can go back to that the Seal of God preach 54 5:15 now watch they can't do it in other words you can't have the atomic bombs falling the the wars the things see you got to spatial Wars and we will try to do a little more of that this evening I guess on the message but see it can't be done in other words you can't bring on an atomic destruction in the United States and things right now that's supposed to be after we get out of here all right now see they can't do it until the Jews get a visitation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right now see they get a visitation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right but it doesn't make them Sons and Daughters right and you know they're not going to be who are you I'm a Son of God who are you I'm a servant I don't like to be a servant n they're going to be tickle to death so is every Jew that winds up in the Millennium going be tickle to death be right right okay the angel said hold it right till we seal the servants not the Bri the Gentiles never was a servant we are Sons and Daughters of God that's the servants the Jews Abraham was God's servant he said Hallelujah right all right going on to the next then we'll begin to pick up some of the these things that what they're going to be called this is very familiar with us paragraph or page 41 of the church age book revelation of Jesus Christ now these 144,000 are not in the bride in Revelations 144 they are called virgins and they follow the lamb whether soever he goeth the fact that they have not defiled themselves with women shows that they are Unix now not because of a ceration you know an operation right we'll get to that in a minute he can read what brother R says that that was a custom that they done right we'll do it cuz I like to cover the whole thing but see according to rev Matthew we'll get to that in a minute 1912 see some are made Unix and some of this but some are Unix for the kingdom we'll read that in just a minute the Unix were the keepers of the bridal Chambers they were attendants no notice that they do not sit in the throne but are Before the Throne no they are not in the bride will but will be in the Glorious Millennial Reign right we then see we we read that one but leave this one out most of the time we then see that when these light of Israel have joined in love to the Lord and the enemy has been destroyed God will prepare His Holy Mountain his new Garden of Eden for the bride and his her attendance for the Thousand Years honeymoon upon the Earth as Adam and Eve were in the garden and did not finish out the Thousand Years now Jesus and Jesus our life Adam and his Eve true church will fulfill all the plan of God Amen all right well what are they going to be all right where where we at go ahead with number six oh we'll see what he what the scripture said about Unix for there are some Unix Matthew 1912 which were so born from their mother's womb that's normal and there are some Unix which were made Unix of men y you know they were castrated made Unix and there be Unix which have made themselves Unix for the kingdom of Heaven's Sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it amen if you can receive it then receive it listen to it some make themselves Unix some are made Unix by man and some people are born sterile as we call it not necessarily curated but get born sterile just to be plain we somebody out there won't argue with us over the wording but now listen our thoughts of Unix is something like that A Sterile person and they did have them that were guards are taking care of the queen you know and all of the Kings and they would have servants and things like that and they would naturally make them sterile because they didn't want them their wives you know all right but that's not true in every case CU like I said about Joseph see we called him a servant he was sold he was a servant to Piper and Piper's wife's trying to get him to go lay with her and sure proved he wasn't sterile that's right all and then you know he winds up and has at least two kids right so you know they would it ain't always that way it's what you're using the word unit for if you're using it for the natural things you deal up here but you're dealing with the spiritual part I'm going to go ahead and say it in case I don't get back to it ever born again believer in the body of Christ ought to consider themselves to be a unic right right we're not talking about natural things we're supposed to have one husband right we're supposed to be virgins right we're supposed to be servants the bride of Christ what's the problem Jesus not don't people would want you to use that word and they're using it word now to make him this that of there but you know he set himself aside for the Kingdom's sake right he was a unic he never touched women Paul was a unic read the scripture in a minute see well why can't we consider ourselves to be that we're supposed to have one husband we're supposed to be married to Christ we're not supposed to be out running around with all other things you say well Unix on men this men well where'd you get that idea from I thought women were supposed to be Unix too I don't like you use word unic about me well get what I'm talking about if you're a born again believer you're supposed to be all of these things set aside for the kingdom and to be married to Jesus Christ see they get away from the ideas of always just Unix is this that gets away from just the natural points of man all right go ahead to number six this is taken some questions and answers on Hebrews book 1 57 925 you notice over in Revelations there it said and they are virgins they are Unix now what was a unit now watch him give the definition but watch him explain it they were Unix were the temple guards that guarded the queen they were they were men that were made sterile he knows that but now is he talking about stir from here on what is he saying they did you notice that they had not defiled themselves with women that's why they're virgins right and that's why they're sterile they're Unix right they not defile themselves not that they got to be I use that word too much h see we get up all in our mind we oh we got that figured out well then you turn around like Paul and Paul said well I had a right to get married if I wanted to I won't do it well see then you come up with the idea like someone said well he was a member of the Sanhedrin so he had to be married well no no and Jesus certainly wasn't that right I remember some brothers one time and that told us or had this against this other this brother y that he couldn't be a pastor of a church because he wasn't married and I told him I said well Paul wasn't married Jesus wasn't married what are you going to do that brother R said a deacon don't make a deacon out of somebody that's single right he said they ought to be married where they will know how to rule the house of God right amen all right what do you see what I'm talking about yes see they were they were men that were made sterile H he's only typing it see and they did you notice that they had not defiled themselves with women they were Temple Unix and it was a selected number that God has taken out of the elect of the Jews a special people taken out of the very elect of Israel now if you'll notice if we could just get that just a moment so it's kind of settled in your mind where you can really H I think about it look at the next one this is paragraph that was paragraph 39 this is paragraph 74 of the same message watch of course I know you go back over here to the 14th you talking about Revelation 14 why they're with the bride whereever they absolutely Unix travel the unic travel with the queen wherever she went truly but what were they they were nothing but escorts and just exact that's just exactly what the Scripture decires it to be here right escorts right guiding it I mean you think we're going to get over and and I make things natural where nobody won't run off of the wrong thing and you think I'm too carnal but you think we're going to get over in the Millennium and worrying about somebody running around with somebody's wife right talking to a lady one day you know we talking about we get over there we be in a brand new body boy she just I mean you in the house she not to tell you to read her mind he's thinking about getting that slender body back you think we're going to have trouble in the Millennium we not have trouble now right amen watch as these Jews As We Lay It Down they're virgins they don't take no denominational do not dealing with whether or not they pure in body as you call it he talking about what they are in God look what Paul has to say about it in 1 Corinthians 7:7 I would that all men were even as I myself but every man ha his proper gift of God yep one after this man and another after that now if you back up read up and down you'll find he's talking about he's talking about a virginity and you know men have a virginity as well as a woman has a virginity right that's why Paul will say if it's given it's no problem but it's better to hold men are supposed to be virgin we're not supposed to be the HCHO muncho run around all the women you want to but we're clean that's what my mom used to say she said a man can go out and live with all the women he wants to put a suit on he goes to church he call brother he said woman go have one act say she classifi an adulter all the rest of her life cuz that's that don't work in the kingdom of God come on look what Paul said I say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as I and we'll read where Pro the prophet said that Paul wasn't married but if they cannot contain let them marry first better to marry than to burn that's why he say all can't receive it in his writings he's talking about what up above down below what do you read because a a wife is concerned about her husband and fulfilling the things of Duty of a wife of a husband is talking about wife fulfilling the duties of a husband and but see if you don't have a husband or a wife you can totally commit everything to God and see we always look at something you know we really you know somebody comes along doesn't want to get married and we think he must be feminist then a girl comes up don't want Mar she done something wrong she's done something wrong because she don't want to get married and let it be revealed now come on folks is that right they're trying to do their best for God to give their life to him but some can't some can't do that so it's better to marry than to Burning Love us so get married going be a bad world if some of us had got that's right I'm the baby of 13 I'm sure glad they didn't stop I wasn't a guy here but listen folks see you could be a unic for the gospel you can set yourself aside but once you married you got qualification right see some of the women come along and say okay brother Dale he's preaching we to be Unix TR I this remove myself from my husband you ain't you you got mental problems let alone anything else that's right the Bible says that even for a man to not fast unless he gets consent for his from his wife right CU lest he be tempted or she be tempted for his inconsistency do we need to explain that amen see the Bible's plain if you get married you're married amen well I'll just pull away I'll divorce my husband I'll divorce my wife now this become a unit no you're not doing it you already got a woman picked out or a man picked out don't talk to me too old you're already in your mind looking around you're trying to figure out some way to get it set up to where you can get married again well I've always said one thing you you marry one and and you get married again you just got two problems that's amen you say problems we're husband and wife cuz we have to live for God right brother told me one time he said so was going to have problems to get married I said everybody that gets married got problems you tell me me and my wife all of our Liv live together and never had an argument I don't like to call people Liars all right there's one thing for certain has happened either she's so submissive and so beat down but don't worry about it she sneak around the Y that's what sister barbar used to tell me how those Islamic women said they were under subjection I said they women I said you remember when y'all sitting around talking she started grinning you they just kept under subjection but listen folks I'm just trying to explain something trying to explain a unic but I want to be a unic for the Gospel of Jesus Christ cuz I don't want no more doctrin I want to be a virgin cuz I don't want no Doctrine I might not qualify naturally in human life but I can qualify in the kingdom and that way then you can be what God wants you to be right see but the husband and wife ought to be to the Bas that there you know there to be uh what you call it I'm not sympathetic that's the wrong word like I said a while ago you know about bad for being married and all I wouldn't throw anything against my wife's the greatest woman in the world and she tell you he's the greatest guy in the world but we we don't live we're not goody goody two shoes all over our lives either we've had our arguments and fusses and all like that but we get over it we just don't go around tell everybody else right right everybody else wants to go cry on somebody's shoulder you and my having problems what kind of problem well he told me that that that I didn't cook good my goodness go cook his what we call that problem brother Ernie was talking about you know brother Ernest was talking about brother around telling those women said that woman you know standing there said you come to be prayed for he said you're just going through to change of life right he said if I ask her to raise a hand said a lot of these women out here be going through to change of life well he wasn't going to quit and not pray for her but it was a normal part of life y man and woman live together long enough they're going to get in an argument they're going to have problems that's right but I've always told you my philosophy right oh yeah never go to B without saying I love you some of you men maybe go home you know and say well honey I don't tell you I love you and she'll say well you want a man right want get away what you trying to get what's going on you done done something wrong today no you're done been telling her all these years you love am it's a lot to be a Christian but to be two people and be a Christian right amen it's hard to be mad at somebody if they say I love you that's right you know you try it some sometimes right in the middle of a big argument just stop and say hey I love you don't talk to me like that what was it Gil when Nick asked her something coming up the road one day and she said he had to ask me on the way to the church asked me how much I owed on my credit card how much you ow on no credit card had to ask me on the way to the church I you wasn't meaning that wrong it's just a point I was laughing the other day these people I went to visit that we hunt with and the lady she said well they over here at these churches now said they just said they just go to church wear anything don't they I said yeah she said oh where we going other things to they just wear shorts and they wear pants well looking over that she was s there with pants on but see she she still had that she said you don't go to church wearing pants well see that was honorable you you'd laugh at her said what she sitting there with a home but that's honorable you know it's honorable right to go to church dress decent where brother R said your best be decent and everything and be honorable amen but we don't believe in doing something at home any different than what we do at church but still it was honorable for her to say that right see Church there's some good people in this world old fell come out and he said just keep right on pray I'm like we drug him out of the woods twice and ID up in ront end of a tractor and him already gone just about it I was going roll back his head one time and we pray for him he still tells everybody about it that's right you know but listen Church Paul was explaining a life a Christian Life that's it if you can not have no problems just don't get married you you don't have to get in this message now years ago it's not as bad now but some of you older ones that was around in the early early 60s like we were 68 right in there 60 768 said 70s if a girl wasn't married by the time she was 16 and had three babies time she was 20 she would something wrong with her that's right that's just the truth everybody was supposed to get married well we happened to be at these people's Place one time and uh GGY said something to the lady and I don't know where it was my conversation to her of one but she wound up saying to the lady you know said we don't believe in forcing you know pushing people to get married young she said but we do you know something to that degree but listen Church a unic is not one that has to be no seed there sterl it can be one set aside for the kingdom of God it can be one set aside for certain things some people just don't want to marry right now lot that they're married just look at them and think they're funny yeah but you know what they look at us and say they're funny so who's funny cuz there's a lot of people that don't want to get married well are you going to force them to no no because they can give their life to God Lord that's right I I wasn't made for that my wife used to tell me years ago said you need to you needed to stay single I said but I'm not made for that you notice when you come up them steps out there my office door is never closed if it is I'm in there asleep don't knock yeah door's closed on sleep that's right but you see at home you know the kids would be there with way my old study was right there beside the den she said we're hindering you well it didn't hinder me the kids come in and say Daddy can we go do something I said yeah I'll go ahead and do it you said well I ain't going to let my kids get to my study while I'm studying well okay I got no problems with you that's you I just made with an open door and I never was made to live alone that's right amen you remember the old Dallas movie where all the family lived in one house well I'd be satisfied if we had a big enough house whether could everybody have their part of the house and be welcome to stay there cuz that's just the way I am you all right but you're not that way well see that just for me that's just my way of being I can sit down in the study and one of the grandkids can come in there and just sit down right there and play and I can just be W notes and study and you know I no problem that's right cuz that's the way I'm made but everybody's not made that way I understand that everybody's not made to be set aside for certain things right and all but don't call all Unix right things right they got a pretty good position amen like I said you say well you got to have a you you you emphasize that you know the seed comes through the body and that's emphasized you know by people and the scripture the prophet saying the seed comes through the body see somebody carrying the seed down they had to be in the body to carry it down that's wonderful we know that's true right uh but if you got to have a seed to be able to carry that gospel you got a problem with Ethiopian unit that's right amen it went down Ethiopia and converted all that country right amen you had a problem there amen he was probably physically a unic MH sure but you know what he was too you check back and see if you'll find out he was the treasurer MH that's what he had done he had went up there to pay ties and do different things he was a Treasurer that was his job I even read up on a lot of things you studied a lot of things it and go on your computer and read it and you find out that that some of your um best opera singers are Unix because they actually make them Unix at a certain age the word you know how you you you remember how you were a kid I'm talking about do this but then you read a lot in there that you don't have to it ain't talking about being sterile either you know read a whole lot of it read it but you know how a kid when he comes along you know when you you say something when you kids he oh you know you know girls don't go through that boys do yeah but see then they do that and they make them Unix that pitch or that voice when they come up in their age they can sing opera that's right to the greatest read it up I when I get something a thought I look it up but also found that you don't have to be you know sterile to be called a unic right see it it's maybe your choice of what you want right but in the Kingdom we're to all consider ourselves to be right not wanting any other seed right from any other form and make ourselves Sons and Daughters of a living God these 144,000 are called virgins the prophets because they did not defile themselves with women right not meaning physically no that's right he didn't mean they couldn't have no children it doesn't mean they're not married right right come on but it means that they have set themselves aside when they heard the gosp when they hear the gospel of those two witnesses they will get away from all organized religion it be old mother hord or heart daughters or whoever it is they're going to get away from it righten why because they're setting thems aside right y they come to a great thing a great position that's right as we read there a moment ago about the prophet saying that they were chosen let's read these fights and then I got a few comments I want to make on something that might be interested in the scriptures brother around says on questions and answers on Genesis 53 729 number 10 on your notes Brother Anderson he's talking about Paul Paul said now here I know I preach the gospel that's my duty I'm a preacher he's a Preacher Brother Neville is a preacher but it that's our duties to be a preacher well that's just what we're supposed to do but let me do something Paul said that's beyond that now I got a right to take up money Paul said now he's explaining life right all but I'm going to make tense just to show you I can sacrifice he said it's honorable marriage is Honorable among all the bed's undefiled it's good for a man to be married he said I got a right to be married now I could be married I got a legal right to be married but it just won't get married I want to do another service to the Lord see then he said every man knows his calling let him do as SS Unix for the word of God's sake Y and so forth we want to do something beyond our duty now listen to us right if you really if you're really born again of the spirit of God and say that's my duty to go to church see when you get to the point that you got to go yeah and you don't count it a love a fire then you might as well stay at home that's right that's right right why because it's doing no good right that's right that's my duty to go to church I guess I'll have to go oh my well I want to do more than that I want to win some souls for Christ I want to do something I want to visit the sick or do something for him it's my duty to preach the preach funerals it's my duty to preach the gospel it's my duty to pray for the sick let me do something else let me get out and do something where God will honor Me by it right am all right lamb and a dove number 13 1960 805 paragraph e49 Dove and lamb while you're listening the most while you're listening the most outstanding scriptures one of them that I can think of when Jesus said father think of it father for their sake I sanctify myself greatest scripture he could think of right think of it father for their sake I sanctify myself what was he doing setting the example he was a lamb what did he do he had a right to a home he was a man he had a right to be married he was a man now you understand what he's saying you want to quote where brother R said Jesus was even tempted of women but he didn't yield to it okay that's right he had a right to be married he was a man he had a right to good clothes he was a man but he Sanctified himself he forfeited it he he could have he could have come down the corridors of Glory a full statured man with an Angelic band sure but he Sanctified himself he could have at least been born in a nice clean bed somewhere but he was born in a manger over a man Pile in a bar manger but he Sanctified himself why he was the lamb see friends we got to to back we got to back to a assembly assembly line religions and so forth that's where we got to right and all of these things that we're getting away from the real things humble yourself keep humble Lord sanctify me look the last one taken from and thy seed shall possess the Gate of the enemies preached in 1961 to 12 the evening service paragraph e51 he possess every gate of Temptation oh how he did he was a man he was a man like you are like I am he had a right to be married he had a right to have a home he had a right to the things that we have he had right to have clothes he could have done it a man that could turn water into wine that could know where a coin was in a fish's mouth while he owned the heavens and earth but yet he abstained from those things the sweetest words in the Bible when he when he said father I sanctify myself that I might sanctify them him what was he trying to do set an example he was sending 12 men out with a gospel that would conquer the world and he's depending on you and and I to do it if he could sanctify himself like that why ought we why ought we to set aside every failure and every doubt and everything else and sanctify ourselves for We Are The Seed of Abraham through him that are more than conquerors through him yes he had a right to be married he had a right to have a home he had a right to lay his head on a pillow but the foxes have BS and the birds have nest and the son of man don't have a place to lay his head why I sanctify myself father for their sake I do it for their sake not because he had to but for their sake he conquered every enemy that's for you and I he set himself aside see ought it to be that we are to be set herself aside to be a unit for God you know to be set aside to the bases that we we wouldn't uh wind up in the wrong way all right pull up number 11 I just want you to of scripture this may not what you would say this is applied to the what we're talking about but let's see if it does look look number 11 brother Isaiah 56 and 3 Let's see what God thinks of Unix not talking of ster or not Unix neither let the son of the stranger that have joined himself to the Lord Isa F 56 3-5 speak saying the Lord ha utterly separated me from his people neither let the unic say behold I am a dry tree right don't let him say it for thus sayith the Lord unto the Unix that keep my sabbaths in other words that follow the word do what the word says right and choose the things that please me and take hold of my Covenant there's the kind I want to be right even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place he's going to give it right right beside the bride everywhere she goes they're going to go right I didn't read all of the them in between what we got but you already to know it even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and daughters he's not talking about Sons and Daughters of God like we talk of sons and daughters because we know that they're not greater but are greater than Sons and Daughters or you know your sons and your daughters I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off that's right no wonder they can sing a new song you want these other quotes about being the Unix Servants of the Bride you can have them brother BR says that they they're Temple guards that's amen they escort the bride wherever she goes what about it amen you won't be ARG get fussing over who's a servant and who's a not it will be a joyous opportunity we were able to go up one time to the uh tomb of unknown soldier how many of you probably been there if you notice how they guard that tomb constantly 24 hours I reckon a day I know they do during the daytime they guard that tomb and we were able to see The Changing of the Guard how many's Ever Seen The Changing of the Guard actually when they changed him it's really something that guy come out and he's walked out and escorted out by someone and they got a man there but and he looks him over he checks him from one end to the other when everything got to be to a te he takes a gun he looks it over to make sure it's clean he does all kind of things but he's checking him over he won't let him go up there I read about it that they can only have a 30in waist they've got to set themselves aside they can only have a 30in waist and they looked it a special group of people set to dis guard and they had certain things certain ways certain things and then they had to March and they had to guard that to of the Unknown Soldier but I thought about how much man could put into doing something you know to be an honor right an honor guard you have honor guards that goes with the president you know he goes anywhere you have honor guards with a governor you go you have all kind of Honor guards and when someone passes away they come out you know and they do all of their things they're honor God specially Le people but what about 144,000 they're going to be keepers of the bridal chamber right they're going to guard her amen and they would give their lives for her you're not going to get there but we know it won't have to be gardened like guarding then but it just be honor guards right amen but they'll be with the bride amen not as servants to Pisces biscuits right but to make sure the biscuits that comes in is all right you know that there's people set outside I read this one time with the president you know that he they can't bring him a meal unless it goes to certain people you ever know read that they can't just set him down and give him a meal why cuz somebody could poison him that's right so it has to go through certain channels it has to be certain doings those are the honor guards but want it be something to be there and not look down on them as servants cuz remember they give eternal life here amen that's right but to see them there and realize who they are Y and be able to sit down and talk to them and be able to listen to them at night singing their songs but R said in the seal book it's only seven seal I think he said those two witnesses will tell Israel said you rejected the right of sunship Y and the Gentiles has come in and accepted that right well you know they don't scream and cry and wail because of the fact that they missed it an opportunity to be they scream and cry because they crucified their Master a lot of difference in it amen they can sing a new song even a song that you and I can't sing right but you know what they can't sing ours they can't sing ours special singing but especially Elite people that will be in the millennial reign with the BR of Jesus Christ amen you see what I'm talking about Unix these are not physical Unix they are people who set aside themselves not to receive any of the doctrines it says right amen that's it they receive none of the doctrines of the old mother even though their nation is in a covenant with the Antichrist they will give their lives right right right for the gospel what about you and I come on this what about you and I are we set aside enough that we give our life for this gospel what about it well brother Dale are you a Dooms Day preacher you think we're going through a lot no there's a lot the prophet said about it look like we're going to go through right up to God I just want to be ready I just want to be ready to whatever comes yeah but you see we get our own selves in trouble I remember years ago I preached a message back probably 40 years ago called it persecution CU I've never had believed since I heard the prophet's message the bride is going through the tribulation no right but he says there'll be great persecution comeing upon this end time people that send the bride even physically be uh lose all there many things talking and he says the bride but you know what an opportunity is to be the bride right and for him to choose to let you and I go through these things for our Perfection amen right to bring us to a place remember is guided back to the Homeland 6 million killed but that was God's tender nail scarred hand leading them back to the promised land we just don't see God's way of doing that right let's stand we just don't see it the way that he sees it right 169 spir 169 in this spir book anybody have an e oh my heart SS today of joy and gladness Jus SA have wonderful bu of problems with never let's just s let's believe that when you get there everything be all right is that hard to believe if it is why ask you well you shouldn't ask and put a time right what he said me ask believe it father we send this prayer call for sister pre there Lord we know she's sick today probably you she'll see hear what we say thank youus anybody else day by day all the way and sweet what in myly station my out of God's going to give us all kind of things be wonderful where he go we go that 144,000 going to be right there with us that's right God thanks of them if you keep the Sabbath as we read in Isaiah you keep the sa you keep the Covenant you follow the word then you're not going to be a dry tree in him what from all and shame just sing that to one another counsel might God is me keeping me from all sin and shame wonderful is PR and my name is the heaven wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me God me wonderful living with my Lord and a holy my all the way oh I change in my L station my soul has s for salvation wonderful
