[2:23] get some get some refueling if you got
[2:26] your Bibles let's turn now while we're
[2:27] standing to the Book of Revelations
[2:30] chapter 10 tonight we're going to begin
[2:34] our study on the seals but we're going
[2:37] to not get to them for a while we're
[2:40] going to make a foundation we've been
[2:43] talking on it downstairs and I believe
[2:45] the Lord showed us something a couple
[2:48] weeks ago that may help us all because
[2:51] there's many schools of thoughts the
[2:52] seals open or the closed door they dance
[2:54] or they made the seven thunders the
[2:58] voice of seven men they've made the
[3:00] seven thunders polygamy they made the
[3:02] seven thunders this but remember it's
[3:05] got to compare with every scripture in
[3:07] the Bible it's got to compare with every
[3:09] scripture in the Bible can't be
[3:11] something extra written I was reading
[3:13] the quote just a few minutes ago where
[3:14] they told brother Branham boy brother
[3:16] branham you know you could rock that
[3:18] 23rd chapter revelations with the
[3:20] revelation you have you know and he said
[3:22] good he said but you can't add one word
[3:25] or you can't take one word away he said
[3:28] they were trying to trap me it wasn't
[3:30] them it was Satan inside of him trying
[3:33] wasn't a man trying to do it it was a it
[3:35] was the devil inside of them so we still
[3:40] believe in Devils right yeah we brought
[3:42] a couple with us today so we're gonna
[3:44] try to get rid of them trying to kill
[3:45] them all
[3:45] so in these seven seals we're going to
[3:48] tonight we're going to look at a
[3:50] foundation so we'll start with the
[3:52] foundation of the seven seals and we'll
[3:55] read it from revelations 10 and I want
[3:58] to like I said I want to stay on it for
[4:01] a little while
[4:02] I really enjoyed what brother William
[4:04] brought Sunday and I really enjoyed
[4:07] because we're going to get into it in
[4:09] just a minute we're in Daniel he said
[4:11] that you know that I was thinking when
[4:13] he was preaching when he preached on
[4:15] that comma that was 2000 years that
[4:20] comma income past 2,000 years that's the
[4:23] eternal Word of God every period
[4:25] encompasses a certain amount of time
[4:27] they ever come they ever whatever you
[4:29] want to call it in compassed same thing
[4:31] with Daniel Daniel was told to shut up
[4:32] the book 2600 years ago right and the
[4:36] Bible says the wise shall understand and
[4:38] that's today so you got a 2,600 year gap
[4:42] in just a few little words so thank God
[4:44] for the eternal Word of God thank God
[4:46] for the fivefold ministry hey man cuz we
[4:49] would not know these things and like I
[4:50] said we're gonna if you think that the
[4:53] seals are closed and yeah they are if
[4:58] you think they are they are if you think
[5:01] they're open they're open hey man good
[5:04] enough for me cuz if if you don't
[5:07] believe then you become an unbeliever
[5:08] and unbelievers cannot see the Seventh
[5:12] Seal it's not to the unbeliever all
[5:15] right it's only to a special group of
[5:17] people and I think we have been
[5:20] fortunate highly blessed and favoured to
[5:23] to have it being preached to us from the
[5:26] long time ago to now so thank God for
[5:28] that and and Christine is about to get
[5:31] finished with the book and when she does
[5:33] I'm gonna proofread a little bit and
[5:34] then we'll have all of brother Dale 60
[5:36] sermons on paper so we'll be able to
[5:40] study it and read it just like just like
[5:42] we do I'm not trying to add to nothing
[5:44] to take away but I promise you one thing
[5:46] it'll bless your soul won't bless your
[5:49] heart it bless your soul amen
[5:51] and it's a good foundation to from
[5:53] whence everything comes from that's why
[5:55] I wanted to talk about tonight is
[5:58] basically the foundation that we're
[6:00] looking at because like I said before
[6:01] people in the message you know they
[6:03] think well brother Brant preached the
[6:04] seals and that's it well why are we
[6:05] still here 54 years after the Prophet
[6:09] now listen up don't get me wrong
[6:11] supposedly opened up the Seventh Seal if
[6:13] they're open that was the mystery of
[6:16] redemption that was a remember ba de
[6:19] change that was the rapture that was the
[6:22] capstone coming down 54 years we little
[6:26] slow but you know what gotten you this
[6:30] that's why I told brother Branham to
[6:32] tell the people on that and you heard it
[6:34] on the questions and answers he said
[6:36] it's not even for you it's not even for
[6:39] that group of people and I'll read here
[6:40] also where brother Branham we like to
[6:43] read the quote about the two things that
[6:45] the Matthew ky4 person is supposed to do
[6:47] but we don't read the next chapter we're
[6:51] gonna read the next we're gonna read the
[6:53] next not chapter but your next few
[6:55] sentences we're brother and says only
[6:56] for a certain group of people
[6:58] so let's revelations 10 verse 1 you pray
[7:02] because I have been you pray that the
[7:07] Lord will will give us something we
[7:11] talked about a little bit downstairs and
[7:13] we're still we're on the sixth seal
[7:14] downstairs but I told them we'd try to
[7:15] start doing it again up here but we'll
[7:18] do it maybe a little bit slower so let's
[7:20] bow our heads and and give honor to the
[7:22] Lord
[7:22] dear Jesus we pray today Lord that you
[7:26] will absolutely be the one that speaks
[7:28] your here the same as you were the night
[7:31] that the Prophet broke those seals you
[7:34] have not changed
[7:35] we are not prophets but we are prophetic
[7:37] people we are people who the words come
[7:40] to we are the people that have the
[7:43] listening ears are the receptor to be
[7:46] able to receive revelation to receive
[7:50] supernatural revelation that comes
[7:53] straight from you Satan cannot touch
[7:55] this he is not in this he has nothing to
[7:59] do he can only beat our flesh he can
[8:02] only try to turn us against things but
[8:04] Father in the name of Jesus Christ we
[8:06] rebuked that devil that he'll try to do
[8:09] anything now but we pray that in the
[8:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that that
[8:14] will not happen that we'll be able to
[8:16] flow through this and Lord everything
[8:19] will be done for your honor and glory we
[8:21] pray that you would heal the sick save
[8:24] the Lost
[8:25] give those brothers in the foreign
[8:28] fields give them fruit for their labor
[8:29] Lord probably give us today our daily
[8:31] bread and Jesus name we pray amen
[8:34] revelations 10 verse 1 and I saw another
[8:39] mighty angel come down from heaven now
[8:41] as I'm reading this I'm not gonna do so
[8:43] much backgrounding on this one scripture
[8:46] because you should know that when I said
[8:48] mighty angel what are you gonna think
[8:51] when I say mighty angel you're gonna say
[8:54] Christ okay all right and I thought this
[8:58] is a teaching this I told him I'm not
[9:00] gonna move around a lot tonight and I
[9:02] saw another mighty angel brother branham
[9:03] said only Christ it could be all right
[9:05] so that's Christ coming down from heaven
[9:09] clothed with a cloud would go back to
[9:11] revelations 1 and find all these
[9:13] characteristics of this mighty angel
[9:15] because look how it's hidden in the
[9:16] Bible it's a lowercase a the angel of
[9:21] the Covenant was always a little capital
[9:23] hey but that God hid that he hid that
[9:26] from the wise and prudent only a prophet
[9:29] could say well that says another mighty
[9:31] angel that could just be anybody know
[9:33] read the characteristics write the
[9:36] characteristics tells you exactly who
[9:37] that is which is Christ
[9:39] all right rainbow upon his head in his
[9:41] face was that where the Sun and his feet
[9:43] as pillars of fire and he had in his
[9:45] hand a little book open and he said his
[9:48] right foot upon the sea and his left
[9:50] foot upon the earth and cried with a
[9:51] loud voice as when a lion roars and when
[9:54] he had cried seven thunders uttered
[9:56] their voices now watch this right here
[9:59] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[10:00] their voices I was about to write a joy
[10:04] I was about to write something he was
[10:06] not hesitant to write it in other words
[10:10] it wasn't a mystery to him he saw what
[10:13] he saw him was getting ready to write it
[10:14] down in other words it wasn't so
[10:16] mysterious that he said walk I can't
[10:18] write that no he was getting ready to
[10:20] write it down so it must be something
[10:23] real simple where everybody's made of
[10:25] something so mysterious alright and when
[10:29] the seven thunders had other the voices
[10:31] I was about to write and I heard a voice
[10:33] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[10:36] things all right now the seven seals
[10:39] have been open but here says seal up
[10:41] those things which the seven thunders
[10:44] uttered got it and write them not all
[10:49] right and the angel which I saw stand
[10:51] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[10:53] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[10:55] that liveth for ever and ever who
[10:56] created heaven and the things that
[10:58] therein and the earth and the things
[10:59] that therein and the sea and the things
[11:01] that are therein that there should be
[11:03] time no longer but in the days of the
[11:05] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[11:08] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[11:13] be finished and I we don't we're going
[11:15] to dwell on this so you can go and be
[11:16] seated as he hath declared to his
[11:19] servants the prophets
[11:21] not one remember every prophet every
[11:25] prophet look back to the previous
[11:27] prophet to see what they say it a man so
[11:32] this seventh angel messenger has got to
[11:35] look back all the way from Moses all the
[11:38] way down to John standing there right
[11:41] now and he had to compare every
[11:43] scripture that's what the Bible says as
[11:45] he hath declared to his servants the
[11:49] prophets plural and then they built on
[11:53] each other remember the the Old
[11:55] Testament prophets built the body of
[11:57] Jesus Christ
[11:57] we're built on the foundation of what
[11:59] the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ
[12:01] being the chief Cornerstone amen
[12:03] so I had to compare with every prophet
[12:07] so that's great whatever this great
[12:09] mystery is mystery of God that should be
[12:12] finished had to be declared by
[12:15] every prophet every prophet had their
[12:21] revelation mystery Moses was not to
[12:26] build an ark Noah's was to build an ark
[12:29] Moses was to deliver a group of people
[12:32] Jeremiah was to write down that 70 years
[12:36] you're going to be in captivity and all
[12:38] these other things and he was the one
[12:40] that wrote it and then Daniel was what
[12:42] brother Brown said Daniel look back and
[12:44] read what Jeremiah said knew that it was
[12:47] going to be 70 years he was in the 68th
[12:50] year and he was getting ready to come
[12:51] out so he must have believed what the
[12:53] Prophet said now what did Paul do Paul
[12:55] comes in the New Testament and he
[12:57] doesn't he has no he has no writings of
[13:00] Jesus he has no Matthew Mark Luke and
[13:05] John he only has the Old Testament
[13:08] Scrolls which is what the Old Testament
[13:11] prophets he takes to Revelation from
[13:14] that and writes the New Testament and
[13:17] then so we have to look at the prophets
[13:20] previous and the prophets prior bring
[13:22] them all together that the one mystery
[13:25] of God should be finished now let me ask
[13:27] you a question what do all prophets have
[13:30] in common
[13:35] there's one thing that the whole Bible
[13:39] has in common Redemption Redemption all
[13:47] of them sure now remember when a prophet
[13:49] hits the earth what does he do he
[13:52] declares a war on what the people that
[13:54] turn him down but he brings grace to the
[13:57] ones that accept it
[13:58] and then he brings grace to a group of
[14:01] people he brings judgment to a group of
[14:03] people Jeremiah Ezekiel all the ones are
[14:06] saying Israel if you'll do this if
[14:08] you'll do this but if you don't do this
[14:10] this is what's going to happen all right
[14:12] so we take the things that the prophets
[14:15] said prior and we look at them and we
[14:17] use them because it all is in either
[14:20] redemption of us or Israel the only two
[14:24] groups of people in the Bible Gentiles
[14:27] Gentiles and Jews
[14:29] all right Gentiles this nation's Jews is
[14:32] we know who that is in the Old Testament
[14:34] and moving up into the New Testament and
[14:36] so those are only two people so the so
[14:39] the prophets what they either declare
[14:41] warning judgment or they declare what
[14:45] like Elijah I told you when I was
[14:46] preaching up the five comings of Elijah
[14:50] Elijah was judgment to Jezebel but he
[14:54] was a savior to the little widow woman
[14:57] and man she accepted his message and
[15:00] Jezebel turned it down well what look
[15:03] what she got and look what the widow
[15:04] woman God same way with you and I we
[15:06] come to the end time to this message of
[15:08] the hour and if you totally turn this
[15:10] message down knowing what we know now I
[15:13] don't know it's just gonna be rough and
[15:16] then because what it's the great it's
[15:18] the greatest buts the most simple it's
[15:22] gotta be simple God in simplicity is the
[15:27] first thing that the Prophet to God
[15:28] preached all right so now let's look at
[15:30] something here real quick Ephesians 4
[15:32] verse 29 through 32 let no corrupt
[15:34] communication proceed out of your mouth
[15:36] but that which is good to the use of
[15:38] edifying that it may Minister grace unto
[15:41] the hearer and grieve not the Holy
[15:43] Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto
[15:45] the day of redemption
[15:48] all right you're sealed unto the day of
[15:51] your redemption all right and remember
[15:53] when you're sealed you're sealed with
[15:55] what that Holy Spirit of promise so
[15:58] there's only really one seal and that's
[16:00] the whole ego amen but we're going to
[16:02] talk about though but you say that and
[16:04] now you've got a you've got to put all
[16:05] the revelations and all the what the
[16:07] prophets say you've got to put every bit
[16:08] of that in there amen alright because
[16:11] what it is what is the Holy Ghost that's
[16:14] your Redemption that's your Redemption
[16:17] God redeems you by giving you the Holy
[16:20] Ghost and then but he's not finished
[16:22] with that remember being born again
[16:29] being born again right by the
[16:33] incorruptible Word of God Paul says I
[16:36] died daily you're sealed until the day
[16:40] of your Redemption let all bitterness
[16:42] and wrath I like to
[16:43] read the rest of in wrath and anger and
[16:45] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[16:48] from you with all malice and be you kind
[16:51] one to another tender-hearted forgiving
[16:53] one another even as God for Christ's
[16:55] sake hath forgiven you
[16:56] amen now I want to ask you a couple of
[17:00] things before we get stuff well let's go
[17:01] and read first quote now this is all
[17:04] familiar to us but I'm gonna keep
[17:07] reading it because brother Branham he
[17:09] emphasizes this in the Laodicean Church
[17:11] days so now this messenger amount come
[17:13] forward but now remember we stop right
[17:15] here we quote it to here but watch I
[17:22] want to sell on the show don't roll it
[17:23] down here but I want you to show you
[17:24] what he said right into that quote now
[17:27] this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[17:29] Revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[17:32] things one according to Malachi four and
[17:35] he would turn the hearts of the children
[17:36] to the father's now he's going to what
[17:39] turn the hearts of the babbling
[17:43] Pentecostal babies back to the
[17:46] Pentecostal fathers of the original Amen
[17:51] that's the son of God revelation that's
[17:54] what God built the church on told John I
[17:57] mean told Peter upon this rock I'll
[18:00] build my church a revelation of those
[18:03] founding fathers and I was telling them
[18:05] back there in the back of minute ago
[18:06] that brother Dale is exactly correct
[18:08] when when he makes the quote that
[18:11] brother Brown said they were closer to
[18:13] the rapture in the first age why because
[18:15] they didn't have any denomination they
[18:18] didn't have any false doctrine but they
[18:20] were beginning to have a little bit of
[18:22] false dr. Amen you've fallen away from
[18:24] your first love okay that alright say
[18:26] man so according to Malachi 4 he will
[18:29] turn the hearts of the children now from
[18:31] 47 to 63 that's just giving you a time
[18:33] element because remember we had fallen
[18:36] away from the one God and the water
[18:38] baptism and all the things that we see I
[18:40] mean thank God thank God listen there's
[18:44] one thing I thank God for is that he
[18:46] sent a prophet to tell me that if I get
[18:49] born again and have the baptism of Holy
[18:51] Ghost in my soul I do not have to stand
[18:53] judgment
[18:55] every denomination will tell you you're
[18:58] gonna stand before that judgment bar one
[19:00] day I know we're gonna be judged for
[19:05] deeds in the body for the good or bad
[19:06] okay but that has nothing to do with my
[19:09] eternal destination my eternal
[19:12] destination is here but thank God that a
[19:14] prophet come to tell us that amen
[19:20] well you know what it was in the Bible
[19:22] and the first church age they had it
[19:25] right it's just that man had eroded the
[19:28] revelation coming down - now - you know
[19:32] I still in somebody the other day we and
[19:35] it's okay and you think well you you're
[19:37] being too but you know it's done say old
[19:39] you know John died and he's walking on
[19:41] the streets to go talking to Jesus well
[19:43] we know he's not we know he's not that's
[19:46] not that's not true but that's what mama
[19:50] told us that's what granny told us right
[19:53] but it's not true it's false if they're
[19:57] born again they're sitting in the sixth
[19:59] dimension waiting on me and you are
[20:01] there in the fifth dimension waiting on
[20:05] something else right and they're not
[20:08] burning in hell boy he went to hell
[20:10] today he's burned it no he's not burn in
[20:13] hell yet but thank God that we've had a
[20:16] prophet come and tell us all these
[20:17] things lined it right up and just so
[20:19] beautiful well see remember that was the
[20:23] that was the faith of the fathers that
[20:26] was written all through the Bible man
[20:30] has the one that took it and made
[20:31] denomination man has took it and made it
[20:34] three gods and made it Trinitarian I
[20:37] mean water baptism father son Holy Ghost
[20:39] like we were coming out the other day
[20:40] man did that the Bible never changed so
[20:47] so the first thing of the Malachi for
[20:50] man we know who it was the spirit of
[20:52] Elijah was to turn everybody back and
[20:55] get us lined up amen brother Brown did
[21:00] not come I know some people had a
[21:02] problem with that this weekend and I
[21:03] really don't care
[21:04] brother Brown didn't come to tell us how
[21:06] to pray how to how to dress
[21:08] how to act right my granny acted right
[21:13] and she didn't know who the brother
[21:14] branham was that was in the Bible how
[21:18] not to cut your hair and wear pants and
[21:20] how that's not the custom be in the
[21:22] barroom
[21:22] that's what the Bible said man has took
[21:25] and what put a sheet over it basically
[21:28] shut the Bible back up so the Prophet
[21:33] didn't bring us a new revelation he
[21:36] brought us clarity I like that word he
[21:38] brought us clarity because you know we
[21:40] bought dad the church did several years
[21:42] ago we bought him a pair but not clear
[21:43] it was like a thousand dollars and man
[21:46] you could see a gnat scratches nose you
[21:48] know off of a deer 200 yards away but do
[21:51] you know what if you don't focus those
[21:53] binoculars if those binoculars are a
[21:56] little bit off you can't see from here
[21:57] to sister Jeanne I don't care how much
[22:00] it cost so if you don't get to focus
[22:02] right if you don't get it we're both
[22:05] glasses are seeing one that's why the
[22:07] Bible says you're I be hot single amen
[22:11] not your ib3 her - and the message is -
[22:16] now to Lourdes and all that other stuff
[22:19] but anyway we're not here to talk about
[22:21] false doctrine alright but remember
[22:24] that's what the first part of brother
[22:26] Brown now remember he there was no
[22:28] cutoff point everybody says well 47 to
[22:31] 63 there's no cut out point but really
[22:33] during that time brother Branham was
[22:35] doing he was doing an act of restoration
[22:37] he was turning us back to the faith that
[22:40] was originally in this church age right
[22:43] here actually the first three ages were
[22:46] basically one God water baptism was
[22:49] right and all the things and then man
[22:51] got into it but there's a second part
[22:55] that he has to do that is related
[22:58] singularly to you and I tonight write us
[23:04] so you can say he's talking to me hey
[23:08] man he's talking to me - he will reveal
[23:13] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[23:15] Revelations 10 now watch what he says
[23:18] which are the revelations contained
[23:21] in there seven seals now we're going to
[23:24] talk about that in a minute something
[23:25] come to me the other day a knife if it
[23:27] ain't right then we got a man sitting
[23:28] here tell me different it will be these
[23:31] devour Julie's it will be ceased to
[23:33] finally revealed mystery truths that
[23:36] literally now priests on that's a while
[23:40] back that word literally is not a type
[23:44] literally means the person it literally
[23:48] turns you back to the faith of the
[23:51] Pentecostal fathers exactly so but now
[23:54] watch look who's it for growth it but
[24:00] consider this also this prophet
[24:02] messenger will be in his nature and
[24:04] manners as were elijah and join the
[24:07] people of that know yes you and i of
[24:10] this prophet messengers day will be as
[24:14] they were in Ahab's day and in John's
[24:16] and since it is only the children whose
[24:20] hearts will be turned it is only the
[24:23] children who will listen hey man it's
[24:28] only the children I was watching
[24:33] Saturday his brother William was
[24:35] preaching there was some shuck being
[24:38] shook now listen there's nothing wrong
[24:42] with the show the shuck has a part but
[24:45] the shuck pulls away and the real seed
[24:49] shows forth hey man when you start
[24:52] telling people like brother William did
[24:53] that that I guess they figured that that
[24:57] William was talking they're probably
[24:58] gonna figure I'm talking about something
[25:00] that brother Branham didn't bring that
[25:02] that we're going to bring something he
[25:04] didn't have that's totally fault you got
[25:07] that right no they're just blind by that
[25:09] old Pentecostal age that they lived in
[25:14] that look holiness brother Branham was a
[25:19] prophet and we're going into rapture
[25:22] there's nothing wrong with that but you
[25:27] won't take a body change with that you
[25:29] won't take a headstone revelation with
[25:32] that no no you'll go down to the gray
[25:34] and you come up but the whole show they
[25:37] start shaking their head you know those
[25:39] shop starts do that's why it's kosher
[25:41] they shook their self but only the
[25:46] children who will listen right Amen now
[25:52] let's go they read and Daniel like I
[25:57] said I'm gonna take my time but I'm not
[25:58] gonna take a lot of time so Daniel 12:9
[26:02] says and and he said go thy way Daniel
[26:05] for the words are closed up and sealed
[26:08] till the time of the end now when is
[26:11] that now that's what I said watch this
[26:14] right here many shall be purified and
[26:16] made white and tried but the wicked
[26:21] shall do wickedly and none of the wicked
[26:24] shall understand but the wise shall
[26:27] understand now that one scripture in
[26:30] Compass's 2600 years
[26:33] Daniel was written in about BC 538 verse
[26:38] 2020s about almost 2600 years that that
[26:41] scripture had told Daniel to shut it up
[26:44] don't write anything down now remember
[26:47] we're gonna look brother Brown said he
[26:48] heard the thunders
[26:51] Daniel heard the funders amen but he was
[26:54] free bidden to ride here she's seated up
[26:56] why listen
[26:58] God's not gonna do anything unless
[27:00] there's somebody there to understand
[27:02] what he's saying that's like with the
[27:05] Prophet with brother Branham saying
[27:06] you're not getting it it's not for you
[27:08] live a good simple Christian life go on
[27:13] with the same simple message amen and I
[27:17] hope that's what we're continuing to do
[27:18] now amen
[27:20] but it's given to us it's given to us to
[27:23] understand other things
[27:25] I'll read it Sunday the Bible says the
[27:27] deep things of God brother Branham said
[27:30] supernatural things it's what we're
[27:33] supposed to understand
[27:34] amen that's why your eyes looked in that
[27:38] Bible and you read every denominational
[27:40] idea you had right unless you were a
[27:45] Mormon or somebody else that had a
[27:46] different Bible
[27:47] but if you had the same Bible you were
[27:49] looking in that Bible sample there's a
[27:50] Trinity well there's a water baptism
[27:53] father son alright but now what happened
[27:55] did the Bible chain know the one that
[27:59] motivated you changed you changed
[28:03] because what's inside changed and you
[28:06] began to read it what with those
[28:07] binoculars with the focus where you
[28:10] could focus into one so let's try to not
[28:13] be so you know I don't want to we don't
[28:16] want to sound so mysterious because it's
[28:19] really not we come to this part of the
[28:21] endtime it should be more plain I told I
[28:24] told the luison em the other day we were
[28:27] talking about being simple we're talking
[28:29] about simple do you know that there's I
[28:32] think there's 15,000 don't look it up
[28:35] somebody want to google it later how
[28:39] many words there are in the English
[28:40] language
[28:41] there's five hundreds of thousands right
[28:44] it only comes from 26 letters any number
[28:51] that you come up with 64 is a entry and
[28:54] being being being being being comes from
[28:56] 10 let 10 numbers 0 to 9 how simple can
[29:01] you get you've only got 10 numbers and
[29:04] 26 letters in an alphabet that's why I
[29:07] heard the other day when somebody was
[29:09] saying that you know I Pam's brother
[29:11] Dale said you know the guy comes by and
[29:13] heard the blue boy saying his ABC he
[29:16] said I say my ABCs and said God will
[29:18] filter you know he'll put off well
[29:19] that's the truth everything you want to
[29:21] say to God was from A to Z God put it
[29:25] all together so that's what we're trying
[29:27] to do here don't think that this is so
[29:28] mysterious that we can't understand it
[29:30] but I want us to see one thing tonight
[29:32] if we don't see anything else and I'm
[29:35] short in just a minute but now let's
[29:37] read number 2 now this is 1953 a message
[29:40] called faith now watch this is 1953
[29:43] listen God bless you I want to tell you
[29:46] just one thing I know I'm holding long
[29:47] but I just want this one little thing I
[29:49] know and I want you to remember there's
[29:52] something fixing to happen remember I
[29:54] told you that now this is 10 years
[29:57] before the seals is open right okay
[30:01] there's a step up coming in the church
[30:04] now see these things that you're now
[30:07] seeing are going to be just little
[30:09] things after a while progression in
[30:14] Revelation amen something's moving and I
[30:20] say this by the power of the revelation
[30:22] of Jesus Christ nobody when the Prophet
[30:24] says that my ears pop up all right Who
[30:28] am I everyone in our doctrine in our
[30:31] baptism we've come to a place but
[30:34] there's some key that will unlock
[30:35] something here now he saw the book
[30:39] sealed on seven seals and when the
[30:43] Daniel saw the same and when the
[30:45] thunders uttered their voices he said
[30:47] don't write what that was in the
[30:50] scripture but it be revealed in the last
[30:53] day we're at the time we're at kadish
[30:56] right now amen
[30:59] and I want to kind of interject a little
[31:00] something in here I know a lot of you
[31:02] how many of you heard that the
[31:03] denominational world says the rapture is
[31:05] gonna take place on September the 23rd
[31:08] there's big articles about it what's
[31:10] happened is Virgo is in line with Leo
[31:13] and there's 12 stars over the Virgin's
[31:15] head now listen if it's telling them
[31:17] backs their backs back there now if I
[31:19] was the denominational person I'd be
[31:22] worried because they did line up the way
[31:23] they're supposed to never had before all
[31:26] right they've lined up and they've lined
[31:28] up under the first day of the Feast of
[31:30] Trumpets in Israel so buddy that but
[31:33] look just like brother Ram said
[31:34] something's happening but it's not
[31:37] happening to just the Stars it's
[31:41] happening to you and I first it's got to
[31:45] happen to you and I first there's
[31:46] something stepping up coming into church
[31:49] now
[31:49] some things are moving the reason it's
[31:52] moving because I'm gonna tell you
[31:53] something September 23rd we will not
[31:54] have a rapture that's a the Lord goes no
[32:04] man knows the day are the hour we might
[32:09] know the week of the box but not the day
[32:12] nor the hour
[32:14] the denominational world listen without
[32:16] a prophet to tell us what that virgin
[32:18] was with the Sun or the moon over ahead
[32:21] and the Stars and all that brother
[32:23] Branham explained all that so see to me
[32:25] what it does it settles me these
[32:28] revelations did I receive and you
[32:30] receive should settle you the problem is
[32:33] is we have too many questions and
[32:35] questions are unsettling amen that's the
[32:40] reason the dark is real hard to get over
[32:43] the fear of darkness why coach can't see
[32:46] but the same thing in the daylight you
[32:50] can stand and look at the same thing in
[32:52] a daylight and not be scared but in the
[32:55] dark you see shadows you see stuff
[32:57] moving you ought to go deer hunting
[32:59] sometime and get there before dark
[33:01] I mean before daylight trees start
[33:05] walking through the wood and Momma
[33:10] shoots them I promise you you in her
[33:15] defense you can look at something long
[33:16] enough and it'll move I saw it dearie
[33:19] the other day at brother Donnie's I was
[33:21] delivering mail and right down below his
[33:23] house and we see deer there all the time
[33:24] and right down below his house and this
[33:26] this where the wind had blow it
[33:28] everything off they was just and it
[33:30] looked just like a deer laying on the
[33:31] side of the road till I got close to it
[33:34] it was a limb with a bunch of leaves on
[33:37] it okay that's what I'm telling you
[33:39] about this we're looking right at
[33:41] something but the Prophet gave us so
[33:44] much clarity all the prophets they gave
[33:46] us so much clarity that we can actually
[33:48] see that and say that's not a deer are
[33:51] that's a false teaching or that's not
[33:53] there so this is not lined up
[33:55] it's like William said this weekend he
[33:56] said and I told him excuse me told him
[34:00] the other day you can have a beautiful
[34:02] picture the cow the grass and the tree
[34:04] but if the cows in the top of the tree
[34:07] that picture is worthless right except
[34:11] if you're a Picasso maybe you know where
[34:14] you got a eyeball over here and anyway
[34:16] it's trying to be funny but anyway um
[34:17] thank you Julie but when you got the cow
[34:22] but you've got all your players though
[34:23] you've got the cow you've got grass for
[34:26] it to eat and a tree for it to stand
[34:28] under
[34:28] but if you got the caliph in the tree
[34:30] it's totally wrong so that's our problem
[34:34] we've had it where now we're trying now
[34:35] we're getting the picture right I
[34:37] believe we're getting that picture down
[34:39] to what we see clarity to where we can
[34:41] when we come in and open our Bible or
[34:44] when we read the prophets message we
[34:46] don't have that many question at least I
[34:50] don't and I'm hoping that we can convey
[34:52] it to you that you don't because it does
[34:54] me no good to just that I understand it
[34:57] I want you to understand that amen I
[35:00] always pray before I leave this any
[35:03] office I look raise my hand and say
[35:05] Garden
[35:06] do whatever you want to with me during
[35:08] this service but may the people see you
[35:11] may the people understand you and not me
[35:15] and don't worry about me I've stood with
[35:17] headaches and all kind of stuff but and
[35:19] the devil you know what the devil will
[35:22] play with your brain I don't care if
[35:23] you're still preaching hey all the
[35:27] preachers say man hey man
[35:29] that's right you be praying for somebody
[35:31] enough fall to come in your mind just as
[35:33] horrible as it can be why because you
[35:35] live in those those two lives are still
[35:37] there the devil can still enter your
[35:39] brain we're human I mean that's just the
[35:45] way it is - anyway this September 23rd
[35:49] thing don't worry about it there's a
[35:51] step up coming in the church now why
[35:53] because the people are getting ready the
[35:56] people are seeing something amen
[35:59] I at least I am but I want you to that's
[36:03] why I want to go into this and and try
[36:05] to lay the foundation because I was
[36:07] listening to them people talking about
[36:09] the the hurricanes over in the Puerto
[36:12] Rico in places where they have to drill
[36:14] down so many hundreds of feet before
[36:15] they hit torille because if you don't
[36:18] hey if you build a 50-story building or
[36:21] a hundred storey building and that thing
[36:23] sinks this far
[36:25] the whole building topple over they got
[36:27] to get down to a solid foundation and
[36:30] then you start building your building we
[36:33] all know that building anything you got
[36:35] to have a solid foundation so maybe we
[36:37] have a I hope we have a solid foundation
[36:39] man number three let's go to it this is
[36:46] the ephesian church age 1960 1205 as
[36:48] Daniel heard the seven thunders and
[36:51] forbidden so now let me let me stop here
[36:54] Daniel heard the seven thunders I'm not
[36:56] worried about the hearing or the seeing
[36:58] Daniel got something come to him the
[37:01] same thing come to John and it didn't
[37:03] scare him are you getting my point John
[37:07] didn't get scared to see it Daniel
[37:10] getting it so it must be something they
[37:12] were familiar with because the the the
[37:18] Lord had to step on the scene in both
[37:20] instances and tell him to seal it up
[37:23] must have been important but it wasn't
[37:27] for that group of people it was for this
[37:30] group of people as Daniel heard the
[37:34] seven thunders and forbidden and John
[37:36] heard the voices and this book was
[37:38] sealed listen now what explain something
[37:40] to you real quick I was over in the
[37:43] Philippines a couple years ago and
[37:45] hopefully we're going back but they have
[37:47] a doctrine of 14 seals
[37:49] now if you're reading revelations 5 you
[37:52] read it says on well we can read it but
[37:55] we won't read it we're going to read
[37:56] next Sunday anyway they have a base 14
[38:00] seals which is seven that brother
[38:01] branham free and then obviously it's
[38:04] gonna be seven that whoever this person
[38:05] that came up with that doctrine is gonna
[38:07] preach and you don't know what its gonna
[38:09] be and I heard some of it and it ain't
[38:11] in the Bible okay so it's their only
[38:14] revelation now brother Brown dimensions
[38:16] that many many times before the seals
[38:18] break listen to me before the seals
[38:20] break he mentions being sealed to in the
[38:23] book and on the backside of the book all
[38:26] right right because I'm going to read it
[38:28] to you right here had seven seals one
[38:30] time he said attached to the back of the
[38:32] book but now when he come to the
[38:34] revelation of those seals and that first
[38:36] seal broke he never mentioned that again
[38:39] because he knew there was only seven
[38:42] seals and then now there's mysteries
[38:45] hidden underneath that we'll look at in
[38:47] just a second but it's not seven more
[38:50] seals to be open because it you run out
[38:53] of your types and everything there's
[38:54] seven
[38:55] seals that's it all right but listen to
[38:57] what he says but I want you to get
[38:58] something I'm gonna show you something
[38:59] in a minute and there's Daniel heard the
[39:02] seven thunders and forbidden John heard
[39:05] the voices and this book was sealing
[39:06] that look and the back of the book was
[39:08] sealed with seven seals but in the days
[39:12] of those seals to be open the mystery of
[39:15] God will be finished no this is 1960 in
[39:17] the church's book in other words God
[39:20] would be known to his church not in
[39:22] three people but as one person the
[39:25] mystery of God would be revealed and
[39:27] when that was completely revealed now
[39:30] look when that was completely revealed
[39:33] then the seven mysteries would open to
[39:36] the church
[39:38] now look God being known this church
[39:42] 19:3 but he's one it's not a mystery
[39:44] that's not written in the book he's not
[39:48] talking about that he's not there's one
[39:54] God from beginning to end in this book
[39:56] okay and it's open because the first
[40:00] Church age people saw it all right the
[40:03] mystery will be revealed and when that
[40:05] was completely revealed then the seven
[40:07] mysteries would open to the church look
[40:10] because in there the church would be
[40:13] living under the inspiration of the Holy
[40:15] Spirit him moving in and out and showing
[40:17] his signs of being alive and among us
[40:19] living among us and we're then
[40:22] worshiping the Living Christ that's
[40:24] among us all right so he's showing where
[40:27] he was no watch number four 1961
[40:29] revelations chapter five this is when he
[40:31] preaches the singular messages all right
[40:35] now we turn quickly because I know
[40:36] there's a baptism of service what is
[40:39] this seventh seal book oh what a great
[40:41] thing did you notice how it says here it
[40:43] was seven seals on the back of the book
[40:45] now if I'm reading the quote it's
[40:48] something Oh may God help us now and
[40:50] give us courage and maybe sooner or
[40:52] later I can get to you get it to you
[40:55] look this is not written in the word
[40:59] it's sealed on the back of the word the
[41:03] book was sealed by these seven seals the
[41:07] whole mystery of the book
[41:08] sealed up in the seventh seal still
[41:10] there you straighten it out right there
[41:11] the whole mystery is revealed in seven
[41:13] seals but now you got to watch hold on
[41:16] this is one of the most greatest
[41:17] chapters in the whole book of Revelation
[41:20] all right which is what I saw on the
[41:25] right hand of him that said upon the
[41:26] throne a book written within and inside
[41:29] written that's what we're reading this
[41:30] morning the backside sealed with seven
[41:31] seals that's Revelations five outside
[41:34] the Bible what the Bible doesn't even
[41:38] say it's sealed in here with seven seals
[41:41] the mysteries of God now look look at me
[41:45] my quote it's sealed in here with seven
[41:48] seals you hear what it's saying right
[41:50] now what is it now notice a seal
[41:54] represents a finished product something
[41:57] that has been already tested proven and
[42:01] then sealed where is we have the earnest
[42:04] of our salvation now by being sealed
[42:06] with the Holy Spirit that is the earnest
[42:09] of our salvation everybody got that say
[42:12] Amen that's our earnest of our salvation
[42:14] but now remember he goes back to the
[42:16] boxcar remember he goes back to the
[42:21] boxcar now listen here's what we're
[42:24] going to get a little testy or are you
[42:27] going to enjoy it one of the things that
[42:30] boxcar is sealed but that doesn't mean
[42:36] the seal is the only thing actually it's
[42:41] not the most important thing what's in
[42:45] the boxcar
[42:46] it's the most important thing what
[42:49] sealed up it's the most important thing
[42:51] because this thing doesn't cost but look
[42:54] if this thing is not if it's broke then
[42:58] you do have a problem so the seat so you
[43:01] know not throwing the seals out but
[43:04] there's two things we're working on here
[43:05] the steel that's put on the box and
[43:08] what's in the box
[43:09] it means that all right say man that's
[43:13] what to me that's the important because
[43:15] it might be that seal may not cost you
[43:17] 25 cents but what's inside that box car
[43:21] may be million
[43:22] and millions of dollars and if it's not
[43:24] put in there correctly amen
[43:28] that's why brother Graham said God won't
[43:30] sell you until you I'm gonna paraphrase
[43:32] until you go through justification until
[43:35] you go through sanctification until you
[43:37] go through the baptism of Holy Ghost and
[43:39] then God accepts your faith then he what
[43:43] seals you until the day of your
[43:46] Redemption are unto the day of your
[43:49] arrival we haven't arrived yet people
[43:53] we're getting there but our arrival
[43:55] there's the body change why it flips
[44:00] people switch when I say look I'm not
[44:02] looking for a rapture sorry bored I
[44:07] don't particularly enjoy that song I'll
[44:10] see you in the rapture because that is a
[44:12] event way out under I'm gonna see them
[44:15] right here this is where I'm gonna see
[44:18] them and then we're gonna go in a
[44:19] rapture like brother Dale said you know
[44:21] I hear my theophany calling me while I
[44:23] do that Great King theophany is calling
[44:26] me but I got a theophany right here that
[44:28] is eternal amen when I die hallelujah by
[44:36] and by well that guy died that wrote
[44:38] that song but that's gonna be a people
[44:40] that's not gonna die
[44:44] the older ones got excited about that
[44:46] and the younger ones didn't wonder how
[44:48] that happens but anyway so the seal but
[44:53] remember the seal sealed something
[44:57] follow me here now because I'm going to
[44:59] give you an example and I'll hope it
[45:01] will it'll help you because many people
[45:04] say that when brother branham open the
[45:06] seals that was it
[45:07] I thought it was a divine reveal mystery
[45:11] truths were hidden under or behind those
[45:16] seals that's the Thunder that's the part
[45:20] that's gonna get us out of here knowing
[45:22] that the wild horse riders Antichrist is
[45:24] not taking us anywhere because for 54
[45:26] years we've been saying that hey man
[45:29] sorry that mean - but I'm telling you
[45:32] people are so narrow-minded like I read
[45:34] I'm gonna read that quote I'll bring
[45:36] next Sunday brother Graham said people
[45:38] so narrow-minded you could take a lead
[45:39] pencil put it between their eyes and
[45:41] they'd blind them now your prophet said
[45:45] that you know how narrow that is but how
[45:50] narrow-minded just say that brother I'm
[45:52] just open them and I said there's a
[45:54] mystery there's there there's a
[45:56] revelation there's got to come with that
[45:59] and with that revelation comes a power
[46:01] to get us out of here
[46:03] that's our goal our goal is to get the
[46:07] dead out of the ground change our bodies
[46:10] and then we go in the rapture that's
[46:12] what I'm looking for the voice of the
[46:18] resurrection and I believe the prophet
[46:22] of God said is seeing you now problem is
[46:26] is we have one big old question mark
[46:30] because so-and-so is dying and so-and-so
[46:33] died and so on so there's no they didn't
[46:42] die if they're born again they do more
[46:45] alive now than they ever have been hey
[46:47] man the dead in Christ shall rise first
[46:50] if you're not dead in Christ tonight you
[46:53] will not rise don't wait to be dead in
[46:56] Christ then there's no way you'd be dead
[46:57] in Christ and be a dead person no you
[47:00] got to be dead here we buried seven
[47:03] people like Sunday hey man all right so
[47:06] they're dead if they go on and get them
[47:08] new birth or if they already got the new
[47:09] birth they're dead and Christ
[47:11] and if they pass on their rise first
[47:15] that all right amen
[47:19] where was that number five let's read it
[47:22] real quick I don't want to be much past
[47:24] about 8:30 get y'all out of here and the
[47:28] strong angel with a loud ball I'm sorry
[47:29] revelation chapter 5 this was preached
[47:32] on 611 61 Jefferson Bell who is worthy
[47:35] who is able to do this I'm on the rock
[47:37] yeah okay and then the elder said don't
[47:40] wait for the line of the tribe of Judah
[47:42] he is worthy and he has overcome and he
[47:44] took the book and opened the book and
[47:46] loose the seals thereof he never told
[47:48] what happened to them
[47:50] he just loosed them right when we hit
[47:54] them seven seals being open right down
[47:56] through the Bible servants the prophets
[48:03] right amen
[48:05] we're gonna see that we're gonna see how
[48:06] that they all had something to do with
[48:08] the open of these seals a man because
[48:11] this is a complete plan of redemption
[48:12] you can't leave a prophet out no prophet
[48:17] watch when we hit them seven seals being
[48:21] opened right down through the Bible
[48:22] watch what took place right in this
[48:25] seven sealed book that we're into enter
[48:28] now holds the whole mystery of all the
[48:32] redemption blessings of God brother wait
[48:35] I thought that revealed the devil please
[48:39] people please what we'll talk about in a
[48:43] minute remember here's the lamb he's the
[48:49] only one that redeeming you know why cuz
[48:51] it's his book you can't redeem it he's
[48:54] the only one that can redeem it hey man
[48:57] number six revelation of Jesus Christ is
[49:01] preached on six eighteen nineteen
[49:02] sixty-one I've tried to put them in
[49:04] chronological order showing how that he
[49:06] he'd come up toward the opening of the
[49:09] seals and how his his revelation
[49:12] progressed and getting down to the last
[49:14] verse of this scripture portion up here
[49:15] a part of the scripture we will bring in
[49:17] the seventy weeks of Daniel and the last
[49:19] three weeks tied in with the Pentecostal
[49:20] Jubilee that brings in the people to the
[49:22] last seal then be sitting ready for the
[49:24] lamb to open the seals now we know we've
[49:26] been through Daniel 70 weeks and we know
[49:27] for a fact that if we didn't get the
[49:29] right revelation of Daniel 70 weeks that
[49:31] it's not three and a half years that
[49:32] it's seven years after the rapture of
[49:35] the church you couldn't put it in in the
[49:36] seventh seal
[49:37] brother Brown said that he said you
[49:39] can't get it lined up and you can't get
[49:41] it lined up without the true revelation
[49:43] of those seventh of the Daniel 70 weeks
[49:47] mmm that was wonderful how did that the
[49:50] Lord showed us to do that in a in a
[49:52] Jewish way because it's a Jewish it's to
[49:55] Daniel and his people right there was to
[49:57] Daniel in his people
[49:58] so when we started putting the feast
[50:00] days in and start watch that all come
[50:02] together man it was just
[50:03] karbolyn number six revelation I read
[50:08] okay and remember the seals are a
[50:10] mysterious thing the book was sealed and
[50:14] it was on the back now watch here's we
[50:16] said at seven seals that was not even
[50:19] revealed in the book these things are
[50:22] not even written in the Bible now I want
[50:25] to point something to you it's got to
[50:27] compare with every Scripture in the
[50:28] Bible so now let's get the point right
[50:32] here stop right here it's gonna do it in
[50:33] a minute but let's do it right now
[50:35] Thunder number one is not written in a
[50:38] scripture a scripture like the seven
[50:42] seals the seven seals are written in a
[50:44] scripture revelation 6:1 says and when
[50:46] an angel won't one of the seals
[50:48] revelation 6 2 or 3 says when the angel
[50:50] opens second seal there is no scripture
[50:53] that says thunder one open thunder to
[50:55] open okay is that all right that's what
[50:58] he's talking about cuz look I was
[51:01] telling them back in the back seven
[51:03] seals have been preached twice actually
[51:10] thank you Lord three times Daniel 9 the
[51:16] six fold purpose is exactly the opening
[51:19] of the seals to the Jews it's the seal
[51:22] of redemption how they got redeemed is
[51:25] the six fold purpose then Jesus preached
[51:28] them in Matthew 24 and then William
[51:30] Branham preached them in 1963 so this is
[51:34] nothing new nothing new but watch I want
[51:41] you to see something maybe it'll help
[51:42] you right here in just a minute these
[51:45] things were not even written in the
[51:46] Bible so he's not saying that there's
[51:49] something outside see that's where they
[51:51] got they thought he was saying it was
[51:52] something written outside no it's just
[51:55] not something thunder one is thunder two
[51:58] is that's what John was told not to
[52:00] write when those thunders open there
[52:02] under their voices John was getting
[52:04] ready to write it down
[52:05] God said seal it up till the time of the
[52:08] end all right now look but if anybody
[52:11] would give an interpretation of it it
[52:13] would have to compare with the rest of
[52:15] the Bible Oh
[52:17] I'm sure you're going to get a blessing
[52:20] out of this or I think you will I'm
[52:21] trusting you with all right so the seven
[52:25] seals are written in the Bible Matthew
[52:29] 24 revelation 6 and Daniel 9 about 26 or
[52:36] 25 what's that all right written down
[52:39] what they are when they are open when
[52:44] revelation 6:1 not exactly the day but
[52:47] the revelation 6:1 seven said come and
[52:49] see and said when the first Hill opened
[52:50] this happen
[52:51] okay all right that all right everybody
[52:53] say Amen now look number 7 1961 6:18
[52:57] revelations chapter 5 number 2 as soon
[53:00] as he advertised who is worthy he was
[53:02] advertising the coming of the kinsman
[53:04] redeemer and here he stood a lamb and
[53:06] what did he do walked over to the throne
[53:09] where the Spirit of God was at and took
[53:12] the book out of the right hand the right
[53:14] hand of him that said upon the throne
[53:16] and all the elders fell down and said
[53:19] thou aren't worthy because thou was
[53:20] slain see and then he began became then
[53:24] excuse me his book or at least the book
[53:27] of redemption or the book of
[53:29] intercession in the church age was
[53:30] finished now he becomes the Redeemer
[53:33] now the revealing of how he did it is
[53:36] going to be in those seven seals now we
[53:41] notice in like when the book of the
[53:42] mediatorial work of him was done the
[53:44] work was finished now in the first three
[53:46] chapters of the church finished
[53:49] revelation is one two and three
[53:51] everybody got that revelation is one two
[53:53] and three everybody with me on this and
[53:55] by with me okay all right but now
[53:57] Redemption he doesn't say the devil's to
[54:01] be revealed
[54:02] he said Redemption is to be revealed
[54:06] what is it now when he took this book
[54:09] see that's the people's problem they saw
[54:11] brother Branham open the seven seals and
[54:13] I said I'll prove it to you in just a
[54:16] minute
[54:16] redemption is to be revealed what is it
[54:19] now when he took this book now trying to
[54:21] put on your deep thinking so don't be
[54:24] scared
[54:24] put on your deep thinking cuz we ever
[54:27] get these seven nights you're going to
[54:29] get it now
[54:29] they didn't though he said they didn't
[54:33] get it alright now let's read Gables
[54:35] instructions to Daniel and we'll try to
[54:38] show you something here then we find out
[54:39] Gables instructions Daniel 7:13 1961 we
[54:43] find out that this was sealed with seven
[54:45] seals look and each seal was wrapped
[54:49] around and as the revelation come forth
[54:53] he pulled the seal and undone this read
[54:58] what that seal said and then he undone
[55:04] the next one the scroll and read what
[55:06] that seal said undone the next one it
[55:09] pulled it out and see what that seal
[55:11] said and what the revelation was that's
[55:15] exactly what our seven seals that we're
[55:18] going into shortly we trust that we'll
[55:20] do each seal when it's took off the book
[55:22] will be unrolled and that'll show
[55:24] exactly what taken place that all right
[55:28] say ma'am so now here is our problem in
[55:33] the message brother random open the
[55:37] seals told us that it was the white
[55:40] horse rider was the Antichrist right we
[55:44] didn't take a rapture when he took one
[55:46] yet he saw we're waiting on a date god
[55:51] only knows that day I thought brother
[55:55] Brown said he was waiting on you and I
[55:57] wrapped her time in the adoption series
[56:00] right now remember there was no books
[56:06] back in the Old Testament they were
[56:08] Scrolls
[56:09] you just read we leave this up don't
[56:10] take this off each seal was wrapped
[56:13] around and as a revelation come forth he
[56:15] pulled the seal and undone this and read
[56:17] what that seal said everybody got that
[56:20] say man now look you want to see
[56:25] something tonight this is what I want
[56:27] you to see this is this the seal no this
[56:35] is not the seal
[56:36] this is the seal if you can't see it
[56:39] from back there this is seal says Lamb
[56:41] of God I took it out of analyst Sunday
[56:43] School class look this is not the seal
[56:50] this is a seal brother branham said when
[56:56] the seals will be revealed it'll be the
[56:59] seals we got a revelation of what that
[57:04] sale was what about this come on read
[57:09] your quote in a minute we're brother
[57:11] Branham says the seals is one thing and
[57:13] the thunders is another that's why we
[57:17] took a rapture people because we think
[57:18] this is it we think this is it
[57:22] this is just the beginning this just
[57:25] opens so we can see that you see that
[57:31] see that that's what we're missing
[57:36] we think that's it that's the white
[57:40] horse crop rider was the Antichrist
[57:42] therefore he goes away and then we get
[57:45] what's written under that seal did we
[57:49] not read where brother Branham said what
[57:50] will be the remissed Rees contained in
[57:52] the seven seals the thunders are the
[57:55] mystery containing say it was the seal
[57:58] I'm gonna read you a quote I got a quote
[58:03] where brother Branham said two seals one
[58:05] thing and the thunders a totally
[58:07] different thing
[58:08] hey we got this right brother Branham
[58:12] totally explained what this was the wild
[58:16] horse rider was not the Holy Ghost
[58:18] it was the Antichrist but when it rode
[58:21] away here's your revelation sure that
[58:27] was a revelation but that only got us to
[58:29] this the box seal kept people from
[58:33] seeing what was inside the box car I'm
[58:39] gonna read you right here let's look
[58:40] it's real quick an extra eight verse
[58:42] eight right he also for the Jews as it
[58:45] likened you in the King's name and seal
[58:47] it with the king's ring now look for the
[58:50] writing which was written in the King's
[58:53] name and sealed with the Kings ring may
[58:56] no man reverse now was it the seal that
[58:58] condemned the people or what was written
[59:00] was condemning the people it was this it
[59:03] was just sealed sure this was important
[59:14] because without that you can't see
[59:16] what's inside
[59:18] but that night when those seals were
[59:21] opened brother Bram told us what this
[59:22] was yeah
[59:25] afterwards he told us what this was
[59:28] because remember the Thunder is the
[59:31] voice of God when the seal breaks breaks
[59:36] when it's broke not while I still see
[59:40] when it's broke so you say well you
[59:44] gotta you got something going now watch
[59:45] let's read it now watch when the King
[59:50] sealed it the important part was the
[59:53] riding behind it everybody got that say
[59:55] man
[59:55] all right everybody got that say Amen
[59:58] all right this is the seal this is what
[1:00:01] seal number one was no this was actually
[1:00:04] still number two God is king this is the
[1:00:06] second one I pulled up but you
[1:00:07] understand what I mean
[1:00:08] seal one was pulled off and what the the
[1:00:11] first the first combat beast said come
[1:00:15] and see and what did the combat be
[1:00:18] showing the combat beast is not a
[1:00:20] prophet it's the Holy Ghost we know that
[1:00:23] but it's not the Prophet to reveal right
[1:00:27] come and see what this seal is but you
[1:00:33] gotta remember there's something behind
[1:00:35] that there's something behind that seal
[1:00:39] it has to be made known that were
[1:00:43] literally because this has not turned us
[1:00:45] back this will turn us back this will
[1:00:49] turn us home
[1:00:50] I mean onto a body change hey man listen
[1:00:56] not saying in people gonna say well now
[1:00:58] you're saying brother Brown no if it
[1:01:01] hadn't been for him he broke this thing
[1:01:04] only a profit only God Himself can show
[1:01:11] you what this is only God himself look
[1:01:16] this has already been preached in
[1:01:19] Matthew 24 and in revelation 6 the
[1:01:23] problem was we said it was the Holy
[1:01:25] Ghost the Bible never said it was the
[1:01:28] holy goat the Bible never said that it
[1:01:31] was this and that man said that was the
[1:01:35] whole ego right because brother Branham
[1:01:38] says we'll read in a minute he said
[1:01:40] we're only presuming what if he doesn't
[1:01:43] come what the one that knows all this
[1:01:47] amen that all right say Amen but see
[1:01:51] that I believe that will help you the
[1:01:53] seals are broke this was the revelation
[1:01:56] of the seal the wild horse riders ran
[1:01:58] across the second one is the red horse
[1:02:00] rider and what he did and the black
[1:02:01] horse rider all that that's what this is
[1:02:04] but it's not this right it's contained
[1:02:08] in it's contained in but it's not this
[1:02:13] that's why we're still here everybody
[1:02:15] thinks this is it this is not it cuz I
[1:02:20] promise what I'll tell you right here
[1:02:22] because remember in 1962 brother Brown
[1:02:25] preached is this the sign of the answer
[1:02:27] remember what happened with all that
[1:02:28] vision and thunder and all the things
[1:02:30] happening he was kind of he was worried
[1:02:33] it was the end of the world he was
[1:02:34] worried it was into him it was where
[1:02:35] there was a lot of things he was worried
[1:02:36] about but watch what he says right here
[1:02:38] says look where the voices was the
[1:02:41] thunders not in heaven on earth the
[1:02:46] thunders never uttered from the heavens
[1:02:48] they uttered from the earth now I want
[1:02:51] you to think just for a minute how many
[1:02:53] times how many times have I showed you
[1:02:57] where brother Branham talks about the
[1:02:59] book of Redemption right the seven
[1:03:05] sealed book is a book of redemption not
[1:03:09] the book of the devil it's exposing the
[1:03:12] devil it makes him go away
[1:03:14] it exposes what you thought
[1:03:18] was previously a revelation right amen
[1:03:25] but the thunders never utter from
[1:03:28] heavens they uttered from the earth now
[1:03:31] remember one thing give me a key the
[1:03:35] thunders the voice of God when the seal
[1:03:36] breaks they break down here why don't
[1:03:39] they break in heaven why why don't they
[1:03:46] break in heaven it's such a it's just a
[1:03:48] great mystery why not start up there
[1:03:52] redemption is not up there read em sit
[1:03:56] down here there's a key there's a key
[1:04:02] it's not written in the book people but
[1:04:05] it's written in every chapter of the
[1:04:07] Bible only one thing Redemption amen he
[1:04:12] said we're brother I'm redeemed not
[1:04:14] until you get a buddy change right right
[1:04:18] you have the earnest of your inheritance
[1:04:21] until the purchased possession because
[1:04:23] you're sealed what to your destination
[1:04:28] but when you get to that destination is
[1:04:31] God gonna open your box car and walk in
[1:04:33] and go where's the stuff where's the
[1:04:39] goods where's where's the revelation no
[1:04:45] it's empty we don't want that to happen
[1:04:47] do we
[1:04:47] yeah ma'am being silly but it's the
[1:04:50] truth
[1:04:51] no look let's read this is this a sign
[1:04:54] of the end sir they uttered from the
[1:04:57] earth Nene he reads and I was about to
[1:05:01] write when I heard a voice from heaven
[1:05:02] saying unto me seal capital SCAL seal up
[1:05:06] those things which the seven thunders
[1:05:07] uttered and write them not it is on the
[1:05:10] backside when a book is completed not
[1:05:13] did he say on the front side he said on
[1:05:15] the backside after it's all done
[1:05:17] completed then the seven Thunder voices
[1:05:21] is the only thing that's stuck to the
[1:05:23] book there's not revealed it's not that
[1:05:29] it's
[1:05:36] listen and people will misunderstand me
[1:05:39] but we're beyond this we're told to go
[1:05:43] beyond this we're beyond this this has
[1:05:46] already been preached it's not even
[1:05:53] written in the book let's go the next
[1:05:54] one God hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:05:56] then revealing himself in the same now I
[1:05:59] don't know what these things mean I'm
[1:06:00] just as much at the end of my wits to
[1:06:02] them as perhaps some of you are this
[1:06:03] morning we have ecclesiastical ideas
[1:06:06] that's been presented by man but that
[1:06:08] will never touch it and if you will see
[1:06:11] it has to come by inspiration it must be
[1:06:16] God Himself is the only one who can do
[1:06:20] it the lamb and tonight is that book of
[1:06:23] redemption of what he preached the night
[1:06:26] after God and simplicity he preached the
[1:06:29] breach all right which was the book of
[1:06:33] redemption so now we're going to read
[1:06:35] number 11 the breach between the seven
[1:06:37] churches and seven seals now notice the
[1:06:39] seven seals holds the mystery didn't say
[1:06:42] it is the mystery it holds the mystery
[1:06:44] what does this seal do it holds what's
[1:06:48] behind it it holds it but when its open
[1:06:53] its loosed you know what we've done the
[1:07:05] seven seals holds the mystery of the
[1:07:07] book until we can see what those seven
[1:07:10] seals has sealed in right
[1:07:14] we're only presuming them things you
[1:07:23] don't think a prophet knew when he's
[1:07:24] talking about me what he's talking about
[1:07:27] now look number 49 let's to save time
[1:07:30] now notice seven seals on the book has
[1:07:33] that these seven seals has the book
[1:07:36] sealed see the book is absolutely sealed
[1:07:39] do you see it the book is absolutely a
[1:07:42] sealed book until the seven
[1:07:44] seals is broken right it is sealed up
[1:07:48] with seven seals now that's different
[1:07:53] from the seven thunders so I prove that
[1:07:57] that's different he knew it was
[1:08:00] different that's different from the
[1:08:03] seven thunders see this is seven seals
[1:08:06] on the book and the book will not the
[1:08:08] seals will not be released until the
[1:08:11] message of the seventh angel sea so we
[1:08:14] are presuming but the genuine revelation
[1:08:17] of God will be made perfect in that
[1:08:20] sounding and vindicated truth now that's
[1:08:24] exactly what the word said the mystery
[1:08:26] should be finished at that time and this
[1:08:29] seven seal book remember it was closed
[1:08:32] here in Revelations five and in
[1:08:34] Revelations 10 it is open that's why the
[1:08:37] thunders could what go forth because the
[1:08:40] book was open then he said John ah don't
[1:08:44] wreck that all right let's finish what I
[1:08:50] get to 51 and now we're going to see
[1:08:52] what that book says about how it became
[1:08:55] open and it is not made known until the
[1:08:59] lamb takes the book and breaks the seals
[1:09:01] and opens the book the Lambs got to take
[1:09:08] the book is his anyway in the Lord amen
[1:09:12] so we've had 54 years the seven seals
[1:09:20] has been revealed as the seven thunders
[1:09:25] been revealed that's the question to you
[1:09:30] but remember I'm gonna read this quote
[1:09:33] and I'll read it again sunday 1962 is
[1:09:36] this the time sir they don't have it in
[1:09:37] the back Matthew 13 verse 11 Jesus told
[1:09:44] them said the mysteries are for you to
[1:09:47] know the mysteries of the kingdom are
[1:09:49] for you to know a member Scofield you
[1:09:52] know puts them down like 1 through 13
[1:09:53] whatever anyway brother branham reason
[1:09:55] but listen this is quote the mysteries
[1:09:58] here is the mystery Tama a mystery is
[1:10:01] Scripture kama is a previously hidden
[1:10:05] truth now divinely revealed but which is
[1:10:11] a supernatural element still remains
[1:10:14] despite the revelation
[1:10:16] despite the revelation there's a
[1:10:19] supernatural element that goes with this
[1:10:21] and it's going to take a supernatural
[1:10:24] people to understand them and it's not
[1:10:26] gonna be something you can't read you
[1:10:29] read it every day if you read the Bible
[1:10:32] every day then all right say man now
[1:10:39] watch this is in the breach between the
[1:10:42] church ages and the seals 1963 3:17
[1:10:45] alright
[1:10:47] but then he promises that when that time
[1:10:48] has finished out there'll be the
[1:10:50] sounding of the seventh angels voice and
[1:10:52] then the book will be revealed at that
[1:10:54] time now don't say nobody them people
[1:10:57] ain't saved back there but the mysteries
[1:11:00] that they couldn't understand she was
[1:11:03] talking about look the shark can't
[1:11:04] understand weep cuz it's not it grew
[1:11:07] from the same life of the week but the
[1:11:10] wheat went right through it out to the
[1:11:12] end and that shuck was a protector don't
[1:11:16] kick them out but they won't be ere the
[1:11:20] seed won't be heir all right now nobody
[1:11:25] but the mysteries that they couldn't
[1:11:26] understand how that God can be three and
[1:11:29] yet one how that the scripture said
[1:11:31] baptized name Father Son Holy Ghost and
[1:11:32] turn around say baptized the name of
[1:11:33] Jesus see old many things how can I eat
[1:11:36] an apple and cause the wreckage of the
[1:11:37] whole world see how can these things be
[1:11:39] but those mysteries are promised to be
[1:11:41] revealed at the end time it's little
[1:11:44] loose ends that these great warriors has
[1:11:46] come on the scene such as Iranians
[1:11:48] Martin st. Martin public art and the
[1:11:49] different ones of Luther Wesley and all
[1:11:51] these see how they have come and just
[1:11:53] lived long enough to kind of bring a
[1:11:55] light and shine it but they left many
[1:11:57] things in the darkness along come the
[1:12:01] Pentecostal age like the Lutheran age
[1:12:03] they run out on a limb but still all
[1:12:06] right don't say they wasn't right they
[1:12:08] were but there's loosens left that they
[1:12:11] can
[1:12:12] that can't be explained but then why the
[1:12:15] seals hasn't been broke to thoroughly
[1:12:17] reveal what these things are I want to
[1:12:21] ask you a question let's stop right here
[1:12:23] I was telling the guys in the back
[1:12:25] brother branham said marriage and
[1:12:27] divorce was revealed in the seals right
[1:12:28] show me one time he preached on marriage
[1:12:30] and divorce in seal yeah show me brother
[1:12:38] Ram says surplus he was revealed in seal
[1:12:39] sure he made a few quotes about serpent
[1:12:41] seed but he him preached on sir
[1:12:43] proceedings he'll let me give you a real
[1:12:46] good one he was getting ready to preach
[1:12:49] the seven trumpets God told him he
[1:12:53] supernaturally preached him in the sixth
[1:12:55] seal I want you to go to that sixth seal
[1:12:57] and show me but about two quotes about
[1:12:59] the seven trumpets he said they were
[1:13:04] supernaturally preached so you can't
[1:13:07] tell me you've Dana Dana I don't care
[1:13:09] for message preachers being a message
[1:13:11] 150-year cannot tell me that everything
[1:13:14] was broke when the seals broke the seals
[1:13:16] broke to show what we're seeing now to
[1:13:21] show one group of people you and I the
[1:13:24] children that can understand the seals
[1:13:35] hasn't been broke to thoroughly reveal
[1:13:36] what these things are see but then in
[1:13:39] the last age all these mysteries are to
[1:13:41] be solved and handed out and the seals
[1:13:44] are to be open by the lamb and reveal to
[1:13:47] the church and then time is no more how
[1:13:50] beautiful then the book then is the book
[1:13:54] of redemption so you can't make this a
[1:13:59] revelation of the devil this is sure
[1:14:03] it's revealing or exposing him so you
[1:14:06] can get the true revelation of this the
[1:14:09] book of redemption
[1:14:12] brother Branham many times in the breech
[1:14:14] calls it the seven sealed book of
[1:14:16] redemption
[1:14:17] why keep people get Redemption it's the
[1:14:20] simplest thing it is to me it's the
[1:14:22] absolute simplest doctrine that we
[1:14:25] ever have had its oldest doctrine Jesus
[1:14:30] said you must be born again
[1:14:31] oh but it's a higher form it's not just
[1:14:37] here gotta go on amen
[1:14:40] we know that but remember I'm staying on
[1:14:44] the fountain we gotta get a foundation
[1:14:45] here mm-hmm number thirteen the breach
[1:14:49] twenty seventh seals in the church ages
[1:14:52] paragraph 142 and revealed as the seals
[1:14:55] break and are released to us then we can
[1:14:59] see what this great plan of the devil is
[1:15:03] oh sorry then we can see what this great
[1:15:11] plan of redemption is and when and how
[1:15:15] it's going to be done that tip right
[1:15:18] there it's all hidden in this book of
[1:15:21] mystery the seven thunders people is the
[1:15:24] revelation of supreme Redemption but it
[1:15:33] was sealed with these little things
[1:15:34] around here so the man couldn't see the
[1:15:39] problem is we think this is it this is
[1:15:42] just the beginning this is to let me and
[1:15:46] you know that this has been what broke
[1:15:48] and there's something behind it we
[1:15:55] thought this was powerful the devil only
[1:15:59] gets remember our if you'd been
[1:16:01] downstairs you hear me say revelation
[1:16:03] six power was given power was given
[1:16:06] power was given
[1:16:08] now who gives God power nobody he is the
[1:16:12] power he gives Satan permitted power but
[1:16:17] when the power of God comes guess what
[1:16:20] you get a break amen
[1:16:23] that all right we're man then when we
[1:16:29] see what this great plan of redemption
[1:16:31] is and when and how it's going to be
[1:16:34] done it's all hidden in this book of
[1:16:37] mystery here
[1:16:39] it's sealed up with seven seals you see
[1:16:41] where he separated the two so as the
[1:16:44] lamb as they don't so the lamb is the
[1:16:46] only one who can break them and the
[1:16:49] whole thing here the seven seals got the
[1:16:51] mysteries of God from the foundation of
[1:16:54] the world all sealed up in there and
[1:16:57] revealed by seven different seals then
[1:17:01] if God willing let him let us pull back
[1:17:04] those seals look pull back those seals
[1:17:07] and look down through the book and find
[1:17:10] out what it's all about oh I hope we
[1:17:12] have a great time there the mystery of
[1:17:14] redemption is sealed until this book
[1:17:17] could not be broken until the last
[1:17:19] angels message the scrolls there we
[1:17:23] knowed it was there we know it was
[1:17:26] redemption we believed it was redemption
[1:17:29] number fourteen I see the mystery of the
[1:17:32] seven sealed book will be revealed at
[1:17:33] the sounding of the seventh church
[1:17:35] 'angels message see the seventh angel
[1:17:37] begins to sound and there's the mountain
[1:17:40] boy did he ever D tell him where it was
[1:17:43] that read that he just told you where it
[1:17:48] was that look
[1:17:50] he said now the mystery of the seven C
[1:17:51] book were revealed at the sounding of
[1:17:53] the Scimitar today's message see the
[1:17:55] seventh angel message seventh angel
[1:17:56] begins the sound and there's the tapes
[1:17:59] there's the tapes there's the messages
[1:18:02] wrote out there and we got it in tape
[1:18:04] and book form he told him he said you
[1:18:06] got it it's right here
[1:18:09] study it now at the beginning of the
[1:18:14] sounding of the message the mystery of
[1:18:15] God should be finished see at that time
[1:18:17] now we will notice the book of the
[1:18:19] mystery of God is not revealed unto the
[1:18:21] seven angels message is sounded now
[1:18:25] these points will be important in the
[1:18:26] seals I'm sure cuz this every bit tie
[1:18:28] write together
[1:18:29] now it's wrote mysterious because no man
[1:18:32] nowhere knows that God alone Jesus
[1:18:34] Christ now but it is a book a mysterious
[1:18:38] book it's a book of redemption we'll get
[1:18:42] into that in a little while and now we
[1:18:44] know that this book of redemption will
[1:18:46] not be thoroughly understood
[1:18:49] it's probed at through six church age
[1:18:53] but at the end when the seventh angel
[1:18:54] begins to sound his message he winds up
[1:18:56] all the loose ends all right so let's go
[1:18:58] down to the bottom soon save time now
[1:19:01] you see I'm just not making that up
[1:19:03] that's the it's thus saith the Lord
[1:19:06] I'll read it to you out of the book the
[1:19:08] sounding of the seventh angels message
[1:19:10] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:19:11] that's been declared by his holy
[1:19:14] prophets
[1:19:15] that's the prophets who has wrote the
[1:19:18] word at the sounding of the seventh
[1:19:22] churches the last church age all the
[1:19:24] loose ends that through these church
[1:19:26] ages have been proved that will be wound
[1:19:28] up together and when the seals are broke
[1:19:31] and the mystery is revealed down comes
[1:19:35] the angel the messenger Christ that's my
[1:19:37] brother promising and Christ the mystery
[1:19:39] of God revealed he said if you missed
[1:19:41] the seals come back to this message will
[1:19:43] understood read later on but come back
[1:19:45] to this message Christ is the mystery of
[1:19:48] God reveal sending his foot upon the
[1:19:51] land upon the sea with the rainbow over
[1:19:53] his head and now remember this seventh
[1:19:54] angel is on earth at the time of this
[1:19:57] coming right you know what our problem
[1:20:01] was and I know it spelled different but
[1:20:06] I just I was standing somewhere the
[1:20:09] other day and there was a pregnant lady
[1:20:14] and I don't know if she was talking
[1:20:16] about a breech birth or the her baby was
[1:20:19] breached or the thought came to my mind
[1:20:21] now I know the breech that he preached
[1:20:25] it's not the same spelling but think
[1:20:28] about it there was a baby
[1:20:35] hear me out a minute there was a baby
[1:20:37] that was turned in the wrong direction
[1:20:41] through seven Church ages there was a
[1:20:43] baby that could not be born the right
[1:20:46] way so he had to preach the breech for
[1:20:50] the redemption to come to turn that baby
[1:20:52] around and through seven seals that baby
[1:20:54] was born
[1:20:58] let's stand her feet god bless your
[1:21:01] heart I know it's not spelled the same
[1:21:03] but it means the same to me he had to
[1:21:05] preach the breech there had to be
[1:21:08] something brought us from where we were
[1:21:10] because not that our birth was wrong
[1:21:13] because you can have a breech birth
[1:21:15] but you birthed in the wrong direction
[1:21:19] but when you're turned that was all of
[1:21:22] us brother Donny but when you're turned
[1:21:24] literally turn it takes you right back
[1:21:30] total Redemption all right let's sing
[1:21:34] something I hope that was okay we'll
[1:21:42] bring out some more quotes and bring
[1:21:44] some more things next Sunday afternoon
[1:21:46] but remember this is what we're looking
[1:21:51] for we know what the seals are we know
[1:21:56] what the seals are we're looking for the
[1:21:58] thunder the thunder that's inside
[1:22:01] there's never been known by man you said
[1:22:03] well brother the plan of redemption is
[1:22:05] so simple thank you John had no problem
[1:22:10] beginning to write down what he saw John
[1:22:15] was redeemed John didn't say now Lord I
[1:22:25] don't know what that means I don't even
[1:22:27] know what I don't write it so there's a
[1:22:32] group of people even the first church
[1:22:34] age second third all the way up did not
[1:22:38] understand total Redemption Paul spoke
[1:22:42] of it he said I see through a glass
[1:22:44] darkly I look at these things he said
[1:22:46] but I see Jesus comes remember we'll
[1:22:50] talk about when we get in the seals
[1:22:52] remember Christ is the seventh seal we
[1:22:55] know that we know that that's that's
[1:22:57] perfectly honest he preached six seals
[1:22:59] there were six there was a six full
[1:23:02] purpose there were six seals brother
[1:23:03] Branham says and I got the quote brother
[1:23:05] mom said six seals finishes Redemption
[1:23:07] it finishes the redemption
[1:23:10] man six he'll finish his Redemption and
[1:23:12] Christ is the seventh seal but now
[1:23:14] remember what seal was broke by Christ
[1:23:19] he preached six right he preached six
[1:23:24] heals he told him what it was they asked
[1:23:26] him three questions he answered all
[1:23:28] three right but the mystery was that
[1:23:31] that man that was dead walked out of a
[1:23:36] tomb and broke the seal that was put on
[1:23:40] there was a Roman seal put over that
[1:23:42] door and that seal that was put over
[1:23:45] that door said no man can get in and no
[1:23:48] man can get out but guess what he didn't
[1:23:53] need to roll that stone away we know
[1:23:55] that he rolled it away as a symbol
[1:23:58] because he broke that seal angel didn't
[1:24:01] break it
[1:24:01] I believe Christ Himself broke that seal
[1:24:03] and he stepped right out and guess what
[1:24:05] when his precious feet hit the earth it
[1:24:07] was a glorified body
[1:24:09] there's your seventh theme it's a
[1:24:12] glorified condition all right let's sing
[1:24:14] a song god bless you 194 194 say one or
[1:24:18] two verses and then we'll go nations
