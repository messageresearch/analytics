[7:53] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[7:55] according as his divine power has given
[7:57] unto all of us all things that pertain
[8:01] unto life and godliness through the
[8:04] knowledge of him that have called us to
[8:06] glory and virtue whereby are given to us
[8:08] exceeding great and precious promises
[8:10] that by these you might be partakers of
[8:13] the divine nature having escaped the
[8:15] corruption that is in the world through
[8:18] lust and besides this now besides
[8:21] escaping the corruption besides being a
[8:24] protector of the same things I've been a
[8:29] part of His divine nature and taking
[8:32] home and says now and beside this giving
[8:34] all diligence add to your faith virtue

[8:39] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[8:40] patience and to patience godliness in to
[8:43] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[8:45] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[8:47] things be in you and abound they make
[8:49] you that you shall neither be barren nor
[8:52] unfruitful
[8:52] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[8:55] Christ you may be seated the Lord at his
[8:57] blessing to the reading of the word now
[9:02] we'll try to try to skip through some of
[9:08] it but seem like it didn't work so we'll
[9:10] go through a little part not review much
[9:13] but do a little and then if you would I
[9:17] ask you to read the message blasphemous
[9:21] names we may not get to it you know
[9:25] right now but we're going to go into it
[9:29] when we get there and see the things and
[9:31] what I'm trying to get you to see it was
[9:34] remind I've had a two or three people to
[9:36] remind me lately of something they heard
[9:38] the Prophet site you ever heard him say
[9:41] you know you can be born again and then
[9:44] be baptized into the body born again
[9:49] baptized into the body that sounds like
[9:51] two parts that sounds like a split
[9:55] condition that sounds like like but you
[9:58] know what that's what I'm trying to get
[10:00] you to see that's what I'm dealing with
[10:04] with second theater that's what I
[10:05] believe second theaters doing first
[10:08] Peter he's done covered that you're
[10:10] you're being born again by the
[10:12] incorruptible Word of God then he comes
[10:14] in to second Peter to start off and
[10:16] telling us about these things that we're
[10:19] partakers of the divine nature and how
[10:22] that those things are there at the new
[10:25] birth and we start our journey add to
[10:28] your faith faith is not an ad faith is a
[10:32] birth so you're born into the body of
[10:36] Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy
[10:38] Ghost
[10:38] all right then these are the things he
[10:41] expects you to add honor growth
[10:44] development are the stature of a perfect
[10:48] man see adding to yours but see it's
[10:51] added to faith all right and bringing it
[10:56] for see from the new birth all the way
[11:00] up that's what I want you to think about
[11:02] today now to where we'll keep it
[11:04] straight because we are
[11:06] just a little background to cover it
[11:08] that see the Prophet teaches in the
[11:12] statute of perfect man he says now how
[11:14] faith and be born again all right that
[11:18] ought to be enough to for us to think
[11:20] about you know how faith and be born
[11:22] again once you're born again at faith
[11:24] you look at the pyramid and you see
[11:26] faith well brother they're left down at
[11:28] the bottom that's right you're gonna try
[11:30] to start your journey to top but the
[11:32] mote had a good point about it he said
[11:34] and brother Howard brother Howell
[11:38] Thomas would tell you in a hurry don't
[11:40] try to miss him rungs on the ladder
[11:42] you're going to get hurt so don't say
[11:46] well I'll just run and jump up here well
[11:48] I just need to be up here I don't need
[11:49] to all this others too I just run up
[11:51] here to talk well now how you gonna get
[11:53] there then you've got to start at the
[11:57] bottom and grow up that would be like a
[11:59] baby saying well okay we just had a baby
[12:02] the other day but what you gonna do well
[12:03] we're not gonna feed it we're not gonna
[12:05] do nothing we just leave it laying there
[12:06] in let's jump up the top by itself it'll
[12:08] it'll feed itself it'll get out and
[12:10] raise a garden and that's our stupidity
[12:13] right see that's what I'm trying to get
[12:16] you to see is that you're born again by
[12:20] faith if Peter was saying and see Peter
[12:25] then covers I've said second Peter he
[12:28] talks about being born again by the
[12:30] corruptible incorruptible Word of God
[12:31] all right and then he comes over to tell
[12:34] us how to become where he was at because
[12:38] he was teaching this statue of perfect
[12:41] man in other words how do we come to
[12:42] that place he was and he says now of
[12:45] them of like precious faith so everybody
[12:51] that has the new birth has like precious
[12:53] faith all right and see by having that
[12:58] new birth being born again he it puts us
[13:03] into the body of Christ and we'll go
[13:05] into adoption next and get into the
[13:08] things but I want you to get into
[13:10] blasphemous names and we'll be covering
[13:12] sister Sheppard's dream and things just
[13:15] to try to cover a little bit on that you
[13:17] know in the next message or so
[13:19] want you to think about butter Braun
[13:21] says have faith and be born again he
[13:23] said that's the foundation he said you
[13:27] laid the foundation by your faith all
[13:30] right in other words then and then when
[13:32] you get to the sister Sheppard's dream
[13:34] you'll hear him say that God accepted
[13:38] her foundation for her beginning because
[13:42] that was the dream and the things that
[13:44] she was worried about whether she had to
[13:46] hold a ghost or not all right we should
[13:49] be concerned today whether or not we
[13:51] have the Holy Spirit more than anything
[13:52] in the world well brother Dale I believe
[13:56] I got it cause I done so and so don't
[13:58] put it on what you doing they'll never
[14:01] put anything with God on what you've
[14:03] done put on there what he says and what
[14:06] he's telling us all right so it's how
[14:09] faith and be born again that's your
[14:12] foundation well then these are the
[14:14] things the Prophet said God expects us
[14:17] to add all right now how are we going to
[14:20] add them you know one time he'll say you
[14:24] add one time he'll save God adds well
[14:26] well yeah that's the way it is God gives
[14:28] us the word as we risk as we study it
[14:32] make it oh you know the part he's made
[14:35] it available and we study it and as we
[14:38] study the word then he can bring these
[14:40] virtues into being into each and every
[14:43] one of us all right and doing it that
[14:46] way cause he deals you know each
[14:49] individually deals differently yes but
[14:51] still it's the same situation the birth
[14:55] is the birth it doesn't matter whether
[14:57] you're 80 years old ten years old
[14:59] whether you're this that or the other
[15:00] the birth is the same it's the birth of
[15:03] the word all right see then that word is
[15:07] it's made alive into our hearts that
[15:09] foundation is what holds us up and then
[15:12] we're being born again and that's what I
[15:16] said we'll get into that word brother
[15:17] branham will cover he says I can
[15:19] conclusively prove that you're born
[15:20] again and then baptized into the body
[15:23] well that's exactly right but that
[15:26] sounds odd doesn't it sounds like it
[15:29] can't be but let's wait and see that
[15:31] we'll get to the things of
[15:33] avoids doing because a you know some
[15:35] more have said some have said something
[15:37] about that so I see that it it's a
[15:39] valuable point but to feel listen that's
[15:42] what I'm trying to get you to see now
[15:44] you're born again at faith and then each
[15:49] one of these virtues is baptized into
[15:52] you by an addition of the Word of God
[15:56] being revealed until it comes out to the
[16:00] headstone all right and see when it
[16:03] comes out to that then it comes to the
[16:05] basis of where we need to be because
[16:08] that headstone was rejected back under
[16:11] what is promised to come in the end time
[16:13] all right now then you say well what is
[16:17] the headstones of the church let's wait
[16:19] till we get it because if I'll say it
[16:21] like this or you can listen if the new
[16:25] birth faith is the foundation would not
[16:30] that be as the Prophet said that there
[16:32] are all the same material would not the
[16:36] headstone be the same thing as the
[16:37] cornerstone is that not according to
[16:39] scripture that he's ahead of the corner
[16:42] see it's the same thing it's the same
[16:45] material you don't take one material and
[16:48] vulcanize it to another one you can't do
[16:50] that it's got to be the same material
[16:53] all right so faith and then coming to
[16:57] the headstone would that not be the
[16:59] revealed Word of God I'm just asking you
[17:02] sensibly to think if the cornerstone are
[17:06] the the foundation is the word revealed
[17:10] to you and you tell me what it would be
[17:14] outside of that I'm welcome to you to
[17:17] tell me to come and tell me you're
[17:20] duty-bound to come and tell me if you
[17:22] don't agree with that point I'm not
[17:24] trying to get somebody to agree I'm
[17:25] trying to get you to listen to what the
[17:26] prophets say it then that's that between
[17:28] you and God and I can't reveal it the
[17:32] Prophet can't reveal it you can only
[17:34] speak on it alright but if it's the same
[17:37] material then faith being the foundation
[17:41] are a revelation then what would be the
[17:45] headstone
[17:46] it's simple to me now I mean I'm sorry
[17:50] if to say it that way I'm not degrading
[17:52] you I'm just saying this it's simple it
[17:55] has to be simple for me to understand it
[17:57] because I'm simple-minded I'm very
[18:00] simple in that point you say well oh
[18:02] you've got a deep understand no I'm very
[18:04] simple-minded because I take everything
[18:07] simple
[18:08] I love to hear the Prophet explain
[18:10] things and it doesn't bother to me for
[18:13] him to explain it over and over and over
[18:15] how that you're a father you're a son
[18:18] and you're a human and that just makes
[18:23] one of you well you know what I can
[18:27] understand that right that you try to
[18:33] figure it out you can't understand it
[18:35] and I can understand it being the
[18:37] simplicity that he's just one because
[18:42] I'm just one and now we're getting it to
[18:45] where we can follow the line and and be
[18:47] right in line with the whole thing
[18:49] alright but now listen remember it's the
[18:52] same material which means it's the alive
[18:57] word is your faith or new birth so then
[19:01] the headstone would have to be what the
[19:04] alive word see that's where I came up to
[19:08] the virtue have come up to to love their
[19:11] Sunday and just stopped it off because I
[19:14] knew I couldn't continue to bring the
[19:16] rest of the message you remember I told
[19:17] you keep the notes because we wouldn't
[19:20] go and get high void on well that's what
[19:24] I'm wanting you to do see the alive word
[19:30] the word made alive in you was what
[19:33] Jesus was trying to do to the disciples
[19:36] he planted that word into those
[19:40] disciples then the Holy Ghost came under
[19:43] their Pentecost and made that word alive
[19:47] right and there was the new birth the
[19:53] alive word what is the new birth to
[19:55] never individual the alive word yeah but
[19:59] I've done this
[20:00] shouting I cried oh you're not talking
[20:02] about the new birth I'm talking about
[20:03] the new birth I'm talking about those
[20:06] things are just outward manifestations
[20:10] that you're talking about that's why
[20:14] Paul could come along and say have you
[20:16] received the Holy Ghost since you
[20:19] believed
[20:20] well I believed it brother Dale I
[20:22] believed it and I accepted Jesus Christ
[20:25] my say Amen but have you received the
[20:27] Holy Ghost since you believe brother
[20:31] Brennan says saying having previously
[20:33] believed
[20:34] do you now have the baptism of the Holy
[20:36] Ghost but see if you don't like for me
[20:41] to talk about the baptism in the Holy
[20:42] Ghost you know what I'm gonna tell you
[20:44] you don't have it that's as simple as I
[20:47] can put it I don't have to be
[20:50] interpreted it's just truth that's what
[20:54] I said I love to hear someone talking
[20:56] about their experience of the new birth
[20:59] I believe in shouting I believe in
[21:02] emotions I believe in all form of of and
[21:07] as I gave you through that in the series
[21:09] brother Brennan said a dead baby will
[21:11] work you know this is a dead Oh what
[21:17] we're just dead up at Lulla
[21:19] I don't agree with that because as long
[21:22] as the live words here then God is here
[21:25] now if the live word ain't here guard
[21:27] ain't here we need to go somewheres else
[21:30] that's as good as I can put it we all
[21:32] need to leave go somewhere else if it's
[21:34] not the alive word well see I can't
[21:37] depend on nothing but the alive work
[21:39] yeah but we just don't shout we don't do
[21:42] that I'll say it and you can take what
[21:44] you want to about it like I said well
[21:48] what's that another one you said yet
[21:55] they're really they're emotional over
[21:57] here uh-huh but remember what the
[22:01] prophets say what did he say he said
[22:06] just remember it don't matter how high
[22:08] you jump
[22:09] who said you gotta walk straight you
[22:11] come down
[22:14] right you said with it now we go down
[22:18] here and we've got the word well that
[22:21] can kill you too cause the letter kill
[22:25] it and the spirit giveth life so let's
[22:27] get in the middle somewhere and have a
[22:29] wonderful time about what luck God is
[22:32] revealing to us but always remember one
[22:35] time it's the word first then your
[22:41] emotions because emotions proceeding are
[22:44] coming before the word then how do you
[22:46] know where the words right or not what
[22:49] we was going over to a certain church
[22:51] years ago and his brother said and he
[22:53] said brother mote said he's coming over
[22:55] that he's gonna preach farce and he said
[23:00] means to call this brother other brother
[23:02] tonight said he's coming on Friday night
[23:05] no he said brother loads coming on
[23:07] Friday night and said this brother is
[23:08] coming on Saturday night and then it
[23:11] kind of you know because he knew the
[23:14] situation he was in one was a great
[23:17] emotional form of a person
[23:19] the other one was brother Moke under you
[23:21] know like me kind of dry hide I guess
[23:22] you'd call it you do what you want to
[23:24] but anyhow he having it he said a
[23:29] brother boats gonna be here and he'll
[23:33] tell us what to do which said brother
[23:35] so-and-so be will be shouting he said
[23:37] well we'll know what shout about the
[23:41] brother motor tell us what shout about
[23:42] so didn't we shout well that's what
[23:44] they've done man
[23:46] and one lady one lady done a good two
[23:50] step for the longest huh I thought
[23:52] that's pretty good that's you she had
[23:54] her ourselves just right but anyhow I'm
[23:57] making like just being me and listen
[24:01] what is then we come through the virtues
[24:05] and are covering each one of them there
[24:08] this past Sunday afternoon especially at
[24:10] that point all right
[24:12] I mean dispatch winds team all right we
[24:16] were covering the virtues how the
[24:18] Prophet was covering each one of them
[24:20] and showing and I remember what we gave
[24:23] you we gave you the death
[24:25] nation the Prophet gave of the virtues
[24:28] because the the depth definition in
[24:32] Webster is is not the same as the
[24:36] Prophet gave it maybe part of it
[24:38] what the Prophet would say you know said
[24:40] now this this virtue said it's it's not
[24:43] just being a virgin said not in this
[24:47] case well I mean he believed in being
[24:51] that and been straight right well what
[24:54] was his point this has a different form
[24:57] of meaning and he said it means to be
[25:00] strength right instead of just being
[25:05] chaste to T or this that or the other
[25:07] body it means to be strength all right
[25:11] then we went over just giving you a
[25:13] couple of minutes to see if so some of
[25:16] these others were what we're doing that
[25:19] we went over to like patience and then
[25:24] you know temperance and remember we got
[25:29] into temperance well that's a good one
[25:32] cuz run around said now that's not not
[25:35] the factor drinking alcohol you know
[25:39] that's what Webster give you the
[25:40] definition of temperance he's not to
[25:42] drink an alcohol see now why is he
[25:45] saying these things like it's not tasty
[25:48] and it's not just like that of being
[25:53] temperance of the definition of the word
[25:57] because he's given you the Bible
[25:59] definition he's giving you the Holy
[26:02] Ghost definition of the virtues all
[26:06] right and the Holy Ghost definition come
[26:09] on it's like I said well what are we
[26:12] doing see as dumb as I am I can see the
[26:18] prophet standing there looking and he
[26:19] said I don't have to cover virtue the
[26:23] way that Webster says Webster I'll tell
[26:28] you know it's virginity y'all right come
[26:30] on
[26:30] he said another word is he sayin I don't
[26:33] have to cover that you know why cuz it's
[26:35] supposed to be Christians
[26:38] there's not supposed to be they have to
[26:41] run the definition of virtue in the
[26:44] natural lineage of the thing of the
[26:46] world or what it means we shouldn't have
[26:50] that to start with and temperance what
[26:54] we shouldn't have that to start with we
[26:58] shouldn't have to be told about the
[27:00] temper you know it's a prophecy said an
[27:05] uncontrollable temper whatever those
[27:07] Christians never brought it down we
[27:08] don't have a temper well watch your face
[27:12] and get rid come on don't play woman the
[27:17] eyes don't play with you we just talk
[27:19] plain you know you tell me so I don't
[27:22] have no problems well I just tell you
[27:25] right up front you're a liar
[27:26] is that enough is that plenty enough to
[27:31] understand it you tell me you don't have
[27:33] no troubles within they something wrong
[27:35] with you pray for me
[27:37] now that's the best way I can say it
[27:39] because I know what happened with me
[27:42] because I thought the Prophet was the
[27:44] one to tell us he said when you get born
[27:46] again the devil will point ever gun he's
[27:50] God at you is that right
[27:55] whatever temptation ever trial
[27:57] everything's gonna be there you ever
[27:59] brother dealer I'm a Christian I'm not
[28:01] more I'm not that way I know how no no
[28:04] trials are troubled you're louder that's
[28:07] the best way to say it if you'd ask the
[28:09] Lord Jesus about it that's brother
[28:10] branham about the Lord Jesus did your
[28:15] prophet say that Jesus was tempted with
[28:20] women over brother Dale you're not
[28:25] bringing that out your prophet said it
[28:31] he just didn't yield to the temptation
[28:34] right nothing wrong with temptation long
[28:39] as you don't yield to temptation is a
[28:42] part of life you know you can't be human
[28:45] beings without things how about being a
[28:49] husband and wife and
[28:51] and having children that wouldn't work
[28:52] out too good if you didn't I know okay
[28:55] now why don't we leave that now listen
[29:00] then as I said we were covering the
[29:06] virtues and what each one of them were
[29:09] and went through that Wednesday night
[29:12] covering what those virtues were by the
[29:15] Prophet know now for me and you but by
[29:18] the Prophet all right then coming up -
[29:21] and I spent just a little bit of time
[29:23] whenever we clipped it to the to the
[29:26] capstone are the love and I've wondered
[29:30] if I went back listening to the tape you
[29:32] know and I wonder did you listen to what
[29:35] I was trying to explain maybe you don't
[29:40] pay much attention to certain ways or
[29:42] things but to me it's just part of my
[29:44] nature to do brother Brennan spent a lot
[29:48] of time on faith virtue knowledge
[29:51] temperance patience decent amount of
[29:56] godliness but when he gets brotherly
[30:01] kindness very little it's sad now he's a
[30:05] few pages in the book you read very
[30:09] little it said when it comes to love I
[30:15] know we're ministers and we don't work
[30:19] out but a lot of times I agree with you
[30:21] that we ought to take the end of the
[30:23] sermon first and preach it and then
[30:25] preach the first of the sermon lysed
[30:27] and I agree that that would probably be
[30:30] better to make to where you could
[30:32] understand but it don't work that away
[30:35] you know you understand what I'm saying
[30:37] the Prophet spent a whole lot of time
[30:39] here but yet when he gets over here he's
[30:42] running out of time
[30:43] yes we know that but you know what he
[30:47] wouldn't ever know to good at running
[30:48] out of time right he just kept on going
[30:51] specialist Tabernacle and hitting
[30:54] divider didn't bother him to go another
[30:56] hour so on something did you listen to
[30:59] think about what I'm saying see if the
[31:02] time you come from faith virtue or
[31:03] knowledge temperance patience
[31:05] godless brotherly kindness you know
[31:11] you're coming up the pyramid you know
[31:13] you're coming up the stature of a
[31:15] perfect man you know you don't shouldn't
[31:17] have to say a lot about the other things
[31:19] because you ought to know you're to know
[31:23] that the love of God is in our heart as
[31:26] a Christian world of call on God and
[31:30] thank him for the fact that the way the
[31:32] Prophet would express it to us within
[31:34] come to the point of telling us about
[31:36] love and is that cor said the headstone
[31:39] was rejected right he said it hadn't
[31:45] come yet well that was back in 62 he
[31:53] said it hadn't come yet well and then he
[31:57] talks about the capstone of love now
[32:03] I'll repeat the wording again if the
[32:08] foundation is the revealed word would
[32:13] not the headstone be the revealed word I
[32:17] mean that shouldn't take a lot to have
[32:20] us to understand you no matter what you
[32:23] take it in line of what you're putting
[32:25] it you know what I've got to have we're
[32:27] gonna respect this we for whatever
[32:29] you're putting it I think I ain't
[32:31] dealing with that I'm dealing with what
[32:33] it is right you say well I'm expecting
[32:39] this all right
[32:41] come on get where I'm talking about
[32:43] because I'm expecting to he said brother
[32:47] day we've never heard yeah you've heard
[32:49] me over and over say what the Prophet
[32:51] said he said one day God will fill this
[32:54] church with his fullness of his being
[32:57] take us in the rapture we don't have to
[33:02] worry about what it is he's already told
[33:03] us he said it would take such a baptism
[33:09] of the Holy Ghost said it would fill
[33:11] every fiber of our being
[33:15] he said brother Taylor you mean you're
[33:17] looking for that
[33:18] yes I have a right to look at it because
[33:23] it's mine
[33:24] it's for me I have a right to believe it
[33:30] he spoke it to me alright Church then
[33:39] what about it what would be the capstone
[33:45] if the cornerstone is faith well now you
[33:53] can't make the cornerstone faith and
[33:55] then the headstone something different
[33:57] right no if that's what you think then
[34:00] you're not in them you're not in the
[34:02] channel I'm talking in because I don't
[34:04] believe that never have I'll always
[34:06] believe one thing this is the one thing
[34:08] I believe in I'm gonna say it and then
[34:10] we'll talk about it a little bit your
[34:13] prophet come and brought a message he
[34:16] started back there in the 40s and he was
[34:21] trying to preach the things that God was
[34:25] revealing to him right he gets over to
[34:31] the stature of a perfect man in 62 and
[34:34] he said 30 years or 33 something like
[34:37] he'd been preaching that well you know
[34:43] if it took in 30 years to preach it
[34:45] evidently we didn't know it we didn't
[34:51] accept it
[34:52] show me the Pentecostals accepted his
[34:55] message what I talking to you about the
[34:58] other day you say well this and that the
[35:00] other Billy Graham brought around and
[35:01] said nobody could touch Billy Graham in
[35:03] the message he had to preach of
[35:05] salvation but he didn't have a message
[35:09] he didn't have a message like this
[35:11] prophet had he come with the Word of God
[35:14] and laid it out on the table in front of
[35:17] mankind and said all right now you come
[35:19] and show me where I'm wrong
[35:25] he had the message of Malacca forward
[35:27] right so then all the way up through
[35:32] there he was trying to preach go back to
[35:34] Intervale 56 elected Intervale and
[35:38] listen to him talk about a living moving
[35:41] instrumentality of a human being that
[35:45] had come to a position to walk in Christ
[35:47] and come all the way up to the message
[35:50] listening to his growth development sure
[35:54] he'll get on over to Locke mm maybe I
[35:59] miss it but it would be someone but he
[36:00] says you must be born again and you know
[36:04] we start saying things that are odd to
[36:06] people he starts talking about that you
[36:12] must be born again and then baptized
[36:14] into the body and we think he's all
[36:17] messed up he starts bringing things
[36:24] closer and closer and when he gets up
[36:27] for like stature of perfect land look
[36:29] what he was doing look where he stood he
[36:33] said no not knowing this the other day
[36:36] they got this up in the woods up there
[36:38] about this drawing how this feed into
[36:41] what I was going to preach so he was
[36:43] already preaching it listen he was
[36:45] already preaching the statue of a
[36:47] perfect man he just didn't how the tying
[36:49] together of all the scriptures and the
[36:51] things then as it began to tie together
[36:54] he brought it on out further and further
[36:57] until it made it to the people when
[37:00] listening to the statue of a perfect man
[37:01] you know what I'm talking about true the
[37:03] doctrine is especially still in the
[37:05] foreign fields that you don't have the
[37:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:09] until you get all these virtues you're
[37:14] not born again the doctrine it until you
[37:16] get all them virtues I can't say that
[37:22] but if you wait until you get all of
[37:24] them you're gonna be waiting and die
[37:27] come on that's why I told you before you
[37:30] can lock it or what and I believe God
[37:33] spoke to me and said most of the people
[37:35] of this message even born-again
[37:37] Christians are going dying go
[37:39] a grave because they can't take what the
[37:41] prophets say whether you like that or
[37:44] not that's no business to me I just tell
[37:46] you what he say it and that's 40 some
[37:52] years ago because what I saw back then
[37:55] is what I see now people that are
[37:57] sitting dull and no wonder the people
[37:59] think that we're dead at Lully you said
[38:01] so Dryden uh don't know it's like you're
[38:06] scared it's like you're afraid of what
[38:09] I'm saying like if you think that I'm
[38:11] trying to lead you wrong well if that's
[38:18] what you think you need to go somewheres
[38:19] else come on church ain't no problem do
[38:24] you think that I'm trying to scare you
[38:26] into do know I'm trying my best to
[38:28] repeatedly we preach over and over and
[38:31] over to try to get us to see the truth
[38:33] of the message of the hour that profit
[38:37] bringing that message that it began to
[38:39] progress more and more and more and more
[38:42] that he comes up to the statue of a
[38:44] perfect man
[38:45] then he gets up to let's say one rot for
[38:49] the seals mmm
[38:50] services it's the time now there's a
[38:52] department you know one of them stayed
[38:55] in one way one in the other but
[38:56] surgeries it's the time and he starts
[38:59] talking about the great things that are
[39:04] laying just ahead cuz remember that was
[39:09] the visions and things when he was to go
[39:11] west and connect with the Angels and
[39:13] come back and the thing was being
[39:15] brought into that on and he's he did he
[39:19] begin to speak of things he began to say
[39:24] it like this he'd say serves is this the
[39:28] time as it is those sunders wants to cap
[39:35] off the church you remember that first
[39:39] what time it is these those thunders
[39:44] there to cap off the church the things
[39:47] that we didn't don't know if I'd heard
[39:49] he begin to see there was things he
[39:52] didn't know
[39:52] he preached the seals in what was it 60
[39:56] somewhere right in there where he
[39:58] preached to see what you remembered he
[39:59] preached it like one just preached like
[40:02] real fights through it somewhere right
[40:04] in there is he preached that and you
[40:07] still holding it to white horse rider
[40:08] was the Holy Ghost right but then you
[40:15] begin to see it fangs unveil further and
[40:18] further on into the message then you'd
[40:25] say if what you want to but I'm gonna
[40:26] say it this way
[40:27] and mean it he began to grow into the
[40:31] stature of a perfect man I believe that
[40:36] I believe he began to grow but he was a
[40:41] prophet prophets has to grow especially
[40:44] this prophet did he get into the statue
[40:48] of perfect man and say Lord fill me up
[40:50] these are the things God expects us to
[40:53] add didn't you read the statue of a
[40:55] perfect man okay now listen
[41:01] did he get over into the message of the
[41:06] statue of a perfect man and he says this
[41:10] now I'm not asking them to pull them up
[41:12] because I don't know whether they've got
[41:14] him if they have it'll be number one if
[41:15] you can pull it up if not then we'll
[41:17] just read it I passed out and had
[41:20] Terrence now anybody you still got him

[41:35] parks okay so then you you get one of
[41:38] them if you don't we'll make you a copy
[41:39] on the statue of a perfect man
[41:42] paragraph 328 building this monument
[41:46] building this statue see it starts off
[41:50] with the foundation stone faith virtue
[41:52] and knowledge temperance patience
[41:54] godliness brotherly kindness and now
[41:57] what does it do then they're waiting for
[41:59] the headstone which is love for God is
[42:02] love
[42:05] and he controlled and he is the strip
[42:08] that they were one of these things right
[42:10] yes sir right in here right in here see
[42:16] I got in between all these works in here
[42:20] now what's he got in between the words
[42:24] the Holy Spirit right in between this
[42:28] and this between the body and the head
[42:31] he's got the Holy Spirit look what he
[42:34] says not in between these works and here
[42:37] and you're these little waves now
[42:40] that'll go with sister
[42:43] scheppers bless me miss names if you'll
[42:46] get into that but a little waves come
[42:49] what is that now listen to Al and the
[42:57] Holy Ghost coming down through Christ
[42:59] the Holy Ghost coming down through
[43:05] Christ well that's exactly what he's got
[43:14] he's got love coming down through the
[43:17] Holy Spirit which this is Christ right
[43:22] okay now listen the Holy Spirit is above
[43:26] all this welding this together
[43:30] there's he headstone building what a
[43:33] perfect search for the capstone to cap
[43:35] it off no now listen to what he's saying
[43:42] what it's been done again it's
[43:45] manifested through seven Church ages and
[43:48] seven church messengers now remember
[43:51] from the Chrysler mystery there's a
[43:52] statement in there to where he says you
[43:55] know as the individual grows so does the
[43:59] church you remember that you remember
[44:02] reading that the Statue of a perfect man
[44:04] as the church come up and done and
[44:06] progressed through the ages the
[44:08] individual comes up so the church comes
[44:11] up the same way all right what faith
[44:13] virtue or knowledge temperance places to
[44:15] Wesley Luther West and all of the time
[44:17] it
[44:18] comes up the church comes up the same
[44:20] way as the individuals what through the
[44:23] revealed word right through the revealed
[44:28] word he goes on through paragraph 358
[44:34] and we'll go down to 360 save time so
[44:37] when you surrender your complete being
[44:41] now listen to it then the Holy Spirit
[44:44] just pours through you in these virtues
[44:47] then you're a living tabernacle then
[44:50] people look out and say that's a man
[44:53] full of virtue or knowledge he believes
[44:55] the word temperance patience godliness
[44:56] brotherly kindness full of the love and
[44:59] of the Holy Ghost see there he is
[45:02] walking around what is it a stature that
[45:04] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[45:07] a Christian there is a man or a woman
[45:09] who who knows what they're talking about
[45:12] you never seen a kinder sweeter a godly
[45:15] or person you're sealed seal shows on
[45:19] both sides whether you're going or
[45:21] coming you see the seals just the sign
[45:23] there you are see when a man or woman
[45:26] possesses this then the capstone comes
[45:29] down and seals them into the kingdom of
[45:32] God which is the Holy Ghost all right
[45:35] when the headstone unites with the body
[45:38] it will seal all the whole thing
[45:40] together and you remember how that we've
[45:44] taught it many many years just a little
[45:47] point for you to understand it don't
[45:48] mean nothing maybe to you but it sure
[45:51] does to me if you drop that headstone
[45:54] down it ain't gonna fit at the top of
[45:56] that pyramid so just leave it where it's
[45:59] at that's what he's saying the Holy
[46:01] Ghost coming down through Christ
[46:04] leaving worse at if you drop it down
[46:07] look what you got well don't you just
[46:11] fill in the side and let him seal the
[46:16] whole thing right that is the body of
[46:22] Christ
[46:23] that's the individual of the statue of a
[46:26] perfect man well all of those things
[46:29] sealed in and that is the body of Christ
[46:32] bust through the church ages to bring it
[46:36] all to the correct place right bless me
[46:42] mister items first foundationally is
[46:47] faith second add to your faith virtue to
[46:51] divert your knowledge to your knowledge
[46:53] temperance from temperance patience to
[46:56] patience godliness and from God in this
[46:58] brotherly love brotherly kindness and
[47:01] then to love being the capstone seven of
[47:05] those things seven church agency and
[47:08] seven stars of this church ages you know
[47:11] the messengers and all of it is tempered
[47:14] together by the Holy Ghost
[47:17] listen now that's what it takes to
[47:21] become a servant of Christ Christ build
[47:24] his church in seven Church ages his
[47:26] bride a person a woman Church seven
[47:29] Church ages constitutes and make the
[47:32] bride some out of this I'm out of that
[47:34] some of that altogether shaping it up to
[47:36] period now you're listening
[47:42] what is the cornerstone they remember
[47:47] that we used to talk with that in the
[47:49] denominations how that the cornerstone
[47:52] was Jesus Christ standing there but it
[47:55] becomes a full headstone later on
[47:58] because we could even study that because
[48:00] it says that the cornerstone has to
[48:03] become the head of the corner all right
[48:05] it's got to go all over and be the same
[48:07] stone the cornerstone and the headstones
[48:10] the same stone is this the position of
[48:13] which the stone is in you know the
[48:17] headstone and the cornerstone take your
[48:19] your drawing you look at the headstone
[48:23] then you take your drawing and you do
[48:25] that Rutter and that cornerstone is
[48:27] exactly the same as I write the
[48:32] cornerstone is the headstone it's just
[48:35] according to the manifestation it was a
[48:37] cornerstone the Prophet said in the
[48:39] church unless see if I can get it he
[48:42] said in the full church it'll be the
[48:45] headstone
[48:46] believe that's ask perforation it was
[48:48] close
[48:49] it'd be the full church alright what's
[48:53] the full church you and I the end of all
[48:55] things the bride of Jesus Christ in the
[48:57] full church the kingdom that's the point
[49:01] we're at where we're at now walking in
[49:06] these things and thinking about it but
[49:10] then I'm gonna just drop it and I'm
[49:12] gonna leave this with you cuz this part
[49:15] I don't have a quote that tells you the
[49:21] Prophet said so and so verbatim I can
[49:25] give you a lot of all things but any
[49:27] word about it I'm just gonna tell you go
[49:31] see to me if the cornerstone and the
[49:34] headstone is the same stone if the
[49:37] entire pyramid is the same material and
[49:39] if it all is the revealing of the Word
[49:42] of God no that's what I believe I
[49:46] believe it's the revealing of the Word
[49:48] of God faith is a revelation of Jesus
[49:52] Christ but in the full church it'll be
[49:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ a mystery
[49:57] where brother Brian said how is it let's
[49:59] see if I can get it he said in other
[50:02] words it's 33 some across some history
[50:06] but he says what is the new birth he
[50:11] said it's a revelation Jesus Christ
[50:12] personally to you but right above there
[50:15] he covers how that the word is so and so
[50:17] and the word of it and the word in the
[50:20] fullness is in the bride now here's
[50:23] where we're at see that's why we die
[50:25] when we come forth with the word we die
[50:28] if we don't accept something and go on
[50:31] go see you say I don't see it I know
[50:37] I've made you upset at me for saying it
[50:39] so go ahead get upset I'll tell you want
[50:44] you bring the book of Acts up here and
[50:47] put us back dar and let's see what they
[50:49] do you say in the book of life that they
[50:54] had bring them down here where they got
[50:56] ten thousand demons to fight where they
[50:59] got two
[51:00] thousand thousand demons to fight
[51:02] against when they only had the Pharisees
[51:04] and Sadducees and the hero D under which
[51:07] one bring them down here they'll be glad
[51:13] to go back where they were to giving
[51:15] their life
[51:19] did your prophet say the church always
[51:24] does better under what persecution we'd
[51:31] be better off where we were being
[51:32] persecuted I'll never form at least we
[51:35] would be trying but instead we just die
[51:40] cuz we don't see it maybe you don't know
[51:50] what you're looking for mm-hmm okay
[51:56] hey brother though then give us your
[52:01] statement then Oh what you think the
[52:05] headstone really is because I believe
[52:10] this ever since I come in the message
[52:12] and begin to study it if the cornerstone
[52:18] is the revealed word the headstone will
[52:21] be the revealed word that's where I
[52:23] stand all right
[52:27] he stood during 62 preaching the statue
[52:32] of perfect man laying it perfectly in
[52:37] order and he says she's waiting on the
[52:40] headstone what would be the headstone to
[52:47] the church well
[52:54] this brother so-and-so he'll come out
[52:56] and walk out here and will be or it's
[52:58] just so here or set over to ours he's
[53:00] looking for people
[53:04] what is the headstone for the church did
[53:11] not the prophet sister Shepherds dream
[53:13] with off the top look down in the
[53:18] pyramid and what do you see no right but
[53:26] he saw the seven seals you had to go
[53:28] west and come back now here's what's
[53:32] gonna flop hard and if you're thinking
[53:35] brother branham said in Daniels 70 week
[53:41] message if you don't understand Daniel
[53:44] 70 weeks you can not understand the
[53:47] seals the plagues the vowels of trumpets
[53:50] in time but nobody wants to know
[53:52] anything about Daniel 70 weeks remember
[53:56] Daniel 70 weeks was preached before the
[53:57] seals statue a perfect man is preached
[54:01] before the seal
[54:04] okay what do you think is the headstone
[54:08] brother there I believe it's those seven
[54:10] seals you tell me what it would be those
[54:16] seven seals comes off the entire body of
[54:20] Christ
[54:20] I thought the seven seals was the plan
[54:24] of redemption and we're wrong there I
[54:27] thought that's what the prophets said
[54:28] that it was the plan of redemption we'll
[54:32] see then brother then what do you do
[54:33] then what are you saying I'm saying if
[54:35] we don't understand the foundation back
[54:39] here and walk from faith virtue or
[54:42] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[54:44] brotherly kindness coming up to the
[54:47] headstone then when the headstone come
[54:49] we wouldn't know nothing about it and
[54:50] that's where most people are because
[54:52] they know nothing about it they reject
[54:57] the seals oh they'll follow it one two
[55:02] three four five maybe maybe in Flour it
[55:07] through the sixth seal
[55:09] but then they get to the seventh and
[55:13] miss the very little things and I'm just
[55:16] saying there's come on musician miss the
[55:22] simple little fine little random what is
[55:26] the Seventh Seal he said it's the coming
[55:28] of the Lord
[55:30] now whatever that consists of ain't got
[55:33] to do with it do you understand me what
[55:40] that consists of is not up to me it's up
[55:42] to God what is the Seventh Seal the
[55:46] coming of the Lord the revealing of his
[55:52] word
[55:52] what is the seven seals the complete
[55:56] plan of salvation the revealing of his
[56:03] word I've taught that now for fifty
[56:04] almost fifty years and I believe it more
[56:07] today than I did when I started and how
[56:12] many of you to remember the first sermon
[56:13] the priests you ever remember the first
[56:20] sermon of priests there's an Athens
[56:23] Georgia brother learning in was probably
[56:26] the earth I preached what that the bride
[56:33] of Jesus Christ according to the Prophet
[56:37] and I read it and I'll be glad to read
[56:39] it to you again that the Son of Man the
[56:48] revealed word the bride of Jesus Christ
[56:52] will be the son of man brother Branham
[56:55] was not the son of man I stand the same
[56:58] way I stood that day there and I stood
[57:01] for 30 minutes or more pounding up on
[57:03] the basis of saying hey wait a minute
[57:05] now brother Branham is a son of man the
[57:08] Lord Jesus is the Son of man but when
[57:10] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[57:13] dwell into the bride which would put it
[57:15] into brother Branham first and be able
[57:18] to bring it out through him through the
[57:21] teaching of the word
[57:22] in God revealing it to you and I and
[57:24] would bring us all into it
[57:25] and bring the fullness of the Godhead
[57:27] bodily into the Browder Jesus Christ I
[57:30] stand the same time do you think people
[57:35] want to hear it I went to one church
[57:41] outside of this message I mean outside
[57:43] of this year I went to one church and
[57:45] preached on the seals only got four I'm
[57:50] gonna go no father see none listen if
[58:01] your prophets right that's for you then
[58:06] he says you can't understand the seals
[58:09] until you understand Daniel seventy
[58:11] weeks now words the ministry preaching
[58:18] on the Daniel seventy weeks they're
[58:25] scared of it
[58:26] afraid of it they afraid to approach it
[58:28] oh they do a lot of things yell then
[58:34] they make it look good boy let's see you
[58:39] bring it from Daniel 70 weeks before he
[58:41] said that he said you don't understand
[58:44] the seal sometimes do you understand
[58:48] that you see you say well brother Dale
[58:54] what is the headstone to the church the
[58:56] revealing of God's Word and the
[58:58] revealing of God's Word is the revealing
[59:01] of those seven seals which is the
[59:04] complete plan of redemption given to the
[59:08] bride of Jesus Christ the one thing that
[59:12] was left out in the finishing of the
[59:15] Bible Jesus came and stood there in his
[59:19] weeks time I said it right weeks time or
[59:22] highs and stood and preached to the Jews
[59:24] and told them who was to be walking
[59:29] where the the headstone and what it was
[59:31] and they rejected it the
[59:35] now bride has rejected the teaching of
[59:41] the seals the afraid of it
[59:48] afraid of Daniel seventy weeks now this
[59:56] is one you love in a message called the
[1:00:00] seals run around and preached a message
[1:00:05] and later came back to that and this is
[1:00:09] what he said he said marriage and
[1:00:11] divorce was revealed in the seals the
[1:00:14] Moriah marriage and divorce he said was
[1:00:18] revealed in the seals but worst people
[1:00:22] want to hear about marriage and divorce
[1:00:24] now they do they'd rather go on and take
[1:00:28] their changes upon anything they can
[1:00:30] place it instead of sitting down talking
[1:00:33] about it and letting it be put together
[1:00:39] from the beginning to the end why don't
[1:00:46] we write we're afraid of the thing that
[1:00:52] has come to set us free which is the
[1:00:55] reveal Word of God
[1:01:03] think of these times less tan well we
[1:01:07] got bread i apprec
[1:01:19] every father i apprec

[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:18] Wow
[1:02:23] probably
[1:02:27] other apostles prophets evangelists
[1:02:31] pastors date further perfective are
[1:02:33] bringing these things into the body
[1:02:35] well if we turn that down we're not God
[1:02:40] Kenny you can't go before God and say I
[1:02:43] try to do everything
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:48] that's not trying to make nothing out of
[1:02:49] anybody go there in five minutes I'll
[1:02:52] listen to anybody that probably takes
[1:02:56] and listen and do it I don't listen to
[1:02:59] nobody else unless something comes along
[1:03:01] that's valuable for me here something
[1:03:05] I'm concerned about you I'll listen to a
[1:03:08] brother preach on him to be able to say
[1:03:10] I heard that myself
[1:03:14] miss Eleanor bitching put in a lot of
[1:03:18] the five four minutes or I wouldn't
[1:03:19] truck
[1:03:25] that's no problem
[1:03:27] the Bible says they have ministers of
[1:03:32] righteousness Satan has
[1:03:39] not ball givers they got away from that
[1:03:43] preaching the higher to dress the
[1:03:44] clothes
[1:03:49] got down to getting these little bitty
[1:03:51] things I'm saying now what the profit
[1:03:55] was wrong well how can you trust
[1:03:59] anything that was wrong
[1:04:02] the jerk I am NOT Sun to try to declare
[1:04:06] the gospel unto you
[1:04:08] when they said let's boot on the
[1:04:11] internet I said no I said I will get in
[1:04:14] arguments and I'm not gonna argue with
[1:04:16] nobody
[1:04:18] it's not will get it just loads of junk
[1:04:22] coming through
[1:04:24] thank God it hadn't come well what do
[1:04:34] you think
[1:04:35] I think God's kept his word
[1:04:40] I think he's gonna bring forth a little
[1:04:43] bride it's gonna be a small bride and
[1:04:46] ain't gonna be worldwide and millions of
[1:04:48] people now and I ain't against
[1:04:50] evangelizing I we send out we go out we
[1:04:53] do so you can't say I'm against it when
[1:04:58] this trait transform
[1:05:06] I believe the headstone was preached by
[1:05:13] the Prophet
[1:05:17] Nate none of us got any ride to go in
[1:05:19] there and try to do anything change
[1:05:21] anything or do any part that's not a
[1:05:23] fivefold ministry if you are a fivefold
[1:05:25] ministry and try that just let it be
[1:05:27] known that I'm saying you're not one of
[1:05:29] them because they're genuine fivefold
[1:05:31] ministry is gonna stay with the problem
[1:05:35] they won't have the province ministry no
[1:05:37] not looking forward to it but they'll
[1:05:40] have what God gives them and they'll
[1:05:44] bring forth the Word of God and God will
[1:05:47] come to that and join himself to that
[1:05:50] word
[1:05:54] you see that's worth it I've always
[1:05:55] tried to get you involved you remember
[1:05:59] years ago when the brother had a dream
[1:06:02] he saw the pillar of fire floating among
[1:06:05] the church
[1:06:08] he would see it now and then then one
[1:06:13] day he said I've got something to say
[1:06:16] well if you'll let me say it I said say
[1:06:18] it he gave him the pulpit he said I
[1:06:23] would stand in the air and said I saw
[1:06:25] the pillar fire was here who brother
[1:06:26] Dalyan but said it went out toward the
[1:06:30] back they meant he didn't say it went
[1:06:32] out the door he said it went out toward
[1:06:34] the back a couple of Ministers from here
[1:06:38] declared that the Holy Ghost was leaving
[1:06:41] us but that pillar of fire was going out
[1:06:45] I said you didn't listen he didn't say
[1:06:47] it without the door he said it went back
[1:06:49] that's what I've always tried to do I
[1:06:51] worked the Holy Ghost is in me that
[1:06:54] teaches me this word were to go back to
