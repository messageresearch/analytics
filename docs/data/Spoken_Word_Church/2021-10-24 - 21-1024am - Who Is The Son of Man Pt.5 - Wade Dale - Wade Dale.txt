========================================

that's why we set we start all of our sunday schools at 9 45 and we finish them at 10 15. i want everybody in this sanctuary by at least 10 16 or 17. doesn't take you but a minute or two maybe 10 20 at the latest some of you have musicians that are in your classes that need to be up here during worship service not come dragging in at 10 30. okay that wasn't ever changed that so you must have changed it see what i mean about iniquity you're going to do what you want to do and also there's been people seeing people sitting in their cars while the service is going on if you're sick that's okay but if you're a kid you need your parents there with you there won't be any kids sitting in cars there won't be any kids roaming around downstairs anymore after today if your kid can't stay awake send them home okay that's what i mean this is these things have never changed sometimes we just forget brother brown says be in this sanctuary 20 minutes before the service starts some of you drag in at 10 30. and we're going in a rapture yeah we're we're getting to adoption yeah we're yeah no but we need to stop it kids don't need to be downstairs without their parents if you're sick that's okay but while this service is going on there shouldn't be no one downstairs at all you should be up here at 10 45 or 10 15. you've had plenty of time to do what you need to do from 9 45 to 10 15. it's more important to be up here man it's more important to be up here not what you're saying downstairs okay so 10 15 i want everybody up here then and be ready ryan did a good job today man what a good job he did one more time take over for brother bob just remember brother bob he sent me a text a few minutes ago his dad his father-in-law's not doing well in his body his mind is okay but he has lou gehrig's disease and some of you don't know what that is but it's the muscles and you have pretty much no control after a little while of yourself and and then the there's no cure but we know one guy that said i'll heal all your diseases so we're going to pray for for our brother that he'll be restored he's got a big family and they're all down there now brother bob's preaching for him so remember bob and and the kids and all down there also brother luis will be speaking for us wednesday night those of you that are going to camp you need to make sure you get everything together ready to go um i'll be up there friday for a little while i'm bringing deanna up friday uh afternoon so uh just do us fine do us well don't get in trouble go up there for one reason that's to praise the lord and to find the will of god for your life amen also next sunday um i'll be at brother mike altis i've been trying to stay home more but brother mike's called two weekends in a row and i talked to dad today he's you know he just had a heart attack he's got bladder stones not kidney stones bladder stones and they're hurting him pretty bad so i'm gonna go preach for him next sunday morning and uh brother aaron will take sunday morning service here brother bob will still be doing sunday school and then brother bob will be doing the afternoon service at two o'clock so just keep that in your prayers pray for me pray for brother mike i don't think they've had service since he's had a heart attack two months ago so the people need they need comfort they need they need they need to see their shepherd back amen all right now let's remember a couple more things november the 6th bible study we got november coming up november the 10th brother marcus becker will be with us november the 14th will be our church dinner we'll only have one service and then you know that the next weekend will be our next week will be thanksgiving and we will not have service on that wednesday night we will have service on that tuesday night all right that's been something we've done for several years so just keep that in your heart and your mind so all mine's clear you ready to hear the word of god you know i was thinking yesterday when i read that quote i'm gonna read it again where brother brown says he's coming in a different way we're gonna talk about a different way but now remember when i made that quote last weekend it maybe seems to stumble you a little bit because you say well we got to learn all this new way no remember jesus came exactly the way the old testament said he was coming he didn't miss it by one scripture right so he came what was in the bible but he didn't come the way they wanted him to come so it's not some new seventh seal revelation we're going to get a new bible we're going to get a new quote we're going to get a new this no it's the same thing that we've read all along it's just going to there's going to be more reveal there's going to be more opened up there's going to be more light and listen there's going to be more power in the word of god as brother bob was preaching on the other night you know we got the mechanics we got all the books and tapes we we listen to them all the time we read them all the time we read the quotes the dynamics is makes that thing go though all right so we got the mechanics and i believe we're heading to the dynamics and i think we got to understand that it's not something that we got to go find it's something you already got inside of you you just got to let that thing out let that thing do what it's supposed to do like ryan said one two three every time god told the king to do so and so and so and so as long as they did it as long as israel did exactly what he said god was blessing them abundantly the first time they turned against him the first time i mean look he told solomon he said solomon as long as you walk in my ways you'll be the wisest man on earth and he was the wisest man on earth until what he let two women bring another god in hello somebody a strange doctrine he let he let two women in and you know what that was his downfall he died right after that so god will bless you as long as you stay in his blessings but you get outside of his blessings then he doesn't have to bless you see if you stay under his blessing he has to bless you but if you get out from under his blessings he don't have to bless you so let's go to john 1 1 continue this series but just keep those things in the heart we're just trying to make everything good right we want to have be a good example to everybody don't think people's watch not watching you watching every move you make all of us so we're supposed to walk right you know what they watched jesus they watched every move you made they called him a wine bibber they called him a uh you know somebody that was hung around prostitutes and sinners and didn't wash his hand when he eat right why do you not watch your your disciples not wash your hands boy sister rachel your mother have a problem with that one sister race was always talking about men don't ever wash their hands the disciples didn't and they ate they lived and survived so john 1 verse 1 let's pray before we get started let's remember i cannot remember his name but they call him tata and that means grandfather in romanian i'm i'm pretty sure but let's remember tata while we're praying amen to heavenly father we pray lord that you just be with us today for this journey that we're on father we're just trying to get rid of all the sin and the weight that so easily besets us that we run this race father and we can run it fast so we can get out of here lord i pray this should be with brother bob today giving the words to speak to the people the lord bless that family and lord be with tantra lord we love him lord with the love of the lord and we pray that you'd raise him up for your honor and glory lord don't let him suffer like that father just be with him he's been your servant for years and years and years and i pray that you were just anoint him father and just be with each one lord is here under the sound of my voice but you'll give us revelation today raise us up higher in you father lord for the ones that don't have you lord we pray that you just fill them with the holy ghost today father that you'll give them lord revelation father we need you more than anything we don't need all this other stuff we need you father we need you to come lord and do the speaking today and you do the hearing father just be with each one bless the ones that are not here there are several on the road doing things lord we pray that you'd bless them be with the ones that are homesick we pray that you'd be with them father as they watch in these a little bride all around the world lord and just take care of each one bless our pastor and keep him strong lord keep going keep just keep going keep making it better and better better lord we love you for all these blessings in jesus name amen who is this son of man john 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john we know that was john the baptist same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light the prophet of god was not that light all the prophets were not that light there's only one light the light the one that said let there be light amen but now we're here to declare him and the prophets are here to declare him right he was not that light but it was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came exactly the way the bible said but he came a different way that's what brother brown said son of man we'll read it and he said this is all going to come a different way why it's going to come not out of the normalcy of religion amen and we'll talk about a body that has prepared me this afternoon but we're going to indict this generation today first you got to do that he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god that's me in you even to them that believes on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and that word same word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord and his blessing to the reading of the word and we'll just kind of review over a little bit today genesis 3 15 says i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed showing that there had to be a natural happening man died in flesh adam and eve they had a fleshly experience amen it didn't kill their soul their soul was eternal their soul was part of that genesis 1 26 ma'am amen all right part of that genesis 1 26 man that soul was eternal couldn't fall listen you can't have god fall god can't fall all right so when he put that inside of adam adam couldn't fall in his soul he could fall in his flesh and in his spirit realm that's where you fall you fall in your spirit realm like i said last sunday you know you look cross-eyed at them if you want to but you don't when you sin out here in the world or do something wrong or or or get condemned that's not in your soul your soul is what's condemning you and if your soul don't condemn you you don't have one in there that will condemn you that's what i'm telling you about this adoption that we're coming to if we don't become more and more aware of what we're doing than not doing then we're not going up that statue of perfect man and you might be just a regular good old christian and that's okay but that's not what our requirement is the requirement of the son of man is to take a body change and you won't take a body change acting like we do me everybody else because we haven't come to that position yet i will put enmity between then the woman and between thy seed and her seed and that shall bruise my head thou shalt bruise his heel showing that the act of redemption has to come if they died in flesh that there's gonna have to be somebody come and bring flesh back become flesh and bring the flesh back up now we know here's adam soul was eternal spirit was given to him by god remember reason consciousness affects the imagination hello all right and then he was given a body in genesis 2 7. and inside of him was a special was a special thing because god wasn't going to create another person he was going to take that person and divide him male and female created he them so there's that part over here he can't change that but when he brought he brought adam first eve was inside of him then eve was taken out of adam and then the spirit of the feminist part of eve was put into her and there she was flesh out of who out of adam out of his side flesh of his flesh bone of his bone all right so now that's the same way now remember when they got separated god knew they were going to fall i was reading this morning in adoption series brother brown started in ephesians talking about foreign knowledge he said that's the reason the lamb had to be slain before the foundation of the world before everything came he knew they were going to fall so he didn't give satan one second of an opportunity to destroy his plan so if we look at the plan of god it is already already set signed and delivered satan can't do anything about it he can play all he wants to but god's already if your name's on the lounge book of life you're already sitting in heavenly places amen and you can't be lost praise god so adam was already saved before he got here in the mind of god as brother bob was talking about in the mind of god you're saved when you were born of your flesh mom and daddy you weren't because the bible said not of the will of the flesh not of the will of the of this body that's here but of what but of god we're born from above and truly if jesus could live in human flesh and be the be the absolute headstone and now he lives inside of me and you that's the whole point of this whole thing and he now transferred all that inside of you now not all of it he was the fullness of the godhead bodily but you get your part right but see there by foreign knowledge god knew what part you wanted and there is your journey there's the foreknowledge of god setting your destiny by what he saw that you wanted and didn't want amen so listen yes obviously god is all-knowing and he's already got this thing set but it's only set by the life he saw you live so you have a lot to do with this amen why are y'all so quiet this morning okay if the ball game you wouldn't be deuteronomy 18 15 says the lord thy god shall raise up to the unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him he shall hearken so now this is another promise because we're going to go back and we're going to see jesus we're going to walk him through the old testament this afternoon but this morning we're going to kind of go back and get a background listen because i want you to understand why we need the revelation of the son of man listen if you've been in this message any time in your life you've heard of the son of man you've heard son of man son of man son of man this is the son of man message brother bradham talks about the son of man this son of man that jesus called himself the son of man so there must be something about this son of man amen and there must be something about him that a lot of people don't understand i'm talking about 99.9 of the people in the world do not understand who the son of man is they make him a second person of the trinity they don't baptize in his name the very salvation that he came to give so the whole part that's why brother branham had to come and restore the son of god revelation first because it got lost but then the son of man revelation is like he said it's something different jesus was a different individual yet he was human yet he ate every day yet he walked the road rose of galilee yet he talked to the people he healed the sick he raised the dead he did everything that he said he was going to do and they killed him for it that's what they killed him for they killed him for saying he was god they didn't kill him for all the other things they didn't hate brother branham while he was while he was on his road around in different communities and healing the sick and raising their dead the pastors loved him he was just filling churches full there was no message church back then remember he said you get saved he said go to find you some full gospel church or he said you go back and tell your people in your church see he didn't he couldn't there's nowhere he could send them but see that was under the son of god revelation like we were talking about last sunday because the son of god revelation got them saved got them saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost all right made him live a better life and we'll read that right here in just a second but now matthew 16 the word don't need to read that because jesus you know what he's saying jesus said who do men say that i the son of man am and they told him who the son of god was he said i'll build my church on that and the gates of hell will not prevail against it all right but now listen if you ever wonder why jesus sat that why he didn't rebuke peter because he didn't answer the question why didn't he say peter that's not what i asked you he didn't he just continued on said okay i'll build my church on that revelation because see being almighty god he knew that they were going to crucify him he knew that they were going to he was going to come back on the day of pentecost as the holy ghost but he also knew being the word he knew that there had to be a group of people way down the line 2 000 years later that was going to get that revelation again and him come back again and get into your human flesh and change your body amen i believe i believe that's what he was if he if he didn't know it you know there's some things that jesus didn't know brother brown said he didn't know anything about it when he was coming or about his second coming so and he said only the father knows that there's some strange things but remember jesus was ever human but he was ever with god amen and we got to see that you say how can we listen we ought to be able to see it more than the whole world sees it we ought to be able to see that and understand how can be ever wit human and ever with god because apart from your birth you came just like jesus did apart from your sex birth you understand what i mean he grew up like a kid he learned by the things he suffered he grew in grace and knowledge he came to a river jordan and he was approved or accepted of of god the holy ghost came down on him on the river jordan and said this is my beloved son and whom i'm pleased to dwell brother brown said that's the same thing happens to the believer then he walked through his christian journey he walked through his christian journey doing what the father said now look the only the only difference in him and me and you is he said i only do that which the father shows me we have a problem with that you don't do everything you don't even do everything your natural father says much less your spiritual father that's what i told my kids they wanted to be famous i said you want to be on oprah winfrey i said i'll promise you one thing do everything your parents tell you to do and you'll be on oprah winfrey because ain't a kid that's ever born since adam and eve had the kids in the garden of eden that's ever done exactly what their parents said because we thought they were dumb as a rock till we were about 30. amen then they smartened up just i mean boom they just got smart no well jesus didn't have a problem with that he knew who his father was amen so that's but see that's what we're if we don't have the mind of christ and it's supposed to change us because you know what if my natural father was not a christian and he was an alcoholic or he cursed like a sailor i don't want to have i don't want to be like that i want to be like my heavenly father all right so that's we got to see that there's there's a difference in us and jesus because he did only what the father said because the father was holy so he only did holy things he did run some people out of a temple one time got a little angry at him hmm yeah and planted a rope he plotted his plan by platting his rope cause it took a little while i bet he didn't make one about that big no he probably made one about that big of leather and he's sitting there in the corner of that temple and he's going all right i'm gonna start with that one right there cause that one's gonna hit the door first i'm gonna start that one's last because he's the one that's been beating them animals and then he tied that knot and he took off well you know what it's okay don't let the sun go down in your wrath though but he's our example but what did but re the reason he did it why for correction he only did it because they were doing something wrong he didn't do it because he just wanted to and he didn't think they ought to be no it wasn't he didn't think they ought to be there the bible said he said you have made my house my father's house at dinner thief he was quoting scripture so he had to fulfill that skill they were fulfilling that scripture and he just helped him get out of the temple a little bit faster than maybe they should have but he said upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it let's go ahead and read number two quote number two what visions are 1956. skip the first one from thirst because brother brown says faith is a divine revelation that's the same thing with all of us it's a divine revelation it's not just a revelation it's just an aha moment it's a divine revelation and like we were talking some of us were talking the other day if you get a true revelation it'll never leave you it will never leave you if you get a true revelation it will never leave you no one can talk you out of it doesn't matter how many preachers get in the pulpit doesn't matter how many naysayers come by if you get a revelation of who you are it's solid and nobody can shake you from that nobody you know like we've stood before people in the daniel 70 weeks and they poor people can't understand we're reading the bible you got to make the prophet's message compared to the bible and it does but not your thinking amen but you stand in the face of that like dad stood in the face of it since the early 70s you just stand there and you let god do what he needs to do don't worry about what they think because you know what nobody's ever proved it wrong oh they give their ideas but no they ain't going to prove it because it's bible right some people in just a few weeks ago had questions about said did i believe there were seven years of tribulation i never said that never have i said that but there is seven years left after the rapture according to the bible have y'all heard bible oh sorry bible it's the b-i-b-l-e read daniel 9. read the bible amen and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week i didn't quote that right god did and who was that he that's the antichrist we won't be here what's one week seven years never have we said that there was a seven years of tribulation it's only three and a half years but there's seven years left to finish the 70 weeks of daniel according to the thank you y'all get it in a minute but not really and then people fight you over and they're fighting the bible they're fighting the bible and they won't come to church now because they're you quoting the bible how can a christian not come to church if you quote them the bible shows where people's at all listen we're all going to manifest who we are you can sit there with stone face all you want to you can stand there and smile all you want to you can do it but we are going to manifest who we are when this thing comes down to the very end you know what judas probably he was like this is great man praise the lord yeah then he then he did what he did just right before they crucified him just a few minutes a few hours before they crucified him oh you know what brother colleen i was going to tell you that scripture that you read psalms 116 you know in tradition this is tradition in the tradition of the jews the bible tells us either in luke or john one of the no mark or luke it says they when they left the upper room they sang a hymn and then they went in the garden of gethsemane that's what they were saying they were singing psalms 116. if you'll read that psalm 116 you'll see exactly why they were singing that psalm 116 amen so that was good but i was reading up on that one down and it said that the tradition of the elders says that that's what they saying when they went out to the garden of gethsemane right before he died that next day so let's read what our visions you know i got happy this morning right last night this morning because of the christmas story what we call christmas story but the bible talks about god coming on earth in human flesh i got excited about it i ain't worried about what they think about it out there in the world i'm talking about what he's done for me and you that he had to come as a baby for me not for you for me he came as a baby for me not because it was december 25th which it was not december 25th he didn't come to the world so we could give christmas presents he came to the world to give us the greatest gift brother brown said god's wrapped gift what'd he wrap it in not a swaddling clothes you wrapped it in human flesh because he had to be human flesh so he could die so see the bible says that'll be this afternoon there'll be a day that will not be either light or dark but in the evening shall be light now when the holy spirit first fell on the church that was what now 120 in the upper room on the day of pentecost everybody with me don't fall asleep already bob they're falling asleep on me he's in mobile now when the holy spirit first fell on the church it was in the eastern people in jerusalem the 120 in the upper room that's over there right right where the holy ghost that's where the holy ghost fell and great signs and wonders was done by the church in the early pentecostal age of the early church then the next round of apostles then come in the catholic church which catholic is in rome moving a little further west all right then 1500 years luther wesley was in where um germany britain see how it's getting right there john wesley's right and even john wesley came to the united states he actually was in the in savannah for for a long time he came to savannah georgia to try to convert the indians how to church there in in savannah georgia and then he wasn't very successful because that's not where he was supposed to start preaching at there was one to come to preach in america he needed to go he needed to go back to england so god sent him back to england where he just tore the whole place up amen then the next round of apostles then came the catholic church then 1500 years then the lutherans and then from then on down it's been a day where the light went out it's been a daylight enough that you could see that jesus was the son of god what he said i'll build my church on that you should repent but the real bright light of the holy ghost has never shined through these ages certainly the bible said it would as the prophet said it would just as sure as he said they couldn't believe because isaiah said there wasn't been light because the prophet said but remember he promised light in the evening time all right there's been enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong there's been enough light to know that you believed on the resurrection of the lord jesus we all have to believe on the resurrection we believe he resurrected or we couldn't get saved amen accept him as personal savior put your name on the church book and live the good life but as far as signs and wonders and direct rays of the sun shining it hasn't been since pentecost and i'll add a little bit to that sorry i'm going to add a little bit to that because he and now he's talking about where pentecost come then i say the word come brother brown brought the word of god pure and unadulterated to the people he tried to do what he could because we're going to read here in just a little while where he had to indict this whole generation and i mean we talk about you talking about talking about some uh denominations let me read you what he said i'll read it to you in just a little while and listen it's not the denomination remember it's the people it's not the people it's the denomination they're under all right because you and i if you're in under false if you're under false today you're in a denomination if you're under false pretense if you're if you have your own revelation your own idea of things you're on you're a denomination because what is a denomination it's a doctrinal difference that you can't agree with this one so you move over to this one and if you don't like this one there'll be another one over here that the devil will give you that you can go to that one all right but listen remember god built his church though on the good people that were in that church amen listen there's going to be thousands upon thousands the bible says can't number them that's going to come up in the resurrection through all these church ages that were born again believers bride yes got the same new birth you do but they didn't have all the fullness they didn't have all the light only a little bit of light shown on the world like i said last sunday up until luther's age nobody even had a bible even when they tried to do it the catholic church took it away from them said just believe what we tell you so they all they had to go on was that you know what if that's all they had to go on god couldn't condemn them for not having a bible i mean i thank god a prophet came one time and he said you know he said those heathens in africa that's never heard of the lord jesus he said they'll be judged by what by how they live in their tribal order how about that and you know what they'll be given eternal life if they live their tribal order same way with the indians over here the indians that we drove out they they the happy hunting ground the the the sun and the spirit and all that they were spiritual people you know what geronimo was a spiritual man brother brown said saw visions how do you know that there was no documentary back then to tell him that god told him that so he can make an example and show us that god is not god's looking for a what do you say an honest and a contrite heart but you got to do that honest and contrite heart you know a lot of people say god knows my heart well yeah probably no he does he knows the fullness of your heart so you can't just sit at home you know you know he knows your heart he knows your motive and your objective and listen brother brown said if your motive injective is right he said god come on scene so that's what i want i want i was praying last night i said god let's get our motive and objective right not just come to this church not just to have you know eat good dinner and have a good comfortable place to sit that'll make you all fall asleep because it's hot up here what's temperature is it 70. okay it's we're in that transition time where it's not hot enough outside to turn the air conditioner on so and i ain't moving and i'm still hiding but that's what god said he said look he said there's enough night light enough light to know that you ought to do right and wrong there's been enough light to know that you believed on the resurrection the preachers preached the preachers preached they preached their heart out accept him as personal savior put your name on the church book and live the good life but as far as signs and wonders and direct way of the sun shining it hasn't been since pentecost but now what happened there was a restoration back to true pentecost not 1906 i'm talking about 80 30 pentecost where they baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ well they received the holy ghost they knew jesus wasn't a third person of the second person of the trinity and they knew they didn't receive the third person on the day of pentecost they received thee person peter said this is that that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh amen so now let's go let's skip some of this so we'll not be too long let's go on down if y'all don't mind let's go quote genesis 18 3 because remember god promised he would send the son of man back in the end time all right if he sent the son of man back just go to genesis 18 3 where abraham met melchizedek keep going right there and he said my lord we know what that is that that's that's adonai which means a man in fl god in flesh so he was meeting jehovah god god in human flesh so look at quote number four who is this melchizedek brother adam said god in this stage is this stage of his creation later formed in the flesh jesus we'll get to that this afternoon from the fir great beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it just spoke out in morphe later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to death for all us sinners so in a nutshell he's saying just as jehovah jehovah created everything and he carried those people down through the old testament he appeared as melchizedek he appeared as a as the uh captain of the host moses saw his backside but that wasn't jesus the flesh that wasn't the savior that's that's that's in isaiah said he'll give he'll give his soul a ransom but he gave his body as a sacrifice amen he had to be a lamb a lamb has to have flesh see in revelations 5 there's a lamb took the book now a lamb can't take a book a lamb has a hoof but in symbol john knew who that was that was the son of man standing there in human flesh god taking the book of redemption amen and brother ryan said and redeeming those that were in the book by him being in flesh so when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end and what are me and you with me and your attributes of god in the final end listen folks if this ain't the final end no this is the final end this thing can't go on too much longer there's things happening that we don't know about there's things happening that we do know about but i know one thing's for sure i know the one that knows the end he said he'd never leave us or forsake us he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing what meet god in human flesh and have discernment and do what take a body change see the rite of redemption it keeps going we see it revealed here in ruth and boaz what were they they were flesh people amen so god had to come down in human flesh to save mankind we know that he could not redeem as being jehovah listen he could not redeem being jehovah jehovah was god above them and only were readed this afternoon only by the blood of bulls and goats with sin covered not done away with so when that covering was over he had to go back and make another sacrifice when that one year was over if that priest didn't give that take that blood and put it on the on the corners of the altar the whole of israel were killed because of their sins so every year there's a remembrance we'll read it there in hebrews every year there's a remembrance because jehovah god was up here the angry god the one that looked down through the look down through the smoke in the fire but to be a redeemer he had to come through that and that's why i was telling you about that when i was reading the christmas story it threw on my heart how many times have you read something then all of a sudden it just really thrills your heart i mean you even anything else it just thrills your heart even in the bible you read that and you say man that's what he really did for me he went through all that why didn't god just wipe him off to begin with and just start all over well that wasn't his plan because he had you in his mind and he had you in his mind here in this church age so you had to be here in this church age to fulfill the attribute that he saw before the foundation of the world that's true predestination by foreknowledge amen that's another thing see you you people i had a guy call me about a year ago and he said i'd come out to your church and and go to your church if if your views on predestination were different i don't think the game goes to church now but i said my views i said i read y'all in the bible where it said buy for knowledge those he foreknew bible those he foreknew he did predestinate because they believe it's just signed sealed delivered there's nothing you can do you know like god's going to pull you through a tube and you just you know you're just brain dead no i don't believe that i know y'all don't either but the bible says by foreknowledge that's what i told you that's what i told that brother i said brother i said i was quoting you bible he never said another word he just got off on hunting or something i knew he didn't he didn't understand what i was talking about to begin with but i'd come to church with you if you change your view i said i'd have to change the bible i'd have to literally change the whole bible brother brown said the whole part of predestination is built on foreign knowledge for knowledge first because it's for knowledge knowledge before before it even happens he foreknew those he did predestinate oh my goodness people you see though can i make this statement we've come a different way oh we've come a different way [Applause] because the preaching of the word in this church from starting with brother mode all the way through brother dale and all of us ministers we've come a different way i'm sorry i'm just i'm well you know what if that's not my testimony then i'm going to go somewhere else but why am i going to go into confusion where they can't even quote the bible i can't believe people don't read the bible well you know what they read quotes well folks brother branham had to be quoting the bible he was a bible prophet you're just not getting what he's talking about but listen that's that's under the son of god ministry you can be that you can be confused that doesn't mean those people are lost right pop that don't mean they're lost don't mean they're going to hell they just don't understand they live a good christian life they put their name on the book they know what to do right or wrong they don't cut the hair they don't you know they do all the do's and don'ts they pray to god they go to church they pay their time they do everything but they just can't go up to that next level they just can't go up to that next level listen the disciples couldn't go up to that next level because they didn't have the person inside of him but now that was back then that's where he built his church though on the holy ghost coming into those 120 in the upper room and then they dispersed out into the into the world i guess you might say but now remember see so satan gets a hold of it and for and for four more church ages up to columbia where the catholic church took over there was a lot of truth but there was a lot of error that was being poked in there that was not god listen jesus christ is the son of man he had no fault in him he had no false doctrine in him that's your son of man no false doctrine jesus didn't have to be corrected okay that's what we're gonna have to come to oh brother what did you say we'd never be corrected no they didn't god never took listen it don't matter you got the holy ghost you got the baptism holy ghost you're signed sealed and delivered but you know what god still put deacons and preachers in the body to keep you straight and me straight all right so but you know why because we're a dual person we got the holy ghost in our soul we got some of that old nature that we try to keep that needs to die because see that's not working on your soul that's working on your spirit realm that's not working on your soul your soul's already signed sealed delivered your soul is eternal it's working on your spirit realm because it's what contrary jesus never had a fight with himself i had one this morning with myself okay that you didn't huh yeah you did louise thank you bro god bless you for being honest and awake praise the lord it is still hot up here aaron i'm glad i'm not one of them andrew glover i'd be absolutely sweating like you wouldn't believe so what did god do god winked at their ignorance through the church ages he winked at their ignorance in the old testament because he knew these prophets were going to come on the scene these prophets isaiah jeremiah ezekiel daniel all these different ones in the old testament and they were going to prophesy that it was going to be dark during a certain time and then the evening time there was going to be light but see god didn't require a rapture in the first age he didn't require rapture in the second age third age fourth age fifth age sixth age but he required a rapture because there's no more church ages can't go any further there's no more church ages so god required a group of people to eat not even just come back to the faith of the fathers that's the son of god but to go back to that son of man that spoke to them before the son of god got here amen i hope you understand that that's how important this is because luke 17 verse 28 says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed he's been hid folks he's been hid but he's to be revealed in the end time under a sodom condition lord of mercy are we not under one worse than sodom because it's not just two cities it's the whole world now even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed revealed reveal means to be made known and when something is revealed it has to be made manifest amen i mean listen have you ever held a revelation inside of you i haven't when god tells me something i like to tell people about it amen when god saved your soul that was a revelation wasn't it and you wanted to tell everybody about i hope you did i hope you didn't want to hide i got i got i got saved i don't do that no more no i was proud when god saved my soul cause it was a work wasn't sweaty for him but it was for me amen oh so y'all all came in easy okay that's fine that's good well just beat on the preacher then but when the son of man is revealed then we know that god showed himself through moses joshua we're going to read that this afternoon so let's go to quote number five the unveiling of god because god had to send a prophet that was so close there you go that was so close to himself now listen to me so close to himself the same signs the same wonders the same everything jesus did but now listen this man was not jesus remember what's the requirement of being the son of man you got to be virgin born that knocks everybody out everybody amen so they even william branham but listen but god told us we could live close enough to him even by our natural birth but we deny our natural birth and take on the spiritual birth of the one that didn't need a birth amen that's why they couldn't tell the difference when brother branham would now listen what about a man that you stayed around with and you went hunting with and he said you said well brother brown you know you're just sitting there with you you haven't brushed your teeth in three or four days you hadn't took a bath in a week don't ever try that and um they're sitting around the campfire really i mean they're out hunting and and one of them's going well brother brown i think i'm going to go over here and hunt over here and he's like no he sees the vision he said no he said i think i'd go over here go up this trail go up two mountains move over to the left and you'll find some game right there well if you lived around that all your life and it came to pass every single time you'd think god was sitting there because who else would know that but it was him using and yielding himself so much to god that god could use him to do that same way with discernment and all these different things that he did telling the people what they were going to do and what they had done in the past and can't be anybody but god and that is the bible because brother brother brown said you know jesus was have visions he'd have that's why god would tell him he told him through visions he'd have a vision he said he had a vision he knew he's going to raise lazarus from the dead it took him four days to get there because he knew he's gonna raise you from the dead anyway but look first he came as a prophet now this is what the son of man the son of man is what the prophet the lord himself will raise up a prophet like and unto me said moses all right so the prophet the son of man is the prophet notice he came as a prophet they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the holy ghost came son of man was crucified he went to heaven in acts 1 ascended up sent back on the day of pentecost the promise of the holy ghost then after the holy spirit came because remember that body that god had prepared jesus couldn't be on the earth while we're on the earth because he declared we're his body paul declared we're his body and members particularly he talks about written epistles known and read of all men and all these different things about us being his body so he couldn't have two bodies here at the same time so he had to take the original body up put it on the throne wherever you want to say i believe he's in the seventh dimension where brother brown couldn't go where brother bob couldn't see him because he's in the seventh dimension because he's reached immortality then after the holy spirit came he was then the son of god that's when he came back on the day of pentecost god inside of human beings he was the holy spirit son of god he lived through the church ages as son of god now in the millennium he'll be son of david sitting on the throne of his father david he is the son of god now and remember between the son of god see here's the promise that me and you have i want you to make sure this is a promise to me and you now remember brother brown said take god promises and do something with him because if he promised it somebody's got to be there to receive it between the son of god and the loudest sin church age they put him out behold i stand at the door and knock and in luke he said he would be revealed again as son of man i just read that to you luke 17 30 and all the different ones that we're familiar with as son of man the prophet now remember brother brown was not the prophet he was a prophet revealing the prophet because brother brown said the messenger of this age is what the lord jesus christ amen the prophet fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures tie perfectly together son of son of man son of god son of david but now remember god promised though that right in here he'd come back at the son of man that's what he's saying right here he's going to be right here because what is son of david son of david's after that last week that we're talking about of daniel 70 weeks when the millennium starts he will be the son of david but he's got to come back he's the son of god now he's got to come back as the revelation of the son of man then he's going to be revealed as the son of god to the jews amen then he's going to be the son of david promised that he would sit on the throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel where me and you are going to be there on a honeymoon amen i hope you all understood that and studied it that's that's something that shouldn't be a question in your mind you should know why the millennium is not to us we're eternal millennium is time brother brown says over and over he said it's it's to prove the sin curse is over your sin curse got over way before that if you become if you become the bride of jesus christ your sin curse is over with yes that's right you say oh no quit looking at this because it's going to be changed and this sin curse is going to be over it's a great drama he's acting it out you know why god's doing all this to prove the devil who he is and to prove that he can work through something that satan marred because satan marred every one of us what god's fault oh yeah we say it was our fault it was but it's satan in to us is what causes us to do the things we do okay now let's read number six the indictment you need to read this whole because basically he's telling them watch i'll just let him remember they were very religious people that did that are you talking about the crucifixion because they didn't crucify the son of god you can't crucify the son of god that's spirit god you crucify the son of man which is a human flesh person you got that not a different person but a human flesh same person in there and we'll get it at this afternoon or later on because when we get to the crucifixion we got to see that the body was tor the sp the soul was tore out of the body all right remember they were very lit but listen we got to get the body inside that flesh first i mean the soul inside that flesh first that's what we're talking about this afternoon that's the christmas story remember they were very religious people that did that they wasn't outsiders they were religious people of that day and that's what's doing it today is the religious people same crucifixion same thing today quickly there they crucified him remember how he explained all that they are the most religious people religious place in the world they the most religious people the most horrible death they crucified the son of man then then sure when they were rejecting god's word made manifest accepting their creeds instead of the word now he's talking about caiaphas but he's also talking about today right i'm just going to read you what the prophet said is that what they're doing today that's exactly doing the same today he was the word and they rejected the word that's one point i want you not to miss see i want you not to miss he was the word and when they rejected him they rejected the word and when they did reject him they finally crucified him and that's what they've done today crucified him kill the son of man again that's why the son of man had to come back in the end time and that's what they've done today reject the word of god and accepted their creeds and has crucified publicly before their congregation the workings of the holy ghost or the holy spirit and they're guilty and i indict them in the name of jesus christ there's your indictment he's not in die he's not indicting the drunks he's not indicting the whoremongers he's not indicting the prostitutes he's indicting those people sitting in that church at that moment plus everybody else that's got a denominational idea and they're guilty and i indict them in the name of jesus christ how strong is that we say oh that we don't need now they're they are good people but if they accept that religion and become blinded by it then they're part of that order and there's nothing you can do about it amen so now let's go to number seven proving his word then i want to read something to get us ready for this afternoon now after 1900 years with the church ages past and all the things that he prophesied of luther wesley we just went through and seen it drawn out and the moon come down and draw it out and the lord brought it on the board here for us and showed it come down himself and confirmed it to be right why can't these people see that and they think he's a false prophet and they think they just he conjured all these things up come on people agree they're they're blind there's no doubt he confirmed that this prophet was right listen he confirmed this prophet you know why he confirmed that you know how i know he confirmed him because he confirmed him to me he confirmed him to me that's how i know he's right that's how i know he's there's no faults in this message because he confirmed it to me i don't know about you you've got to decide for yourself but he confirmed it to me after 1900 years and we're at the end of the layout to see in church age he promised in luke 17 30 we read it that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was in sodom upon the earth did he do it does it have to come to pass it's impossible now he stops his thought i believe he was going to say it's impossible for it not to pass now remember he came in three names the son of man a prophet the son of god the spirit remember come back on the day of pentecost and live through the church ages then son of david for the millennium which has nothing to do with us but in between this conjunction now according to his own words in the day when the son of man shall be revealed luke 17 30 reveal himself as what not son of god now listen he revealed himself as the son of god through all the things i was telling you about believe on the name of the lord jesus christ baptize the name of the lord jesus christ receive the baptism of the holy ghost do right do good do what you're supposed to do live a good life you know what brother anne brown brother brown told him on the sixth seal he said go on as you are live a good simple life he said because it's gone from you you know what he was telling him he said son of man has not been revealed to you yet and he'd been revealing him the whole week see how simple that is he was set there the whole week and he said i was hoping y'all would get this preaching the greatest message he'd ever preached no one had ever preached that except jesus himself that's how great that message was for that week right and he was on the sixth seal and they didn't have a clue what he was talking about but he didn't call he didn't say y'all a bunch of bastards he didn't say y'all much an idiot he said no go on and live a good christian life they know what he said don't live a good christian life this is not for you this is for somebody else it's going to be revealed in other words in a different way in the day when the son of man shall be revealed reveal himself as what not son of god son of man will reveal himself in a different way now when when you say that everybody's like well it's got to be just something totally different no it doesn't the son of man came on this earth the very guy listen folks he was the absolute old testament walking on two feet absolutely not a second person and listen a jew don't believe in a second person they believe in one god they believe when god comes back as a messiah it's going to be god in human flesh and they missed him but he was literally the walking old testament but he came a different way than what they wanted him to come will reveal himself in a different way now what does that make malachi 4 exactly right the son of man will reveal himself not in a whole big denomination and things as we've been through the ages but he would manifest himself as son of man again to make manifest malachi for and in that day i will send you elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers what do you have to do zerubbabel had to clean the foundation off and rebuild right he didn't make a new foundation swept that one off he didn't make a new foundation foundation was already there he just built up this statue of a perfect man so me and you could climb up there with him he said oh brother wait we can't get up there where brother brown was at i know we can't get exactly where he was at because i'm not a prophet but you know what i can get close because i'm telling you he's laying in the grave the headstone didn't come while he was alive not the fullness the fullness of the headstones in me and you we need to pull him out of the grave that doesn't belittle him and make us know better it puts a position that we've got to come to that we've got to see that that headstone is the bride of jesus christ nothing else but us but how'd he get here all right let's read now remember he was the whole of the old testament he fulfilled like what was it 400 scriptures just right when he was crucified but i say he fulfilled every one of them the whole time he was alive from genesis 1 all the way to malachi 4. but he came a different way he didn't come the normal way brother brother came a different way they loved him when he was healing the sick and raising the dead and praying for their people and sending them i mean he feel churches full they don't get the holy ghost he said y'all got the holy ghost he said go find you a good full gospel place to go to church he was filling their churches up but buddy about 1960 61 62 63 obviously and on further into his ministry huh no they hated him they won't have nothing to do with him no more if it wasn't for that what brother carl williams i think with the full gospel businessman he'd have never got in them anymore but thank god somebody kept the door open so he could come in and preach and we could have the tapes didn't matter about them sitting there i'm sorry for them people they're already gone on but i'm getting what he said hey man i'm getting the real reason he came amen he didn't come just to heal the sick raise the dead sure jesus didn't either he came to save your soul we'll read that this afternoon so let's go to isaiah let's go to the very end brothers isaiah 7 13 and isaiah 9 6. we got to get jesus here we've we've read ezekiel we read it last week son of man prophesied can these bones rise yes isaiah 7 13. now listen and he said hear ye now house of david house of david coming to the jews is it a small thing for you to weary men but will you weary my god also therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son son of man a son a flesh child a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel by interpretation that would be god with us isaiah 9 verse 6 musicians get ready to come when i finish reading this isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born child child their son of man there's a there's a flesh person coming about but unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david here's the son of david promised right here he never forgot israel he's going to rule those 12 tribes of israel in the millennium under their time but not for us and upon his kingdom upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this this afternoon we're going to see that first scripture fulfilled because gabriel is going to go talk to that virgin this may be simple as it can be but i'm telling you i had a i had a good little i had a good little pentecostal revival last night just going through this again to know what god did for me to know what he did for me and how it all got started and that he's gracious let's stand to our feet he's gracious he knows what we need he knows how we need to get here he knew we were going to have to come born and sing shaping an iniquity especially my mother's room a liar doomed and on our way to hell lived uh brother claude says the hound dog life but you know what if you're born again today god never saw a bit of it he don't remember it it never happened we knew it did but he didn't that's why the son of man revelation is going to be a little bit different and we're going to talk about that because you know what he did he came different but he didn't come different from what the word said he came exactly the way the word said walked right up to caiaphas and said i am he and they crucified him for saying the truth that's why we're not so popular we tell the truth and when you tell the truth you're not popular oh that's okay let's sing a song god bless you oh there is [Music] shall come no more clowns in the sky and no more tears is [Music] that day is this [Music] day that will be [Music] until after he'd already left [Applause] [Music] a glorious day that will be listen to [Music] this sorrow there no more no more sickness because of what a man did for us god died in human flesh so that you and i could have eternal life will

his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through thy promised land what a day glorious day that will be oh what are they but you know what i believe the bible says we see him now face to face i believe he told us that we could see him we see him in each other we see him in the in the life of the prophet we ought to be able to see him in the life of me and you we ought to live so close to god till they think we're god we got the same holy ghost we we should have the same discernment i'm going to bring that quote i read this morning from adoption brother brown said when you get he said give me a church that's got all sin out of their life that has no grudges between each other that has love between the brethren and us he just gave a big old long list i'm brother john that that paragraph's this long in the adoption series and he starts listing he said then god will bring brotherly kindness he'll bring joy patience temperance knowledge people will start speaking in tongues he just kept naming what we would get if we would get all this stuff brother brown said one unconfessed sin can stop the whole church from getting their blessing one misbehavior do you ever just try to clean yourself up when you get come to church man i do folks listen this is a fearful place this is the house of god this is a fearful place don't be fair to don't be scared to come here but be fearful that god is going to discern something in our life or we're going to hold it and somebody will not be able to get something and we'll be held accountable for it we need to get everything out
