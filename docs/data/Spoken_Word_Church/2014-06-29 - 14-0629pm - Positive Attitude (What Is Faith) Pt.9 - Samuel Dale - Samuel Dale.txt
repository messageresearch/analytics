really enjoyed the message this morning looking forward to hearing this afternoon the wound continuing our thoughts of what we've been speaking on in faith and if you'd like to turn back into scripture where we've been on Hebrews 11 and then we'll go to habakkuk 2 Hebrews 11 habakkuk 2 now remember the Bible study will be this coming Saturday night six o'clock come and be with us we're trying to be in the Book of Romans studying and just you know going from that part and then on Sunday we will be having the um just the morning service only and brother uh William will be with us speaking more live on we'll be speaking with us Mr Monica's uh brother be speaking for us the Lord willing and won't be any evening service we'll be having a time together and fellowshipping about the 4th of July because uh we started here July the 4th 1971 and it's just a good time to have the weekend for that but we're going to have a big fish fry and it will also be chicken tenders I got the notice on that we will be having fish be having chicken tenders be having macaroni and cheese I announced this morning there'd be hot dogs but I think they changed that to fish how many chicken tenders and be macaroni and cheese round baked beans coleslaw Hush Puppies tea lemonade and beet cakes so that ought to be a good time so we'll have the service and then when we get through Sunday we'll go right on into having our fellowship together so remember that so remember it would be chicken tenders and fish not hot dogs they decided that would work work better with the frying of all the stuff and fixing it amen uh remember to continue to pray for a little Abby having the troubles and all with the the parts there it's some kind of a thing going around and and they don't want to bring her out until because she it was contagious as long as you've run the temperature so they don't want her to be around the children in tanks and all like that or don't want to pass it on she's watching them sir today so we say hey Abby Abby and we'll we'll we miss you but uh all right Hebrews 11. let's see if I got all my announcements um oh we will not be having the communion that would be our first Sunday so we're not going to have the Communion next Sunday we will have it the week after for this time only this month only because of the afternoon service you know and the eating and things we won't have the communion without the communion on the second Sunday instead of the first for this month only so remember that all right the heavenly father we thank you for your love your grace your kindness thank you for you and we just ask you now that you have your way with each one of us Lord and father that we could sit down just for a moment and listen and let you speak to our hearts and our lives we love you and we thank you we just commit everything into your hands remember all of these that are sick Lord and just touch each one and just let your delivering power be there to heal because we believe it and we ask you to have your way with us here today as we try to speak your word you come and speak to each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in your loving grace in Jesus name amen now remember what we were talking about last Sunday or what was it this past Wednesday when we were using uh Hebrews 10 38 that the thought Paul is laying down is about faith all right because you say in verse 38 there you know the just shall live by faith all right so then when he comes down a couple of verses then you start the 11th chapter and verse one and look what he says now Faith what this up here that you're to live by is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear all right now we want to go over to where we read in habakkuk 2 and verse 4. behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his Faith you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I want to hold a thought I was going to continue on with a point we did get some of it Wednesday but um we were on talking about the substance but this part just came in and I want this to uh fit in I believe in the right place that we're going to talk about you know what is faith and we'll just go from that point and uh you know and tried this past Sunday we were in that on the afternoon service but you know we talk a lot about faith you hear that especially among the Believers of the message because it's one of the things that that we we know for Surety like the prophet said we need a revelation more than anything see because it's only by revelation all right are we anything whatsoever so then what is faith then thinking about it that what we read that it's the substance of things hoped for now so then we go back to one thing what is faith and we know that faith is a revelation all right we'll read these things but if the world came into existence from things that do not appear as we just read you know which means that uh there was no such thing as anything there is that carnal enough for southern language to be there just wasn't anything and and all at once things begin to be created substance begin to come into being within wherever that substance came for from would have to be greater than the substance itself because the substance didn't bring to Faith faith is the substance all right now it's not that it's going to be and we'll read in a little bit that hearing is not faith the but that's what we think we've got it in our mind our concept or our thought about faith and this is this has been bearing with me and you forgive me for just being blunt about talking about it but it's been you know we we spend so much time talking about faith until um I think that most people have in their mind that faith is just oh an ability to believe or it is our believing you know well what do you mean I have faith well the prophet would say well what are you doing in the prayer line see we proved that we don't have the substance but now our problem is that we it's the substance of things hoped for which means that really now listen and I know you see you go one way you go the other and it tricks your mind but if it's the substance of things hoped for then it's actually to you and to everyone else you can't prove it right see if you could prove it it's a scientific fact I mean I don't have to prove this Pulpit exists it's a scientific fact so I'm not trying to have a faith for a poop hit it's already been brought into existence and how did that come into existence well we know in the scripture as we were trying to bring out through faith that the word of God my point today is one thing how sure is the word of God now and my thought is a quote the prophet made one day and that's what I'm trying to get away from just our mental thoughts he said if under the blood of bulls and goats he said flies fleas and frogs come into existence he said why would we stumble at the word of God bringing squirrels and things into existence now I know what most people think about that but I don't think that away it's like one big man in the message passed on now he said that third pull is only for the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham well that just kind of pulls us out of this picture doesn't it kind of you know kind of drops us back so then you know if that's the way you believe it then you don't have much hope at all let alone a revelation because what would you be hoping for all you would have in that situation if you do not believe that the third pool is for you then you would only be having hope and it wouldn't be hope that is an anchor of the Soul now Abraham talked about hope we'll get back to those things when we get back into the substance part you see Abraham's hope wouldn't I hope you know he wasn't hoping he was going to have a child his Hope was faith well you'll find in in Hebrews that it speaks now look I got one more now but it's 15 times in the book of Hebrews 11 there that it speaks of his you know talks about by faith all right and then there's four times it talks about through faith and remember that what I said and we went back and looked at it that the word faith is only used two times in the Old Testament so we would think it was a great thing and it is because Abraham's hope was a revelation to him all right which was faith it's just a way of expressing it the best best way I can say is because when you bring the word faith into the New Testament understanding you really get something you can anchor into and you can see that as we'll get to it later that those Old Testament Saints they didn't have the new birth they didn't have Christ Living in them they couldn't say the life that they were living was living by his faith and that's why I chose to use a habakkuk the way it is remember and it says the just shall live by his faith all right now his faith can be an Old Testament word of Hope all right but now remember Abraham's Hope was a substance all right now I was trying to get a point across and I don't want you to lose that because to me it's a very vital thing to know the difference between the Old Testament of what their wording is for it and the New Testament of what our wording is for it because we're coming to a positive thing and then your Prophet took it into the greatest height that could ever be in a message called perfect faith now if if you take Faith as being what it is me and you could look back in the Old Testament and see that it was a revelation to them but they were a little hindrance about the things being done and they were only speaking forward but then when you would strike the New Testament it would start talking about faith as a substance form right then as I said your Prophet would title the message perfect faith perfect faith all right why would he be bringing it that way when we'll read it a little bit when he said the disciples didn't have perfect faith is it called they had an epileptic child you know to not be healed if you understand what I mean I'm trying to get a view of the overlay of the Bible as to how that it can speak back here and it can be so positive until to those people it was a substance to them all right but the real substance part had not come into being yet so then they would have to be depending upon the New Testament and is that Hebrews 11 40. a day without us cannot be made perfect all right see then bring it over into the New Testament and picking up Faith and to realize then now you're going higher into the order and uh you're realizing that even though these people with substance substance faith you know okay but yet they're waiting on something right because the people are in the grave today the bride of Christ right Waiting For What somebody to come to a place and that's why I chose to using the wording that he's used coming to a place of perfect faith perfect faith and perfect there being like Matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect all right and that word doesn't mean that you're not right and you're made right you know you're not pure you're made pure we now buy the prophet have the understanding of what does it mean it means it's not a full age yet right because the word perfect is the word complete so then you're not having to change it you're having to come to an understanding of faith and how that you can say they had the faith I know that's been hard seemingly baby for me maybe I've had the trouble to try to explain it but that's what I look at go when you say that the Old Testament people didn't have the new birth you just feel people going um does he mean they ain't saved it's like I always tell you you talk to your neighbor about one God water baptism you know and you're trying to show them and a little bit something strikes and they'll say you mean my Obama wouldn't saved no you ain't mentioned Mama but they've come to a realization that there's a difference in what you're talking about and what they've been believing all right now you see we want to all call what we have as faith revelation right now come on be honest at least for yourself because they're going to help you lie especially to yourself there was a time that you believed the Trinity was right now we may have had different versions I was probably more Oneness than I was Trinity because you know I I just couldn't go along with the trinitarian concept and I would argue with the people about it you know into Baptist and uh well see we we thought we had a revelation right and our Revelation was so great until we would make statements from that to show how great our Revelation is you've heard the one what when I get up to heaven and I come to find out there's not three of them I'll turn around and leave you've heard down and really as I said maybe something you say I was in heaven and I'll walk out well there's only one other place to go but that's none of my business just trying to make a point I try to speak to you to make you think about what I'm saying all right but have you ever had it down pat I remember who was it somebody years ago might have been brother Schrader I'm not certain but uh my brother said said I had it down pat that a man was saved by works he said I had all the scriptures because I said I'd read these things about you know the works and the things when he said one day I got a book and said it said we're saved by faith and said this man laid down a great lineup Through the Bible that it was not works it was saved by faith he said I wound up being massively confused well have you ever had a what you thought was a revelation amen you know have you ever had the Lord told me ever heard people say that well then when it don't come to pass who are you going to blame you know and evidently wasn't a lord or it'll come to pass right right but my point is and what have I been getting on have you ever had a revelation have you ever had a substance faith something that no matter what anybody would say they can't talk you out of it very few people's ever had that really just how something the Lord spoke to me well like I said I've never heard any preachers outside the message inside the message beside the message over the match anywhere I really never heard any preacher say that it was a devil telling him to bring that sermon that day have you I've heard a lot of false doctrines all the way down through time and every one of them was a revelation well we're in the time of where it used to be especially that they had the dates and the times and Seasons your older ones in the message remember that you know I mean they had this and if it don't happen here then you know what you know what great Revelations like I told you that man called me that time and said what do you think about this Resurrection on Good Friday I said praise the Lord he said sound like you don't believe it I said well I didn't know it it's not been made known to me you know it's coming this Good Friday he said well they do have it figured out and if it don't come by Good Friday today's about 30 40 days later I said now sound like you don't believe it see if you've got a revelation you don't have to prop it up right you don't have to make excuses for it not happening you know for sure what it's going to be all right now if the Bible's right you say well you're something that's your question that's not mine he says now Faith is that is his present tense right now and thee is singular like John D Baptist so they wouldn't but one be Baptist so that put the Baptist out and that's what I told them then you know they'd say we're the we're Baptist called John with Baptist I said well first off he was under the law second off there's only one of them that the singular but if we believe the Bible that faith is the substance all right substances what do you think consists of whether it be natural or spiritual all right and it's a substance of things hoped for now that word hoped is not based in you can show it because there's a hope all right now Abraham had within him the ability to bring the child right he had the makings of things but yet he needed some help to be able to bring a substance so he had to get somebody to help him and that was Sarah and he tried it with Hagar right he got his substance when he got a wild man right well that was his revelation amen now can I use the words of the Prophet when he said it starts in the doubt is that the way he said it he said the promise started with a doubt now we know Sarah doubted but Abraham evidently had a little problem he had a little bit of a doubt of course getting him a new wife was a good thing you know he probably liked that but yet there was a problem about that being God's promise do you understand what I mean you understand what I mean that Abraham had a hope that was a revelation right I mean you heard right around him how many times you know Sarah wrote anything different nope praise God we're gonna get it anyway he had a revelation one day I don't like to use it because I don't have any words if I could have found it I would have used brother Branham to say it so I'll just say it myself to let you do what you want to one day he began to have a little problem about the substance yet within him he still had the revelation and that Revelation now we're going to get to this if that Revelation come from God it didn't matter what Abraham done God was the one made the promise you remember Abraham give his wife away now we're just talking planes I mean if I'm off the message come and tell me but he would just Abraham begin to let Sarah's Doctrine to him in Hagar will bring the child well you know to start with Abraham didn't know who's going to have the baby right am I right God didn't tell them to start with Cyrus gonna have the baby he just told him he's going to have a baby right all right it took quite a while before God laid it down and said Sarah all right from here to there Abraham had the revelation that he was going to have a child right now problems in between because that was the promise God made problems in between begin to deal a little bit with Abraham and his thinking and you remember the prophet in the ways brought it out in the way we do with the scriptures that Abram was the father of Ishmael and Abraham was the father of Isaac and that's why it says take thy son thine only son see so God didn't count all of Abraham's problems and his doubtings and frustrations because he made the promise he got you to start with who is going to have the baby right but he also knew what was going to happen in between but he had to let Abraham run through all of that and there he was just an ordinary human being that listened to his wife and her revelation because that's what you remember he said well Lord even in the beginning the Lord let uh what was his name uh Abraham's servant let him be the heir you know let him carry on and he said no it's going to come from your lineage well he had that right so get what I'm talking about now I'm trying to explain the difference between the Old Testament thinking of people and the New Testament thinking that you and I should have there shouldn't be any question in the New Testament I'm trying to get you to see a difference between one and the other uh I goofed up and didn't bring my notes I'm laying there this morning packed up everything didn't bring them and I can see now why because I wouldn't be going according to him anyway but maybe that's the reason okay so here's Abram the father of Ishmael but Abraham is the father of Isaac so he said thine son that only son God had no recognition in his plan of Ishmael being of anything Abraham had he stayed with it correctly or Abram he would have held on to what God Said and said I'll wait but as the prophet said about Sarah he taught the church which brings it down to where we are and he said Sarah couldn't wait he said just like Eve couldn't wait and he said the church can't wait you remember shot in time God's worst enemies man look how long we've been here 40 something years since the prophet's gone you got types and shatters we went around horrible all along we it's about time to cross over you know well anybody want to start a victory march you know we'll try to get over but I think that what we need to do is just keep moving in the word of what it's really supposed to be all right so then Abram is the one that listened to Sarah right Abraham is the example of a true person with a revelation right so Abraham he said it's tigered knot the promise of God through unbelief but we're strong in faith in other words Abraham didn't consider what Abram done Abram listened to Sarah Abraham never listened to her okay coming over greater revelation Sarah had the revelation hey garkin the polygamist legal and it was everything was fine and and I'm honest and I'm just plain I don't understand why Abraham hadn't already had 10 or 15 wives it was legal in that time but he didn't choose to it took the woman they get him messed up right he was pretty good doing in staying with just one wife but by the revelation of Hagar I mean if Sarah Hagar comes into view and polygamy and Abraham comes into view right join the weakness of Abram he takes a wife hoping hoping that uh he could fulfill the promise of God don't you think so don't you think he considered that Yes Man are you listening you know we come down to a lot of infinitarian doctrines and a lot of them know holy I mean no uh no Eternal health and we come through a lot of more doctrines didn't we that we thought was the word of God and we swore by and we spent hours proving our revelation when it went to revelation it was a mental concept of a human mind to trying to move into a supernatural understanding right right do you understand what I'm talking about Abram but when it comes over to Abraham it says it didn't say Abram never staggered at the promises of God he said Abraham didn't because you see God made the promise and God knew who was going to have the baby he never made the promise was Hagar that's messed it up you know you got a lot of them things in the Bible it's hard to understand you know that brother Branham said that when Moses smote that rock the second time and I still don't fully understand this maybe you do and somebody might be able to help me but I fully don't understand why the prophet would make the statement yet I believe it and he said when Moses smoked a rock that second time he said it broke every scripture in the Bible every time what's your Prophet said well but there'd be no excuse today to how a Moses to Smite the rock the second time you know what I'm saying now in the New Testament it's always supposed to come up closer in the word substance if y'all to wait all the way because I'm having trouble watching them going to the funeral but are you listening is it there's no excuse today to have an Abraham Abram it don't matter what all this people tell you about marriage and divorce about the things the prophet said Daniel 70 weeks he said now polygamy is wrong and he said you don't need to use the word revelation or for God to speak to you something like that he said you don't need a revelation to realize that polygamy is wrong today which you know a lot of people still got that revelation right it's all right it's the going thing you go back in your two Soul people a lot of you don't realize it and and you did it at her and play around with the thoughts are too so when you was in those two Souls the very first thing they started out with was polygamy and the man proved it by getting a bunch of girls taking off Florida with them but I'm trying to express why would it be that you've got an Old Testament people and it would say by faith but then when you come to the bride of Christ and the example of the bride of Christ is over in the uh 12th 13th verse or somewhere in there we're true Faith Sarah conceived through is something you're in travel by is something present you see we have no excuse for wrong doctrines we're not supposed to be under the Abrams are the Moses we're not supposed to be under that we're supposed to be under the form of faith that is the substance and there should be no doubt whatsoever if there's any doubt after all of this garbage about run around and being wrong about a date run around and being wrong about this right around being wrong about if that's hindered your Revelation you never had one to start with amen amen right right yeah can I be that blood you never had one to start with you had a mental concept you had an Abram concept and you had a Moses that God said you didn't sanctify me you're saying divide yourself so now you better go back find out what he's talking about Sanctified me and set aside he said Moses you didn't set me aside you set yourself aside coach he said must we fix you water from The Rock see look at me my revelation and he could turn around later he'd say well I got the water didn't I and you know what he did but you know what broke the scriptures right my whole point we can talk about faith and what it is but can we go back to it's a substance it's in Abraham he had that revelation he was going to have a child right he got his wife's Doctrine mixed up in what he thought was his Doctrine her word but just remember now I'm going to say this because it'll help for later you remember it wasn't Abraham's Doctrine I'm going to say something don't be you're going to swallow so swallow and get it ready so you and I don't have no Doctrine you ever notice a prophet making this statement no law but love no Creed but Christ no book with the Bible and you go down and you tell somebody that and you hand them a card and you say here's a Spoken Word Church card said read on the back of it they turn it over and they read so no law but love no creeper Christ no book but the Bible why are you giving me these books you know well you got an answer come on they never put that in your face you're out giving out books you said you don't have books well if this and this is not the same all right if this message is not this Bible if this Bible is not this message then you got two books you're dealing with a lot of things that you've got trouble with but when you can anchor it down and say we're not stupid we know brother random made mistakes because he was a human being we know he said things and all that was human but so did all the prophets have problems and flaws right but that didn't stop anything you explain how that Elisha could curse him she by I'm gonna curse him children and ain't the Holy Ghost what are you trying to get to I'm trying to get to a point that you and I are not going to walk off this Earth now you better listen we're not going to walk off this Earth in a change upon the revelation that Abraham had we're not going to walk off this Earth in a Rapture with the Revelation that Paul had or other disciples so we better be trying to find a perfect faith a perfect revelation but a human with arrows right talks that's what I've always said the message is right messenger may have troubles because of the human being but be careful what you say his troubles are because I still try to have his his uh guesses than mine in your revelation you know I mean when he said and when he said at that time he said I used to think that that God hated me and Jesus loved me now remember he never did believe in two gods he had no concept of two Gods he's a prophet and now what's he saying he's saying I didn't see it right right he wasn't making it to people simply saying I don't understand but it said when I've seen them with the same person there's this revelation would require perfect revelation perfect faith all right so now if the world's waiting on you and I mean we better find a revelation he can't be tampered with right and we better get away from the sissified things of well I don't know like a brother I said the preached the sermon here that time oh he was really on fire and he read one quote he read the quote the either it not here he read it that wrote around and said if I'm off on one point then I'm off on everything you know he made that statement and said see like he's wrong about the dates out there so out of the message he comes well they didn't have a revelation you know how good common sense a little Revelation I'd be glad to tell him that because it's truth when you see what do you have have you ever had something that is yours something nobody can't argue about they can't talk you out of it they can't quote you out of it but you remember there's a lot of people can't be talked of out of their Doctrine that is not a substance you want to go to the pope of Rome until it there ain't three gods come on you get what I mean we could have it all figured out and worse than any denominations ever been what about it what kind of substance do you have well now brother Dale you sound like you're talking about maybe one of these days getting to a place that we can just speak the word I'm glad you thought of that because I thought that's what the prophet said when I said well ago the man said big following still have even though he's passed on he said that third Fool's only for brother random and Jesus I just happened to know where the quotes at where he said that the third pool was farther bright Church into the totally lost I just don't see how the church can have anything to do with the third pool you don't even know what it is that's right you believe that you don't know what it is see that's that's where we get into the wrong things with our thinking and it won't fit the word but yet we have this great revelation but I want to get into a thought but I said I'd do it so brother Joe would you pull up brother Anderson one we'll have the one for wisdom versus faith that brother Cauley showed me uh Wednesday night I guess it was and I said well hey he's reading I just hope all of you read I'd like for all of you to come and say look what I found I love the hat it don't bother me look what I found brother Daniel look what the prophet said that's what I want you to do see then that way at least we can talk about the same thing right well look what he says wisdom versus Faith paragraph 7 uh 479 then if Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith and what was the faith he taught knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready or can y'all say it okay all right what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now you believe the bride is predestinated amen the predestined native bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything is in order the Holy Spirit has been given the seed has been sown the evening lights has been shining the sign of Sodom that Jesus Promised is here and Malachi 4 a predestinated church he ain't talking about Odell he's on but oh your devil you might as well go on forget it because somebody's already got the seed song you know that we're in a day of a lot of marvelous things but once a woman gets pregnant at least they're not dealing with that anymore to try to get her pregnant again you know what I mean you understand I know I'm carnal but that's just making a point a woman is pregnant she don't get pregnant no more until the baby's born right well because she's pregnant why because the wounds closed when if our wound is not closed up to showing us what all this garbage can around the world is the message people then you ain't pregnant you're still having your periods do you understand that one I guess you're still in your problems but he says the bride has the scene seat sown into her what is the seed of God this word what is the word of God letters on a page Paul said to let her killeth this message the letter killeth the prophet said even while it's laying on the pages of this book I didn't give them that one but taken through there is a man here they can turn on lights paragraph 74. so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God made manifest as long as it's just in the book like this it still can be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what it spoke of being materialized then that is light on on the word Lord is laying in the pages of the book it can be questioned right now we agree there so then let me hold up the messages if you agree as long as it's laying on the pages of these tapes and books of the prophet it can be questioned that's right now you agreed with it was the longest thing on the pages of the Bible but now if you surely don't agree with it being on the pages of the prophet's message then you are you need a mental transplant because I'd certainly say this first before I'd say this but I'm certainly not going to say neither one I'm going to say what the Bible says the letter killeth with the spirit giveth life this message is letters on a page right whether you hear it on a tape or whatever his letters on the page you can take the Bible and I'm wondering why somebody hasn't done that you could take the Bible and virtually almost have brother Branham reading every scripture on one tape you understand me yeah you don't have to go to Xander buns or this out of the other to get them to read it you can do it but would that be life your computers now are made we can do it right here I can take the quote we just done and let brother random read that to you would that help you you know that's the only reason I haven't went with it they're done told me it's available because you can go in your computer right now and be read the book and right around them will read it to you right right does that make it more real no well now brother Dale what it is like one man said said you got to know his actions you got to know his moves and his things that's all right that's okay that's fine with me I don't have no problem with it with the moves and the actions not to revelation all right so now let's get to where we're going with the message a little bit I'll continue the rest of it Wednesday Cardinal problem I didn't settle that a long time ago I know for a certainty that if I have a part to do with this then I don't have to worry about passing on till I get my part done and then when I get my part done I want to pass on that's right and I want to be you know you're gonna have to pull me up okay look at what the prophet says we've read this over and over but we really do we read it go ahead with quote number one brother Anderson which is taken from the rapture progress 65. now what is faith we've explained I think at least I tried to that there's an Old Testament form of faith which is to them was a substance but they couldn't bring that substance into being it took the god that made the promise to bring it to pass we're in the New Testament form where we should move up to instead of just being by faith this is an example we can say through faith through the study of the word of God in the message we've come to this place that now it's perfect faith brother Dale do you have perfect faith on some things no problem saying that you think that's exalted what's yours I got that much you got that much what's the difference in what we got come on if you ain't if you ain't capable of saying that you have perfect Faith then you need to be an all to prayer for the Holy Ghost because that's what we're going to read right here whatever you have if it's been revealed to you his perfect faith but around him is so straight until if you'll keep reading you'll find it Those Old Testament signs those apostles they didn't have perfect faith he hadn't died yet a little woman at the whale he said well what do them people have back there they had a revelation are you saying there ain't no salvation in the old I just see them people doing that out there on the internet and he heard me preach you mean to say you don't believe them people saved you dummy go back and listen for a while and you'll hear me saying and explain it they had a faith and I'll give you the quote in just a second for the time but the disciples did not perfect faith when I epileptic child was there in front of them and the prophet explains why they didn't he said because they had Jesus with them he said it's hard to have perfect faith without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost frames it okay so we need to read don't we look to the church divide the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture so whatever you have wonderful hold on to it but someday there's going to be something happen it's going to be based upon what we already have that he can reveal it to us National revelation brother Revelation is faith and watch you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him and though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon the revelation the whole entire body now like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him when he got that baby by Hagar he humanly was thinking maybe that would be the thing but it never stopped his revelation because irregardless of who he got it from he knew he was going to have a child because God had done told him when are we going to get down to believing it like that when are we going to Anchor into believing it let's get a couple of quotes look at the next one the power of God Chicago Illinois 1965. excuse me 1955 1006. what is it Revelation what is faith and that's the title of the subtitle part of what we use remember we're still on positive attitude this is message number nine positive attitude we put a subtitle what is faith what is faith now here's a prophet going to explain what faith is God what did he say is God by the spirit revealing to you something that he's going to do or he's promised something he's going to do go ahead doubt all you want to you ain't going to change the word of God he's done said it that's it doubt all you want to see if you're unbelief will stop the Sun from coming up in the morning but I'll remind you of a man that had a faith that stopped it all right sir it wasn't unbelief that stopped it go ahead sit out there in the morning say you know you ain't coming up son watch now if you only hear Faith coming by hearing the hearing is not faith you remember the others with a loaf of bread and what we're talking about a loaf of bread is purchased by 25 cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of bread yeah but only mother quotes where the Prophet said I'm as good as God is right he's got it go to his faith but he's just showing us the 25 cents is the purchase and Power it's not the loaf of bread but 25 cents is not a loaf of bread see hearing does hearing only brings the word that produces faith man I'd write that down that's to me I love that hearing only brings the word that produces faith but faith is the substance of things so far the evidence of Things Not Seen and you see you hear the word God reveals it to you that it is the truth and by Spirit reveal truth confirms your faith to God it says you get it what about it let's get one more then real quick I'll review these but go ahead to the next Patmos Vision you've been through this when you've heard it many times Well I love it I love them all I sit down sometimes and I think sometimes like to take that I don't know what you call that index book you know it's the listen of all the tapes you know sometimes I just like to sit down and read you know just read the title you'll never do that get your book one of those index books and just read it like I've told you before after 65. let me skip Matthew 63. after the opening of the seals just sit down and read it Christ is a Mr God really who is this male chastity marriage and divorce things it ought to be every one of those messages gone into an eternity why did he have to preach Christ mystery of God revealed over again we need to always preached it because it went into a higher order amen well look ask God while we're talking on Revelation asked him to give you a revelation of this for it can only be known by revelation remember laying on the pages of the book laying on the pages of the message can be questioned if you don't want to be known by revelation and you can only be saved by revelation you remember the man that told right around him and said we don't accept no Revelation he said then God can't say can't get to you so you can't be saved without a revelation come on I wish I could stop right there and preach about two hours on what is a new birth what is a new birth I shouted I spoke in tongues I cried I'd done this the devil's got you beat what is the new birth Jesus Christ and we're quoting right around him personally reveal to you you what is a new birth the birth of the word amen that's why the Bible says being born again what is this statue of perfect man Brother Dean was talking about this morning being born again through faith are you listening look what he said he can only be known by Revelation you can only be saved by Revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you but now brother Dale that was back in 60. I only take what's after 63. well the one we read up there about Faith being the substance and the one we read yeah it was in 65. good you can't be saved until it's revealed to you nobody can call Jesus of Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's right that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost dude not enough he might say the Pastor said so the Bible says so then we're truths the church says so that is true but you don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and he's becoming you now you're not going to get a revelation if it's a revelation of God it is not in your human brain we just read intellectually there is no such thing as a new birth of the brain I agree that we need one still won't work and he's becoming you no man could call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by intellectual all right so what is faith Paul said it's the substance right right now if we believe that the word of God created all things do we believe that you remember the old colored Brotherhood and I'd rather be standing on the word and standing in heaven he's a coach Heaven and Earth will pass away but said his word won't pass away that man had a revelation he said I believe it from Kimber to killer said I don't even believe what's on The Giver yeah it's called Holy Bible you remember the man said what would a Mose or something I said Moses what if the Bible said jump through the wall he said I just jump he said because if he said it he's got to provide the home but let me review a second Old Testament people had a revelation but it was not by a born-again experience because it had not been given but it was Revelation he said brother Dale was it just mental no Abraham got the baby pretty good substance right right you see they had a substance a revelation the little woman that touched his garments brother random said perfect Faith since she had faith for the time perfect Faith I'll get this Wednesday he said those disciples did not have perfect Faith he said God it's hard to have perfect faith without the Holy Ghost he said go to Holy Ghost brings it that's right well let me restate what I started with the prophet said he may not under the blood of bulls and goats under their form of faith revelation they could speak flies fleas and frogs right he said why would you stumble at the blood of Jesus Christ speaking squirrel but if you're going to take the point that it's only for the third pool is only far brother random and the Lord Jesus and we don't have anything you know then don't worry about the rest of what I'm saying I thought the third pool was for the bride and a church well you look today and you go right over here and there could be somebody healed right there today there could be somebody saved right there today amen amen yeah but you don't understand what third pool is I thought the prophet said a quote that it was the revealing of his word so you want to talk about all the things that would go physically around that but it don't matter what physically goes on around that you're going to come back at one time it's a revealing of his word amen amen amen see because faith is the substance this world was created by the word of God we just read come from something that didn't exist oh I know how smart we are I know we know how to quote you know what to quote did you run into a lot of people's mind right now so let me quote it to you them seed it was created trees and I said could have come from some other civilization remember that quote I believe it I believe it 100 that it came from another civilization now your interpretation of civilization is vastly different than mine because you see I don't believe God was a blob no form is floating around why don't you just go with the energy Theory you know they can't be created or destroyed just go with that on energy he had one of them in one of the series you don't know something you remember the guy that great big old guy he had a brain come on kids you have to help me in a brain down here he was the brain to the whole thing it wasn't even up here everybody to call the brain we try to look for some other civilization it's been taught in organized religion I deal with more people created than Adam and Eve red foreign I like the Bible now what's your answer somebody says that more people was created than Adam and Eve what's your answer give me a scripture for it my Bible says Eve is the mother of all living if there's any monkeys in outer space they come from here extra rational beings don't believe in them travel to the Moon sure do but what are you getting that brother Dale substance the word of God is the substance remember Faith Revelation is the substance he existed before any substance that we think of he was real there wasn't another civilization before this that's right God existed we're in heaven whatever you want to call it he created angels and they worshiped him how long did that take before it was transmitted to Earth the seed that's in the Earth come from another civilization let thy be ready he didn't have to transmit it from here to there or gather it over here and plant it over there he spoke it and it became material faith is a substance and what are you getting at come on brothers I'm getting to the basis of one thing you may come as Brother Dean was ending up this morning talking about it would be at the Merced elements you may have to speak the next meal into existence did the prophet say that we had enough faith in us to create a world and go live on it did he talk of limbs being restored yeah but that was only in him see are you back with the doctrine it's a third bullet only for him in the Lord Jesus and I believe the third pool is for the Bride of Jesus Christ and even those people right over there the church can use it and see the effects of it but they don't understand what's going on because it's not fully for them but if you don't get nothing out of the message today I hope you get one thing Those Old Testament people had a faith but I was not a different faith when it come into the new but the New Testament Faith come by the blood of Jesus Christ being shed to let the life come back and live in the soul or in the Old Testament the Revelation was not in their head it was in their soul their being and they believed it why would we be concerned about it the next meal we have maybe spoken into existence he said well I don't know about that well I can tell you what happened here one time and we had a fellowship meeting and we didn't have enough food some of you witnessed that we didn't have enough food I said said it before him there will be enough food we took up food after they left well I don't know well see that's I can't see if you've never experienced it if you never tasted of a watermelon I can't tell you what it tastes like right but if you ever get a taste if you ever tasted of a God that's real that you can talk to and even talk back to you but be careful how you talk back remember the boy I told you at work did I was talking to him about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said told me he said God spoke to me in an audible voice I'm going to argue with him I believe him because see The Honorable voice said you go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so he came to me and he said finally one day and he said I got baptized this weekend he said young blood which was a Baptist preacher so he baptized me both ways I said before you say another word I'm going to tell you how you was baptized I said you was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you was baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost he said yes I said you erased your baptism and God spoke to you audibly that's your business but I said had you been in question about it if you'd had questions and baptized father son Holy Ghost and then baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I wouldn't have said nothing because you're a human being with a question but I said you erased your baptism you see go tell that man that God didn't speak to him what about your revelation stand what do we got what kind of Revelation do we have is it a substance I have no problem would anybody bring in me this Bible and want to know where I got it I enjoy it explaining it out of this God here is the only anchor I got if this Prophet was to speak contrary to this word it would have not been the prophet of Malachi 4 a sensible but when you get them together I don't have to line them up doc shots of a rifle I know he told me where God could speak to me but Faith cometh by hearing hearing is my faith look at Paul have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe I think that ought to be asked about the people of the message have you received the Holy Ghost since coming in this message what do you mean brother Dale this message is the Holy Ghost the word of God is the Holy Ghost with the letters on the page is not the Holy Ghost whether it be Bible whether it be brother Brown's message letters on a page be questioned have you ever had a revelation something to come to you I tried to explain it Sunday we want to make it some great big something some white bang coming out of the sky some trumpet sound when it's just simple it just comes as a knowledge a knowledge to you they can't be questions the knowledge yeah check it with this check it with this he said I believe that we have thee what'd he say Divine interpretation and perfect Vindication is that the wording something like that I believe this message has been Vindicated I believe the man that read this message to us love to read out of the King James version even though that was written by 60 something different men and it's not even based upon any one coming with an authority to say God told me this it's based upon an interpretation of all the written words that they had you understand oh brother that I talked to King James with the Holy Bible yeah you thought they had it when Peter James and him was here didn't you come out 16-11. I see we got a great revelation whether will it fit the word of God will it hold it when things start going wrong when they ask you to do not what are you going to do I don't like you to be so doomsday I'm not Doomsday foreign take no fear what shall be said when that hour arise because he said he would give us what to say that's Christian what about it anybody ever need the orders open just think about it pray for a revelation more than anything well how do we know where Revelation is right or not we've got the two things to check it with we've got the Bible we've got the prophet's message we can check it out to see if the horses are speaking to us our brother's asking about his wife and her eyes out Lord we just ask you to reach down and touch her because we believe your word live by your stripes he's healed we believe what we Preach Today about you and how real you are we just ask you to reveal to her then it's all done and it don't make no difference what so we walk in on the basis of that Lord saying your word says it we believe it thank you Lord now make it manifest in the name of Jesus Christ we believe you father it's that simple it's not the great prior you can make you're not heard for your much speaking you heard from a Heart of Heart a heart that believes God is thank you I love you Lord thank you it'll all be taken care of thank you all is well when we believe it is father we thank you and we just ask you to go with us now as we travel on our way home give everybody a safe journey we love you and we thank you thank you for your word and Lord we know we stumbled and Stamford and times because Lord maybe it was meant we didn't bring her notes where we try to follow him but we're just trying to get across to the people where we're at and where we're standing and then a revelation for the hour that we're living we know and believe you've done the things in the past we know and believe you will do in the future because we've read your word we may not understand what that is and what to do but we know and still believe that it'll take place the Lord Make It present tense because faith is right now the substance of what we're asking for the word had already said it it's finished so we believe it Jesus name amen you dismissed
