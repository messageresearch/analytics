========================================

yeah you get another one for that all right let's turn to my mom john 1. good to see everybody this morning good to have everybody here alive and well amen and praising the lord right amen okay we are on john 1. gonna be in the house he got back i'm not worried about that before this morning we're gonna see this little visitor we got here on the internet that's my grandbaby wife wave to everybody thank you baby john not the little john thank john okay john 1-1 all right now we're on the uh showing the dispensation of the son of god to the son of man and this in john it really chapter 1 verse 1 through verse 14 is showing the whole account of god's condescending just like i was telling the the brothers and sisters in tennessee this weekend this is not done for god's benefit this is done for our benefit god never changed he always was jesus christ he always was god he always was elohim he always was all these things he always was a human being he never was of just a blob of light no we saw him evolve from a light coming out and god saying let there be light and that was the christ well christ is not a separate person from god it's just god in another form just like your god in another form all right so it's god in another form so that we can understand him nothing he has to understand but he wants us to understand him and him being so great and so mighty and so um my thoughts are greater than your thoughts my ways are not your ways and all those things he wrote in the bible but yet he comes down to john and he comes down to paul and paul says you've got to have that mind you must have the mind of christ all right if you have the mind of christ and that puts you before the foundation of the world your thoughts are now the thoughts of god god's thoughts are not your thoughts our thoughts are turned to god's thoughts right because adam she'd pay more attention y'all did hey baby i love you adam had the mind of god because he was pure but he was a human man in human flesh and was going to be the god of the earth that's the way god wanted it but sin came in the picture and god said okay you can't do it anymore adam because now we need a sacrifice you need something that i put this gap i can't come and see you anymore like we used to in the cool of the day you're not going to have the thoughts you used to have now your thoughts because remember he told him he said your desire will now be for what your wife see that wasn't adam's first desire or he would have already had a desire for eve brother brown said they had a holy ghost veil they were they were naked did not need any clothes there was no sexual connotation there was no there was nothing that adam had in his mind that was about eve in that relationship form as it developed we don't know what would have happened because it didn't but they were all born not born but they were all created to be in the image of god eve just as much as adam because she was a part of adam because you can't make her any less then that would make you and i less we're not bible says we're co-equal joint heirs heirs and joint errors all right with christ but we look in john and we see that i see the development of my new birth in all this that's what you must see it's not that god's this something way out here that we can't understand no he condescended so so low till the world didn't even know he was here he had to leave and come back in somebody to make him realize who he was same way with the the people in the old testament even paul paul said i see through a glass darkly or or i don't see all things but i see jesus he knew that jesus was the almighty god he had a revelation that that almighty god come to earth come on the day of pentecost went into the hearts of believers and paul had a part of that in his soul and he now said we must have the mind of christ because i believe paul went back in the old testament and he saw the condescending of god that's why he could write the new testament and say what that was a type of what did he say he said we held with our hands the king of glory in other words we felt him we touched him he was right here and we missed him now he's in the hearts of the believer giving us the mind of christ that's why we can read scripture that's why we can read the prophet's message and we can see god speaking to each one of us that's what we got to see now is it's not just that this great god how he came from from light and so great that nobody can understand him down to somebody that we could relate to you got to see that personally yourself right how that happened personally yourself a personal relationship with god this mighty creator because let's let's read here and then we're going to read our promise in john 14. you okay you should be quiet at church saint john 1 1. in the beginning was the logos what was the logos the speech the light what we were talking about i'm getting hot you don't have to excuse me just a minute in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god so we have no problem seeing a form move over that began to create now remember as i've always said before all those old testament like dad was saying last sunday all the examples of the jehovah shamaw rafael that was in the old testament that showed up in a way god was trying to condescend to the people but we see here that almighty god that the same moses's revelation was that i met this burning bush and a man spoke to me out of that burning bush and that was jehovah then moses wasn't satisfied with that if moses revelation had been a few more years ahead of time when he saw him as a man remember he said now god i really want to see you now he saw what he saw the back part of a man walked by and brother brown said that was jesus christ in theophany form not to flesh jesus but the theophany form jesus walked by and moses then saw that it was a man all right but if moses would have had a revelation of that then at the burning bush he could have looked in that burning bush and he would have saw jesus christ right i just believe i mean there's just no other way to see it is that this cloud by day and pillar fire by night that's all israel had a revelation of was that this great jehovah god was this light or this fire or this angel even but if you could see him like we see him now because what happened to all that all that became jesus christ so but now remember god don't gain any attributes or gain any new form all those forms are in god he was just letting them out a little at a time this is how i'm going to appear to these people because they don't you know what the problem is understanding because god gave paul the new birth and said you must have the mind of christ yet paul didn't know anything about the seals son of man was not revealed to him like it was in the end time why he said i see through a glass darkly in other words his revelation wasn't progressed enough see but he's one of the greatest i mean he wrote 80 of the new testament so we're not degrading paul i'm not even degrading luther but luther just like i was telling them um in tennessee this weekend it we get tunnel vision luther's revelation of god was see i'm looking at sister rebecca and that's luther's revelation say that i'm looking right and that's all i can say so i can smoke a hey drink a beer and talk about god right but now that doesn't negate that when i do this that i see joyce and danny and hope and and tyler and and all the others you understand what i'm saying it doesn't mean they weren't sitting there to start with no this whole room is here but if you were to take this camera and just focus in on sister rebecca said well that's all i see right there there's just one woman sitting in this room and i'll describe her just like i see her that's what that's what luther's revelation of jesus christ was okay but that doesn't negate that all these other people are sitting out here it doesn't do away with them it's just luther had a vision of what god looked like right there's what he saw but now when wesley came what happened god just opened up the cube a little bit more and oh we don't need to smoke we shouldn't do that we shouldn't drink there was a consciousness brought to man it wasn't and that's the same way with god all right this is jehovah and this is all god is no that's all you see of god at that moment right this is all the attributes of god if he had ever how many of these 25 people sitting in the room if there's 25 attributes of god i just see one because of my limited vision but now as moses saw more of god he finally come to place he said god i want to see you like i've never seen you before so god said okay well now god didn't have to create a form that form was already there right same with with adam i believe adam if you were to ask adam show him a picture of jesus at about 20 years old and show him a a a picture of that god that adam walked in the cool the garden with he'll say that's the same man right melchizedek same thing melchizedek was jesus christ no other form you can't if brother danny was to pass on and come back in another form that'd be transmigrating souls or putting his soul in another form no he's gonna come back looking just like he is now because you can't do away with it that's the pattern or the impression that god made before the foundational world he made an impression in his mind of how you were going to look and that's why he could breed this one to this one this one to this one this one to this one this one this one this one this one and come right down to what you look like right now thank god no but see after paul after paul's age he saw a lot of god too but he didn't see all of god but now what happened down through the dark ages or down through time even even in martin's day in in in columbus and irenaeus's day we begin to narrow our thoughts of god down the roman catholic church started putting in the mind of the people hey you can't do this you can't do this god is not this god is just the church and that's all people saw right i didn't negate all the other things of god but they narrowed it down then when luther started luther started with that vision he come out of the catholic church right all right well that foundation began to grow back out again the bribery same thing but but let's look at it like in an envision you know this vision it didn't do away with all the attributes of god well back in the beginning it didn't do away with the attributes of god as being a healer savior redeemer drove a refund all the great all the ones manasses tisch tissue all the ones that dad's preaching about now it doesn't negate that they were there they were always there that's what i want you to understand about god god has never developed right he's always the same way that's why you can depend on him you and i developed brother brown said you know we started with a hut said now we live in a mansion we started with the two hor with the with the wheel the buggy the horse and buggy and he actually in his time he saw it literally come from riding a horse to an astronaut now that rocket was back in the 20s when brother branham was little and riding a horse right it took what man's intelligence to put the elements together brother brown said television was in the in the beginning in in adam you know back in why white dimensions people were flowing through dimensions uh just like you know the devil and and like brother joe was doing you know last sunday with the dimensions the dimensions were already there that's why i said there's no new thing in god it's all god's already got this thing if you see them from the beginning it's already done anyway exactly that's what i was telling them last sunday today if you had never met me before now this is what i understand about god and this is my i know a lot of you understand it but this is more for for the people on the internet here i stand today as i'll introduce myself to brother donnie as wade dale he says okay i know him as a human being right i know him as a human being now if someone walks in the door and i give him a big hug and a kiss and i say hey this is my wife june well now donny doesn't see a different person but he sees a different attribute now how did that attribute come out because she came on the scene not because i needed it for saying about god god doesn't need to gain attributes he always was a father son holy ghost but see i always was i'd been married to her for 31 years but if donnie just met me right she would manifest my title see but now now what happens now if none of you knew me but that little girl walked in that door a few minutes ago you'd know right quick one thing i was a grandpa now who developed that you and your mind me standing here no that little girl that walks in the door she identified me and that's what god's doing that's why god put people on the earth to identify him who else is going to identify god the animals can't they are god to me to me the animals when they say mother nature and nate to me nature is god that's god's simplest form he put those animals on the earth to do the same thing that they're doing now they have not changed like brother brown said he said they just have a spirit he said they have not changed a bird he said the same bird that built a nest in the garden of eden he said that same bird builds the same nest just like it was in the garden of eden he builds the same nest now all right but humans are not that way because he put an intelligence in us god's intelligence right all right so that form of god as the bible is unfolding we need to see god in our own life because we're the ones that's making him manifest i'm sorry you and i are the ones making them manifest all right so let's finish reading in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god the same was in the beginning with god in other words no change everything's the same right there all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and life with the light of men as the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not let's go on to verse nine because the other part is about john that was the true light capital so john is bringing see this little little light over here in verse four and five but he's developed after after john the baptist introduces this man we know who this man is because john was one to introduce him right that was the true life which light is every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of god power to become the sons of god that's what we're talking about see son of god though coming to in the end time he's going to be son of man so go ahead in verse nine that's the capital life that he separated from the court right right exactly that is the exact light we were talking about in the beginning that's exactly who that was because the light is every man that cometh into the world that's not the sunshine that's not the moon that's god's light the light of god all right he came unto his own and his own received him not verse 12. but as many as received him to them he gave gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name now what was the name of god jesus christ which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh that's what we were talking about this past weekend and we've talked about many times here not of the will of man that's your natural mom and dad because the will of man brought you here mother and father gets together and has you that's the will of man that's what the will of god god didn't want that to happen to start with see it says not of the will of man but of god so he's taking you and he's he's regening or regenerating he's making his generation come to light right so now let's go to isaiah 52 where i ask you to read and we got into it a little bit but let's we see that what god done who hath believed i recorded into whom is the arm of the lord revealed well you and i i hope and then that explains the flesh of god what happens in verse 2 through 7 8 9 and there 7. that was the flesh of god that was the that was the sacrifice that was the son of man that was the human man that was on earth to do it to do a duty to do a a job that he was required to do because of what what isaiah wrote see jesus didn't come any other way than what the old testament that's why that's why he said to him he said who can convince me of sin who can who can accuse me of of not keeping the law even and all the things they say oh you're not supposed to eat uh what was they was eating corn on somebody else's field or in the sabbath or whatever and he said hey he took him right back to their law and told him said you can do that right he said you don't buy herself he said but if a man lets you in his field unless he didn't eat your corn for free they didn't not eat on the sabbath like jesus was telling them he said he said we're just eating somebody's corn we didn't buy this we didn't break the law law says you know they eat on the sabbath day certain things they eat so they cooked it but they wasn't cooking corn they were just eating corn out of a man's field i would assume and with the bible and him being right the guy whoever the person was said hey eat my you know your passion through eat my field you know eat the corn in my field that's the bible that they left the left around for so what they did for sojourners like they did with ruth and and the story of ruth and boaz they left hands full of purpose they they left things he said hey leave them for the poor people as they pass by well there was no date that they couldn't do that right so jesus was all the time telling them hey in other words you're not really getting what i was saying in the old testament in other words you i was telling you this and here i am fulfilling it and you don't have a clue you know you're you're just saying hey you're not supposed to eat this you know he said no you can eat it if you don't pay for it right so if you go through free it don't matter you know you sit there and eat you want to try that today no i think somewhere it's evolved into there's nothing free in this there's nothing there's nothing free in this time i wrote the know that you can't do all that you're doing on free stuff but we thought hey that's a problem we all come free right you know what's wrong with that oh yeah his technicalities and that's what they were trying to get jesus on technicalities but he always took him right back to the same he'd say hey i'm not breaking the law show me he walked up there to him one day and he said show me what i've not done remember read in your bible every time there was a feast day there was three that was required of male jewish people boys three feasts you had to go to i can't remember but it was the feast of tabernacles feast of pentecost and one other he was always somewhere if you'll read in the bible it'll say when the day of the feast was come or when the first of the month well there was somewhere there was a feast jesus was always in that temple when that feast day came because he was the because he said he was the lord of the harvest he was the lord of the feast days he you wouldn't see him if he wrote the law you wouldn't he'd be a a very untrue god if he wrote that law and then he said told the disciples ah you ain't got he ain't got to worry about that i mean wha who would they believe oh let's just go over here and you know let's just don't even know he was always in the temp in the temple in the tabernacle somewhere around those feast days doing the things of god because he was god but now let's go down to verse eight he was taken from prison prison and from judgment and she who shall declare his generation question mark who shall declare the generation now isaiah isaiah 53 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare a generation isaiah saw this man from verse 1 through verse 7 like brother branham said just look like dog meat isaiah knew this man was going to be killed and there was no way that a human man can perpetuate his generation if he's dead have you ever thought about it like that he said who shall declare his generation because this great jehovah that isaiah is speaking of that's going to come down and take our transgression and our sins away he's going to die so who shall declare his generation just like adam it was adam abel and seth but but in your genealogy it goes from adam to seth why abel was cut off remember abel was the type of christ abel was cut off in his generation just like this scripture right here said because he was what killed before he had children so you take abel's abel has no genealogy remember we talked about that in the bible study um ryan asked the question about that why was abel not in the genealogy of adam well why he didn't have children cain killed him he was cut off and from the land of the living just like jesus christ was but what did the type of is you raise up seth showing the resurrection of jesus christ and then you had seth and enos and and mel and methuselah and you had a generation who shall declare this man's generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living no more genealogy for this guy isaiah said okay he's not married he's going to get killed how is this man going to do us any good if he's dead that's what he's asking the question who shall declare his genealogy so because his genealogy of jesus christ natural on the earth it did stop at calvary when that natural man died his natural genealogy ceased just speak plain he never had any relations with a woman like i don't care what the world says he never did that he didn't defile himself because he asked god he said sanctify this so that i can sanctify others so he he took his self out of the way right but see he's cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his flesh no his soul his soul that's why brother branham said you could have a court of jesus literal blood and be lost but if you ever get the life that's in that blood it'll give you eternal life what's the life in the blood the soul of man now you can't separate them because if you separate them the man dies just like jesus did his natural blood stopped in his body whatever was left in his body his natural blood ceased and that was it but the life that was in that blood came back three days later got back in that body of flesh and raised up right so the flesh of jesus right the flesh of jesus was the son of man the soul of jesus was the son of god everybody understand that the holy ghost or god in spirit form he said i come from god i come from god i go back to god because when he met paul he was back to that capital l-i-g-h-t right but he had picked up a flesh body that flesh body don't get me wrong that flesh body didn't save you the the flesh body of jesus it was him given his life that was in that body the soul of god that actually that's what i'm bringing to this point i want you to see this there's the soul of almighty god the real you remember brother brown said the real you well that right there that's you say well that's not the real god no that's the real god this is a real god but that's the real god this is the flesh of god but god had to come down in human flesh to be our brother that's why melchizedek could not die for your sins the flesh of melchizedek could not do you any good but now the soul that one that was melchizedek brother brown said became jesus christ because remember melchizedek couldn't be your brother he wasn't born right so he couldn't be your brother he could not be your brother because he was not born of a of a woman what he spoke that flesh into existence spoke it right out of existence that flesh couldn't couldn't take the stripes for your healing huh come on it couldn't do it god had to create a body which was him sorry it was him it was the body this was the body of god yet that body was there for your stripes was there for your healing was there read all those things wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity sure you couldn't separate the body from the soul just like me and you if you do one of them dies but that life that body in 72 hours would have rotted because the bible says lest that spirit comes back in that body within 72 hours remember remember what the psalms david saying he said i shall not leave his soul in what hell or suffer my holy one to seek corruption that body would have corrupted and rotted and blowed up and and deteriorated if that life of that man did not come back in that body and quicken it or change it right right just just another second then we'll start right back here next sunday yet it pleased the lord to bruise him when he had put into grief when he he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his regeneration he'll see his generation right there isaiah i believe he just had a hallelujah time because when god was revealing that to him and he was writing it down he was he was without hope up here at about verse 8. he said god how are you going to do this there's no generation you're going to bring up remember they love that genealogy in the old testament right there's no there's no genetic makeup on this earth it's going to it's going to do this oh but you're going to give your own life and that on your own life is what's going to do it see because he says right here he gave make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many three shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide this fallen strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death let's go back to genesis 3 15 that's when he promised that he would put his life in the womb of a woman and when that baby was born here the soul of almighty god would come down into human flesh and this is the culmination of it right here isaiah finally realizes we've got a chance right when he finishes isaiah 53 because look the very last verse there in 12 and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressor that's all daniel 9 24. that's right that whole isaiah 53 exactly six full purpose daniel might say that what does them in the in the uh after the tribulation or during the uh before the treatment or during the tribulation for us puts them in the rapture this right here is what's gonna put us in the rapture isaiah 53. so let's see isaiah 53 6 4 purpose daniel 9 isaiah 53 same identical thing but he gave his soul the very person of god now let's get on this next sunday god bless you thank you baby you did a good job you did good i love you they did a good job
