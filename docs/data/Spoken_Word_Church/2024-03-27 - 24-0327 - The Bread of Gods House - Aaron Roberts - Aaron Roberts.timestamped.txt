[6:59] he Hebrews 9 begin at verse one and it
[7:02] says then verily the first Covenant had
[7:05] also ordinances of divine service and a
[7:08] worldly Sanctuary for there was a
[7:10] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[7:13] the
[7:13] Candlestick and the table and the shoe
[7:16] bread which is called the sanctuary and
[7:19] after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[7:21] which is called the holiest of all which
[7:23] had the golden sensor and had the Ark of
[7:26] the Covenant overlaid roundabout with
[7:28] gold wherein was the golden pot that had
[7:30] mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the
[7:34] tables of the Covenant amen God bless
[7:36] you may be
[7:37] seated and uh I titled this tonight the
[7:41] bread of God's house and you know
[7:43] brother random talked about Bethlehem
[7:45] being the house of God's bread amen and
[7:47] I just uh was looking at some things and
[7:54] um as
[7:56] it
[7:57] approaching Easter and
[8:00] I'd spoke on communion a little little
[8:03] while back and uh in Sunday school and
[8:07] just kind of looking at a few things
[8:09] here and just kind of want to look at a
[8:12] few things in in regards to all of that
[8:16] and you know um this is from the message
[8:20] uh Israel in the church and brother Ram
[8:21] said he said Christ is in in all the Old
[8:25] Testament in all the Old Testament and
[8:28] he was talking about you go through
[8:29] everyone of the wat of the separation
[8:31] the red hepher all of the things that
[8:33] you go through everything he said how
[8:35] the hsip and the cedar wood all mixed in
[8:38] together how the hood how the wood and
[8:40] the Tabernacle how the Brazen altar the
[8:42] labor the shoe bread everything pointed
[8:44] to Christ in him and it says in him we
[8:47] are complete in Jesus Christ and so I
[8:51] want to look at a few things tonight
[8:52] because we know all the scripture talks
[8:55] about we see Jesus Christ in all the
[8:57] scripture the whole thing the the whole
[8:59] book is about Jesus Christ and we see
[9:02] Christ in every aspect of the scripture
[9:06] and we see how everything is in the Old
[9:09] Testament it types Jesus Christ and we
[9:11] know that when it comes to the New
[9:12] Testament we see Jesus Christ and we see
[9:15] the Life of Christ and and you know one
[9:17] of the things that brother bam mentions
[9:20] he said you know God gave us three
[9:22] ordinances there was three things that
[9:24] God showed for us to do and he said the
[9:26] first one was water baptism
[9:30] and he said he said the second one was
[9:32] communion and the third one is feet
[9:33] washing foot washing and you know and he
[9:36] he began to talk about those things and
[9:38] you know when you see those those three
[9:41] things that God give us to do as
[9:43] articles uh ordinances to do in the
[9:45] church you know you see the life and uh
[9:48] doing some reading you see the life of
[9:50] Jesus Christ in each one of those
[9:52] because you know you you look at the at
[9:56] at say at foot washing you know when you
[9:59] when you look at the aspect of of the
[10:01] foot washing you know brother brand said
[10:02] it was an act of humility yes and see
[10:05] you see the life of Jesus Christ you see
[10:08] you know the first thing that it takes
[10:10] it takes humility but it also it also
[10:13] takes it shows the servitude the heart
[10:17] of a servant it shows the heart of love
[10:19] for somebody to be able to do that and
[10:22] you know you you see how how Jesus
[10:25] wanted us to see his his life because
[10:29] you know in the in the old when Jesus
[10:33] came you know all of the through the Old
[10:35] Testament the Pharisees and and so many
[10:38] of the the religious leaders of the day
[10:40] and so many all they were looking for
[10:41] was a king and they were looking for the
[10:43] the Messiah and they were looking for
[10:44] all these things that was going to take
[10:46] place and yet when he came he came in
[10:48] such a way that they didn't recognize
[10:50] him they didn't see him because he
[10:52] didn't fit the mold he did not fit their
[10:54] idea what the scriptures
[10:56] said but see it was it was him coming
[10:59] him condescending to be to be in
[11:02] fellowship with us to walk the same life
[11:05] that we had to to go through the same
[11:07] things that we that we suffer the same
[11:10] Tri trials and tribulations the same
[11:12] struggles he went through the exact same
[11:14] thing because he went through all that
[11:16] that he can be our high priest that we
[11:18] can that he can suffer all of these
[11:19] things he knows how we feel but you know
[11:23] he he came to do that because he wanted
[11:25] to see how we live he wanted he wanted
[11:27] to be but he had to do that so that that
[11:29] he could be our propitiation to to be
[11:31] our sacrifice he had to come in the in
[11:34] the form of sinful flesh to be to be the
[11:37] one that would be the sacrifice to pay
[11:40] for our
[11:41] Redemption and you see how how he came
[11:44] and and so that was a aspect that we see
[11:47] how God wanted us to see how he lived
[11:50] but not so that we see how he how he
[11:53] lived and even in you know when when it
[11:55] comes to the communion table and you
[11:57] know and he begins to talk about all
[11:58] these things that he tells you you I'm
[12:01] your master and Lord you say that I am
[12:04] because I am but he said you've seen
[12:06] that I'm your master and Lord and I've
[12:08] done these things he said you ought to
[12:10] do these things to one another because
[12:11] I've washed your feet you ought to wash
[12:14] one another's feet and you know because
[12:16] we see how he descended and he came down
[12:19] but he could but he could lower himself
[12:21] because when you look at as brother
[12:22] brandom said when you look at the time
[12:24] and the and the hour and the days in
[12:26] which he lived you know that was one of
[12:28] the worst jobs that you could have I
[12:30] mean it was it was the worst of the
[12:32] worst the lowest jobs that anybody could
[12:34] have was to be a footwash flunky I mean
[12:38] you know if you had that when you didn't
[12:39] have any social social status right you
[12:43] know I mean that was that was a job some
[12:45] people probably didn't want to tell
[12:46] anybody I I watch people's feet right
[12:50] yeah I mean it was it's the the in the
[12:52] time that they live nobody wanted to do
[12:54] that job even I mean probably the low
[12:57] even of all the servants and all the
[12:59] slaves that was probably put on the
[13:00] lowest one in the bunch right they had
[13:03] to do that
[13:05] job but the king of glory came and
[13:09] condescended to do that job for us to
[13:13] show us this is this is an act of
[13:16] servitude and so it doesn't matter who
[13:18] we are who we think we are we it's it's
[13:22] to be as low as brother R said to be as
[13:24] humble as we can be see how low you can
[13:27] live he said because the more humble you
[13:30] are the closer you are to God the closer
[13:32] you can get to God so we see how living
[13:36] living in this realm to be as humble as
[13:39] we can do and and so to follow these
[13:42] ordinances that God give us to do and we
[13:44] we see that when it comes to um you know
[13:48] foot washing and then uh
[13:51] communion here here's the communion when
[13:54] you're there and you know uh taking
[13:57] taking the bread
[14:00] and and you see how we we take the bread
[14:02] and we break the bread amen and you know
[14:06] Jesus sitting there expounding to the
[14:10] disciples he said he said this is my
[14:12] body that is broken for
[14:15] you see you know and everybody says well
[14:18] you know the Eucharist you know the the
[14:20] Catholics believe that this becomes the
[14:22] literal body yeah and it's like well the
[14:24] literal body when you read the scripture
[14:27] the literal body was in front of them
[14:29] and the literal body was what was
[14:30] talking to
[14:32] them the bread that he gave them was not
[14:35] was not his
[14:37] body but he said you do this in
[14:40] remembrance of
[14:41] me so it wasn't a literal thing but he
[14:44] was showing this is what you're supposed
[14:46] to be doing right because when you when
[14:49] you take of that it's it's communion
[14:52] it's Fellowship because that's exactly
[14:55] what he was doing when he set forth for
[14:57] them to go into the room and him stay
[15:00] there and he began to talk to them and
[15:03] he began to talk to them about what was
[15:05] going to take place because we know that
[15:08] they was here in this in the first Upper
[15:10] Room you know here they are and and
[15:12] they're very sad because he begins to
[15:14] talk about all the things that's going
[15:15] to take place and they're they're very
[15:17] un uh unsure of what's going to take
[15:19] place in the future because they don't
[15:21] understand but he begins to try to
[15:23] expound to them and tell them listen
[15:25] this is what's going to take place but
[15:27] don't you worry because I've prayed for
[15:29] you and that all these things will work
[15:31] out because it's according to God's plan
[15:33] they didn't understand that but he but
[15:35] he began to explain that to them but he
[15:38] wanted them to understand that through
[15:39] this you're eating my body but all at
[15:42] one day the spirit will come but there
[15:45] at the table he gave them the bread and
[15:47] said you eat this is my body and he said
[15:49] this is and gave them the wine this is
[15:51] my blood that you drink but uh one day
[15:54] that the that the spirit would come and
[15:56] it would Quicken the word that they held
[15:58] but he is explaining that to him listen
[16:00] to give them encouragement to understand
[16:02] hey this is what's going to take place
[16:04] but they didn't understand that but he
[16:06] also knew that they didn't understand
[16:08] but he began just to tell them don't
[16:10] worry about it because when he began to
[16:12] tell them about what was going to take
[16:14] place in that upper room and he began to
[16:16] tell them all the things that was going
[16:17] they were going to face in the upper
[16:19] that that upper room they didn't
[16:21] understand what was going to take place
[16:23] but you know when he told Peter listen
[16:25] you're going to deny me and all these
[16:26] things are going to take place but you
[16:27] know don't worry I've pray for you amen
[16:30] prise the Lord he didn't turn Peter away
[16:32] because he kept telling Peter listen
[16:34] this is what you're going to go
[16:36] through see he already knows what we go
[16:39] through and he all and many times the
[16:41] Lord has told us and we sometimes we
[16:43] don't listen amen that's right the Lord
[16:47] tells you ahead of time what not to do
[16:49] or what's going to happen right we just
[16:52] like Peter sometimes we're too Den for
[16:54] it to catch you know for it to land in
[16:57] the Amen in our grave matter for it to
[16:59] actually
[17:00] work because sometimes we don't want we
[17:03] don't want to listen to what God has to
[17:04] say because we don't want to have to go
[17:06] through
[17:07] it because you know what it's it's not
[17:09] it's not a pretty sight it's not going
[17:10] to be it's not going to be what we want
[17:12] to
[17:13] face but it's what we need amen amen
[17:16] that's right but see after they go
[17:19] through all of that in that upper room
[17:20] and he begins to fellowship with them
[17:22] commune with them tell them see here
[17:25] they are in in this one upper room and
[17:27] they don't know what's going to take
[17:28] place but you know what when he ra
[17:30] raises from the dead and he goes and he
[17:32] tells them he said he tells the the
[17:34] women whe at the grave he tells them to
[17:36] go tell my disciples that I will meet
[17:38] them in Jerusalem Y and so they go and
[17:43] then he tells them when when he goes to
[17:44] ascend because he comes back and he
[17:46] begins to expound exactly what took
[17:48] place he told him he said listen I told
[17:51] you tear this Temple down three days
[17:53] I'll raise it up again it's exactly what
[17:54] took place and when he began to explain
[17:57] all these things because began to tell
[17:59] them about the kingdom of God being a
[18:01] spiritual Kingdom and then they still
[18:03] stood there and say well is this time
[18:05] you going to be defeat the Romans are
[18:06] you going to take over the world
[18:08] now no man do you remember what I told
[18:12] pilot I told pilate that if my kingdom
[18:14] was of this world my followers were figh
[18:16] but we didn't fight why because I know
[18:20] what pilot doesn't know is that one day
[18:22] all of this will be mine I will have I
[18:24] will have dominion over this all one day
[18:26] we just got to allow the the plan of God
[18:29] take place because I don't have to worry
[18:31] about fighting because I've already all
[18:32] got it under control the father already
[18:34] has it under control and he already has
[18:36] a plan laid out and all we got to do is
[18:39] walk through
[18:40] it what do we have to do all we have to
[18:43] do is like Jesus done we've got to die
[18:45] to oursel and not have our own will but
[18:48] to have not my will but thine be done
[18:51] and if we allow the the plan of God to
[18:53] take place then you know what it'll all
[18:54] work out exactly to the glory of
[18:57] God
[18:59] and so as we see then what did he do he
[19:01] told him he said Terry in Jerusalem till
[19:03] you be in dued with power from on high
[19:05] am so all here they are in one Upper
[19:08] Room meeting with Jesus and being unsure
[19:12] of what was going to take place and here
[19:13] they are coming into another Upper Room
[19:16] unsure what's going to take
[19:18] place and even when brother brenon
[19:20] begins to talk about them being in that
[19:22] upper room and here they are and they
[19:23] say well do you think we got
[19:26] it and he's like well I think we've been
[19:29] up here long enough I think we probably
[19:30] got
[19:31] it and it's like no you
[19:34] T until until you be ued yes until you
[19:38] be filled with overflowing with until
[19:42] you know something's taking place until
[19:44] you be ued with with power from on high
[19:48] until something takes
[19:54] place as brother Wade always talks about
[19:57] you know he don't wouldn't get in that
[19:59] electrical panel cuz he don't understand
[20:01] those
[20:02] things but let me tell you something all
[20:04] you got to do is get in that panel and
[20:06] get some wires crossed and all of a
[20:09] sudden you'll see things you've never
[20:10] seen
[20:14] before I watched a man working on a on a
[20:16] floor scrubber one time and he got a
[20:18] screwdriver
[20:20] uninsulated he got across the terminals
[20:23] the next thing you know we all seeing
[20:26] lights he just about melted that
[20:28] screwdriver in
[20:30] half why because there's power there and
[20:34] you know what something took place amen
[20:38] and it's just like you stick your hand
[20:39] on
[20:42] something you know when I was a kid no
[20:45] Richard Richard always says well I
[20:47] always tell stories on him so I'm gonna
[20:48] tell a story on
[20:50] me write this in your
[20:54] book I was a kid I said I was standing I
[20:57] was standing on the couch so you can
[21:01] tell I was I was little yes I was very
[21:03] young standing on the couch
[21:07] um that's how like Dad always said I
[21:10] never was little I was just young so
[21:12] when I was younger I was standing on the
[21:14] couch but I was looking inside of a
[21:17] lamp and there was no light bulb in the
[21:21] lamp and I did not know what I was
[21:23] looking
[21:24] at and I was that's neat and there's
[21:28] that little PL
[21:29] little thing down in the middle of that
[21:31] light socket I like hey what does this
[21:33] do guess what won't do that
[21:36] again I didn't understand the laws of
[21:39] electricity but let me tell you what I
[21:41] got in contact with
[21:43] it and that's what I don't have to do
[21:45] that no more I know how that
[21:48] is well and that's the same way with the
[21:50] power of God you don't have to know all
[21:52] the ins and outs of it but let me tell
[21:54] you when you ever get a hold of it when
[21:56] it ever crosses you when it gets inside
[22:00] of you you don't have to have somebody
[22:02] tell you you got
[22:04] it because it's all it it has it takes
[22:07] something takes place you know somebody
[22:09] didn't have to tell me that electricity
[22:11] was real I got all I wanted that
[22:15] day and it's the same way with the power
[22:18] of God when you he said carry until you
[22:21] be ued with power from on high when they
[22:24] were in that upper room and they were in
[22:26] a place where they were unsure of what
[22:28] was going to they were uncertain in
[22:30] their walk they were unsure what was
[22:31] going to take place all they had seen
[22:33] was Jesus had ascended and they went and
[22:35] and stood in this room and they were
[22:37] afraid of what was going to take place
[22:39] but all of a sudden that time when the
[22:41] rushing Mighty Wind came in and he be
[22:44] began to break up in clothing tongues of
[22:46] fire and it began to settle upon all of
[22:48] them and they began to act like they
[22:49] were drunk and all of a sudden they had
[22:52] a new way of looking at things and the
[22:53] new way of acting and they didn't they
[22:55] didn't care what anybody thought of them
[22:57] or what anybody said because all of a
[22:59] sudden they open the doors and here they
[23:00] go right
[23:03] outside hey people wonder who are these
[23:05] crazy people coming out the door in the
[23:08] middle of the
[23:10] day but you know what Peter began to
[23:12] talk and he said listen stood up with
[23:15] the 11 and and the scripture says you
[23:17] know he said these are not drunk like
[23:19] you
[23:20] suppose but this is that which was
[23:22] spoken of by the prophet Joel that I
[23:25] will pour out my
[23:27] spirit amen and when the when the
[23:30] outpouring of the spirit then they began
[23:32] to Proclaim exactly what Jesus had said
[23:35] and began to talk about who Jesus Christ
[23:38] was and what the word was and a
[23:40] fulfillment of the word for their
[23:44] day and they begin to understand all of
[23:47] those all those different languages all
[23:49] those different countries they begin to
[23:51] understand in their own language and
[23:52] their own tongues exactly what the word
[23:54] of God was for their day and see that's
[23:57] exactly what it takes place when you
[23:59] when you get into that and so that's
[24:02] exactly what it has to do and so when
[24:04] you see these things brother R said when
[24:06] you when you've had that experience see
[24:08] then you can come to this table and
[24:10] begin to eat of this bread because it is
[24:12] showing that you've overcome something
[24:15] not just anybody can eat of this bread
[24:16] because it's for the Overcomers it's for
[24:19] the
[24:21] Christians because it is showing
[24:23] something that's taking
[24:25] place and so you eat of this bread
[24:30] and then the other one is is he and he
[24:32] says because of of eating eating the
[24:35] bread he said when you know this is my
[24:37] body you eat and he said he said because
[24:39] he said you sh the Lord's death till he
[24:41] comes and so we understand that through
[24:44] through foot washing we can see the life
[24:46] of Jesus Christ and then we commemorate
[24:48] his death through the communion eating
[24:50] the bread and we see how it it
[24:52] commemorates his his death but we also
[24:56] when it comes to baptism we understand
[24:58] that baptism is you know to understand
[25:01] the baptism speaking of of being
[25:06] baptized and understanding that that you
[25:08] had something to take place in your life
[25:10] that you follow in the ordinance of God
[25:14] he said he said repent and be baptized
[25:16] in in the name of Jesus Christ he said
[25:19] for the remission of sins why because
[25:21] you've had something to take place right
[25:25] why because it's the goodness of God
[25:26] that leads you to repentance but when
[25:28] you come to that place just as as Philip
[25:30] was speaking to the Ethiopian unic when
[25:32] he began to speak the word to him you
[25:34] know when he began to understand what
[25:35] the scriptures said understanding what
[25:38] Isaiah had written in all the scriptures
[25:39] as he began to expound and he began to
[25:41] see those things and he said here's
[25:43] water what hinder me from being baptized
[25:46] why because when he began to see the
[25:48] truth you know what it led him right to
[25:49] the
[25:51] water and it's the same thing baptism
[25:54] when you see something that's taking
[25:55] place in your life then go to the water
[25:59] right well is is is baptism essential
[26:03] yes well let me tell you
[26:05] something you know because you know what
[26:07] we're not all just like the thief on the
[26:09] cross and you know he didn't have no
[26:10] chance to do anything or other people
[26:12] living on their or having a deathbed
[26:14] confession that's somebody that's
[26:15] somebody else's experience but let me
[26:17] tell you you can't walk and talk and and
[26:19] come to church and everything like that
[26:21] and never be baptized you can't walk and
[26:23] talk and live a life and expect expect
[26:27] to have what you need and claim to be a
[26:30] part of Jesus Christ when you've never
[26:32] been to the water and been baptized
[26:34] because if you if God has dealt with
[26:36] your heart and he's brought you to an
[26:38] altar or a bedside or a closet or
[26:40] wherever or a tree stump if he's ever
[26:42] brought you to that place and he's
[26:43] changed your life and he started to lead
[26:45] you then you know what the first thing
[26:46] he's going to do is lead you to water
[26:49] baptism am because you know it's the
[26:52] same one that led us that called us out
[26:54] of the gutter and out of the worst
[26:56] places that we've ever been because out
[26:58] of all the darkness in the world and
[27:00] when he's brought you into his light and
[27:01] he begins to put you on the road and you
[27:03] start walking this narrow way when he
[27:06] put you on the path of righteousness
[27:09] he's going to lead you right to the
[27:10] water amen no doubt
[27:16] amen and
[27:18] so you know it's it's where everybody
[27:21] tries to you know that they always try
[27:23] to find loopholes for
[27:26] everything well the thing is is how
[27:28] close do you want to get to
[27:34] God many
[27:36] times see it shows us there's not been a
[27:39] true conversion that's right amen if if
[27:42] you can't if you can't come the way God
[27:44] has prescribed it for for us to come
[27:47] then it shows that there's not been a
[27:49] real heart
[27:51] change because if God's changed your
[27:53] heart then you know you want you want to
[27:55] get as close to God as you can that's
[27:57] right right you know brother I'm telling
[27:59] the story about I believe it was the man
[28:01] that was running the buckboards or the
[28:03] stage coach or whatever it was and you
[28:05] know he want know how close everybody
[28:06] could get to the edge and it's like well
[28:08] you know I get so close I get so close
[28:10] and the other guy's like I'm scraping
[28:12] the
[28:13] wall and he's like that's the guy I
[28:16] want I don't want somebody trying to run
[28:18] on three wheels one of them hanging off
[28:20] the cliff you know no I want to see how
[28:23] how many people can stay in the road
[28:25] keep all four wheels on the ground
[28:29] because you know it's everybody well
[28:31] let's just say how close we can get well
[28:34] you know it's like well I just stay
[28:36] right on the
[28:37] edge get right on the edge well you know
[28:39] what sooner or
[28:42] later everybody well I you know I I you
[28:46] know I just the Lord knows my heart and
[28:50] you know I just I just like you know
[28:52] just like this and
[28:54] that well listen anytime you get get in
[28:56] your mind get the mentality you know we
[28:58] just want to try to see how far we can
[29:00] get on the cliff and hang off and you
[29:04] know the devil be right behind you and
[29:06] he'll
[29:08] just give you a little nudge
[29:12] amen just come on just come on over just
[29:14] hang out a little more a little more a
[29:16] little
[29:17] more and then he'll just give you a
[29:19] nudge and then you're off amen so Lord
[29:22] why did this
[29:24] happen well you got yourself in a bad
[29:26] situation to begin with that's it
[29:29] but see God wants us to follow the
[29:32] ordinances that he's placed in the
[29:34] scripture he wanted us to follow these
[29:36] and if we can see the death
[29:39] burial and through
[29:41] baptism Romans tells us that through
[29:44] baptism we are buried in the likeness we
[29:47] are raised in the likeness of his
[29:49] resurrection amen so if we if we go
[29:53] through the ordinances that God has
[29:55] placed we can see the Life of Christ we
[29:58] can see his death but we can also see
[30:00] the resurrection and and so we see each
[30:02] one of these things has an important
[30:04] aspect of what God wants us to do not
[30:06] just something that we go through it's
[30:07] not just some kind of motion it's not
[30:10] just some act that we do right but it
[30:13] has a significance
[30:15] amen and so God wants us to do each one
[30:18] of those things Amen to follow
[30:23] him see he wants us to see the the life
[30:27] and the work that he has
[30:30] done brother ra says he says as he is
[30:33] here on Earth we see some of his
[30:36] work and he said it was meant is meant
[30:39] in Christian
[30:41] faith he said he is here the stream of
[30:43] all Christianity the head the beginning
[30:45] the origin of the Christian faith was
[30:47] Jesus Christ God's son the beginning of
[30:49] Christian faith the starting point for
[30:52] all mankind of all ages to look at that
[30:55] starting place and begin from there he
[30:57] was an example to
[31:00] us so we understand that you know
[31:05] Jesus when you look at the scripture you
[31:08] know even
[31:09] Jesus because he had to fulfill what was
[31:12] written in the Old Testament that even
[31:15] Jesus when he came to John in the River
[31:19] Jordan you know he come to John and John
[31:24] said Lord I need to be baptized of
[31:26] Thee
[31:29] and Jesus will suffer it to be so but we
[31:32] must fulfill all righteousness because
[31:34] the law said that the sacrifice must be
[31:37] washed and he came to the prophet to be
[31:39] washed to be baptized because that was
[31:41] scriptural for him to take place so if
[31:44] it was if it was important for us if it
[31:47] was important to him then it's important
[31:49] for us so is script is baptism an
[31:53] essential thing well if you're still
[31:55] walking and talking and still living
[31:57] then yes baptism is an important
[32:00] essential thing for you to do if Jesus
[32:03] was on the earth and he done it if Jesus
[32:05] could get down and wash the disciples
[32:08] feet if he could wash their feet if he
[32:11] could take communion and break bread
[32:14] with his
[32:16] disciples then if it's if it's important
[32:18] to him then it's important to us then
[32:21] then when he began when Paul began to
[32:23] talk about the the widows and the
[32:25] different ones you know they had to been
[32:27] able to to take the communion because
[32:29] every time they gathered they were
[32:30] taking communion but it also said they
[32:33] had to be the ones that were in the
[32:35] church that wash the Saints feet is an
[32:38] essential thing for us to do each one of
[32:40] those things is essential for our uh
[32:43] Christian walk because if he done it if
[32:46] he's our example then all the things
[32:48] that he done is exactly the things that
[32:50] we ought to do and so we see these
[32:52] things as very as very essential and if
[32:55] he would wash their feet because he is
[32:58] our pattern an example of Christianity
[33:01] then we ought to do the exact same thing
[33:04] we ought to wash one another's feet amen
[33:07] now when it comes to uh the the
[33:10] communion and and looking here it said
[33:14] uh the bread of God's house and I I
[33:17] wanted to kind of explain that t tonight
[33:20] and um just kind of something that's
[33:22] been on my heart but you know to
[33:25] understand why we do these things it's
[33:27] such an essential part not just not just
[33:30] the the communion and and that but every
[33:33] one of those ordinances has an essential
[33:35] aspect there's there's so much more that
[33:37] that it means to you when you go through
[33:40] those
[33:41] things and what a wonderful thing when
[33:43] you see
[33:44] somebody when they' when they've been
[33:47] out in sin and you see somebody go to
[33:50] the
[33:52] water when you see somebody that that
[33:55] has struggled in our in their life and
[33:57] you see all what God has done in their
[33:59] life and they go to the water to be
[34:00] baptized and they and God begins to lead
[34:04] them that way and all of a sudden you
[34:05] know you see God changed their life and
[34:08] you know it's a real testimony amen it's
[34:10] a real testament to God's power of what
[34:13] he's done and it's so essential if
[34:15] you've not been baptized it's such an
[34:17] essential
[34:19] thing I you know I I pray that everyone
[34:22] that's if you've not ever been baptized
[34:24] I pray God touch your heart that you get
[34:26] baptized I thank
[34:28] [Applause]
[34:30] God I I thank God that we've had so many
[34:33] baptisms in this
[34:35] church people have drove down their
[34:37] stakes and they and they have give the
[34:39] devil a black
[34:40] eye and you know if if you've been
[34:43] baptized before and you want to get
[34:44] baptized again amen if you feel like
[34:47] being baptized again I say get baptized
[34:50] again amen until you get until you get
[34:53] the assurance and you get to play to the
[34:55] place where you feel led that you need
[34:57] to be it's it's an essential thing
[35:00] brother I would I wouldn't hold nothing
[35:02] back and I wouldn't have no reservations
[35:05] or concerns or worries about anything
[35:08] amen I wouldn't I wouldn't give the
[35:10] devil no place s
[35:13] amen
[35:16] but I want to look here tonight and when
[35:20] you when you look at the at the
[35:22] communion and and one of the things I
[35:24] was looking at was the
[35:26] um the uh the bread and I read this
[35:30] scripture out of Hebrews because it's
[35:32] the one scripture that that U I was
[35:35] reading you know the one scripture that
[35:36] talks about the shoe bread and the Mana
[35:40] both of those being in the in the house
[35:42] of God and so you know when you when you
[35:46] see the the type of of what the
[35:49] communion is and understanding because
[35:51] we know brother Ram said that communion
[35:53] was fellowship and you brother Ram said
[35:55] one time that communion was like an
[35:57] oasis in the desert you know to have
[35:59] communion with God and and to fellowship
[36:02] with God and and so we see that it's a
[36:04] fellowship that we
[36:06] have and so it's it's an essential thing
[36:08] but when it when it talks about the shoe
[36:12] bread you know the shoe bread was on the
[36:15] was in the sanctuary was in the first or
[36:18] in the
[36:19] second Veil right as as you would think
[36:22] from the first coming into the second
[36:24] one from the outside coming in where the
[36:26] sanctuary is and so the table's there
[36:29] it's not in the Holy the holiest place
[36:31] but in there where the where the
[36:32] Candlestick and all that is but when you
[36:34] see that the the the bread was there and
[36:38] you you look back over the through the
[36:40] scripture and you see that how the the
[36:42] scripture talks about the the different
[36:45] um the different breads and you know the
[36:48] first time we see um them talking about
[36:51] the the bread that was uh God had given
[36:54] them a commandment was when they were
[36:56] coming out of Egypt and he begins to
[36:58] talk about the bread and you know he
[37:01] talks about them taking the lamb and the
[37:03] lamb because when he said when they got
[37:05] ready to leave uh Egypt he tells them he
[37:08] said listen he said the the Death Angel
[37:11] is coming and he said all the firstborn
[37:13] both man and Beast will die in Egypt
[37:15] tonight but he gave them the he gave
[37:18] them the promise he gave them the shity
[37:20] he said you take a lamb for your family
[37:22] and he said you take the blood of a lamb
[37:25] with no blemish in it and take this lamb
[37:28] and you take the blood and you roast it
[37:31] all with with the the the inals and
[37:35] everything and he said you put all that
[37:37] together and you're roasting that and
[37:39] you know that that I I've never imagined
[37:42] that being a wonderful smell I mean lamb
[37:44] and lots of things might might smell
[37:46] really good roasting but uh having all
[37:48] the inals in it's probably not the most
[37:50] aromatic thing that you want but when he
[37:53] take all that together right and you
[37:56] take this blood and you put it on the
[37:57] doorpost in the lentil and you get ready
[38:00] and you eat that with your shoes on and
[38:03] your staff in your hand ready to leave
[38:05] Egypt and he said you eat this Lamb with
[38:09] unleavened bread and he said you eat it
[38:12] with bitter
[38:14] herbs why because you're going through
[38:17] something that's not pleasant that's
[38:19] right and so because all of this is is a
[38:22] struggle this is this all but when you
[38:24] see what's going to take place so you
[38:27] know we
[38:43] [Music]
[39:16] [Music]
[39:27] even the bread that they ate was
[39:29] unleavened meaning that there was
[39:31] nothing mixed with the bread it was just
[39:33] the the meal and the water there's
[39:35] nothing else added into that it's just
[39:39] flat right and you know many times
[39:41] that's way brother brandom said you know
[39:42] when he got up and started preaching
[39:44] he's like well I'm just going to be
[39:46] flat he's just going to be plain why
[39:49] because that's exactly the way you got
[39:51] to be amen because there's no there's no
[39:53] mixing with that and as Jesus talked
[39:56] about Le the leaven being
[39:59] sin and and the ideas of the of the
[40:01] Pharisees he said don't have anything to
[40:03] do with the that
[40:05] leaven you do away with all of that it's
[40:08] just straight bread amen and so they eat
[40:10] this leaven this unleavened bread when
[40:12] they were going out because there was
[40:14] judgment in the land and they had to
[40:16] prepare themselves and so they ate
[40:18] unleavened bread so when you see them
[40:21] eating this eating this Lo unleavened
[40:23] bread going out when they were being
[40:25] delivered and then when later on when he
[40:27] tells them listen when you commemorate
[40:29] eating the lamb when you come out of
[40:31] Egypt even then you still you don't eat
[40:35] leaven bread right and then he said when
[40:38] you prepare for the Passover because
[40:40] when when he talks about in the feast
[40:41] days when he when you go in there and
[40:43] you come to this time and you're
[40:44] preparing for the the Passover to eat
[40:47] the lamb he said you don't even have it
[40:49] for another seven
[40:51] days you make sure you don't even have
[40:53] leaven in your house right brother you
[40:56] got to search and get get rid of
[40:58] everything yes sir anything that's
[41:00] contrary to the word anything contrary
[41:03] to this why because there's no trace of
[41:06] it
[41:07] anywhere so we get rid of all this so we
[41:09] have unleavened bread so when we're
[41:12] eating this unleavened bread then we see
[41:14] that he continues on here we are eating
[41:16] this unleavened
[41:18] bread and then when it comes to the time
[41:21] of them eating the shoe bread when
[41:24] they're making the shoe bread that goes
[41:25] in front of the in to the uh holy place
[41:29] when when they make this then there is
[41:31] no leaven they're following the same
[41:34] pattern of making this unleavened bread
[41:37] right but the scripture tells us that he
[41:40] says you would uh in in Leviticus he
[41:42] says you take fine flour and bake 12
[41:44] cakes thereof and then he says in two1
[41:47] deals shall be one
[41:50] cake he said you make two rows six in a
[41:52] row upon the pure table before the Lord
[41:56] so we know that those six in each roow
[41:59] so there's 12 cakes that are made and we
[42:01] know those 12 cakes represent the 12
[42:03] tribes of Israel and they sit before the
[42:06] Lord that's right and the scripture
[42:08] tells us that we know that they are made
[42:10] every every Sabbath they were changed so
[42:14] because so they those 12 cakes set in
[42:17] front of the Lord in the in the Holy
[42:19] place for a whole week and the next
[42:21] Sabbath they were taken out and 12 more
[42:24] were placed before the Lord now the name
[42:26] of of the SHO bread is called the bread
[42:29] of his presence because it's bread that
[42:32] sits before him all the time because you
[42:34] know you see how the scripture says that
[42:37] Jesus said in in and believe it's in
[42:39] Matthew he said I am the bread of life
[42:42] so there was always bread sitting but in
[42:44] the presence of God for them to have and
[42:46] we know that when that pres when that
[42:48] time ran out in the the uh the week was
[42:52] over with and it was changed out then
[42:54] the priesthood could eat that bread amen
[42:56] that's right the bread was a was given
[42:58] to the priesthood then they were able to
[43:00] eat that but they had to eat it in a
[43:02] holy place but that was always before
[43:04] the Lord for them to always eat that and
[43:06] so they were always eating that and it
[43:08] was always a continual uh Covenant
[43:11] before God that he was always with them
[43:14] and it was always before them that he
[43:16] was always a their sustainer that's
[43:19] right amen every trib was before the
[43:21] Lord in his presence all the time amen
[43:24] and so it shows that when God wants us
[43:27] to understand that that's where he wants
[43:29] us to be for us to be in his presence
[43:31] and if you get in his presence then
[43:33] there's always bread to eat there's
[43:35] always a fulfillment because he always
[43:37] wants you to eat there's always
[43:39] something for you to take place all you
[43:40] got to do is get In God's Presence he's
[43:43] all because you're always in because
[43:45] you're always before him you're his
[43:47] children because he always had the bread
[43:49] representing the children of Israel
[43:51] before him at all times right and it's
[43:55] the same thing so it's you're always for
[43:57] the Lord he always has something for you
[43:59] he's always leading you he's always
[44:00] guiding you he always has something for
[44:02] you but he wants you to realize that
[44:04] you're always
[44:06] there that you know even even when David
[44:09] talks about you know he's written in the
[44:11] that he was written our names were
[44:13] written in the palm of his hands you
[44:14] know when you see all these things that
[44:16] you know he could never forget us
[44:19] brother that God has something for you
[44:23] amen
[44:24] right see we see how how this the shoe
[44:27] bread was laid out and and brother Brown
[44:29] begins to talk about how the Sho bread
[44:32] and and all the different types how the
[44:34] Sho bread lays out and and you know um
[44:37] one of the things that brother Bram
[44:38] talks about the shoe bread and he begins
[44:40] to talk about the
[44:43] Passover and you know when he talks
[44:45] about the shoe bread coming into the
[44:47] Passover and you know and the Jew the
[44:49] Jews always make three brother Bram
[44:51] talks about this a couple of times he he
[44:53] says you know when you see that he said
[44:55] the Jews never understood why they had
[44:57] three loaves of
[44:59] bread when they when they go to do the
[45:01] Passover there was three loaves there
[45:04] and he said they still don't understand
[45:05] why there's three loaves because he said
[45:08] the first one is when they start when
[45:10] they start the the Passover they make a
[45:12] they make a blessing on everything and
[45:15] that's over the first bread which is the
[45:17] highest bread the highest ranking bread
[45:19] and then there's a middle piece and then
[45:21] the lowest one is at the end of the of
[45:24] the meal end of the Passover and they
[45:26] bless the one at the end which is the
[45:29] lowest of the three but the middle one
[45:32] they said they never understood why that
[45:34] middle one was there but the middle one
[45:36] is always broken right amen it's all the
[45:39] middle one is always broken and brother
[45:41] R said they still don't understand even
[45:43] when you read the uh even you read some
[45:46] of the Jewish Scholars they don't
[45:47] understand why but they have they have
[45:49] their different ideas of why they why
[45:51] they do that one of the things they
[45:54] always talk about is that the uh they
[45:57] always talk about that when you go into
[45:59] a blessing and you have this meal you
[46:01] always because Jesus and even even God
[46:05] told in the Old Testament he said you
[46:08] always have the poor the poor you have
[46:10] with you always and he said you never
[46:13] forget the poor and so and he said you
[46:15] never forget the hungry so they always
[46:17] set aside bread and so there's this
[46:20] bread that's broken and they always say
[46:22] because in their in their blessing is
[46:25] God has blessed us and we are here
[46:26] eating this Passover but there's those
[46:28] that don't and so you know and brother
[46:31] brand always when you read brother
[46:32] Brandon when he begins to talk about
[46:34] this when this bread is broken he said
[46:36] that was the type of Jesus Christ being
[46:38] broken and he said because the middle
[46:41] wall partition is torn down and he said
[46:43] that's exactly because there was God
[46:46] which is the first bread which is the
[46:48] highest bread and he said you and I are
[46:50] that last piece because we're at the end
[46:52] we're are the lowest but we have to have
[46:54] one a mediator between God and man amen
[46:58] and the one that has to be the mediator
[47:01] between God and man is the one that's
[47:03] broken amen and so when you see how they
[47:07] talk about that broken and they said
[47:09] they don't even understand that right
[47:12] but when we come to the communion
[47:15] table that's what a Moses when you come
[47:17] to the communion table and here's this
[47:21] bread and you stand here and and you and
[47:24] we pray over and we bless this bread and
[47:26] we break it why because he was broken
[47:29] for us why because we had to have
[47:32] somebody to be in that place we had to
[47:34] have a propitiation we had to have a
[47:36] mediator we had to have had one to stand
[47:39] that could break down all the barriers
[47:41] to bridge that Chasm between God and us
[47:45] because there was no one else but there
[47:46] had to be one that he stepped down from
[47:50] from the highest of highs to step into
[47:52] this place as the scripture says he was
[47:55] made a little lower than the Angels but
[47:57] came into this place and he was broken
[47:59] for us to bridge that Gap and what does
[48:02] the scripture say in Isaiah that you
[48:04] know and uh um Isaiah you know he he
[48:07] said you know because
[48:08] uh you know I've been
[48:12] anointed to preach to the
[48:15] poor and what did it say when when they
[48:17] break that bread in the middle what what
[48:19] did it say we're recognizing the poor
[48:21] who came to the poor who was who was the
[48:24] one that brought Good Tidings to the
[48:26] poor to to the meek who was that Jesus
[48:29] Christ all of those things that it talks
[48:31] about he was the perfect example of that
[48:33] shoe bread being broken in the middle
[48:37] amen and so we see how all these things
[48:40] takes place
[48:41] it see we see all this was a part of
[48:45] showing Jesus Christ amen all the things
[48:48] that he done for us that he he bridged
[48:51] that Gap
[48:52] it and that shoe bread being broken for
[48:55] us who we were and what we needed and he
[48:59] was that exact same
[49:02] thing you know when you talk about in
[49:06] the in the
[49:08] scripture and when you when you begin to
[49:11] look at some of these these things you
[49:13] know the the interesting thing about
[49:16] about this shoe bread the Sho bread was
[49:18] was hallowed it was it was it was
[49:21] Sanctified and it was placed before that
[49:23] and when it was taken away it was it was
[49:25] allowed for the priest to eat that bread
[49:27] that's
[49:29] right you know it was not given just for
[49:31] anybody to eat that right but you know
[49:35] in
[49:36] Matthew you read the scripture where
[49:39] Jesus and the disciples are go walking
[49:41] through the field on the Sabbath day
[49:43] they're walking through and the
[49:45] disciples begin to eat
[49:47] grain they begin to take the the the
[49:50] grain from the field and began to eat
[49:53] and you know they rebuked they rebuked
[49:54] Jesus and said your disciples are not
[49:56] not following the law they're breaking
[49:58] the law on the Sabbath yeah and what did
[50:01] Jesus tell them said did you ever read
[50:04] where David amen David when he was
[50:10] hungry and he went before a himc it's uh
[50:15] 1 Samuel chapter 21 if you want to read
[50:17] it but you know he goes before himc and
[50:19] he's on the run and he goes in there and
[50:22] he says he asks for bread that's right
[50:26] and he and he says I need do you have
[50:28] any bread and the high priest tells him
[50:30] said listen so we don't have any we
[50:31] don't have any common bread there's no
[50:33] he said all we have is the shoe bread
[50:37] that came from the
[50:40] Altar and so when you when you begin to
[50:42] read that scripture and then he asked
[50:44] him he says you know um what do you have
[50:48] and and he says you know well he said
[50:49] we've got this common bread but he says
[50:52] the
[50:53] um when when he ask him about it the
[50:55] first thing he says well you know
[50:58] um where have the WHERE have the young
[51:01] men been and um you know he says well
[51:04] the young men have he said long as they
[51:05] keep themselves from women because he
[51:07] said you know they they've not they've
[51:08] not been with any women and he says at
[51:10] least they they've hallowed themselves
[51:12] this much and he said he said they can
[51:14] give they can have this bread the priest
[51:17] because this is uh chapter 21:4 says and
[51:19] the priest answered David and said there
[51:21] is no common bread under my hand but
[51:23] there is hallowed bread if the young men
[51:25] have kept themselves at least from women
[51:26] women and David answered the priest and
[51:28] he said of a truth women women have been
[51:31] kept from us about these three days
[51:34] since I came out and the vessels of the
[51:36] young men are holy and the bread is in
[51:38] the manner common yay though it were
[51:41] Sanctified this day in the vessel so
[51:44] when he begins to speak about this
[51:46] because when that bread was brought out
[51:48] from the holy place and when it was
[51:50] brought out it was common really because
[51:53] but they could eat it but it was
[51:55] interesting that Jesus when he begins to
[51:57] speak of this he said that bread that
[51:59] hallowed bread was given to David and
[52:02] his men and they began to eat that and
[52:05] he says well how was it that Jesus you
[52:08] know G Jesus said well how is it that
[52:10] David was not breaking the law when he
[52:13] was eating the shoe bread that come from
[52:15] the altar from the table when he come
[52:18] out of the sanctuary and the high priest
[52:20] give it to them and they ate it and they
[52:22] weren't it wasn't counted against
[52:24] them and he said well how how was that
[52:27] that was and then he said you know they
[52:28] were eating the disciples were eating on
[52:30] the on the Sabbath why because they were
[52:33] hungry why because one of the things
[52:35] that the scripture tells us that when
[52:37] you see the in the scripture one of the
[52:39] things that's even in the Old Testament
[52:41] that he said you never forget the poor
[52:44] he said you never forget the hungry you
[52:45] never forget the stranger because you
[52:48] know he tells them he said you take care
[52:49] of the stranger when they're inside your
[52:51] land he said because you were strangers
[52:53] in Egypt one day he said you do not over
[52:56] overburden your strangers when they come
[52:58] into the land he said because you were
[53:00] burdened and overrun when you were in
[53:02] Egypt when you were a stranger in the
[53:04] land and when you come into the when
[53:05] they come into the land said you don't
[53:07] treat them that way you remember
[53:09] them and what did he tell them when you
[53:11] plant your Fields he said you don't
[53:13] harvest the corners he said you leave
[53:16] the he said what what was that for he
[53:18] said because it's for the poor and the
[53:20] hungry and the needy and the widows and
[53:22] whoever else because they need to have a
[53:25] portion why because you always remember
[53:27] them
[53:28] amen and so when it came to time when
[53:31] they ate the bread when when David was
[53:33] hungry and he came before the high
[53:35] priest and he needed something and the
[53:37] only thing was hallowed bread guess what
[53:39] he gave it to him why because he was
[53:41] hungry and when they were walking in
[53:43] when the disciples were walking in the
[53:44] field and they were hungry then there
[53:46] was something for them to eat why
[53:48] because that was the that was exactly
[53:50] what God has come for because is for
[53:53] those that are hungry he said because if
[53:56] you
[53:57] hungry he's but Jesus said he said I am
[53:59] the bread of life he said he that comes
[54:02] unto me he said they will never hunger
[54:04] again he said they will never thirst
[54:06] again why because he is the bread that
[54:08] you can
[54:12] receive see just like when people say
[54:15] talk about coming to the to the Lord's
[54:17] table well you know what we we're no
[54:19] nobody's ever going to be perfect enough
[54:22] not everybody's ever going to get to the
[54:23] place where they're going to be uh
[54:25] righteous enough to take the Lord's
[54:27] Supper but the thing is as God makes us
[54:30] worthy we don't make ourselves worthy if
[54:32] in our own eyes we will never take it
[54:34] but you know what you got to r on God
[54:37] God is the one that makes you that way
[54:39] and so if you are hungry then you know
[54:41] what all you got to do is come to God
[54:43] because God will F you because even just
[54:46] as David was hunger and then said
[54:48] because well you know it wasn't for him
[54:50] to eat but you know what the high priest
[54:52] was there and saw that there was a need
[54:55] and the need was bread and guess what it
[54:58] was given to them to eat why because God
[55:01] sees that you have a need then goess
[55:03] what God has the way Made For You amen
[55:07] amen all you got to do is come to God
[55:09] and he will feed you he will meet all
[55:11] your
[55:13] needs because Jesus when he began to
[55:16] talk to the the Pharisees there when
[55:18] they were standing there talking about
[55:20] the disciples eating in the field he
[55:22] said listen remember that the Sabbath
[55:24] was made for man not man made for the
[55:27] Sabbath because he was the lord of the
[55:29] Sabbath and so he makes this thing for
[55:32] us these things were made for
[55:39] us I don't know that does something for
[55:41] me I I brother Brown said you know he
[55:43] said he said I wish I was twice as much
[55:45] so he said I can make twice as much
[55:49] noise but you know God makes a way amen
[55:53] even even when we see these things it
[55:54] doesn't look like there's made a there's
[55:56] a
[55:57] way God makes a way amise the Lord even
[56:01] even when it looks like God even when it
[56:04] don't even look
[56:06] right amen but God makes a way God takes
[56:10] all things wrong and makes them right
[56:13] amen it's a it's a beautiful
[56:17] thing and I'm I'm gonna finish here in a
[56:20] minute but uh I just want to look here
[56:22] and uh the other the other portion of of
[56:25] the bread
[56:27] is the Mana and I just want to say a
[56:29] little bit about that but you know here
[56:31] is the Mana that
[56:33] fell as they were on that journey in the
[56:36] as the children of Israel was on their
[56:37] journey in the
[56:38] wilderness and here they are God fed
[56:41] them Mana
[56:42] amen fed Mana from heaven and took care
[56:46] of them all the way through on that
[56:47] Journey amen even when that even when
[56:50] they were unthankful that's right God
[56:53] took care of them and he fed them that
[56:55] Mana amen
[56:57] and here and the and the Mana they you
[57:00] know the the high priest that they
[57:01] filled up that rer and they put it in in
[57:04] the in the holy of holies where that
[57:07] testimony was there always that God fed
[57:10] them God always took care of them amen
[57:12] even when even when they were against
[57:14] God sure you know it's so a wonderful I
[57:17] always always talk tell when you when
[57:19] you talk about the Ark of the testimony
[57:22] you know you know when you look at that
[57:24] all those things that God done was a
[57:26] test testimony to to the children of
[57:28] Israel what God done
[57:30] amen he wrote the table of
[57:33] stone and the first tables got broke
[57:35] because Moses got upset with them
[57:37] because they had a golden calf and he
[57:39] said y'all shall have shall not have any
[57:41] other gods before me he broke those and
[57:43] God gave them those other tablets they
[57:46] were they were the rep they were the
[57:47] second second copy you know and it was
[57:50] the copy it was not the originals but
[57:52] you know those were in the in the holy
[57:54] of holies in that Arc of the testimony
[57:57] it was a testimony to them because you
[57:59] know what God kept his promises they
[58:01] didn't keep what God told them they were
[58:04] out there worshiping idols and and
[58:06] running away from God because well you
[58:08] know what Moses ain't here with us
[58:10] anymore and they go to Aaron and say
[58:12] make us
[58:15] Gods when they'd seen all the things
[58:17] that God done for them how God brought
[58:18] them all the way through and all the
[58:20] things had taken place here he was and
[58:22] they come into this place and he was
[58:23] like make us gods and they were out
[58:25] there run run around nude and acting all
[58:29] kinds of ways and they were out there
[58:30] and they said this is the god that
[58:32] delivered us from
[58:36] Egypt so here here is the ark and here
[58:39] is the the testimony the tables of stone
[58:42] with the Commandments on it because it
[58:44] showed that God kept his promise they
[58:47] didn't keep there that's right amen when
[58:50] they stood there and they told Moses
[58:53] well you know what you make too much you
[58:54] put too much on yourselves you you know
[58:57] we're we're we're holy people also you
[58:59] know God just don't speak to you God
[59:01] talks to more people than just you and
[59:03] you ain't got all the rules and the
[59:05] regulations and you know you ain't got
[59:07] everything you just don't know the mind
[59:08] of God on every
[59:10] situation and you know and it's like why
[59:12] is your brother the
[59:13] [Music]
[59:15] one it's always
[59:19] family well you know what you if you
[59:22] know if it wasn't Aaron you know if it
[59:24] wasn't moses' brother you know somebody
[59:26] else would get the chance but you know
[59:28] it's always
[59:30] family you know and then so you know
[59:33] it's like no that's who God called right
[59:36] amen but what did he say he told us
[59:40] okay we'll prove you everybody go get a
[59:43] rod 12 rods 12 tribes 12 men bring the
[59:46] rods we're going to put them in the Holy
[59:50] place we'll try it that's
[59:53] right we'll show you
[59:56] that God will do a miracle if it just if
[59:59] if the all 12 rods just say there
[1:00:01] nothing happens then guess what then you
[1:00:04] know you might have you might have a
[1:00:06] right to say the
[1:00:08] things but if God does a miracle if God
[1:00:11] does something Supernatural then he's
[1:00:12] going to show who he's called amen
[1:00:15] because Moses didn't call Aaron to the
[1:00:17] high
[1:00:18] priest he didn't call he didn't call the
[1:00:21] Levites God called them to the Levites
[1:00:24] to the to the priesthood amen
[1:00:26] he he he picked who he wanted and put
[1:00:29] who he wanted where he
[1:00:31] wanted and he put that Rod behind that
[1:00:34] beh in the in the presence in the
[1:00:36] holiest and so when that when they came
[1:00:40] back the next day God had done a work
[1:00:43] yeah right he chose one
[1:00:46] rod and it's like well it didn't but
[1:00:48] just become
[1:00:50] green no you know he didn't change
[1:00:53] colors or anything like
[1:00:55] that
[1:00:57] you know it wasn't it wasn't some kind
[1:00:58] of way that you could mistake what took
[1:01:01] place right here's a dead dried up Rod
[1:01:04] just like all 12 of them but all of a
[1:01:07] sudden one one thing took place in this
[1:01:09] dead Rod it budded and brought forth
[1:01:12] almonds why because it was an almond Rod
[1:01:15] to begin with and all of a sudden when
[1:01:17] the life hit it it became life and it
[1:01:19] brought it all the way through till it
[1:01:21] produce
[1:01:23] fruit why because it completed the whole
[1:01:25] process
[1:01:27] it just didn't turn grein and it just
[1:01:28] didn't flour it actually brought for the
[1:01:31] fruit it completed the whole
[1:01:35] process and that that Rod was placed in
[1:01:38] that testimony because it showed that
[1:01:40] God had done the work when they had
[1:01:43] stood against God he showed them that
[1:01:45] they that he was still in charge and he
[1:01:47] was still the one that was leading them
[1:01:49] when they were against what he believe
[1:01:51] you know what he said they didn't
[1:01:53] believe what he
[1:01:55] said and here they are and you know we
[1:01:58] you know we're going to die out here in
[1:01:59] the wilderness and we just can't we just
[1:02:01] can't overcome and look you just brought
[1:02:03] us out here to die we're never going to
[1:02:05] make it and you know and God fed them
[1:02:08] Supernatural
[1:02:10] Mana amen Mana from Heaven y a
[1:02:15] supernatural feeding
[1:02:18] yeah and so here they are they had this
[1:02:22] full in the holy of
[1:02:24] holies three times they stood against
[1:02:28] God denied the word was against what God
[1:02:31] had said and all three times God was
[1:02:33] standing there in his testimony in the
[1:02:36] and the holy of place the holy of holies
[1:02:39] there was those three times that God
[1:02:41] showed them that he was in charge he had
[1:02:44] been exactly what he said he was going
[1:02:46] to be to them he was the one that he was
[1:02:47] their provider their protector
[1:02:49] everything that they had need of he
[1:02:51] supplied
[1:02:52] it and here and here the the high priest
[1:02:55] was when he comes into that holy of
[1:02:57] holies he's bringing that blood in there
[1:03:00] and he's standing in the holy of holies
[1:03:02] in the shika glory and he's standing
[1:03:05] there and when he's standing there with
[1:03:07] the blood and he's standing there
[1:03:10] looking at those things and here he is
[1:03:11] looking at a rod that budded and he's
[1:03:14] looking at those tables of stone and
[1:03:17] he's looking at that R of of
[1:03:21] Mana when he's standing in that in that
[1:03:23] Holy place and he's standing there with
[1:03:25] the blood blood and he sees what God has
[1:03:27] done and there is there's the
[1:03:30] Fulfillment of what God had promised
[1:03:32] them and they're standing in the full in
[1:03:34] the in the Holy place standing there
[1:03:36] looking at those things and he begins to
[1:03:37] bring the
[1:03:40] blood well what what brother R said
[1:03:42] every believer has the opportunity to
[1:03:45] come into the holy of holies that's
[1:03:47] exactly why because when when when Jesus
[1:03:50] died he said the the temple the veil
[1:03:52] rent he said what have made access for
[1:03:54] all of us to step in to the holy of
[1:03:56] holies and when what was it because it
[1:03:58] was his blood that was shed that we have
[1:04:01] access into the holy of holies and the
[1:04:04] way has been made because it has been
[1:04:06] opened up and let me tell you when you
[1:04:07] step in there all of a sudden and God
[1:04:09] wants to show you all the things that
[1:04:11] you've been through in your life God has
[1:04:13] already made a way and if you just stand
[1:04:15] here tonight how many can stay here
[1:04:16] tonight and raise your hands and talk
[1:04:18] about the things that God has fulfilled
[1:04:20] in your
[1:04:21] life you can see those things just like
[1:04:24] when he stood there when there were
[1:04:26] everything was dead and dried up and
[1:04:27] there was no way God Made A Way amen
[1:04:31] when you were lost in sin and you had no
[1:04:33] hope and there was no way there was a
[1:04:35] way made and God come to you in your
[1:04:37] worst position The Lost and the Darkness
[1:04:40] of all things and you you know how God
[1:04:43] he just lets everything just get to the
[1:04:45] worst place that you
[1:04:47] get way down in the gut or somewhere
[1:04:50] where you got to look up to see the
[1:04:51] bottom right and all of a sudden God
[1:04:54] comes along and begins to deal with you
[1:04:57] and he begins to speak to you and bring
[1:04:59] you his brother Ernie villain said from
[1:05:01] the gutter most to the uttermost that's
[1:05:04] right why because when God brings you to
[1:05:06] those places and shows you what God has
[1:05:08] done for you amen when you step into how
[1:05:11] many because then when you can
[1:05:13] understand what he says when you have
[1:05:15] access he said come boldly before the
[1:05:17] throne of grace why you don't have to
[1:05:19] worry about it because so many times
[1:05:21] well I I don't know what God will do and
[1:05:23] you get so wored if you only begin to
[1:05:25] see when you have access into that what
[1:05:28] God has done for you and you see all the
[1:05:29] times that God has brought you through
[1:05:31] he's delivered you he's healed
[1:05:34] you well if God's done that before then
[1:05:37] what
[1:05:38] changes
[1:05:40] on what because if you've had faith that
[1:05:43] God has brought you to a place of
[1:05:44] justification then guess what when you
[1:05:46] step before the Lord then realize God's
[1:05:48] Justified you then all if you can
[1:05:50] realize you've got that Revelation that
[1:05:52] God has showed you that your past sins
[1:05:54] have have been cut off guess what you
[1:05:56] continue to walk because God will bring
[1:05:58] you to a place of
[1:05:59] sanctification thank you Lord because if
[1:06:02] you've seen God do anything if God's
[1:06:04] healed you if God's delivered you he's
[1:06:05] paid your
[1:06:06] bills whatever has G if you've seen your
[1:06:09] children saved if you've seen anything
[1:06:11] that God has done then guess what if
[1:06:12] he's done it one time he's the same
[1:06:14] yesterday today and forever if he's done
[1:06:16] it for one person he'll do it
[1:06:18] again but he wants you to step into the
[1:06:21] access that he's made for you into the
[1:06:23] holy of
[1:06:24] holies right and you'll see what God has
[1:06:27] done yeah amen

[1:06:40] body I can't remember the rest of it I
[1:06:43] can think of it Look What the Lord Has
[1:06:45] Done see what when you step in those
[1:06:48] things you see what God has done amen

[1:06:53] for you amen where did God bring you
[1:07:01] from when when you begin to look at all
[1:07:03] the things that you've been through when
