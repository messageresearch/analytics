in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name proverbs 18:10 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it in our sight what about a haven a place and all that Satan can get to right you can't do nothing about it okay let's go to Exodus 3 you immediately know that this is Moses at the burning bush but I want to try back with out a little bit and try to move on with titles to his name and and speak a little bit about it sure it says annan Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your father's has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you and God said moreover to Moses I shot this shalt thou say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your father's the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we tried Sunday bringing out and speaking and we've been talking about the name of God the season we were well familiar so we don't have to spend all of the time explaining well God's not a you know and it's an object of worship but we do that just for others to try to help but I want to try if we can to not to bring this thought and idea and bring it up to Christ and his birth and then maybe we will continue a little more on that Sunday but now remember what we went through they asked brother Branham in questions and answers it has the name of God changed in the different dispensation and he says yes that it has changed he said because now let's just read that mikoshi you know to make sure we follow it they can go ahead and put it up on the screen says has the name of the Lord changed in the different dispensation yes yes it was once called he was called the I am no us he didn't say name is that he was called the I am he's called Jehovah he's changed many times the last time it was changed was when he when God became flesh and took a human name see Jehovah I am all of those are titles to a name alright he says his human name is the Lord Jesus Christ right now trying to make the point to back up just a little bit to where we can follow the thought that trying to find a name of God then we say well that's Jesus alright we know that but is that by revelation or is it just a name or a thought you know well we know it's not well then the Bible says ask anything in my name it will be given unto you why is it that sometimes you ask and get and sometimes you asking don't get is that right why don't you say well the Lord is just trying to introduce that you can pop up you know prop up any point but I don't think that's the thing that we need to be concerned with trying to prop up something we need to be serious minded and think about things all right and see then I'll get to it more Sunday but see we talked about that the name of Jesus was lost in the ages well what did they call him did they call him Joe Jim Charlie what did they call him he said when that's done brother Dale they called him Jesus well how could the name be lost and the Prophet said the name was lost in the ages right so then what was he called what does it mean to lose a name to our human thinking it means that they couldn't pronounce you know just stating that for a fact it would mean they couldn't pronounce his name down through that but that's not what it is cuz they called him Jesus it doesn't matter today all the way around the world they're calling him Jesus right see then what is it or why is it so hard for us to think about the name of God and what it is well see then we thought well what do you mean you know cuz that's when people say it all right now I'm giving this as an illustration see people will say what do you mean his name is God you know that's his name well that's not his name God means object of worship that's a title to a night all right we see we come over on the other side of it now and we say but but we know now what his name is what do you mean you know now what his name is I called him Jesus in the Baptist Church what you call him or you come from are you listening but you say well what do you mean his name is Jesus brother Dale we know that's true but we know the whole world causing Jesus is there a different way that we pronounce the word Jesus than others pronouncing it you know it's a different way of us spelling it maybe or a thought you know what is it that was what I was trying to get at Sunday though to where we could pick up something and think about it that word God in Genesis 1 32 33 times I it uses the word God and that is translated from the word Elohim because that was the best I could do with it okay now may I ask you to think a little bit if they could derive in Genesis to call him Elohim what was the problem over at the burning bush that they could not pronounce his name I mean if that could derive you understand that could derive and come up without him and say that Elohim means and I gave them to you if you want them it right here in front of me where he's a self existing one the mighty God unveil all right it means self existing yeah now they could bring that up and they could maybe in some other words use it and bring it up but why was it that when it comes to the name of God in other references that they couldn't pronounce it sure okay we understand there was a different way of spelling so when the scholars begin to write from Genesis one they could conclude all of them to doing and dealing with Elohim the self existing one because that would be the first title that you could conceive of Almighty God one who exists alone right but how come they couldn't do it when it comes to jvh you ciello him meaning the self-existing one the one who exists alone then when he comes up to Genesis 2 we see that it says God in Genesis then they'll come out in Genesis 2 and it'll say Lord God missing your Bible and they derived out of that the best understanding they can do as to say that it's Jehovah Elohim Elohim being self-existing Jehovah deriving from the words or thoughts that it would come up that he was like a father with his family so then we see that putting the two together he's the self existing God that now exists with his family because just drive to Java he's in throughout the Old Testament they use the form of Jehovah remember I gave them to you Sunday is it means what see when he came down to make an amateur God out of mankind and come to dwell with God in Genesis 2 I'm looking at the message called adoption so he isn't self existing anymore he exists with his family he's not self existing anymore see he'll never go back to being the self existing one but the self existing one will always be here because I can listen to your message like I said Brett erratum sitting and learning in John 1:1 where it says in the beginning was the word word with God he said we can say that in the beginning with Elohim Elohim was without him and elle' him without him and Elohim wouldn't make flesh and dwelt among us the self existing God could come down to dwell with mankind he doesn't use the title self existing anymore because he's not self existing he's existing with his creation and remember Sunday I brought out the animals and all like that that's not a part of it but when he created man he was no longer self existing he was Jehovah then from what they brought out he was Jehovah throughout the Old Testament we used Psalms 83 and 18 a little bit weird so much you're hopefully himself talking about but then we used Exodus 6 and 3 but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them if that's what they call me why would he say that they call me Jehovah I said I'm not known unto them its Jehovah but they derived a part of Jehovah to where it would come out to be like a father with his family are you listening he said what are you trying to get to I'm trying to get to one thing they called him Jehovah and that was the best I could do he honored those children of Israel and was their God but he said by my name Jehovah I was never known to know is that Bible well I mean if it's Bible saying that one scriptures say they called me is your whole world I'm Jehovah to them and then he turned around and says but I was never known well he must have been something about the name Jehovah that they couldn't figure out so you know what that is it was Jay vhu and there was no way to pronounce it there was no way to be able to interpret what was being said you remember we gave them from the Prophet last week did we call it Jehovah but it isn't no one can interpret it why it's the eternal one it's the eternal one even the Hebrew scholars could never pronounce it that burning bush listen is Jehovah many points throughout the scripture then he's relating it to the burning bush and even the Hebrew scholars could never pronounce it that burning bush there that day when he met Moses and he said to Moses he said by what name you read up and down in your there were Moses and no he told him he was Almighty God and you'll find him saying I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said but I'm not going until you tell me your name when he didn't say okay my name is I am that I am nobody say he said something the day interpreted down to mankind in the language what that was are you following me to remember one thing gonna be real slow I want you to think remember one thing that you can still today call him Jehovah but write them dear you can call him el ahem but random did you can call him I am right about him did but what's his name why was it they could never pronounce that name and to show you it's the same person he spoke to Moses is that I am that I am and when Jesus come forth later on in John he said before Abraham was I am the Prophet said it's the same God the Bible says in Acts I got it over here in a little bit talking about Jesus Christ the Angel of the covenant that he was the one that spoke to Moses from the burning bush or in other words in the wilderness at Mount Sania but you see we say we know what the name is but why what was our problem now I want you to think seriously we talk about attributes of God right we talked about in the beginning the God dwelt alone the self existing one etc the Prophet explaining it right he said he had attributes in him we know that he didn't gain no attributes as he came down he had all the attributes in him before the world ever begun he just displayed his attributes right but now here's a thought I want you to write down and take home with you no one coddle you know what I mean title I'm talking about Elohim Jehovah I am father son Holy Ghost Lily LaValley right Morningstar alpha the bigger you understand me no one title can contain the attributes of God or Michael manifest remember let's put it that way no one title can't do it it takes all of the titles coming together that's what I was trying to illustrate Sunday it took four thousand years all the profits all the preaching and all of the things before the name Jesus would come forward now hope you was listening remember brother Alan said they was plenty of Jesus's in the name of Jesus see we think that that was the only time that's how carnal our thoughts are that the name j esus was never said until it was said over here in John or Matthew or whatever what about today a lot of people are called Jesus right what does that make them Jesus that's their knife but now think on this dog what I was aiming to Sunday is too far into it not to back up the title of Elohim is self-existing right that doesn't contain all the attributes of God or maybe display em or whatever you want to go into it you know of saying it maybe my language or English the sense is not too good and I agree zart but just get the point jehovah that would mean like a father with his family all the attributes of God is not contained in Java or made manifest in Java and C they used Yehovah but then when it comes to the burning bush is really the account that you label it to work then Moses wanted to know his name now if they'd have been calling him Jehovah before then what was the matter with Moses why didn't he say Jehovah because he knew there was something else different run around and said it I didn't I quoted it to you a minute ago he said Moses couldn't even interpret it Moses couldn't tell you what that name was it's what he said about what name I know it I require for you to think and I wished it to heaven we could do that you understand what I'm getting at there was some word written some something written out that the scholars developed the point of Elohim and called himself existing that's a good thought but it's good place to start right then they called him Lord God Jehovah in Genesis because when he created man he was Java like a father with his family we come to Moses in Exodus and he says what's your name why didn't mother say a burning bush great experience something supernatural it's got to be we know it's something of God what didn't he say now Jehovah love him I want to talk to you he could have said that because that's who was talking to him right that was your hotel ahem because remember table one God but I got a scripture get down the life if I make it don't rain out Sunday you remember the scripture said even now but one night what are you following my salt now no one coddle so I am that I am is the closest to it because Elohim would be the self existing the self existing would create and he would display his attributes of create or he would be called and I returned in God you know angels retired they could worship Him what that with what he wanted but see you got to combine Jehovah and they love him to come out to the hav aah I think you'd wish for that but he simply means a father with his family so that's what your whole was developed put your over and I love him together and read your Bible that's all I've asked you you don't have to know all about all this stuff and I've had people tell me to brother Dale my Bible don't italicize them letters like yours what are you reading well if it don't italicize it was it safe in my Bible in Genesis 2 it says capital L o our D God what is your site no matter where it's capital or not are you with me it'll make no difference where it's capital or not that's just a point I try to illustrate it still said in Genesis 2 Lord God going through your Bible and read it and watch that follow that pattern all the way to Moses but it don't stop with Moses he keeps on passing 9 only use the italicize are at what you call it on the letter to emphasize because if you read it and think the Bible said the Lord said unto my lord check that one of them's a capital L and the other one's a lowercase they knew it meant something but if it don't capitalize it come on kids read it it still says Lord God Jehovah ever him the self-existing one has now created something to exist with him like him which was man then when he comes to Moses at the burning bush what did Moses call him Lord God you'd already told him I am to Almighty God he said I am that I am so there's no way then that could be pronounced or understood because that would were you would derive it back to the jv8 you let a random user j v HP one time and said sorry in other words he involved is j vh you now listen think on this a minute you follow my point for using elohim you cannot cover all the attributes thereby with meal now you know you understand what i'm saying you can't cover all the attributes put it up to jehovah you can't cover all the attributes because it's not a name it's a title to a name are you willing but then you see why when we ended up sunday we ended up sunday making a statement by putting all the attributes together all the titles together you come up with a name Jesus Jesus can display all the attributes oh you didn't know what's going on away dizzy Jesus can display all the attributes the name Jesus has within itself all of those attributes he's your whole genre Jehovah ref eyes you over kissing you he's the morning star to rotten he's they all and all he's the Alpha and Omega he's everything in that one night because Jesus is not a title and like I've always said to you when it says over an Isaiah that you'll have a son as you call his name Emmanuel what didn't they call him Emmanuel when he came let me say what your prophet said they called him Emmanuel you'll read out that's what Jesus name is Emmanuel they called him God are you with one name can contain ever attribute but one attribute cannot contain ever attribute so you had to keep coming down Elohim self existed Jehovah father with his family I am that I am which means ever-present for eternity and Jesus saying let me restate that Scripture and I hope you don't call me a scripture changer but when I say before Moses was I am couldn't he say the same time couldn't he say before Abraham was I am couldn't he say before Moses was I am couldn't he say before Joseph was I am couldn't he say before Elohim what I am because the I am brings it to present tense yeah so we ended it up by saying jvh you could never be pronounced because it had no vowels or what it is in the English part to be able to pronounce it so they added things to it and they come up with you over the best they could do because you hold them in exactly what he had done the self-existing one that they derived Ella him from as meaning self-existing that's what the name means self-existing and they took that and then when they said okay he ignorant he does not now exist anymore alone he's got his family he's created man he's no longer self existing and never will he ever be except existing again but now he's like a manor or a man with his family this is well that's the best closest we can get to it so we'll call him Jehovah but what about it why didn't they call him Jehovah why did the angel of the Lord not say to Mary Matthew 1:21 I guess it it she shall call this she shall bring forth the sons I shall call his name Jesus I didn't just stop there are you winning pull that one up brothers were three thirteen hey I guess it is or thirteen it didn't stop calling him Jesus look what it says she shall bring forth a son now you know what it is Isaiah said you'll call his name Emmanuel but when Gabriel spoke to Mary he didn't call it Emmanuel he called him Jesus why why didn't he say manua Emmanuel means God with us which that's the point it means God with us come on are you listening it means God with us that's exactly what it means that's what it is is God with us throughout Jesus God with us but what's his name Oh his name's Jesus okay look I shall call his name Jesus and what you ever title fall with that name come on laid it down to now ever title falls to the name of Jesus Jesus can fulfill ever title the title came fulfill the name God His only depart for the time he was ever him for that time he was your home for that time he was I have for that time little I shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now he's the savior and this was done and once not to just name in Jesus come on art read your Bible sometime and look at the words you know they don't change because I read them you know what I mean you're supposed to read like me I mean we were taught in school 1 1 2 2 we've taught we spoke to know all about them things a is a and B is being and I went to banks County so I guess it kicks off a lot of it I made it two weeks in high school Kassie I quit that worked for a few years done away with all the recesses and went and finished my high school education in two days you see kids you got all them recesses where the problems that okay take that where you'll forget it now are you back with me come on now she's he'll bring forth the Sun that's how called his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins machi now this was done to call him Jesus was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet said behold a virgin shall be with child and she'll bring forth a son as I shall call his name Emmanuel which is being interpreted on it God with us but a random I got it in here if you want said when they called him Emmanuel I called him Jesus Jesus was before the flesh come into being as a baby are you following me Jesus was what Gabriel said to Mary but that's what he said to fulfil the scriptures that said call him Emmanuel but that only means God with us that ain't all is it because his name Emmanuel would be no more than Elohim or self-existing he said but his name is Jesus you know what the Prophet is said about it so you read it you don't read it then heaven help you you know what he said the first time the name Jesus was ever spoke with by an angel now are you with me or what I said while ago come on you at least didn't get up run out when I said that the name of Jesus was used prophet said there was many Jesuses in the days of Jesus without the first time the 9 j esus was said when the Gabriel said it Oh but is the only one that could save us from our sins there was nobody else there salvation and none of the name in the name of Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh and you know they the carpenter the Jesus the bricklayer and Jesus - whatever Jesus the Christ the first time the name Jesus then will say we spoke was by an angel told Mary you know the story right Mary leaves called her cousin Elizabeth had conceived about six months before then and I'm quoting off of brother Branham if it runs three or four you do what you want to I just read what he said okay it's in about six months you know what happened John's daddy wouldn't call his name couldn't get it straight he called him John he said okay if you can't believe this and you can't get it straight of what I'm telling you he said you're just gonna be dumb until he comes why did you do that with him because he wouldn't get him the truth he wouldn't believe in it the way it's supposed to be believed so he said you listened to show you you're going to be dumb you know you can't speak until the baby is born when the baby was born they brought her trying to bring writing what he did currents all over his name's John took a supernatural thing to release a man's lives where he could call him John how much more supernatural to call Jesus Jesus may I quote brother Branham now quote the Bible when Mary goes to Elizabeth and it says she makes her salutation you know what it's saying now come on turn in your Bible right there if you want to - and I'll show you what I'm talking about it doesn't use the name Jesus somebody gets your scripture ready there's no record written down that Mary went and come in and said his name is Jesus no she made a salutation my point is we safe it ain't in the letter I don't believe it it ain't in the letters are of it the name Jesus was Pope but we know it was because we not a prophet that said it was so the Prophet said her salutation in other words Mary's announcement was Elizabeth I'm pregnant oh you oh you and Joseph no not Joseph what do you mean Mary who's the daddy her salutation says the Holy Spirit overshadowed me and Gabriel told me to call him Jesus right it's just not written out there in plain language all right it's as quick as that name Jesus was pronounced a baby that had moved come to life run I don't try to be mean and arrogant I just try to bring things out as her truth and let you look at it we talked about John receiving the Holy Ghost before he left his mother's womb why don't you read that scripture right there somebody read it and you'll see that when Elizabeth heard that she was filled with a holy God we don't talk about her Luke 141 she was filled with the Holy Ghost what are you doing brother branham you're emphasizing this man got it different from Mary Mary I mean Elizabeth Elizabeth got an anointing to come over her this man got life in the womb come on study the message it's a beautiful wonderful picture but it has a lot of loopholes in it if you don't how the holy ghost to fill it up with sorry for using that kind of language but it's all I got got what you see the next time his name is mentioned as being said was over with I believe with Simeon and coming forward and when it comes forward and he tells what he does and you know what they don't in those Bible times they didn't name the baby until his eighth day go am i right they circumcised on the eighth day gave it a night so they gave it to named Jesus on the eighth day for human records with mankind I'll quote these we'll get back to him later your prophet said look at our he said little Jehovah well he didn't say now little Jesus laying in the cradle what did he say come on Radim acid listen to the message he said Lord y'all were crying in a cradle he said little Jehovah playing as a boy he said Little Joe home and you got to put two together to get this but he said little little Jehovah with no teeth they don't run the computer try to find no teeth in Jesus you've got to get two or three times together I got it you are short three he said with a little Jehovah or no key then why did he say little Jesus with no teeth okay well Jehovah I got another message by - down the road come on whatever others say I hate to say this at the time cuz it opened up a lot what this ain't you hold the old Jesus within you or else we don't know how the Godhead correct so you better understand the name of Jesus they named him Jesus because it meant ever title that could ever be broke throughout the whole Old Testament so with John Reggio at this canoed all of those Lily the valley the Rose of Sharon rotten Morningstar the Alpha to me all the titles coming in to Father Son and Holy Ghost coming into all names his name is Jesus name is Jesus they didn't get this one so I'll go ahead and read it you don't have to hunt for it Dolf of a message called God's chosen place of worship I kept throwing this one back throwing this and back and kept falling up throwing it back okay I'll read it I done read it but I meant to you listen what he said on God's children place of worship 1965 and then we find that Jesus said also I came in my father's name and you received me not then the name of the father must be Jesus that's right the name of the Father is Jesus because Jesus said so I'm reading over here be glad to get this for you if you want it I carry my father's 19 I come in my father's name and you receive me not then his name was Jesus and Gabriel called him Jesus when they got the AirCam they beat me to it and Gabriel called him Jesus look the prophets called him Jesus come on where the prophets ever say Jesus come on Ritchie prophets message by revelation sometimes every time one of them prophet said Jehovah they was calling Jesus every time they called him any name you want to put dar Jehovah Jireh Arella him or whatever all them prophets was calling him Jesus and when they called him Emmanuel Isaiah it was calling in Jesus read it and Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets called him Jesus it was absolutely Jesus before his birth even the holy prophet called his name Emmanuel which is God with us then God was manifested in the flesh in order to take away the sin of the world and doing so he was given the name of Jesus so Jesus is the knight and the name was placed in a man not a church not a denomination I decreed but a man he chose to place his name in Jesus Christ and we find out dire then that then he becomes excuted to place it he becomes to the place of God's worship where you can worship Him even before he was ever born his name was called Jesus do you see that I mean does everybody understand that statement he's making that when they called him Joe whole way they would call him Jesus because that was his name Joe was not a knight when they call him Jehovah Jireh Jehovah this kid there's Rose of Sharon Lily invited any titles anything in the Old Testament when those prophets called his name that's called him Jesus we wrote down their usual carnal code it doesn't say let's not I said Sunday I said that's where God hides it and simplicity what offender said what have you picked up your Bible what if you didn't know anything and you went you picked up a Bible but yet you'd heard stories about Jesus and you read in Genesis 1 and it said in the beginning Jesus created heaven in there Genesis 2 Jesus created these three adidas create they've been a mystery there'd be no mystery if I was in profits back there every time they started to say his name and they said Jesus it'd be no mystery the name was so honored and revered they say the story was that Lazarus was ascribed writing that and every time they would come to that name of God they would stop and lay their pin down and go take a full bath and come back they so reverence that night they said the reason that he died he died probably a pneumonia can take it too many bites right in the scroll it's not a plaything to them were you following me his name was called Jesus it was so important it was give to the mother by the angel Gabriel that his name would be called Jesus son of God but he was but when they called him Emmanuel they called him Jesus it just couldn't be pronounced why because it would been j vh v bi j vh you speak and they couldn't pronounce it the angel gabriel you think he goofed up you mean he brought god's name from glory right was he to deliver the message am i right was Gabriel to deliver the message from glory he brought the name of who he brought the name of the Father that's why Jesus said I come in my father's nothing he brought to the name of the Father he brought the name of Almighty God he brought the name of Jehovah he brought all of those titles and forms and he brought it down to a name Jesus David aren't you afraid you'll go into a oneness with it not afraid because it I just covered stuff that the one this won't cover when this won't cover that he had many many attributes that he had many manifestations they say the night that Jesus is the only form of God and I differ with them 100% cause the bride of Jesus Christ is the life form of God to the Gentile dispensation then he goes to Israel and in a more fee then they become what he's brought that ain't one this I wish you would sitting here today running it and looking I wish you would go back and read the church age book and to read each age and the message to each age now sign your topic go reading sure change and see how it'll come up and it'll say they lost this day the next church age his name comes back brother Branham said it's between the 6th and 7th church age and I'm gonna say it this way so yeah I'm not going to get through this I don't know how far I'm going but I'm going to stay with what I can you're talking about a new name of Jesus you better go find out the first time I spoke up is in the 68 and but around and says that is the message to that age there is no new name of Jesus spoken of in the seventh church age you don't believe in a new name of Jesus I might believe it a whole lot more than you think cuz remember that name in Chuck in Rev let the six Church age he's also related to your night and run around city we made known when we get you now you just done away with my thoughts of the new name brother do you know I have it let me change the time I just like to read both sides of the story where you can decide yourself this ain't new in 40 some years I've been teasing is this way so it's not a new thing to come up with some kind of show and you surely know for certain I ain't never come out here and start to try to tell you somebody something about a new night because according to my Bible if you get a you name the Bible says you can't even tell anybody you can't tell nobody you said yeah but you're not well I like to run both sides of the story what are you what about this name what about it let's going over hurry up all right get over to 15 just start reading some off the message adoption priest in 1960 look what brother Branham says and Father Son the Holy Ghost is not no name of God God has one name and his name is Jesus the Bible says the family in heaven his name Jesus so he came from a birth the family and earth is named Jesus it was brought down here though God had one name human night and he was had a name called Jehovah Jireh chauvelin that was a title to his deity but he had one name Jesus one night this is all I've ever said about the new name of Jesus the new name you're looking for until we exalt I'm in exhaust the name of Jesus don't worry about a new night until we're finished with what is here don't worry about a new night and my Bible says that Jesus will be called by the Jews after we get out of here Jesus but this don't think you could get it all figured out because you're thinking I'm just trying to make something I'm trying to state what a prophet had to say until the name of Jesus is fully understood I'll make it this way until you can understand that all the attributes of Jehovah God are in Jesus Christ then you can start talking about a new night I know what he said is he'll go first field talking about his night cut is one of them instead to be made known in the thunders know that I can quote you all the things about it I've had them written down for 40 years but I've never come up with something trying to tell you some kind of a new night because see Jesus has not done away with commit yet until we come to the places you can leave what you want to until we come to the basis that we can ask in Jesus name and see it done don't worry about a new night that's not a lot of ever talk look what he says go ahead the Philadelphian Church age number 16 what's the name of God Jesus they are in a pillar in the devil my god and I'll write upon him the name of my god you know the name of the city of my god and I and then that finishes up by saying than not my new name and what is he turning to say and what's the name with God Jesus you want to jot it down we've got a little late here Jesus viens said in heaven and earth all his name Jesus now anybody I already don't have a Bible don't want to look at it the whole hell it doesn't say in the name of Jesus and Ephesians it just tells you to all in heaven and earth is named that night I try to cut off the smart alecks before they get too smart okay because it says actually what it's there for it's called by my knee under the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named from the Lord Jesus Christ going to the next one Philadelphia Church age 3:17 and I write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god and what is the name of God well he was God with us Emmanuel but that was not his given 9dr call his name jesus jesus said I came to my father's name and you received me not therefore the name of God is Jesus for that is the name he came in he is Lord Jesus Christ that's the name he came in okay keep going with 18 I just provided place of worship 65 his name was God and God has many titles God is a toggle itself we call Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Jehovah Kanishka new man instance and he was called the Rose of Sharon lily of the valley bright morning star Alpha Omega beginning in and Father Son and Holy Ghost and all these but his name God's name is Jesus Christ The Anointed One Jesus The Anointed One that is his name he had many titles for one name the only not another name under heaven given whereby among men whereby you must be saved so if God's name is not Jesus where's your salvation go into the next what's this one taken from the adoption in 1960 the whole family is named Jesus the whole church is named to you everything is named Jesus for it's the only name that God ever had that's plain enough he's called you hold a job I do it Lord provided he's called many a thing but he had one name go ahead to the next one God you're only provided place of worship 1965 the place where I chose to choose to put my name now there's not another place in the Bible given where that God ever put his name only in Jesus Christ for he is the son of God taking the name of God and God's human name there's not another name given under heaven whereby me must be safe it was a next one well excuse me 24:21 okay yeah okay God told Moses he said now I'm going to send my angel before you to keep you into play anyone knows that the angel was Jesus Christ but around says and watching if you can't see Christ in ever verse or the Bible go back and read it again now he never said if you can't see Jesus go see that brings it over to a fleshly pond but he said if you can't see cry who was the one that told Moses a better way of doing that but around said I was confused on that until he showed me it was Christ the very angel of the Covenant that was in the burning bush Christ that led the children of Israel the same Java Christ which was the pillar of fire it was Christ his name wasn't Jesus yet on him until he was manifested in flesh but the whole thing I want to now stop the reason they didn't say in the beginning Jesus created the world in the beginning was the incident beginning with that you remember it would give away the secret and remember watch him anyone knows that the angel was Jesus Christ which was the pillar of fire pillar of fire and watch him it wasn't Christ his name wasn't Jesus yet why because all the attributes had not been fulfilled he could be a lot of things but he was never a savior back her he could be the angel that led the children it was really good ball rolling son but he wouldn't a savior but God come on now there was salvation back tyre don't misunderstand he wouldn't die as a savior and if he wouldn't there as a savior and we just read closer you'll save his people from their sins his name Jesus his name wasn't Jesus that time why he was the one that was in the wilderness let me give you this last one Zachariah 14 and 9 and the Lord shall be a king over all there in that day shall there be one Lord and his name one what about it what do you think about the name of God was a brother I just don't understand because the name of God is God what is all the things about it is God that's what it is well maybe that's the reason we don't get what we're asking for because maybe we're still trying to approach him as God instead of approaching him from his name because remember he kept telling us to ask anything white and he said ask the father anything and why Jesus emphasized a lot in the Matthew Mark Luke and John I come in my father's name the only name that God ever had is Jesus but it took four thousand years to get a revelation to people nothing they could understand you right it could be called Jesus if you could pronounce his name and remember it what no scholar that pronounce his name it was the angel of the Lord you remember Gabriel you remember the seller that brought the first coming in that way and you know that Gabriel is to announce the second coming okay I go way back a couple of messages but it's alright and go back to Zerubbabel and find out who he was and we might find out what happened in this day as you see we didn't know that name brother Branham said the name of Jesus was lost in the ages as I said well ago what did he call him what was lost of him I got it Sunday to come through the revelation of who he is not was our will be with who he is and it says in the field church age it you got a name that you're living with you're dead but around said day lost his name six church age and comes back and talk to about his name the Prophet said between the 6th and 7th church age the name of Jesus began to be restored that's where you wound up with your oneness people and Jesus only people because life was coming forth here come the Prophet he said now Jesus he said there's many Jesuses but once he but he said there's only one Lord Jesus Christ there's only one man in the world that was named Jesus that's crazy cause you just got to explain it if they would lot of people like our College Jesus that's what I'm just saying but it don't refer to none of them maths at this way but a run said your name may work out to be 666 remember that one when he said you're not setting on seven hills so don't worry about right you can call him Jesus Jesus and be worshipping the devil yeah but God knows who I'm talking about that's what you you just you tear me up cuz you just make it so hard to lock in something guts no it's got to be revealed come on another scripture how would this man healed of this important disease we don't know a few weeks ago said it was the name now that in all the scripture what to say that it was in the name and faith in the name is what makes this man stand before you hold this day revelation of the name we lost the revelation of the name in the Dark Ages and come out calling him the second person of the Trinity in that name is 9 to get it is nothing is Jesus that's too simple and you just moved us up from calling in God so for now we'll call him Jesus the Bible don't have no trouble calling God the Bible don't have any trouble calling you Jehovah the Bible don't have any trouble calling me mellow humor you know over the nine photographer instead of him but rattled it out on no problem of calling him Jehovah little Jehovah crying in the cradle Little Joe hopeless working in the carpenter shop there's your hovel laying in the manger he had no trouble to them see or not it don't in it don't influence me for you to use words that you think are so smart in other words you say well now we know instead of we're calling him God we'll call him Jesus he is my god he is my father he is my Savior he is my all and all in Jesus is his name but has it clip I mean by revelation that Jesus is the only name of God I'm just Adonis's anxiety if that was made known right here tonight you couldn't hold this building together with people hollering and screaming I'm talking about myself what do you mean we know I came in Jesus but do we know that is my father that is my Savior that is my all and all that is everything and his name is Jesus you want to write him a letter don't ride it Father Son and Holy Ghost and sign it right you don't want to check written out that way do you he's doing this Jesus you know what I like about him Gordon the Chrysler mister God revealed the bride is part of the mystery must be revealed Oh God was reporting Christ cited right in here but not that quote but another all the God was reporting Christ all Christ a church he's part of the mystery but who wants to know anything about the bride the end Ruthie he's part of the mystery and got to be revealed you can't be revealed as a second person you can't be revealed as some of the thoughts or ideas the Bride of Christ is not another person it is God made manifest in another form called a bride sons and daughters of God have the name of God what is your name miss Jesus mm oh God is a strong tower the righteous run intuitive they're safe one more time to say it no one title attribute thought can display all of God but the name of Jesus has within it everything that God would ever be and will ever be and he's ever-present for eternity his name is Jesus the bride part of the mystery I wouldn't when it said it Reverend said the bride would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily I talked that 1959 so you can argue oh you won't do that you see how long I've been talking about when I said the bride would be the son of man the Word made flesh again alert before che change comes that was 1969 what do you think I'm thinking now I'm just trying to get somebody to believe it you remember what I ended up saying I made a report this is my report I made the statement the way I'm in it I said these brothers that administered the last four messages Wade Bob Louise and Aaron have moved into a thought now if they'll just keep on falling what that he's real and his name is Jesus not any other night but brother Dale let me understand what you're saying do you mean to tell me that before the world ever existed his name was Jesus but I told you slice Sunday I told you that what you're doing when I say Jesus your mind goes to a human flesh right when you say Jesus your mind goes to a human flesh but remember my Bible said woman sir the Godhead bodily dwelt in this man do we understand the birth of that baby that baby was Almighty God in human flesh mold I just don't understand who run the world while he was a baby laying in the cradle wonderful all he had to do speak it for the world ever begun and it's gonna keep running well with his name before he come into the world Jesus all right along musician but do we really see it or don't we just still like I said when you say Jesus are you looking at a flesh that's all you can see remember your prophet that Jesus was the only name God ever had don't you think you just seen all them theologians sit around listening to him make it in simplicity well I said something today and I want to make this statement she said something today and I don't remember I can't get it back exactly but you know we talked about keep confusing people by you know brother Dale you just confuse people make it simple you know that's the point but they'll make it simple there's a lot of difference between simple and a small amount of something not having very much how would you say that a lot of difference between simple and something that's don't amount to much you remember the wording I can't get it but we sure could but I'll try my best to express it these simple means something that has been explained right education is something that can never be explained people are this makes you say I don't learn Oh them things I want to stay self full praise God simple means it's been revealed may I say it like this a prophet ain't going that had the channels to go all the way to God and come back and bring to us a simple gospel and he said I'm a father I'm a son I'm here with me and he just explained the Godhead that mankind could never explain he made it simple the seals he made it simple you explained the white horse rider the red horse rider the black the pale he made it simple not small so everybody wants you to keep what they want to use another word Durst is not simple but it would mean you know don't don't get too deep with anything you're making it too deep Shilo thank you who got that one Aaron he must have been listening to me and nany talking today because that was word I was listening for shallow make it shallow brother Dale shallow means you don't have nothing right shallow means you went down as far as you can go simple means something that can be understood one true and living God brought to mankind so simple my prophet now started to him they're the most illiterate person and get born again that's not shallow that just went over the heads of most everybody on that internet system out there looking listening with coach they say brother Dale just too deep I can't understand you know what that means that means you ain't listening to the simplicity you won't live to be shallow man came into pulpit one day and having helped me I'm not against the others he said I want to tell you something he said I've got a great revelation here about God and he said you know who he is he's God that's really years he's caught then Ellis quit called we've we've got the message he's gone was he shallow who was he simple which one was we can't understand these deep things will ones your prophet preach it the most simple language that any human being could ever use in a theologian sitting there looking at him and if he's got any spiritual sense he says Lord let me have that for where I can explain what you showed me man one time told me he said brother Dale he said you got what I went to school to try to learn I said but you're not living it that way he was looking and they know who I'm talking about Aidan called his night he saw that a congregation of ministers would sit and listen I said it's not me they're listening to brother I said it's the Holy Spirit it's able to bring the word your education will never do it implicitly what's his name his name is Jesus because then I got ever title and you understanding of ever title and ever thought is one up in that one night oh the lovely name the name off-key somebody get that started okay go ahead brother you got it singing instead of replying water lovely money [Music] [Music] [Music] no is handsome we condemn that cancer in the name of the name above all names your name

the little ones they can believe they believe in your 9 Lord in what it means so whatever no sister that's the car horn it's art because they believe in Jesus anybody else level with her side for a long time let's just believe greetings in the name of Jesus Baba hydride enable Jesus Christ what we spoken up we lay our hands on top adopted from all these other signs about her feet from tiny Lord all these problems we just believe you by your stripes she's healed and that name Jesus is above every night no Damon in healthy would stand behind we love you Father thank you please hey buddy we

you know that name is your savior do you know we met your either do you know it has ever time see if you want to devil to get mad just thing and just start singing Jesus beautiful is beautiful he can't stand out but listen Church who lost it while ago and I got it back now the reason that the bride is part of the mystery is the simple little name of Jesus brother Theo wrastlin see preach here years ago and everybody might not have thought much about it with he put up Jes space us he said you take the u.s. offered off of Jesus and his name is Jess obvious a lot of people thought that was smart never not here I thought it was very smart because if you take us out of it you don't understand we are part of the mystery and part of his name what about it father we've tried our best to deliver what was on our heart Lord and just ask you to help us implica realize it's got to be revealed to us but that name is Jesus not just what the quoted or say it it's got to be revealed because when it's revealed to us we'll see that you are Almighty God and you change not you made yourself manifest throughout time to try to reveal yourself unto us and we thank you Father go with us home to give everybody a safe trip you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction and we thank you in Jesus name you're dismissed [Music] very even in the name do
