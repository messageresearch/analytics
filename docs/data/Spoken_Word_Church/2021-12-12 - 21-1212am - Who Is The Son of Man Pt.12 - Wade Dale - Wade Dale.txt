preaching wednesday night and then we'll keep announcing the rest of this pray for brother bob he's a brother andre's um preaching for them and remember the service next week all minds clear let's bow our heads just for a few moments speak to the author of the word the heavenly father we pray lord today that you would speak to us lord you've already spoke to us through song and the different things that we did lord we appreciate lord what everybody does in this church lord because we are truly the bride of jesus christ we are an exceptional group of people but we trust in you for everything that we do as brother john said we you give us 90 of that money that we earn and we should be good stewards of that give our ten percent and then use the other wisely for the kingdom of god father we pray that you'd be with us now take care of us be with us in the furthermore the service bless the ones that are sick lord anna's family and enrich the lord being sick there at home all the different ones leah jim's dad remember him lord they're doing this therapy this week lord may get to go home in a week or so we pray should be with him lord just take care of each and every one of us lord the satan would love to destroy us he'd love to get rid of us but lord until you're finished with us he's not going to be able to touch us so father we pray that you'd be with us in this service take care of each one in jesus name amen let's finish let's continue on with who is this son of man we'll read john 1 1. in the beginning was the word word with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not jesus told him before he left and we'll get to it a little bit later he said i'm coming back so you'll see me that the world will see me no more the world's not going to see the son of man until he's sitting in judgment amen we don't want to be that group of people to just see him in judgment we want to see him lor in the clouds when we get out of here right in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which led us every man that cometh into the world he was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received them to them he gave he power excuse me to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not a blood nor the will of the flesh look how john separates that nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's read hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings i would just not but a body has to have prepared me you may be seeing the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word i want to read you a little quote here on countdown they don't have this but that's okay i i thought about this and picked it up in the back so i believe that everything on earth reflects heaven i believe that because you see everything struggling for life is because there is a life that is reflected from see we wouldn't have anything refl to reflect from if god hadn't came here in human flesh all right that's my whole point and believe that when god made the man he started reflecting the smaller things such as the animal life then the next thing he created was something different that's just exactly the way bob the bible says he did it he made first the trees the botany life and he made man and then the last thing that ever come from the earth in the form of creation was a man nothing higher ever come because why here's my point it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which god is a man see god is a man so therefore it proves it and when god came down to dwell among us he was a man the son of man god is a man a man so it shows that the perfection of evolution was god which is a man so this son of man that we're talking about we can read many things and we've been reading many things and we read this scripture where the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that word had to come that person had to come that was being made flesh he had to come according to the word we've heard that before but listen that's the same way you come you can't come any way contrary to the word of god you've got to come the same way you might have cried and this one shouted but you got the same thing if you got the the holy ghost you got the same person amen you got the same man all right that man come to you called jesus christ and he's the one that gave his life for you right so wherefore when he comes into the world he says sacrifice and often thou what it's not but a body thou has prepared me so i'm going to continue on through this on the masterpiece number one we see that brother brown says the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene and i want to compile a few things how many times in the scriptures matthew mark luke and john that jesus was literally quoting the old testament word by word because he was that word he couldn't he couldn't misquote it but he looks at the people of the world of the religious people of the world that day and he says you're misquoting it because you've made your traditions the word and it's not that's what he was telling him right he said you you've made those traditions you've made them to where nobody can attain to this so we're nobody but remember as brother dale's always said the old testament and i'll read it to you a little bit later where jesus didn't come to do away with the law he had to come to fulfill the law and make it honorable in other words livable that's what this son of man come to do he come to make it so that you and i can sit in this church today and live what he lived he said oh no i can't do that well then you can't because you can't because he said be therefore perfect he said i am my father one and i want you and us to be one just as our father's one i want you to be with me i'll be with you even in you till then where's the separation part of this where's the part that we get all scrupled up that well i can't be this well i can't be that guess what we stop it ourself god will never stop you from being perfect but the world will tell you well i was born imperfect and i just am i just can't help what i do well yeah you can you get the helper inside of you and i'll promise you you'll quit the stupid things you're doing amen i mean we might do stupid human things but i'm talking about the crowsing and come not coming to church and doing all that i promise you you get the you get a born-again experience you don't have to preach about those things it's like brother dell's always said get them born again get them born again get that person inside of them and you don't have to preach to them you prove who you are by what's inside of you today this is the day of manifestation you're going to prove who you are the son of man proved who he was every day even in his natural life and we'll read it just a little while where his mother and they go to the to a wedding and and he turns water into wine he was you know he didn't get up he didn't get up that morning and go well i think i'm going to turn what no he just went with his mama to the to the wedding found out that the wine was gone and guess what he goes and turns the water into wine all right what about us like brother john's talking about even our financial life and it's kind of coordinated with our spiritual life somewhat but you have to be careful with that because you know job lost everything he had and he was a good guy but god restored him two-fold through the journey when his journey was over so we can't totally discredit that and we can't totally discredit that that the bible says lazarus was a beggar remember when he was in the bosom of abraham he was a beggar and he was poor so just be careful with that we need to we can be the richest people in the world financially and be dead is all get out in our spiritual life amen but it doesn't hurt to have both have a good spiritual life and a good financial life so i enjoy that that's really good brother john i like i said before you had some snitches that told that you had some more of that left so that's why you but he did a good job though a real good job that's why i think you know a good established church has got people that when if one can't be here another one steps right in and don't miss a lick don't miss a lick you just step right in and do the job this one can't do this and this one steps right in and does the job listen our training has to come from within amen our training when you've got a call in your life it comes from inside it doesn't come from external things remember what brother brown said daddy called him mama saying we don't want to be a preacher this daddy called him mama said we want to have god that called us and then it made mom and dad a little bit happier amen but we still have to live this life it's like brother john read the quote you know brother brown said if you were building a house and you knew the lord was coming continuing to build the house let's don't be let's don't be nuts because of that let's don't let's don't take it to the extreme we've seen that in the past that did happen brother john years ago these people run up all these debts because the lord was coming in 1977 so they just run up all this kind of debt guess what they still got the debt because you know it's what it's what you're thinking what you think in your heart that's what god knows he knows what you think in your heart doesn't matter what you portray everywhere else it's what you god knows in your heart okay i don't know where that came from but god bless you for that but anyway so but a body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene so you got pieces over here pieces over here i was trying to you know there's a thing in brother dale study that that shows a bible flipping open and as the bible's flipping open jesus is stepping out of the bible as the pages come up like this jesus comes up and there's an image of him walking out of the bible that's literally what he done he literally walked out of the word of god now see if if that's our example though come on people if that's our example when you and i get born again we should the same image should come as the words being opened and unfolded then it should be you stepping out of those pages amen you say oh that's for jesus i thought he'd come here to give it to you i don't want people to throw that in my face well that was just for jesus i thought he said everything's been given to me and i'm going to give it to you even paul picks it up and says heirs and joint heirs we get the same thing jesus gets amen because listen it's the same spirit dwells in us that dwells in him guess what we're gonna have a quickening we're gonna have a resurrection i'll promise you that but this baby had to get here and this is the time of the year that the people think that um that baby jesus was born well we know it's not and there's many arguments about that but we know lambs are born in april the prophet of god told us but we enjoy this time of the year because most of the time people are happy this time of the year thank goodness for just maybe a couple of days that people are happy amen same way with us and we give gifts and we get gifts all these people that don't want to celebrate christmas that's okay that's all right you do what you need to do luke 1 30 says behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus and we know that was a angel coming to mary look at number two and he fit every gift that's what we were talking about last sunday when the when the three wise men came to jesus they had three gifts and brother brown said that totally applied to everything in his life gold frankincense and myrrh and the same thing with me and you when you and i are born again i believe we get gifts do you use them because it's in that book that the pages it opens that's you now see i can't sing worth a lick or play a guitar but some of y'all can and some of y'all try not to that can you need to use your gift cause that's what god came as a man to give us these gifts as the three wise men wise men brought gifts gold frankincense and myrrh deity dedicated to death he was dedicated to die for me and you i like this next one down here at the bottom he wasn't nothing less than god he was god manifested in flesh he was the creator in his own creation he was the creator in his own creation by the creation for the creation so when gabriel came and told mary see listen gabriel was the messenger gabriel wasn't one that planted the no god did god created the egg in the in the sperm placed it in mary everybody got that we know that but it was he was created his own self which makes him in a few minutes the beginning of the creation of god i hope we understand that because you know what there's a continuation of that creation was there not a continuation of the creation if he's the beginning there's got to be more to come amen so now and he was being he was a being on earth a being of time which means that he must have had a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in god himself created a body for himself that by this creation he might save the lost creation that he created amen now look at number three who was this man jehovah lying crying like a baby can you imagine it we talked about it last weekend or last week that or week before last how that baby was god almighty in human flesh no less god amen no more god he was god almighty and human flesh and we know that in revelations 3 verse 14 this is to me and you and to the angel of the church the layout of sins these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god as we talked about before i believe this is the way god wanted it to be had there not been a fall you can think of it any way you want to but remember god when we were talking about eternal redemption there's a thread and god can't get away from that threat he used he has to be he's consistent thank god he's consistent [Music] everything he does over here has got a purpose and it's going to happen over here because you and i were supposed to be born without sex then we're born again without sex right we're born again without that desire born again not born of flesh as john was talking about but born of the spirit of god that's why jesus said you must be born from above everybody okay with that but but here's the beginning of the creation of god and we're a continuation of that creation and when and now here's a here's a baby being born and then he has to grow up like we're talking about he has to grow up but now he doesn't manifest that beginning of the creation of god the way he wants to until when until he dies because the bible said he had to die to what isaiah 53 he gave his soul a ransom so he could see his seed so when he gave a soul a ransom he came back on the day of pentecost there's when that rest of that part of that creation began to unfold peter james john 120 3 000 that's when he really manifested who he was but he had to be an example for that 30 years that he was alive 33 years he was alive he had to be the example the prime example so that's why we have to go back to that example every time if we don't go to the if we get away from that example i was telling brother richard hyatt and him this weekend we look at the example in and not saying here we go again not saying anything bad about people that don't see the truth but we're the only people that can make this bible live to its 100 truth like jesus did because you take you take this denomination over here they say well we're going to take a father son holy ghost baptism well see you've already tore you tore a piece of the son of man off amen god winks at the ignorance of that but that's not the fullness because it's been torn off like we're going to read here in a minute where jesus was handed a scroll a book which they didn't have books back then they'd scroll he rolled the scroll was rolled up and it was handed to jesus he unfolded it read it folded it back up and handed it back to the to the priest that's exactly what he done with his time here on earth he came here to open himself up to reveal himself and for everybody to read about him because all he had to do was read the old testament he came exactly that way he didn't miss it by one one sentence one word he was the very word made manifest so why can't you and i if we got that same guy in us it's that memory reason conscious affection it's that spirit realm that we have a problem with we all know that and that's the part we need to work on you listen let that soul out and let it live i don't care if it's even evil at least let it out quit pretending let it out you know what if you let it out then god can do something about it but if you don't let it out god cannot do anything for you amen but you gotta let it out jesus did he let it out he gave his soul a ransom for me and you he died so that we don't have to sure we see physical death but i promise you if you're born again today you'll never die that's what jesus was talking about he said you'll never die he said you drink of this water and you eat of this bread and we'll get into those things those symbols a little bit later on but he stood up one day and he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood he said you'll have no problem now it took a revelation to figure that out and we got that revelation because we know what that is we partake we're partaking right now the prophet of god tells us we're we're feeding and that's later on in the message we're feeding on the body word of what not the son of god the son of man because that man had a body and we can see that body listen by faith you ought to be able to see that body we know that brother branham saw him uh up in a a cloud or in a vision we know that but you and i should be able to say that's exactly the truth ain't nothing but the truth so that's what he looks like he looks like that almost to that he said so that's what we're looking at all right now look luke 2 verse 39 says oh this person see child grew and whacked strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him skip on down a little further and when he was 12 years old they went to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and i'll just paraphrase this just for a minute what they did was remember they lost him they left a 12 year old boy alone but there was a purpose behind every bit of that amen because what did jesus do see their problem was they went to the feast of passover probably maybe just to eat or just to kill one you know once once you had the the sacrifice killed you were done you didn't have to do anything else right you could just going back to the house well they were going on back to the house but listen where'd jesus go he went to the church he went to church and he went to church and he was asking them questions but remember watch this in same way in mind in your journey as far as being christians we're going to go from baby form to adoption because we've got to get to mount transfiguration and we'll get to it at the very end of the service here where he went up and was transfigured and god said here you him now listen it wasn't that you're not supposed to hear him over here but he was given the authority of that person to the world so the world can see it i like what brother brown said one time he said this message was not hidden in the corner this message went around the world seven times this message was vindicated and the whole world saw it same way with jesus folks listen he the everybody now we know the whole world didn't see him we know you know there wasn't television at that time but still the whole world that was around him was supposed to be able to see him and they did not see who he was so they're not going to see who you are listen if you and i was telling them this past weekend odd people i like the sermon brother brown preached called oddball because we are odd to the world you go walk through the world and you don't do the things they do and you think in your mind they crazy well they thinking and they mind you crazy so that's okay i like what brother brown said that sign on that said i'm a fool for christ and then he said the sign on the back said whose fool are you the man you're either gonna be a fool for the devil or fool for god so i think i'll just be a fool for god amen but jesus was always misunderstood anybody that lives so close to god like brother branham did was so totally misunderstood amen brother dale is one of the most misunderstood people in the message just telling you right erin everybody's everybody's talked to people they don't can't understand him they don't know what he's talking about he never bothered me none you know because i said lord fill my cup i'm going to open my cup up let me have some of that don't make me scared of it a lot of people are scared of this thing don't be scared of it it's for you it's the children's bread it's that gift that you've got amen it's the gift it's been given listen we give gifts at christmas time right now wait a minute you give a gift and expect one in return i'm going to close my eyes because some of you are going to say yup i don't know who you are if you give a gift back to return it's not a gift it's like brother john it's like a loan dave ramsey always tells you you know he says turkey dinner tastes a lot different at thanksgiving if your kids owe you money or if you owe your mom and daddy money so the best thing to do is just give it to them it's a gift if they pay you back surprise that's the same way with god he's not going to give you a gift and then expect you know what the only thing he's going to expect use it he's going to expect you to use it if he gives it to you use it now we know that people like elvis presley look brother brown said he had a gift he had an anointing he could have sent millions of souls to heaven but instead he took money and popularity and sent millions of people to hell that's the fine line so god gives you a gift folks you need to use it amen and use it for the glory of god let that thing out let use it but they found him in the temple but remember when he was 12 years old which we've already discussed that a little bit i want to cover this for a second i was thinking about it in in kentucky the other day you've got two scenarios jesus in the temple at 12. now watch your life jesus in the temple at 12 and jesus into in the temple at 30 or 31ish everybody got that there's there's in right here in luke 2 verse 39 then over in luke 4 he's growed up and he's now he's in the temple again there's two different scenarios this scenario what was he doing and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions okay god asking questions yeah that's what it says jesus was asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers but that didn't convert nobody but now you come over here to luke 4 and we'll read that a little bit later on in luke 4 there's some authority comes into being there's some maturity comes into being he's not in just the temple sitting in the corner no he's sitting on the front row actually he's probably sitting somewhere in a seat he's done made it up to this part this section that he can be handed a scroll and what they heard him say they listened to him same way with me and you you and i must have authority now listen brother dale and i were talking about this the other day power without character satanic okay but we we we stopped there and go okay power without character satanic no read the rest of the quote but power with character is fit to rule and that's why god had he had power with character so listen if he can have power with character so can you that's the gifts the statue of a perfect man he's given these things to you what are you doing with it he's giving you a christmas gift what are you doing with it amen so in other words jesus said must i be about my father's business he understood not what he was saying see even the people around even his own mama and father and brother brown said she denied the virgin birth by saying me and your daddy all right and so that just solidified with a lot of people around him that he was joseph's daddy right if you heard the mother say your father and i have sought you diligently right because we see over in luke 4 when he when this scenario happens in luke 4 somebody steps up and goes is that joseph's boy isn't that joseph's boy no that ain't joseph's boy if he's been about his father's business he'd been in a carpenter shop hebrews 5 8 says yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and all them that obey him we couldn't understand god without jesus christ being here there's no way to understand anything look at the old testament they didn't understand any of it they just knew to bow and go every seven days and kill this lamb and do this and don't do that amen but that ain't what that was about right but we had a promise in matthew 3 verse 11 that says he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire so we know that there's something going to happen jesus is going to have to be washed we see this is john have you ever took everything that john said now john only said a few things in the bible but if you can't put that brother branham's the same way he comes out of the wilderness how many times did brother brown tell you about john and you're going that happened to you brother brown you come out of the wilderness you love the wilderness you're not you're against all them people and you preach marriage in divorce you hate bad women amen and he introduced the son of man branham introduced to the world the son of man john the baptist introduced to the world the son of man amen john introduced the head so is the prophet of god in the end time that's why i believe he was so important not only for all the other things to put everything back together but he brought the headstone back where it could sit on the building and be a complete pyramid amen so let's read this right here continue right here real quick let's go to verse 15. brothers and jesus answered and said suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then in other words he baptized him remember jesus didn't need to be baptized but you and i do all right but it's a symbol of him washing the sacrifice and jesus when he was baptized went straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and low a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased you and i at the same time not when our baptism listen your baptism doesn't save you your confession to god is what saves you the baptism is just a good conscience to tell the world that hey in other words i'm being washed when i was literally baptized in 1997 cold day in january when i come out of the water i felt like there wasn't anything inside of me i just cried grabbed hold of june and cried cause that's all i knew to do i was so empty my thoughts were empty i wasn't i wasn't condemned with what i had done previously now wait a minute later on he came and did that but at that moment of time there was something around me that that kept that out of the way amen you know what it was i had done what god told me to do and then when you do what god told you to tells you to do you can point back at the word and say lord you said if i'd get baptized the correct way that you'd give me the holy ghost so about six months later he gave me the holy ghost amen you go by the prescribed way that god does it and he'll have to give it to you brother brown said take him at his word because he is the word if you take him as the word that's him and who is coming to you at the new birth the person of jesus christ inside of you as the holy ghost everybody got that right all right so now let's go where brother brown says i love this quote in the future home number five brother brown says this is my part of the earth in other words when jesus came out of the water john saw that dove coming down or the form of a dove and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed and from this part of the earth i will redeem the rest of it why he came from here his body was created it was 16 elements it was just like ours but it settled on a person that could redeem you and i were born in sin born right out of this soil that we're standing on amen but by the transforming power of the new birth we accept that part that jesus did for us and this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed and from this part of the earth i will redeem wade dale you got to put your name in there i will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest so what does that make you that makes you the word made manifest and the whole world i spoke into existence by my word hebrews 11. and satan has held it all this time but i've come to redeem it so much of it has made his body and i'm coming to dwell in it let's go to luke 4 verse 1. we read this a couple weeks ago but we're going to read it again luke 4 verse 1 says in jesus being full of the holy ghost now this is right after the baptism and listen we know that jesus didn't need the holy ghost he was the holy ghost he was if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily fullness full fullness of the godhead bodily which is what father son and holy ghost amen then he had all those three attributes he was all those three attributes but he had to receive an anointing to go preach his message and that anointing was the holy ghost you know brother brown could stand and preach preach under the inspiration of the holy ghost give us revelation and preach to us for a couple hours under an anointing and then he said he'd have to switch gears now folks he didn't call another holy ghost to come help him i mean come on but he moved over into another anointing of the same holy ghost so he could discern and heal not him heal the sick so that god can heal the sick but it's the same holy ghost it wasn't that he had to had to get him another one so jesus being the full of the holy ghost was the holy ghost he got an anointing of the holy ghost to preach the message he listen when he was 12 and 13 in that temple he didn't say a word except asking questions and talking to those people but watch here in luke 4 verse 1. jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being 40 days we we saw this before but watch what happened look at verse 4 he says it is written now let's go to verse 8 verse 8 it says it is written jesus is quoting him scripture quoting him scripture quoting him scripture now look at number 12. he finally took all he can take and jesus answered and said unto him it is said not written it is said in other words i'm telling you devil and there was something that satan felt not with the other two because he just kept coming back he just kept coming back but when jesus looked at him and said hey buddy it's sad i'm telling you i'm telling you thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and satan left him but now remember he only departed him for a season satan is very persistent i wish we were as persistent as he was amen luke 4 verse 16 we got to continue with this journey and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to church on the sabbath day and stood up for the read so see now he's standing up and reading now he's getting some authority but what is he doing and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah now remember they didn't have books they had scrolls everybody with me wake up a minute scrolls they had scrolls now that scroll was handed to jesus and what jesus do with it he knew what to do with it because he was a word what's the first thing he did can you read those words in there for me can you read them why oh well but when it's open can you not read that okay so that's what jesus did he opened the book now watch can you and i do the same thing because we've been given now not a closed book we've been given an open book we were handed this seven seal book with the sales off of it yes so that we can read what exactly is being done now he looks and when he opened the book he found the place where it was written in other words he found a place where he was it really about anybody else about moses read about himself now i didn't bring this quote but i quoted it to him in in kentucky last week and i'll bring it to you if you need it but all you gotta do is put in greatest anointing the prophet of god said the greatest anointing to ever hit the earth was not the first day of creation was not the day he created adam was not the day he became a baby it wasn't a shout in time brother brown said i believe the quote says he they're not they weren't walking on the walls he said the greatest anointing to ever strike the earth was when jesus sat down and opened the book he found his self in the bible see that should be your greatest anointing if you can find yourself in the bible how in the world can satan how can he do anything with you if you can find yourself in the bible and say satan do like brother um um not brother maloney but brother schrader he said satan if you're going to play in my mind you're going to look through my eyes we're going to read the bible and that means something because how many times has the devil said oh you don't need to read that i don't need to read that yeah we're going to read that and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written so he had he opened the book the son of man opened the book and he said the spirit of the lord is upon me pretty personal he didn't say us upon you he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive and recovering of the sight of the blind to say that liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord now that scripture he stopped mid-scripture because that pertained to his second coming he knew where to stop and he knew where to start how about me and you and he closed the book back up and he handed it back to the rabbi and i'm sure the old rabbi is like what's he fishing to say now what'd he say he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears listen the son of man opened the book the son of man read where he was at in the book and then he closed the book back up and never opened it back again until the end time revelations 10 1 mighty angel comes down with the book now remember it's not a book it's a scroll and it was open the seventh angel when he introduced the son of man that's the problem was they thought brother branham was the son of man no he was introducing the son of man just like john because they even asked even jesus said who do you say i am they say oh you john the baptist look how close that was he wasn't john the baptist john the baptist was close to him that's why they couldn't separate him saying we were brother brad but when that book got closed back up look he closed the book back gave it to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them in the synagogue were fastened on him he began to say this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears your ears john 5 verse 25 says look very verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god now watch hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear him shall live for as the father has life in himself so has he given to the son of man because listen the voice of the resurrection is the son of man who stood at lazarus tomb the son of man the son of man stood at lazarus tomb and said i am the resurrection and the life but remember it was the son of god that was inside that man that at that time had the authority you got to be careful with that because listen why did jesus one day he said now if you speak against the son of man you're okay you can curse him and whatever you want to do because that's how that's how peter got out of it i mean he didn't get out of it but you understand how peter got by with cursing he said but when the holy ghost has come when the son of god comes inside of that person and said you speak against him he said you're not speaking against him you're speaking against me and he said that'll never be forgiven you see the dispensation the dispensation changes now that's why now even we're going to read it not tonight today but a little bit later on where jesus said the son of man has power to forgive sins power on earth to forgive sins they said brother branham you forgive those people their sins he said that's not too far off right what do you say when i forgive you when somebody does something to you when somebody does something to you have you got the authority to say i forgive you and then god honors that i believe so i believe so i believe god honors that if you're truly born again and truly in the word of god then you absolutely because even if we praise somebody how many people have been healed oh my almost 100 how many people have been healed guess what the bible says lay hands on sickness shall recover then the scripture tells us if they have any sin do you read that part they will be forgiven also wow because somebody's praying for you somebody is anointing you somebody is doing what god said they've got an open book that we're reading from an open book listen the only way we're going to take a rapture is by an open book we can't take a rapture with a closed book a closed book you can have 13 000 different denominations built out of it but when you have an open book you can only have one doctrine not 20 not 50. i'm talking about message two brother joe and i were talking a few minutes ago this message people are so divided we are so divided over this and that and the other that's why we're still here 60 years after the prophets left can't get together on anything hardly but he and i agreed somebody is going to produce that son of man ministering just like jesus produced it and we're going to take a resurrection and a rapture amen i just believe that i just believe that somebody and as to be an astronaut on countdown is where that quote was about god being a man i believe it was brother brown said we have to be pressurized for the age are we pressurized i'm asking you sure we can listen we can be pressurized what did i read you all the other day about brother brown said in the church ages they did just enough to get by now that made them christians that made them born again that made them bride but they got just enough even your five wives and five foolish virgins what did the five wives say oh we got plenty we got buckets full of it no the wives said we've got just enough to get through we can't spare a dime we can't spare an ounce that's why we're going to make it but we're going to make it by the skin of our teeth amen won't be a flower bed to be it'll be a battle all the way up to the end amen listen to this john 2 verse 1. let's go to that one brothers now remember what was the first miracle jesus did we're going to have a wedding here in just a minute the third day there was a marriage in canaan of galilee the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage that jesus got an invitation and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus said unto him they have no wine jesus said in her woman what have i to do with thee my hour has not yet come his mother said unto the servants whatsoever he said do do it now this is the same woman that denied the virgin birth okay but remember she didn't have the holy ghost enter to lead her amen and there were set there six water pots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three perkins apiece and jesus said unto them fill the water pots with water and they filled them to the brim and then we know what happened but there was six water pots i can just picture jesus standing at the end of those six water pots there'll be one two three four five six and there stood the seventh water pot he was so full of wine until he just turned all them other ones into wine all the church ages saw and got what's wine symbol of the holy ghost right wine stimulation of revelation the holy ghost six church ages they had the water pots but in the seventh church age somebody somebody showed up in flesh amen now when it's not william branham now he was revealing the son of man but he wasn't the son of man the son of man is me and you collectively as a body not one person that's what you and i got to see you can't say well we've had many people preach son of man doctrines back back when and lord i remember one that they told me about that preached on the son of man and um he believed he was a sort of man i guess because he had multiple brides so but you see it always if you're not in the word 100 all right if you're just fooling around you can get you can get an anointing of god we know that gifts and callings are without repentance amen and you can preach because he was preaching on the son of man long before we heard this is the man way back brother claude weissinger was telling me back in the eight early 80s and said he was preaching it right down the line but he had girlfriends see somewhere they're going to go off but you take somebody that's purely in the word of god all of us here purely in the word of god we're going to produce that's not a man somebody's going to do it i'll keep saying that until somebody says it's me be it unto me according to thy word brother branham that ain't nothing but the truth amen let's go to john 3 verse 1 and then we'll we'll stop right here jesus said verily verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god and we know what he's saying this is the nicodemus very very i say unto themselves the man be born of water and the spirit nicodemus said what how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born he's talking about flesh verse six that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit marvel not that i said unto you you must be born again the wind bloweth where it lifts us and thou hears the sound thereof but can't not tell whether it come or whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered said unto him how can these things be jesus answers in him they're not a master of israel and know it's not these things very very i say unto thee we speak that that we do know he knew who he was and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness in other words i'm standing in front of you today you should be able to at least nicodemus feel this anointing that i've got you should be able to listen because he's continuing if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man has to send it now this really probably rolled his eyes around because no man has ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven wow as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so much the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world john 3 16 that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him believeth believeth in him not believe believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might through him through him might be saved no other salvation outside of the son of man listen even the son of man died on the cross and that took those old testament saints also amen they resurrected under that and he that believeth on him is not condemned that he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god what's the name of the only begotten son of god lord jesus christ and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil listen to this number six meanest man i know phoenix arizona brother brown said perhaps maybe he'd just go through with a sermon of you know jesus first doctrine did you ever know what it was you must be born again that was his first doctrine so that should be the first thing that we deal with instead of do's and don'ts brother brown said don't cut your hair don't no he didn't say that the bible said it it's in the bible what we were talking about in kentucky that's why i was making a point a minute ago we take this bible and you say well well if if you're witnessing to somebody and they said well and you just asked them a question said why do you cut your hair why are you able to cut your hair if you're saying you know the first thing you always ask the women is hair and dress why don't you wear pants and why don't you cut your hair well you know what sisters don't say because brother branham said cause they really don't care what brother branham said at that moment it's in the bible it's in the bible let me read it to you and then you know what i would say like i said before to someone i was talking about all these other things i said look i'm going to read you in the bible with words just plain read it right here now who told you you could do what you're doing throw it back at them say look if you can cut your hair and wear pants and be a christian or whatever what we always say hair and dress it's everything men cursing all the anything you can read in the bible i was reading yesterday where the bible tells us that this is the temple of the holy ghost not to defile this temple how can you defile this temple and god be dwelling inside of you how can you do that and that's like i told that man that had the beer that time and he said well i'm glad you got saved you know because he said he was saved and i said john what'd you get saved from and you really never say it like that same way with the bible you take the bible and you witness to people you take the bible and read the bible and then they say well that's not what my right church pastor organization that's what my denomination believes well why do you make it strange with me the way i'm living you're saying i'm strange and i can read it to you in the bible and you're telling me that some man got up in the pulpit and told you it was all right to do it you got that right there's something wrong if we can read it out of the bible that's why i said we have an open book we can read it right back to him they can't read where they can do these things they can't read where they can defile their body and still be born again they can't do that no way and that's not don't be a hard witness but if somebody ever nails you down just say look i can read what i'm doing out of here where do you read what you can do at find me the book because this one says holy bible i don't know where yours comes from amen all right let's read this and then we're done musicians come on we're going to skip a little bit forward and read this scenario here and then we're going to drop back give you something to think about matthew 17 verse 8 says when they had lifted up their eyes now this is on mount transfiguration this is when jesus was coming to the end of his of his ministry and they saw no man save jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead he's going to die a physical death in just like six months from now the son of man the person but he says risen again from the dead now watch and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elijah must first come they will quote you know what they're quoting malachi 4. everybody understand that why then say the scribes that elijah must first come because malachi 4 the ending of the old testament malachi 4 5 and 6 says that i'll cut send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord that's why they know elijah's gotta show up the jews do so adamant about that because that's their last bible that's their last bible remember their bible's not matthew martin luke and john and all the other ones it stops at malachi and these people are telling him the same thing why they say it describes it a loss must first come and jesus answered and said unto them let's stand to our feet elish truly shall first come and restore all things all things speaking of the end time while the prophet of god had to indict this generation for the second crucifixion amen you know what it was their traditions what crucified him the first time the religious people of the world what's crucifying him in the end time the religious people of the world i don't want religion i want salvation amen god bless you let's
