to present the peace of the spirit unto obedience and strengthening of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundance mercy has guided us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time amen than our gold that perishes though it be tried with fire may be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls the prophets have inquired and searched diligently of the grace that shall come unto you searching what are what manner of times the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the suffering of christ and the glory that should follow of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought on to you at the

black notebook open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy amen i am oh looking good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in ephesians 1 and we will then go to acts ephesians one acts three all right now i hope you have been downstairs and and looked over the uh the more or less the rearranging and redoing and painting and fixing up and everything and i hope you you know it it's enjoyable for you and like i always say if you don't like the way things are done you come up here and tell me in a hurry and i'll let you do it but while we're doing it we generally do the way we say because we're the ones doing it you know now if you want to change it you just let me know i'll be glad to let you uh do anything and turn things around but we certainly appreciate i appreciate my wife coming and she's been working this week when she's been dying with pain and everything i appreciate her appreciate lisa coming appreciate rachel coming and doing these things and you know anything else that anybody's done richard had to change a lot of things and you helped move things around so we appreciate everybody and the work that you've done to try to help us to get it uh more comfortable and into a better place all right also in doing it we've rearranged the taping situation so terrence has a copy now of a thing i want you to take and to fill out all right because we're we're trying to change the whole situation of where our taping is at and what's doing it we want everybody to have what you want of the tapes all right but we'll be giving you a copy of a paper so if you will put on there what you want it's listed you know like for your name and it's listed as like if you want the sunday morning if you want to sunday evening if you want wednesdays you've got to mark them all right because if these are not turned back in now and your name's left off don't blame me i'm giving them to you okay don't come up a week or two later my name ain't on there well your name you didn't turn in a paper okay everybody clear all right now see then that way then if you want the the tapes that are made and some of you do see some of you don't get the individual day-by-day services that we make you get them on the three months basis but you mark that but remember those now are not made and put in your rack if you're getting the like the mp3s which covers three months they are in the rack down in the richard's office thing and you get them yourself so now that those are not putting you right everybody understand it's not putting your rack on the mp3s that's the three months deal you've got to go in there and get them the only ones just be put in your racks will be the ones that are made on like a daily each one of the services so if you don't mark these put your name on it then we're gonna it won't be up there all right then if you want brother richard's tapes and things you've got to mark that too to worry that we can can put it into your rack all right see in that way if you don't want them and i'm saying to you i'm not throwing those stones i'm just throwing stones okay i'm throwing rocks not stones big old rocks i'm the one that makes the tapes and and i know things happen and things but sometimes i find a stack that thick in your rack and i know you're not listening because they're in the rack there's no way for you to listen and especially the ones i make say brother richards or myself now and then the richard makes the ones you know for the services but if you want to get just every three months of the services made here at the church that'll be one mp3 that you can take home with you and you don't have a whole lot of keeping up with so if you don't want to take put your name on there you know james colley write n-o-n-e underneath it none so that means we don't make any tapes for you all right everybody understand is it is it clear now you you've got to mark your name you got to put down if you want morning evening wednesday on the daily basis of each services and mark those and they will be put in your rack the mp3s for the every three months is in a rack in the wall and they're sitting there you got to go get them all right brother richards are the ones that i make for you you must mark that and tell me what you want and then that way i will make that according to what is handed in off the paper okay everybody clear okay if you're not clear then you know i'll repeat one more time the only time but there's no need of that but terrence will be giving these out as you leave the services or whatever or be given out among all of these others that we have here and forgive me for so many and forgive me this morning because some came in the office and said hi and i said because i had to totally change my services the ministry i got it like this this is message number 10 and i got errors pointing back that message number 11 is back that way so you know i changed the uh the services changed the thought we're going to try to bring and forgive me if i if you think i ignored you i was trying to get everything ready for for this you know today all right but just think on these things now uh let's see brother pickaxe will be with us on wednesday the 15th to press for us that weekend the sisters will be leaving uh this coming sunday on the 12th to go on the little trip they will be coming back in on the wednesday and getting back in time lord willing that something

we'll be going back up for another fishing trip and that will be on the um we'll start on the 16th going through on big thursday friday saturday so you know to the brothers if you want to go along let us know and we'll try to make arrangements on some things but you know you better bring your sleeping bag and things cause it does get cool it's not just so hot in the mountains all right i got it all done today is my wife's birthday so we will sing happy birthday to her later okay all right but it is my wife's birthday she is 49 years old i asked her this morning i said how do you feel she said 150 i said honey why stretch it one year it's just 149. i mean there's no need of stretching it for but we thank god for all of the years and the things that she's had and we you tell her happy birthday all right anything else i think i've got everything okay um if you don't understand these ask terrorists all right ephesians 1 and acts 3 okay heavenly father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the hour that we're living we thank you for you and lord we ask that you which has come and be with us and bless us with your understanding this morning as we read about you and talk about you you come on the scene and speak to us and you know how things has changed in our mind to where you know that we we switched around to try to bring it and and then being so pushed maybe and we might just try to take all day on this one thought lord so just bless us and guide us and forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness remember the sick among us because you said that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you we thank you have your way now in jesus name amen ephesians where we've been reading one verse three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places we're at now in christ all right according as he has chosen us were in him before the foundation of the world okay all of that is is done in him why that we should be holy and without blame before him in love not before the world we never will be holy before the world forget it we never will be holy before one another forget it we had a wonderful time last night in the bible study we really got into some things and we got three things covered and we covered a lot of territory and we were actually about 30 minutes late because of covering a lot of the things and i thoroughly enjoyed it i enjoy just talking about the word of god so you know we don't take that but if you want to come and be with us maybe that'll stir your curiosity we're on the works of the flesh and that's you know a lot of people think boy i tell you what i'm a christian i don't have no works in the flesh well why was paul talking about it to christians you know and i've told you before and i still believe and will believe until i can be changed on it i believe a christian a born-again christian can have works of the flesh now i don't believe there's anybody in the buildings murderer that's number one no or adulterous better not be if it is then you need to be an alder and get that straight because not you're the hindrance of the whole thing all right but what about speaking against your brother or what about spiritual adultery as i asked him last night have you ever asked god to forgive you for being in a denominational church remember you was in an adulteress of fire but i didn't know it you go down here on the side road and let them be shooting people and you're out there in the middle they're gonna get you for being a witness guilty by association if i was you i'd ask god to forgive me because we're trying to be in the word you know you know okay all right let me get out of that i'm on last night all right what do you say verse 5 having predestinated us war unto the adoption of children by jesus christ this is the only day that comes to the point right of adoption to be able to be completed so then that's what we're doing a jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved now let's go to acts 3 and we will read verse 19 and 3 through 21 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out now i know the background what this is laying on okay but you better listen to the scripture if your sins may be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord amen all right now that started on the day of pentecost we agree okay we're all right but there's to be a refreshing in this end time watching it and he shall send jesus which before was preached unto you now that's in the end time right shall sin jesus christ which was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the time of restitution which is the same word is restoration all right restitution of all things which god hath before spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since the world began you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now brother branham will use the word and if you're looking it up the word restoration restoration is not in the scripture all right just to save you the trouble of thinking about it and trying to find it because i did until i got wise enough to look and the word is restitution another word restore and all is there but the word restitution is the word restore and brother branham will actually use and be quoting the scripture the restoration of all things when it's saying the restitution of all things all right so then we know that he knows it the scripture knows it and if you've got a scofield bible drop down to the bottom of it it'll show you the great big long word it says this word rest this word restitution is restoration appearing only here and in acts 1 6. see because it's a very wonderful word all right now we have been talking about adoption adoption in three stages all right and in doing that we've come down through to worry that we're dealing now with the manifestation of the sons and daughters of the living god all right that way then you know you you have this to work that you can can study on it and you know i'm asking you on these things if you don't want the tapes to be made other than something you want to get on your own right none on it and that'll save me a lot of trouble trying to find out what to do with it just writing you know any and that'll save me the trouble okay now but we've come down to the basis of talking about the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god all right now in doing that then see we've reached a position in our message to try to have an understanding of of uh adoption and and like brother branham would say your your new birth is not your adoption your adoption is your placing into the body of christ the positionally placing and you know and i'll tell you up front and keep telling you the disciples and you'll see in a little while because brother brown said the headstone was rejected so we're tying together the headstone and the adoption in the manifestation of the sons of and daughters of god because we you know we've got to come to that place all right now then we've got to deal with doing that we've got to deal with the word restoration all right now if we're dealing with restoration it means whatever was here before can be here again right right restore okay but if we don't deal with it in the correct order we will miss the understanding of adoption but i believe your headstone is your adoption you know the headstone to an individual is that individual's adoption then the headstone to the unit of the bride of christ is the adoption and that is when you will see in full manifestation the sons and daughters of the living god but it'll be only like the lord jesus was because it's only basically less than six months not you can play with the words a little on it but there's only a short period from the time of amount of transfiguration to calvary seeing it's not going to be a long time we're not going to be around here 20 years with manifested sons and daughters of god capped off as a complete eunuch and all the things now it's going to be a short period how short that's none of my business brother branham said god will to anointed church and do in one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now all right so what have we been trying to bring see i believe and have talked to you that there are signs and wonders going on god is doing that through his childhood training of us as his children we have found that the tutor is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is the spirit of the father so it's not the father leaving the scene as a lot of people like to make it and us popping up on the scene it is the father coming into you and i to bring his nature the natural story is you hire a tutor to the children the spiritual story god's not hiring somebody else to raise his children he's doing it himself by the new birth all right then so we must deal with it and see that right where we're at now on the place that i'm talking about that romans 8 about verse 19 said the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of the sons and sons of god i always say sons and daughters because sons means you know it means sons and daughters but a lot of people want to make it well that's god it's only for the sons you know well i believe it's for the sons and daughters of god all right because we must come to that place and the growth development has been doing on for 40 years right all right you say well why is it taking so long i'll ask you a question you answer it brother branham said that he couldn't preach the statue of a perfect man until 1962 he said he waited 30 years but if he waited 30 years to preach about it is any problem with 40 years for us to obtain it well i got it when i believed well that's a good old baptist doctrine and glory hallelujah but i just don't believe it that way so then you know we just go on and stay on what we're at and try to believe it herself all right now let me get to a point that's why i said i'll probably have to break two messages for the point i want you to see now to restore is to bring back something that existed previously amen agree it wouldn't be restoration or restitution you if it was just dealing with what is here no i mean see now it's something that was here but has that went away and then it's coming back into place all right that's what the word restore means all right see to take you back to what it was originally and see then if we're in the days of the restitution or the restoring surely you would agree this is the end time you know and that we are in that place and i gave you a quote there from second handed role prince 1956 1206 the last words there now now is the day of the restoration of all things all right now now is the day okay now it's in here somewhere we'll get back to it after a while the prophet said when my brother when my sister was the sons and daughters of god to be made manifest outside of this day all right but it must be understood what we're talking about amen and forgive me because i'm trying to cover a little bit of the back and then come up and not just start right here but to try to get you to look at something and i know that i try to explain things and forgive me if i'm wrong but i'll keep on doing it i've tried to explain a lot of things over the years and people have labeled me as intellectual and say we don't need those things well where would you be if i hadn't explained them that's all i got to say you know that's no problem with me do what you want to but see i've tried to break things down the word that you won't have a loophole in your mind because i know what the human brain is doing just like trying to explain that on the day of pentecost and explain that brother branham said that he met people with a holy ghost 50 years before he came you know before him they received it 50 years before he come on the scene in other words in his ministries he said exactly like the day of pentecost well if you go one way on that you're running way off you go the other way you're running away off so what is it there was a split condition on the death pentecost there was 120 in the upper room they were tutored for three and a half years when the holy ghost fell it gave them where it says holy spirit on your pyramid it gave them all of these virtues all right but now the 3 000 outside heard one sermon and they received the new birth where did he put them according to the scriptures it put them as babes right all right which means it puts you right here at faith the new birth see and ours where the problem brought around pentecostal people and that's people in this message or whatever it's at they say oh we got everything you know what if you do what do you need to be around here for why don't you just go fishing and wait on the rest of it because days are not counted until you fish it okay but now listen see then better way then brother branham met people that received the holy ghost exactly like the day of pentecost not the upper room experience because i believe he was the only one standing in his day with it of an upper roaming experience you know the faith of the fathers all right see then he was trying to teach us how to come to that place and that's why it took 30 years to do it but see the ones he had met with the holy ghost the zeus street holy ghost was the baptism of the holy ghost exactly like the book of acts but not the upper room experience of 120 but the 3000 that received the holy ghost is a baby and brother brown calls the zeus street the prophet 464 to see a book go read he said the holy ghost came himself in the person of jesus christ but see then we needed somebody to come and tutor us back to where the disciples were and that's where your prophet starts all right so with that example in mind let's approach restoration by the way let's approach restoration let's don't say well i've got the message i got everything you only have the message that's been revealed to you all right is that plain enough if it ain't revealed then it's still letters on page that's right but if it's revealed it's come off the page into your heart in a reality all right now we didn't start out just because you think you come into this message and have read you didn't start out well i'm a manifested child that's right you know i've got everything no no i preach my own experience you do what you want to two years i was in this message seeking the baptism of the holy ghost reading six books a day and listening to two tapes had a pretty good understanding of the message but i never claimed just because i read and heard tapes that that meant i had the new birth i waited until i received an experience that matched the word in my experience back student in from their own i have been trying to grow in grace and knowledge i know everybody else says i come into the message that proves i got the holy ghost that's all right if you got it but what if you don't have it you ain't telling me i don't have it well that's a good reason to show you don't have it if you get upset with me i told a brother something one time he got offended and left here i was just telling him the truth i was telling him with people to go out you don't go acting like the devil commit adulteries and stuff like that and say you got the new birth don't tell me that i'm too old i'm sorry i believe in living the life of christ in the manifestation not living in adultery and claiming to be a born-again christian well i just got problems you know dave it had them yeah david didn't have a new birth either and he sure flat repented that he is what about you you say who are you talking to anybody that hears anybody here anybody out there that hears so you do what you're going to do you are anyway but if you've got the holy ghost and we talk about it last night if you got the holy ghost you know you don't have no problems with anybody correcting you oh yeah you may hurt hurt feelings yeah because we're human but when you see what's true is true then you're going to get rid of it all right so you get your feelings hurt what did the prophet say he said even what if the lord had somebody to say something to you to see how you would react amen you remember the man that was praying when brother adam had told him about the squirrels and that he killed that squirrel and the man prayed and said now lord to prove brother brown is right let him find that squirrel and boy him brother random and everybody there was upset because that man said and they asked the man later about it he said i don't remember praying that away well it was to try brother brown remember we've been trying to see whether we're sons and daughters of god and if we can't extend chastisement that's from here going that way then we're bastard playing language just you know forget it listen restoration deals then with restoring what has originally been here all right so now we must cover it in like stages all right to worry that you can understand it that's the only way i can follow it all right the new birth came on the day of pentecost okay according to joel 2 that you're promised that in the last days that he would restore all things now notice what joel is talking about i'll get to that just a split second now i put my finger on our word remember but remember the new birth was here and if you've received the new birth if you have received the new birth then it would have to be the same new birth that they received on the day of pentecost will you agree yes is it two or three different new births is there something he said what about luke what luther had the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth for his age all right under justification all right now they've been restoration we can say that we've been in restoration all right now there's a difference between the word restoration and reformation right luther listen luther had the baptism of the holy ghost for his day wesley pentecost etc that was restoration all right but the doctrine he brought was reformation because he was trying to reform the church he never wanted to leave the catholic church i've got his own writings he wanted to stay and reform the church of course he called it restoration but that didn't make it restoration because he was trying to work on something on reformation and brother brown said reformation was fine but he said reformation won't make it we've got to be into restoration reformation is to reform that's why i don't preach like the preachers of this message quit cutting your higher equipment afraid quit doing that quit doing that quit doing that and you're a christian i don't believe that i believe get born again you will automatically quit this thing it may take a little while for the holy spirit to get to you but you will quit if you get restoration but if you get reformation you'll set an appeal and holler amen but i wish brother dale would preach against them women you come into reformation and there's no restoration to it i believe in restoration huh you reform uh the old 55 chevrolet that means it's heated up with rust it's going this way that way it's all messed up and really there is no hardly any way to say you've got a totally restored 55 chevrolet because either that they've manufactured the parts if that's true and that can be put together and make it if not then you're just reforming the thing and you're painting over the rust and that's what people try to do in their spiritual life but restoration means to bring back they've got what these new new mustangs now they call it a restoration that's not restoration don't even look like the old mustang right that's man's words for what you're doing but restoration is dealing with what's been here all right the baptism of the holy ghost came on the day of pentecost according to joel it's promised that in the end time we would come back to a full restoration all right which would mean and you know your prophet the way he taught it that luther wesley and them received the holy ghost under their age which was only one stage of justification but that was the new birth of luther's day second stage was wesley's day but he said the third stage is the baptism of the holy ghost the restoration of the baptism of the holy ghost exactly like on the day of pentecost with the three thousand all right now you you follow me people don't take hear that see i placed it exactly so you say what i say and we're all right all right then see the three thousand start as babies so you and i start as babies whether you like it or not that's the way we start we're just babies that need to grow in grace and knowledge all right now then we can look at joel because joel made a key point that i want you to listen to joel said i'll restore the years of the cankerworm pineworm locust and caterpillar right right all right we know that from the restoration message of prophet brought okay they ate down the church and then started back in the days of martin luther all right to save time of preaching just get the point joy is dealing with restoration back to the faith of the fathers he's not dealing with restoration all the way because he specifically states what he's dealing with the years that the cankerworm palmorn locust and the caterpillar ate away it's specifically stating in the book of joel what he's dealing with he's dealing in restoration of what would end the church ages you know like in a book of acts and coming down and then ate away and then to restore back the church ages all right now he's dealing with then the faith of the fathers because the faith of the fathers was in the early church you agree yes brother ram actually brings it up with the ability for it to come up to the fourth church age because he said the pure unadulterated word goes into the ground under the fourth age all right so it was people up to there especially the messengers who had to me the way i see it believe it had the faith of the fathers which means they had the holy spirit right here pointing to the pyramid holy spirit down all right they had it like that see they had then the ministry of jesus christ the apostles had the ministry of jesus christ i've got quotes in here we'll get to in a minute i'm just giving an overall and then we'll drop back they had the ministry of jesus christ in the early church all right but they didn't have the headstone because it was rejected well the church of pentecost didn't reject it no but the people that it came to rejected and you better remember the people it wasn't today of pentecost were all jews so don't try to play games with me listen to what i'm saying it was a gentile church on the day of pentecost amen because it opened up but all of the ones in the upper room was jews so was the three thousand downstairs and so was the early church basically jews until a few gentiles at the house of canadians started coming in okay so now we're right that's why i don't mind standing up and preaching because when i say it just come and show me where i'm wrong that's not exalted that's true all right we see people say well we can't follow that line well why not because you've been taught something else but you see then there's the new birth then everybody that got the new birth got the new birth into the body of christ that it can be libel in lutheran wesley's day yes but they still receive the new birth but brother brown said on a zeus street that the holy ghost came back exactly like it was in the book of acts which means it took three stages to get to that point luther's age it was just justification wesley's age was sanctification but a zeus's trick was the baptism of the holy ghost the person of jesus christ coming back all right now we're still in the message see but then looking forward see if we can get to the faith of the fathers and we cannot get to the headstone without the faith of the fathers i don't care what you think of where you're born there and i told you the other day people say well i'm right up here i i've got to be here because i'm born in this age that's glad you'll see that's where i'm born there and that's as blind as a well forget it i just don't believe it that way i believe in the growing and grace of knowledge i believe you're born again by the new birth but that's a baby and then you start growing in grace and knowledge and we must come to the faith of the fathers but where do you hear that taught anymore in the message i'm serious what are you hearing the message anymore taught about the faith in the fathers so you listen and go out where does it talk where do they even mention faith of the father oh we're so high and mighty until we know what that's that's behind us it can't be behind you if it ain't restored all right if it ain't restored it can't be behind you then you'll see that according to the church age book this prophet was to do two things one turn the hearts and the children back to the faith of the fathers to reveal the thunders which is revelation contained in the seventh seal and be these divinely reveal mystery truths that literally turn us back all right so then that's what i'm trying to show you restoration the new work restoration the faith of the fathers but then there has to be a restoration of the minister of jesus christ he said well you just said that the disciples had the ministry of jesus christ that's right but the disciples didn't have a headstone it was rejected i know that's offensive to a lot of people because of their doctrinal issues but i can't help it i just believe what the prophet had to say see there's more to restoration than to just talk about the new birth there's more to restoration than to just talk about the faith of the fathers what about the ministry of jesus christ that was promised to come forth in the last days and if you and i don't have that ministry then we don't have the headstone playing language so what did the prophet of god say number two in your notes faith delivered them to the saints look down at the bottom you read all the way in between he's talking about deliverance of science being delivered today same faith that was once delivered to the sciences being delivered today middle paragraph you know the sun at rose knees comes in the west what did he say after life it'll be light in the evening time the holy spirit's here with the same ministry that was delivered to the lord by the lord jesus christ to his apostles the sign ministry of jesus christ delivered by the lord jesus to his apostles all right now the none of the apostles preached anything about the seals right none of the apostles now i know matthew mark luke and john mentioned some talks about son of man but get my point paul never talked about son of man peter never talked about son of man it wasn't written in the new testament because they didn't understand the new testament is not matthew mark luke and john the new testament begins in the book of acts so from the book of acts on you don't hear the son of man being spoken of because they didn't understand they only understood the fact that they must get born again and they must have the faith of the father you said well brother you're sure strong in making those statements 40-something years i've been preaching that ought to be pretty strong about what i believe you know and if you don't understand what i'm talking about come to me out of church we'll sit down and talk about it and and you know and we'll deal with it all right but look now what he goes on to say in the message number three of your notes jesus christ the same yesterday and jesus christ was saying 1956 225 paragraph or e60 he said i'm late you know see the more there's more things i do you do and then you must be saying i'm late for suffering said did the apostles do it the same ministry that jesus had the apostles carried on just like exactly like they always did now reading these to prove the point the disciples had the ministry of jesus christ and then we'll read that they didn't have the ministry of jesus christ so you're going to have to understand stages of what we're talking about all right then that would come into that point see it has to be a restoration look at number four on your notes uh paragraph 189 what shall i do with jesus 63 11-24 we got the vindicated word of god here vindicated proving by the spirit that he's received us and give us the baptism of the holy ghost we're baptized into the name of jesus christ the same gospel the same signs the same wonders the same ministry well that was only brother branham well you go ahead and do what you want to even the same pillar of fire visible among us showing the signs and wonders brother bosworth i'm wrong on quoting the correct one you get it in the right one out there brother branham prayed for a man's nose re-restored and a few days later it was restored brother bolivar was praying it was restored instantly do you argue over about it okay he wants the same gospel the same signs the same wonders the same ministry even the same pillar of fire visible among us showing the signs and wonders there is not an excuse no work and that's exactly what the bible said would take place in the last days and a call from malachi 4 to restore the faith that the children back to the faith of the fathers all right again back to the fathers again excuse me all right so then the disciples had the ministry of jesus christ but the cake and worm palm worm locus and caterpillar take that back all right then you started in martin luther he would the just shall live by faith and the message of martin luther of the just shall live by faith is a restoration message but luther made it a reformation message because he tried to reform with the truth of restoration and he went on run around said he would be standing here now not that sensible all right but you see then when we we get to the place of talking or speaking of like we are in the day of the manifestation of the sons of god from romans 8 19 see there has to be something about taking place in this end time that will tie together all that's been down through there and bring it into the headstone the to the church and that's be when as i preach another day when your name is just as good on checkbook as your father's and that'll be when the prophet would be talking about it the word and he's saying you know there's going to be a time come when you will speak the word and it'll create all right now we see the disciples have the statue of a perfect man i keep pointing to it they had this holy spirit going all the way down but they did not have a headstone it was rejected he said we'll prove it to you okay look down that number five on your notes adoption 1965-22 paragraph for you know paragraph 32. now we're coming right down to how many i believe this woman here raised her hand that she studied the pyramid you know the purity it never was kept was it listen to it never did have a capstone put on it they talked about the natural pyramid of egypt right what is it chiops is that the one is that the name of cheop it's the one there with no top all right they never couldn't find even find it they don't know what ever happened to it why why wasn't the capstone put on the headstone why wasn't it put on that cheots which is to be a a bible and stone right but why was it not put on the headstone on the top of it because he was rejected when he come he was the rejected stone that's right but it will be capped so now the headstone hadn't come it didn't come with the disciples they only had the ministry of jesus christ jesus christ preached the seals where's any of the disciples talking about the seals come on bridget bible matthew mark luke and john now come on matthew martin luke and john is not the new testament the new testament begun in the book of acts i don't care what your bible says you tell people turn to the first book of of the new testament they'll turn to matthew that's not the first book because the test of the test the death of the testator hadn't come the new testament being again on the death pentecost which is the book of acts well that's just a technical point so what's technical is true that's right that's right you know technicalities are true all right but now what are you talking about what was rejected this will hinge in for us later what was rejected the word the word was what was rejected but the disciples received what they could comprehend amen and a lot of things they said we don't understand he opened their understanding in the book of acts but it was only to what he had told them that's why they didn't talk about the seals and things because they were not comprehended right we didn't talk about them because nobody couldn't comprehend oh yeah we baptised we used to preach matthew 24 as a sixth seal but we put everybody in there including us all right but now follow what we're talking about look at number six on your notes i got 135 70 wicks of daniel 361 806 go right down to the bottom read all the way down through there and see how it shaped up and what it's been doing and there's come ministry among them just exactly like the ministry of jesus christ now what they got they got the thing in condition in condition now what's the next thing there's this rejected stone to the pyramid cut out of the mountain without what without hands god sent it do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the head of the is the head the capstone the very one that they rejected through this gentile church age is christ are you reading it so the headstone wasn't there they rejected it and christ was not cut and put in here as a viker or son of god or some great dignitary in the church he's the holy spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be christ's coming do you see it all right so the capstone headstone was rejected they rejected the word it's easy to see that the natural jew rejected the atonement the salvation but what did they really reject i thought we believed according to john 1 1 and on down to about verse 14 that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in verse 14 said and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us right so what did they turn down the word there he come riding into jerusalem on a white donkey right who the word right what but it was rejected he became the rejected stone right according to the scripture all right so now joel is dealing with what was down through the ages the faith of the fathers repeating what i said new birth is restoration of the new murk faith in the fathers is true joy to but then the headstone was rejected now let me give you a simple illustration i'll have to do that because that's the human mind those disciples could not comprehend even what jesus was saying because they did not have the new birth now even though he opened their understanding of the scriptures is that true the two on the road to emmaus he opened their understanding when they came back and gathered in jerusalem after his resurrection he opened their understanding of the scriptures but they did not have the new birth so no man can call jesus the christ except it be by the baptism of the holy spirit am i quoting the prophet so even though they had their understanding opened as to see things why would they in the book of acts say are you going to restore the kingdom to israel talking to the man that was standing there resurrected in front of them acts 1 8 read your bible they said you're going to restore the kingdom of israel he says you don't know what you're talking about you don't understand that this is a spiritual kingdom in other words it's got to be the baptism of the holy ghost that you've got to go to the upper room and wait they didn't understand what those seals of matthew 24 was no writer wrote of them so that was withholding from them even on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell on 120 it only quickened what they had of their understanding that was open are you listening so he opened their understanding up to a certain point about him and his resurrection and how he was the word and how that he was the fulfillment of the old testament and how he had to pay the price and all the things and even could open understanding of joy to tell him what would have to happen and how that it would go into the ground because remember when he was here he said that unless the corner week dies and goes into the ground and abides alone he could open their understanding to a lot of things but he didn't open their understanding to what those fields and things were i use that because that's one thing that everybody can relate to and then we'll see if we can get down that far in the message this afternoon that brother around calls the ten commandments the seals that's wrong with the ten commandments the ten commandments is god in a letter form right if i could have been quickened to those back there what would have moses done with it but all he could say don't commit adultery you know we'll kill you right are you listening see but see the rejected stone was rejected the word was rejected back there see you know i wrote it like this see people when i try to explain something then they come along behind me so well it's all just restoration i don't understand why brother dale spent so much time breaking this down he's done it over the years of breaking down these things you know and why does he come along now and try to break it's just restoration okay do what you want to i'm only trying my best to show us what restoration is and how this in stages now because you got the new birth don't mean you are restored to the faith of the father and because that you could have even the faith of the fathers don't mean that you have the headstone you have a connection to it because when you receive the new birth you have a connection to it there's nothing in between here this is all done don't try to lower that headstone just fill in the sides of it it's all one pyramid it's all the body of jesus christ and sure when you received the new birth you started a drawing from that headstone that's what's calling us upward but it doesn't mean it's here either because it's only here when god makes it manifest all right see what i'm trying to do is to tell us what to look for and to tell us what has been taking place and then to tell us about what will take place when the adoptional situation comes of the romans 8 and 19 that the world is waiting for in 1920 are worth waiting on the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god why because that's what i'm talking about here see the faith of the fathers is not the stage of adoption that the world is waiting for sure it was waiting for that because it must be in order to come but the real thing they're waiting for is the headstone which is promised to come in this day now i'm going to go ahead and say it then we'll read it later because i want to be in another message this evening i know but see the headstone i'm talking about is the word the things jesus didn't tell the disciples didn't quicken until there he comes to quicken in the last days the opening of the seals the things that are understood in our day is the headstone all right i'll get to it later what was it back there see everybody wants anointings and headstones and all like that they want to just put it all together but remember and i gave it to you some dedication is the message and brother brown calls those two tables of stone that come into the temple back there when solomon got it finished in 1st kings by 8 when it was all finished and those two tables of stone came in and took their place he said then the shekinah glory failed he calls those tables of stone the capping stuff that's what i believe they are the word of god the shekinah glory quickens that and makes it alive see the temple was set everything was ready brother and said every stone was in play he said everybody was standing in place he said but there was nothing taking place but he said the last thing is when them two tables of stone rested he said then that's your kind of glory fail that's all i've ever talked and all i've ever believed i'm looking for an anointing to strike this church yes sir that will take us in direction amen but if we're not in place it don't do no good right if we're not tooted and trained to the right place the holy ghost can fall all over the place and we can shout all our way and still die and go by the grace right i want to change i don't know what you're talking about so the world is waiting for for the what do it not unite with a church all right look at number eight on your note let's see all right let's read number seven we didn't get through that just to just show that it was rejected too i didn't read that one in a manifested songs of god 1965-18 paragraph 47 but as we grow from lutheran age let's be real and it's built up like this to a point and the stone on the capstone never was found they never did put a cap on top of the pyramid i don't know whether you know it or not the big pyramid of egypt has never had a top stone on it why the capstone was rejected christ the head said he was rejected but as we grow from the lutheran age baptist age methodist age pentecostal age we're right in up to the capping stone now see waiting and longing for that capping stone to set down the building's complete see all right when all this is done have not you read in the scriptures the stone was rejected of course we know that was talking to the solomon's temple but it but the rejected stone has become the chief of the corner but i'm saying this only to make a picture to you and now in the bible we're living in the last days the top of the pyramid the cross fishes of the cancer age in the zodiac in the time of the coming of leo the line in the capping stone and in the days of the manifestation of the sons of god in the bible see where we're at we're right at the end time so now he says that's what the world's waiting on right the capping style the capping stone will be what the word in the bride the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god all right now we're going down to number eight adoption preach 1965 22 the evening service paragraph 19 read all the way down get down to the um before why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost never poured out before all the old testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation it didn't it had to wait until this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men he didn't say one man these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ till it will till it'll join him and his church together so nice plain language that don't have to be interpreted it does go on down number nine abraham's covenant confirmed 61-10 he said look at today look what we see today and find out what did i say about the pyramid it'll have to be honed and so perfectly set in all the shavings and everything until the headstone will have to fit just exact just to fit just perfectly in see the rejected headstone will have to come back the covenant the life that was in christ is in the church the holy spirit all right so it's got to come back it's got to be healed all right see then there's the coming of the headstone or the word of god that jesus christ had but did not place in a disciple i wrote down here explain this at least okay explain this at length does everybody understand what i've tried to explain up to this point that even though the disciples had the new birth even though they had the faith of the fathers because that you didn't use novices to write the bible you know they didn't use none of the ones it was just a baby to write the bible they were all manifested sons of god for the time i said for the time all right and in doing that see then we've got to be restored back to where they were before we can talk about the headstone that's what people don't like to hear like richard said he said you've never heard anybody explain stature of a perfect man what brought around and said you must have these things it's not a choice that's not a thought you must have them if not then we don't even talk about the other but that's what people are saying well bless god and i receive that new birth i got that headstone now where's the bible and where's the prophet's message to show that from because i've just shown you up to the position to where that we've got to come back to the faith of the fathers to be waiting on the headstone now i believe individuals can reach the headstone above other individuals all right i believe brother brown was capped off don't you i believe he had the headstone because he taught us the word individuals can be there and i know people argued with me years ago about it that's all right it proved to be true that brother branham had the faith of the fathers he had the headstone and he died and went by the grave because i've had people tell me say if you've got the headstone you can't die now show me that in the bible show what the prophet's message brought around god i believe he had the headstone he died he's waiting on you and i yeah but that's where people just take their own thoughts see they think so much about oh when the headstone you just can't die when the body as a unit is pounded off by the headstone death is destroyed right to those right but it may just be a handful it may just be a handful of people the prophet might be right when he said one hour of estate so you better go find you another state all right but just trying to be true and write about it so i wrote down explain this at length one that the coming of the headstone are the word of god that jesus christ was now you know it was but he did not open the understanding of the disciples to what those seals and things were if he did your prophet was wrong when he said no man ever looked in on these things now come on did he make the statement he said no man ever looked on these things nobody outside the lord jesus had ever seen these things see then the adoption that the world is waiting on is the headstone to the church see it was promised let's read it matthew 17. what a promise is something that is spoken with reference for most of the time you know not every time but most of the time it's the promises is the future you know and so look at matthew 17 and 11. look at verse 10 while he turned in there and his disciples asked him saying well i didn't say the scribes to the lies must first come yeah all right now remember this is matthew 17 they're coming off the mountain from the adoption and look what he says don't tell the vision that no matter what son of man be risen again from the dead see in other words in the end time be risen again any disciples ask him saying why didn't they describe that elijah must first come and jesus answered and said unto them a lie shall truly first come and restore all kinds now at this time elias or elijah or john the baptist was already passed on so he said shall come and restore all things but i say unto you that now notice that's the capital letter if you don't believe that look back up in some of the others and you'll find that it's not as italicized that's italicized to the point because it's making a point but i say unto you that lies is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them see that allies see that elias which was john the baptist the all right elise double portion of elijah and elijah so at the time of jesus standing there three phases of the ministry of elijah was fulfilled so he says that elish has come already specifically stating john the baptist as being um isaiah what 42 is that the word it is talking about you know how that it would be and how that they would stand and have shoelaces out of the things from isaiah which was john the baptist is it 40 42 i think it's 42 all right but see but he said a lot shall come and restore all things so without brother branham coming to you and i there is no possibility you know the message he brought there's no possibility for you and i to be anything other than a member of the body of christ and that would be down so far until it's almost as heat away and i i like what brother random said and it always bothered me until the lord spoke to me about it when he said one day i mean it's about 62 61 somewhere right now he said the baptist just now become a denomination you hear me say that a lot and you wonder what i'm talking about i'm sure what you see the denominations had not died and dried up as you think they were honest-hearted people that were seeking and they were not responsible but when brother branham brought his message they became denominations that had died but brother randall was so nice because i'd look at it and say well brother branham the the baptist nominated 100 or 200 years before you see he knew what he's saying when they rejected his messages when they really died he said them denominations they know about this he says there's not a one of them that don't that's right then they said well i never heard about this you know they do they know about it just like today they know about this message oral roberts has got it in his college this message they've got it doing it you know with it all right let's go on but see then what then is the headstone that we are waiting and expecting to come we know it's not the physical coming of the lord jesus because we are going to meet that physical lord jesus in the air so the headstone is not the physical coming of the lord jesus then it is the coming of the word let's get this in there just like it was to the natural temple when completed by solomon in first kings 8-11 that when those stones went into place then the chicana glory fell what was the headstone brother and i wrote it like this brother branham explained to us what took place back there and what we are to expect all right he does because look at number 10 on your notes that's what i was quoting while ago so we'll read it and we'll try to get a little further and then we'll quit this is a message called dedication preaching elizabethton kentucky 1962 11 11 the morning service i like that 11 11. now you remember what that is i thought we believed that we were the level with our people right okay now we find out through the next chapter this is e30 and be e35 which is continuation right on true we find out true true in the next chapter where's that no t-h-o-u-g-h that when the builders found out that they were wrong it they had all the other stones there but the reason they couldn't get them together was because there was a hole left there was something that wasn't right all right now we already have the stones the stones god for ordained unless and yet and see and we've got them all the way from ephesus to ladies okay we're only waiting for the headstone that the builders rejected waiting for his coming the capping stone and when these great stones are confessions and we know that confession is a stone that's when it found its final resting place all right now he's in the temple right there's the kind of glory that followed those capping stones the stone not the corner the capping stone the main thing all other stones would have was of none effect until then but this main stone came in the headstone and took its place positionally for its resting place for that generation the glory of god filled a place where they were sitting and there's a kind of glory upon all the whole building and the glory was so great so the priests could not even minister because of their glory all right what was the last thing that was brought into the temple go back and read it there in kings the ark of the covenant right what was in the ark of the covenant the ten commandments now plus plus as i said there's five books that was written by moses genesis exodus leviticus number deuteronomy those five books were in set in little pouches that went with the ark of the covenant what was moses trying to explain when he said god is not over the sea that one should go there he's not up in heaven see paul says the law is spiritual but he said but i'm carnal the law the prophet said is the ten commandments the ten commandments is what brother brown said that jesus sowed you need those quotes he sowed the word of god is that true so there's nothing wrong with the ten commandments it's our understanding well that's just a book of rules no it's not a book of rules that's where you're wrong that's why it killed them that's why paul would say the law is spiritual it's the word of god amen we said our carnality is what's killing us he said the thing i thought was life i found to be deaf what the law but that's not what he said what he thought there was life in keeping the law to the letter but then he found out he couldn't keep it to the letter and he thought it was killing him all right see the ten commandments in the five books was the last thing placed in all right all right you said well we don't know about what that it would like to drop down to number uh 12 on your notes right down at the bottom of that page unveiling of god 1964 614 the pillar of fire paragraph 300. the pillar of fire appearing visible among those identifying that the message is right like it did at mount sinai remember before the true message come forth moses preached and he led them out of egypt now that's exactly what brother branham has done preached and led us out of egypt amen spiritually speaking all right and there before the real commandments was laid down and they put it for instance the seals brought in the brother didn't have any trouble making the seals and the commandments the same god came down before the people amen and prove that moses was sent from him all right so what will happen the word of god must be preached but why is it so rejected by the people of this message he said brother dale i know it i'm sorry i'm sorry that i have to say the thing that i have to say i'm a human mortal i like people i like friends and stephen wilson heard him say the other day on the tape i laughed at him about it but he said people think i'm mean but he said i'm a pretty good guy people think that i'm mean and tough but i think i'm a pretty good guy you know i think i'm really that nice i'm not just lambasting people see why has the people turned down the thing that the prophet was brought to bring which is the opening of the seals well they haven't turned it down we've heard every one of them my pastor prep played every one of them in the church still ten commandments well my pastors preached on them well send me the tape i'd like to hear it well he preached three sermons on it well that's what brother said one time about the statue of a perfect man brother said i got 60 something tight there on the statue of pretty man he said why my goodness i preached an hour and a half and i'm not making no joke or throwing off on him he preached all he could see in our night but he took brother most sixty supper sermons it took brother around 30 something years to be able to preach it but you see why is people against the opening of the word what do you mean brother daley preachers have a service now i wasn't the one that made this statement your prophet did he said you can't understand the seals until you understand daniel 70 weeks now he made that statement see nobody wants to tackle daniel 70 weeks they don't even talk about it oh yeah they preach we don't understand it it looks like one here it looks like something here it looks like this oh we preached it we preached it to our people we preached it we don't understand it the prophet said if you don't understand that you're 70 weeks you can't understand the season well yeah everybody said well we know all about the seal quite horse rider red or black just remember one thing the seal is the holy spirit the steel is not the antichrist the white horse rider writing off is the antichrist the holy spirit is the seal there's only one seal in the bible and that's ephesians 4 30 the holy spirit let's see people don't want that that's for another message that'll be wednesday night okay but listen the word has to be brought back to the church it has to be preached by the five-fold ministry amen well i just hear the prophet now you've been hearing the prophet 40 something years well where are y'all doing what do you all got we got the seed in the field amen okay we ain't went after all these doctrines it's kept us from it the seed in the field show me any of these doctrines that we followed after no why because the word was contrary to it you see what are you expecting brother dale i'm expecting just what your prophet said that what happened there in kings that after that word reached his place and was set in order and that shekinah glory then after that ark of the covenant was put in that place after those ten commandments was there the capping stoned then what did he say number 12 on your notes which is questions and answers preached in 1954 103 the evening service paragraph 145 and it goes down to the bottom he talked about the holy ghost he said oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all what all theologists fail to do in 2000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful the little remnant after the door the gentile church is clothed oh god will anoint a church then he who's filthy let him be filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous still and he who's holy let him be holy still and god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will be taken place not only that then but he's doing it now see he's doing it now he's anointing the church there'll be a final anointing that's forming a letter reign be a final anointing that one day will strike when the the mechanics comes to the dynamics because the mechanics will be a refilling of the holy spirit am i quoting brother brown you on tape if you don't know where that's at send me an email we'll send it to you anything i'd like to say other than statement other than my own private something i say and i will tell you when i say that you send it to me we'll sure find where the prophet said it but after the door the gentile church is closed god is going to anoint a church well you're just looking to the future no because i've told you if we don't get the present the future is no good if we don't stand here with the faith of the fathers there is no headstone doing us any good as i've always made the statement and i know people wouldn't like it that's all right everybody in the world today could have the faith of the fathers seven billion people that would still not change one body because it did not right that's why the prophet's message had to come right he had to stand at the faith of the fathers read the statue of a perfect man and see if he didn't say that's where he was standing fill me up lord with these things that i may teach others apostles prophet evangelist pastors teachers that are bringing into these things into the body of christ reading there where he says that the disciples had the least little nod from god and he said i went down there to pray for that baby or something like he said i waited he said well when i got that little nod he knew where he was standing come on musicians i'll just have to continue this to seed as you see i'm looking for something great to happen but i'm looking each day at what is taking place and i made my statement and i believe it there are some people that can be standing with a headstone fully revealed and standing with it capped off but that don't mean the change is coming because of that that means they can teach us how to attain now here is my point i've made it over and over and over and i'll keep making it let's don't make something so small and so little that we can just all stumble into it you know we're in the message we understand restoration but let's don't make it so great until nobody can reach it well the only one that could do anything like this is brother branham so we're waiting on him to come back to tell us this you see to me you missed the scale on either end right but to me i wanna just walk day by day i want to be like the like uh solomon them was i want to get everything ready because that's not what solomon done david couldn't take care of it remember too much blood too much fighting too much killing solomon set out then to provide even though david had brought in a lot of the material solomon set out to get everything ready and he wanted that temple built when he got it all finished he said there's one thing missing get
