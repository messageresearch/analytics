[3:21] follow along with me because I want to
[3:23] make sure that you understand what I'm
[3:27] talking about and the way I'm trying to
[3:30] present it
[3:31] all right whether you agree with me or
[3:34] not that's between you and the Lord
[3:36] that's that's not for me to decide of
[3:40] what it's just for me to try to present
[3:43] what I see and believe and then for you
[3:47] to hear that and listen to the wording
[3:50] without trying to figure it out you know
[3:53] and it's like I was doing son do you
[3:54] want to add them could just do the part
[3:57] of the thing and part of the thing part
[3:59] of a little things showing because if
[4:01] you run it all up everybody's going to
[4:02] run the whole way down to the bottom
[4:03] they don't got it figured out where you
[4:05] go and what you're doing everything you
[4:07] ain't even started so this stay with us
[4:10] and listen to what I'm saying and then
[4:14] you know you can decide from that okay
[4:16] father we thank you for tonight and we
[4:19] pray that you would just bless us with
[4:20] your presence in your love we've prayed
[4:23] to you we've sung to you worship to Lord
[4:26] now it's time to talk about you in the
[4:29] word and father especially in the word
[4:33] of the hour that we're living in to
[4:36] where we're coming to the end of all
[4:37] things we ask you to just forgive our
[4:40] many sins and Lord we know and realize
[4:42] there's many sicknesses among us in a
[4:45] different ones Lord that are having the
[4:47] problems we pray that you would just
[4:49] come on the scene you promised it
[4:51] we believe it and just forgive our sins
[4:54] Lord because I know that there's so much
[4:56] dire in our hearts and our lives that
[4:58] hinder us from being close to you and
[5:01] just have your way let your grace be
[5:04] sufficient we need you so much we love
[5:06] you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen
[5:10] John 1 in the beginning was the word and
[5:18] the word was with god and the word was
[5:21] god i hope by now we're getting a point
[5:24] of understanding that our thoughts of
[5:27] beginning our thoughts of like things
[5:31] like creation and creating is beginning
[5:34] to come in to a mouth set this way
[5:37] without being derogatory to a scriptural
[5:40] form because you know we can have our
[5:44] thoughts and ideas and say well i
[5:48] believe this and that's what we were
[5:49] told in this what we believe it this is
[5:51] what the word says and this is the
[5:53] meaning of the word but i'm not trying
[5:56] to get none of that to us that should
[5:59] have been taken care of but i'm trying
[6:01] to get our thoughts and ideas into the
[6:05] basis of the word of god being revealed
[6:08] to where we can walk therein and
[6:11] understand it from as I say scriptural
[6:15] understanding then then getting
[6:19] scriptural understanding is different
[6:22] from words that we try to come up with
[6:26] all right in our thinking because we say
[6:29] well that you know we just said what the
[6:31] word says well we found out a long time
[6:34] ago that that's not exactly right and
[6:36] there's a lot the word said that we
[6:38] didn't know it said a lot of things were
[6:40] said we thought it said something out
[6:42] you know all right until we found out
[6:44] the truth but just think about it so
[6:46] then right in the beginning was the word
[6:48] Word was with God in the Word was God
[6:50] the sign was in the beginning with God
[6:52] not to people you are your word and your
[6:57] thoughts in your mind and that's what
[6:59] I'm trying to get you to think about
[7:00] it's not here's the word had caught it
[7:03] said it said in the beginning was the
[7:04] word
[7:05] and the Word was with God like well
[7:08] here's God and is with it and then it
[7:10] says and the Word was God now you've
[7:14] come back to the middle and your
[7:16] thoughts know as the same was in the
[7:18] beginning all things were made by him
[7:20] and without him was not anything made
[7:21] that was made in him was life and the
[7:24] life was a lot of men and the light
[7:26] shyness in darkness and the darkness
[7:29] comprehended it not right now here will
[7:33] be where I thought will be picked up
[7:36] from far tonight Romans 8:28 and we know
[7:44] that all things work together for good
[7:46] to them that love God to them who are
[7:49] the called according to his purpose
[7:52] all right the ones that are D called
[7:55] that's just a special group of people
[7:57] now the Bible is not written to
[8:00] everybody it's written to the born-again
[8:04] Christian it only tells the sinner that
[8:08] he's lost it's not written to him it
[8:10] just tells him he's lost all right now
[8:12] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[8:16] predestinate to be conformed to the
[8:19] image of his son that he might be the
[8:21] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[8:25] whom he did predestinate them he called
[8:27] it whom he called them he also justified
[8:30] and whom he justified them he also
[8:33] glorified
[8:34] what shall we then say to these things
[8:37] what can you say to them if God be for
[8:40] us who could be against us you may be
[8:43] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[8:45] reading of the word now as I said that's
[8:48] what I want to do is try to make sure
[8:52] you understand me I listen back we did
[8:56] to the services Sunday and I'm satisfied
[8:59] with it but I don't think it is with
[9:03] everybody to thinking of it because I
[9:06] kept drilling the emphasis over and over
[9:09] that I was talking about the mind of God
[9:13] all right and now to me oh like a cover
[9:19] we covered there with two creations
[9:22] right all right now what do you mean two
[9:25] creations there were two creations there
[9:28] was a spiritual as we call it that had
[9:32] no beginning none of it ever had any
[9:35] ended I gave you the paperwork for
[9:36] showing you what I was talking about but
[9:39] then we gave you the other side to show
[9:41] it as to be that everything that had a
[9:44] beginning has to have an ending to it
[9:48] right so now when it says here that we
[9:52] read in John in the beginning see now
[9:55] immediately we've got a problem because
[9:59] the prophets words were taking his words
[10:02] because we're opposed to do that and he
[10:05] said anything had to begin and got it
[10:06] ended well now you take John one that's
[10:11] why I read it over and over and over you
[10:14] read it back to me what in the beginning
[10:19] was the word word had a beginning so it
[10:23] means it'll have an ending then is that
[10:32] your understanding though immediately
[10:36] you see that our thoughts are not his
[10:39] thoughts then with that in the scripture
[10:41] my ways are not your ways my thoughts
[10:44] are not your thoughts my thoughts are so
[10:45] much higher than your thoughts to your
[10:47] thoughts are not even in the picture
[10:48] never brother Colley speaking on that
[10:51] probably 35 years ago but think about it
[10:57] so when we read in the beginning we know
[11:02] immediately we've got to pick up some
[11:04] other thought because we cannot take
[11:08] playing language and follow that
[11:10] Scripture go do it say in the beginning
[11:14] was the word the Word was with God and
[11:16] the Word was God so then the word had a
[11:19] beginning God had a beginning now we're
[11:24] in a terrible shape church I know that
[11:28] I'm um
[11:30] I don't know the best word I'll just
[11:32] call myself very bit and hateful that's
[11:33] alright I don't mean to be but I mean to
[11:38] be true flow to try to tell you the
[11:40] truth now if I ain't gonna tell you the
[11:42] truth I'll just quit and forget it
[11:44] and I never tried to PT patter about
[11:46] anything I've always just been blown
[11:49] about what I believe and I've always
[11:51] left it that way and I'll leave it to
[11:53] you if you don't agree with it come to
[11:55] mend let's talk about the only thing
[11:57] I've ever asked you don't go tell
[11:58] everybody how much you owe it to me
[12:01] first you know yourself how people have
[12:05] done that here and they got in trouble
[12:07] by going and not doing it in the right
[12:10] way so come to me and let's talk about
[12:12] it right now we talked about getting a
[12:15] point now we talked about to creation
[12:20] that I said one was God coming into and
[12:25] the Prophet said that God was his first
[12:28] creation well that ain't explained that
[12:33] one it can't be the wording we're
[12:38] reading of what we think that God had a
[12:41] beginning and it definitely can't be to
[12:45] her that brethren said we can't believe
[12:47] that God created Jesus and Jesus created
[12:50] everything else you remember that he
[12:54] said it can't be that so then we've got
[12:56] to clarify in our mind and get our
[12:59] thinking in the right order so when to
[13:03] me that it says and God was his first
[13:05] creation that really just simply means
[13:07] to me that God is coming into
[13:11] manifestation to where that he can be
[13:13] understood that's as simple as I can
[13:17] make it to where he's coming into
[13:20] manifestation oh whatever you want to
[13:22] call it you know changing formed and
[13:25] morphe etc but it means that it was like
[13:30] this piece of paper you can't see it but
[13:32] then here it comes into being now the
[13:35] paper was here all the time you just
[13:40] couldn't see it it had to be changed
[13:43] see for you to be able to comprehend it
[13:46] all right that's what I believe about
[13:47] God and how he's unfolding himself and
[13:52] revealing himself to mankind and it's
[13:57] being done in such a marvelous way that
[13:59] I tried to show you the thing and had
[14:01] that divided that were one side would
[14:04] have a beginning the angel had a
[14:06] beginning the world had a beginning
[14:08] Adams body had a beginning Jesus's body
[14:12] had a beginning yeah so you got to deal
[14:16] with each one of those all right now
[14:19] that's what we tried to bring it down to
[14:21] show but the soul of Adam had no
[14:25] beginning God had no beginning all right
[14:33] see then that way the soul of the Lord
[14:36] Jesus Christ had no beginning the Spirit
[14:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ had no
[14:40] beginning it was part of God and
[14:46] remember I brought that down to one side
[14:48] but on the other side you got the world
[14:50] you got angels you got all kind of thing
[14:51] and then I covered it this using God as
[14:53] I said there a moment ago
[14:54] the body of Adam wasn't eternal the body
[14:58] of the Lord Jesus wasn't eternal our
[15:00] bodies are not eternal let's see Adam
[15:05] was waiting on something to where he
[15:07] could be brought to the place right
[15:09] which is still waiting on us but Jesus
[15:14] didn't have to wait on nobody cause he
[15:15] was Almighty God but he redeemed the
[15:20] body not that it was sinful but it had a
[15:26] beginning all right and see then that's
[15:29] what he's doing to you and me by the
[15:33] revealing of his word he's redeeming
[15:36] these bodies he said well I just don't
[15:39] see it taking manifestation look like
[15:41] going the opposite direction well that's
[15:43] where we're going the same way again
[15:45] you're still running back to your mind
[15:47] you're running back to your thoughts
[15:50] what did you understand that with what
[15:52] are trying to bring see to creations
[15:56] that creation that started in genesis of
[15:59] Adam in his soul never had a beginning
[16:07] it was eternal no brother I said blessed
[16:12] be his name the breeze eternal life into
[16:14] Adams nostrils all right now we know for
[16:19] a certainty as I say in the Lord Jesus
[16:21] his soul spirit was eternal all right
[16:25] never had a beginning but his body did
[16:28] and had to be made eternal and it was
[16:31] all right now by that we can come to the
[16:35] place that our bodies can be redeemed
[16:39] now if we have eternal life tonight in
[16:42] the soul the soul is redeemed right it
[16:47] has eternal life or not it can never die
[16:52] but we're waiting the redemption of this
[16:55] body and the problem is the spirit that
[16:57] motivates between the body and the soul
[17:00] right because that's where our troubles
[17:04] of that because are where you memories
[17:05] your reason your concepts and etc gets
[17:08] involved and you try to figure things
[17:10] out
[17:11] all right now watch tonight what we're
[17:13] talking about let's divide God's mind
[17:17] and that's really something but what
[17:21] else we're going to say let's divide
[17:23] God's mind into two parts and I'll try
[17:29] to illustrate it like a human being now
[17:31] I'm not a doctor so if I get it wrong
[17:32] and I got the front in the back in the
[17:34] back the front now this you just
[17:35] straighten it all out and tell me later
[17:38] how long the wood in your brain you have
[17:43] parts that are conscious if your five
[17:49] senses work through through your brain
[17:51] huh but then you have unconscious part
[17:54] about you and that unconscious part
[17:57] about you keeps your body working while
[18:00] your sleep and you know keeps your heart
[18:03] going and then it's dividing that brain
[18:06] that mind
[18:08] all right then you can go only totally
[18:10] into the sub-conscience
[18:12] which goes back to show that you don't
[18:15] think with your brain goes all the way
[18:18] into the subconscious goes into the soul
[18:20] okay now I'm quoting brother Branham all
[18:24] right now but what I'm talking about
[18:27] let's look at that is two parts we were
[18:35] talking about and we're still back
[18:36] before the foundation of the world and
[18:37] our thinking we haven't come down any
[18:40] we're still back there that's why we
[18:42] went through that your name was written
[18:46] in the Lamb's Book of Life you know the
[18:48] book of the life of the lamb slain
[18:50] before the foundation of the world all
[18:54] right we'll never be written there okay
[18:57] simple that's what the word says that's
[19:01] what the Prophet says okay now then we
[19:04] went through that in Jobe that it speaks
[19:06] about where were you when I laid the
[19:08] foundation world Morningstar saying
[19:10] together
[19:10] sons of God shouted for joy and brother
[19:13] and said I gave you the quote could it
[19:16] have been when they saw their name
[19:18] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[19:22] he's putting them together run as an
[19:28] event in heaven or wherever you want to
[19:31] take it to whatever will keep dealing
[19:33] with it a minute in his mind but we're
[19:37] going to try to divide that mind because
[19:40] to me if we don't divide it when we
[19:42] don't know what in the world we're
[19:43] talking about now but then we covered
[19:48] them that to Genesis 1:26 man being a
[19:54] part of God and read around them I gave
[19:57] you the quotes and all where he said he
[19:59] was created in the image of God he says
[20:02] created in theophany and said he had
[20:06] control of the animals in that spiritual
[20:10] man and that spiritual man was the very
[20:17] life of Almighty God because it was in
[20:19] the image of God
[20:21] all right now think about it I've got a
[20:26] quota running over today forgot to bring
[20:28] anything but brother Adam is talking in
[20:31] simple language in our power phrase it'd
[20:33] be just a hard difference but it'd be
[20:35] pretty close he's saying if you want to
[20:38] know what God looks like look at man
[20:42] because he created them in His image and
[20:44] he said if you want to know what man
[20:46] looks like look at God because he
[20:49] created in His image right so there
[20:53] shouldn't be any arguments or what this
[20:56] was or that was surely by now you've at
[21:00] least can see that I believe Almighty
[21:05] God in the apne form looked like Jesus
[21:13] Christ that's what your prophet said
[21:18] Moses saw the back part I'm quoting
[21:22] brother Branham right
[21:23] and he said Abraham fed him a cave and
[21:29] he's talking about the same man all
[21:34] right so that Genesis 1:26 man waves
[21:37] dealing a lot with that and I'm trying
[21:38] to back away from some of the spots
[21:40] deliberately to leave it where he can
[21:44] have something to preach on God if I
[21:46] covered he's going to be running out you
[21:48] know I don't mean that running out and
[21:50] then debris said I just mean we'll cross
[21:52] each other too much so I'm trying to
[21:54] cover now a creation of God the subject
[22:00] has been for water quite a while own one
[22:02] God series that's what it puts a guy one
[22:06] guard series trying to understand God
[22:10] well nobody can't understand God he's
[22:14] the spirit he sees that's our old days
[22:16] of thinking that was when mama believed
[22:20] that hell was eternal and cold as him
[22:24] that's when the old preacher said
[22:27] there's got to be a Trinity
[22:34] and you know yourself you consume some
[22:36] of that you desire that people to get up
[22:39] and say the Bible says there's three
[22:41] gods
[22:41] you say well words of that I can't show
[22:45] it but but it says it me because grandma
[22:49] told me it said all right I love my
[22:52] grandma never didn't either but that's
[22:54] fine but grandma didn't know the truth
[22:58] right
[23:00] see our thoughts about what we think
[23:02] about things should change with the
[23:06] understanding of the word of God that
[23:09] had been brought to us by way of a
[23:12] prophet messenger
[23:13] don't you agree to that don't you think
[23:16] our thoughts should change he's not
[23:19] going to change him he said I'm God and
[23:21] I changed not so we don't worry about
[23:24] that but there's a lot of things we have
[23:26] or the change is like I said we read the
[23:29] Bible it says in revelation 3:14 that
[23:33] he's the beginning of the creation of
[23:34] God we're gone ahead of beginning cause
[23:37] it says right now he was the big that
[23:40] Jesus was ending up I said we've got all
[23:44] that to deal with in our mind and listen
[23:47] I'm a human being
[23:49] the reason I make those statements and
[23:51] to get you to clearly understand one
[23:53] time I know what Satan deals with the
[23:56] human mind and how he worked on those
[23:59] minds one because I got one when I know
[24:06] how it works online you ever seen
[24:09] something I mean really seen it your
[24:12] head God to reveal something to you I
[24:13] mean you really seen it and like one god
[24:16] you really seen one God you just
[24:21] couldn't wait till you run over to the
[24:24] neighbor or somebody or friend and
[24:25] started explaining one God the time you
[24:29] got there you done lost all the
[24:30] understanding is that right you lost all
[24:35] the understand you know how it was
[24:37] explained to you the ghost shows doesn't
[24:41] hit reveal all right but now listen if
[24:45] we can talk about
[24:47] the mind of God and how that in his mind
[24:53] now this is where I won't be going til
[24:54] you get it listen in his mind he's seen
[24:58] everything that would ever happen in
[25:01] this world you agree to that are you
[25:06] going to limit your God and say he
[25:08] didn't understand this or didn't
[25:09] understand that all right that settles
[25:11] that now there's no argument shouldn't
[25:13] be shouldn't even be so much under c'mon
[25:15] I think it was in there from that
[25:17] ourselves now why watch the point what
[25:21] are you trying to do trying to make
[25:22] yourself something because you're trying
[25:25] to say what if I had if I get a print it
[25:26] will come on unless you explain it
[25:30] mental problems
[25:32] I'm not sarcastic with that I'm just
[25:34] telling the God's honest truth
[25:36] I would have fought you years ago and
[25:42] you would have to over the ideas that we
[25:44] had that we thought were right right the
[25:53] dentist gradually see it come unfolding
[25:58] until we're losing those thoughts and
[26:01] taking his thoughts to see him what you
[26:08] see in God's mind now we'll say in a
[26:11] part of God's mind in a part of God's
[26:13] mind he could see the whole world
[26:16] because he ever person that would ever
[26:19] live everything at that everybody sigh
[26:23] one time he said how much Tyler that
[26:25] gnat would make I never didn't know they
[26:27] made Tyler but that's alright you agree
[26:32] that he's infinite to be able to do
[26:35] those things
[26:38] now then in that part of his mind he
[26:43] would see who would want to be saved and
[26:46] who would not want to be saved he would
[26:53] see why you wouldn't want to be saved or
[26:56] why you would want to be saved
[26:58] right what do you see everybody in the
[27:04] world that what that shouldn't be any
[27:09] problems to our understanding is to try
[27:15] to highway understand an infinite God
[27:17] who would know everything before
[27:19] anything ever moved or started or
[27:22] anything that in his mind he would know
[27:28] all things but then you know that most
[27:33] of you that have been with me over this
[27:37] you've been here a year
[27:39] you know this statement is always made I
[27:42] don't want to be just in the mind of God
[27:46] because at the same time
[27:48] I'm in the mind of God there's a lot of
[27:50] sinners that are living this world right
[27:54] along with me and they're in the mind of
[27:57] God to know that he knows what you're
[27:59] going to do so I don't want to be in the
[28:03] mind of God I've heard people say that
[28:05] you know preachers not all great blessed
[28:07] God in it something to be in the mind of
[28:10] God in the mind of God he saw everything
[28:17] he saw the people going to hell when
[28:19] hell's not eternal he's that strong
[28:22] enough speaking that he saw who would go
[28:25] Darden is not even it was made for the
[28:26] devil and angels and and people are
[28:28] intruders going there but what about it
[28:35] I don't want to be just what he thought
[28:39] of because what if he thought of you not
[28:45] be any term yes but I do this I approve
[28:53] of it you're getting into evidences and
[28:56] remember there's not but one evidence
[29:01] right
[29:02] we believe in shouting we believe in
[29:05] speaking in tongues we believe in crying
[29:06] we believe in everything we believe in
[29:08] the guilts we believe in order but
[29:10] there's only one evidence
[29:11] and what is that evidence whether or not
[29:15] the spirit in you agrees with order now
[29:19] watch
[29:20] continually agrees well you know
[29:23] yourself had a lot of people that agreed
[29:25] with a word for a while right you
[29:27] remember in your mind somebody that you
[29:29] was in your life and they went up good
[29:31] for a little while but then they just
[29:35] fell away so then that spirit was not
[29:38] there to keep them guided into that word
[29:43] so then the thing we've got to deal with
[29:45] is whether or not we can believe the
[29:47] word well what do you mean I believe
[29:51] everything in that you believe there was
[29:56] three gods in there when you first read
[29:58] it right did you get another book
[30:03] brother Larry actually got to with that
[30:05] no it's the same Bible you know what I
[30:11] don't say this because of it being that
[30:14] way Brett around and luck Scofield
[30:15] Bible's right that was his preference he
[30:18] used Thompson chain I know when he used
[30:20] different ones and he used all kind of
[30:22] but he liked the Scofield we you know
[30:24] what when I was in the Baptist Church I
[30:26] was that was to me in that way it was
[30:28] expensive my first Bible that's why he
[30:32] gave me the one but my first Bible about
[30:34] and not because I knew a brother branham
[30:36] I just had heard people talking of
[30:40] references from it that that it was a
[30:43] Scofield Bible was a good Bible one
[30:46] reason I like it one thing I like about
[30:48] the Bible the Scofield Bible you don't
[30:51] matter how big it is it can be heist
[30:54] that size it can be that big everything
[31:00] is on the same side of the page so if
[31:04] you remember and looking for something I
[31:07] was looking for a quote today and I knew
[31:10] exactly on the quote where brother
[31:14] Branham would say what I'll knew that I
[31:16] wanted him to say well because it was
[31:20] locked in my mind and that's good so you
[31:24] read you read
[31:25] we hear right over here johnjessy you
[31:27] got and that's the reason I like them
[31:30] all right
[31:30] that's didn't personal but listen then
[31:37] are we only going to deal with
[31:44] Redemption things like that are we going
[31:50] to only deal with it as to dealing with
[31:52] the mind in the part of thinking that
[31:54] God knows all things how are we going to
[32:05] put redemption into that well he knew I
[32:10] would want it run that's good
[32:13] but just remember until judas iscariot
[32:18] come to a certain spot he was doing
[32:21] pretty good
[32:24] there's nothing against him but then
[32:29] when he had to make the choices in life
[32:31] you remember Jacob and Esau the story
[32:34] and remember that's in the
[32:36] predestination right down below where
[32:38] we're reading in Romans that Jacob have
[32:41] I loved and Esau have I hated
[32:43] now that was before either one of them
[32:45] ever come into the world what may God do
[32:49] that what made him choose Israel as his
[33:02] people are you in
[33:10] I'm talking about an infinite God who
[33:12] knows our very thoughts and and
[33:14] everything and while we're thinking
[33:16] while you're thinking now he knows why
[33:18] you're thinking that you're not hiding
[33:20] one thing from him I'm tickled to death
[33:23] I'm one thing for sure I've seen enough
[33:26] I'm talking about in the spiritual realm
[33:29] I do not want the gift of discernment
[33:37] I've seen enough with what
[33:39] I'm got what if you knew everybody never
[33:43] what they were thinking and that
[33:50] wouldn't work would it
[33:51] you think he'd be good but you'd wind up
[33:55] trying to buy lottery tickets and win
[33:59] the race horse trying to get the
[34:01] newspaper a day ahead of time alright
[34:03] that's the way you're thinking would go
[34:05] because you're human you remember they
[34:07] told brother branham said brother
[34:08] branham you tell us were that all that
[34:10] and said we'll put it all into the work
[34:12] of the Lord he said he knew they
[34:15] wouldn't do it and he wouldn't tell him
[34:18] so they drilled and they drilled didn't
[34:22] find it because they probably had a good
[34:25] idea vicinity that he was talking about
[34:28] but you know what happened somebody else
[34:31] oddball coming instead on gusher all
[34:33] right he said because he knew they were
[34:37] not sincere
[34:38] went about knowing that I don't want to
[34:41] know that I'd like to thank you love me
[34:43] I do I'm I could think hello
[34:47] although the devil gets on the other
[34:49] side and he says they don't do it they
[34:50] don't do it they don't do it to it
[34:52] that's all right we have some good
[34:54] arguments okay but now listen see then
[35:00] one part of God's mind would be thinking
[35:03] of everybody in their ways and what
[35:09] would take vice well then how would you
[35:15] do that by having your name written in
[35:22] a book of the life of the lamb slain
[35:23] before the foundation world how would
[35:25] you justify that to come out as to be in
[35:28] right how would you have a point back
[35:32] that far to think about Morningstar
[35:34] singing together sons of God shouting
[35:36] for joy and remember God don't
[35:43] predestinate by his desires well now
[35:49] what are you going to do I asked you
[35:54] many things to do a lot of times and you
[35:56] know if you do it it had people but if
[35:59] you don't sign I still ask it we've done
[36:04] it one time I remember years ago if I
[36:07] was you and planning on listening to a
[36:08] lot of tapes you know what I do I would
[36:11] just go to this tape running now is on
[36:13] the seals I would just go to the first
[36:16] message after the seals and I start not
[36:18] listening or series from their own to
[36:20] the end of the message I give you a good
[36:23] thing to do you just listen to them in
[36:26] series one after the other and see if
[36:31] not all of those in that series is
[36:33] dealing with I always was eternal if you
[36:43] was eternal read listen to them
[36:49] he said well well I just don't have time
[36:52] to do that you you got time to go to
[36:55] Walmart honey
[36:56] and they're making it and I was really
[36:58] making it nice for you you just call
[37:01] them up or do it on the computer
[37:03] and you just write in your grocery list
[37:06] Lisa names life and they went up to what
[37:08] is a different game from Kroger they
[37:10] went up to Kroger the other night just
[37:11] pulled up in front of the sign and
[37:13] rolled the groceries out and set them
[37:15] Tripp the thing they never got out they
[37:18] tripped it they set the groceries in the
[37:19] car and close it up and they drove off
[37:22] well they're Walmart's doing those
[37:25] things so you know you got good use of
[37:27] going to Walmart now alright but nothing
[37:30] to do that to get that tide out of you
[37:33] for a second
[37:35] right now we see there's got to be a
[37:39] part of God's mind that we can't
[37:43] comprehend are you willing come on if
[37:54] you've been in this message for 10 years
[37:56] and listened to the tapes and things you
[37:59] know about the mind of God and you know
[38:03] about before the world begun and what
[38:05] happening and all of the things if not
[38:08] you ain't listen to the message so just
[38:10] forget it
[38:11] you ain't going to anyway what about
[38:18] that the Prophet gave this one I didn't
[38:21] give it to the image for I gave it the
[38:24] other day but I'll reread it what about
[38:27] on Chrysler mister God revealed priest
[38:30] in 1963 728 now God's secret mystery he
[38:37] had before the world begun now back in
[38:40] the back part of God's mind there was
[38:49] something he was going was trying and
[38:51] was going to achieve he had a motive in
[38:54] doing it in order to let himself be
[38:56] expressed they got it up there so you
[38:58] can read it what about the back part of
[39:02] God's mind I have trouble with the front
[39:06] don't you keeping up with life and in
[39:08] predestination zand but what about a
[39:11] prophet being able to go back in the
[39:13] back part of God's mind now may I state
[39:19] it again I don't want to be in God's
[39:25] mind as to just be what he thought of me
[39:28] being and life and pre destinations
[39:35] that's 90% of the people right today are
[39:37] still hung on predestination brother
[39:43] Branham said foreknowledge comes before
[39:44] predestination and we just read it in
[39:47] the Bible
[39:48] but it said a way that I won't get at
[39:51] this time but I'll get back to it it
[39:53] said very funny though it says those who
[39:57] he for no why did he put forward no why
[40:06] did they he not say those that he did
[40:09] for you or something why does it say for
[40:16] no we might find out a few things for
[40:22] the listen as you see that's what I'm
[40:26] trying to do Sunday dwelling with in
[40:29] God's mind he saw everything that would
[40:36] ever be in this world ever person that
[40:39] would ever be saved
[40:40] now listen and so everybody that would
[40:45] ever be saved he saw all of the days and
[40:47] life of mankind he saw all the people
[40:51] that would give their lives for the
[40:52] gospel he saw all the way down he saw
[40:54] all the way into the change of these
[40:57] bodies in his mind he saw all the way to
[41:06] the fifth seal Jew the tribulation
[41:12] millennium the white throne the future
[41:19] home and he winds up saying behold I
[41:26] create all things new if he knows that
[41:36] if he knows it like that and understands
[41:40] it that away he would understand who
[41:45] would want to be saved and who wouldn't
[41:56] well then why would a prophet speak of
[41:58] the back part of his mind if you want to
[42:04] call it front part back part two parts
[42:06] whatever you call it you do that I'm not
[42:08] a scientist nor doctor but I just got a
[42:12] little sense the in that part of his
[42:17] mind he could understand everything that
[42:22] would ever be right I'm not asking you
[42:30] to agree I'm asking is that right but he
[42:33] would understand that by his mind he
[42:38] would know you would want to be saved
[42:41] and the other people wouldn't want to be
[42:43] Sutton he would know ever better that if
[42:46] not he's not God all right we got that
[42:48] solved then we'll read the quotes in a
[42:51] minute we want God don't predestinate by
[42:55] his foreknowledge
[42:56] I mean predestinate by his desires dude
[43:04] he predestinated by his foreknowledge he
[43:12] predestinated by his foreknowledge
[43:14] notice design could he desire to
[43:17] everybody to be saved so then whatever
[43:21] you talk about predestination and that's
[43:23] what the people message you're still
[43:25] hung upon those times I'm predestinated
[43:28] I'll be higher I know I get in trouble
[43:33] let's look
[43:34] they say brother branham's tell me that
[43:36] I'll be there I said you better remember
[43:38] he went the other way one time too and
[43:41] he saw peoples are just don't crow when
[43:47] somebody knows what you're talking about
[43:48] because he went to the regions of the
[43:51] laws right and saw people was that where
[43:55] he saw you know he saw me in heaven cuz
[44:00] I love the word well what about all
[44:03] these doctor well I think brochures got
[44:06] it down there right he's got
[44:07] soles and you've got this of that if it
[44:08] ain't would pick up two lowers and then
[44:10] we'll get some you've done proved you're
[44:13] off the word you've done left the word
[44:17] I'm getting one point and that's all I
[44:19] want you to understand what I think in a
[44:22] way I think if there is a back part of
[44:26] God's mind is he had a secret mystery
[44:31] that would deal with his coming into
[44:34] being expressing him in his attributes
[44:39] Nicole and I'm gonna keep quotes or
[44:41] don't don't
[44:42] told me at the same time he would know
[44:45] about the Seventh Seal the coming of the
[44:52] Lord is that the same part of the quote
[44:54] from Christ mystery I'm put it all in
[44:58] that one about not leaving anything out
[45:00] I'm just trying to show you that all
[45:02] fish but what is that back part and
[45:09] brother Randall says iron cry so much he
[45:11] said God had a plan and he was going to
[45:15] see it achieve what the plan of
[45:19] predestination and the things of
[45:21] foreknowledge at the world that you see
[45:22] that everybody's involved in can see
[45:24] those son what is it there was left to
[45:32] be a mystery
[45:40] what do you think see then you'll see
[45:44] why I don't want to be just part of his
[45:45] thinking because part of his thinking
[45:49] could put me in the wrong blood ish but
[45:52] if I'd be a very part of that one that
[45:56] done the thinking see there's the great
[46:02] mystery the mystery he had a plan now
[46:10] may I ask you this question I ask it the
[46:15] other day and just backed up mask you
[46:17] again will everybody receive eternal
[46:25] life
[46:29] no they won't they won't receive eternal
[46:33] life everybody one so then what is it
[46:36] it's not far then to her that's God's
[46:39] foreknowledge he knows all about it once
[46:41] your desired all the things but get the
[46:43] point could this thing wind up a little
[46:48] bit closer to talking about his mind
[46:53] than to just think about what he thought
[46:55] of you realize now let me ask you and
[47:03] you're gonna have to think so listen
[47:04] nobody awake enough a sinner is not in
[47:14] any way a part of the attributes of God
[47:23] now don't make it an attribute that we
[47:26] got lost
[47:28] don't do that please don't don't even
[47:31] spend your time trying to figure that
[47:32] out
[47:33] that one attribute was he know he knew
[47:39] that if he gave us free moral agency he
[47:44] knew what we would do
[47:46] is that agreeable what about a situation
[47:52] of Adam and Eve with eternal life in
[48:01] their soul and that's a quarter bless
[48:04] Venus times when you argue run around
[48:13] you mean God knew they was going to fall
[48:17] yeah he knew if he put them on free
[48:21] moral agency that they'd fall right so
[48:26] don't get your head blowed so big that
[48:29] you think you can't stumble and fall
[48:32] because I am NOT talking about and I'm
[48:35] never called a demand Eve I've taught it
[48:38] this way
[48:38] you can't put Adam in Hell now not with
[48:44] eternal life
[48:46] don't put either either because she was
[48:49] in Adam and t apne I'm quoting brother
[48:51] branham she was part of Adam so they
[48:56] don't try to fool with doing something
[48:58] just think about what I'm talking about
[49:00] God put Adam and Eve in the garden the
[49:03] way he wanted to put every one of us
[49:14] which he would create us a body to live
[49:17] in and then he would place the spirit
[49:20] within us and the soul within that
[49:24] individual it would be eternal Adam soul
[49:29] was eternal then the Tree of Life was
[49:38] there and we go to the Tree of Life and
[49:42] partake of the Tree of Life in you
[49:45] remember how over in the story a little
[49:47] bit it was said we got to put this man
[49:49] out lest he / take of the Tree of Life
[49:53] and you better close your mind just to
[49:56] her - you're thinking of how wording is
[49:58] it because the Bible says
[50:00] lessee protected the tree of life and
[50:02] live forever
[50:04] it does not say he turned on even ever
[50:15] one of us could have walked upon this
[50:16] earth in the tree of life would have
[50:18] been there which is one problem there
[50:22] was another tree put there too because
[50:24] he knew that we're not going to happen
[50:26] he knew not going to happen that way
[50:28] he knew bringing Adam and Eve into being
[50:30] would be great but he and that would be
[50:33] his glorious to get his worshipping the
[50:35] things that he knew man was going to
[50:39] follow he knew you and I was going to
[50:43] follow problem was see we never reached
[50:49] like Adam so when we fell we did fall we
[50:56] fell to death he said when I got in the
[50:59] field book were written go ahead I know
[51:02] the quote brother Adam said Adam fell
[51:07] from eternal life to death that's 100%
[51:10] correct he never reached he turn alive
[51:16] in his body so he fell from coming to
[51:22] that place your prophet is still right
[51:26] that's why I love the word all right but
[51:30] get the point in brother Dale you seem
[51:34] to be pointing to something else back
[51:36] there why would it be that the morning
[51:42] stars would be singing because in the
[51:44] sons of God be shouting for joy and the
[51:46] name was being written in the Lamb's
[51:48] Book alive before the foundation of the
[51:49] world the Angels was worshiping because
[51:52] as I brought out Sunday those angels
[51:54] would would have an immigrant I'm
[51:56] because they were created for the
[52:00] purpose of being to those that would be
[52:04] heir of salvation that's why the Bible
[52:09] says you won't judge angels why I know
[52:12] brother random quotes two-thirds but you
[52:13] by
[52:13] most of the third so you ain't arguing
[52:16] with nobody just telling you how it is
[52:18] is it two thirds or thirds some of them
[52:20] fail and we're going to judge them the
[52:24] ones that fail but the ones that didn't
[52:27] follow you ain't going judges they gonna
[52:29] be happy in heaven too glorious because
[52:31] they're going to get to be there they're
[52:33] going to get a reward one day because
[52:39] they kept their job and done it Emanuel
[52:44] is great don't think he's going to do
[52:47] away with them here but around says when
[52:51] we get over there
[52:52] them Angels will be just as real as we
[52:57] are do you need that courtroom
[52:59] alright listen what are you talking
[53:01] about what's your point my point is
[53:04] don't get locked in on in your mind in
[53:08] his mind and that's as far as you can go
[53:11] to just get into the mind and think
[53:13] about the rediff t or the pre
[53:15] destinations are the things just keep
[53:18] going on back go back to the quotes you
[53:25] want them where the Prophet would say if
[53:29] you wasn't back there you never will be
[53:33] back there you need to know I don't say
[53:39] something that I don't have what about
[53:42] it you seem to be placing it there's
[53:45] maybe a little bit more to in his mind
[53:48] than just his thinking I'm glad you
[53:51] thought of that
[53:51] it's wonderful now you're at least
[53:54] listen
[54:01] but you see you can't do that until you
[54:03] itself realize that by that new birth
[54:07] that you have in your soul is Almighty
[54:14] God to give eternal life to your soul it
[54:19] wouldn't he kernel didn't come he was
[54:22] back there all souls were I still got a
[54:27] lot to preach Zeki LinkedIn forwards
[54:33] that what did we're all shoulder mine
[54:37] but we're about souls with your time as
[54:41] you see if you lock in your mind you can
[54:44] go back and see that in your mind in his
[54:46] mind he could see ever show that would
[54:48] ever be and the choice that show would
[54:51] make and the way that troll would be but
[54:55] that's not it's planning purpose you
[55:00] realize that there will be a lot of
[55:02] people receive eternal life
[55:07] who is virgins
[55:09] Phil Phil to Old Testament Saints all
[55:15] because you are his child not cause at
[55:25] what they do
[55:26] it will predestinate any of them by
[55:30] God's desires or anything
[55:33] don't predestinate by trying to be good
[55:37] we just innate by foreknowledge you'll
[55:41] come out to the right story what are you
[55:44] talking about Bill Adele I'm talking
[55:46] about one time there's a group of people
[55:54] on this earth that are not just
[56:00] born-again Christians not just good
[56:05] people but they're the very children of
[56:09] Almighty God
[56:13] they're his offspring and they existed
[56:23] with him before he had any foreknowledge
[56:26] of the world you wouldn't listening I
[56:32] wouldn't pay an attention I brought
[56:34] everything as deliberately as I could
[56:36] that those names written in the Lamb's
[56:40] Book of Life was for the foundation of
[56:43] the world or anybody ever come into
[56:45] being morning stars sang together under
[56:47] God shouted for joy that was back there
[56:49] before anything ever coming to being
[56:50] Genesis 1:26 man let us make man you
[57:00] know but that's going back too far no
[57:02] it's not so you're not going far enough
[57:05] you're stopping yourself by
[57:09] understanding this the mind you've got
[57:11] that part in your understandings now
[57:15] you're getting it right and praise God
[57:17] for that don't lose it
[57:20] but now step a little bit further if we
[57:27] think redeemed means when we were a
[57:33] sinner and we was redeemed that's good
[57:35] but just remember redeem means to go
[57:38] back where you come from did you know
[57:43] all right because our as far in your
[57:49] Redemption you want to go back to where
[57:51] you start up in God's mind are you
[57:56] listening is that as far as you want to
[58:00] go because you're going to redeem
[58:03] yourself out of existence and don't know
[58:05] it
[58:10] are you listening what do you mean I
[58:15] mean one time if we going to a point
[58:20] that in God's mind at one level in his
[58:22] thinking he thought of everybody
[58:25] that would be saved and wouldn't be
[58:27] saved you say well then he could redeem
[58:30] me cause I wanted to be saved
[58:31] just remember it's got to go back
[58:34] further because you're going to redeem
[58:39] yourself out of existence that don't
[58:44] mean nothing to you but I cry God give
[58:49] me some word I know I'm not understood I
[58:53] know the human part but you see we've
[59:01] got to get back fathers and just think
[59:02] about in God's mind we were there for
[59:04] that I want to go back to be part of his
[59:08] mind
[59:11] you realize I was trying to enter a
[59:13] minute ago you realize all them sinners
[59:15] and all the people we give an eternal
[59:17] life it's because of you you realize
[59:22] they would not get eternal life
[59:23] had you not come the way you come let's
[59:30] explain it to them if you hadn't to come
[59:36] the way you come that Center out there
[59:41] wouldn't have no type change of eternal
[59:43] life but because you've come the way you
[59:51] come there's a lot of people going to be
[59:55] in heaven and that's why I love brother
[1:00:00] branham's the message he said them
[1:00:02] either in them countries that never
[1:00:11] heard the gospel he said there'll be
[1:00:14] giving each other life why
[1:00:22] now the cauldron he said because of the
[1:00:24] way they live according to their laws
[1:00:30] what a wonderful shaker
[1:00:34] it would say people that know nothing
[1:00:36] about he but run said he healed those
[1:00:40] Jews every day and they reject him
[1:00:44] instead he heals them in Dutch farm
[1:00:47] every day you don't ever listen to the
[1:00:50] message like that to think of my what a
[1:00:54] wonderful Savior we have but then just
[1:01:00] don't cut yourself obviously said to get
[1:01:02] to thinking of the mind and say well
[1:01:03] that's it far as we can go back to the
[1:01:05] mind that he thought of their sin he's
[1:01:07] out of that he thought of us he thought
[1:01:08] of that you're cutting yourself short
[1:01:18] because you're not listening to the
[1:01:21] interpretation result whom he did or no
[1:01:40] then he did foreknow
[1:01:49] or gain is the definition of the word or
[1:01:55] to know are know before to have
[1:02:04] knowledge beforehand to for know to
[1:02:10] predestinate know which comes first
[1:02:16] you stop your for knowledge at just the
[1:02:19] mind part that you're thinking that
[1:02:21] everybody is there in thinking of that
[1:02:23] for knowledge he foreknew this he
[1:02:25] foreknew that and they just put us all
[1:02:27] in our together you don't have God's
[1:02:30] plan and purpose
[1:02:32] like I said healing of the sick remember
[1:02:39] what was raining out Sunday I told you
[1:02:43] what brother Brian said on that message
[1:02:44] of listening healing of the state he
[1:02:46] said it's talking about the resurrection
[1:02:53] no divine healing no resurrection you
[1:02:58] know what that means divine healing is a
[1:03:01] lot earnest of a lot glorified body
[1:03:06] that's your prophets word divine healing
[1:03:10] is an earnest of a glorified body if he
[1:03:14] can heal this body he can change it it's
[1:03:17] not going to be hard to be done we think
[1:03:19] it is we put it to where we can't get to
[1:03:21] it we say it's something that we can't
[1:03:23] attain unto and just remember eternal
[1:03:33] goes just as far as that away as it goes
[1:03:37] that away and it don't go around and
[1:03:41] meet somewhere okay it's from east to
[1:03:45] west instead of north to south north and
[1:03:47] south would meet the east and west is
[1:03:49] what it can never do because you just go
[1:03:51] around the east you just gonna keep on
[1:03:52] going ain't no you know here so far they
[1:03:56] turn out to be West
[1:04:00] listen church this is what I'm trying to
[1:04:06] preach God had a plan and a purpose that
[1:04:14] he was going to reveal himself to his
[1:04:16] offspring not reveal himself to the
[1:04:20] world
[1:04:21] that's not his plan and purpose if
[1:04:25] you're locked in on that I think about
[1:04:26] you to stop a little bit and think it's
[1:04:30] not just the world being saved is his
[1:04:35] attribute remember now listen remember
[1:04:41] his attribute is eternal as he is
[1:04:47] because it is him what about right
[1:04:54] around to say in this statement that God
[1:05:04] is not complete without you that's the
[1:05:07] statement he's not complete without you
[1:05:12] I don't understand you what are you
[1:05:15] saying
[1:05:15] you mean salvation is not for the world
[1:05:18] no it's not for the world it's far them
[1:05:23] because God allows it to come into
[1:05:27] manifestation because of the way he
[1:05:30] designed it and made it because in that
[1:05:32] way somebody being good to you can
[1:05:34] receive eternal life
[1:05:35] somebody going over and doing this
[1:05:37] without of the other are some he turn
[1:05:39] living according to the laws of his own
[1:05:41] country can be given eternal life but
[1:05:45] he's not in God's foreknowledge and plan
[1:05:47] he's in God's foreknowledge of what he
[1:05:49] will do but he's not in his plan he's
[1:05:56] predestinated to a destiny but he's not
[1:06:00] in a part of God's foreknowledge are you
[1:06:05] listening to Scripture those he did for
[1:06:09] no
[1:06:11] I thought the Bible said that we were
[1:06:19] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:06:22] the world so it's not whether I chose
[1:06:28] they're not and kind of do it
[1:06:29] it's whether he was chosen all right now
[1:06:33] then him being chosen I ain't got no
[1:06:35] problem all I got to do is just relax
[1:06:37] and what he's giving you give him the he
[1:06:41] brought me to my inheritance what is my
[1:06:43] inheritance eternal life all right
[1:06:49] remember that one right brain out the
[1:06:51] other day God never that Jesus never
[1:06:54] gave you an inheritance he only come to
[1:06:58] pay the price to bring you back to it
[1:06:59] what was the inheritance eternal life
[1:07:05] before the foundation or can you go that
[1:07:13] way he chose us in him before the
[1:07:20] foundation of the world when he was
[1:07:24] chosen with children who you know how
[1:07:26] quick he was chosen must have been very
[1:07:30] short because he jumps from the fact of
[1:07:33] being self-existing to right straight
[1:07:35] over into the word and he begins to
[1:07:37] create and ask the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:07:41] Jesus of last Oh Lord Jesus Christ what
[1:07:45] about it what do you get now divide that
[1:07:48] mind up then and think about that in
[1:07:54] God's mind you were not just something
[1:07:57] he taught us that you're a part of his
[1:08:03] mind why why would you even consider
[1:08:07] being a thought are being the point of
[1:08:09] it being because he has given you
[1:08:11] eternal life he is the only one who has
[1:08:16] eternal life and he's given his bride he
[1:08:20] turn alive that's why your Old Testament
[1:08:25] Saints
[1:08:25] they're not counted in eternal life ways
[1:08:28] bring it out wonderful they're not in
[1:08:30] the promise and we have better thing for
[1:08:34] them that day without us could not be
[1:08:35] made perfect they're coming to their
[1:08:37] promise because we come to ours what is
[1:08:40] it going to happen this message has to
[1:08:42] go from here to Israel where the random
[1:08:48] was so close he said I believe I'll go
[1:08:51] but then he was told he was on the way
[1:08:53] to go right the Lord told him to the
[1:08:56] knick with you then rides not fool yet
[1:08:58] go back home what are you saying I'm
[1:09:08] saying if you have eternal life
[1:09:19] message search we would see Jesus 1964
[1:09:22] if you ever was in God's thinking you'll
[1:09:28] always be there if you got eternal life
[1:09:35] you are the expression or the attribute
[1:09:39] of his stop by this age
[1:09:52] what about a church
[1:09:56] you
[1:10:00] lean not to your own understanding you
[1:10:03] see if you were in the foreknowledge of
[1:10:05] God then you are becoming a part of God
[1:10:10] and the only way you can be a son of God
[1:10:14] or a daughter of God you had to be a
[1:10:16] part of God and God isn't complete
[1:10:21] without you
[1:10:34] I've heard but now I see God the Great
[1:10:39] God if you got eternal life then the
[1:10:42] germ of life was in God at the beginning
[1:10:44] and you were there you were in his
[1:10:49] thinking your name and all and he by
[1:10:54] foreknowledge ordained you to see this
[1:11:01] but if you're not ordained you'll never
[1:11:04] see it so then it's farther than just
[1:11:10] going back to the thought of
[1:11:12] predestination because everybody comes
[1:11:18] by predestination it's better than going
[1:11:21] back to say foreknowledge because
[1:11:24] everybody comes by foreknowledge
[1:11:29] but there is a group of people who if
[1:11:32] you have eternal life tonight that's why
[1:11:34] the Prophet would say it the most
[1:11:36] important thing in your life is the
[1:11:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost because you've
[1:11:45] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean
[1:11:49] got it here we you know in your soul
[1:11:51] then that eternal life always was God
[1:11:54] before the world he's the one still
[1:11:57] thinking he's still thinking through you
[1:12:00] he's transmitting his thoughts through
[1:12:02] you may I say it
[1:12:05] why did sister Hattie ride - what
[1:12:08] brother Branham said did brother Branham
[1:12:14] that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:12:17] she picked up a thought from God right
[1:12:20] and she expressed that thought
[1:12:22] concerning what the man had spoken and
[1:12:25] she got the salvation of her two sons so
[1:12:32] if you want to stop with predestination
[1:12:33] and for knowledge as to just thinking
[1:12:36] about being in God's mind hold on to
[1:12:39] that don't lose it which
[1:12:43] see for many years my thoughts has been
[1:12:45] going back further than that who want to
[1:12:50] go back into his mind
[1:12:51] and you just think about that profit
[1:12:55] that's why I emphasize it so much that
[1:12:57] profit went back into God's mind and
[1:12:59] brought out of God's mind the revelation
[1:13:03] for this day that's why I asked you if
[1:13:05] you would you say what do I need to do
[1:13:08] start tape number one after the seals is
[1:13:12] preached and just play them one after
[1:13:14] the other one it'll take you two or
[1:13:18] three years but you know what within
[1:13:23] that you might find what will change
[1:13:27] because I thought we believe rapture in
[1:13:30] faith late in the message of the hour I
[1:13:33] didn't know that it laid in no man I
[1:13:37] thought it laid in there and the fact of
[1:13:41] being the Word of God brought to mankind
[1:13:44] by servant of God that could go all the
[1:13:53] way back in the mind of God so I can
[1:13:56] tell us about Ash old and how to go
[1:13:58] beyond the curtain of time and come out
[1:14:00] and say that I in July himself I was
[1:14:02] looking at him yesterday that angel
[1:14:05] referred twice and said this is sold
[1:14:06] under the altar 4dc beyond the curtain
[1:14:12] of time souls of mankind
[1:14:13] what was he he was in theophany because
[1:14:16] he wasn't in human flesh it was laying
[1:14:18] on the bed he said yeah but now my
[1:14:24] brother Dale I can't go we okay that's
[1:14:26] fine I can't go with you about you you
[1:14:28] think and shoulders you theophany well I
[1:14:29] didn't say it brother Branham did okay
[1:14:31] that's that's up to you now I didn't say
[1:14:34] it he did huh
[1:14:35] would you say that I think your
[1:14:38] shoulders over yonder do you have and
[1:14:44] I'll quote the scripture about eternal
[1:14:46] life
[1:14:46] do you have eternal life at dark and
[1:14:48] eternal life in here there's the secret
[1:14:51] that man never knew even Paul and them
[1:14:55] could not get it into the foolish
[1:14:57] understand
[1:14:57] of how that when that new word comes
[1:15:00] into an individual it steps him back
[1:15:03] just as it would have been had there
[1:15:06] been no fall now quote right around him
[1:15:09] spoken words original seed he said he
[1:15:12] would go right back to where he was in
[1:15:14] the beginning they listened his words he
[1:15:16] knew to heard it know it he said I just
[1:15:19] caught that with him back right where he
[1:15:25] should have been no problem with a
[1:15:29] change in the body that's what we're
[1:15:32] trying to get it I've never worried
[1:15:36] about a change of the body I'm preaching
[1:15:40] to the spirits of mankind because if
[1:15:46] your soul is eternal and I don't have
[1:15:47] anything do that then the only thing is
[1:15:50] keeping you and me from a change of the
[1:15:52] body is this spirit that's within us the
[1:15:55] reason of memory and the conscious
[1:15:57] tonight I thought he said the greatest
[1:15:59] battle ever fought I didn't know
[1:16:01] Christians didn't have that I thought we
[1:16:03] were the basic ones he was preaching up
[1:16:05] that had that right the battle to a
[1:16:09] center in a battle one more time
[1:16:13] we'll go God in his mind could see
[1:16:20] everybody and predestinate everything to
[1:16:23] be by his foreknowledge but then in the
[1:16:29] back part of his mind he had a plan and
[1:16:33] a purpose now listen he didn't have a
[1:16:36] plan and a purpose to just save people
[1:16:43] I'm going to come on down to the word he
[1:16:47] said he had a desire to be father he
[1:16:50] created Adam and Eve that made him
[1:16:52] father a desire to be worshipped he
[1:16:56] created angels and they worshiped you
[1:17:03] know that really your father
[1:17:08] the gospel now your father is not the
[1:17:15] Jehovah the Old Testament your father is
[1:17:26] the son of man according to your prophet
[1:17:32] your father according to the prophet in
[1:17:35] the New Testament dispensation is the
[1:17:38] Son of Man that's what he says
[1:17:41] you won't that quote be glad to give it
[1:17:43] you're to know it he said that was the
[1:17:46] only way he could be the father he
[1:17:48] wanted to be was to be the son of man
[1:17:52] come on show her wake up he said son of
[1:17:58] man I thought we believed the four
[1:18:01] Gospels
[1:18:01] I thought we read them I thought in the
[1:18:04] four Gospels that you find the son of
[1:18:06] man sowing the seed of the kingdom was
[1:18:14] he so deceived and then he gave his life
[1:18:17] to where it would release the life that
[1:18:19] could come back and water the seed to
[1:18:21] make it alive my father is the son of
[1:18:24] man but the Son of Man is not William
[1:18:28] Branham I preset in 1968 he is not the
[1:18:33] Son of Man he is a son of man but I
[1:18:36] can't help it your prophet said that the
[1:18:39] bride would in the life state would be
[1:18:41] the son of man the Word made flesh
[1:18:45] now that's his words well I don't
[1:18:49] understand that does that mean he's
[1:18:50] wrong does that mean he's wrong and
[1:18:56] you're right
[1:18:57] come on musician the simple little point
[1:19:02] let's go back further in God's mind than
[1:19:05] to just a predestination or Presbyterian
[1:19:09] Baptist doctrine you know what the
[1:19:11] Presbyterian and all of it is very far
[1:19:14] cause he's one who told me I'm standing
[1:19:16] right here and I step off I'm glad I got
[1:19:19] that done
[1:19:20] I don't have to do that no more that's
[1:19:23] done that's Presbyterian predestination
[1:19:27] you know the Baptist Church was totally
[1:19:30] split by two brothers over
[1:19:32] predestination they were preaching
[1:19:36] predestination all the way I like the
[1:19:40] way brother instead he said Iranians
[1:19:43] said when that life seed comes in he
[1:19:46] said the Lord of come in city by
[1:19:48] predestination she said what are you
[1:19:52] talking about then is there something
[1:19:53] else
[1:19:54] stepping back into the mind of the one
[1:20:00] that is doing the thinking you realize
[1:20:05] what that makes the children of God that
[1:20:08] makes the children of God God's
[1:20:10] offspring that makes the children of God
[1:20:13] God made manifest in another form called
[1:20:16] a bride predestination the Prophet said
[1:20:23] it's not too bad of a word after all he
[1:20:28] said if you see it by foreknowledge I
[1:20:33] won't say it one more time and let you
[1:20:35] think all didn't say by for knowledge he
[1:20:42] said those who he for know those that
[1:20:52] were not just known of him but were a
[1:20:55] part of him that's the eternal life I'm
[1:20:59] preaching that's the children of God I'm
[1:21:01] preaching that's that new birth in your
[1:21:03] soul right now it's not just to say I'm
[1:21:07] a child of God you're a part of God made
[1:21:10] manifest called a son

[1:21:21] about going right I'll go ahead and say

[1:29:08] Tyson of time but what I mean is going
[1:29:11] to heal me just believe it what did
[1:29:17] Sister Sister Regina's sister Sunday

[1:29:25] I don't remember all everybody how she
[1:29:27] was praying about she was had a lot of
[1:29:29] different things wrong with her body and
[1:29:31] she was praying about it and I spoke
[1:29:33] something on the tape or either to her
[1:29:35] or something and it was just to a point
[1:29:38] and she said I accept that as my healing
[1:29:42] she told me Sunday she said it's totally
[1:29:46] everything I asked him it's gone we'll
[1:29:52] get her to tell the story I believe it I
[1:29:53] believe in healing I believe in the God
[1:29:56] that can do anything he can heal we have
[1:29:59] neither very long okay just coming let's
[1:30:03] see
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:31] the heathen
[1:30:33] and he loves children

[1:30:38] he loves children
[1:30:43] he loves to heal even the sentries what
[1:30:47] about his children
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:31:03] Oh
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:19] I go to dr. Watson's sickness is
[1:31:21] bothering it I believe it's all gone
[1:31:24] that's the way I believe it I believe
[1:31:26] it's all wrong we've seen him come from
[1:31:29] if you seen this man I stayed probably
[1:31:34] three weeks lived in Hall County
[1:31:36] Hospital
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:39] never came home was been take a bath and
[1:31:42] something happened
[1:31:44] stayed with a man in intensive care he
[1:31:49] walked out of that
[1:31:53] you may have some problems with walking
[1:31:55] but he's walking thank God
[1:31:59] I believe the same
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:04] most of you don't even know this story
[1:32:06] because I don't I went to the doctor the
[1:32:12] other day and had a lump in the wrong
[1:32:17] place I believe it's going to be go away
[1:32:22] I went on with the doctor and I said do
[1:32:24] what you want
[1:32:25] what's gone so they put me through what
[1:32:30] AM Emma Grapher went aground where what
[1:32:32] a goner some kind of a thing it's on the
[1:32:35] ground and they called me and they said
[1:32:38] don't you worry about a thing said
[1:32:40] there's no infection and he said there's
[1:32:42] no or she did said there's no malignancy
[1:32:45] heard nothing don't you worry about a
[1:32:47] thing I said I'm very weak I agree
[1:32:52] don't worry about it fine they called
[1:32:55] worries frustration and energy when they
[1:32:59] come in and tell you you got this out of
[1:33:00] the other just look at them and say well
[1:33:02] okay where do we go from here you'd be
[1:33:07] surprised the doctors would even go
[1:33:09] crazy about things but yeah but we've
[1:33:13] seen God do so many things
[1:33:17] why don't we believe in this being real
[1:33:23] Lord Jesus we thank you for tonight and
[1:33:26] we ask you to just help us to understand
[1:33:29] we've tried to express and explain what
[1:33:33] we believe we just want to make sure
[1:33:36] people don't understand us about what
[1:33:38] we're talking about because we truly
[1:33:40] believe in your mind and foreknowledge
[1:33:41] and predestination but we believe that
[1:33:44] we can go back further into your mind to
[1:33:46] see and that we are very part of that
[1:33:48] mind that is made manifest upon this
[1:33:50] earth called the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:33:54] we love you and we thank you take care
[1:33:56] of everybody on the way home and just
[1:33:58] let your letter be with each one of us
[1:34:00] in Jesus name you dismiss
