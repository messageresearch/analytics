[1:59] gonna battle every day so they can fight
[2:01] us here now it's time happening what is
[2:09] an angel
[2:14] I thought let's quote some I realized
[2:16] porks on Interscope and almond kilogram
[2:25] I said what is the angel and messenger

[2:32] [Music]
[2:34] some of them have an angel someone else
[2:37] earthly messenger that God willing to
[2:40] bring his earthly message and these are
[2:43] angels these are missing your angel of
[2:46] the Lord messengers to you and they're
[2:51] standing there with their hands up to
[2:53] obey what God says they hand on a sink
[2:56] in they shot your cover it has to happen
[3:00] the greatest battle ever fought for them
[3:04] I said now here the Bible comes right
[3:06] back and tells us here that God sends
[3:09] four angels glory what are they
[3:12] ministering spirits God ministering
[3:14] spirits sent where from the presence of
[3:18] God what to do to minister his world
[3:21] amen
[3:22] you not to minister some cannot theology
[3:26] is some denomination group but to
[3:28] minister of his word this is ministering
[3:31] spirits sent forth how do we know they
[3:36] are in Bible said that the word of the
[3:38] Lord came to that prophets is that right
[3:40] these angel ministers
[3:48] that servant Joe see that plan how God
[3:54] wants to redeem us when we left Eden it
[3:57] was a beautiful pair there in the garden
[4:00] I mean that lovely little sweetheart in
[4:03] the husband and then by failing God just
[4:06] bringing us right back again through the
[4:08] redemption to redeem us right back to a
[4:11] reason again we're not taking taking us
[4:14] back to the Angels so we're going back
[4:17] and you oughta go in this restaurant and
[4:21] hear that all squeaky juice boxes or
[4:24] everywhere we call it squeaking Bright
[4:27] Angel waits for me nonsense if you the
[4:31] love wife has borne us somebody she
[4:34] waits for you there the human being
[4:36] immortal God made angel but he made us
[4:39] man he made us humans
[4:42] he ain't redeem us back to angels he was
[4:47] he's redeeming back to where we was in
[4:50] the first place human being an evening
[4:52] thinking you see when God Himself was
[4:56] made flesh and dwelt among us he became
[4:59] think folks to the human race that's
[5:01] right the only way it could be what God
[5:04] was made placed
[5:05] marijuana's became temples not to Angel
[5:09] but the human being he never came in the
[5:12] form of an angel but he merely
[5:15] humiliating himself and stripped himself
[5:19] from all his heavenly floors and come
[5:22] down to came for the man in order to
[5:26] fulfill
[5:27] the kinsman redeemer
[5:38] I got some more but I just wanna take
[5:39] birth we went to the mother Joseph stuff
[5:45] Green Knight kept meeting and we Rita
[5:49] had a good time and we felt like to say
[5:52] to her in the atmosphere we didn't want
[5:54] to come down to us and we're so brother

[6:15] not saying it's not a little brother
[6:17] already like that song says this world
[6:21] is not my home
[6:22] I'm just passing through pressure
[6:24] elevated energy somewhere beyond the
[6:29] door I can't feel it
[6:38] [Applause]
[6:47] Moses Commission without a leader or
[6:52] helpless and Christ our leader is our
[6:54] leader and dr. it was mostly durable to
[6:58] send an angel to lead him us and my
[7:01] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[7:03] way to bring me to the place which I had
[7:06] promised the angel was to be a leader
[7:09] the angel kept on it the miracles
[7:13] most of never perform any miracles angel
[7:16] of God and Moses performed a miracle you
[7:19] see what I mean the angel of the Lord
[7:22] was with him angel let them perform the
[7:26] miracle God as always as always by one
[7:32] man through the scripture through all
[7:33] the edges are as ordained angels to
[7:36] guide the people there was most of there
[7:38] was Daniel and how many more we clip to
[7:41] say I found it for - well Graham says
[7:48] that when Moses was born in Egypt what
[7:54] he said to thinking he was gonna take
[7:56] over you know and with his wife
[7:58] supporter that donkey he said there
[8:01] might hit that I don't think it's a
[8:03] scripted when you say there must have
[8:05] been intent the other angels with him
[8:07] water and
[8:16] the Ministry of Christ God has 10 many
[8:21] angels all of us that 14 angels the
[8:23] children of allergies are saying take
[8:25] heed that you despise not these little
[8:27] ones for the angel oldest behold my
[8:30] father's faced which is in heaven that's
[8:32] true
[8:33] be careful what you do against Christian
[8:36] say it would it better to be drown in
[8:39] the sea where they walk around your neck
[8:40] that between even and the pastor to them
[8:43] to one of them be careful the
[8:48] restoration of desperately God Oh a
[8:50] sense is is warning just before the
[8:53] coming of Jesus did send an angel down
[8:56] out of heaven by the name of April no
[8:59] minor angel comes by yet you see angels
[9:03] everyone has a guardian angel according
[9:06] to the scriptures Jesus a they're angels
[9:09] always behold my father's face which is
[9:11] in heaven
[9:12] well there sports false angels true just
[9:16] like this false spirits and so important
[9:19] to angel of God would always point you
[9:21] to Jesus yes sir
[9:23] Paul said if an angel from heaven will
[9:26] come preaching any other gospel than
[9:28] that which you've already heard let him
[9:31] be accursed that right so watch what the
[9:34] angel teaches if it is bringing it long
[9:37] and bringing it long and the gospel
[9:39] stunning doctrine and everything
[9:41] according turn to the Bible and believe
[9:44] it
[9:44] so God always send in jelly beans
[9:49] we need that they are on jellybeans and
[9:51] her to be in our warned the warning the
[9:54] world of judgment to come he said I
[9:57] could go a little bit on the line of
[10:00] sausage we all have guardian angels like
[10:10] 20-30 years ago I had this lady hit me
[10:14] head-on in the only place that was it
[10:17] wasn't all brick I think everything was
[10:19] breakfast where I was sitting
[10:21] so and I was telling my boss that he
[10:24] said it was up in a letter between the
[10:27] letters or something and there was his
[10:29] wife that and having somebody to hold
[10:31] the letter never get up on the letter
[10:32] basically of all before me and he said I
[10:37] can't do this I can't believe this and
[10:40] start reaching way up there and they
[10:41] later start going down nothing to stop
[10:43] hey we say so on god with the red cold
[10:46] one and you stop the letter and
[10:49] even I look for the guy he could never
[10:52] find out and nobody stopped nobody was
[10:54] it even people in denomination you know
[10:58] that there
[11:05] see the first one angels they were
[11:07] saying that a celebration was in heaven
[11:10] but the first time they ever spent on
[11:12] earth was to Shepherds at the birth of
[11:15] God Emmanuel another the first human
[11:18] beings ever heard an angel sing was
[11:21] humble shepherds and we know that every
[11:24] time that the crucified Christ is
[11:27] accepted there's a new birth there's a
[11:29] new horn sheep there is singing them in
[11:32] heaven by the angel over one sinner that
[11:35] repents the angels sing again
[11:48] positioning Christ but being that he was
[11:52] God then there must be something to
[11:55] worship him because he loved worship and
[11:57] his own being create really Christian to
[12:01] worship Him no temporary let's hit it
[12:04] and came temporary now we won't go
[12:07] through the whole thing but you get it
[12:10] on tape but then because that he was
[12:13] thought they made angel and angels
[12:16] worship them angels still worshipped him
[12:19] while the angel dust and that president
[12:21] got have six wings they clearly too on
[12:25] their face 200 feet and fly the two and
[12:29] his presence crying day and night holy
[12:31] holy holy Lord God Almighty that's what
[12:34] the scripture says they worship Him now
[12:37] that really something to worship Him
[12:44] brother Graham said there's no such
[12:46] thing as lemon angels on the bottom and
[12:49] they are shorter than ever
[12:51] I guess the words it's true business
[12:53] take this one yes flammable of God's
[13:00] work our promise is hoped between God
[13:03] and Christ and we're between them with
[13:07] the angel he said he will give his
[13:09] angels charge over thee in the desert or
[13:13] a camping and camp it about those who
[13:16] fear Him and all up and down when we're
[13:20] making this foundation climate you stay
[13:23] higher and higher your state brings me
[13:25] one round hotter and hotter as I move up
[13:28] anything happens if I fall along the
[13:32] road or something happens to me there's
[13:35] a great husband angel standing there to
[13:37] pick me up
[13:38] come on emotional marching on to sign
[13:45] and they are on the road something is
[13:47] done testing and trying your trial child
[13:50] trend as you go along remember is then -
[13:53] it will vary angels to comfort you
[13:56] angels to give you faith angels
[13:58] community alone does that a host angel
[14:01] all up and down the ladder and the angel
[14:04] that God ordered us to miniature
[14:07] ministering spirits blessing to us and
[14:10] to help us along the road and encourage
[14:12] us and we see the deal of science
[14:15] on-site sorry one property
[14:29] I'll have to go and drive around what
[14:31] all this sign that some of them churches
[14:35] it once said make prayer your steering
[14:41] wheel not your spare tire because prayer
[14:44] does work if I had this guide will work
[14:46] at the same time your brother for it
[14:48] and I pray for him he said that yes I'm
[14:51] hurt anymore
[14:52] I don't know pastor you know it's not
[14:56] moving on what and you said keep-keep
[15:01] Franklin companion another one said life
[15:06] is like a grain of sand but eternal life
[15:09] is like the sea shore another said our
[15:14] life a lifeguard can walk on water I saw
[15:19] in this church ok
[15:24] now we know we are saved by grace God
[15:30] has on a little string tied up and the
[15:34] weight said all the spirit is a
[15:36] gentleman he's waiting on him so we do
[15:38] commit a sync with brother Brennan said
[15:40] who senator date way so when we sin got
[15:45] cuts a little string off okay when you
[15:48] repent that gets a little string and
[15:51] ties it up it was that dude ain't you to
[15:54] harder and harder and harder all about
[16:11] Megan where's your stamina
[16:16] which one yeah that won't hurt her even
[16:18] query query do me okay
[16:24] make prayer to sting a Widow's match a
[16:26] spare tire on this joy in trouble
[16:42] questions and answer see Satan was an
[16:45] original Archangel of God he wants trill
[16:48] in heaven he was once the greatest
[16:50] person in heaven and heaven outside God
[16:54] he was God right-hand man to fellowship
[16:56] and he got up you'll get
[17:00] up
[17:11] I gotta talk about the other guy too so
[17:13] I want to hit on
[17:17] and sin did not start on earth since
[17:21] started in heaven Lucifer devil was a
[17:23] condemned creature for the disobedience
[17:26] before he ever struck the earth sin
[17:29] began in heaven for God but the angels
[17:32] and so forth upon the same basis that he
[17:34] put human beings
[17:36] Knology the Tree of Knowledge atrial
[17:39] I've and the Tree of Knowledge were
[17:41] meant to take his choice and when
[17:44] Lucifer was given that preeminence to
[17:46] make his choices he wanted something
[17:49] bigger than God this started the whole
[17:52] trouble the piece of cake now each one
[17:57] of these churches according to the
[17:59] scripture there had an angel and the
[18:01] angel was aminos but it angel meanings
[18:06] the messenger and there was seven seven
[18:09] angels to the seven churches I don't
[18:12] know whether that
[18:15] there's a lot engine I mean that mic
[18:18] important is full of angels but in that
[18:20] technical in Campania things dangerous
[18:27] to the seven churches meaning seven
[18:29] messengers now and there were stars and
[18:33] his hand and his hands he's said a star
[18:37] that was to reflect the light of his
[18:39] presence in the day other night that we
[18:42] are living as the stars reflect the Sun
[18:46] to the earth makes it light so we can
[18:47] walk and get around at night I'm the
[18:50] same man that I had here I know about a
[18:54] revelation that they were angels to the
[18:56] church that the ministry they these did
[19:00] at the beginning and they minister
[19:02] cannot change it mistake had to cause
[19:05] all the way through so now instead of an
[19:08] angel they're keeping them away from
[19:11] this tree is up they're driving them
[19:13] around to this tree an angel that at
[19:16] churches is to every person bring them
[19:18] back to the name of our Lord Jesus
[19:21] Christ who the Tree of Life that stands
[19:23] in the paradise
[19:36] that's good Genesis
[19:48] [Applause]
[19:53] let's go to Genesis 3 1 through 4
[20:02] and we're going to change a little bit
[20:03] enough of that important now the serpent
[20:07] was more subtil than any of the beasts
[20:09] that I feel it's an order ok chapter 3
[20:13] verse 1 now the circle in which the Lord
[20:19] had made and he said to the women yeah
[20:24] and God said you shall not eat of every
[20:27] tree of the garden so notice that God
[20:32] said he made the beasts he made it so if
[20:38] he made it even better many times I want
[20:41] to it and then woman said unto the
[20:45] serpent we may eat other trees of the
[20:49] court but in that truth the tree which
[20:52] is in the midst of the garden God has
[20:54] said you shall not eat of it neither
[20:57] shall you touch it lest you die and the
[21:01] serpent said unto the woman ye shall not
[21:03] surely die
[21:05] so what are the what is the devil's
[21:09] weapon to make us this believe the word
[21:12] or change it to fit him
[21:18] Scofield goes in to a little bit he said
[21:20] even as a type of the church as a bride
[21:23] of Christ the serpent and his intended
[21:27] for me is not to be thought of a reptile
[21:30] that is an effect of the curse the
[21:34] creature who lent itself to Satan may
[21:37] hell what my whole been the most
[21:39] beautiful as it was the most subtle a
[21:42] creature less than men traces that
[21:46] beauty remained as private accursed
[21:48] every movement of a serpent is graceful
[21:51] and many species of beautiful color and
[21:54] the serpent Satan of us first appeared
[21:57] as an angel light everybody things that
[22:03] saved them they will admit God with horn
[22:06] if they said he was
[22:10] and everybody's waiting on those tattoos
[22:13] I saw this guy get off the pickup he has
[22:15] shorts on that but we don't worry about
[22:23] the people he's already got them now
[22:26] he's trying to get us so we have to
[22:29] learn the tactics of the enemy which way
[22:32] is it coming you know that they won't
[22:35] been using anybody has to use somebody
[22:39] to let me read what they were there's
[22:43] nothing in demonology brother and says
[22:50] now the first thing what is the demon
[22:53] you may hear so many people talking
[22:55] about a demon with my demon devil all
[22:58] comes one world one word in the English
[23:01] language is called tormentor so does the
[23:06] same use people to torment us probably
[23:12] so we gotta learn detective that enemy
[23:15] you know so we can name if he comes and
[23:18] tries to get you with something but
[23:20] sorry I'm the karate guy becomes you
[23:23] going to be really too brought it with
[23:24] whatever is thrown at you like this red
[23:29] a fellow that torments is a devil and
[23:34] evil one they say now the bottom of
[23:36] today's is to most to many people is
[23:42] somehow that looked and grandpa and
[23:45] grandma read or something like that
[23:47] there's not so much not much to this
[23:50] with all folks and so forth but that's
[23:53] wrong it's for everybody in dmoz or
[23:57] tormenters that torment us now there's
[24:00] demon that comes into the soul of a man
[24:03] and that is psychology that would be it
[24:06] would be in I say there's though the
[24:09] demon that comes into the soul is
[24:12] something that torments the soul many
[24:15] times you can see a bevy of insanity
[24:19] there may be yet a converted person
[24:22] filled with the Holy Spirit and yet be
[24:25] totally insane see that's right
[24:27] that has nothing to do with a soul is
[24:30] safe torment or see something that
[24:32] torments them now all sickness we have
[24:36] to find out first of all that all
[24:38] sickness comes from the devil it's not
[24:41] the after a sickness no sickness comes
[24:44] from sixes No
[24:49] God sometimes permits safe to put
[24:52] sickness on YouTube with you and bring
[24:56] you back to the house of God when users
[24:58] disobey Him
[24:59] but sickness in the beginning come from
[25:03] devil could you imagine that person
[25:05] would leave that God our Heavenly Father
[25:07] would be an author of such a thing as
[25:10] sickness and dead but no he is never was
[25:14] never will be God promised death because
[25:17] of disobedience God promised death as
[25:19] one writer said on that to do God
[25:24] harness it to bug me pulls it into the
[25:27] presence of God and believer but the
[25:29] work that means separation Jesus said
[25:33] neither hear my words and believe it or
[25:36] me the semi and everlasting life he said
[25:39] I'm the resurrection might be hid they
[25:42] believe in me through he was dead he
[25:45] showed he live and whosoever liveth and
[25:48] believeth in me shall never die
[25:50] and we pack the bodies of each other or
[25:53] the Saints are a great place shall never
[25:56] die
[26:16] now taking the subject demon Allah is
[26:19] speaking about demons
[26:20] now people when you say demon right away
[26:23] they begin to think or some and that
[26:26] fantastic or something demon is just as
[26:28] real as angels and the devil is just as
[26:32] real a real devil as Jesus Christ is the
[26:35] son of God these are they will heaven is
[26:39] just as real and if there is no such
[26:42] thing as hell there is no such thing as
[26:44] heaven and there is an eternal bliss
[26:46] eternal 20 pence there is no eternal
[26:49] bliss if there is no day there's no
[26:52] night but it sure is there they there's
[26:55] night give it as soon as sure that
[26:59] there's a Christian there's got to be a
[27:01] hypocrite as sure there's somebody
[27:04] that's genuine from God there's somebody
[27:07] to be impersonate that see it's just a
[27:10] sickly throw and come back and white I
[27:13] don't not to the life on everything true
[27:16] they're false everywhere and there's a
[27:18] false gospel there's a two in custody
[27:20] there's the true baptism there's a false
[27:23] baptism as the main believe and there's
[27:26] a real there's two American dollars
[27:28] there's a false American dollar there's
[27:31] a genuine Christian there's a genuine
[27:33] hypocrisy that's just imports
[27:35] impersonating so you find that it all
[27:40] goes together now we can separate it
[27:42] because the rainfall
[28:07] that's it I was just gonna mention
[28:11] something regarding diving angels you
[28:13] don't mind I was gonna mention something
[28:14] regarding the angels of your mind no I
[28:18] figured stuff it's just interesting uh
[28:24] you know because you know the Bible says
[28:26] that the angels are ministering spirits
[28:28] right and it calls brother Brenton many
[28:31] times called ministers angels you know
[28:34] prophets were pastors you know angels
[28:37] and that's what the Bible says regarding
[28:39] the the meaning of the word of the word
[28:42] angel decisions and Strong's Concordance
[28:46] in the New Testament in the Greek is the
[28:49] word I had loosed which means to bring
[28:51] the tidings of messenger especially an
[28:54] angel by application of Pastner I need a
[28:57] messenger envoy one who has sent an
[28:59] angel messenger from God so you notice
[29:02] that a man an angel sent from God
[29:04] usually when when they're asked you know
[29:08] they always say I come from the presence
[29:10] of the Lord
[29:11] they're very humble they're usually meek
[29:13] and they get gift they give God the
[29:15] glory
[29:16] they give God the credit right so that's
[29:18] why you know a true angel of God or a
[29:22] messenger or a pastor or a minister
[29:24] that's what they should be doing is
[29:26] giving God the glory
[29:27] showing that humility so I just wanted
[29:31] to drive it out but also I thought it
[29:33] was interesting that the city of Los
[29:35] Angeles that's the Spanish word of which
[29:39] means the city of the angels
[29:41] but originally that city now now it's
[29:46] very interesting because you know Sodom
[29:48] and Gomorrah had angels go to the to the
[29:51] city and of course the city was
[29:53] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was
[29:56] destroyed but they no but originally
[29:58] that city was supposed to be called was
[30:01] supposed to be called up says the name
[30:04] Los Angeles comes from the Spanish
[30:05] language and it means that angels the
[30:08] name is an abbreviation from the
[30:09] original name of the place the original
[30:11] name is el pueblo de nuestra senora la
[30:13] reina de los ángeles a real force in
[30:15] Portland which means which means the
[30:20] town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of
[30:24] the river pour simcha low so it was
[30:27] originally I was supposed to be called
[30:29] originally the queen of the angels but
[30:32] then they they they renamed Los Angeles
[30:34] so that's good I know her that and of
[30:36] course you know the Los Angeles ISTE is
[30:39] the capital of Hollywood and you know
[30:42] movies the music industry is huge there
[30:46] so which was the same thing was in Sodom
[30:50] and Gomorrah right it's just bill yeah
[30:54] bill theory would fallen angels and I
[30:57] just the kind of thought that was just
[30:59] to throw that in there
[31:02] are you making tea let's go to number 12
[31:15] 12 start mister started wanted to end
[31:28] and Marian and Eric spec against mostly
[31:31] because of the Egyptian woman whom he
[31:33] had married before he had married and
[31:34] his chip Ethiopian moment and they said
[31:37] had the Lord in his home or by Moses
[31:40] head Venus pokeman also by us and they
[31:46] were herded down and Moses was very meek
[31:49] above all the man that which were upon
[31:51] the face of the earth and the law
[31:53] respect suddenly unto Moses and after
[31:56] Aaron and to Miriam come on you three
[31:58] into the tabernacle of the congregation
[32:00] and they three came out and the Lord
[32:04] came down in the pillar of cloud and
[32:06] stood in the door of the tabernacle and
[32:08] called Aaron and Aaron and they both
[32:11] came forth and he said here not my words
[32:14] if there be a prophet among you I the
[32:17] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[32:20] a vision and I will speak unto Him in a
[32:23] dream
[32:23] my servant Moses is not soul who is
[32:28] faithful in all my house with him I
[32:30] would speak mouth to mouth even
[32:33] apparently and not in door speeches and
[32:36] assimilate the Lord shall be behold
[32:40] where for them
[32:41] where are you not afraid to speak
[32:44] against my servant Moses and the angel
[32:47] of the Lord was killed kindled against
[32:49] them and they parted and the power
[32:52] departed from out that cabinet and the
[32:55] whole mirror became leprous white as
[32:58] snow and there
[32:59] upon Miriam and behold she was leprous
[33:04] so God doesn't brings six another said
[33:07] before they marry I need a little
[33:10] whipping you don't mess with my you
[33:14] don't mess with my profit is it so
[33:24] Ephesians 6:12 6:12 chapter 6 12 through
[33:33] 17
[33:40] chapter six verse 12 for we wrestle not
[33:43] against flesh and blood but against
[33:45] principalities against powers against
[33:48] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[33:50] against spiritual wickedness in high
[33:52] places
[33:53] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[33:56] of God that you may be able to stand and
[33:59] evil day and having done all to stand
[34:03] therefore having your loins Girt about
[34:07] the truth and having on that press PLAY
[34:09] muchness and your feet shod with the
[34:12] preparation of the gospel of peace above
[34:14] all taking the shield of faith wherever
[34:17] you shall be able to quench all the
[34:19] fiery darts but awake it and take the
[34:22] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[34:24] Spirit so you have to know what you know
[34:28] what's coming at you did you three to be
[34:31] ready
[34:42] and the CEO governors of Silla safe is
[34:44] to reject the gospel or change it is
[34:48] only about the same people
[34:49] yes and Paul said I am a prison of the
[34:52] Lord
[34:53] either your prisoner of Christ or you're
[34:55] a prisoner of the devil so let's say
[34:59] it's two sizes on your two side so you
[35:01] choose between which one
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:10] save me a few places and save is 814 but
[35:25] I said now then let us look mouth to
[35:28] this great for great for a few minutes
[35:31] distance great simple day that we are
[35:33] not living in I don't believe there's
[35:36] ever was a day that I had read in
[35:38] history there's been later days that
[35:40] persecution when the children I God was
[35:43] put to death on every hand but to see
[35:47] the seaplanes
[35:48] of the enemy we never had a day like
[35:50] this
[35:51] we were not living in it's the most
[35:53] cunning the cease full day and when I
[35:56] see that it brings this that the
[35:59] Christian has to be more on his toes
[36:01] today than ever with any age now but I
[36:06] can today's a prosecution of wrong to
[36:09] take the church a Christian made a
[36:10] mistake he went into the arena was
[36:13] picked to the Lions or something like
[36:14] that then they found him not being a
[36:20] Christian for his testimony but he stole
[36:23] was saved because he was that Puri an
[36:25] adulterer believer and God and gladly
[36:29] share his testimony with his verb and
[36:32] the things that loose or holes in his
[36:35] body and the blood bled it out he would
[36:37] scream up the real world famous a
[36:42] receive my spirit or Jesus but now the
[36:47] countenance that the devil now makes the
[36:49] people believe that they are Christians
[36:51] when they are not there is the thing you
[36:55] don't have to seal is more cunning than
[36:58] you
[36:58] would be that when you had to see your
[37:02] life away we're testimony that they've
[37:05] always said every cunning trap that he
[37:07] can - it's the deceiver and Jesus told
[37:11] us the magic 24 how this day would be
[37:14] that we're living in the most deceitful
[37:16] day never live suppose that he would
[37:20] deceive the very elect God evil possible

[38:18] cuts her hair like this like his and he
[38:21] tries to wear his like her see she wears
[38:24] his outside coat and he wears her inside

[39:49] them and they shall be his people and
[39:51] God himself shall be with them and be

[39:57] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[39:59] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[40:02] so there be any more pain for the former
[40:07] things are passed away and he that said
[40:11] upon the throne said behold I make all
[40:13] things new and he said unto me write for
[40:16] this horse of two and faithful and he
[40:19] said unto me it is done Alpha and Omega
[40:22] the beginning in the end I will give
