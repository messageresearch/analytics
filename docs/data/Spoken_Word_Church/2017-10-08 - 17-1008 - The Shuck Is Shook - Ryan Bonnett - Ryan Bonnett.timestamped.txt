[0:12] yeah yeah no thank you
[0:16] all right yeah we can see it from here
[0:18] by that you might think that you've only
[0:20] got the Richard setup only for you
[0:24] laughs a dental video and audio only for
[0:35] did you ask did you ask Johnny
[1:06] you're looking at me oh alright let's
[1:11] break he became a father we thank you
[1:14] for its get together today for another
[1:15] Sunday School lesson services today the
[1:18] previous lesson is done
[1:25] - growing especially
[1:30] the gorge yourself
[1:38] especially
[1:52] so the idea for this lesson came from a
[1:56] lot of recent events I want to try to
[1:58] talk slower and louder I'm not naturally
[2:01] that way okay so you could help me raise
[2:04] your hands you can't hear me okay please
[2:06] I really am not good at that
[2:09] but especially from the recent
[2:12] fellowship meeting on the late nights
[2:14] and comments about this stuff being
[2:16] shook the show Chuck and all those
[2:18] things and I've written a letter to
[2:20] brother down about what I had noticed
[2:22] not only on that service but especially
[2:24] in that service more than I've ever
[2:26] noticed it before about basically two
[2:29] groups of people that I've seen in the
[2:31] midst of regular is basically the those
[2:35] seeking an indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[2:37] and those seeking an anointing that's
[2:38] right
[2:39] and I'm not going to say it's wrong to
[2:40] secret anointing I think we ought to but
[2:42] really that won't hold you during the
[2:45] time that I was given and it won't
[2:48] really you turn the hand please
[2:52] away from you are all just whichever
[2:55] it's our top people go to a hug people
[2:58] maybe down back thank you June July by
[3:05] that you know I'm not saying anybody's
[3:07] wrong in saying that you know he
[3:11] continued on so I want to go through
[3:37] some folks I'm just going to kind of
[3:38] speed through these these are ones y'all
[3:40] are probably very familiar with and then
[3:44] get to my actual lesson modern events
[3:47] make clear about policy the inside you
[3:50] have a spirit when we leave in the
[3:51] yellow there and there you have five
[3:53] outlets your conscience and love and so
[3:56] forth
[3:56] five outlets to that spirit remember in
[3:59] that spirit you can be baptized with the
[4:02] genuine Spirit of God and still be lost
[4:05] it's the soul that lives it was her name
[4:08] of God you know so
[4:18] now what happened to me that was so
[4:20] profound in that service that brother
[4:23] way of priests here that Saturday that
[4:25] fellowship meeting was starting probably
[4:28] three weeks or so a student brother Dale
[4:31] started announcing that he was coming I
[4:32] started praying for brother William and
[4:35] I made a habit of doing that over the
[4:37] years not just fellowship meetings not
[4:39] just special ministers but all of our
[4:40] fivefold ministry when I know I am going
[4:42] to preach how I start praying for him
[4:44] and and that's just part of this one
[4:47] little testimony so I had already been
[4:50] in a prayerful attitude about it
[4:51] the day of I think it was that from the
[4:55] way in preached me and Gabby were doing
[4:56] our daily Bible reading and we came
[4:58] across Matthew 13 and we read that that
[5:02] day before brother William preached and
[5:05] then I came across that one word
[5:09] understanding a couple times it's
[5:11] mentioned there in Matthew 13 and I've
[5:13] tapped on an electic art about to look
[5:15] at the Strong's Concordance a bit seems
[5:17] to help me understand exactly what that
[5:19] word means in that context so I just
[5:22] prayed about it and they're not even out
[5:23] loud
[5:24] Gavin and you know it's right now I
[5:25] think I just think over them myself I'm
[5:27] fault in our reading and I just looked
[5:28] at that my said Lord just tell me how
[5:30] much I love that mate and Lord of the
[5:33] whole bar the waiter preached his title
[5:35] was he that understanding sort of like a
[5:40] God incidents and the whole entire
[5:42] tournament he was preaching about the
[5:44] difference between understanding versus
[5:46] knowledge you know having a hidden
[5:47] knowledge versus
[5:48] understand he said it's a revelation
[5:50] that's what understanding it so in my
[5:54] mind looking sitting back to there this
[5:57] little big man that I am nobody sitting
[6:00] back there on the corner
[6:01] I would think if God would look down
[6:03] congregation he'd say all these people
[6:05] that are so sincere and seeking of
[6:07] anointing and putting themselves out
[6:09] there and really you know energetic and
[6:11] everything and praising God doing the
[6:13] song service and gobble it down and
[6:15] bless them but they became and instead
[6:17] kind of bypassed over family came down
[6:19] there's still nobody in that corner to
[6:22] your question
[6:23] that's how profound got to work look
[6:26] over all these other things where you
[6:27] think the blessing should belong and go
[6:30] to some little nobody an entire state
[6:31] open to the answer but at the same time
[6:35] I noticed like I said in that service so
[6:37] profound the two distinguishable groups
[6:40] after anointing secrets in the dwelling
[6:42] state is there and in a row brother
[6:45] Delta Lincoln letter about that and then
[6:48] brought later in the comments about the
[6:49] shuttle sure it's the best watch shows
[6:51] that Tyler hunt that will help you kind
[6:53] of remember what we're talking about and
[6:55] maybe make it stick to you and I'm not
[6:57] just talking about the people that came
[6:58] here for the dust man okay there are
[7:00] people into this group in our church and
[7:02] in every Church over there in the North
[7:04] thing here they want to see a preacher
[7:05] get up there and sweat and thereon and
[7:08] shower and then little William Bulevar
[7:10] gets up there little bitty guy because
[7:12] there don't even break a sweat
[7:13] not a girl almost wet didn't shout and
[7:15] yet the most profound and Arlington
[7:18] discerning what was on my mind on my
[7:20] heart and carried out an answer that's
[7:22] romantic
[7:23] I mean I thought this running the island
[7:25] not doing damn thing wrong with that
[7:26] that's right
[7:27] but to master their graded marketing
[7:29] when Johnson stood up there
[7:30] indiscernible is in my mind right
[7:31] William not knowing it masterpiece Oh
[7:43] God let's back up a little bit
[7:46] she was in view receive the same time
[7:49] she was for review the first time the
[7:52] bride then she was reviewed the second
[7:54] time and she was perfectly the second
[7:56] time like she was the first time Oh God
[7:58] have mercy hurry hurry hurry
[8:00] laughs get in the drain right quick they
[8:02] talked about coming out of the shove the
[8:04] Pentecostal owner to show the carrier it
[8:06] was necessary that they'll Pentecostal
[8:08] it should happen that's work she revels
[8:10] message was sent but then people sat in
[8:12] it when they didn't move out of
[8:13] industrial that's at this day many
[8:15] people are sitting in that
[8:18] the only ones at the end time the left
[8:22] keeps advancing on but remember it's in
[8:25] another state it can't remain in that
[8:27] stage we can eat the a carrion of some
[8:30] other age we can't be Pentecostal Carey
[8:33] and Methodists or Baptists Terry we have
[8:36] fresh fruit the work of this hour what
[8:48] was each messenger what was Martin
[8:50] Luther a rebuke to the Catholic what was
[8:52] Wesley a rebuke to them Lutheran what
[8:55] was the Pentecost Arab youth to their
[8:56] mothers where has the left are now away
[8:59] from an organization no more shop it's
[9:01] the grain what is it a rebuke to the
[9:04] Pentecost imminency to fulfill the
[9:07] scripture of this our images place can
[9:21] receive it neither can a man receive it
[9:23] and stay in his denomination who have to
[9:25] follow the wheat or go with the show
[9:28] either one
[9:29] he wants the about there is a decision
[9:32] to be made that's right each of us has
[9:35] to decide where we want to go one of the
[9:37] hawkmen
[9:38] wanna sit with the feel-good group or
[9:41] move on over to the group where the
[9:43] worst thing for everything and we're
[9:45] talking about right which feels pretty
[9:46] good too sure
[9:48] when God looks over a whole crowd of
[9:50] people not that nobody got anything I
[9:51] know a lot of people got something on
[9:53] that service but if you respect that
[9:56] also make them look more expecting
[9:58] something myself and God I felt good
[10:00] there's no house and like they're crying
[10:10] this I know this problem of them all
[10:12] himself
[10:12] sure is thinking about money yet so this
[10:16] shows free moral agency are they sure
[10:19] okay not then push the reply
[10:22] we'll get to that later on I think I'm
[10:24] not that quote for Charlotte's maybe
[10:25] with the election is not God pushing us
[10:31] to the path it's based on this poor
[10:32] knowledge of our choice I have her
[10:39] McNasty
[10:40] said the corner late fall into the
[10:42] ground had to dive through those dark
[10:43] ages like any other corner weight has to
[10:45] go beneath earth and be buried to break
[10:48] forth in the first Reformation then two
[10:50] blades of Luther to stop it had to grown
[10:52] forth in the Westland up Joyner to bring
[10:54] forth the pollen the tassels the great
[10:56] missionary had to come forth in the
[10:58] Pentecostal for the restoration he has
[11:00] promised to deceive the very elect it
[11:02] looks like a wheat grain open it up
[11:04] there's no weight there at all it's only
[11:06] shot
[11:10] right
[11:13] this is a continuation of that quote
[11:16] mounts begin to pull away the weeks
[11:19] begin to be sim this is not a
[11:21] pentecostal edges as the latter decades
[11:23] since the bride age this is the evening
[11:25] life this is when Malachi 4 must be
[11:28] fulfilled to follow God's pattern this
[11:31] is Luke 1730 to be fulfilled this is the
[11:33] second and Jeremiah and all the rest are
[11:35] the Joel spoke oh these days this is
[11:39] that day I've heard Lord and it was
[11:42] coming but now I say bleep
[11:52] I've already covered all this
[11:56] and then there's also okay I'm pointing
[11:59] this lesson towards those that are in
[12:00] the stuff and those who are seeking I'm
[12:01] wanting but also at the same time I'm
[12:04] gearing this toward those who are still
[12:05] asleep
[12:06] spiritually okay very much I see a
[12:09] program today that even our congregation
[12:11] they're people even reading the Bible
[12:14] every day going to church every service
[12:16] from seeking God's and said early and
[12:18] yet you can still a miss about be asleep
[12:20] just like the freeze just like the
[12:23] Pharisees were 2,000 years ago the
[12:25] missus in Christ though they were very
[12:26] sincere and very adamant astronomical
[12:29] images so the rapture out of their
[12:36] combat perceiving age that Pentecostal
[12:38] age that's more of wait anybody ever
[12:41] hear ever raise any weight you look at
[12:43] that weight when you look at it when you
[12:45] go out there say I've got weight you
[12:48] look like you got weight there but open
[12:50] it up real close and watch you haven't
[12:52] got no weight at all you got a show did
[12:55] jesus warned us of that matthew 24 in
[12:58] the last days that the two spirits would
[12:59] be so close together would receive the
[13:01] elected wheat itself if it was possible
[13:04] as he watches a carrier
[13:10] the Seventh Seal this is sort of
[13:14] interesting how this truck mail was
[13:15] yesterday morning preparedness
[13:17] PowerPoint and at the same time I was
[13:20] kind of going through my notes and
[13:22] listening to the seals and reading
[13:23] ourselves a long seven so message I was
[13:26] asking God you know to find the quote
[13:28] pertaining to this lesson what we're
[13:31] fixing to get into and I came to right
[13:33] across it right there in the middle of
[13:35] my study and prepared for this message
[13:37] this lesson you're still not until the
[13:41] next revival when your one cell with the
[13:44] Holy Ghost it's the finished work that
[13:46] God has received you that's right and
[13:48] there's no getting away from okay you
[13:50] musters God must receive your sacrifice
[13:52] right you come to bring the Dasara
[13:54] yourself to be awed you commit yourself
[13:56] to God and you keep moving on through
[13:57] sanctification brother Aaron is the
[13:59] first one I'm never here it's about not
[14:01] stopping and sanctification in fact in
[14:03] 2002 I think of three it reached that I
[14:06] was this period of sanctification for
[14:08] the first time so but I've never really
[14:11] stopped going through that process of
[14:13] sanctification but just don't ever stop
[14:15] that I'll never stop seeking because
[14:17] you're tempted to think when you reach
[14:19] sanctification that you're already not
[14:21] you know that you already go with the
[14:23] Holy Spirit the way I'm about to catch
[14:24] up so after you approach him give
[14:27] yourself to him consecrate yourself for
[14:29] me to him he baptizes you with the Holy
[14:32] Ghost and you're absolutely know when
[14:34] this takes place
[14:40] I
[14:44] and this is one thing we've heard quite
[14:47] a bit here Dean him and if you just take
[14:49] your own mind of thinking reason they
[14:51] like Eve did at the beginning they can
[14:53] explain everything of the bottle away
[14:55] from here but if a man let me stop there
[14:59] for a second if you're in the anointing
[15:01] part of it if you're just looking for
[15:03] anything electing really you can you can
[15:05] have anything work really explain the
[15:08] way from you look I think to this move
[15:10] from church to church wherever you find
[15:11] out what you just tossed about to and I
[15:13] throw that every wind of doctrine but if
[15:15] a man a woman ever has been on the
[15:17] backside of the desert and those sacred
[15:19] sands where no intellectual can stand
[15:22] and there come in contact with the
[15:24] Living God
[15:25] no devil no scientist or anything else
[15:27] can ever explain that away you were
[15:29] there it happened you know it's the
[15:31] truth there's no one can take it away
[15:33] from me you meant God and I believe that
[15:35] God every age singing for the messenger
[15:38] always first meets that person on a
[15:39] sacred ground because it's got to be so
[15:49] oh so I mean I have read the book the
[16:00] prince of the house of David alright so
[16:07] we bought it come on Segoe and we
[16:10] started reading it meaning that we do
[16:11] and what I find in that book is the same
[16:16] thing that's happening today John the
[16:17] Baptist family if you're not familiar
[16:19] with the base for this girl
[16:20] Dinah I think it's how you say her name
[16:22] this Jewish girl she goes back to
[16:26] homeland they should go back to
[16:27] Jerusalem happens to be there at the
[16:29] time of John the Baptist was coming on
[16:31] the scene and this is sort of a fiction
[16:33] story but there's a lot of parts that
[16:35] you know that you could prove maybe by
[16:38] the Bible or at least speculate and
[16:40] there's a lot of characters in the Bible
[16:42] that are introduced and coming to the
[16:44] story and what they're all doing is this
[16:47] girl and her visitor uncle rabbi
[16:50] something grabbed by famous and then
[16:53] many other people that she encounters
[16:55] are trying to attack in the scripture
[16:58] and see if this man John the Baptist
[17:00] could really be fulfilling you know
[17:02] Malachi when did melt a 3-run could
[17:05] really be fulfilling that and they're
[17:06] just checking every little bit of his
[17:08] life and then Jesus comes on the scene
[17:10] and they start to check his life with
[17:12] the scripture so what they're doing is
[17:14] the people who saw Elijah of that day
[17:16] and saw Jesus and that day were the ones
[17:20] who were the most studying and praying
[17:21] and seeking God and fern every bit of
[17:24] their lives to see if they match the
[17:25] stretcher whereas say the Pharisees
[17:28] would maybe study look into it say no he
[17:30] could be
[17:31] he was born in Bethlehem with and they
[17:33] said actually is born he was born in
[17:34] Bethlehem and then and so on so forth
[17:36] basically they're checking they're
[17:38] trying they're they're searching the
[17:40] scriptures as he said and then you think
[17:42] you have eternal life from there they're
[17:43] testifying me and aren't they Elijah
[17:45] came in and and Jesus is coming again
[17:47] all the same Christ and the headstone
[17:50] and people are missing them even if
[17:52] they're reading and praying missing them
[17:54] because of tradition and ideas and all
[17:56] those things so what I like about that
[17:58] book is you really pay close attention
[18:00] and just watch how people some groups
[18:02] miss them and some groups see them a lot
[18:04] of most sincere on the other side but
[18:07] you know there's just basically those
[18:08] who are willing to hear and those who
[18:10] are really seeking the time to farm the
[18:12] truth other ones that prime it okay so
[18:14] read that book we bought a couple of
[18:17] them that we want to give out to anybody
[18:19] who doesn't have one just basically we
[18:21] got three here found order and horror if
[18:24] you want one and if you'll read it okay
[18:26] I just said I'm here for help those are
[18:28] for anybody and then if you want some
[18:31] more let me know it'll be glad it worked
[18:32] together and was on these seven dollars
[18:35] pretty cheap okay I'll be glad to order
[18:37] ten more if any by the reader to know
[18:40] but I'm at on that adamant about it
[18:42] because I say something in that this
[18:44] happening again today I just really want
[18:46] you all to see exactly what's happening
[18:47] that's the aisle okay for me the banner
[18:50] makes reference to a law it would be
[18:51] good if you picked it up and read it
[18:54] it's really good the prince of the house
[18:55] of David all I showed of that just so I
[18:57] could say your prophets arias I've heard
[19:04] that quote for years here is important
[19:06] finally bought it also your master said
[19:11] also fictitional bunion trick pilgrims
[19:17] progress your pastor actually said
[19:19] probably a year ago I guess he said
[19:21] something he said I think you should
[19:22] read that book and I'd already listened
[19:26] to the audiobook that you get a lot out
[19:27] of it I finally bought on Amazon and man
[19:30] there's a lot of Nuggets and Avenue will
[19:32] just sit and have just long
[19:33] conversations about these little
[19:35] allegories these little stories and type
[19:38] scene and this sort of this stuff this
[19:41] things there's different principles that
[19:42] you face in the Christian life that's
[19:53] that now start the lesson objective to
[19:58] see that if you do what God requires
[20:00] won't you be accepted this goes back to
[20:03] Cain and Abel thanks to clean you know
[20:05] that in the story of Cain and Abel both
[20:07] of them sincere any difference was Abel
[20:11] had a revelation of what God will fire
[20:13] does provide a place to worship and so
[20:14] forth Abel it was blood was a part but
[20:17] Cain said God take it or leave it
[20:20] that could we fall in that category
[20:21] about reading and praying and studying
[20:23] and come to church and listening to
[20:26] sermons and stillness in Christ sure
[20:29] because the contests are importantly
[20:30] just stop they just don't make me please
[20:32] sincere enough or maybe don't have it
[20:35] here to hear just not really looking not
[20:37] really expecting and this isn't really
[20:43] sounding arrogant but later on if I have
[20:45] time I want to get into something about
[20:46] mine and Gabby's story and I know a lot
[20:48] of people nuns make on the area and your
[20:50] exalted or what have you but I don't
[20:53] know what to talk to you about except
[20:54] from my story about how the
[20:56] and said tell them how you're fired I
[20:59] see these minutes I see them coming up
[21:02] and I see how they did it is making
[21:05] themselves available to God and really
[21:07] being sincere and and then I started
[21:10] doing the same thing and have the same
[21:12] result so if you there's that won't you
[21:13] be accepted originator so as long as you
[21:23] fusses from the Godhead explain when you
[21:25] brother
[21:25] bill asked us to listen to as long as
[21:28] you first you're both wrong
[21:30] see because this is about brother
[21:32] sitting brother Ness okay don't take
[21:35] sides with every one of you brethren as
[21:36] long as you fuss you're both wrong see
[21:38] because I would rather be wrong and my
[21:40] doctrine and rot in my heart than to be
[21:42] arrived in my doctrine and wrong in my
[21:44] heart see after all is your heart
[21:46] condition
[21:52] God is in his work was when we're real
[21:56] familiar with that the right mental
[21:58] attitude for any divine promise of God
[22:00] way of the past the right mental
[22:02] attitude but you've got to have the
[22:04] right attitude the attitude it's what
[22:06] brings the results
[22:16] they approach to God what I did on it
[22:19] through that sermon and just picked up
[22:21] several different quotes and I made
[22:23] reference to and there if you want to
[22:24] look them up but just basically things
[22:27] that is part of our approach to God
[22:30] through the shedding of blood brings the
[22:33] approach to God making a burnt sacrifice
[22:35] for each one to have a way of approach
[22:37] to God God seen the honesty and
[22:40] sincerity and before you can ever become
[22:44] a partaker of this blessed heavenly
[22:46] calling you have to come through the
[22:47] provided approach not self-sustaining
[22:49] not intellectually but death to yourself
[22:51] and are reborn again in Christ Jesus
[22:54] through the offering of the blood you'll
[22:57] never see it and you can't approach it
[22:59] until you die out to those things and
[23:01] come God's provided way of approach
[23:03] given which is Jesus Christ being filled
[23:05] with the Holy Spirit God provide a way
[23:07] for Senator Tom so this is approach to
[23:09] not shedding our blood the honesty and
[23:10] sincerity to the death to yourself and
[23:13] reborn again across Jesus to the
[23:14] offering the blood and Gotha provider
[23:16] approach which is Jesus Christ being
[23:18] filled with the Holy Ghost home scary
[23:20] these are some of the things this is me
[23:23] on brother ground that things are some
[23:24] of the things that I think of when you
[23:27] talk about attitude and approach to God
[23:28] faith worth not just not just believing
[23:32] because the devil believes but I mean
[23:33] faith is a revelation and sincerity
[23:35] desperation hunger and thirst for
[23:38] righteousness yes
[23:39] those righteousness shall be filled so
[23:41] be really desperate that's for the
[23:44] parish ear to hear have a emphasis on
[23:48] fivefold ministry about how much loud
[23:51] just about that
[23:53] hey what Oh excellent that doesn't want
[24:00] with some fridge magnets you know Riley
[24:01] everybody doing some more fridge magnets
[24:04] no but I used it this effort and it's
[24:07] really good
[24:07] okay put them on your fridge contract
[24:12] part willingness to take correction okay
[24:15] and over it's when you're wrong no
[24:16] matter how long you go believe in
[24:18] something you see correction and another
[24:26] thing is attitude is not saying why do
[24:29] we need this from the dead let's talk
[24:31] about people of incarnation to say we
[24:33] need this or you know belittling
[24:35] basically what's happening cuz what what
[24:37] is happening here is Jesus Christ is
[24:38] speaking to us on a five fold ministry
[24:40] and you're standing there lightly
[24:42] esteeming him missing donning simplicity
[24:45] because thanks from Pastor that's just
[24:47] brother way that's just for the bar you
[24:49] know and you're missing them across them
[24:51] these brothers you think it's down and
[24:54] in reality it's actually Christ even a
[24:56] bit of a brother and that's where you
[24:58] can miss Christ and simplicity okay
[24:59] prophet is not without honor except in
[25:01] his own
[25:02] so don't just sit in a message search in
[25:07] this thing I believe you're not elected
[25:10] data make sure that configure one this
[25:12] is a mainly following the statute
[25:15] placing ham and your faith virtue and
[25:17] virtue moment and down the first date
[25:19] for if these things be in you and abound
[25:20] they make you that you'll neither be
[25:22] barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of
[25:23] our Lord Jesus Christ but neither lack
[25:26] of these things is blind cannot see afar
[25:29] off and hath forgotten that he was
[25:30] purged from his old sense
[25:32] wherefore the rather brethren give
[25:33] diligence to make their calling and
[25:35] election sure for he knew these things
[25:37] from their fault or so an entrance shall
[25:39] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[25:41] the everlasting kingdom of our own
[25:43] Savior Jesus Christ in us
[25:56] I'm just a second
[26:03] okay
[26:05] right
[26:07] being elected of God does not mean the
[26:10] way I push therapod we have something to
[26:12] do
[26:12] even Jesus stands in the door knocks in
[26:15] the door the driver made herself ready
[26:20] anoint thine eyes with ourselves these
[26:22] are all acts of all these are the things
[26:24] that we do study to show thyself
[26:26] approved and then these are actions
[26:29] taken by us abroad so election is based
[26:34] on God's foreknowledge of what we choose
[26:36] we already going to that Sun and in
[26:40] Matthew 11 brother father talked about
[26:43] this a while back in a Sunday School
[26:44] lesson talked about being violent
[26:45] Christians you know he said and for
[26:47] Matthew 11 jesus said you know of Heaven
[26:49] suffereth violence and the violent take
[26:51] of my portrait all right
[26:53] porch means claim for oneself eagerly it
[26:57] means to be eager think about violence
[27:00] its violence is never something
[27:03] spontaneous or sporadic it's really
[27:06] something that's premeditated right you
[27:08] meditate on something before you do it
[27:10] you know Jesus in the temple when you
[27:12] chased out the money changers tables and
[27:14] all them turn the tables over and all
[27:16] those that were selling he probably
[27:18] looked like a terrorist you know it's a
[27:19] lot of people who are outside watching
[27:20] him he probably thought this phase of
[27:22] terrorists but he was looking like he
[27:23] was being violent when he sat down
[27:25] premeditated that you know that was
[27:27] something he thought out beforehand and
[27:29] when you're seeking God and you're
[27:31] coming to God you do it in such a way
[27:33] that you're eager you're violent and
[27:35] you're meditating on your thinking on
[27:36] these things all the time that's Rory
[27:38] not discouraged you're not deterred
[27:41] nothing involuntary about it it's always
[27:43] something intentional right in your line
[27:49] focus never down the fivefold ministry
[27:51] is given ordained by God and must not be
[27:56] like the esteem Ephesians 4:11 and he
[27:58] gave some apostles some prophets some
[28:00] evangelists some pastors teachers but
[28:02] affecting the Saints for the work of the
[28:03] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[28:05] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[28:07] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[28:09] sun-god
[28:09] to a perfect man to the measure of the
[28:11] stature of the Florence price that we
[28:13] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[28:15] and fro and carried about with every
[28:16] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[28:19] crafts were above the line wait to
[28:21] receive God is simplicity hiding in a
[28:24] group of men people teaching and
[28:27] preaching office on all the big things
[28:30] okay
[28:35] babies for Less continuation of that but
[28:39] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[28:41] into him in all things which is the head
[28:43] even Christ ever in the head stone age
[28:46] this is today from that fork from whom
[28:48] the whole body fitly joined together and
[28:50] compacted by that which every joint
[28:52] supplies according to the effectual
[28:54] working in the measure a very part meant
[28:57] an increase of the body unto the
[28:58] edifying of self and low as I say
[29:01] therefore testify on the Lord that ye
[29:02] henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[29:05] walk in the vanity of their mind have
[29:07] any understanding
[29:08] Darkman this is what by the wings
[29:10] preaching about one or
[29:12] me about being alienated from the life
[29:15] of God through the ignorance that is in
[29:17] them because the box of the heart
[29:20] [Applause]
[29:22] [Music]
[29:24] that was yeah take one down and pass it
[29:29] around
[29:30] is there are two step with on the
[29:32] instructions with some step one put it
[29:36] on your fridge step 2 grab a beverage
[29:38] and until I want you to read it
[29:40] meaning think about it a lot okay yep
[29:44] that well call it boy
[29:52] actually this one a pretty good bit
[29:54] I think I've done this before
[29:56] and Romans 13:11 and that knowing the
[29:58] time that it's now that it is now time
[30:01] to awake out of sleep for now is our
[30:04] salvation nearer than when we believe
[30:05] the night is far spent the day is at
[30:08] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[30:10] of the dark odorous let's turn the
[30:12] honors black okay speaking of the
[30:17] possible ministry this is just a quiz
[30:21] based on brother Bell sermon from
[30:24] September 17th even the service that day
[30:27] I'm not doing this to show you how much
[30:29] I know work or try to make you feel like
[30:31] you don't know anything I'm simply doing
[30:32] this to show you how much you can miss
[30:35] someone a brother Dale sermon because
[30:36] everybody says he's repeating themself
[30:38] me he's breathing too simple and all
[30:40] these things bro to people whichever
[30:42] other but if you just go over this quiz
[30:45] in their own time we won't have time
[30:47] really and just answer these questions
[30:49] and think about this thing but mostly
[30:51] just think about how much you could miss
[30:55] if you are not really paying attention
[30:57] and something me and Gabby both do
[31:01] regular it's go back to listen to the
[31:03] sermons even though we're here for me
[31:04] they go back and listen to I've been
[31:07] over and over and over until I really
[31:09] feel like I've got it you think because
[31:12] you can miss a whole lot of nuggets even
[31:13] when you're sitting here in the
[31:17] and I'm not saying go to the next slide
[31:21] to follow the thoughtful man if it means
[31:24] more than just coming to church and
[31:25] listening which should be listening to
[31:26] sermons of our ministers at home we
[31:29] should also do the homework assignments
[31:30] sort of like the book that has to have
[31:33] the prince of the house of David and
[31:34] that he'll be progress but especially
[31:37] with brother Dale goes way any brother
[31:39] says to read or listen to a certain
[31:41] firmament that is really crucial that
[31:43] you do it because they don't you stay
[31:45] focused on the work that's being brought
[31:46] your intuitive way don't just be with it
[31:49] I mean and you don't remember you get a
[31:51] little piece of paper and a pen go the
[31:52] long way or just on your hand you know
[32:02] I'm not saying you have to do these
[32:04] things to me today but you will want to
[32:06] do them if God tells you something
[32:08] through brother Dale or any of these
[32:10] ministries and you ignore it you're
[32:14] doing the same thing as tank you know
[32:15] your things all this is all I'm gonna do
[32:17] take it or leave it
[32:18] so is your attitude to God and you are
[32:21] really sincere and really desperate will
[32:23] show it to God through your eyes
[32:30] I'll start on this topic don't think
[32:33] we'll get very far but this is an asset
[32:35] that's gonna look like a thin area but
[32:37] man Gaby have established the marriage
[32:40] consecrated the Christ the idea came
[32:42] into my mind for doing that when I was a
[32:44] little 15 year old Baptist kid we had a
[32:46] youth pastor in our youth group on
[32:49] Wednesday nights the whole entire thing
[32:51] of the youth group from Winston oxwas
[32:54] see he first became a dog Matthew 6:33
[32:56] they taught us all these different
[32:58] lessons about seeking God and that's the
[33:00] perfect thing for a kid to hear at that
[33:02] age the most important thing to teach
[33:04] any kid in that age from age 12 to 20
[33:07] they seek God first and so he also said
[33:11] within that time of that lesson they
[33:14] gave us a little diagram of a triangle
[33:16] or pyramid which everyone call it and
[33:19] said this is how when you get married
[33:21] someday this is how you should do it
[33:22] that you should have a marriage where
[33:25] and of course leads to these lines
[33:26] signifying relationships so husband wife
[33:28] of America have a relationship duh then
[33:32] husband has relationships individually
[33:35] with God okay in other words he's
[33:36] seeking God in his own private prayer
[33:38] time and quiet time why black was okay
[33:41] but then collectively
[33:43] they read the Bible together and they
[33:45] pray together they go to church together
[33:47] talk about the Lord together do all
[33:49] these things together and in that the
[33:51] marriage will be blessed just the same
[33:53] as if you're if you do those
[33:54] individually what my father says is
[33:56] secret they were weren't you opening
[33:57] because so if you want your marriage to
[33:59] be blessed and then you do these things
[34:02] just is you doing the vigil and it's not
[34:03] to substitute the individual prayer time
[34:05] you still pray and read and see God
[34:08] individually but
[34:09] into your marriage and watch how God
[34:11] will bless your marriage and sustain
[34:12] I've never seen a marriage based on this
[34:14] actually fell by how same one come
[34:17] unraveled because a three-fold cord is
[34:19] not quickly broken but I've never seen
[34:21] one actually felt if they establish this
[34:23] and then maintain it day in and day out
[34:25] for years and years you read and pray
[34:27] and study together to every day keep
[34:29] seeking God and I there's several
[34:33] examples of this brother and sister Dale
[34:35] don't know don't know how much I meet
[34:37] them on the highway but every time I
[34:39] meet them on the road I'm in the chicken
[34:40] truck somehow they see me sometimes it
[34:41] all nice and they're looking at them
[34:43] brother nails doing this talk because
[34:48] somebody met passengers say they think
[35:00] more they're sitting there talking about
[35:02] you and then I say little bitty hands I
[35:05] haven't asked any of these couples that
[35:06] they do it but Bob and Monica she was
[35:08] reading the youth wrote a book on the
[35:10] way to church the other day just an
[35:12] example okay the little things that you
[35:14] do and the relationship and I'll pick up
[35:16] on the weeks and Christine went visited
[35:17] them in their house for the first time
[35:19] last Saturday and all over the house is
[35:21] from into being a blank message books
[35:23] and the little things that they go from
[35:25] doing Rachel or a prime example
[35:27] I'm not time to set up anybody saying
[35:29] you're not doing this I'm just saying
[35:30] these are examples of
[35:32] and watch their hands be blessed okay
[35:38] get all the way through there you save
[35:41] something please ask these for 1200 km
[35:43] from I got this picked off and the three
[35:45] phone cord of marriage is not quickly
[35:47] broken and I said I've seen it broken
[35:50] but that was because one of those three
[35:52] four threefold cords came unraveled a
[35:55] I've seen America started that way
[35:57] maintain that for a decade at least in
[36:00] the man max live the woman stayed going
[36:03] to church reading about friends at the
[36:05] man started to get back away from God
[36:07] and within about ten years I watched
[36:09] America crumble and they're divorced
[36:10] today so it has to be established and
[36:14] maintained younger sister there in the
[36:23] time that that scam B was actually
[36:24] adopted by her adoptive family this
[36:28] message will even receive her in their
[36:31] homes when she was in that condition
[36:32] this was around town was just trying to
[36:34] kill herself
[36:34] right or a short after but she was
[36:36] trying to commit suicide because she was
[36:39] depressed and I'm just showing you this
[36:42] to show you how how the Lord get ahold
[36:45] of somebody all right and this is Gabby
[36:49] after the or got ahold of her and when
[36:52] she came in to that message blaming home
[36:53] she she took up with the message and
[36:55] began studying a privacy God
[37:00] this is how much I have to say about
[37:01] this but basically just to sum it up I
[37:08] wanted to establish that marriage based
[37:11] on making price in our marriage and year
[37:15] exactly meant this is this is one year
[37:17] after we met
[37:18] this was after we got engaged she wasn't
[37:21] happy because she makes bigger pictures
[37:22] okay when I had it up a bit down in this
[37:24] place this is at a youth camp about this
[37:28] campground in Kentucky
[37:30] George was there joist and hope they
[37:32] carpooled together think up there and me
[37:34] and my thing was talking to us at the
[37:37] very moment when I first saw Gabby and
[37:39] went over to this literal spot and
[37:41] introduced myself to her and asked her
[37:42] to come into the fellowship issue
[37:43] sitting there by herself and she was
[37:46] sitting on a rock between two trees and
[37:48] this established something that's
[37:50] repeated over and over and over in our
[37:52] marriage but keep seeing these symbology
[37:55] zuv Christ and all lives
[37:57] consecrated to Christ okay I did not say
[38:01] this this is not the reason I married
[38:02] her I didn't say well you sent me in
[38:04] sign I should marry this room actually
[38:06] found a sign of indication from His Word
[38:08] and that's what I've had a thought for
[38:10] but years my father years into our
[38:13] marriage this is why we're getting to
[38:14] sleep this and then it repeated let's
[38:19] have one our multiplication that's the
[38:20] same
[38:29] this is one of the many places where
[38:32] this thing repeated when I went up there
[38:33] and after that but there marry her and
[38:36] go and get our wedding bands that they
[38:38] asked her she'd come pick out our
[38:40] wedding bands because I think they're we
[38:41] got she picked out these that we have
[38:44] are now that have the crosses on them
[38:46] and we like to preserve a process and
[38:47] we've never realized till later they'll
[38:49] meet train but ever really pay attention
[38:51] to the symbology there again is that
[38:52] same thing across on either side of
[38:54] these rocks or diamonds okay
[38:57] showing Christ now on either side of
[38:59] these two lives Christian lives
[39:01] concentrating the Christ okay
[39:04] what I'm saying is if you honor God
[39:06] double honor you if you put them in your
[39:08] marriage put them in your parenting and
[39:10] in your job and everything you do you
[39:11] watch Connor those look good and see God
[39:14] and all those things welcome our stay
[39:17] about that I'll just all that so next
[39:18] week
