Gary well Rebecca's on a business trip and brother Gary is riding along you know kind of kind of help her on the business so remember that and said they'd be back in I think this weekend but just remember that all right then if you'd like turn in your scripture turn where we've been reading Romans 8 amen and we'll go to Genesis 3:15 so we pray that the Lord would just continue on our thought and may we you know see him made manifest as the main thing right how does God predestinate yes he predestines by for knowledge amen CU he knew all the things that would take place and you knew what would happen in the garden so that's what we're reading about amen is to seeing what happen in the garden to relate down to where we are now and then we can can see the whole thing right amen father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for Calvary thank you for being you Lord and revealing yourself unto us and thank you for not staying up in heaven when you created man and we fail but yet you come right down here to be with us and just fellowship with us even in our fallen estate you did not cast us away but now Lord we pray that you would just open our eyes to the the revelation of redemption that we may walk in the light of your grace we love you and we thank you be with each one of these that are sick we know the report there sister Monica's mother's not looking good but yet we still believe in a Healer who can take care of all things we love you and we thank you Father guide us now have your way in Jesus name amen okay Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren now remember that Sunday the first born all right moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and them he justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us right let's run over in Genesis now and just read Genesis 3:15 very famili your scripture with us but yet learning a whole lot more about it am says and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thy shall bruise his heel you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been covering for quite a bit on this and trying to get over a little bit tonight we still uh you know put a secondary title to the life two messages plus tonight we'll be talking about part three of the seed of the woman now I want you to think with me about the point that we're trying to bring that I'm not like brother forny now taking off doing I'm just sputter sputter and just clim climber and fall down and get up and walk on okay but see to me now to my understanding and I know it goes spiritual then it goes physical it goes in through every way but see there's only two seeds all right now everybody has to be included within that point of two seeds right okay now two seeds meaning what the seed of the serpent yep and the seed of the woman yep right all right now so then everything would fall as I said within that category of those two seeds that's right right all right and we know that it started with the point of the serpent trying to inject or did inject into uh Eve his unbelief which perverted the word right because there's really not two words there's only one word the other one is a perverted word so then you've got two seeds it's really not two seeds one right seed one perverted seed are people all right and see the serpent has no seed all right so then there was no way for him to be able to uh do anything so he had to use the Beast all right now but remember then we'll get to it in a minute about that seed of the beast that's why it doesn't call it the seed of the Beast right see if it said the seed of the Beast there would have been no mystery right right man would have been able to read the Bible and said with the seed of the beast but by being the fact of saying it was the most subtle of all the serpent was of the Beast all right then it put a mystery in the Bible am that's right that mystery is that there's only two seeds then right all right it's the seed of God the other is a perverted right seed right something that was done wrong right amen all right so now then even the Beast as I said it wouldn't be called the the seed of the Beast right it would be called the seed of The Serpent and then all the way through the Bible you could speak of the serpent but then remember the last part when you're coming into the Book of Revelations you're going back until it speaks of the Beast that rose up all right that's all right so it's a spiritual Point beginning but then it goes into something more than just a a a a a spiritual point there has to be an attribute like there drinking gambling smoking running around with women is not sin that's the attribute of it so then what happened in the garden physically was an attribute of that and that was the way the prophet said that Satan had of trying to enter the human race right he could not create right all right so then he wouldn't be able to do that but now remember he has no physical seed he is a we we showed the prophet said he is a spirit being he he you know he spiritual being he's he has no natural physical seed and he can't create right God could create but see the serpent couldn't create all he could do was just take the knowledge he had of the principles of life and to see that if he could get even that Beast together that God would have to do something right as I was saying our Sunday see the children of Israel you know they were fine but you know they couldn't be cursed right so bam said well all right just get them women down there with them men they'll take I'll take care of he'll have to do something so that's what happened in the garden but in the garden as we'll get back to it later the prophet said was fulfill the predestinated plan of God Amen all right now he predestinated by for knowledge not by choosing he doesn't choose he predestines by his for knowledge he knew what would happen if he created man all right but he knew what he would do amen oh yes now we've been through that part to try to come up to the to the point of talking tonight that he knew exactly what he was going to do sure he is this didn't pull anything over on him he didn't say uh-oh things have went wrong so I better come up with a secondary plan you know no by his for knowledge he knew exactly what would happen yes he knew all right so then he knew how to be prepared all right now so it would come down to be then that so you you would I'm trying to cover a whole over viw of the entire point and and you know I told you some people actually believe that the uh what happened in the garden was this is literally the way they believe it that uh Adam and Eve just uh were supposed to got together on down the road somewhere but they goofed up and got together too early and it messed up the plan and all of the things and or either they'll make it just a spiritual happening all right a spiritual happening I gave you that I quoted that the other day but I wanted to read it to you where you know that that you could see it and see what it means so go ahead brother Joe and pull or Brother Anderson pull up number one which is the 70th week of Daniel 6186 all right now we read this the other day but I want you to think on that point the seed of the serpent that's the killer many people don't believe that but if you'll just read Genesis the Bible said that the serpent had a seed and I'll put imity between the Serpent's Seed and the woman's seed it ain't mentioning no other seeds it's just the the two point so the serpent had a seed and if the serpent seed was spiritual see as some people believe then Jesus was not a man so the woman's seed would be spiritual see if you saw it was just spiritual in the garden you know that was just spiritual well then you didn't have no reason for Jesus coming right go see that would be if they both had seeds and the enmity is still there the serpent had a seed all right but now think about it you you may not consider why I would bring up a lot of things but see it's in people's minds what was brought down and and you know had been taught and uh I try to take that out by letting the Prophet take it out am if it was a spiritual seed then the prophet said then Jesus would have been spiritual to the woman's seed cuz we know the woman's seed was Christ all right so that should take it out of people's mind of any thoughts that would you know of being there all right but let's think about something we know that the Messiah was the promise seed right all right to come but I want you to think about something with me for a minute I want you to really get a thought go ahead with number two which is taken from page 99 of the Ephesian Church age which is church age book and he's reading Genesis 3:15 and I'll put imity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou sht bruise his heel if you give credit to the word that the woman did have a seed then the serpent must surely had a seed also now watch it you'd say well well brother Dale you you you you try to do things and and then you read of something that you say the serpent don't have a seed and then the prophet says the serpent does have a seed all right now that's up to you to figure out so I'd pray for a revelation all right but then to try to help you with it the I love to cover something like this if the seed of the woman was a Manchild apart from the man now are you reading it if the seed of the woman all right was a man child apart from the man in other words not by man right it wasn't by man right see of the woman was Christ which was by creation come on no man involved all right see then the seed of the serpent will have to be in the same pattern and that is another male must be born apart from human male instrumentality right right all right so Cain was born some way without human instrumentality are you reading it yes sir see Jesus Christ was born without human instrumentality no man was used Eve didn't I Mary didn't Supply the egg no problem it was all creation virgin birth right so if that's true now so would it be true that the seed of the serpent would have to come into being some way a part not of human male instrumentality come right but by the Beast sir which was not a human not a man all right are you with me are you with the prophet see all he says there is no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was the Christ who came by the instrumentality of God Amen apart from Human intercourse it is also just as well known that the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in actuality a prophecy concerning what Christ would do to accomplish what Christ would do at Calvary all right now read that over and over each one of these seeds that we're talking about is going to come without human instrumentality right right all right everybody got that stoked in amen so that would mean God would have to create to bring Jesus Satan can't do it all right so he goes to some other form to try to to bring a seed into being are you with me y but it wouldn't be no human being so it wouldn't be as some people believe that Adam was the tree of life and Eve was the tree of not of death they got together and it brought death that won't work no all right taking out doctrines as we go along but proving something here now amen now if I don't get nothing else tonight I want you to get one thing we spend a lot of time preachers in this message preaching against the women hammering them to death yeah right right and we know what's supposed to be right and told and truth right right and uh we know where the problem was that we know what happened in the garden right we know what's still happening today right the woman is trying to go over the man that's right right because she started out teaching the the serpent which was the Beast standing there and preaching to him y that's right and the brother R said she thought she was right and he said she still thinks she's right right yeah yeah that's right and about 20 years later Cain still had the same idea that Mama had yeah right so she must have been teaching him some more yeah right that's just dropping little things in for you think of but I want you to think about a point now to bring into to being the seed of the Beast which we know it's not called out it's called The Seed of the serpent all right we know it starts with unbelief leads into other things right actuality all right you realize then that through the wound of woman woman L people I say w ear a lot of times and they wonder how you spell it w o m e r n you know Southern okay but through the wound of a woman Came Death right right you agree right right but you know through a wound of a woman came life same wound amen same very wound sir not same person but same wound right came life right so now the thing that we want to holler and scream so much about the women y you know y God uses her y to bring life amen think about it amen the seed of the woman never come by just a physical creation of laying the egg out on a rock or sperm or whatever you know and let it produce he went right back to the wound y to bring it forth amen okay and that's according to the scriptures all right let's prove a point go to number three couple of scriptures just you think of Genesis 3 And1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said un woman you you know all right so now that was the seed of the serpent yeah coming through the Beast to bring into what would be called in the seed of the serpent right not by mankind right the Beast wasn't a man no right look like a man right talk like a man but he wasn't a man then what was he well you argue the point but look at the next one in Luke Luke 135 we find that how the the seed of Christ came amen the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God Amen okay now there is two wounds bringing forth not by male instrumentality of the human race right now you can argue the Beast and what it looked like I know what it we understand the message upright and everything else but he wasn't a man because if it was remember in your creation you're going to have to bring all your animals in on about the fourth or fifth day and Man was created on the sixth all right see so you wouldn't intermingle that to try to bring the Beast and the man right you got to put him in the animal kingdom yes sir amen God proven that you had to put him in the anal Kingdom through the prophet he says what animal was used to cause the fall Animal will have to be the sacrifice he didn't say man would be no right that's right the animal all right now so then we know for a certainty that the seat of the woman was Jesus Christ amen all right that came not by man right okay now then the seed of the serpent would be the degrading of mankind right perverting it degrading it uh Hy breing until it would bring in to being mankind now you can follow a lineage of the Beast and and and we will more as we go along a little because you get over to the sons of God saw the daughters of man and and that sons of God would be the the sons of Seth and the daughters of man is the Sons the daughters of Cain brother R says that so you can follow that down even brings it down and he says that seed of the serpent came down in Judas and the seed of Christ came down you know Jesus Christ the seed of the woman all right but my point has been asking you the question why does it say The Seed of the woman when a woman don't have a seed that's right one is you know the Bible speak of it the prophet uses it why is it saying it like that that's my point to get you to thinking past your your uh Cranium cap of the front of your brain that works to let you think well going on back into the subconscious part of you into your brain and subconscious leading down into the soul and the Soul being the real being whatever beginning you to think seriously why would it be called the seed of the woman on when she doesn't have one all right so now let's jump over Brother Anderson I knew tonight wasn't going to go the way I wanted to anyway but let's jump over to number 18a the ones I gave you they the last and a little message I'd invite you to go listen to it asked Wade the other day I said do you realize the the one this message he loves to preach off of Genesis 16 12 126 and 27 a lot you know and uh I said go see what brother randam used as a scripture for Oneness he started off with Genesis 126 and 27 all right but look what he says now this is paragraph 92 one this notice this now the woman was not a seed see back up behind there he's showing you you know that if it if she had a seed she could reproduce but she can't do it she's only got an egg part all right watch therefore he said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed telling her that he was going himself to give her a seed not through an intercourse sexually he was going to create in her a seed right that's right now well you say would that be his seed right now would that be his seed whose seed would it be yes it would belong to Mary then after he gave it to her amen amen see that would be his seed the seed the the Christ but then when he gives it to Mary it belongs to Mary okay this is my eye he gave me this it's my eye but he gave give it to me this is my hand he gave it to me this is my voice but he gave it to me see and the seed that was merry had nothing to do with Mary it was something God did himself see now there's your virgin birth right all right but yet think about it now we know for assurity what it would be it would be the seed of God but now how is God going to bring it forth right to work and fulfill the Redemptive work the plan how can God bring it forth could he just speak no so he goes back to the point of what giving her the seed right you remember in Genesis we talking about Sunday where Eve said Heath appointed right me a seed instead of Abel which Cain slew and brother R said see there said she didn't say she got more seed no or whatever said if he did that would have been Christ coming right back there right right but it had to wait see it's called The Seed of the woman amen because it belongs to the woman sir now without the woman where would you have Redemption right amen come on I can just hear them old preachers out there on the internet well he ain't nothing but a I can hear one side saying he ain't nothing what they jna call me a m show and his Pig and the other side would call look there he just he he's he's speaks up for the women all time I try to tell the truth amen why don't you tell it on right right Adam was the one that done the worst part cuz Adam knew exactly what he was doing right but we don't want to blame him we want to hold him up cuz he's the the male but see it's her seed God give it to her but without her how could it ever come to pass right well he could just create well why didn't he right why why didn't he just create he did but now why didn't he just create without any virgin birth cuz he couldn't been a redeemer a redeemer would have to be somebody like us right amen all right and I said a moment ago then if the seed of the serpent is spiritual then Jesus would be spiritual and you would have no Redemption and we read there in Romans ever service it's talking about the Sons and Daughters of God all right and you realize then what would have to take place God we know came down and created an egg and a sperm or whatever you want to call it placed it in the wound of Mary and just bored that and brought forth a child and that child would be almighty God Amen in human flesh right all right so then he wouldn't be becoming God at the River Jordan etc etc that's right amen that wouldn't be working out he was born Lord the Christ all right now so then as it picks up in the story it would mean that that one that would come in flesh would have to first be K folks y right right had to be right amen right amen amen see spoken words wouldn't kin folks whatever you think of mchz that body that could eat whatever he ate that that would no kin to us that was a creation spoke in Spoke out just look like us Jesus had to come as to be a man amen that's all right sir the man amen Christ Jesus the Bible call right all right see then that man could pay the price yes he could you remember in Revelation no man was worthy it's got to be a man so it had to be first what kin folks right to make a kinsman redeemer to fulfill Ruth all right second off to be a redeemer to be able to pay the price would require not that he would send a second person person cuz that wouldn't be right he would have to come himself to pay the price yes sir now how is he going to come into being come on he came into being through the wound of a woman right right sir right didn't let out on a rock put in the wound of a woman so whatever you want to think about the women and I'm just plain language as the prophet said there's nothing worse than a garbage can than a bad woman and I mean a garbage can ain't as bad but he said she's also speaking of all that is good amen sir so now it's According to which one you want to use right sure there's a lot of garbage can need to be pried against y but what about the true genuine amen all right and see that that would come from her would have to be specially designed you know to be able to receive what would take place the body according to Hebrews 10:5 a body thou H has prefered me all right so that body we know it's a creation it was the egg the sperm that was placed there the woman was just used as an incubator to bring it forth but remember she did was connected Navy to it and did bring energy through her so she's used we'll get back to her after a while and we'll see what's taking place she was used to energize or what you want to call it through her Naval core was brought life it was not a discon NE from the naval core and just God just plumped a couple of of good pills in there and it produced Christ no no he used the woman all right sisters that put you over on the other side don't it but we just don't go too far on the other side cuz when we do we start with the wrong thing all right but now as it did and as we were reading this the prophet said nobody said everybody knows any Bible scholar or Bible student he said knows that the seat of the woman was Jesus Christ that's right all right so the Redeemer that would pay the price would have to come from the woman amen now am both seeds come through the woman right that's right right come on the seed of the Beast come to the woman y That's right The Seed of God came through the woman both of them was given her come on it was given to Eve to bring forth the Beast child Cain it was given to Mary to bring forth Jesus Christ all right not coming by man right BEC coming by woman right come on it wouldn't have come by man sure we come by the first Adam a first man Adam and the second man you know okay but get the point where'd the baby come now then the prophet says off the message it wasn't so from the beginning number five you can jump backwards with me now we'll pick up e19 and he says Adam was a created son right Adam was his son a creative son when God became flesh and dwelt in the body that he created which was his only begotten son Adam was his son a creative son but Jesus was his begotten son son okay John 1 and4 it says and he was the only begotten of the father right right right full of grace and truth only begotten of the father all right right amen now what would he be called in to tie together to make it all get to to the right place and you'll see what I was hitting that Sunday he's called in this end time a special designation a special um statement about him so go ahead with Revelation 3:14 and as the angel of the Church of the lady of said write these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God you see folks I'll repeat this again if I have time but you know God didn't stop creating in Genesis like we think we think he just created the the world he created he created this created Adam his life's creation where did you get that from if he's the beginning of the creation of God then you've left out your creation of God you've left out your your story yes sir see he's the beginning of the creation of God right which is God in human flesh you say Well when was God created that cell that was created in Mary's W was the beginning of the creation of God amen amen all right go ahead number eight okay some ear in church AG Church AG book see within her wound a cell that would multiply and become the body of Our Lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of God that's who Jesus is it goes on explaining the blood the holy part okay save time go to the next one number nine won't just get a little point across and then we'll drop back on something else and look what he says about him here on the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom paragraph 3:16 the Holy Blood that was created by God the blood the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God amen amen that's right oh you see it God made in creation right that's right now Jesus wasn't the beginning of any I you know the beginning like that God never existed before then and all at once he come into being he's a beginning now you know better than that cuz he's he created the world and and he's been all the way down and and Jesus Christ come 4,000 years later from even the beginning but Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God oh you see it God made in creation he was Spirit the Bible said he's the beginning of the creation of God how did he begin in the wounds of a woman which is what the woman is not like how them blind people can't see the serpent seed right here the Eve was put here on the earth and before Satan ever touched her or anything else God said to them multiply and replenish the Earth right that's right but Satan comes in here and he messed it up but did he he mess it up like we think did he destroy God's plan or did he help him fulfill it as we've covered about that he was to be a redeemer A Healer a savior Etc okay look at the next one let's see that's 357 we read that remember the Holy Ghost descended Upon Jesus which Jesus was a part of the earth why the germ of God the life of God was designed in the wound of a woman that's right which was the Earth all right and then the life of God came in so he was the beginning of the creation of God right now that was a said 4,000 years past physical creation so evidently God didn't stop creating right evidently his physical part was just laying the background or the material or getting things in line to come to the bases that he would really bring his true creation into being right right right because it doesn't speak of Adam as being the beginning of the creation of God no right he was the first in the human race yes right come on S but Jesus Christ is the beginning of the creation of God Amen that's right amen that's when he began to bring into being what he really wanted right amen Adam was only an example right right right so he wasn't through creating right man he was just starting right all right so let's just keep reading look at the next one which is number 11 proving his word 1964 8 16 paragraph 183 he proved the word by saying he was Jehovah made manifest he was the beginning of the creation of God God in creation God was a little part of the creation here that God was living in himself he was the beginning of the creation of God from him begets many sons note he also multiplied the fishes the word because he was the word right all right now think with me then the beginning of the creation of God in a physical extin extinct or doings every how you say that word was when Jesus Christ came into being as the seed of the woman amen through the Virgin birth and brought him in as being the beginning of the creation of God right what about being the last age before you bring that out so it would mean this age is to get a revelation of all of it right a little more to it than just that let's think look the next one why it had to be Shepherds paragraph 98 he started a creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ now then according to that as I said you don't wait for him to become God that's why I've always believed about you know since I come in the message and seeing what the prophet was saying see that body was a creation all right it was not Eternal no his body was not Eternal had to be made Eternal all but you are you reading what he was saying here a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so there's the Flesh and here come at the birth amen come on right was what the Soul and Spirit of almighty God Amen right now you got one God correctly amen and you're not Oneness because you done brought 4,000 years of bringing him to to get him here and it still ain't all finished you know why we don't believe in Oneness around here right Oneness means one like your finger and Oneness come to the point of saying that Jesus was the life manifestation of God now I don't agree with neither one of them right sir I believe one thing for sure the bride is the LI IM morphe of God all right now that's right so he didn't stop creating back there I say he's still creating tonight am listen look at the next one this is the seat of discrepancy 65 118 paragraph 35 but they finally came forth until both of those seeds the seed of discrepancy and the seed of God put forth their genuine heads and that wound up in Judas is carot there's the seed of gpsy right and in Jesus Christ for for he was the seed of God he was the beginning of the creation of God he was nothing less than God and Judas was born the son of predition Came From Hell returned to Hell Jesus Christ was the Son of God the word of God made manifest Judas SC in his discrepancy was the seat of the devil come to the world and for deceit just like he was at the beginning Cain his former father all right nothing less than God what do you believe about God see most of the people now are beginning to believe that like I said that he wouldn't go out to the River Jordan and then he was just a man till it got there and then PL God makes jumps into the man and he stays with him three and a half years and then he BL jumps back out of him and he goes and dies all right that wouldn't be the beginning of the creation of God Amen if he was just a man that would be a man it wouldn't be the beginning of the the creation of God he couldn't fit Revelation 3:14 right right right so I think about it 14 Ladi Us in church age or church book page 336 the beginning of the creation of God that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God now listen to him making him lower than godhead you just spend all this time saying that Jesus was you're same Prophet what's he saying right then this first creation created all the rest of the universe oh but brother Dale the scripture says Jesus Christ created all things amen I'm glad you can read your Bible but you have a revelation right then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the words are he is the beginner or author of the creation of God now we know for assurity that Jesus is God very God he is the creator John 1:3 now what's he saying what is he getting to see there is no doubt that he is the creator he goes to Exodus all the scripture he was the creator of a physical or a finished physical creation yes sir absolutely surely we can see what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God how could God be created when he himself is the creator right now get the point yes sir God himself created an egg and a sperm brought forth one that would be called the beginning of the creation of God that's right that's a physical thing now what was in him was not physical right amen what was in Jesus Christ was not physical it was the creator himself James I think it's 3 and9 or somewhere in there where you go the Jesus Christ created all things all right think about it he was a creator of a finished physical creation that looks like it's all finished doesn't it but then when he come to Revelation 3:14 he says it's the beginning of the creation of God all right getting the thought together then what do we see we see two seeds both coming from the same wound you know not the same physical Point Eve was one Mary was the other one come on we see God using that to bring himself into the human race or into being physically can I state it that way right he came into being physically tangible a man to be a redeemer etc etc right the Beast perverted the rest of the all of the human race is perverted except him that's right that's true that's true am none of this physical creation is worth anything right none of the physical creation is worth anything so we better start trying to figure out how is it that we could maybe become a part of this beginning of the creation of God this new creation this new race that's it right because the physical part is not worth anything brother random on the Hebrew series said I hate to think that I i' only five it's old he said because I born in sin shap in iniquity spouse my mother is wound to Liar see nothing in the physical creation is worth anything true he's not going to re you know remodel something but he has to start a away of doing something all right see we like these things but do we really understand them look at number 15 take them from God in Simplicity 63 317 the morning service paragraph 58 they are the Catholic Church talking about them the organization we're free from that we are the continuation of the doctrine of the Apostles do you believe believe that amen I Believe by way of the end time message and things that the faith of the fathers has been restored to the people don't you amen and we are a continuation of the doctrine of the Apostles we're the continuation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all the things that the early church stood for and the Catholic church has none of them right all right so we're we're standing in a place look at the next one let's just read it all together proving his word 1964 paragraph 146 so he God came down after going through this and not ever son now ever son excuse me that you eat and born of natural sexual birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims its creation I'd like to stop right there about an hour and claims this creation yeah right right amen amen that's why I don't believe you're going to get a new body right am because the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be in you get a new baptism of the Holy Ghost it's this body redeemed right amen it's not a new body it's not something different it's this body made new amen right in the resurrection right not rep change Etc all come down into fire baptism and claims his creation same as it did him now he's covering the person and the world right everybody know that come on the Holy Ghost and God is a self Same Spirit see it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection yep and he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost I'll raise it up at the last day not one hair of the head will ever perish that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation right of the creation of God amen amen then the whole world has to have a baptism amen why because we yeah yep you see the world follows us right we don't follow the world right we're ahead of the world we don't have the new birth already in the soul the promise of the of the the fiery baptism to cleanse all this out to work that will change this body and bring a resurrection then the world gets all of its doings so we're ahead of it oh yes sir amen why because by the new birth we become part of that beginning of the creation of God that's right he started in Jesus Christ amen he had to pay the price he had to do all the things but then he come into You and I by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what's he doing now already laid claims on these bodies so we don't have to worry about where they're how old they are what Young they are what they look like or whatever we don't worry about it now I know why we're here physically until the change comes We Are a Human Being mortal that's right doomed I'm talking about bodywise right going to the Grave getting older right ain't none of us getting younger you can part your hair and put it in a different way it ain't going to change nothing it don't do it you can everybody can tell you how good looking you are it don't make no difference get old all right but see he I'm going back to a thought the prophet said he was the creator of a finished physical creation right all right that was back there but now do you realize that when he came into the world and he grew up to the age of 30 and there was a river Jordan experience an anointing came on him to claim that body right yes sir and you know that when he claimed that body he claimed you too yes sir amen it's going to take us to go through a change come on we know the story we got to go through a change of the body to be able to be like him that way but the work's already begun amen right he was the beginning of the creation of God and we're the continuation of that creation all right getting ready for a resurrection when he gave you the new birth brother collie he didn't just lay claims on the soul he laid claims on the body and the spirit wherever that Soul goes our body and spirit will go if we're born again Christians all right but he was the beginning of the creation of God and we're the continuation of that creation so then the Bible says one day we will what we'll have a body like under his glorious body right right we'll be like him what in the resurrection but it's already begun right that's the Revelation to the end time right that's a revelation to come to this end time right see he didn't stop creating back there amen he's creating his own Bride come on all right go ahead to number 17 336 Lady of sin Church age Church age book that's right now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age right he called himself the author of the creation of God God right are the beginning of the creation of God right this is another creation uh-oh so he didn't stop creating right this has to do with the church whatever he is we are right that's right this is a special designation of the Bride no no no no no no you're getting too far out see you jumped off this is a special designation of himself remember we're talking about the seed of the woman and we're talking about God using a womb to bring forth the seed of the woman all right true we not true I hope y'all got all night amen he is the creator of the church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride now watch him watch him get so close now remember what he says he created his own Bride Watch what he said as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cell from which his body was born right yes drops right over into it I want to repeat that he created the very very Sal in the W of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human ovium supplied by Mary that would not would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have been not have produced the last Adam of him it was said low a body thou had thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation amen yes amen man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race now he goes into Colossians right and ahead there you can see that that through man though though man was of the old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God right right so he goes to the scripture Ephesians and this new creation is not the old creation made over or it would not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is New Creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with uh Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of a man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is what I love bringing you and I into it bringing us into the new creation then look what he says this is the true revelation of God without you and I in it it wouldn't be no true revelation of God you know that brother around said the godhead is not complete without you you need that quote I'll be sure to give it to you this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when it all would be over all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought right down to the ages now not just the end time his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to P how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church how could he know if it wouldn't by for knowledge predestination for knowledge right receiving Glory from his Brethren I love that if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass what about it right am what about it go to 18 this is Page 15 of this revelation of Jesus Christ which is church age book now remember this Christ in the true church is what a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and poweress it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and a discrediting of God's word right down to the end time he time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people gets the true Revelation right yes sir true Revelation amen of the true church that's right now remember the revelation of God is not complete without the revelation of the church come on and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she'll be an invincible Army right well brother then I just don't see it open your blinded eyes Amen to just be able to exist in this day is a miracle amen that's the true amen that's true argue all you want to I don't have time if they get a true Revelation watch of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand what is the two Spirits doing discrediting of God's word right come on that's right so to be definitely forth as Jesus with stod now think about it what about a situation like this look at 18a this is taken from Oneness I'll put in between thy seed and the seed of the woman telling her what he was going himself to give her a seed not through a intercourse had this while ago he was going to create getting her a seed well you say would that be his seed yes it would belong to Mary then after he give it to her it's going to be her seed all right so what would it be now let's see go to choosing of a bride now the next one paragraph 166 the choosing of the Bride the True Church of Christ the bride is so so hold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you what a different and we find today that the modern Church a modern world church now we're back to two seeds we're back to two wounds right remember Mary eeve W brought death Mary's wound brought life we're back to two wounds two seeds everything watch it Modern World Church and also that the spiritual church are both pregnated to give birth to Sons Amen on Amen right two Wom two seeds right where we started one of them at denominational birth is going to give one day to the to these days at the World Council of churches which will produce to the world Antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that finally that'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she formed the World Council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the Antichrist amen so there's going to be two births in the end time which side are we on the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ finished finished body which is the bride of Christ it isn't finished yet right the body of Christ isn't finished excuse me I said Bri the body of Christ isn't finished yet how manyan he knows that a man and a woman is one in Christ is one body in the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body that's right and the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she that she used no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word y pregnated amen Eve got pregnated and brought forth death Mary became pregnated not by human instrumentality but by cre cretion amen and she gave birth to the word amen the Bride In the End Time amen is to be the one who gives birth to the word am so the seed of the woman is hers right am you followed it y the seed of the woman is her seed right there has to be a birth in the end time yes of the word and that's the seed of the woman see that's why it's called the seed of the woman it has to always stay the seed of the woman right amen we can follow the seed of the Beast and see all the things taking place but it's the seed of the woman this is my eye God gave it to me the bride in the end time is given the word to give birth to amen and it's her seed y you see that's going a little bit too far to say she's the seed of the woman why she brings forth the seed of the woman she the bride of Christ will be the seed of the woman what she gives birth to will be Christ the word right amen that's it amen both are pregnated the bride is give birth to the word s yes sir that's all I've ever tried to preach to you that's all right and when she gives birth to the word that birth of that seed will be the seed of the woman y right now follow the story it's the seed of the woman you see we are the body of Christ amen to give birth to this word the seed so the seed of the woman is exactly right it's her seed God gave it to her the bride is not herself she's himself made manifest that's right okay one more simple thought according to the Book of Revelations there's to be a lamb in the end time Revelations 5 that will take the book am you go with me Jesus Christ back undertook the book right paid the price why is it got to be in the end time because it's to coming forth again of the seed of the woman right Right is coming forth again of the beginning of the creation of God and us being the rest of that creation and what a beautiful picture of that lamb that is to take the book The Lamb that took the book back there was Jesus Christ the lamb that takes the book in the end time has got seven horns and seven eyes right amen read your book of Revelation right what are you trying to save brother day on you sound like you're trying to make us God I wish to the goodness I could get it to to where we could see it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people the Sheep of his Pastor come on were we in the scripture the one that takes a book in the end time is the one who gives birth to the seed of the woman which would be Jesus Christ we're supposed to give birth to the word right right the lamb and the life days has got seven horns and seven eyes where did it come from your Prophet explains where it came from right he said it came from the church ages coming identically back to what was standing in the garden in the garden stood the tree of life that's right amen but also stood the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right amen here stand in the last days what a little bride right trying to become the word the rest of the world taking the seed of the Beast The Serpent and become a world system of churches and wonderful people I've got more on this see there has to be a Remnant oh yeah I ain't got time to get it tonight but I got the notes laying here see there has to be a remnant of the woman's seed if the seat of the woman is Jesus Christ and then comes into bride form there's got to be a Remnant that's your foolish virgin your Prophet said and that's your 144,000 they're the remnant of the seed of the woman well then who's the seed of the woman amen amen if the 144,000 is a Remnant who they are they the remnant of he said of Israel cuz he said that's their but who's the remnant called the foolish virgins we can see her as the remnant of the woman's seat then where's the woman's seat has to be the Bride of Jesus Christ cuz she's the material that's laid down right amen come on am I quoting the prophet am I going in the Bible the remnant of the woman's seed that means that the woman's the material used has got to be the seed of the woman come on I wish we could stay all night I wish you'd read Masterpiece I wish you'd read Masterpiece or listen to the tape and see how that it comes down and it brings it Mary is speaking of Pentecost ausa Street Pentecost Mary who gave birth to Jesus Christ is speaking of ausa Street Pentecost but not only that she's speaking of the original Pentecost the whole thing goes together all right giving birth is one thing but now where is the product that he's given birth to right it's got to be me and you right that's right there's no other type to fit see we are the word right Masterpiece explains it we are the word amen Mary gave birth to the word you and I are not to just give birth to the word we are to be the word amen what's going to change these bodies the revealed word right right realizing what he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for what are we here for number one we're here to strip Satan of all of the things that he ever thought he had that's the number one right number two we are here to strip death from its being and walk off this Earth in a change strip Satan of that unbelief that's in our minds amen and that'll strip him from all power that he's got and death won't be able to take a hold of us you but Brother D you you you you you just make it look like that that we're something no we ain't nothing it is what he has made us right if he chose me to be this why not me except what he chose that's right sister Gail brother dick chose you to be his wife would it be something well well I don't know whether I'm his wife or not I really had never got a revelation and I'm Dick's wife three kids and have many grandkids and come on church I thought we believe we're supposed to be the word come on musicians I thought we believe we're supposed to be the word that's all right if he's the beginning of the creation of God and we're the rest of that creation what's going on am he was the word made flesh according to one John 1:14 we are supposed to be the word made flesh amen and let me quote the prophet we become the word as we receive the word yes sir I'm thinking that that's Easter message or something it's on one of them he said we become the word as we receive the word as that word is revealed we are becoming the word we are becoming the rest of that creation we are becoming the seed of the woman right to give birth to that seed when are we going to start believing it well but brother just don't look good I I tell you what it'd be nice SW with Jesus one day wouldn't it how would you like to be almighty God walking upon this face of this Earth and every religious person that's ever on the Earth was standing there spitting in your face and denying you and doing everything that's right oh it was oh he just had a wonderful time he just he just went around so happy I was this wonderful no that's silly right he was hunted and persecuted he was Tri on every hand he was mocked and ridicu until all turned against him right beaten until he looked like a piece of hamburger meat don't look too good Paul said we ain't strived under whatever we have went Des strived under blood you know think on these things let's stand the seed of the woman becomes a people that can give birth amen amen to the word hallelujah what do we got brother 369

other day when I was I there Sunday when I was trying to bring out that Adam the Covenant with Adam was not on condition of Salvation it was on condition for him not to do nothing right amen but the Salvation Covenant with Adam was unconditional I read to you what the prophet had to say out of Oneness yeah we want to make condition no Adam was under a conditional Covenant brother Dale Adam was but God's covenant has never been show me one conditional Covenant of God in the word of God that's right show me one it says he made a condition he says I will put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman Adam you've done wrong you broke the little thing that I told you to do or not do but I ain't changed my Covenant because I said I was going to do it we'll get to Abraham one of these days with that CU When Abraham comes you got to put two things together and when you get them together you'll see that we're under an unconditional Covenant yes sir promise to save us has never
