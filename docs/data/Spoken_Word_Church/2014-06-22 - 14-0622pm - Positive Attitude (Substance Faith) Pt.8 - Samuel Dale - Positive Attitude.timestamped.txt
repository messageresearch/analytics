[18:34] that the uh the Bible is a book they dug
[18:37] up in the sand I found that not to be
[18:41] true a very basic understanding of
[18:43] History will tell you better than that
[18:45] but people don't are are not
[18:48] learned even in the
[18:50] most the little things I'm glad that I
[18:54] believe a message is for the is for the
[18:56] elderly it's for the middle it's for the
[18:59] young men and women it's for the young
[19:02] children and it's the little children I

[29:54] 10 we're going to go to Hebrews 10 and
[29:58] verse
[30:00] 38 and then we'll read on through

[30:11] father we thank you for this opportunity
[30:13] that we have today that we can come
[30:16] together we had a good time this morning
[30:17] and listen to our brother talk about you

[30:22] time that we desire to sit down and

[30:39] that are away bless each one and guide
[30:41] each and every one of us we love you we
[30:44] thank you keep us now in Jesus name
[30:48] amen now drop back up because of a
[30:52] specific
[30:53] point that I want to bring out and
[30:57] if you'll
[30:59] notice I like the way the brother said
[31:01] this morning about the Bible being a you
[31:04] know
[31:06] continuance continuance it's not just it
[31:09] was cut up and put into uh uh you know
[31:12] what we call verses and things like that
[31:15] by mankind and sometimes they put it the
[31:18] best they could comprehend as to subject
[31:21] matter you know but yet they don't
[31:24] follow the Revelation
[31:26] continually uh you know the way that I
[31:28] look at it sometimes now I don't believe
[31:31] it's like my grandmother my wife's uh
[31:34] grandmother uh and my mother used to
[31:37] write that way too but my wife's
[31:39] grandmother she'd write you a letter and
[31:41] she'd tell you what happened here and
[31:43] what happened there what went on here
[31:44] and what went on there never a perod a
[31:47] question mark or anything you just had
[31:49] to figure out where you stopped and
[31:51] started well that's pretty well way the
[31:53] Bible is and it's really written
[31:54] backwards so that really does confuse us
[31:58] but you know we just we love it anyway
[32:00] love the word look what it says now as a
[32:03] background for Hebrews
[32:07] 11 I could go back all the way through
[32:09] the whole thing but we don't want to do
[32:11] that I just want you to see the
[32:13] background Paul is laying before he says
[32:17] faith is the
[32:18] substance and look at his background now
[32:22] there just shall live by
[32:25] faith but if any man draw back my soul
[32:28] shall have no pleasure in him but we are
[32:31] not of them who draw back unto predition
[32:35] but of them that believe to the saving
[32:36] of the
[32:37] Soul now Faith is the substance of
[32:40] things hope far the evidence of Things
[32:42] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[32:45] good report through faith we understand
[32:48] that the worlds were framed by the word
[32:50] of God so that things which are seen
[32:54] were not made of things which do appear
[32:57] you may be seated the Lord add his
[33:00] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[33:02] I like we'll get to habac just a
[33:05] second I
[33:07] like to think on the scriptures because
[33:10] if you get in Hebrews
[33:11] 11 you'll find that the word by is used
[33:16] like 15 times by Faith by Faith by faith
[33:20] but if you'll notice when we got down to
[33:22] verse three it says through faith we
[33:24] understand that means a continuation of
[33:27] something true it takes it time and then
[33:30] you get over to verse 12 and it says you
[33:34] know through
[33:37] faith sah conceived in other words true
[33:41] means you're traveling through something
[33:43] by is simply stating a point that this
[33:47] is what it is by this all right now we
[33:51] know that it's used in Romans that just
[33:53] shall live by faith it's used in
[33:55] Galatians but each one one of them is
[33:57] stated the same way as to say the just
[34:01] shall live by
[34:03] faith all right now I wish you would go
[34:05] to
[34:06] habca with
[34:08] me this one verse and they can pull it
[34:11] back
[34:12] up and look what it says
[34:16] here behold his
[34:20] soul which is lifted
[34:22] up is not upright in him that's human
[34:25] beings
[34:28] look but the judge shall
[34:31] live by his
[34:35] faith all right now first off that's
[34:39] stating that just shall live by his
[34:42] faith God's faith all right now hold
[34:44] that main thing cuz that's what it
[34:46] is but then a Man Too is living by his
[34:50] own
[34:51] faith and remember what we're talking
[34:54] about trying to have a positive attitude
[34:57] to look at the word and remember the
[35:00] point we're trying to say that
[35:03] see you you have the biggest portion of
[35:07] your faith the prophet says Blasphemous
[35:09] names is what mental
[35:13] Faith oh we like to think we got super
[35:15] duper super duper Faith right but he
[35:18] said the biggest portion of our faith is
[35:20] mental Faith that's taken from paragraph
[35:23] 142 3 4 5 6 of blasphemia name
[35:27] but he said when the when God comes down
[35:31] see mental faith comes by the word of
[35:34] God right anything you get comes by the
[35:37] word of God faith mental Faith you don't
[35:39] get Holy Ghost faith it just drops in
[35:41] you and oh bless I ain't even never read
[35:43] nothing but I got a great
[35:46] Revelation yeah you got one all
[35:51] right but see everything's based on
[35:53] God's word all right but as I said now
[35:57] to take habca he is stipulating that
[36:00] it's by his
[36:02] faith all right now first your faith is
[36:06] just a mental
[36:08] concept so it's right in using that
[36:11] relating to the just shall live by his
[36:15] faith you all right but then it goes
[36:19] into the point of living by God's faith
[36:22] all right because as we said there on
[36:24] Blasphemous night when the Holy Ghost
[36:27] comes down through your mental
[36:30] Faith the prophet said it'll make it a
[36:33] spiritual
[36:35] Revelation all right so now what have we
[36:38] been talking
[36:41] about Hebrews 113 we read there that it
[36:45] says faith cometh by
[36:48] hearing what 11 10 and then we drop down
[36:53] to
[36:54] 11 that it's defining
[36:58] more of what he's talking about in verse
[37:00] 10 or chapter 10
[37:04] that faith
[37:08] is the
[37:11] substance all right now remember last
[37:14] week when we were talking about
[37:16] it we're talking about a substance we'll
[37:19] call this substance faith it kind of get
[37:20] a title from
[37:23] it
[37:24] but if you're me
[37:28] Faith it's a wonderful thing don't lose
[37:32] it because it it it doesn't come
[37:35] spiritual faith it comes mental Faith by
[37:38] hearing the
[37:40] word and then that mental Faith by
[37:43] hearing the word becomes a spiritual
[37:46] Revelation when the Holy Ghost quickens
[37:48] it to you or as we'll get to it later on
[37:51] down in the message when it becomes a
[37:53] revelation to you amen all right but now
[37:56] you think of about which comes first
[37:59] then see
[38:01] faith has to come before anything can be
[38:05] an actual
[38:07] substance all right so our life service
[38:09] we went through speaking about how
[38:12] that God before the world back in his
[38:16] mind he had thoughts of what he wanted
[38:18] to
[38:19] do and then he be to transmit that down
[38:24] and we're talking about that being the f
[38:27] fa there and then he begin to transmit
[38:31] downward and it goes from that point of
[38:35] Faith or
[38:36] God to being the word that he can say
[38:41] Let There be right all right see then
[38:44] it's becoming more to more toward an
[38:47] actual
[38:50] substance but
[38:52] remember he had to speak it the word had
[38:56] had to say it before it become world you
[39:01] know the world was created this was
[39:03] created that was created but before then
[39:07] it was a
[39:10] substance but we couldn't find it you
[39:14] can't show it to somebody cuz Faith is
[39:16] something you can't show nobody else
[39:19] right you alone have it all right now if
[39:23] it's right in our reading then faith
[39:27] is the
[39:29] substance of things hop for so whatever
[39:33] you're hoping
[39:34] for if it's revealed to
[39:37] you you already have the substance right
[39:41] but yet you can't show it to
[39:45] nobody Abraham had a
[39:48] baby but even Sarah couldn't find
[39:52] it right she didn't believe it
[39:57] right she couldn't see it but he saw it
[40:01] am all right now I wonder how many times
[40:04] you've looked up things to just think
[40:06] about
[40:08] it how many times don't raise your hand
[40:10] now but some of you may already know but
[40:14] how many times you think the word faith
[40:16] is used in the Old
[40:22] Testament many ask what times do you
[40:24] think the word faith is used in the old
[40:26] test
[40:29] what' you say sister
[40:32] Gail two
[40:35] times faith is not an Old Testament word
[40:39] right now not meaning they didn't have
[40:46] faith all right meaning that it was not
[40:49] in its
[40:51] Purity to where that it would relate to
[40:54] the word faith
[40:58] all right not meaning they didn't have
[41:00] faith I hope you understand what I'm
[41:02] getting at
[41:03] right but it was called to Abraham it
[41:06] was called
[41:08] believing to uh job it was called I
[41:14] know uh you know a lot of those things
[41:19] were used back there that are different
[41:23] words to Able it was
[41:26] revealed
[41:28] right which would be a better word
[41:31] wouldn't it right it was actually
[41:33] revealed to abble well I believe it was
[41:35] revealed to Abraham don't you right and
[41:38] I believe it was revealed to
[41:41] job but the word faith is not
[41:45] there it's only used the two times
[41:47] that's in the scripture we just
[41:49] read where it talks about but to just
[41:51] shall live by his faith Deuteronomy
[41:54] 32:21 says children in whom is no faith
[41:58] all right it's a new testament
[42:02] word to my way of saying it and that's
[42:04] just my
[42:07] terminology it's something
[42:09] that's
[42:12] real all
[42:14] right
[42:16] now it was real to
[42:21] Abraham okay right 25 years he waited
[42:25] pretty real
[42:29] but yet that word believed or
[42:34] believe is not as strong as the word
[42:36] faith
[42:40] right to say I know it's not as strong
[42:44] you know why because they did not have
[42:48] the faith of God inside of them as a new
[42:51] birth right are you with me right the
[42:55] Old Testament saint never had the new
[42:57] birth amen you couldn't have the new
[43:00] birth until Christ came right right
[43:02] because the Bible said because the Holy
[43:03] Ghost is not been given because Jesus
[43:05] not been
[43:06] glorified people look at the Old
[43:08] Testament you say them people in the Old
[43:10] Testament were not born again boy they
[43:11] just they get all huffy with you about
[43:13] it thinking they had some great
[43:15] Revelation but just
[43:18] remember you cannot have the new birth
[43:21] until Christ come to
[43:23] die that was the thing that would bring
[43:26] a substance within the man amen whereas
[43:31] uh
[43:32] Abraham he would have that believing
[43:35] that
[43:36] anchored and that God could speak to
[43:39] him but yet may I quote the prophet if
[43:44] under the blood of bulls and goats you
[43:47] could have flies fleas and frogs he said
[43:50] why would we stumble at the blood of
[43:53] Jesus
[43:55] Christ what is he meaning he's meaning
[43:58] the capability of bringing anything to
[44:00] being or it's a stronger way of saying
[44:03] it today amen all
[44:07] right Abraham believed
[44:11] God but it never brought him a new birth
[44:14] right it brought a child
[44:17] right right amen because see you you you
[44:21] can't have it back there that's the
[44:23] point you have to look at it but those
[44:25] people back there
[44:27] they had to have a positive
[44:31] attitude you know they thought
[44:34] positive and seemingly sometimes they
[44:37] were more positive than we are that
[44:39] claim the new
[44:41] birth
[44:43] right but see we're we're getting all
[44:45] mixed up in what faith
[44:48] is I've ask you this question each
[44:51] service have you ever had God to reveal
[44:54] something to you that you knew beyond
[44:58] any shadow of a doubt it was coming to
[45:00] pass or had already come to pass or
[45:03] whatever you ever had
[45:05] that if you haven't then you don't know
[45:08] what I'm talking about because you've
[45:10] never experienced it
[45:13] right well a lot of our faith then the
[45:16] prophet said is mental
[45:18] Faith now he says about
[45:22] Christians taken from fellowship by
[45:24] Redemption
[45:27] he said but once faith when but when
[45:30] Once the faith comes down into the
[45:34] compartment down here you know what he's
[45:35] talking about from the head down the
[45:37] heart what
[45:39] happens there's the reason
[45:44] people doesn't get where they should be
[45:48] it becomes a mental concept of God
[45:52] now come down with
[45:54] me
[45:56] by you believing him by an intellectual
[46:01] Faith but that won't do it it's got to
[46:05] be a born again
[46:06] experience where your faith is brought
[46:09] down into this compartment here and no
[46:12] matter what it looks like faith says it
[46:15] so anyhow right
[46:18] now remember what we've been dealing
[46:20] with
[46:23] though we've been dealing with
[46:27] the point of saying
[46:30] that you can be sick today right and be
[46:33] healed of
[46:35] that and die tomorrow with the same
[46:40] thing well you just didn't get it no
[46:43] what your Prophet said you did so you
[46:46] argue with him you
[46:48] know and he said in explaining
[46:52] it he said
[46:54] Peter had had a
[46:57] substance He Walked on
[46:59] Water perfect Faith but he said he lost
[47:03] his
[47:06] substance right he began to fall right
[47:11] we said he held his
[47:15] profession all right you remember he
[47:18] looks up he's sinking down I don't
[47:20] believe he goes you know I believe he
[47:22] just starts sinking his way and he looks
[47:25] up and he says Lord help me he still had
[47:29] a great confession because he realized
[47:31] that was the only help he had or hope he
[47:35] had so he kept his profession and you
[47:38] know what his profession walked him back
[47:40] in the
[47:42] boat but he had lost his substance all
[47:45] right so it's possible now to be
[47:49] healed and lose the
[47:52] substance right you go back to a mental
[47:55] statement
[47:57] but it's impossible now to be born
[48:01] again and lose the substance of your
[48:04] salvation now you can be at
[48:06] justification you can be at
[48:10] sanctification and you can lose that
[48:13] substance part that you
[48:15] have and you can lose that salvation but
[48:19] there's no way to lose the new birth
[48:23] right amen you know is no way but now
[48:27] remember the difference why we use and
[48:29] then Faith becomes a new testament word
[48:32] is because those Old Testament people
[48:35] never had that new birth
[48:37] right no now I'll get to it when we get
[48:41] back on to it brother Brandon was
[48:42] talking about the woman that touched the
[48:44] him of His
[48:46] Garment and he says she had faith for
[48:49] that time
[48:54] right and she could be here
[48:56] healed he said the disciples were
[48:58] casting out
[49:00] Devils we know that's in the Bible
[49:03] right but when they come to that
[49:05] epileptic child they couldn't cast it
[49:08] out he said see they didn't have perfect
[49:11] Faith he said
[49:14] because it's hard to have perfect faith
[49:17] without the Holy Ghost right he said
[49:19] because it brings it right all
[49:23] right but now remember the point we
[49:25] getting
[49:28] that
[49:31] faith is the
[49:34] substance now it doesn't say faith might
[49:37] be a substance could be a
[49:39] substance that goes into the words
[49:45] hope but it says faith is the substance
[49:49] well now to
[49:50] God and remember backing up where he was
[49:54] and then he CES to sins and then and he
[49:55] speaks it and the world comes into being
[49:57] but remember the
[49:59] world in the mind of
[50:02] God was just as real as the substance
[50:06] that
[50:07] came I peed on the pull pit to make the
[50:09] point to what you're talking about
[50:10] something
[50:11] hard see the world that was spoken into
[50:14] existence was in his
[50:16] mind all right now in his
[50:18] mind that faith is what it
[50:24] is the certain of things was just that
[50:27] Faith transmitted down to become a
[50:30] substance as we call
[50:32] it all
[50:35] right see then faith is the
[50:40] substance
[50:43] okay of whatever you're asking
[50:48] for but see we don't believe it that way
[50:50] we we believe it in a mental
[50:54] concept
[50:56] we say I'm
[50:58] Healed right and we have a good
[51:02] confession but sight and time what the
[51:05] prophet say God's worst enemies all
[51:07] right so let it go a little
[51:09] while and after a while you begin to
[51:12] deteriorate in your
[51:17] faith see then you'll say well I I need
[51:20] to go to the doctor I
[51:22] guess well I don't see no reason why you
[51:25] should went to start
[51:28] with unless God tells
[51:31] you now if he tells you don't worry
[51:33] about
[51:34] it but see there's our propped up super
[51:36] duper
[51:38] thing now remember keep the point in
[51:44] mind everybody awaking up keep the point
[51:47] in mind salvation can't be
[51:50] lost truly Born Again experience can't
[51:53] be lost amen you receive the person of
[51:57] Jesus Christ in the New Birth you you
[51:59] can't lose
[52:00] that you remember the man on the Hebrew
[52:02] series that was a preacher just quit
[52:05] preaching went out and got in some beer
[52:06] and sat down and said I ain't going to
[52:07] preach no more it wasn't long he is gone
[52:10] the prophet said God couldn't let him
[52:12] Mar his name he took his child
[52:17] home but in healings and
[52:20] things we can have it and lose it have
[52:23] it and lose it H that's why the problem
[52:27] is that we look at healing like this say
[52:30] you're healed of
[52:32] a of a bad headache or
[52:35] something well a few weeks later you
[52:38] have a hurting in your leg you
[52:42] know and our doings most of the time is
[52:45] to say I got healed of the headache I'm
[52:48] Healed of this uh-uh you got to come
[52:51] back
[52:52] again you don't get it because you got
[52:55] it
[52:56] before healing is not based on that
[52:59] basis healing is based on an individual
[53:02] now don't get me wrong that's good faith
[53:06] Builder that's good faith Builder to
[53:08] realize you was
[53:11] healed but that don't heal
[53:14] you right we'll get down in a little
[53:16] while where the Prophet was talking
[53:18] about if I had the quarter I got the
[53:23] bread but remember the quarters is not
[53:25] the
[53:28] substance we got that wrote down
[53:31] too the quarter is not the
[53:34] substance it's only the purchasing
[53:37] power we're talking about a
[53:40] substance and Webster says substance is
[53:44] what anything consist
[53:47] of but it's in a material matter or Etc
[53:52] I gave them to you the other day
[53:54] physical
[53:55] matter or
[53:58] material that's what Webster says about
[54:00] substance something that has a separate
[54:03] or independent
[54:07] existence all right it's something
[54:10] real in your strong concordance
[54:14] 5287 that which has actual
[54:19] existence real
[54:21] being
[54:24] Foundation subst structive or
[54:27] structure it actually means a
[54:30] person that's what the word substance
[54:32] comes out to be from strong concordance
[54:36] all
[54:37] right
[54:39] now remember which one comes
[54:43] first faith has got to be
[54:47] there before the substance will ever
[54:49] come into
[54:51] being
[54:53] right all right
[54:57] and see once the once it comes into
[55:00] being to an actual
[55:02] substance now once it come to
[55:06] this now listen to what I'm saying this
[55:09] is not
[55:10] substance you say what is it it's an oak
[55:14] tree it's an actual
[55:18] fact the dirt you stand on the car you
[55:20] drove up here with is not a
[55:24] substance that's an actual
[55:28] fact you don't have to have faith for a
[55:31] shirt on today do you I don't see any
[55:34] men in here without
[55:37] any amen that's an actual
[55:41] fact and see that's why it's so easy for
[55:44] us to think
[55:46] yes I believe I'm Healed but now when
[55:49] I'm delivered I'll confess
[55:54] it
[55:56] actually you're
[56:00] saying when I get it I'll tell everybody
[56:03] I got it and our big super duper what's
[56:06] my favorite saying our big super duper
[56:10] thing
[56:12] is you you need to confess you're healed
[56:15] yeah but I'm not
[56:17] healed and if I say I'm Healed and I'm
[56:20] not healed I'm a
[56:23] line
[56:27] huh you don't never have that to come in
[56:30] your
[56:32] mind when God delivers me I'll say I'm
[56:37] Healed well you can never be healed and
[56:39] can never be
[56:40] saved because mental faith is not a
[56:45] substance mental faith is not a
[56:48] substance it's a
[56:51] hope it's a believing a
[56:53] wish
[56:58] no matter then who it is that's why a
[57:00] sinner can receive
[57:05] healing brother brother said have
[57:07] prostitutes cross the platform and be
[57:10] healed real genuine Saints cross the
[57:13] platform and not receive their
[57:17] healing you remember
[57:19] that but you know
[57:22] what you take that prostitute and you do
[57:25] like brother randam did one day in a
[57:27] prayer line he said little girl and the
[57:29] mother came
[57:32] and he said now ain't you
[57:34] ashamed to come up here to want to be
[57:37] healed when you're
[57:39] lost said you to accept Jesus Christ
[57:43] first and he said they accepted Jesus
[57:45] Christ and he said you know what
[57:46] happened they was healed right or the
[57:49] little girl was but you see that's the
[57:52] way we do it we make it we're so super
[57:54] duper
[57:56] religious until we totally deny the word
[57:58] of
[58:00] God you got to say you're
[58:03] healed before you can be healed you got
[58:07] to say you're saved before you can be
[58:09] saved it ain't something falling out of
[58:12] Heaven it just flops along you
[58:15] know but when it
[58:18] comes have you ever heard the prophet
[58:20] say this he said faith is very simple
[58:27] faith is very
[58:32] simple you know what the prophet said he
[58:35] first does
[58:38] it then he reveals
[58:41] it and then he makes it
[58:44] manifest you remember
[58:48] those all
[58:51] right even in Salvation Romans says
[58:56] confess with your mouth believe in your
[58:58] heart shall be saved but see we get up
[59:02] and we say I said
[59:04] it I believe it so I got
[59:09] it
[59:11] well you
[59:13] know somebody might have done that and
[59:16] received
[59:18] it because I'm as honest as I can say to
[59:21] you I've been healed of a many of thing
[59:24] you know
[59:25] that from high blood pressure to eyes
[59:28] that couldn't see to my blood type
[59:30] totally changed from a positive a
[59:33] negative medically proven you want to
[59:36] talk to these nurses about what they'll
[59:38] tell you if you say that stupid can't be
[59:40] done only your records prove
[59:43] it but you know every time God's ever
[59:46] touched me that way he didn't holler and
[59:48] scream at me and explain it to me he
[59:51] just simply took care of it right right
[59:55] yes
[59:56] sir that's why we're looking for Faith
[59:58] to be something
[1:00:00] great you
[1:00:03] know some kind of a marvelous thing that
[1:00:09] happens and we feel it we emotionally
[1:00:13] you
[1:00:14] know are elated we we do many things and
[1:00:17] those things are wonderful but may I
[1:00:19] quote the prophet he said if you need
[1:00:22] them things God will let you have them
[1:00:24] but he said you're not supposed to have
[1:00:26] do it that way he said you're supposed
[1:00:28] to believe what the word
[1:00:30] says Brother D you don't believe in
[1:00:32] being
[1:00:34] emotional I just explained it I believe
[1:00:38] in being
[1:00:39] emotional because of what God has
[1:00:43] already done amen I'm not going to shout
[1:00:46] my way into being healed if I can do
[1:00:49] that I don't need Jesus at
[1:00:52] Calvary I didn't need his stripes
[1:00:56] I could shake myself into
[1:00:59] it see what does it mean to you when you
[1:01:02] actually read that faith is the
[1:01:10] substance what does it actually mean to
[1:01:17] you see if you ever really see what it
[1:01:19] is you'll realize why the prophet would
[1:01:20] say faith is more real than anything you
[1:01:23] can see taste f smell or
[1:01:30] here it's more
[1:01:33] real it's a
[1:01:36] substance and a substance is what
[1:01:38] anything consist
[1:01:42] of you remember the one we gave the
[1:01:44] other day I won't get back over to it
[1:01:45] but where the Prophet said where it said
[1:01:47] and the evidence of Things Not Seen he
[1:01:50] says now if it's an Evidence it's got to
[1:01:53] be a substance
[1:01:55] first
[1:01:58] right when it sickens me I know I'm old
[1:02:02] Dy granddaddy I'm sorry and I don't mean
[1:02:05] this wrong I always just say what I mean
[1:02:07] and mean what I say and forget
[1:02:10] it but you have a wreck happen out here
[1:02:12] on the
[1:02:14] highway and two hours later they get the
[1:02:16] news media out
[1:02:18] there you
[1:02:20] know and they're view viewing and taking
[1:02:23] pictures of the car and
[1:02:26] that and then they want somebody to tell
[1:02:29] them what
[1:02:31] happened I'll leave out them other words
[1:02:33] where I talk about the fat lady is
[1:02:35] generally the one that does it but I'll
[1:02:37] go on to the other but you know what I'm
[1:02:39] talking about the truth the
[1:02:42] loudmouth person in the crowd that
[1:02:45] wasn't there showed up 5 minutes before
[1:02:48] the news crew got there but they tell
[1:02:50] them all about what happened at the
[1:02:53] wck
[1:02:56] right am I
[1:02:59] true you go to court with that what does
[1:03:03] the court say I many of you ever said on
[1:03:06] jury here says no
[1:03:08] evidence they say did you see the wreck
[1:03:11] no go sit down shut up but I tell you I
[1:03:13] saw this shut
[1:03:16] up cuz you don't know what's going
[1:03:20] on see if it's an
[1:03:23] Evidence an Evidence is a fact that can
[1:03:27] be proven you want the Webster's
[1:03:29] Dictionary on that
[1:03:31] one an Evidence is something that can be
[1:03:36] proven you witnessed the
[1:03:42] wreck then you can put that in the
[1:03:45] testimony
[1:03:47] right see how many of us is actually
[1:03:49] witnessed in her own experience come
[1:03:53] on yes and mainly where does experience
[1:03:58] change
[1:04:05] people come
[1:04:08] on you said boy when I come into the
[1:04:10] message I quit cutting my hair I quit
[1:04:12] painting my face I quit wearing them
[1:04:14] clothes I quit but I was born again 10
[1:04:16] years before
[1:04:22] then something's wrong right amen
[1:04:26] somewhere I thought the new birth was to
[1:04:29] bring a new life right a new doings
[1:04:34] right I didn't have to quit smoking when
[1:04:36] I come in this message I didn't have to
[1:04:38] quit
[1:04:40] drinking why because I didn't do it
[1:04:42] before I came in the
[1:04:45] message well brother D you just like to
[1:04:47] be different go GL praise God I'm
[1:04:50] Different what's the matter with you you
[1:04:53] mean you got to to be told it's wrong by
[1:04:55] a
[1:04:56] prophet when the word of God says don't
[1:05:00] do it that's
[1:05:05] right I mean was it all right to commit
[1:05:08] adultery run around with women and do
[1:05:10] all kind of garbage but when I heard the
[1:05:12] message I had to quit but I was born
[1:05:19] again see those things going into our
[1:05:21] mental
[1:05:23] faith
[1:05:27] brother R said you can't get a holy
[1:05:29] ghost fied woman to put on a PR of
[1:05:31] pants now you go do what you want to
[1:05:33] with that he didn't say he said it he
[1:05:36] said you can't get it
[1:05:37] done well brother D I done it well
[1:05:41] then yeah you're the one admitted your
[1:05:43] loss not me right yeah but I don't like
[1:05:47] it that's what it is you don't like for
[1:05:48] me to be blunt what can't we be blunt
[1:05:51] amen you'll never get nowhere trying to
[1:05:54] to figure out what faith is by being
[1:05:56] diddle doly and play around and well
[1:05:58] yeah boy I believe that I believe
[1:06:01] that the times God has healed me I
[1:06:04] simply just confess my way into it and
[1:06:06] walk right toward
[1:06:08] it and all at once it was
[1:06:14] gone I wore glasses for eight
[1:06:19] years couldn't shoot a gun because the
[1:06:21] iron sights fuzzed on and to go to a
[1:06:25] look out and everything was
[1:06:28] wavy I wore glasses to take care of
[1:06:31] that one day I came right here and I
[1:06:33] said and on the way I said God you know
[1:06:36] I'll use my eyes for
[1:06:38] you and I read and I study would you
[1:06:41] just please take it away I had a church
[1:06:43] to pray for him he went to the ey doctor
[1:06:45] and he said what are you doing wearing
[1:06:49] glces been wearing for eight years why
[1:06:53] he said you got
[1:06:56] 2020 you know what I went in there fuzzy
[1:07:00] and couldn't tell what everything was I
[1:07:02] came out of there seeing as clear as a
[1:07:05] crystal and you see me reading this
[1:07:09] print 74 years old and can still read
[1:07:12] Bible print under a good light situation
[1:07:16] I use glasses to read why cuz you get a
[1:07:18] headache if you
[1:07:20] don't but what's my point my point is we
[1:07:24] want to make some super duper thing to
[1:07:26] happen and if something super duper
[1:07:29] happens we believe
[1:07:33] it w't you just walk right into
[1:07:37] it brother col's wife there years ago
[1:07:41] they had to take her ptary every how you
[1:07:43] pronounce that big old word gland out
[1:07:45] back
[1:07:46] here they take it out which means you're
[1:07:50] automatically a
[1:07:51] diabetic right because there just
[1:07:54] nothing to that gland is what
[1:07:56] produces she got to get in being sick go
[1:07:59] we done told her said and they gave her
[1:08:01] the medicine we told her simple little
[1:08:04] illustration I said just sanctify that
[1:08:06] medicine before you take
[1:08:09] it how many of you sanctify your
[1:08:12] medicine before you take
[1:08:15] it in our medicine cabinet there's a
[1:08:18] prayer
[1:08:20] cloth in case I forget ask to sanctify
[1:08:24] the
[1:08:25] medicine amen so sister Ruth goes to the
[1:08:28] doctor got her because she was sick and
[1:08:31] the doctor saids for some reason your
[1:08:33] body is supplying insulin just don't
[1:08:35] take no
[1:08:38] more well you
[1:08:40] know you ever heard r r make this
[1:08:43] statement he said God draws millions of
[1:08:45] gallons of water out of the ocean every
[1:08:47] day and don't make one bit of sound
[1:08:51] right but yet we think it's got to be
[1:08:53] super duper
[1:08:55] oh yes just something great happens if I
[1:08:57] saw a vision Brother D I believe I was
[1:08:59] healed the devil can give you one now
[1:09:01] what are you going to do with that right
[1:09:05] yeah if you'll pray for me brother Dale
[1:09:07] and I feel cold chills run all over
[1:09:11] me I'll be
[1:09:14] healed well that's only going to set you
[1:09:16] up for the next time because it may
[1:09:18] happen that time and the next time when
[1:09:19] you really need
[1:09:22] it
[1:09:25] right and when you really need it it
[1:09:26] won't come why because you're dependent
[1:09:29] on a
[1:09:29] sensation but
[1:09:31] listen faith is the
[1:09:37] substance it's an actual
[1:09:40] substance you just I'm going read from
[1:09:43] Brother you just can't show it to nobody
[1:09:46] else show me one
[1:09:52] God
[1:09:54] show me one
[1:09:56] God you can't do it you actually got to
[1:10:00] believe something that science says is
[1:10:04] impossible but the Bible said he that
[1:10:06] cometh to God must believe
[1:10:09] what that he
[1:10:12] is not was or maybe will be he
[1:10:16] is right a positive attitude will always
[1:10:20] come from things that are present
[1:10:22] tense you remember
[1:10:26] Moses mama told him his deliver all he
[1:10:28] heard all of his
[1:10:30] life got him must stinking dead Egyptian
[1:10:33] and run out of
[1:10:34] the the
[1:10:37] country for five minutes at a burning
[1:10:40] bush he walked out of there ready to go
[1:10:42] take over in Egypt and he
[1:10:46] did a lot of difference in just
[1:10:49] a
[1:10:52] confession but but we must
[1:10:54] confess
[1:10:56] right right brother the gir's daddy
[1:10:58] would tell you what 50 or 80% or
[1:11:00] something he was a doctor about 80 90%
[1:11:03] of the people get well they told them
[1:11:04] when they started Medical School said
[1:11:06] the biggest portion of people will get
[1:11:07] well if you don't hinder
[1:11:13] them and he said I try to get people to
[1:11:16] believe like I explained the other day
[1:11:18] you go in and they got this new medicine
[1:11:20] we want you to try this new medicine you
[1:11:22] you got this cancer you got that once
[1:11:24] you try this new medicine we've been
[1:11:25] using it for a year or two now only had
[1:11:27] one patient that was healed we've had
[1:11:30] 10,000
[1:11:31] died you're not going to take that
[1:11:35] medicine and the idiot that was trying
[1:11:37] to sell it to you order to know
[1:11:40] better but if you go in there this
[1:11:43] product
[1:11:45] 95% delivery rate from this product
[1:11:48] you're willing to train take a change
[1:11:50] ain't you you know what he's trying to
[1:11:51] do touch your mental
[1:11:54] capacity of your
[1:11:58] being like I've always said the boy that
[1:12:01] broke the 4-minute mile was an invalid
[1:12:04] That was supposed to have never been
[1:12:05] able to
[1:12:10] walk but you know what they forgot to
[1:12:12] tell him that's you know they forgot to
[1:12:15] tell the Bumblebee that it can't fly but
[1:12:19] scientifically it cannot
[1:12:22] fly but you know does every
[1:12:26] day but see faith is the substance now
[1:12:30] what you're asking
[1:12:33] for is not in the substance after you
[1:12:37] get it that's a
[1:12:40] fact it's in asking
[1:12:44] God when you have nothing to
[1:12:49] show sure if he
[1:12:52] better that's good but what if you get
[1:12:56] worse there's where we lose it right I
[1:12:59] was prayed for but I got
[1:13:01] worse well what did the prophet say the
[1:13:05] greatest sign that you're healed is you
[1:13:07] get
[1:13:09] sicker we don't want to quote
[1:13:14] that but you understand what I
[1:13:18] mean my nephew was laying in the
[1:13:20] hospital
[1:13:22] with
[1:13:23] roast what do you call it multiple
[1:13:27] it ftic but it was in the lungs which
[1:13:31] means they fill totally up one of them
[1:13:33] finally rung up they done a double lung
[1:13:35] transplant on him and he's doing
[1:13:37] wonderful thank God but you know what
[1:13:40] when he was a little bitty fell they
[1:13:42] gave him
[1:13:45] up I saw a brother Ben Howard up at
[1:13:49] Gainesville I said where you going Ben
[1:13:51] he said I'm going down here to pray for
[1:13:52] somebody I said I said come on I said
[1:13:55] we're going to pray for my nephew they
[1:13:57] done give up and told him it was nothing
[1:13:58] they could
[1:14:00] do we walked in the
[1:14:02] room didn't spend no big a lot amount of
[1:14:05] time simply turned around prayed a
[1:14:07] prayor walked out of the
[1:14:09] room you know
[1:14:12] what that's about 30 something years ago
[1:14:15] I
[1:14:19] guess
[1:14:22] 40 he's still
[1:14:25] alive but see we don't think about faith
[1:14:29] as being
[1:14:31] simple if we got something to to link it
[1:14:36] to but that's not what the Bible say
[1:14:40] right the Bible doesn't say
[1:14:42] substance is something you link your
[1:14:45] things to and then it becomes
[1:14:48] Faith no no come on it I know where the
[1:14:51] Prophet said if you got something that
[1:14:53] that's a scientific fact I don't have to
[1:14:56] ask for a shirt I've got one
[1:15:00] on but when you got to stand
[1:15:03] there without any
[1:15:06] form of real evidence that you can show
[1:15:08] anybody
[1:15:10] else but stand there and say by Stripes
[1:15:13] I'm
[1:15:17] Healed you see a lot of people have
[1:15:19] never done that so they don't really
[1:15:20] know what faith is I'm just going to
[1:15:22] make mistake to forget it then I wonder
[1:15:25] what they're linking their salvation
[1:15:28] to if you're linking your your healing
[1:15:30] to a mental concept that if you can feel
[1:15:33] better you'll say you're healed then if
[1:15:35] you you're a sinner and you say well if
[1:15:37] I quit sinning I'll figure out I'm a
[1:15:38] Christian and that's actually what
[1:15:40] you're saying
[1:15:42] right I thought we believed in
[1:15:44] Deliverance I didn't know we believed in
[1:15:46] quitting or sieling out something you
[1:15:49] know make it it's easy to believe when
[1:15:51] you prayed far and think starts
[1:15:53] happening to the
[1:15:56] good but when they start happening to
[1:15:58] the
[1:16:00] bad right what are you going to
[1:16:04] do but see you're not getting the
[1:16:10] scripture faith is the
[1:16:16] substance of the things you hope
[1:16:19] for so whatever you want
[1:16:28] faith is the substance of
[1:16:33] that see now you've gone back beyond the
[1:16:40] natural so you're going to beond the
[1:16:42] natural thing because it's easy to have
[1:16:45] a to have a substance in claim I've got
[1:16:47] a
[1:16:49] substance but wasn't it something with
[1:16:52] Abraham
[1:16:53] 25 years you know
[1:16:57] Abraham
[1:17:00] means High
[1:17:03] father
[1:17:05] right everybody comes up to him and say
[1:17:08] high
[1:17:09] father how many kids you got don't have
[1:17:12] any well you're lying cuz your name says
[1:17:15] your
[1:17:16] father is that back to what we talking
[1:17:18] about a while
[1:17:19] ago I I I don't want to lie now but
[1:17:23] because I I I'm I'm not a
[1:17:26] liar and and and I'm not going to say
[1:17:29] I'm Healed until I am well don't worry
[1:17:31] about you ain't going to never be
[1:17:33] healed you're a liar when you won't say
[1:17:35] it cuz the Bible says you're healed
[1:17:41] amen there
[1:17:44] Abraham one day God met up with him
[1:17:46] again again
[1:17:48] again right and one day he changed his
[1:17:52] name from Abram to Abraham which Abram
[1:17:55] means High
[1:17:57] Father Abraham means father of
[1:18:02] Nations you're how you doing Abram my
[1:18:06] name's been
[1:18:07] changed oh what happened when a been
[1:18:10] changed Abraham oh father of Nations
[1:18:13] that means you got a bunch of
[1:18:16] kids you know back then polygamy was
[1:18:18] illegal and he could probably had about
[1:18:20] 10 one
[1:18:21] year
[1:18:26] he still didn't have a thing in the
[1:18:30] world right and God done changed his
[1:18:33] name and made him father of
[1:18:40] Nations
[1:18:43] well you know what he got a hold of
[1:18:45] something that was real
[1:18:48] right that's what I mean by asking the
[1:18:50] question have you ever had an experience
[1:18:52] right right what are you basing your
[1:18:55] salvation
[1:19:00] on what is your
[1:19:07] experience well I come into the
[1:19:09] message I believe God sent a prophet
[1:19:12] devil doesn't beat you to it that's
[1:19:14] right he does all
[1:19:17] them what is your evidence something
[1:19:21] that you can prove
[1:19:24] prove I don't have to prove to you I'm
[1:19:27] saved bless God well I know you're not
[1:19:29] then if you start out that yak it
[1:19:33] Yak but you see faith it says is the
[1:19:40] substance if you got faith you already
[1:19:42] got
[1:19:43] it that's where our problem's at we try
[1:19:46] to work our way up into getting
[1:19:48] it if you got faith you've already got
[1:19:51] it it's an actual
[1:19:59] substance but see Peter had a good
[1:20:04] substance but he lost
[1:20:10] it you cannot be healed the prophet said
[1:20:13] by mental
[1:20:16] faith it won't heal
[1:20:20] you don't do away with it CU you got to
[1:20:23] start
[1:20:26] somewhere but you can't be saved by
[1:20:28] mental
[1:20:30] Faith it's got to turn out to be his
[1:20:33] Revelation his
[1:20:34] faith right that's why I hope you
[1:20:37] understand what I
[1:20:39] meant that that word faith is not in the
[1:20:41] Old Testament those but those two times
[1:20:44] well because they didn't
[1:20:47] have the new birth
[1:20:49] experience to be able to say the life
[1:20:52] that I now live by the faith I live by
[1:20:56] the faith of
[1:21:00] God they couldn't say that as Paul could
[1:21:03] but what about
[1:21:06] it see substance is what you
[1:21:11] desire right you want to see it hear it
[1:21:14] feel it smell
[1:21:17] it but
[1:21:19] faith is something that you don't see
[1:21:22] taste feel smell or
[1:21:25] here so now why would you want to feel
[1:21:27] it why would you want to say when I feel
[1:21:29] better I'll say I'm Healed don't worry
[1:21:31] about it go and
[1:21:36] die put your salvation on it like that
[1:21:40] when I feel good I'll say I'm saved if I
[1:21:43] don't feel good today I'll say I'm not
[1:21:45] saved today
[1:21:48] well you know what you going to
[1:21:51] do
[1:21:54] but did you ever just thought about
[1:21:57] it I know you have mentally but have you
[1:21:59] ever asked God to reveal it to you cuz
[1:22:03] brother around said we need a revelation
[1:22:04] more than
[1:22:07] anything you know you can't be saved
[1:22:09] without a
[1:22:10] revelation what about the man that told
[1:22:12] brother brandom he didn't believe in
[1:22:17] Revelation what about the people of this
[1:22:20] message they believe brother brandham
[1:22:22] had to Revelation that's why I'm
[1:22:27] saved

[1:28:13] mobile you know they even got them now
[1:28:16] it's got the machines on it you know I
[1:28:18] watched my wife when she was going
[1:28:20] through hers you know put on that thing
[1:28:21] that d straighten the leg and pull it
[1:28:23] back out I said man if I get me one of
[1:28:25] them just installed I could walk good
[1:28:28] you
[1:28:28] know right yeah but do you understand
[1:28:32] what I'm getting
[1:28:34] at Faith is not
[1:28:40] imagination it's not a myth I'm looking
[1:28:43] at the quotes from the
[1:28:46] prophet he said you actually possess
[1:28:49] it but you can't show it to no nobody
[1:28:58] else
[1:29:01] substance that's why a person right over
[1:29:03] here can be
[1:29:06] healed more healings per buildings of
[1:29:10] what we would call the people outside of
[1:29:12] the message one more healings with them
[1:29:14] than they are with
[1:29:16] us
[1:29:18] right you know why they can do it
[1:29:21] because they're not cond
[1:29:23] DED you stop as I said that woman that
[1:29:25] was a prostitute and you tell her ain't
[1:29:27] you ashamed coming up here in this
[1:29:29] church and you being a prostitute she
[1:29:31] ain't going to get
[1:29:33] healed cuz you just blocked her
[1:29:36] mentals part of
[1:29:40] her see faith is the substance the Bible
[1:29:45] says it's his
[1:29:50] faith
[1:29:54] his
[1:29:58] faith it goes all the way back to him
[1:30:01] that's why the Bible says when you're
[1:30:03] brought to the FL do what did it say
[1:30:06] take no thought for what you're to
[1:30:08] say said it will be given to you at that
[1:30:14] time well we going to court I got this
[1:30:16] figured out because and I know they're
[1:30:17] going to say this and I'm going to say
[1:30:18] that they're going to say this I'm going
[1:30:19] to say that you just wasted today why
[1:30:21] don't you go take a
[1:30:23] nap course it ain't going to be that way
[1:30:26] anyway you get in there and they're
[1:30:27] going to trick you and trap you and
[1:30:29] everything in the book
[1:30:34] right but you see
[1:30:37] church if you've ever experienced
[1:30:44] something most people have never seen
[1:30:47] God in a ways that brother said some are
[1:30:50] chosen to see it
[1:30:53] to where they can explain to
[1:30:55] others and they can't talk about seeing
[1:30:59] God it's just
[1:31:01] mental it's just being good going to
[1:31:03] church believing God sent a
[1:31:08] prophet trying to live right and do
[1:31:13] right that's why Church you know I don't
[1:31:16] I don't preach on women's hir and dress
[1:31:17] and clothes I bring it in the sermon
[1:31:20] every once in a while
[1:31:22] cuz I see some that don't do right and I
[1:31:25] bring it out and mention it but I've
[1:31:28] never seen a church yet where they
[1:31:29] preach clothline Holiness and that all
[1:31:32] that ever preach that ever amounted to
[1:31:35] anything you want to meet me at a
[1:31:37] service we'll talk about
[1:31:40] them I'm not talking to your body I'm
[1:31:42] trying to talk to your
[1:31:45] soul cuz that's where the new birth is
[1:31:47] at and that's where faith is
[1:31:50] laying if if you have
[1:31:54] it it's laying within that Soul cuz
[1:31:57] that's the only way you can be born
[1:31:58] again it's for God to come and live in
[1:32:01] you amen
[1:32:03] right see if I talk to that one inside
[1:32:06] of you he'll just come right out and
[1:32:08] tell the body what to
[1:32:10] do we have women come in here newcomers
[1:32:14] and things
[1:32:16] what oh boy most preachers what do they
[1:32:20] want
[1:32:23] boy I'll tell you what God revealed to
[1:32:25] me this week no he revealed to me about
[1:32:28] two minutes ago when he seen that short
[1:32:29] dress coming in the door and like I've
[1:32:32] always told them if theyd stay out of
[1:32:35] Walmart you don't know what I mean by
[1:32:37] that I heard a preacher one night he
[1:32:39] said I didn't have nothing to preach I
[1:32:41] went down to Walmart walked around said
[1:32:43] I got something and all he preached was
[1:32:45] on women in their clothes and their how
[1:32:48] they
[1:32:50] looked
[1:32:54] we see faith is a
[1:32:56] revelation
[1:32:59] right has God ever revealed to you that
[1:33:01] you're
[1:33:03] healed now let me explain that Brother
[1:33:06] Gary was here one
[1:33:09] night he had a real bad
[1:33:12] headache and he has those kind of
[1:33:14] headaches that he's just honest that if
[1:33:17] it do his head any good to take a gun
[1:33:19] out and shoot somebody else's head off
[1:33:22] he do it because it's so severe I've
[1:33:24] never hurt like that my wife's had him
[1:33:25] to pass out with him I've never hurt
[1:33:27] like that I've been blessed all my life
[1:33:30] been real
[1:33:33] healthy but he was supposed to come up
[1:33:35] here and let me pray for him and he
[1:33:38] didn't do it he went down the
[1:33:40] road if I miss the story he can tell all
[1:33:42] of
[1:33:45] it something
[1:33:47] happened and all it was if you just
[1:33:49] believe that you're healed it's
[1:33:54] gone and you know what it was
[1:33:59] gone have you ever had that to
[1:34:03] happen see you don't know what I'm
[1:34:05] talking about if you've never
[1:34:08] had most people don't know what I'm
[1:34:10] talking about but yet they don't
[1:34:13] understand what God has done through
[1:34:14] their
[1:34:15] life as I said it wasn't a super duper
[1:34:18] Halo light come on in the car and all
[1:34:20] these ringing and all this superpower
[1:34:24] come
[1:34:26] in it was just a
[1:34:28] knowledge that come to a man's
[1:34:31] mind and it went from his mind into his
[1:34:35] soul and brought out a reality of a
[1:34:38] deliverance and you realize that a lot
[1:34:40] of you have had that and don't know
[1:34:46] it you've had a lot of things happen and
[1:34:49] don't realize
[1:34:50] it that is in the realm of
[1:34:56] Faith have you ever just been to a place
[1:34:58] where you
[1:34:59] said I don't know why but I believe
[1:35:04] this and you know what take
[1:35:07] place now now who done
[1:35:09] that let's don't blame the Boogerman for
[1:35:12] it
[1:35:17] okay just simple little things has
[1:35:19] happened in life
[1:35:24] that you would call it and not even
[1:35:27] think about
[1:35:29] faith but you were driving down the
[1:35:31] highway and you were supposed to go this
[1:35:34] way maybe the shorter
[1:35:38] way and you just turn and go the other
[1:35:44] way and you got home and find out they
[1:35:46] had a bad wreck over
[1:35:50] there
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:54] see this thing might not be as py
[1:35:56] patterned setting flat blunt as we think
[1:35:59] it
[1:35:59] is it might be that God just allows
[1:36:02] mankind to walk in a
[1:36:05] realm to where he can
[1:36:07] get to have confidence in
[1:36:11] them I surely ain't going to say that
[1:36:13] that the devil made me do
[1:36:15] it I don't even say the devil made me do
[1:36:18] it when I do
[1:36:20] wrong well that's what it is devil made
[1:36:23] me do no you're trying to prop up an
[1:36:25] excuse you flim flamy around admit it
[1:36:28] you're the one that done
[1:36:33] it devil made me cut my hair and God
[1:36:36] knows I just cried while them scissors
[1:36:39] were going through it I just
[1:36:42] cried oh
[1:36:46] yeah you cried cuz you going to get
[1:36:49] caught up with cuz when you walked
[1:36:50] outside somebody going to say oh you cut
[1:36:52] your
[1:36:54] hair
[1:36:58] right what gets most Crooks caught
[1:37:01] because they got a soul they got to
[1:37:03] admit to somebody else they want because
[1:37:04] they don't want to live by their
[1:37:06] s and they admit to somebody else and
[1:37:08] they get
[1:37:10] caught it's all on
[1:37:13] blabbering you said what does that got
[1:37:14] to do with
[1:37:18] faith how back could
[1:37:22] a man would live by his own
[1:37:26] faith so taking this lower form of
[1:37:30] that right men attitude is this the way
[1:37:33] the prophet said it right menly attitude
[1:37:36] toward any promise will bring it to
[1:37:39] pass now what's the right menal
[1:37:43] attitude well now Lord I want you to
[1:37:46] know that I haven't done anything wrong
[1:37:48] this week I haven't lied I haven't
[1:37:50] cheated and that fell standing over
[1:37:52] beside of me he's been a dirty dog but I
[1:37:54] ain't been like it is that in the
[1:37:56] Bible am I in the Bible with the you
[1:37:59] know the man saying that Lord I've
[1:38:01] fasted I've done this but I ain't been
[1:38:03] like that sinner over
[1:38:05] there are you with
[1:38:08] me but what was the rest of the
[1:38:10] story the man that was repented in his
[1:38:13] heart went home Justified you know what
[1:38:15] the other man went home feeling
[1:38:18] Justified that's right well I read told
[1:38:21] the Lord how good I've
[1:38:24] been and he agreed with me yeah wasn't
[1:38:28] that what Tammy F said she said I asked
[1:38:31] God about putting on makeup said he
[1:38:34] never did tell me it
[1:38:41] wrong we're nice ain't we're good
[1:38:44] people but what's
[1:38:48] faith it ain't just an imagination or
[1:38:52] thought is something you actually
[1:38:57] possess that nobody can't talk you out
[1:38:59] of
[1:39:03] it
[1:39:05] now I mean I'm 74 years old I was born
[1:39:09] 1940 got goofed up on what day I was
[1:39:12] born on but they finally got that right
[1:39:15] but the point is I was born and you know
[1:39:19] you can't talk me out of that
[1:39:23] there's not much need to you trying
[1:39:25] yeah you
[1:39:32] know but what about it being so real to
[1:39:38] you come on have you ever had God to
[1:39:42] just be so real to
[1:39:44] you I've
[1:39:47] walked when I knew he was walking beside
[1:39:49] of me and I could feel his
[1:39:52] presence I'm a very emotional person but
[1:39:55] only emotional to
[1:39:57] myself you're not with me all the time
[1:40:00] I've walked when I felt his
[1:40:03] presence and I've stopped look
[1:40:08] around I've seen him I had no problem
[1:40:11] I've smelt the presence of the
[1:40:13] Lord down in the woods when I was deer
[1:40:16] hunting when there was no females with
[1:40:18] 100 m i mean 10 Mile there the prettiest
[1:40:21] perfume you've ever
[1:40:23] done ever
[1:40:26] smelled and yet at the same time he was
[1:40:29] bringing to pass what I had asked him to
[1:40:32] do but I didn't understand it and I was
[1:40:34] laying on the ground crying as a py
[1:40:37] paded little child and saying God now
[1:40:40] even some crazy female is out here I
[1:40:43] can't even deer
[1:40:44] hunt without these crazy females with
[1:40:47] their
[1:40:49] perfume
[1:40:51] brother Dale you mean you're honest to
[1:40:52] tell us yeah then about an hour later I
[1:40:55] found out he was working out his will in
[1:40:58] somebody's
[1:41:03] life but you see we think we have a
[1:41:06] great super duper
[1:41:10] Faith but you know God has to put us
[1:41:13] through the test to find out remember
[1:41:15] how we started out talking the other day
[1:41:18] God doesn't tempt Satan tempts God Tak
[1:41:20] yes there's a lot of difference in it
[1:41:22] too sounds like the same word and it
[1:41:24] reads basically the same word but
[1:41:26] there's a lot of difference in it Satan
[1:41:28] tempts you he'll put out in front of you
[1:41:32] an
[1:41:33] object that will throw you the wrong way
[1:41:37] if you used to drink he'll put you in a
[1:41:38] drunken crowd used to smoke he'll put
[1:41:41] you
[1:41:42] there but God test God don't send you to
[1:41:46] an
[1:41:47] alcoholic he don't send you into a bar
[1:41:53] no he just simply allows test and we
[1:41:56] listen to T the other night and brother
[1:41:57] R said God only test
[1:42:00] You by his
[1:42:06] word well I've been through his test God
[1:42:08] put a test in front of me and I failed
[1:42:10] it no we just got in the garbage can
[1:42:13] ourselves and blaming God for
[1:42:15] it
[1:42:17] right we got in trouble blaming him
[1:42:22] he doesn't tempt he tests Us by his word
[1:42:28] amen he don't put something in front of
[1:42:31] you to try to get trap you with
[1:42:35] it you said well what did that get out
[1:42:38] the world got out there to do
[1:42:42] that don't blame
[1:42:45] God my brother tell you know her he's a
[1:42:47] Methodist preacher he said God can't
[1:42:49] judge me for being wrong he made me me
[1:42:53] wrong I said you didn't God didn't make
[1:42:56] you wrong you made yourself wrong he
[1:42:58] said well God made good and evil I said
[1:43:00] no you're
[1:43:03] misinterpreting he knows of evil he
[1:43:05] didn't make
[1:43:07] evil said even though you quote your
[1:43:09] scripture correctly you're not quoting
[1:43:11] God God can't make wrong and in judge it
[1:43:15] for being wrong
[1:43:17] right but he can permit it yeah that's
[1:43:21] right talking to somebody the other day
[1:43:23] about the you remember the old the young
[1:43:26] Prophet that went down he was told don't
[1:43:28] you go back the wrong way don't eat with
[1:43:30] them or
[1:43:31] nothing old Prophet went down told
[1:43:36] him lied to him right and told him said
[1:43:39] God told me to tell you come on back I'm
[1:43:42] a prophet and you're a
[1:43:45] prophet he went back with the old
[1:43:47] prophet and while he was eating the old
[1:43:50] Prophet wrote rose up and
[1:43:52] said you're
[1:43:55] dead but I want to ask you a
[1:43:57] question what did God do to the old
[1:44:00] Prophet for
[1:44:06] lying God permitted him to do it
[1:44:12] right did God judge the old Prophet so
[1:44:16] you can't play with
[1:44:18] prophets prophets were ordained of God
[1:44:21] and you don't play with them why did God
[1:44:24] in the Bible tell a prophet to go marry
[1:44:27] a prostitute and have children by which
[1:44:29] was contrary to the word now you explain
[1:44:35] that see we've got all our reasoning
[1:44:38] factors that we know all about things
[1:44:41] you can't reason God's
[1:44:43] word you got to believe
[1:44:46] it because faith is the substance
[1:44:51] let's go all the way back to where God
[1:44:52] is and let
[1:44:54] him then come down to us and speak to
[1:44:58] our
[1:45:00] heart and once he speaks to you you
[1:45:03] won't have to worry about
[1:45:06] it and you know what he don't explain a
[1:45:08] lot of it you ever notice
[1:45:12] that I've heard a brother one time he's
[1:45:14] talking about the Lord told me to do
[1:45:16] this and I told him I was going to do
[1:45:17] that and the Lord told me to do this he
[1:45:18] said I argued with him for the longest
[1:45:20] said I've finally done what he said for
[1:45:22] me to do and I caught a bunch of
[1:45:28] fish I mean I just simply didn't believe
[1:45:33] him cuz you don't argue with God right
[1:45:37] he'll simply come down and tell you
[1:45:39] something these preachers can tell you
[1:45:41] in a hurry what I'm fixing to say you'll
[1:45:44] give you one thought and you one word
[1:45:47] and you'll preach for five years off of
[1:45:49] it
[1:45:51] over what he give you as one word
[1:45:55] right see we're not dealing with a
[1:45:57] peanut brain something like us as human
[1:46:00] beings we can't blame God we can't do
[1:46:02] this that or the
[1:46:06] other and let's don't call it what it is
[1:46:08] or what it
[1:46:11] ain't if it's an actual substance is to
[1:46:14] Gil we will eventually walk on that
[1:46:16] substance I may not be able to step out
[1:46:19] here like that but I will not argue that
[1:46:21] Ben hen didn't do it and I don't believe
[1:46:24] he's in this
[1:46:26] message I'm just honest
[1:46:29] now but you know what he reached a
[1:46:33] place just like a firew walker can walk
[1:46:36] across fire and never be burned he
[1:46:39] reached a
[1:46:43] place but see I'm not trying to do that
[1:46:47] there's the
[1:46:48] difference I have no desire to walk walk
[1:46:50] on CS to prove that I have the faith of
[1:46:57] God I try to keep preaching what's in
[1:47:00] here then if you can't see it's the word
[1:47:02] of God then that's your
[1:47:04] problem because we will finally get to
[1:47:06] it where the Prophet
[1:47:08] says
[1:47:12] faith is a six
[1:47:19] sense and only Born Again Believers have
[1:47:22] it you say what you going to do about
[1:47:24] the people with the healing I just got
[1:47:26] through explaining
[1:47:27] that healing for that is not based on
[1:47:34] salvation only a born again believer has
[1:47:36] that sick
[1:47:39] sense to be able to go beyond all of our
[1:47:42] senses and still believe
[1:47:46] God come on Brothers what do you think
[1:47:48] about it substance Faith the prophet
[1:47:52] called it perfect Faith substance
[1:47:55] Faith your mental
[1:47:58] Faith becomes a spiritual
[1:48:00] Revelation and when it does it becomes a
[1:48:03] substance until then it's not a
[1:48:05] substance it's only a mental Faith a
[1:48:09] concept a
[1:48:12] thought and a man stand in B metal with
[1:48:15] is just his brain
[1:48:19] capacity break
[1:48:22] life just with his mental
[1:48:27] abilities no wonder the prophet said
[1:48:29] biggest portion of our faith is
[1:48:31] mental but you know mental faith comes
[1:48:33] by hearing the word of
[1:48:35] God but there's a quote I've got it in
[1:48:37] here you know that hearing the word of
[1:48:39] God is Not
[1:48:42] Faith that's where I love to just keep
[1:48:44] reading what the prophet has to
[1:48:46] say cuz somewhere you wind up with these
[1:48:49] little beautiful nuggets
[1:48:52] hearing the word of God is Not
[1:48:57] Faith it's when it's
[1:49:00] revealed so you can say this is the word
[1:49:02] of
[1:49:08] God brother R said as long as it's
[1:49:11] laying in the pages of this book it can
[1:49:14] be
[1:49:15] questioned that's what he said but he
[1:49:18] said when it comes off of there it comes
[1:49:19] in your
[1:49:20] heart see then you got the
[1:49:24] faith you got a
[1:49:27] substance I thought we believe the new
[1:49:30] birth was the person of Jesus
[1:49:35] Christ are you listening I thought we
[1:49:38] believe the new birth no I thought it
[1:49:40] was shouting speaking in tongue
[1:49:41] believing the
[1:49:43] message I thought the prophet said it
[1:49:45] was the person of Jesus Christ coming
[1:49:48] living in you
[1:49:51] you know if it's a person of Jesus
[1:49:53] Christ then you have a substance living
[1:49:55] in you right that's
[1:49:58] it the person of Jesus Christ Living in
[1:50:05] you that's why you can't show it to
[1:50:07] nobody
[1:50:08] else he's your God and God
[1:50:14] alone I've always made this statement
[1:50:16] and I don't mean it incorrect mean it

[1:50:24] god when it's my God it's my

[1:50:33] same father as long as we line up
[1:50:34] correctly then that way brother col and
