[41:17] father we know you sent your word so now
[41:19] the healing has got to be there in the
[41:20] virture to follow have your way with us
[41:23] now as we read your word you come and
[41:25] speak to us in Jesus name
[41:31] amen so we'll go to
[41:35] Matthew
[41:37] 1336 remember you go back over um in the
[41:41] beginning of Matthew and it'll be the uh
[41:44] the second mystery then this is the
[41:45] mystery explained so it's reason we're
[41:47] going that way then Jesus sent the
[41:50] multitude away and went into the house
[41:52] and his disciples came unto him saying
[41:54] declare unto us the parable of the terrs
[41:56] of the field
[41:57] he answered and said unto them he that
[42:00] sth the good seed is the son of man the
[42:03] field is the world the good seed are the
[42:06] children of the Kingdom but the tires
[42:09] are the children of the wicked
[42:12] one the enemy that sowed them is the
[42:15] devil the Harvest is the end of the
[42:18] world and the reapers are the Angels and
[42:21] therefore the tires are gathered and
[42:23] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[42:26] end of of this world the son of man
[42:29] shall send forth his angels and they
[42:32] Shall Gather out of his kingdom all
[42:34] things that offend and them which do
[42:37] iniquity now
[42:39] notice the angels from the son of man
[42:42] will what gather out of his kingdom
[42:46] you're going to they're going to drive
[42:47] them out of
[42:48] it uh you know and shall cast them into
[42:52] a furnace of fire there shall be weeping
[42:55] and nashing of teeth then shall the
[42:57] righteous shine forth as the son in the
[43:00] Kingdom of their father who hath an ear
[43:03] to hear Let Him hear now let's go over
[43:06] to Luke and just read the one we were
[43:08] reading this morning the one verse 24
[43:10] Luke
[43:12] 21:24 they shall fall by the edge of the
[43:14] sword and shall be led away captivity
[43:18] into all nations and we know that
[43:20] happened back under you know woe unto
[43:22] them that are with child and Gil suck
[43:25] and all that was back there and and
[43:27] Titus coming forth in
[43:29] ad70 and surrounding Jerusalem and then
[43:35] what and Jerusalem shall be troden down
[43:38] of the Gentiles until the time of the
[43:40] Gentiles be finished you may be seated
[43:43] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[43:46] of the
[43:47] word now not to back up a lot but for
[43:51] those who maybe won't
[43:54] hear uh this morning to make sure that
[43:58] they know kind of what we're talking
[43:59] about and to get our minds into the
[44:02] right channel because that's what we
[44:05] want uh we're talking about this morning
[44:08] and we'll keep the same title this
[44:10] afternoon we'll stay with the title of
[44:15] dispensations and uh we read here in
[44:17] Luke that it says in the
[44:19] time of the Gentiles the prophet used it
[44:23] and said in the dispensation of the
[44:26] Gentiles so then that was my point was
[44:28] trying to get us to this morning to look
[44:30] at it that dispensation deals with a
[44:33] time wise that we're looking at or you
[44:36] know what's taking place in in the day
[44:39] and uh dispensation more or less refers
[44:43] to like a stewardships or something like
[44:45] that is the natural word or even pulling
[44:48] from the Greek and it doesn't give I
[44:51] believe the true meaning of what we need
[44:53] to
[44:54] see but I you know I'm not trying trying
[44:57] to change anything I'm trying to speak
[45:00] of what is there in the word that it is
[45:03] the time of the
[45:04] Gentiles the dispensation or the times
[45:07] and I'm trying to get our point to
[45:08] looking at
[45:10] times and not looking at something that
[45:12] what would not fit together with all of
[45:15] the word of God and uh that way see it's
[45:19] all got to fit because the Bible can't
[45:22] as I said this morning you can't see if
[45:25] you say well brother brand said
[45:27] uh we had a dispensation of the Old
[45:29] Testament dispensation of the new
[45:30] dispensation of the law dispensation of
[45:33] Grace and uh that's true we believe that
[45:37] but remember he goes on to say then I'm
[45:40] not much on a dispensationalist after
[45:42] he'd said he was well if you asked me
[45:45] today you'd say brother Dale are you a
[45:47] dispensation I said yeah according to my
[45:49] understanding of
[45:52] dispensations but maybe according to a
[45:54] lot of people's understanding of that I
[45:57] would not be one because I believe it's
[45:59] the same God in the Old Testament is
[46:02] revealed in the New
[46:04] Testament all right it's not two
[46:07] different gods it's the same God all
[46:10] right you'd say well now if the Old
[46:12] Testament reveals one dispensation and
[46:14] you say well that's a dispensation of a
[46:17] father and you know that being one God
[46:20] and then the New Testament being a
[46:22] dispensation of the sun it being a
[46:25] different God then I'm not not a
[46:27] dispensationalist
[46:28] either I believe that's the former idea
[46:31] of the point that he was saying when he
[46:33] said I'm not on that but he went on to
[46:35] say the quotes I gave you the three he
[46:37] said the Gentile dispensation right in
[46:40] the same quote Parts you know so my
[46:42] point is uh I believe in one true and
[46:46] living God revealed throughout the
[46:50] entire word of
[46:52] God all right now I believe that the
[46:55] revealing of God
[46:59] was not complete now take my wording and
[47:02] listen or finished even in Jesus
[47:07] Christ and even though he was the
[47:09] fullness of the godhead
[47:11] bodily all right and he was the son of
[47:14] man amen but that was not the completion
[47:16] of it right all right because there is a
[47:20] bride to be revealed that's right and
[47:23] the prophet said she's part of the
[47:25] mystery that's right
[47:28] and must be revealed all right now I
[47:30] believe that's Christ of Myster I'll get
[47:32] back to those points later
[47:34] but see I believe that it's the same God
[47:37] being revealed all the way through and I
[47:39] believe like in the ages then that it's
[47:43] uh not him revealing himself in one age
[47:45] is something and the other age is
[47:48] something else the ages is the revealing
[47:52] of God to us of the part that was not
[47:57] made known back there in human flesh as
[48:00] he was walking the Earth he was the
[48:02] fullness of the godhead bodily yeah but
[48:04] we had to be in him all right so we're
[48:07] not something
[48:08] added that would be a dispensation like
[48:11] mankind is looking at as something here
[48:14] and something here different no we are
[48:16] not anything different we are him made
[48:20] manifest in a many membered body whereas
[48:22] it was once in one body see now we are
[48:26] the body
[48:27] of God upon the Earth and he's revealing
[48:32] himself in the way that is to be done
[48:35] all right we'll cover in a little bit
[48:37] that down through the church ages he was
[48:40] revealing himself as Son of God Amen all
[48:43] right then in the end time he'd be
[48:45] revealing himself as son of man all
[48:48] right now I want you to watch this real
[48:51] careful in a minute I'll say it and then
[48:53] repeat it cuz I want you to follow the
[48:56] line
[48:58] and I remember in my early years of
[49:00] studying it and uh we had an old battery
[49:03] ped tape player uh for the 7 Minutes
[49:06] real recorder you know thing that we we
[49:10] carried to work and back and we'd listen
[49:12] to R around preaching as we'd go to work
[49:14] you know and coming back and we would uh
[49:18] it was a battery pirate and we didn't
[49:20] all those have hookups in the car you
[49:23] know so in the old days so we'd have to
[49:26] uh run batteries and I have sat there
[49:29] because itd have enough battery to keep
[49:30] the voice I've sat there with a pencil
[49:32] and actually turned the
[49:34] thing halfway home cuz I was that
[49:38] interested in hearing you know I turn it
[49:41] myself make it go and the rest of it you
[49:44] know because I wanted to hear and I
[49:46] remember we we hit something I've
[49:48] mentioned this before to you but we were
[49:51] playing and we'd always just choose you
[49:53] know like I choose one day brother Mo
[49:55] would one day brother Holland one
[49:56] brother
[49:58] LS and for some reason one week we never
[50:01] any of us chose but one tape we had the
[50:03] unveiling of
[50:05] God and uh so we played that for 5 days
[50:10] you know it just went that way we just
[50:12] didn't bring another one well you know
[50:14] about the fourth day I really caught
[50:16] what he was
[50:18] saying and uh you know it it really
[50:21] dawned on me the point that he was
[50:23] making and it cleared up the Scriptures
[50:26] it cleared up a lot of things uh to me
[50:29] as to my understanding of the one true
[50:32] and living
[50:34] God now we'll read this in a minute so
[50:36] then we'll go back through it but see
[50:38] he's revealed as three sons name right
[50:41] son of man Son of God Son of
[50:44] David all
[50:46] right but see if you don't see it in the
[50:49] correct order look what you'd be
[50:53] going and then when we would cover that
[50:56] son of man
[50:57] man was there Prophet dying giving his
[51:00] life come forth Son of God in the ages
[51:04] then you'd be looking at the next thing
[51:05] to be would be son of
[51:07] David you'd be totally out of the
[51:09] scriptures that's right you know even
[51:12] though you're quoting identically
[51:15] because there's only three sons names
[51:17] the Son of God or son of man Son of God
[51:20] Son of David all right but you got a
[51:24] little key in there that you got to
[51:26] understand
[51:28] and we'll read it in a minute but see
[51:29] then it just clicked when he said it one
[51:32] day see then he son of man
[51:36] Prophet God himself in human flesh come
[51:38] to
[51:40] die died son of man Rose Son of God come
[51:43] forth the church ages Son of
[51:46] God in the end time he comes back as son
[51:49] of
[51:50] man and then he'll go to to Israel as
[51:53] son of David right
[51:56] and see then the
[51:58] scriptures beautifully
[52:01] fit the things that he was trying to
[52:04] explain begin to
[52:06] unfold as it did then that's where I
[52:09] preached that the bride would be there
[52:11] in 1969 that the bride would be the son
[52:15] of man in the last days all right and uh
[52:20] because you think about it look how you
[52:23] would mess up your
[52:24] scriptures son of man his Prophet as
[52:27] we'll review these in a minute cuz I
[52:28] want you to let him say it I'm saying it
[52:31] and getting your thought in your mind
[52:33] that he was son of man and he died it
[52:35] was prophet son of
[52:37] man cuz you couldn't kill Son of
[52:40] God there was no way see that that the
[52:42] Son of God at Calvary had to exit out of
[52:45] the body or the spirit of God the very
[52:49] life of God had to exit out of the body
[52:51] all right then on the day of Pentecost
[52:53] the Holy Ghost could come back the and
[52:55] be son of God Through the Ages but if
[52:58] you went right straight on the son of
[52:59] David how are you going to get
[53:02] there you can't go and I thought how
[53:05] many of us has missed
[53:08] that and knowing this all these years
[53:10] and tried my best to preach it unto you
[53:13] you know it surely gets more interesting
[53:16] every day you can't go from Son of God
[53:19] to son of David that's
[53:22] right you got to come back to a human
[53:25] element wise
[53:28] you know you got to come back to that
[53:31] son of man so I'm saying this if you
[53:33] miss the message you know at least what
[53:35] I'm trying to
[53:36] say it's got to be then that Luke 17:30
[53:40] would come into line and and it would be
[53:42] falling into place and see then once he
[53:44] comes in fully into bride and son of man
[53:48] he can go right on to Israel that's
[53:51] right amen but you know what he'll start
[53:53] off to
[53:54] Israel son of God
[53:57] right New Birth or what you want to call
[54:00] it for them not in the Kingdom but
[54:02] eternal
[54:03] life you don't have to die again to give
[54:06] it to them but he'll give them the Holy
[54:08] Ghost then they'll see through those two
[54:11] prophets the son of
[54:14] man right and then they will see and
[54:18] realize that he is now son of David to
[54:21] them that's right all right we'll read a
[54:23] quote here in just a minute where
[54:24] brother R said he's the son of David to
[54:27] us
[54:31] now I love them little things it's laid
[54:34] in there and then it makes me
[54:38] Ponder consider what is being said you
[54:42] know cuz you
[54:43] see he's revealed to you and I as son of
[54:47] man Son of God and Son of David amen he
[54:51] reveals himself to his bride while she's
[54:53] here living all the manifestations that
[54:56] he'll ever be to anyone is made known to
[55:00] her yes sir so he's the son of David in
[55:05] my Revelation but yet he's the son of
[55:07] man yet he's the son of God CU it's the
[55:10] same God that's right and his name is
[55:13] the Lord Jesus Christ all right so if
[55:15] you miss the message now you'll know
[55:18] that's what I'm talking about so we'll
[55:19] let him let him do the reading all right
[55:22] now watch as we go through
[55:24] it and watch watch this to point that we
[55:27] were talking about
[55:28] dispensations because then he's going to
[55:30] be the dispensation of the son of
[55:33] man and we'll let the prophet read it to
[55:36] you that where he say he he couldn't be
[55:39] the Son of
[55:43] God now that don't mean he's not Son of
[55:47] God he was born son of God right right
[55:51] and there's a quote in there where the
[55:53] Prophet you know because he he just time
[55:55] after time he says
[55:57] that he never revealed himself as Son of
[56:00] God see he never called himself Son of
[56:02] God he never referred to himself as Son
[56:04] of
[56:06] God that he referred to himself as son
[56:08] of
[56:10] man but see he was
[56:13] born the Son of
[56:16] God because that's God in human
[56:20] flesh and he growed in Grace and
[56:24] knowledge because
[56:27] he was born
[56:30] Emmanuel but
[56:32] then he never mentioned son of
[56:36] man until he enters his
[56:41] ministry then he begins to talk about
[56:44] son of
[56:45] man and isn't it odd how that as I've
[56:48] always said to you that none of the
[56:50] scholars caught it Scofield's got some
[56:52] good points about it
[56:57] even Paul Peter and them didn't write
[56:59] about son of
[57:02] man but then when brother R starts out
[57:05] in his
[57:06] ministry just immediately when he enters
[57:09] his ministry as to preaching he starts
[57:12] talking about the son of man that's no
[57:15] coincidence to me that's exactly what
[57:18] it's supposed to be all right
[57:20] now we've quoted this many times to you
[57:24] the prophet of God said when the bride
[57:27] realizes who she
[57:29] is and what she's here
[57:32] for he said Satan will be powerless
[57:36] before
[57:38] her do you think Satan could handle or
[57:41] could now let me quote it and get it
[57:43] straight where brother R said none of us
[57:45] is a match for the devil no no no Luther
[57:48] wasn't a match for the devil no way but
[57:51] yet when God revealed that just shall
[57:54] live by faith Satan would know match for
[57:56] that
[57:57] message they came forth in Martin
[58:00] Luther they said Martin Luther don't you
[58:03] know the world is against you he said I
[58:05] want them to know that I'm against
[58:08] them see nothing could tackle that
[58:12] message they could pick on the
[58:15] man and look what they're doing now
[58:18] nobody can tackle this message or the
[58:19] hour that has been given unto
[58:22] us but look what even inward ranks are
[58:27] coming forth and now they would not have
[58:29] Dar said a word while he was alive but
[58:32] now they're running forth with their own
[58:36] messages well you know what I believe
[58:38] they're doing they're running without a
[58:40] message because they run out of this
[58:43] message into their own all right but
[58:47] think about it now and just watch the
[58:49] point and remember when we read it that
[58:52] he never referred to himself as son of
[58:54] man because that was not his office at
[58:57] the
[58:58] time that was not his
[59:02] dispensational of revealing
[59:06] himself and then he even goes to Peter
[59:09] you know who do Man say I the son of man
[59:13] am and Peter
[59:15] said thou aren't the
[59:18] Christ the son of the Living God he
[59:20] never said Peter now hold it hold hold
[59:22] it I'm not the Son of God now let me
[59:23] tell you I'm going straighten you out
[59:24] you know no no cuz he knew that's all
[59:29] they could
[59:30] handle so he said Peter you didn't
[59:33] answer my
[59:35] question cuz you don't understand son of
[59:39] man but said you got the right point
[59:42] that I'm the Son of God and upon that
[59:46] Revelation I'll build my
[59:50] church on the revelation of Son of
[59:54] God but said in the end time I'm going
[59:56] to come
[59:58] back in the day when the son of man is
[1:00:00] to be revealed you know all
[1:00:04] right think on these things see then
[1:00:07] that way I'm not a
[1:00:10] dispensationalist to believe in changing
[1:00:13] of gods or changing of and I believe
[1:00:16] every Church age there was God made
[1:00:18] manifest for the age they were in that's
[1:00:21] right all right but I believe he puts it
[1:00:23] all in the end and not giving us
[1:00:26] anything any
[1:00:28] different because I believe what Luther
[1:00:31] taught I believe what Wesley taught I
[1:00:34] believe the truth of what they taught I
[1:00:36] believe what the Baptist taught the
[1:00:38] Presbyterian taught the Pentecostals
[1:00:41] taught I believe the truth of it because
[1:00:44] it's part of God's
[1:00:45] word all right and see that way I'm not
[1:00:48] rejecting
[1:00:51] anything I'm not an isolationist or what
[1:00:54] you'd call it or you're just a a
[1:00:56] brandom no if anything I guess we Lula
[1:01:01] ites we just that's what I believe that
[1:01:05] we're trying to be what God wants us to
[1:01:08] be for the hour we're in okay now watch
[1:01:11] as he begins to as it begins to unfold
[1:01:15] and and you'll see the pattern coming
[1:01:18] down and the dispensations will fall
[1:01:21] into place or the times or the revealing
[1:01:25] will fall into the place to where we can
[1:01:27] see it so go ahead
[1:01:28] brother Joe I guess who's back our da
[1:01:33] Bob and Joe I guess other day I was
[1:01:35] looking around
[1:01:37] I I said they must have this thing on
[1:01:42] automatic all right look what he says I
[1:01:44] wish you would listen to the unveiling
[1:01:47] of
[1:01:48] God the Mighty God
[1:01:51] unveiled especially those two messages
[1:01:56] and study
[1:01:57] them and then like I said you'll see
[1:02:00] there's words in there that'll if you'll
[1:02:03] really study what he's
[1:02:05] saying and then when you do you'll see
[1:02:07] something and it'll just open up the
[1:02:09] beautiful picture of the Plan of
[1:02:11] Redemption from God all right now watch
[1:02:14] he came in three names three sons name
[1:02:18] he came in the son name of the son of of
[1:02:21] man the son of David and the Son of God
[1:02:25] now he didn't put in
[1:02:28] order but yet we know the order because
[1:02:31] he puts you know the messages he put
[1:02:33] them in order then he explains it now
[1:02:36] now he came first in the son of he
[1:02:38] started to say David and or whatever cuz
[1:02:40] they put the point there he said Son of
[1:02:43] Man so he came first as son of man
[1:02:46] because he was a
[1:02:48] prophet now Jehovah himself called
[1:02:50] Ezekiel and the prophets son of man what
[1:02:54] see us thou you know son of man
[1:02:56] man Jesus never referred to himself as
[1:02:59] Son of God he referred to himself as son
[1:03:02] of man because the scriptures cannot be
[1:03:06] broken right now look how specific a
[1:03:10] prophet with no
[1:03:12] education could talk it baffles
[1:03:16] me cuz maybe you don't follow it the way
[1:03:19] I do and I maybe that's good that you
[1:03:21] don't but look he never referred to
[1:03:24] himself as Son of God he never referred
[1:03:27] to himself as Son of
[1:03:31] God he didn't say that didn't right that
[1:03:33] he was the son of
[1:03:36] God look how perfect maybe you don't
[1:03:40] follow scripture like that I mean those
[1:03:42] things mean great to me the Bible could
[1:03:45] call him a Son of God when he was
[1:03:48] born the Bible can put him in the
[1:03:50] lineage and call him a Son of
[1:03:53] God right we says
[1:03:58] he see Jesus never referred to himself
[1:04:02] as Son of
[1:04:04] God how perfect the being it is he
[1:04:08] referred to himself as son of man
[1:04:11] because his scriptures cannot be broken
[1:04:13] all right going to the next that was
[1:04:15] paragraph
[1:04:17] 60 this is paragraph 68 same message
[1:04:21] unveiling of god notice he came first as
[1:04:24] the prophet and they crucified him his
[1:04:28] own crucified him he came as the son of
[1:04:31] man then after the Holy Spirit came he
[1:04:34] was then the Son of God God is a
[1:04:38] spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God
[1:04:41] he lived through the church ages as Son
[1:04:44] of God watch you now in the Millennium
[1:04:48] he' be son of David sitting on the
[1:04:49] throne of his father
[1:04:51] David he is the son of David now
[1:04:57] he is to you and I and he is the son of
[1:05:00] David he just wouldn't making itself
[1:05:02] manifest to them he was the son of
[1:05:06] David but you know he didn't change Gods
[1:05:09] he was the same God what I tried with
[1:05:11] all this about dispensation to get you
[1:05:13] to look at it there he stood Son of God
[1:05:15] Son of Man son of David standing on
[1:05:17] Earth that's right that's right but he
[1:05:20] was not making himself known in that way
[1:05:24] right he was making himself known as son
[1:05:26] of
[1:05:27] man because you can't kill God which
[1:05:30] would be the Son of God and you
[1:05:32] certainly can't kill the son of
[1:05:36] David so he had to come as a human
[1:05:40] man to release that life that was within
[1:05:44] him
[1:05:45] right that's why he's called son of man
[1:05:47] see watch it but look at the point this
[1:05:51] is what caught me at listening see he's
[1:05:54] the son of David's sitting upon the
[1:05:56] throne of his father and remember
[1:05:59] between the Son of God and he just kind
[1:06:02] of
[1:06:04] stops in the lady you see an age they
[1:06:08] put him out
[1:06:12] who and be real careful with
[1:06:17] me they rejected this
[1:06:20] message and Le
[1:06:23] Yia and they put brother brandom out
[1:06:26] because he start out preaching to
[1:06:28] 400,000 went up preaching to 30 y you
[1:06:32] know 30 people or something or
[1:06:34] less and see they turned him
[1:06:37] out and just like it was to
[1:06:40] Samuel when God said they haven't
[1:06:42] rejected you Samuel they've rejected me
[1:06:46] they wanted
[1:06:49] Samuel and the organizational systems of
[1:06:52] this world wanted the great prophet of
[1:06:55] this day to come and have healing
[1:06:58] campaigns right one thing was to draw
[1:07:02] money for their own benefit but yet it
[1:07:05] was to benefit the people of healings
[1:07:07] and great things but when he begin to
[1:07:12] preach right and what did he say when
[1:07:15] you begin to say I and my father are one
[1:07:18] all right so then look at what it's
[1:07:20] doing now I want to I want to be slow if
[1:07:22] I have to real
[1:07:24] slow I want you to get
[1:07:27] this I've got notes written now that
[1:07:29] would take if I preach it four more
[1:07:31] sermons and I've never been that far
[1:07:35] ahead I hadn't I've never been that far
[1:07:38] ahead in 40 something years of
[1:07:41] preaching remember the son of David and
[1:07:44] the ladies in church a a Son of God
[1:07:46] excuse
[1:07:47] me they put him
[1:07:49] out he said but brother Dale they didn't
[1:07:52] put out the Holy
[1:07:54] Spirit no like not wanting
[1:07:57] it they want it to be there to the Great
[1:08:00] Signs and the
[1:08:02] Wonders but they don't want the
[1:08:05] word that is related to the holy
[1:08:09] spirit so you see what they're putting
[1:08:11] out you return down the word you
[1:08:13] automatically turn down the spirit and
[1:08:15] you can holler and scream all you want
[1:08:17] to I got the Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost
[1:08:21] right and you dress and act and do like
[1:08:24] the world now don't tell me too
[1:08:28] late
[1:08:30] right see in that way you can say I love
[1:08:32] the
[1:08:35] word but it's only up to a certain
[1:08:38] degree right so father what we're going
[1:08:43] through and in Luke watch look at the
[1:08:46] point they put him
[1:08:49] out they put the Holy Spirit out of the
[1:08:51] church you remember Wade Wednesday night
[1:08:53] and what he was bringing remember what
[1:08:55] brother Brown said that the Holy Ghost
[1:08:58] has been bound for 2,000 years at the
[1:09:01] door of Creeds and dogmas that's right
[1:09:05] but to be loosed in the end time
[1:09:09] by the last Angel's message right
[1:09:14] right so the Holy Ghost even in the
[1:09:16] Great Book of
[1:09:18] Acts you look right over it and there it
[1:09:20] was right in the church beginning to
[1:09:22] fall away right right see then the Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost never really been
[1:09:27] loosed for 2,000 years that's be back
[1:09:29] before Cal that's back before it
[1:09:33] came
[1:09:36] right you get the point the Holy Ghost
[1:09:38] has never worked the way he wanted to
[1:09:41] work
[1:09:44] right but it's to do that in the end
[1:09:47] time but
[1:09:49] look the let you see in age they put him
[1:09:52] out now son of God
[1:09:57] so look like he should have been saing
[1:10:00] and next he revealed himself as son of
[1:10:02] David that's supposed to be the next in
[1:10:05] line isn't
[1:10:07] it son of man Son of God Son of
[1:10:11] David 1 2
[1:10:13] 3 well look son of man Son of God Son of
[1:10:19] Man son of
[1:10:21] David and just in case some of you out
[1:10:24] there are so smart that you think four
[1:10:27] is an antichrist number I happen to know
[1:10:30] that
[1:10:31] is white black red pale but I happen to
[1:10:35] know that four is a restoration number
[1:10:39] right that's right justification
[1:10:40] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] and then the word that's right amen
[1:10:46] right so then we think we're so well I
[1:10:48] just cut him all CU he don't even
[1:10:50] understand
[1:10:53] for you got to pull
[1:10:56] Pit All I want is to ask you a
[1:10:59] question how can you go from Son of God
[1:11:02] to son of
[1:11:07] David to go to son of David you got to
[1:11:09] come back to earth that's
[1:11:11] something right so watch him and in Luke
[1:11:15] now he's put out of the lady of sin age
[1:11:17] Son of God and in Luke he said he'll be
[1:11:21] revealed as son of the as son of man the
[1:11:25] proph
[1:11:26] it come on fulfilling the rest of
[1:11:30] it see the scriptures TI perfectly
[1:11:33] together son of man Son of God Son of
[1:11:39] David the Myster is hidden right there
[1:11:41] in a few words that's right it is to
[1:11:45] come back from Son of God Through the
[1:11:47] Ages and the end time is to come as the
[1:11:49] son of man a great mystery that's right
[1:11:53] but yet everybody knows all about the
[1:11:54] prophet it
[1:11:56] came
[1:11:58] amen thank
[1:12:02] God but remember the prophet is just
[1:12:06] like
[1:12:08] Luther Luther preached the message of
[1:12:10] the just shall live by faith but the
[1:12:12] Catholic Church never got scared of him
[1:12:15] right it was when the people began to
[1:12:18] believe the message Satan wouldn't have
[1:12:21] scared of brother random he couldn't
[1:12:22] tackle him he knew better to try it
[1:12:27] but yet when he passed off look what
[1:12:29] he've done they've attacked his message
[1:12:31] from every form of could be thought of
[1:12:33] that's
[1:12:35] right that's
[1:12:39] right but
[1:12:41] look the scriptures tie perfectly
[1:12:43] together son of man Son of God Son of
[1:12:45] David what was it it's the same God all
[1:12:48] the time just changing his form in
[1:12:52] morphe right he just changing it it's a
[1:12:56] great drama to him he is acting it out
[1:13:00] amen that's
[1:13:02] right displaying himself as son of man
[1:13:06] the prophet God to come and
[1:13:12] die right can't kill Son of God can't
[1:13:15] kill son of
[1:13:17] David son of man right had to
[1:13:21] come but then he comes down Through the
[1:13:23] Ages as Son of God the baptism of the
[1:13:26] Holy Ghost right but in the end time
[1:13:29] he's be revealed as son of
[1:13:32] man then he can go to Israel as son of
[1:13:35] David to me that's marvelous I saw it
[1:13:38] then and I rejoiced and you know I've
[1:13:42] cried and done everything in the book
[1:13:44] Tred to get people to see that well I
[1:13:47] just don't know don't want to get
[1:13:50] confused don't worry honey you already
[1:13:53] are
[1:13:55] you was born and I was born
[1:13:58] confused it's going to take the Holy
[1:14:00] Ghost to straighten this out and just
[1:14:03] because that he went from because now
[1:14:06] I'm going to show you something that's
[1:14:07] going to you're going to think I'm
[1:14:08] against brother brandom we're going to
[1:14:10] give you a quote after where while I or
[1:14:13] this maybe not this
[1:14:14] evening where he said he died son of man
[1:14:17] and Rose Son of God
[1:14:28] I thought the son of man
[1:14:32] raised that's right I thought the son of
[1:14:34] man
[1:14:36] flesh was one that appeared to marry
[1:14:40] that's right I didn't know it was just
[1:14:42] some theophany form of Son of
[1:14:46] God it's the way he's explaining how
[1:14:49] it's going to change
[1:14:52] dispensations it's going to change the
[1:14:54] way he's revealing
[1:14:56] himself CU I said of when he said who
[1:14:59] the man say I son of man they didn't get
[1:15:01] it so he said all right I got to bring
[1:15:03] the church ages right but what's going
[1:15:06] to be amazing is when we get about two
[1:15:08] more sermons over and we'll come back
[1:15:10] into what we preached all 40 something
[1:15:12] years he stands in the midst of the
[1:15:14] seven golden candlesticks one like unto
[1:15:18] the son of
[1:15:22] man because she's going to give birth to
[1:15:24] him whether we believe it or not whether
[1:15:27] we want to be a part of it or
[1:15:30] not that's our
[1:15:32] choice all right what is it same God all
[1:15:36] the time just changing his form right
[1:15:42] well who is the last form of God in the
[1:15:44] Gentile
[1:15:48] dispensation of course the way most
[1:15:50] people believe it it was brother
[1:15:51] brandham now brother brandham was a part
[1:15:53] of the body of Christ cuz he was was a
[1:15:55] born again Christian that's
[1:15:58] right but he was not the complete IM
[1:16:00] morphe of God or the form of God we've
[1:16:02] been through all that we preached it
[1:16:03] over over over but follow it
[1:16:07] now remember between the Son of
[1:16:11] God and remember between the Son of
[1:16:17] God where would his thought be going
[1:16:21] when he would be going between the Son
[1:16:23] of God and what Son of God and Son of
[1:16:26] David he's going to come back as son of
[1:16:30] man does everybody what do you believe
[1:16:32] what I'm saying or not do you
[1:16:35] understand I can't reveal that I can't
[1:16:39] make you see it right but do you
[1:16:42] understand what I'm
[1:16:45] saying well we don't believe you we
[1:16:47] believe brother Brandon well I just read
[1:16:49] what he
[1:16:51] said no you argue with him
[1:16:57] but what about
[1:16:58] it look how he keeps referring and like
[1:17:01] I said isn't it odd cuz these all these
[1:17:04] quotes and things I deliberately brought
[1:17:07] in things about the the end time prophet
[1:17:10] of melachi
[1:17:11] 4 as to keep our thoughts in the
[1:17:15] line the son of man would not be in The
[1:17:19] Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time
[1:17:22] unless God fulfilled his word to bring
[1:17:27] Malachi 4 into
[1:17:30] being in Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7
[1:17:35] that's
[1:17:36] right bless God I don't need no Prophet
[1:17:39] I'll just be what I'm supposed to be I'm
[1:17:41] going to be God made manifest now you're
[1:17:44] the
[1:17:46] devil that's just plain as I can put it
[1:17:50] cuz you got it in the wrong
[1:17:52] line if it ain't lined up straight we're
[1:17:55] not going to come out to the right thing
[1:17:57] that's right right and even if it's
[1:18:00] lined up perfect until it's
[1:18:04] revealed it does us no good that's right
[1:18:07] well it's been revealed to me cuz I read
[1:18:09] it that don't make a
[1:18:12] revelation you read the Bible before you
[1:18:14] heard the prophet that's right why
[1:18:17] wasn't it it was revealed to
[1:18:21] you why because God has to reveal it
[1:18:24] that's right amen
[1:18:26] okay let's go on now and get to thought
[1:18:29] look at the next one number
[1:18:31] seven God's provided place of
[1:18:34] worship 65 425 paragraph
[1:18:38] 192 talking about the coming of the Lord
[1:18:40] Jesus for the Holy Ghost and the living
[1:18:42] presence of the Living God Jesus said in
[1:18:45] St Mark here he said in that day the son
[1:18:48] of man will be revealed that's in Luke
[1:18:50] and brings it out in Mark also now
[1:18:53] remember not Son of God
[1:18:55] he came in three sons names son of man
[1:18:58] Son of God Son of David when he was on
[1:19:01] Earth he come as the son of
[1:19:04] man he was a
[1:19:07] prophet and I said is it
[1:19:11] coincidental that there had to be a
[1:19:15] prophet you know a man on Earth to bring
[1:19:19] the message in the end time if that
[1:19:22] don't give the honor and Glory to the
[1:19:25] position that brother brandom held in I
[1:19:27] don't understand you in your
[1:19:29] thinking cuz that puts the whole
[1:19:32] dependence upon whether or not God sent
[1:19:35] the
[1:19:36] man there's been a lot of good men and
[1:19:39] good thoughts and good preaching and
[1:19:43] thing but see we putting all I or I am
[1:19:46] at least I have everything I've got I
[1:19:48] don't have no extra basket you know in
[1:19:51] financial matters you don't put all of
[1:19:53] your eggs in the same basket well I
[1:19:55] don't have many eggs so it don't matter
[1:19:58] how many
[1:19:59] baskets I could put them in four baskets
[1:20:02] and wouldn't have to worry about too
[1:20:03] many in the baskets all
[1:20:06] right but in religious
[1:20:11] matters that's what I tried to say this
[1:20:14] morning if you're talking about a
[1:20:16] dispensation that reveals a different
[1:20:18] God from one time to the other then
[1:20:20] that's Den that's the doctrine of
[1:20:22] dispensationalist
[1:20:27] theology that goes into into the unified
[1:20:30] part of mankind trying to bring it out
[1:20:34] but to see the same God
[1:20:37] revealed in many
[1:20:40] forms but yet the same
[1:20:42] God that's wonderful to me I me but look
[1:20:46] he came in three sons name son of man
[1:20:48] Son of God Son of David when he was on
[1:20:50] Earth he come a son of man he was a
[1:20:52] prophet son of man is a prophet Jehovah
[1:20:54] himself called the prophets Jeremiah and
[1:20:56] them son of man what sayest thou Jesus
[1:20:59] come because he had to come according to
[1:21:02] the
[1:21:05] scriptures he had to come as the son of
[1:21:09] man Moses said the Lord your God shall
[1:21:13] raise up a prophet liken unto me now
[1:21:17] they he was referring to his own s
[1:21:19] wasn't he because he referring to the
[1:21:20] prophetic
[1:21:21] side and he had to be a prophet son of
[1:21:24] man
[1:21:25] but after his death burial and
[1:21:27] Resurrection now he has been Son of God
[1:21:31] the supernatural the Holy
[1:21:33] Spirit see that's what come back on the
[1:21:35] day of
[1:21:37] Pentecost CU that son of man
[1:21:39] died to release that Holy Ghost and
[1:21:43] after his Ascension and the things that
[1:21:45] happened to that human element of his
[1:21:48] and I believe he raised in an eternal
[1:21:51] body amen so then you you're losing your
[1:21:54] son of man contact point I was just
[1:21:57] trying to bring out an illustration a
[1:21:59] moment
[1:22:00] ago that the prophet is right when he
[1:22:03] died son of man he rose Son of God on
[1:22:06] the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came
[1:22:08] to prove
[1:22:09] it so it's going to be Son of God down
[1:22:11] to seven Church ages right all
[1:22:16] right and look what he goes on to
[1:22:20] say it's the great Holy Spirit this is
[1:22:23] the unveiling of God per
[1:22:25] 65 and notice now as he came he had to
[1:22:29] come a son of man because the holy
[1:22:30] spirit said that he would God would
[1:22:33] raise up a prophet to them so he could
[1:22:35] not come calling himself the Son of God
[1:22:38] because it wasn't that
[1:22:42] dispensation you got it right I need to
[1:22:46] walk
[1:22:48] back you put me down we got
[1:22:52] it got you we got we got it
[1:22:57] okay he could not come calling himself
[1:23:00] the Son of God because it wasn't that
[1:23:02] dispensation that's right all right he
[1:23:07] was the son of man prophesying to
[1:23:09] fulfill and revealed to them all the
[1:23:12] things that had been done and taught
[1:23:14] what he was then he was on the earth as
[1:23:17] son of man then
[1:23:19] say Luke 17:30 says he'll return a son
[1:23:22] of man
[1:23:24] it's no
[1:23:27] coincidence that God would send a
[1:23:30] prophet in this age and
[1:23:34] time right promised in the word now
[1:23:39] these are for me your statements but
[1:23:42] let's just get at least one out of
[1:23:44] it go ahead with number
[1:23:48] nine and think about what he's
[1:23:52] saying now we're in a change ing
[1:23:59] dispensation and never change just like
[1:24:02] building a building you come to the
[1:24:04] corner you have to make that bend it's
[1:24:07] strange everybody wants to run a
[1:24:09] straight line on
[1:24:10] down you'd have just one big wall but
[1:24:14] we're building a building and we've come
[1:24:17] to the
[1:24:18] corners and you got to
[1:24:21] change those Corners as Brother Don
[1:24:23] price so well
[1:24:26] he and so well stated it not long ago at
[1:24:30] those changes is where the Trouble Comes
[1:24:34] where the it's hard on that corner to
[1:24:37] make cut that corner and make it just
[1:24:44] right simple
[1:24:46] illustration we built a house in
[1:24:49] 1965 we had the you call them batter box
[1:24:52] boards or what is it called batter
[1:24:53] boards that you put out and you square
[1:24:56] everything up and you you get it and you
[1:24:58] run your strings you know and you you
[1:25:01] get that right and you start out and and
[1:25:04] it don't matter what this building you
[1:25:07] can take that corner to that corner and
[1:25:10] if the same thing is that corner to that
[1:25:12] corner it's Square he knows that's good
[1:25:16] right it's square if you ever want to do
[1:25:19] anything and you want to get it Square
[1:25:21] just measure from you know this is not
[1:25:23] Square so we'll cut it down a little
[1:25:25] it's measure this corner make sure it's
[1:25:27] same that corner you got it squired you
[1:25:29] can fool around all you want to you can
[1:25:31] cry and pray doing what you want to
[1:25:33] trying to Market just do that and it'll
[1:25:34] Simply Be
[1:25:37] Square we had to do things a little
[1:25:39] different in our
[1:25:40] day and easiest way to level a
[1:25:44] house a
[1:25:46] room is they got it new today cuz it got
[1:25:49] a water
[1:25:50] hose a water glass is the most simple
[1:25:53] thing
[1:25:54] if you wanted to see if this pull pit
[1:25:56] was level set a water
[1:25:59] glass fill it to the
[1:26:02] brim if it's
[1:26:05] off right it won't be right so what's he
[1:26:10] saying he said we're in a change in a
[1:26:15] dispensation all
[1:26:17] right he said everybody wants to go down
[1:26:19] the wall That's Pentecost and different
[1:26:22] ones come see easy if you can get one
[1:26:25] string to the other one to just keep
[1:26:26] things going we underpin a house one
[1:26:29] time and old house we lived in and and
[1:26:32] already had some kind of pillars in it
[1:26:34] and we were doing them well I came in
[1:26:36] one day and my little
[1:26:37] wife she had laid about uh
[1:26:42] 10 6 by
[1:26:44] 10 section of
[1:26:48] blocks and it was good
[1:26:51] good the only problem she had
[1:26:55] she laid according to the Contour of the
[1:27:00] land cuz she didn't know you go over
[1:27:02] step down step down she she just let
[1:27:05] them qu well she done it and she just
[1:27:08] took pieces of concrete and just put it
[1:27:11] in the
[1:27:12] top it was perfect we were going to
[1:27:14] stuck over it anyway so what it matter
[1:27:17] all right but you see anybody can lay a
[1:27:20] straight
[1:27:21] line if you got a string to go with it's
[1:27:23] easy
[1:27:24] he just gets
[1:27:26] distrain but when you come to a corner
[1:27:29] was I saying about that house we built
[1:27:31] the the the patter boxes or what you
[1:27:33] call them put them up well one day this
[1:27:36] cow decided she wanted to go through
[1:27:39] where the building was going to be so
[1:27:41] she tore down in the
[1:27:44] corner well I asked the man I said what
[1:27:46] in the world am I going to do he said
[1:27:47] we'll try to square it like we do corner
[1:27:48] to corner and do the best you can so we
[1:27:51] drove back to Stakes we put them up well
[1:27:53] it looked pretty
[1:27:55] good and they laid the blocks according
[1:27:58] to the strings I put
[1:28:00] by but when we got ready to put down the
[1:28:03] floor
[1:28:04] joist we come to find it out that it
[1:28:07] wouldn't exactly
[1:28:09] square and you know how you do it with
[1:28:11] floor joist if you want to make sure
[1:28:12] they're squared it's take you 4x8 sheet
[1:28:14] of plywood and nail it down on one
[1:28:16] corner it's going to square it so when
[1:28:18] they got over that corner it couldn't
[1:28:20] find out it was sticking over about 2
[1:28:23] Ines and we had to do a little scabbing
[1:28:25] on you know but my point is I wasn't a
[1:28:31] carpenter but a real man that can make
[1:28:35] take that take that corner a real
[1:28:37] Carpenter can start right here on this
[1:28:38] corner and you can worry yourself to
[1:28:41] death he can go to another corner and
[1:28:43] start if he really knows what he's
[1:28:46] doing brother randam knew what he was
[1:28:49] doing that's what he
[1:28:51] said he come to change the
[1:28:54] corner right God sent us a profet to
[1:28:58] change the corner but what did he say
[1:29:00] we're doing we're not building a build a
[1:29:03] a a line a
[1:29:06] wall he said we're building a
[1:29:09] building all right see there had to be
[1:29:12] that last Corner
[1:29:14] turned to make this building come out
[1:29:20] right and let's say that a real
[1:29:22] Carpenter he doesn't have to have all of
[1:29:25] the modern
[1:29:27] things of lines drought for the Gir you
[1:29:31] can tell
[1:29:33] you you get three corners you can get
[1:29:35] the other Corner if you know what you're
[1:29:40] doing might be off for half inch quter
[1:29:43] inch on a big house but not much we got
[1:29:46] a problem for that I'm going to Sol we
[1:29:49] was doing something up at teran's one
[1:29:51] day he looked at it and he said
[1:29:54] daddy that ain't right said that
[1:29:57] corner's off said there's a gap
[1:30:00] there I said we just going to fill that
[1:30:02] up with cocking he said but Daddy they
[1:30:04] don't make 3/4 inch
[1:30:08] caulking all right Shake everybody a
[1:30:11] little
[1:30:12] bit but we're changing he said changing
[1:30:15] dispensation another know down below
[1:30:17] there we're talking about changing
[1:30:20] dispensation see when he come into the
[1:30:23] when this prophet came into being in the
[1:30:25] last days he knew that he wasn't just
[1:30:27] laying a straight line but you know what
[1:30:30] he had to do now this is me
[1:30:34] okay when theusa Street came in see
[1:30:37] Luther Wesley
[1:30:39] Pentecost when theusa Street came in
[1:30:42] they had the lines going straight
[1:30:44] supposed to be to start
[1:30:46] with it was up to him to find that
[1:30:49] corner so what did Brother randam
[1:30:51] do remember he had to back up to the
[1:30:55] Pentecostals and relay every bit of that
[1:30:58] that's right have you heard him enough
[1:30:59] on to say that you
[1:31:03] know his message didn't begin until
[1:31:06] 1963 but in the years of preparation he
[1:31:10] said and the I will restore the years of
[1:31:13] the can of worm P worm Locust the
[1:31:15] caterpillar so he had to back up to that
[1:31:17] line of zusa Street and know that was
[1:31:20] exactly right and shoot that line and
[1:31:22] get that line straight
[1:31:25] and rebuild a
[1:31:28] wall but then he had to make a corner
[1:31:30] that's right to make that finalized
[1:31:33] change
[1:31:34] or dispensation to turn that corner to
[1:31:38] head it back to hit back with
[1:31:41] Luther it had to be a
[1:31:45] prophet so then God would be promis in
[1:31:48] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation
[1:31:51] 10:7 to send us a prophet
[1:31:55] to be able to take that word and turn
[1:31:57] that corner and square back up to be
[1:31:59] able to hit exactly on that other
[1:32:02] one CU hey
[1:32:05] folks you draw a line at 100 100 ft draw
[1:32:09] at 50
[1:32:11] ft and if you don't get it exactly
[1:32:15] squared you can be an inch off in a
[1:32:17] hurry you remember the prophet you shoot
[1:32:20] the
[1:32:21] gun what about it
[1:32:24] you shoot a gun he said you're off a
[1:32:26] high
[1:32:28] here right you just twitch the viral you
[1:32:32] let something putch the barrel move it
[1:32:34] or something Danny Shake in his head
[1:32:36] these shooters know what I'm talking
[1:32:38] about 100 yards you're way
[1:32:41] off see he couldn't afford that God knew
[1:32:45] what he's doing so he went back and let
[1:32:47] that man
[1:32:49] relay all of that building he laid
[1:32:51] Luther in Foundation he laid w ly he
[1:32:54] laid to Pentecost brought it all back to
[1:32:57] Restoration that's
[1:33:00] right then he made the corner that's
[1:33:02] right all
[1:33:04] right now but when he made the
[1:33:09] corner I thought and I'm just honest and
[1:33:12] just always believed
[1:33:16] this I believe what the Bible says
[1:33:20] amen that the apostles prophets pastors
[1:33:23] of his teachers is for the perfecting of
[1:33:26] the
[1:33:30] Saints now once brother Ram got the
[1:33:32] corner laid and turned with his
[1:33:36] message now you and I can go straight
[1:33:38] down that line that's right as long as
[1:33:40] we stay with this
[1:33:42] message but remember we're trying to hit
[1:33:44] where Luther left
[1:33:46] off we're lining up Amen in the right
[1:33:50] way
[1:33:54] they say Tony and I believe he's the
[1:33:56] best tile layer in the
[1:34:00] country but if he don't like what it
[1:34:02] looks like and it ain't exactly
[1:34:06] right he'll take it up and do it
[1:34:09] again that's a good tile
[1:34:12] layer you say w it's just a 16th of an
[1:34:18] inch laying some at Richards the other
[1:34:20] day and I told him I said he said that
[1:34:22] sure is funny looking over one corner I
[1:34:24] said yeah but it' have been a whole lot
[1:34:25] more fun here if I hadn't leaned
[1:34:28] it see instead of putting it down square
[1:34:31] and being with the wall and all that
[1:34:33] being perfect I turned
[1:34:36] it made this wall straight and that wall
[1:34:39] come off about that far and if it hadn't
[1:34:42] this wall over here would look like that
[1:34:43] on one end and that way on the other end
[1:34:45] you ever hung
[1:34:47] vinyl you don't hang vinyl from the
[1:34:52] bottom you measure from the top down
[1:34:57] right and if you got to put anything out
[1:34:59] of line put it out of line on the bottom
[1:35:01] right and then lay it all up there and
[1:35:04] you come up to the top and you got 14 ft
[1:35:07] or 20 ft or 100 ft you want it to look
[1:35:09] right cuz you sure don't want it look
[1:35:11] like that on one then and that on the
[1:35:13] other
[1:35:14] one it shows up you don't know what
[1:35:16] you're doing so you get out of level
[1:35:18] down who's going to look at the bottom
[1:35:19] and say oh that ain't
[1:35:22] level no
[1:35:27] let see brother random put it right amen
[1:35:30] this message is Right amen he laid that
[1:35:33] corner
[1:35:35] perfectly his message is laid that
[1:35:37] corner he said we're not building a wall
[1:35:41] we're building a
[1:35:42] building well I thought the building
[1:35:45] that we were supposed to be building is
[1:35:47] the body of Jesus Christ into the
[1:35:49] stature of a perfect
[1:35:50] man
[1:35:52] amen right
[1:35:54] and I believe the five full
[1:35:56] ministry you see them now my Lord they
[1:36:01] come one time and got did and he said I
[1:36:03] want you to come to help
[1:36:04] me what you want and I know you can lay
[1:36:07] blocked I've seen you he said we're
[1:36:09] building chicken houses 300t
[1:36:13] long you can do it I said
[1:36:17] yeah but I said you wouldn't want to
[1:36:19] work my way he said what I said if it
[1:36:22] don't look right I'll tear it down start
[1:36:23] again I'm Tony with
[1:36:26] that he wouldn't like it for 3 days
[1:36:28] later I'm still turning the wall down
[1:36:29] putting it
[1:36:31] back cuz I want it to be
[1:36:33] right see this message is Right
[1:36:36] folks the prophet came and turned that
[1:36:40] corner he gave us all the dimensions all
[1:36:43] of the
[1:36:46] things and told
[1:36:48] us we got done on Wade's house
[1:36:50] remodeling it and we had a GU with a TR
[1:36:53] it to shoot
[1:36:55] it you know perfectly in line perfectly
[1:37:02] level we laid the for
[1:37:05] the foundation I look side that house we
[1:37:09] started lay to re BL I said this thing
[1:37:10] ain't
[1:37:12] right we said will he shot it was a
[1:37:15] Transit I know I help him I drove the
[1:37:18] stage and I marked the mark and put
[1:37:20] the stay right
[1:37:24] he said what do you
[1:37:26] mean I said it's out about 2
[1:37:30] Ines and we can't afford that cuz the
[1:37:32] house is going to be sitting off the
[1:37:34] corner
[1:37:36] right you see that's how people are
[1:37:39] sometimes made for jobs of doing
[1:37:42] things Brother Gary does a marvelous job
[1:37:46] of building that's right it's good to
[1:37:49] build behind him you know it's good to
[1:37:52] work on something he's worked on
[1:37:54] because you can depend on it being
[1:37:56] Squire things will be right we see
[1:37:59] that's what we are in the five4 ministry
[1:38:01] the fold Ministry is to Build That Wall
[1:38:04] after the prophet turned the corner
[1:38:06] right now what do we build it with he
[1:38:08] gave us all the material he gave us
[1:38:11] everything I don't have to worry about
[1:38:13] laying
[1:38:14] blocks I just line
[1:38:17] up with a
[1:38:20] message and look down to there you get
[1:38:23] into machinist work any you have your
[1:38:26] machinist in here the Donny I know he's
[1:38:28] worked kind of around there but you know
[1:38:30] there's people that can see 5,000 of an
[1:38:32] inch in machinist work that's how good
[1:38:35] the eyeball is 5,000 that's a good
[1:38:38] chewing gum
[1:38:42] paper ain't even that
[1:38:45] thick if we're that
[1:38:49] particular why wouldn't we be particular
[1:38:53] is that not what Paul
[1:38:56] says be careful how you build upon the
[1:39:01] foundation is that
[1:39:03] scripture you get it lined up straight
[1:39:07] we've got to string strung from one
[1:39:09] corner to the other one we just keep
[1:39:11] laying it right on down the line four 40
[1:39:15] years later we're still
[1:39:17] laying but somebody's going to complete
[1:39:20] this
[1:39:21] building it's going to be finished
[1:39:23] cuz we're changing
[1:39:25] dispensation it isn't a wall it's a
[1:39:29] building he builds a
[1:39:33] house and there's many cuts and
[1:39:36] turns that he's predicted here in the
[1:39:43] Bible why don't we believe it what are
[1:39:46] those turns and cuts let's deal with it
[1:39:49] just a little amen we're going to have
[1:39:51] another sermon out of this one
[1:39:55] look at number
[1:39:57] 11 we we kicked off 10 we can number 11
[1:40:01] 64 427 where he called a trial on tson

[1:40:09] when the Son of God will be revealed he
[1:40:11] was revealed in the church
[1:40:14] age I read
[1:40:16] it he was revealed in the church
[1:40:21] age Son of God
[1:40:24] but the church has put him out that's
[1:40:26] right that's what they put out they put
[1:40:28] out the Son of
[1:40:31] God they didn't want it now when it
[1:40:34] begin to be lined up when that Prophet
[1:40:36] begin to get them corners and bringing
[1:40:38] it
[1:40:41] down they didn't like it it's too
[1:40:47] straight too straight to talk to women
[1:40:49] about cutting their hair painting the
[1:40:51] face wearing pants different things men
[1:40:55] long AR too

[1:41:40] Pentecost ususa Street
[1:41:43] Pentecost then the word
[1:41:46] comes look 236 then he would be revealed
[1:41:49] a son of man when the son of man is
[1:41:51] being revealed God God manifested
[1:41:54] amongst the human
[1:41:59] beings like it was then son of man

[1:42:20] he come to preach he was a monk to human
[1:42:23] beings
[1:42:27] Glory that's good well now in a
[1:42:31] minute when we read it's in the
[1:42:36] people are you going to shout about
[1:42:41] that remember this morning raise your

[1:43:02] man is being
[1:43:04] revealed God among God manifested
[1:43:07] amongst the human beings like it was
[1:43:09] then son of man Prophet okay we go
[1:43:12] brother brandham was the prophet he had
[1:43:15] the resurrection message
[1:43:18] right he had the dead raising message
[1:43:23] physically and
[1:43:25] spiritually all
[1:43:27] right but now let's read on a
[1:43:30] little go to the next one number
[1:43:33] 12 which is the unveiling of God 1964 PR
[1:43:38] 73 far for his acts now remember he's in
[1:43:42] the acts of a
[1:43:44] play uh it's on the unveiling of God F
[1:43:47] must taken he said that he just acted
[1:43:49] the part of
[1:43:51] death cuz all of this is AC acting
[1:43:54] amen remember you got to have characters
[1:43:57] if you're going to have
[1:43:58] acting right for for his acts to change
[1:44:03] he changes his form then he came the son
[1:44:07] of man now
[1:44:09] watch divide that so don't read that he
[1:44:12] came the son of man and then think the

[1:44:18] man now starts your sent for the
[1:44:20] reformers age Wesley Luther and all down
[1:44:23] through then we find out they got it so
[1:44:25] bundled up just like the Israelites did
[1:44:28] then when he does appear in the last
[1:44:30] days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy
[1:44:34] Spirit they rejected they did the same
[1:44:37] thing Israel did and what does he do
[1:44:42] now he's going to be rejected and then
[1:44:45] he returns as son of man and then from
[1:44:49] that son of David see how close we are
[1:44:52] son of man son of David Son of God is
[1:44:55] revealed in the last days as son of man
[1:44:58] according to Malachi 4 all the rest of
[1:45:02] prophecies pertaining to this
[1:45:05] hour no more dealing with the church
[1:45:08] after he they put him out on the outside

[1:45:16] seed in there yet be he must get to
[1:45:20] them now

[1:48:26] is wearing out the best for me just to
[1:48:28] stay home be the best I
[1:48:31] can I'm just if I quit I'll just sit
[1:48:35] down here we not worry about it cuz why
[1:48:39] why me be concerned with trying to go
[1:48:41] help somebody you go preach in their
[1:48:43] church and then way went one the other
[1:48:47] day man got it behind him you know and
[1:48:48] said now if there's any seed in it not
[1:48:50] worth seed just throw it out
[1:48:53] I have got up and said tell me where the
[1:48:56] seed is you
[1:49:00] know but that's the way people
[1:49:05] go where we
[1:49:07] at we turn his son of man then son of
[1:49:10] David how close we are look where we at
[1:49:12] go to the next one he's outside the
[1:49:15] church as Son of God trying to reveal
[1:49:17] himself as son of
[1:49:19] man and look as I said brother Brandon
[1:49:22] was welcome El in his early
[1:49:25] Ministry everybody wanted him oh he's
[1:49:28] got some strange Doctrine about serpent
[1:49:30] seed but we still want him cuz he draws
[1:49:32] a big crowd and we get a big old money
[1:49:35] out of it you know and we get a lot of
[1:49:37] people come in our
[1:49:39] churches well isn't it odd that's the
[1:49:41] way it was with the Lord Jesus that's
[1:49:43] right the young Prophet From Galilee was
[1:49:48] welcomed but when he begin to say I my
[1:49:50] father one
[1:49:53] he wouldn't too
[1:49:54] welcomed look what he says on the
[1:49:56] unveiling of God paragraph 8 184 oh
[1:49:58] brother sister are you catching it
[1:50:00] congregation says amen look don't don't
[1:50:02] you see it it's been veiled through
[1:50:04] these
[1:50:07] ages okay according to what God Said and
[1:50:10] it will be opened in the last days those
[1:50:13] Seven Seals would be broke and the full
[1:50:15] thing would come into view of the people
[1:50:18] what took place all along the hour of
[1:50:21] the seventh angel
[1:50:23] message
[1:50:25] what all the mysteries of God should be
[1:50:28] made known in that Elijah this last hour
[1:50:32] how that Christ is put out of his church
[1:50:34] the Son of
[1:50:35] God how he is revealed as son of man
[1:50:39] again how that the church is to be put
[1:50:42] in order and everything for the last
[1:50:45] days l no Creed no
[1:50:49] denomination you remember that quote
[1:50:51] from the message on the fullness of the
[1:50:54] godhead bodily brother said no leing
[1:50:56] among her brings the fullness of the
[1:50:59] godhead no Creed no denomination
[1:51:02] absolutely the word living in the
[1:51:03] individual I'll take one and leave one
[1:51:06] now he ain't dealing with just a prophet
[1:51:08] right I'll take this and leave that one
[1:51:11] that's just there's no strings no
[1:51:13] denomination no bindings or nothing it's
[1:51:16] the it's the heart with God and him
[1:51:21] alone he said see
[1:51:27] look at the next one the
[1:51:31] Rapture preaching 65 1204 paragraph
[1:51:35] 117 and now that's the age that we're
[1:51:37] living in right now the seventh Church
[1:51:40] age now it's all to be manifest in the
[1:51:43] grain of
[1:51:44] wheat at the
[1:51:47] end now are you with me did have the all
[1:51:51] of the message that I preached about the
[1:51:52] grain of wheat the original to come back
[1:51:56] if you lost that if it's not drop back
[1:51:58] about 3 months ago and start listening
[1:52:00] over and come up to where we at you'll
[1:52:02] see what I'm talking about notice it's
[1:52:04] all to be manifested in the grain of
[1:52:06] wheat at the end another comeback now if
[1:52:10] you'll take Luke the 17th chapter and
[1:52:13] the 30th
[1:52:14] verse he's referring to the grain of
[1:52:21] wheat and it was in the days of Sodom so
[1:52:23] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[1:52:25] man when the son of man begins to reveal
[1:52:27] himself what is reveal make his
[1:52:30] revelation of what he is in this day
[1:52:34] revealed reveal out to the people the
[1:52:37] word that's made known for the day
[1:52:40] revealed to the People by the
[1:52:42] manifestation of the Holy Spirit making
[1:52:45] that Jesus live among us
[1:52:52] that's a promise for this
[1:52:54] age let me
[1:52:59] get
[1:53:00] okay corn of
[1:53:05] wheat U byass 15 go to
[1:53:11] 16 the unveiling of God paragraph 318
[1:53:14] and the remember the grain must be
[1:53:16] germatize
[1:53:17] see come back to Perfection back to
[1:53:21] regular grain again all right
[1:53:23] right the grain must be gered see if it
[1:53:26] don't it won't live see none of that was
[1:53:29] outside of them messages will ever come
[1:53:32] to
[1:53:33] life look how straight a man could
[1:53:37] talk it has to be gerti to it but
[1:53:41] remember the same life that was in the
[1:53:43] stalk is in the grain it's just maturing
[1:53:46] itself right back see the see he
[1:53:49] revealed himself what son of man the
[1:53:53] grain that went into the
[1:53:55] ground get the message congregation said
[1:53:59] amen oh boy ain't that something
[1:54:04] amen where are they
[1:54:06] now the Greek said to him we would see
[1:54:09] Jesus he said except the grain of corn
[1:54:12] fall into the
[1:54:14] ground see all right now I'll end right
[1:54:18] there I saying
[1:54:20] this go listen to
[1:54:23] s we would see
[1:54:25] Jesus and see if it's not referring that
[1:54:30] when they come to
[1:54:33] Jesus they come to see
[1:54:37] God go get the
[1:54:40] message when they come to see Jesus sir
[1:54:42] we would see Jesus they wouldn't saying
[1:54:44] we want to see
[1:54:46] Jesus you know they knew that had to be
[1:54:49] part they wanted to see God
[1:54:55] come on get it listen to the table see
[1:54:56] what your Prophet said they wanted to
[1:54:59] see God I'll bring it the next message
[1:55:01] nothing
[1:55:04] El when they got there they wanted to
[1:55:08] see
[1:55:09] God but what did God
[1:55:13] say God said lest a corn of wheat dies
[1:55:16] and go to the ground it theide
[1:55:20] alone but if it goes forth it'll come
[1:55:23] forth in multiple
[1:55:27] forms they wanted to see God the only
[1:55:30] way you'll ever see God is through the
[1:55:33] grain of wheat that goes into the
[1:55:35] ground the grain of wheat is the
[1:55:39] word the son of
[1:55:43] man is the only sewer of the seed that
[1:55:45] there
[1:55:48] is that's why brother brandom listen
[1:55:52] could stand here in the end time to not
[1:55:54] give us a different Revelation but could
[1:55:56] tell us what no
[1:55:59] man could ever tell
[1:56:03] you the Lord Jesus preached six seals in
[1:56:06] Matthew
[1:56:09] 24 he didn't preach the seventh that's
[1:56:13] right am I right that's
[1:56:16] right and see a Prophet come taking us
[1:56:20] into
[1:56:20] to not what Jesus didn't preach I don't
[1:56:25] believe that I don't believe brother
[1:56:27] random could bring anything to you and I
[1:56:28] that wouldn't in the word of
[1:56:32] God see Jesus knew he was the corn of
[1:56:35] wheat that going into the
[1:56:37] ground you remember the message the corn
[1:56:39] of wheat had to go into the ground in
[1:56:40] the dark ages to the church are you with
[1:56:42] me still in the message but promised to
[1:56:45] be restored to the full original grain
[1:56:47] again in the end time in The Bride of
[1:56:50] Jesus Christ
[1:56:53] I'm just trying to tell us where we
[1:56:57] are I wish have G out some way and I had
[1:57:00] a great education some words or
[1:57:02] something to be able to express
[1:57:06] it somebody has got to make the word
[1:57:10] manifest that's right I didn't write the
[1:57:13] message I wasn't the prophet that said
[1:57:16] the bride is to vindicate Malachi 4
[1:57:19] right vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate
[1:57:22] Revelations 10:7 and these other
[1:57:25] things well I didn't know he'd said
[1:57:29] that you got a computer run it in if you
[1:57:31] ain't call
[1:57:33] me but I put it on the message a dozen
[1:57:39] times man told me one time he said
[1:57:41] something I said you hang on a
[1:57:44] minute I got to go fire at my
[1:57:47] computer because my natural computer
[1:57:49] says brother R said so and so that's my
[1:57:51] brain
[1:57:54] but you don't you won't bleed my
[1:57:58] brain so if I can't find
[1:58:02] it if I can't find that quote for you
[1:58:05] all that he just said what I said
[1:58:09] it I'll send you an apology and you can
[1:58:13] send it to the world that I'm a false
[1:58:19] prophet I said because I know he said it
[1:58:22] I just don't have the memory to tell you
[1:58:24] the page
[1:58:27] number I reckon he figured if I was that
[1:58:30] straight about
[1:58:31] it then I knew what I was talking
[1:58:37] about but that's where people think well
[1:58:39] I don't know he said that that's why I
[1:58:42] read
[1:58:43] it you can't argue with me about what I
[1:58:47] read right come on musicians
[1:58:52] we'll make a number three out of this
[1:58:53] thing
[1:58:56] am but see church I'm just trying my
[1:58:59] best to get you and I to
[1:59:01] realize what God has made
[1:59:05] us it is he that hath made us the
[1:59:07] scripture
[1:59:08] said and not we
[1:59:11] ourselves the Bible says you can't
[1:59:14] even that was written for to come up
[1:59:16] with all this paint and stuff I said you
[1:59:18] can't add no color to your hood nowadays
[1:59:21] they add color to it you can't add one
[1:59:23] heart to it now you just going to get
[1:59:24] your transplant I'm not against that I'm
[1:59:27] just saying what the Bible

[1:59:40] up and they had a few parts left and
[1:59:42] they had you know parts of him and they
[1:59:44] put it back and they just made him a
[1:59:46] bionic body that's right call him a
[1:59:49] Million Dollar Man Danny sitting back

[1:59:52] million yet he pretty
[1:59:56] close he goes by he goes by guy can
[2:00:01] go they think his gold hung up in
[2:00:05] there but
[2:00:07] now they've got almost total
[2:00:10] bodies made from
[2:00:15] Material brother R said they broke into
[2:00:17] God's laboratory right
[2:00:22] it's amazing what mankind can
[2:00:25] do but it's remember it's because God
[2:00:30] give him the ability let's stand what we
