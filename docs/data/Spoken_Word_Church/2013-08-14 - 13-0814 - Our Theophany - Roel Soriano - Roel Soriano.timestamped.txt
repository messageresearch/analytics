[4:10] Sister June. And last night we were
[4:12] together uh brother Sam and sister Peggy
[4:15] over dinner and the Lord just um gave us
[4:18] some glorious time of fellowship. Amen.
[4:21] Um we're still praying that uh the Lord
[4:24] would somehow place it in brother Sam's
[4:27] um heart to go back to the Philippines.
[4:30] Amen. Or if not brother Wade. We kind of
[4:34] waited for him to come uh last
[4:37] January, but maybe it's uh it wasn't the

[4:42] right. Um but we're praying we're
[4:45] praying that uh you could uh uh come
[4:48] back to the Philippines because um uh by
[4:51] what's happening in our country uh
[4:54] nowadays there's a lot of uh there's a
[4:56] lot of new churches that have come into
[4:59] the message by way of the mystery expo
[5:02] seminars that we conduct and uh uh and
[5:06] uh we just need all the ministry that we
[5:08] can get and uh I know that you have a
[5:11] good teaching ministry in this church
[5:14] and and uh people stream your services
[5:17] here in the Philippines and
[5:20] uh I know that many people are many
[5:23] believers are praying that u some of you
[5:25] brothers can come over and minister to
[5:28] us. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well,
[5:30] before I uh let you be seated,
[5:34] um we'll look at our
[5:37] text and approach God in prayer. Yes,
[5:40] sir. I'm going to speak about uh our
[5:43] theophony. Amen. It's going to be a
[5:45] short Bible study. Amen. All right. On
[5:49] our theophony,
[5:51] which is our glorious body. Our glorious
[5:55] body. Hallelujah. There you go. There
[5:59] you go.
[6:03] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 and
[6:06] 2 is where um brother Benham uh went as
[6:12] as a
[6:13] reference on this subject and it reads
[6:17] for we know that if our earthly house of
[6:21] this
[6:22] tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[6:25] building of
[6:27] God and house not made with hands Amen.
[6:30] Eternal in the heavens. Amen. For in
[6:34] this we grown earnestly desiring to be
[6:38] clothed upon with our house which is
[6:42] from heaven. That's right. Amen. These
[6:44] are the words of the Lord. Let's pray.
[6:46] Heavenly Father, we ask that you uh
[6:49] would come in our midst once again as we
[6:53] approach uh your word humbly. Father, we
[6:56] ask that you uh give us of your spirit,
[6:59] Lord, so we can uh come to a clear
[7:02] understanding of this uh important
[7:05] subject. Just be with us, Father. And I
[7:08] pray you uh touch every person and meet
[7:11] every need that's represented here in
[7:12] this assembly this evening. We thank you
[7:15] and we want to give you all the praise
[7:17] and honor and glory. In Jesus name we
[7:19] pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. You can be
[7:22] seated.
[7:24] Hallelujah.
[7:26] Amen. Amen. So I believe this is a great
[7:28] subject. Amen.
[7:31] Theophony. The word theophony
[7:34] um uh actually comes from two Greek
[7:38] words.
[7:39] Theos and fes.
[7:42] Theos is god and fises is a form or a
[7:47] body. Amen. Um, so put together,
[7:51] theophony actually means the body of
[7:54] God. Amen. That's the form that God is
[7:57] in. The body that God is in.
[8:02] Uh um at
[8:05] first being a young student of the
[8:10] word, it kind of puzzled me.
[8:14] Uh this scripture in 2 Corinthians kind
[8:17] of puzzled
[8:19] me because it was supposed to be talking
[8:23] about uh our heavenly bodies. Yeah. But
[8:27] if you read in in verse one, there's
[8:30] nothing in verse one that suggests that
[8:33] it is a body. Right. It's only in verse
[8:36] two that you get a hint. Right. Right.
[8:39] You know this verse one talks about
[8:41] earthly house and
[8:44] tabernacle that can be dissolved and
[8:47] talks about the building of God a house
[8:50] not made with hands and eternal in the
[8:53] heaven. You know um at first you would
[8:55] think that uh St. Paul was speaking
[8:58] about uh our mansions or or some some uh
[9:02] some uh uh physical structure that is
[9:05] waiting for us in heaven. But if you
[9:07] read in but we read in verse two where
[9:09] it says for in this we grown earnestly
[9:13] desiring to be clothed upon so this this
[9:18] house
[9:19] is actually a garment right right
[9:22] hallelujah we can that we can put on
[9:25] exactly
[9:27] upon with our house which is from heaven
[9:32] and uh I uh if you have u a digital
[9:36] Bible and you click click the the word
[9:39] house
[9:40] there in your Greek Greek lexican. The
[9:44] word used there is oiterion
[9:50] which actually means a dwelling place
[9:55] or a habitation
[9:58] and it speaks of the body as a dwelling
[10:01] place for the spirit. Right? Hallelujah.
[10:04] So it actually speaks of the body where
[10:08] the spirit lives, right? Exactly.
[10:11] Hallelujah. And if you click on the word
[10:13] tabernacle in verse one, this earthly
[10:16] house of this tabernacle be the soul.
[10:18] You know, you click that and the word
[10:22] used there is kanos,
[10:24] which actually means a tabernacle, a
[10:27] tent. It speaks metaphorically of the
[10:31] human body
[10:33] in which the soul dwells us in a tent,
[10:37] right? Uh uh and which is taken down at
[10:41] death. A tent is like a temporary
[10:43] dwelling place.
[10:46] And uh when you don't have uh any use
[10:48] for it, it is taken down. Right. Right.
[10:51] So, uh the tabernacle, the house that
[10:54] was uh spoken of in uh uh in our
[10:58] scripture here uh is actually speaks
[11:00] about this body.
[11:03] The scripture is telling us that after
[11:05] this body has been dismantled or
[11:07] dissolved. Hallelujah. That God has
[11:11] another body waiting for us
[11:15] eternal in the heaven. which means we
[11:18] move from one dwelling place into
[11:21] another. Amen. Hallelujah. This is a
[11:25] physical uh earthly body made up of 16
[11:29] elements.
[11:31] But we know that this is just a
[11:33] temporary dwelling place for us.
[11:36] Hallelujah. And this is not uh uh the
[11:40] perfect body that God wants us to be
[11:42] dwelling into. Hallelujah. And so we
[11:46] understand that we are not in our
[11:49] correct dwelling place so to speak.
[11:52] Amen. Because in this body we go through
[11:54] all kinds of suffering and pain, right?
[12:00] And uh this body gets weak and uh and uh
[12:04] uh gets ill. And we know that God has uh
[12:09] something better for us. Hallelujah.
[12:13] It's it's an eternal house.
[12:18] Hallelujah. To understand this
[12:22] better in in Hebrews chapter 4 better uh
[12:27] uh spoke on the Hebrews series and and
[12:31] in chapter 4 he explicitly spoke about
[12:35] the theophony. Right? It says, "In the
[12:38] beginning, God was a
[12:40] spirit and all the fountain of goodness
[12:44] and mercy and power and all the good
[12:47] things of love, God was the center of
[12:50] that fountain.
[12:52] And then the logos that went out of God
[12:55] in the beginning become what we would
[12:57] call a theophony."
[13:00] There's your clue right there. Right.
[13:03] Uh, brother Benham calls the logos a
[13:07] theophony, right? Hallelujah.
[13:11] Or a supernatural body. Amen. It's a
[13:15] supernatural body. God is just not like
[13:19] the air, right? Because the air is
[13:22] formless.
[13:24] Hallelujah. But he is in a body. Amen.
[13:27] God was living in a body. Amen.
[13:31] something came out of him and it's
[13:34] called the logos. Better Bum said the
[13:36] better word for the logos is theophony.
[13:41] Hallelujah.
[13:42] So that logos that uh uh went out of God
[13:46] became the body in which God dwelt in.
[13:50] So what happened was uh that that great
[13:53] logos came out of God and God dwelt into
[13:57] that logos. Hallelujah. That became his
[14:00] body, his supernatural body.
[14:04] Hallelujah. Moses seen him pass and said
[14:08] it looked like the back part, the back
[14:11] part of a man. Hallelujah. And so forth.
[14:16] And that same theophony was made flesh
[14:20] and dwelt amongst us. And we beheld him,
[14:24] the only begotten of the father, Christ.
[14:28] And now the logos that went out of God
[14:31] which which was the logos all this begin
[14:34] to form into a body shape. Amen.
[14:37] Hallelujah. It's it's shaped like a
[14:39] human body. Amen. Hallelujah. And all
[14:42] this begin to form in a body shape. And
[14:44] this body shape was called in the
[14:46] scholars teaching the logos.
[14:50] And the logos that went out of God.
[14:54] Right? Hallelujah.
[14:57] The next slide. In other words, a better
[14:59] word for it was what we call a
[15:02] theophony. There he says again. He says
[15:05] it again. The logos is actually the
[15:09] theophony of God. Exactly. Hallelujah.
[15:12] It's the same thing. Hallelujah.
[15:15] It's a body where God dwelt in.
[15:19] Theophony is a human body that's
[15:22] glorified. Amen. Not exactly with flesh
[15:25] and blood like it will be in our
[15:27] glorified stage. But Venom qualifies his
[15:30] statement. Theophony is not is not the
[15:34] our glorified body because our glorified
[15:37] body is nothing but our human body
[15:39] glorified. Now the theophony you don't
[15:42] have to glorify theophony because it's
[15:44] already glorious.
[15:46] It's already a glorious body.
[15:49] Hallelujah. It's already glorified in
[15:51] its original state. Amen. So uh there
[15:55] goes a difference. It's different from
[15:56] the glorified
[15:58] body. Uh said not exactly with flesh and
[16:02] blood like it will be in its glorified
[16:04] state but it is a form of a human body
[16:08] that doesn't eat neither does it drink.
[16:13] But it's a body a body that's waiting
[16:17] for us as soon as we live this one.
[16:19] Right. Amen. Hallelujah. Now in there we
[16:22] enter into that body and that's the kind
[16:26] of body that God was.
[16:29] So God was in a body.
[16:33] At first he was a spirit and then out of
[16:36] this eternal spirit came out the logos
[16:39] of God. Now now that logos had a form.
[16:45] Hallelujah. And the form of it was like
[16:48] a human body. Amen. Okay,
[16:52] clear and and that's a kind of body uh
[16:57] um now in there he said we enter into
[17:00] that body right 2 Corinthians 5:1 after
[17:05] we leave this body then we go to another
[17:08] body and it's an eternal body it's the
[17:11] very same exact same body that God had
[17:15] in the beginning
[17:17] hallelujah the very log goas
[17:19] Yes sir. Of God. Right.
[17:23] Hallelujah. For he said next slide
[17:26] please. For he said let us make man in
[17:30] our own image and in our likeness.
[17:34] So if God was theophony when he created
[17:36] man he created man as theophony. Amen.
[17:40] The very exact image and likeness of
[17:43] God. Right. Amen. Hallelujah. He was he
[17:47] had an eternal body. Man had to have an
[17:50] eternal body too.
[17:53] Hallelujah. Uh and in the beginning was
[17:56] the same. He was that great spirit
[17:58] fountain where all the tress, all the
[18:04] love, all the peace, everything that was
[18:06] pure was in this fountain. And then it
[18:10] became to form a body, a theophony. The
[18:14] kind of body that we go to,
[18:17] not a glorified body, but an angelic
[18:20] body like that had shape and form. Amen.
[18:25] It's an angelic body.
[18:28] Hallelujah. The same bodies that the
[18:30] angels
[18:32] have. This is eternal
[18:36] body has shape and form.
[18:41] Okay, let's go to the uh um next slide.
[18:44] Let's talk about Peter's angel. Yeah.
[18:49] You know, one time they killed John, the
[18:52] brother of James.
[18:54] And and they arrested uh Hero arrest had
[18:58] Peter arrested next, right? Of course,
[19:01] uh you all know what's going to happen
[19:03] next. He was put in prison. He he he'll
[19:06] be put out on trial. And the next thing
[19:09] they're going to kill him.
[19:12] Hallelujah. And so the Bible, we read in
[19:15] the Bible where the church got
[19:16] desperate. That's right. And they prayed
[19:19] day and night. Hallelujah. For Peter's
[19:22] deliverance. They prayed for Peter that
[19:24] God would set him free.
[19:27] Because if not, it would mean a certain
[19:29] death to him. Hallelujah. So they they
[19:33] were praying in a house in the house of
[19:36] uh um of Mary
[19:40] um John's mother and u they were all
[19:44] praying and as they were praying God
[19:48] performed a miracle. Right. Amen. That's
[19:50] right. And I mean u there was uh a
[19:54] series of uh doors u uh uh that that uh
[20:00] leads out of the p the prison and there
[20:03] were guards st station at every door.
[20:06] But the angel of the Lord, an angel of
[20:09] the Lord appeared to Peter and broke the
[20:12] chains, right? And he accompanied Peter,
[20:15] gave him instructions to follow him. And
[20:17] they they they both went through the
[20:20] doors together. Y and then when it came
[20:23] to the to the great uh uh uh steel door
[20:27] that leads into the city, we read in the
[20:30] Bible that that it came out open in its
[20:34] own accord.
[20:36] It was like an electronic door
[20:39] that came open in its own accord.
[20:43] Hallelujah. And and Peter was set free
[20:46] by the angel of the Lord in a
[20:49] supernatural way.
[20:51] And here comes Peter knocking on the
[20:54] house of the on on the gate on the door
[20:58] of the house where they were having a
[21:00] prayer meeting. Hallelujah. Can you
[21:02] imagine the brothers and sisters were
[21:04] all praying, "Oh Lord, set Peter free."
[21:07] Yeah. Yeah. And the Lord set him free
[21:10] and he was at the door knocking and and
[21:13] and one young sister recognized his
[21:16] voice and she went and told the brothers
[21:19] and sisters that were praying for Peter
[21:21] and said, "Answered prayer. Peter is at
[21:25] the door." Hallelujah. Knocking.
[21:28] Exactly. And here's what they told him.
[21:31] you are mad.
[21:33] Hallelujah.
[21:35] And sometimes I think if this is not the
[21:38] case with us, right? Amen. We pray for
[21:42] something and God answers our prayers
[21:45] and we think it's incredible when it
[21:47] happens.
[21:49] Hallelujah.
[21:51] Verse 14, we read, "And when she knew
[21:55] Peter's
[21:56] voice, she opened not the gate for
[21:59] gladness, but ran in and told how Peter
[22:03] stood before the gate." And here's uh
[22:06] here's their response. Verse 15, "And
[22:09] they said unto her, thou art mad."
[22:13] This what you're telling us is
[22:15] impossible.
[22:16] Hallelujah. because Peter is in jail and
[22:19] tomorrow he might die. Hallelujah. But
[22:22] they just prayed for Peter.
[22:25] I was thinking of the day when uh I
[22:28] asked the deacon board and the elders of
[22:30] the church in a meeting to uh look for a
[22:34] a lot. I told them look for at least 800
[22:38] square meters.
[22:41] And uh where we're
[22:43] living in in the city of Pacig
[22:46] um the cost of real estate is uh
[22:50] astronomical. I mean there's and and
[22:54] they were thinking it's not just not
[22:56] possible for us to be able to buy a lot
[23:00] that big in order to build our church on
[23:02] it. Well, in 2009 there was a flood. Uh
[23:07] I we were talking about the monsoons in
[23:09] the Philippines and and uh uh I think
[23:12] about uh three months amount of rain
[23:18] uh poured in 3 days time
[23:22] and so it flooded the the the the whole
[23:25] Metro Manila and there was 8 ft of water
[23:28] in h in our house and uh uh where we
[23:32] used to hold services in the school we
[23:35] kept all our stuff, musical instruments,
[23:38] sound system in a storage in the school
[23:41] and uh the school grounds got flooded.
[23:43] There was 10 ft of water in the schools
[23:46] and we lost all our equipment. We lost
[23:48] we just lost everything and and uh and
[23:52] the need was urgent. Sure. Something in
[23:56] me, right?
[23:58] Kept telling me now you need to move.
[24:01] Now you need to find a place. Right. And
[24:03] so I had an emergency meeting and I said
[24:06] not not less than 800 square
[24:08] meters look look for a lot and uh that
[24:13] to be to uh the cost of a lot 800 square
[24:16] square meter big in in uh in uh in in
[24:22] Pasik City uh would be about
[24:25] uh uh maybe 56 million peso pesos which
[24:30] would be about how much would that
[24:33] about
[24:35] 100 140 150,000
[24:38] dollars and that's a lot of money in the
[24:40] Philippines. That's a lot of money here.
[24:43] Amen. It's a lot of money in the
[24:45] Philippines.
[24:46] So the the the brothers, you know, the
[24:49] officers in our church, the they would
[24:52] say, "Yes, pastor, we're going to look
[24:53] for a
[24:54] lot as you wish." You know, but they
[24:59] would talk behind my back.
[25:02] We would pray but after praying and we
[25:05] we dismissed they would talk behind my
[25:07] back and
[25:08] say I think brother has lost it.
[25:13] [Laughter]
[25:15] But praise God today we have a beautiful
[25:18] church. Brother uh uh uh brother Sam and
[25:23] brother uh brother Wade they they they
[25:26] saw the pictures. Amen. Amen. And uh uh
[25:30] the Lord uh provided not just 800 square
[25:34] meters but
[25:35] 1,250 square meters of property
[25:40] and the Lord provided for everything.
[25:43] Amen. Hallelujah.
[25:49] What am I trying to tell you? When you
[25:50] you pray for something, you believe it.
[25:53] Exactly. You believe God's promise
[25:57] and count on God to keep his promise.
[25:59] Hallelujah. Amen. But the first
[26:02] Christians,
[26:04] they found it hard to believe that but
[26:06] that Peter was actually knocking on the
[26:09] door. And they said, "Thou art mad." But
[26:12] then she constantly affirmed that it was
[26:15] even so. And then said, "They, it is his
[26:19] angel." Yeah, that's not Peter. You must
[26:23] have seen his angel.
[26:25] [Laughter]
[26:27] Hallelujah.
[26:30] But if you continue reading, you find
[26:33] that uh uh Peter persistently knocked on
[26:38] the door and they found that it was
[26:40] truly Peter.
[26:43] Hallelujah. The Lord answered their
[26:45] prayer. Amen. Amen. This is prayer
[26:48] meeting. I understand. Amen. You have
[26:50] prayer requests tonight. Right. I'm here
[26:52] to tell you the Lord is going to answer
[26:54] your prayer. Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:01] But
[27:02] uh what I meant to show you in these
[27:05] verses was that uh the the Jewish the
[27:10] the Hebrew people Next slide please.
[27:18] They
[27:20] thought that that young sister saw
[27:23] Peter's angel.
[27:25] And some people take this to mean
[27:28] guardian
[27:32] angels. Like uh when I was one and a
[27:35] half year old, I fell off the window. I
[27:38] was playing uh with a a flower
[27:41] pot. Uh flower on a on a pot, right? uh
[27:46] in in the in our ancestral home in the
[27:49] province and I fell up the window 15
[27:52] feet. Wow. Uh onto a concrete pavement
[27:58] and uh
[28:01] um I was unconscious when my uh
[28:04] grandfather picked me up and they rushed
[28:08] me to the hospital
[28:10] on a carabal cart. The buggy. Oh, no. Uh
[28:16] uh carbal. It's a carbal. A water
[28:18] buffalo.
[28:20] Instead of a horse, we're using a wa a
[28:23] water
[28:24] buffalo. And it took me forever to reach
[28:28] the hospital. But before I even reached
[28:31] the hospital, I came too and I was I
[28:33] seem to be all right. But then my dad my
[28:37] grandfather uh uh uh wanted me to be
[28:42] thoroughly checked. they to to have an
[28:44] X-ray and back then, you know, it took a
[28:47] long time for the X-ray results to be to
[28:51] come back and but but but they waited
[28:53] because my grandfather wanted to make
[28:56] sure that I was all right. And when the
[29:00] uh when the results came back, here's
[29:03] what the do doctor told my grandfather.
[29:06] Your son uh your
[29:08] grandson, you're going to have a
[29:11] grandchild by him. Amen.
[29:15] Because the X-ray turned perfectly all
[29:18] right. There was nothing wrong. No
[29:20] fracture.
[29:21] Nothing wrong. I fell 15 feet.
[29:25] Hallelujah. Onto a concrete pavement.
[29:29] And people talked about it. They they
[29:32] even talked about it now.
[29:34] But they said, "I had a guardian angel
[29:39] that kept me safe. Maybe it caught me.
[29:42] That's right. Hallelujah. I know one
[29:45] thing. I have a theophony.
[29:49] Hallelujah. So in the Jewish in the
[29:52] Hebrew mind, Peter had an angel that
[29:55] looked like him.
[29:58] This was their concept. He had an angel
[30:01] that looked like him. That's why they
[30:02] saw they told the young sister, "It
[30:06] wasn't Peter. You saw you saw his
[30:08] angel." Yeah. Right.
[30:10] See So the Jews evidently had a concept
[30:14] of people's angel. People have angels
[30:18] that look like them. Yeah.
[30:24] These in actuality are supernatural
[30:27] bodies in which souls of the saved go to
[30:31] in death.
[30:34] Hallelujah. After you die and you leave
[30:36] this earthly body, you go to another
[30:38] body. Yeah. And that's if you're saved.
[30:43] And theophanes are commonly mistaken for
[30:46] ghosts. Yeah. Right. Because they're
[30:49] they appear to be doubles.
[30:52] People talk about doubles. Yeah. And and
[30:55] and and they think they're
[30:57] ghosts. Hallelujah. In Matthew chapter
[31:00] 18 verse
[31:02] 10, God's children have angels. Yeah.
[31:08] Let's look at this scripture. Matthew
[31:11] 18:10. Take heed that you despise not
[31:14] one of these little ones. Talking about
[31:16] the children of God.
[31:19] For I say unto you that in heaven their
[31:22] angels do always behold the face of my
[31:25] father which is in heaven. Amen.
[31:30] As we sit here
[31:32] tonight, our angels
[31:36] are in heavenly places.
[31:43] Hallelujah. They are beholding the face
[31:46] of the father in heaven. Our angels
[31:50] congregate in the presence of the father
[31:53] in heaven.
[31:55] Hallelujah. Right.
[31:58] Calls it our representation in heaven.
[32:01] Right. Hallelujah. It's like it's just
[32:04] like every country has a a lawmaking
[32:08] body or uh a congress or a senate.
[32:11] Right. Uh in a week all the citizens are
[32:15] represented in that congress. Amen.
[32:18] Hallelujah. That's why we have
[32:21] congressmen and senators to represent
[32:24] us.
[32:25] Hallelujah. I'm so glad that we have a
[32:27] congress in heaven. And each of us are
[32:31] represented in that congress.
[32:33] Hallelujah. Meaning all that we need of
[32:37] all our cares in this life, all our
[32:40] troubles, all our problems, hallelujah,
[32:43] are being communicated to our father in
[32:45] heaven. Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:49] You believe that our needs are being
[32:52] represented in heaven. Amen. Even as we
[32:55] sit in this assembly tonight.
[32:57] Hallelujah. We have angels. Hallelujah.
[33:00] That behold that behold the face of the
[33:03] father in heaven. These angels are our
[33:07] theophanies.
[33:10] Hallelujah.
[33:16] Next slide. Brother talks about our
[33:19] representation in heaven.
[33:21] Jehovah Gyra in 1964. He said, "And now
[33:24] we notice no matter what the others
[33:28] done, how they walked away, those
[33:32] disciples were predestinated, right?
[33:35] They were ordained to eternal life. No,
[33:40] they couldn't explain
[33:41] it. They could not explain everything."
[33:45] No. That's right. Huh? And that's why
[33:48] you don't expect me as a believer to be
[33:50] able to explain everything in a message.
[33:54] Hallelujah. There are things that we
[33:56] don't understand.
[33:58] Hallelujah.
[34:01] But there was something in them.
[34:05] Re said that representation in heaven.
[34:08] Exactly. Hallelujah. A thought that God
[34:12] had of them before the foundation of the
[34:14] world had manifested itself here and
[34:18] they were connected with God.
[34:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. That's our
[34:24] connection with God. Our theophony is
[34:27] our connection with God.
[34:31] Hallelujah. Of course, not all people
[34:32] have theophonies. Right? That's the
[34:35] reason not everyone has a connection,
[34:38] right? Hallelujah. with God. And that's
[34:41] the reason not everyone can understand
[34:43] the word. Correct?
[34:46] Hallelujah.
[34:49] Only those that have a representation in
[34:52] heaven, they can have a revelation.
[34:55] Right? Hallelujah.
[34:58] Because this representation is a thought
[35:00] that God had of you before the
[35:02] foundation of the world.
[35:04] Let me put it this way. It was like God
[35:07] took a picture of you. What said before
[35:10] the foundation of the world, before time
[35:13] even began, God took a picture of you,
[35:17] it it was uh what he had in mind of you
[35:21] etern in eternity.
[35:23] Hallelujah. That's your eternal form.
[35:27] Hallelujah.
[35:29] And your eternal form that is what you
[35:32] are going into.
[35:34] Hallelujah.
[35:36] When he took a picture of you before the
[35:38] foundation of the world, it was a
[35:39] perfect picture.
[35:42] Amen. Hallelujah. That picture, that
[35:45] image, hallelujah, is not smoking. Amen.
[35:49] That image is not weak and has arthritis
[35:53] or cancer or diabetes.
[35:56] Hallelujah. It was a perfect form. It
[36:00] was a perfect image. It was a perfect
[36:02] body.
[36:04] Hallelujah. eternal in the heavens. It
[36:07] was a thought that God had of them
[36:10] before the foundation of the world that
[36:12] had manifested itself here. And they
[36:15] were connected with God and were sure uh
[36:19] that that that was God's promise
[36:22] vindicated and nothing's going to change
[36:24] it from them. That's real genuine
[36:28] Christianity.
[36:29] Amen. Whatever God says we simply
[36:32] believe. Exactly. Hallelujah. And
[36:35] nothing can change that. Change that.
[36:38] Nothing can take that revelation away
[36:40] from us. Hallelujah. Not even believe
[36:43] the sign.
[36:47] That's where they got it wrong because
[36:48] they were believing the sign. The
[36:50] prophet did not say believe the sign. He
[36:53] said believe the voice behind the sign.
[36:56] Hallelujah. They took the sign that they
[36:58] forget about the voice.
[37:01] Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[37:04] They took the sign but not the the not
[37:06] the theophony.
[37:08] Not the logos.
[37:11] Hallelujah.
[37:17] Next identified Christ of all the ages.
[37:20] But Baron said this. Look at the little
[37:23] woman. See, she had fallen from God's
[37:27] thoughts and she she could be redeemed.
[37:32] Right. She was a subject.
[37:36] Hallelujah. If you came from God's
[37:38] thoughts, you become subject to God.
[37:42] Hallelujah.
[37:44] She was a
[37:45] subject. But said she had
[37:49] representation in heaven.
[37:52] Hallelujah. She turned
[37:55] around. Look at the difference between
[37:57] her and them preachers or priests.
[37:59] Right. Right. There's a difference
[38:01] between this woman who people thought to
[38:05] be lowly. She was a a prostitute.
[38:09] Hallelujah. But there was a difference
[38:11] between her and those clergy people.
[38:15] Hallelujah. Them preachers when they saw
[38:18] it, they said, "Why? This man is a
[38:20] fortune teller." Why? Because they did
[38:23] not know the word. Right. Exactly. When
[38:26] the woman saw it, he said, "We know that
[38:31] when the Messiah cometh, he will do the
[38:34] things that you're doing." Hallelujah.
[38:37] You're the Messiah.
[38:40] Hallelujah. See the difference? The
[38:42] woman said, "You're the Messiah." Why?
[38:44] Because he had connections with God. He
[38:47] She had a representation in heaven.
[38:50] Hallelujah. And these clerics, they did
[38:52] not know the word.
[38:54] Hallelujah. Of course, they know the
[38:56] letter of the word.
[38:58] Perhaps this woman did not know anything
[39:01] about the Torah.
[39:03] Hallelujah. But these Pharisees, they
[39:06] knew the word. But Bam said they did not
[39:09] know the word.
[39:11] What he meant by that is that he they
[39:13] did not know the logos.
[39:16] Hallelujah. Because the logos is the
[39:19] thought behind the spoken word.
[39:23] Hallelujah. So you can be a master of
[39:26] the spoken of the written word without
[39:29] understanding the thought that is behind
[39:31] the word that's being spoken.
[39:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Two persons can be
[39:37] hearing the same sermon.
[39:40] Hallelujah. One goes out sour and the
[39:43] other one goes out rejoicing.
[39:46] Hallelujah. Like two per two persons can
[39:49] hear the same tape and one thinks
[39:52] brother Benham says he's an eagle and
[39:54] the other the next person thinks he's
[39:57] bann is saying he's a chicken.
[40:00] Hallelujah. Why is that? Hallelujah. You
[40:04] you need to catch the thought behind the
[40:06] word that was spoken.
[40:08] Hallelujah. And the thought behind the
[40:10] word that is the logos.
[40:13] The true meaning of the word the true
[40:15] idea
[40:17] and not some man's idea but God's idea
[40:19] about the spoken word.
[40:22] Hallelujah.
[40:24] I'm so glad that I have representation
[40:26] in heaven. Just like this woman. He had
[40:29] she had the representation in heaven and
[40:32] she recognized hallelujah.
[40:35] Hallelujah. The Messiah for her day.
[40:38] Amen.
[40:40] The others they said
[40:44] that's Bel Sabab
[40:46] Belub.
[40:49] Hallelujah. This man's a fortune teller.
[40:54] Next slide,
[40:55] please. The Jewish concept of the angel
[40:59] of the Lord is
[41:01] this. The Lord has an angel that looks
[41:04] like
[41:06] him. Clear?
[41:09] Hallelujah. It's a supernatural body
[41:13] where he lives
[41:15] in. From time to time in the Bible, he
[41:18] manifests himself to human beings
[41:21] through this body. Yeah.
[41:26] The theologians know this to be a
[41:29] temporary manifestation of God. Right.
[41:32] When you talk theophony, theophonyist to
[41:36] theologians, they're thinking so
[41:39] different from what we understand
[41:42] theopony to mean. Right. Right.
[41:44] Hallelujah.
[41:45] Well, to them, it's a temporary
[41:48] manifestation of God. To us, it's an
[41:52] eternal body. Right. Amen. Hallelujah.
[41:55] Amen. Of course uh uh they they can be
[41:59] right in a way
[42:01] because said theophony is the logos and
[42:05] the logos is created.
[42:09] Everything came out of that logos.
[42:12] Hallelujah.
[42:14] Amen. Whatever that logus speaks it it
[42:18] it came to be. Right. Right. Hallelujah.
[42:22] So the logos can speak
[42:25] fire and fire will be created. It will
[42:30] come to existence and God can use that
[42:33] fire to manifest himself. Amen. Like
[42:37] Moses saw the Lord in a burning bush.
[42:41] That's right. Hallelujah.
[42:43] God could speak the logos could speak
[42:47] and cloud uh cloud will be created.
[42:51] Amen. And God can use that same cloud to
[42:55] manifest himself.
[42:57] That's why uh in the Exodus, God
[43:01] manifested as a pillar of cloud during
[43:03] the day and a pillar of fire during the
[43:06] night. Hallelujah. These are temporary.
[43:09] They say temporary manifestations of God
[43:13] because that logos can create anything
[43:16] and God can can use that creation to
[43:19] manifest himself. Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:26] Let's look at Genesis
[43:28] 3:8. It says, "And they heard the voice
[43:32] of God walking in the garden in the cool
[43:36] of the day."
[43:39] Have you ever seen a voice walking?
[43:42] Yeah.
[43:45] But this is no ordinary voice. Right?
[43:50] This is God's presence. Amen. This is
[43:52] the voice of the Lord God. This is the
[43:54] logos,
[43:56] the word itself, the Lord of God walking
[44:00] in the garden of the cool in the cool of
[44:01] the day. And Adam and his five hid
[44:04] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[44:06] God amongst the trees of the garden.
[44:10] Brother Brenon when he made an
[44:13] exposition of this verse says this was
[44:15] the presence of the Lord. This was the
[44:17] logos. Amen. It was uh it was uh
[44:21] actually a a physical presence.
[44:26] From which Adam and Eve could hide
[44:28] themselves from.
[44:31] Hallelujah. It was a form.
[44:34] It was a bodily form that has legs.
[44:36] That's why it's walking. Amen.
[44:39] Hallelujah. It wasn't just a voice.
[44:42] Hallelujah. But it was the logos, the
[44:44] form of God. Amen. in the form of a
[44:47] human being walking and fellowshipping
[44:50] with the children of God, Adam and Eve.
[44:53] And after they fell in sin, hallelujah,
[44:56] they started hiding from the presence of
[44:59] the Lord. Right? Hallelujah.
[45:03] Next
[45:04] slide. Mo Moses saw the back parts of a
[45:08] man. Right? In Exodus chapter 33 22-23
[45:14] it says and it shall come to pass God
[45:16] was talking to Moses Moses while my
[45:19] glory passes by that I will put thee in
[45:22] a cliff of a rock and I will cover thee
[45:25] with my hand while I pass by and I will
[45:29] take away my hand and thou shalt see my
[45:32] back back parts but my face shall not be
[45:37] seen.
[45:40] If you look at my back parts, this was
[45:44] exactly what Moses saw. The back parts
[45:47] of a
[45:48] man sir. Hallelujah.
[45:52] So what did Moses do? Moses see the
[45:57] theophony of God.
[46:01] Amen. Gideon saw the angel of the Lord.
[46:05] Right. Hallelujah. Remember the concept
[46:08] of the of the Hebrews, God has an angel
[46:12] that look like God
[46:16] in in Judges 6:12 and also in verse 22
[46:21] it says here and the angel of the Lord
[46:24] appeared
[46:25] is something that can appear and
[46:28] disappear. Right? Hallelujah. So the
[46:30] angel of the Lord appeared and said unto
[46:33] him, the Lord is with thee, thou mighty
[46:35] man of valor.
[46:37] And when Gideon perceived that he was an
[46:40] angel of the Lord, now take note of that
[46:45] phrase, the angel of the Lord. Gideon
[46:48] said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I
[46:52] have seen an angel of the Lord face to
[46:55] face." He was thinking he was he was
[46:57] going to die, right? Because he saw the
[47:00] angel of the Lord face to face. What he
[47:02] saw was a theophony. Right. God's
[47:05] theophony.
[47:07] Hallelujah. And Jacob even wrestled with
[47:10] the angel of the Lord. This was
[47:12] something that one could grapple with,
[47:15] something that Jacob could touch,
[47:18] and wrestle with. Hallelujah.
[47:22] Just like a man would wrestle
[47:24] against a fellow human being.
[47:28] Verse 24. And Jacob was left alone and
[47:32] there wrestled with a man with him until
[47:36] the breaking of day. And when he saw
[47:40] that he prevailed not against him who
[47:43] prevailed not against him, it was the
[47:46] angel of the Lord not be not not being
[47:49] able to prevail against Jacob.
[47:53] Think about it.
[47:55] Hallelujah.
[47:57] Jacob
[47:59] was the only man I know that wrestled
[48:02] against God and won.
[48:07] Exactly. Hallelujah. And he saw when he
[48:10] saw that he prevailed not against him.
[48:14] It was a physical battle, a physical
[48:17] struggle. He touched the hollow of his
[48:20] thigh. God touched the angel of the
[48:22] Lord. God touched the hollow of his
[48:24] thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh
[48:26] was out of joint as he wrestled with
[48:30] him.
[48:31] And you would think Jacob would let go
[48:33] then. No, no, not Jacob. And he said,
[48:37] "Let me go." After he disjointed the the
[48:41] uh the the tie of uh Jacob, for they
[48:46] break it. And Jacob said, he said, "I
[48:49] will not let me let thee go except thou
[48:52] bless me." Oh my. Look at this verse.
[48:57] Look at a man imposing his will upon the
[49:00] angel of the Lord.
[49:03] Hallelujah.
[49:05] Of course, we understand this was God
[49:07] trying Jacob, right? This was God trying
[49:12] to see how desperate Jacob was, right?
[49:16] Did he really want the blessing? Yeah.
[49:19] Hallelujah.
[49:21] And Jacob did everything to get the the
[49:24] uh uh what's that? The the birthright,
[49:27] right? And the blessing of his p father,
[49:30] right? Hallelujah. But more than that,
[49:32] he wanted the blessing of God.
[49:36] Hallelujah. He knew there was nothing he
[49:39] could do. Hallelujah. Without the
[49:41] blessing of God. Amen. And there's
[49:44] nothing you can do without the baptism
[49:46] of the Holy Spirit. That's right.
[49:49] Hallelujah.
[49:52] And sometimes God is just testing our
[49:54] wills.
[49:55] Hallelujah. Can we can we get by without
[49:58] the baptism of the Holy Spirit? Do you
[50:01] think Do you really think you can
[50:03] survive without God's blessing in your
[50:05] life?
[50:08] Do you really think you can make it to
[50:09] the rapture without the baptism of the
[50:12] Holy Spirit?
[50:14] Hallelujah. Right. So I believe just
[50:17] like Jacob, we need to be perseverant.
[50:21] We need to be desperate.
[50:24] Hallelujah. And not let go of God.
[50:27] Tonight you can get a hold of God and
[50:29] not let him go unless he bless you.
[50:33] Hallelujah. Impose your will upon God.
[50:36] Right? Hallelujah.
[50:39] If you're one of this, Hallelujah.
[50:41] You'll find out that your will it will
[50:43] not be contrary to God's will. Right.
[50:47] That God is just testing your will
[50:50] sometimes. Sure. Amen. It's testing your
[50:53] faith, your revelation.
[50:56] Do you really believe this? Do you
[50:58] really believe that it's for you today?
[51:01] God's blessing, the baptism of the Holy
[51:03] Spirit is still for you today. Amen.
[51:06] Hallelujah.
[51:08] Amen. Right.
[51:11] Sometimes he works in our
[51:15] circumstances to disjoint our lives. Oh
[51:18] yeah. Right.
[51:20] But what do we do after he disjoints
[51:24] our lives and frustrates our plans?
[51:29] Do we give up?
[51:31] Are we like Jacob? No. I won't let you
[51:34] go unless you bless me. Right. Amen. Oh
[51:37] my. Amen. So this was something physical
[51:40] that Jacob could hold on to could
[51:44] grapple with.
[51:46] Hallelujah. I told my people God
[51:49] actually tapped out on Jacob.
[51:53] [Laughter]
[51:56] Okay, Jacob. I bless you now. Now let me
[51:58] go.
[52:01] Hallelujah. God tapped out on Jacob.
[52:05] Hallelujah.
[52:06] And he said, "Let me go for the day
[52:08] breakth." And he said, "I will not let
[52:10] go let thee go except thou bless me."
[52:14] Now we go to the mighty angel of
[52:16] Revelations
[52:17] 10. The mighty angel of Revelations 10
[52:21] is no ordinary angel.
[52:26] It is the Lord himself.
[52:29] Amen.
[52:32] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[52:34] from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
[52:38] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[52:40] was as it were a son, the sun, and his
[52:44] feet as pillars of fire, glorious,
[52:46] right?
[52:48] And he had in his hand a little book
[52:50] open, and he set his right foot upon the
[52:54] sea, and his left foot on the earth.
[52:57] Right?
[52:59] We need to be familiar next slide with
[53:01] Bible
[53:03] terminology. When you come across the
[53:05] expression the angel of the
[53:08] Lord, it could mean the very person of
[53:11] the Lord or the Lord himself. Right?
[53:15] Amen. The angel of the Lord could mean
[53:17] the Lord himself. Think about it. Amen.
[53:21] Hallelujah. Right. Amen. Next slide.
[53:27] That's a rec reason we can say he is
[53:29] here.
[53:32] Who? The Lord Jesus Christ is here.
[53:35] Amen.
[53:37] Hallelujah. Right. Yes, sir. Why?
[53:41] Because he is the word. Amen. He is the
[53:44] low God. Amen. He's the theophony
[53:48] of God. Hallelujah. The angel of the
[53:51] Lord. Hallelujah. We're waiting for his
[53:54] glorified body to come, but he has
[53:56] already descended to earth to open the
[53:59] seals. Think about it.
[54:03] There was a presence in brother Ben's
[54:06] study.
[54:08] There was somebody there.
[54:11] Hallelujah. Was the angel of the Lord.
[54:15] Hallelujah.
[54:16] I believe it was the lamb of God. Oh
[54:19] yeah. The very person of the Lord Jesus
[54:22] Christ, right telling me that's wrong.
[54:25] What the what the theologians,
[54:27] the com commentary of of of Bible
[54:31] scholars that brother Brennham searchs
[54:33] out and and he wrote it down in his
[54:36] notes and he was ready to preach that
[54:39] the white horse rider was was Christ
[54:42] himself. Turned out to be the
[54:44] antichrist.
[54:47] Hallelujah. But somebody told him inside
[54:49] that study.
[54:51] Hallelujah. Right. I believe it's the
[54:54] same one that picked him up and said,
[54:55] "Go back to Jeffersonville."
[54:58] Hallelujah. To preach the mystery of the
[54:59] seals.
[55:01] Hallelujah.
[55:03] So we can say he is here. Amen. Amen.
[55:06] And yet we're we're waiting for his
[55:08] coming.
[55:12] We're waiting for his corporal body to
[55:14] come. Amen. But he has descended already
[55:16] in theophony form.
[55:19] Oh my. Hallelujah. That's right. Thank
[55:22] you, Jesus. Amen. Let's talk about the
[55:24] angel of
[55:26] Exodus. Exodus 23:20. Behold, I send an
[55:30] angel before thee. This is God speaking
[55:32] to Moses. Behold, I send an angel before
[55:36] thee to keep thee in the way, and to
[55:38] bring thee into the place which I have
[55:41] prepared. Amen.
[55:44] Hallelujah. And you click on the word
[55:46] angel and uh the Hebrew word used there
[55:51] was mollock meaning messenger,
[55:55] a representative.
[55:57] A messenger, an angel. I like this last
[56:01] uh uh definition. The theophonyic angel.
[56:06] Hallelujah. An angel with a bodily form.
[56:11] Hallelujah.
[56:13] Hallelujah. The angel of the Lord was
[56:16] the Lord himself in this case.
[56:19] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Now, who
[56:22] is this angel? Next slide. Who is this
[56:25] angel? Exodus
[56:27] 23:1. Now, the Bible gives us a hint of
[56:30] who this angel is. Beware of him. God is
[56:32] saying, "Beware of this angel. Obey his
[56:36] voice. Provoke him not for he will not
[56:40] pardon your
[56:41] transgressions for my name is in him.
[56:45] Amen. This angel bears my name and he
[56:49] forgives sins.
[56:51] Hallelujah.
[56:54] Hallelujah. If you aggravate him, he may
[56:56] not forgive your sins. Verse 22. If thou
[57:00] shalt indeed obey o obey his voice and
[57:03] do all that I speak, then I will be an
[57:06] enemy to your enemies and an adversary
[57:09] unto thine adversaries.
[57:16] Hallelujah. But only God can forgive
[57:18] sins.
[57:20] Hallelujah. Luke 7, look at this verse
[57:23] verse 48 and 49. He said unto her, "Thy
[57:26] sins are forgiven." The Lord Jesus was
[57:29] speaking to this woman, "Thy sins are
[57:32] forgiven." And they that they that sat
[57:36] at me with him began to say within
[57:38] themselves, "Who is this man? Who is
[57:40] this that forgiveth sins also?" Yeah.
[57:45] They only know one, right? Who can
[57:48] forgive sins? Oh yeah. But Jesus said,
[57:51] "Your sins are forgiven."
[57:54] [Laughter]
[57:56] Hallelujah. startling statement and the
[57:58] people that sat at meet with him were
[58:00] thinking who is this that can forgive
[58:03] sins also.
[58:05] [Laughter]
[58:07] So they knew only God can forgive sins.
[58:11] Hallelujah. But the fact that Jesus
[58:12] forgave sins on earth proved that he was
[58:16] deity. Amen. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. Amen.
[58:20] Amen.
[58:22] Markapter
[58:24] 2:7. Why does this man speak
[58:27] blasphemies? People thought he was
[58:29] blaspheming God, Jesus. Who can forgive
[58:33] sins but God only? Right?
[58:37] So it's not that there was a God that
[58:39] can forgive sins and there was an angel
[58:42] who can forgive sins also.
[58:45] No, only God can forgive sins.
[58:49] But this God can manifest himself in a
[58:52] body. The angel of the Lord, hallelujah.
[58:56] And Moses was com commanded to be
[59:00] mindful of this angel. Hallelujah.
[59:03] Because he will not forgive your sins.
[59:05] If you disobey, he will not forgive you.
[59:09] Hallelujah. So who is this angel that
[59:11] forgiveth sins also? It must be the very
[59:15] person of God himself. Amen. Hallelujah.
[59:20] What about the angel that led
[59:22] Eleazar? Genesis
[59:25] 24:7. The Lord God of heaven which took
[59:28] me from my father's house. This was
[59:31] Eleazar speaking. And from the land of
[59:33] my kindred and uh oh no, this was
[59:36] Abraham speaking. And from the land of
[59:38] my kindred which spake unto me and that
[59:41] swear unto me, saying unto thy seed will
[59:44] I give this land. He shall send his
[59:46] angel before thee.
[59:49] Don't worry,
[59:51] Eleazar, you'll find a girl, right?
[59:54] Because God will send his angel before
[59:58] you and thou shalt take a wife unto my
[1:00:01] son from then.
[1:00:04] Hallelujah. God had to send an angel to
[1:00:07] guide Eleer to find a bride. Hallelujah.
[1:00:11] For Isa. Right. In the same way, I
[1:00:14] believe God sent an angel to guide
[1:00:16] brother Venom.
[1:00:18] Hallelujah. To lead him to the bride of
[1:00:21] Christ in this day. Hallelujah.
[1:00:24] It's not by accident that we got to hear
[1:00:27] the message of the hour.
[1:00:30] God had already planned it. Hallelujah.
[1:00:34] He did it by an angel.
[1:00:37] Hallelujah.
[1:00:38] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:00:42] Look at Ephesians chapter
[1:00:45] 2:6. It says here, "He has raised us up
[1:00:48] together and make us sit together in
[1:00:51] heavenly places in Christ
[1:00:54] Jesus." Even as we sit here in Lula,
[1:00:57] Georgia, there's a part of us that's
[1:01:00] already sitting in heavenly places in
[1:01:02] Christ. Amen.
[1:01:05] Which part of us do you think it is?
[1:01:09] Hallelujah. Our earthly bodies are here
[1:01:12] in Lula, Georgia. But our theophonies,
[1:01:15] hallelujah, are sitting in heavenly
[1:01:17] places in Christ.
[1:01:20] You believe that? That's our
[1:01:22] representation.
[1:01:23] We are represented in heaven. Oh, I'm so
[1:01:25] glad.
[1:01:28] I'm so thankful that we have a
[1:01:30] representation in heaven. Hallelujah. In
[1:01:33] the case of Revelations 10:1, the Lord's
[1:01:36] corporal body, the lamb, remained seated
[1:01:38] on the throne. Hallelujah. In heaven.
[1:01:41] But his
[1:01:42] theophony came down to open the seals.
[1:01:46] Does that make sense?
[1:01:50] That's why we can say he is here, but
[1:01:51] we're still waiting for him to come.
[1:01:54] Hallelujah.
[1:01:55] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:02:01] Now look here. John heard from his
[1:02:05] theophony.
[1:02:07] I believe John heard from his theophony.
[1:02:10] He was weeping. He was crying. He was
[1:02:13] very sad because no one was found worthy
[1:02:16] to open the book. But then there was
[1:02:19] somebody who spoke up. We read in verse
[1:02:23] five, one of the elders. Yeah. said unto
[1:02:27] me, "Weep not. Behold, the lion of the
[1:02:32] tribe of Judah, the root of David, has
[1:02:35] prevailed to open the book, and lose the
[1:02:38] seven seals thereof,"
[1:02:41] which made John jump for joy. his mood
[1:02:46] changed suddenly
[1:02:48] from weeping to rejoicing.
[1:02:51] Matter of fact, brother Benam when he
[1:02:52] when he uh uh uh described what
[1:02:55] happened, he said all the angels that
[1:02:57] was crying day and night holy and and
[1:02:59] and and praising God. Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] unceasingly their praises were drowned
[1:03:07] by the praises of John who said blessing
[1:03:10] and honor and riches and glory to the
[1:03:13] one hallelujah who who is who is uh uh
[1:03:18] worthy to open the book hallelujah
[1:03:24] just like the church John types the
[1:03:26] church hallelujah when the book was
[1:03:29] still closed and sealed he was crying.
[1:03:34] He was very sad.
[1:03:37] But when he found that that there was
[1:03:39] somebody that was worthy to open the
[1:03:42] book, right? Hallelujah. I like what
[1:03:45] brother Ron said during the
[1:03:46] meetings. We are the people of the open
[1:03:51] book.
[1:03:55] Hallelujah.
[1:03:57] Denominational preachers, they use the
[1:03:59] same book that we use. Yeah, but they're
[1:04:02] preaching from a closed book.
[1:04:04] Hallelujah. When you when you read and
[1:04:06] preach from a closed book, what do the
[1:04:08] people get? Nothing.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah.
[1:04:13] But we are the people of the open book.
[1:04:16] Hallelujah.
[1:04:18] And we like John should be rejoicing.
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. One of the elders said,
[1:04:24] "Weep not, John." Hallelujah. Have you
[1:04:27] ever wondered who this iller
[1:04:30] was? Theophony is the logos. In the
[1:04:33] beginning was the word and that word
[1:04:36] there was actually logos.
[1:04:40] The beginning was the word or the logos
[1:04:43] or the theophony
[1:04:45] and the word was with God and the word
[1:04:47] was God. The same was in the beginning
[1:04:49] with God and all things were made by him
[1:04:51] and without him was anything made was
[1:04:54] not anything made that was made.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. And brother Bellam speaks
[1:05:00] about King theophony.
[1:05:03] Hallelujah. Amen. I have a theophony.
[1:05:07] Amen. Butter Wade has one. But Sam has
[1:05:10] one. You have one.
[1:05:13] Hallelujah. But this is King Theophony.
[1:05:16] Yeah. Hallelujah. Amen. It's God's
[1:05:19] theophony.
[1:05:21] Now, since he has come in the flesh and
[1:05:23] receive his body up, Revelation 21:16,
[1:05:26] he's called the King of Kings. He's all
[1:05:29] three of them together. See, King God,
[1:05:32] King Theophony,
[1:05:34] King Jesus, he's the King of Kings. It's
[1:05:38] all met just like soul, body, and spirit
[1:05:42] all comes to make one. Right.
[1:05:45] So the word in John 1 verse one was King
[1:05:50] Theophony.
[1:05:52] Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] From which all things came from.
[1:05:56] Hallelujah. And were created. All things
[1:05:59] were created by him and for him.
[1:06:03] Hallelujah.
[1:06:04] And in in in John chapter 20 verse two,
[1:06:08] look at this characteristic way of John
[1:06:12] writing a book and not mentioning his
[1:06:15] name in the book. Right? John wrote the
[1:06:18] book of Gospel of St. John. Right? He's
[1:06:21] the he was the author of the Gospel of
[1:06:23] St. John. But every time he mentions his
[1:06:27] character, he says this. Then she runth
[1:06:30] and cometh to Simon Peter and to the
[1:06:32] other disciple, no name mentioned. Yeah.
[1:06:35] Whom Jesus loved. Of course, he was
[1:06:38] referring to himself.
[1:06:41] Think of it. He writes a book. And he
[1:06:44] doesn't even mention his name in the
[1:06:46] book. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. I wonder
[1:06:49] about preachers in the message who like
[1:06:51] writing books
[1:06:55] and their names are bigger than brother
[1:06:57] Benham or bigger than Jesus Christ.
[1:07:01] Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] Now this is the character of John.
[1:07:05] Right? Who writes a book and doesn't
[1:07:08] even want to mention his name in the
[1:07:10] book. Right.
[1:07:12] There was no insecurity in him.
[1:07:15] He knew who he was. Hallelujah.
[1:07:18] He was the disciple whom Jesus loved.
[1:07:21] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:28] John 21:7 Therefore that disciple whom
[1:07:31] Jesus loved said unto Peter, it is the
[1:07:33] Lord.
[1:07:35] Now when Simon Peter heard that it was
[1:07:37] the Lord, he g his father's coat unto
[1:07:40] him, for he was naked and did cast
[1:07:42] himself into the sea. So every time he
[1:07:45] mentions his character, he doesn't
[1:07:48] mention his name. Right?
[1:07:51] In this next verse, John 21:20, then
[1:07:54] Peter turning about seeth the disciple
[1:07:56] whom Jesus loved following, which also
[1:07:59] leaned on his breast at supper, and
[1:08:01] said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth
[1:08:04] thee? Right. Hallelujah. It was like
[1:08:07] Peter was getting annoyed by this
[1:08:08] disciple.
[1:08:11] He was getting too close to the Lord.
[1:08:13] Yeah. Hey, I'm the supposed to be the
[1:08:15] oldest of all the apostles. I got the
[1:08:17] keys to the kingdom of heaven.
[1:08:20] What is this disciples doing? Leaning on
[1:08:23] the breast of the savior.
[1:08:30] Oh my.
[1:08:33] Yet John when referring to himself did
[1:08:38] not mention his name.
[1:08:41] Hallelujah.
[1:08:42] And we are told that the 24
[1:08:45] elders around the throne of God were the
[1:08:49] 12 patriarchs
[1:08:51] in the Old Testament and the 12 apostles
[1:08:56] in the New Testament.
[1:08:58] Hallelujah. Well, wasn't John one of the
[1:09:00] apostles? Right. And one of the elders
[1:09:04] told John, right? No mention of the
[1:09:07] name. Hallelujah. But I'm sure John
[1:09:10] heard from his theophony.
[1:09:14] Does that make sense?
[1:09:17] Ram said it.
[1:09:19] Who is this mechisedc? It says then
[1:09:22] after you recognize the very word of God
[1:09:25] was eagle food. He was talking about the
[1:09:28] message of the hour.
[1:09:30] Because we heard all kinds of
[1:09:32] theologies. Baptist theologies, Catholic
[1:09:34] theology, the Presbyterian, Methodist,
[1:09:37] Pentecostal theology. Hallelujah.
[1:09:40] And they were all right. But when you
[1:09:42] heard after you recognized the very word
[1:09:45] of God was eagle food, when you heard
[1:09:48] eagle food, then you left the other
[1:09:50] thing. You have then been formed into
[1:09:54] the living image of the living God. What
[1:09:57] happened? You actually heard from your
[1:10:00] theophony. Hallelujah.
[1:10:03] Where's your theophony? In heaven.
[1:10:06] Hallelujah. What was that theophony?
[1:10:09] Part of the log go.
[1:10:13] That was the picture God took of you
[1:10:16] before the foundation of the world. It
[1:10:19] was a perfect picture.
[1:10:21] It was an angel that represents you.
[1:10:25] Hallelujah. In heaven, sitting in
[1:10:28] heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[1:10:31] Hallelujah.
[1:10:33] What was that? It's part of the word.
[1:10:37] It's the word speaking.
[1:10:39] It tells you of your portion of the
[1:10:42] word.
[1:10:44] Hallelujah. Like Christ came in the
[1:10:46] volume of the book which was spoken of
[1:10:49] him. You have a volume in the book.
[1:10:53] Hallelujah. That was spoken of you. By
[1:10:56] what? By the logos.
[1:10:58] By King Theophony. Right. Hallelujah.
[1:11:01] This is the way I look at it.
[1:11:04] I take a p piece of paper and I call
[1:11:06] that king theophony
[1:11:09] and I I I tear it to pieces and the
[1:11:13] pieces are also theophies.
[1:11:16] Those are our theophonies.
[1:11:18] Our theophonies together make up the
[1:11:20] king theophony.
[1:11:22] You and I together coming together make
[1:11:24] up the word of God. The logos of God.
[1:11:28] Hallelujah. Right.
[1:11:30] That's why it excites me to hear better
[1:11:33] venom say your little lick of fire and
[1:11:35] my little lick of fire. We they come
[1:11:38] together. Hallelujah. He didn't say it
[1:11:40] this way. Hallelujah. But I think your
[1:11:43] little lick of fire with my little lick
[1:11:45] of fire together with others little lick
[1:11:48] of fire licks of fire forms the pillar
[1:11:50] of fire.
[1:11:53] That's right. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:11:58] You heard from your theophony
[1:12:00] and this if this earthly body be
[1:12:03] dissolved we have one waiting.
[1:12:06] Hallelujah. That's the reason no matter
[1:12:10] the difficulty the hardship hallelujah
[1:12:13] all the challenges that this body has to
[1:12:16] go through we still have hope in Christ.
[1:12:21] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:24] We can have our mind pop set on heavenly
[1:12:27] things.
[1:12:29] Set on the word,
[1:12:31] set on our theophony.
[1:12:34] Hallelujah.
[1:12:36] When brother Dale preaches, hallelujah.
[1:12:39] And you cut the revelation. What
[1:12:41] happened? You heard from your theophony.
[1:12:45] It's your theophony speaking back to
[1:12:47] you. Hallelujah.
[1:12:49] Thank you, Jesus. Glory. Please forgive
[1:12:51] me for being so excited.
[1:12:54] Hallelujah.
[1:12:58] Brother said, "We bypass our
[1:13:00] theophonyies."
[1:13:05] Who is this? Mechisedc. He said, "Now
[1:13:07] the difference between him and you as a
[1:13:10] son. He was at the beginning the word
[1:13:17] anorphy body. He came in and lived in
[1:13:21] that person of Melkisedc.
[1:13:24] And then later we never heard of no more
[1:13:26] of
[1:13:27] Mechisedc because he became Jesus
[1:13:30] Christ. Mechisedc was the priest and he
[1:13:34] became Jesus Christ.
[1:13:36] Now you bypass that
[1:13:40] because in that form he knowed all
[1:13:43] things and you have never been able to
[1:13:46] know that yet.
[1:13:48] You come like Adam, like me. Said you
[1:13:53] became from attribute to the flesh to be
[1:13:57] tempted.
[1:13:59] Here's what
[1:14:00] happened. This is a very attribute. This
[1:14:03] is our soul.
[1:14:05] Our souls are attributes of God.
[1:14:08] Hallelujah. And God meant for the soul
[1:14:11] to have a body like he had a body.
[1:14:13] Right? Hallelujah. And this is the
[1:14:16] theophony.
[1:14:18] This is our body.
[1:14:20] Okay. And and and the Lord Jesus, he
[1:14:24] came from
[1:14:25] attribute from spirit.
[1:14:28] He
[1:14:31] came he he came came into his
[1:14:35] theophony and then his theophony became
[1:14:38] flesh.
[1:14:41] From from this theophony he created a
[1:14:44] body of flesh.
[1:14:46] Hallelujah. And then he dwelt in that
[1:14:48] body. Right. Right.
[1:14:51] The eternal spirit, the theophony dwelt
[1:14:55] in the body, the fleshly body of the
[1:14:58] Lord Jesus Christ. But with us, with
[1:15:02] Adam, brother Benham likened himself to
[1:15:04] Adam. Here was Adam's attribute and he
[1:15:08] was supposed to go through his theophony
[1:15:12] but he bypassed that to go directly to
[1:15:16] the body of flesh.
[1:15:20] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:23] Because in this form B says you know all
[1:15:27] things.
[1:15:29] If you're tried you'll never fall.
[1:15:33] Why? Because you know you're omnisient
[1:15:35] in this form. That's why you had to
[1:15:38] bypass that and go directly to your
[1:15:41] fleshly bodies to be tried and tempted
[1:15:44] in this light.
[1:15:46] So we can fall in sin.
[1:15:50] Hallelujah. But praise God. Even in our
[1:15:54] fallen condition,
[1:15:56] our fleshly bodies may have fallen but
[1:15:59] our theophony is never. Yes. Right.
[1:16:02] Amen. Our theophonyies is still in its
[1:16:05] original states. Amen. In its original
[1:16:08] form, original image of God.
[1:16:12] Hallelujah. And it remains in the
[1:16:15] presence of almighty God. And that bea
[1:16:18] becomes our connection when we're after
[1:16:21] we're born again. Hallelujah. We become
[1:16:24] aware of our theophonies.
[1:16:28] Before convention, we don't even know
[1:16:30] that we have this. Right? We only mind
[1:16:34] earthly things. We don't think of
[1:16:36] heavenly things. Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] But after our convention, we don't mind
[1:16:41] earthly things anymore.
[1:16:44] We look at the things that are unseen.
[1:16:47] Amen. Hallelujah. We look at every
[1:16:49] promise of the word we have, God has for
[1:16:52] us. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:16:56] Now you bypass that because in that form
[1:16:59] he knowed all things. That's why Jesus
[1:17:01] did not fall in sin.
[1:17:05] Because he did not bypass his theophony.
[1:17:07] We did. Amen. Hallelujah. And you have
[1:17:10] never been able to know that yet.
[1:17:13] But hallelujah. You know this better
[1:17:15] said you have never been able to know
[1:17:17] that yet. Right. That means it's coming.
[1:17:21] Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] You come like Adam, like me. You become,
[1:17:28] you became from the attribute to the
[1:17:30] flesh to be tempted. But when this life
[1:17:34] is finished here, if this earthly
[1:17:36] tabernacle be dissolved, we have one
[1:17:39] already waiting.
[1:17:41] That's where we go to. That is the word.
[1:17:46] That is the logos. Amen. That is the
[1:17:50] theophony. Then we can look back and see
[1:17:52] what we've done. Now we don't understand
[1:17:55] it. We have never become the word. We
[1:17:59] just become the flesh man, not the word.
[1:18:03] And look clearly makes it clear to you.
[1:18:06] We'll never be the word unless you was a
[1:18:09] thought at the beginning. You see the
[1:18:12] insinuation. We will eventually we
[1:18:14] become the word. We are becoming the
[1:18:16] word
[1:18:19] and you can never become that unless you
[1:18:21] are a thought at the beginning. All
[1:18:22] right. That proves the predestination of
[1:18:26] God. You cannot be the word unless
[1:18:30] you're a thought. You had to be in the
[1:18:33] thinking first. But you see, in order to
[1:18:36] stand temptation, you had to bypass the
[1:18:40] theophony and you had to come down here
[1:18:43] in flesh to be tempted by sin. Amen. All
[1:18:48] that the father had given me will come
[1:18:51] to me and I will raise him up at the
[1:18:53] last day. See, you had to be first.
[1:18:58] Hallelujah. Before the foundation of the
[1:19:01] world, his name's put on the lamb's book
[1:19:04] of life. Then from that he become the
[1:19:07] word, the theophony that could appear,
[1:19:11] disappear, and then he become flesh and
[1:19:14] return back again. resurrected that same
[1:19:17] body in a glorified condition. But you
[1:19:20] bypass the theophony and became flesh
[1:19:23] man to be tempted by sin. Amen. It says
[1:19:26] it over and over again. You bypass your
[1:19:28] theophony to be tempted by sin. And then
[1:19:32] if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved,
[1:19:35] we have one already waiting. We have not
[1:19:38] yet the bodies. But look, when this body
[1:19:42] receives the spirit of God, the immortal
[1:19:46] life inside of you, it throws this body
[1:19:50] in subjection to God. Hallelujah.
[1:19:54] When you see the Holy Ghost, that
[1:19:56] immortal life inside of you, throws this
[1:19:58] earthly body in subjection to the word
[1:20:01] of God.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah. Next, we're we're closing by
[1:20:07] this. Jesus and us. Jesus Christ came
[1:20:11] from being an attribute soul to
[1:20:15] theophony to human flesh. Adam and the
[1:20:19] believer came from being an attribute
[1:20:21] which is soul to human
[1:20:24] flesh. They both came in a body of flesh
[1:20:26] to be tempted by
[1:20:28] sin. Hallelujah. What's the difference?
[1:20:31] Jesus overcame. Jesus knowing all things
[1:20:36] overcame. Adam with his limited
[1:20:38] knowledge fell. Right? We too fell
[1:20:42] because be like Adam, we bypass our
[1:20:45] theophony. But we've always felt a tug
[1:20:48] in the inside that calls us to a better
[1:20:51] life.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah. The tug within us. Oh, he
[1:20:57] done
[1:20:58] something. He done had something moving
[1:21:00] in his heart.
[1:21:02] If you ever get it moving in your heart,
[1:21:05] you won't care who tries to stop you.
[1:21:08] That's right. If God begins to tug at
[1:21:11] your heart and you begin to move with
[1:21:13] that tug, there ain't nothing in the
[1:21:16] world in in in in that's in hell going
[1:21:20] to hold you down. You are going anyhow.
[1:21:24] Hallelujah. All that the father has
[1:21:26] given me will come and no man can come
[1:21:29] except my father draws him. So there you
[1:21:32] are. You feel a tug at your heart. I'm
[1:21:36] asking you as a Christian brother. If it
[1:21:37] is raise to your feet and say I want you
[1:21:40] to pray for me, brother Ben better.
[1:21:44] Hallelujah. Your soul connects with your
[1:21:48] theophony. Your soul is
[1:21:51] yearning. You are not in your right
[1:21:54] place.
[1:21:55] Hallelujah. You are groaning in this
[1:21:58] body, waiting for the redemption of your
[1:22:01] body. There is a redemption of our body.
[1:22:03] We're waiting for our body change.
[1:22:06] Hallelujah. What a promise. What an
[1:22:10] absolute promise. Better bam says it is
[1:22:12] to believe in Christ and to to have my
[1:22:16] heart say amen to every word that is in
[1:22:19] his book. You can say amen to every word
[1:22:23] because you are part of the word.
[1:22:26] Exactly. Hallelujah.
[1:22:29] He was the logus that came logos came
[1:22:31] out that came out of God and you are
[1:22:34] part of that logos.
[1:22:37] Hallelujah. You've got to be
[1:22:40] born,
[1:22:42] regenerated, baptized with the Holy
[1:22:44] Ghost into Jesus Christ, quickened to
[1:22:47] every word. Your spirit in you will
[1:22:51] punctuate amen to every word of the
[1:22:54] Bible
[1:22:56] because you're part of the word.
[1:22:58] Hallelujah. Christ in you. And it's
[1:23:02] Christ that God's look at
[1:23:05] not you.
[1:23:07] Hallelujah.
[1:23:10] God looks at Christ the logos.
[1:23:14] Hallelujah. And that was the perfect
[1:23:16] picture, right? God took of you in the
[1:23:19] beginning.
[1:23:21] Hallelujah. It's not you in your present
[1:23:23] stage.
[1:23:25] Hallelujah. But Christ but God looks at
[1:23:29] Christ. Amen.
[1:23:33] God looks at you. You are marred.
[1:23:36] Amen. You're right. You're not in your
[1:23:38] right place. That's right. But he's not
[1:23:41] looking at this flesh.
[1:23:43] He's not looking at our present life.
[1:23:45] Right. Hallelujah. He looks to eternity.
[1:23:50] Hallelujah.
[1:23:54] Amen. So if there's
[1:23:57] no, it's Christ. So if there's no fault
[1:24:00] in him, how can there be fault? How can
[1:24:04] he find fault when you are dead in your
[1:24:06] life? Your you're dead and your life is
[1:24:09] hid in Christ through God sealed by the
[1:24:12] Holy Ghost.
[1:24:14] They that are born of God does not
[1:24:17] commit sin for he cannot sin. How can he
[1:24:21] sin when a perfect sacrifice is laying
[1:24:24] in his place?
[1:24:28] Blessed is the man to whom God will not
[1:24:30] impute sin. Amen. Hallelujah. God never
[1:24:34] looks at me.
[1:24:37] He looks at Christ because we are in
[1:24:41] Christ. Amen. and he can't lose me. Now,
[1:24:45] if I love Christ, I live with him. He
[1:24:49] had never brought me in less he knowed.
[1:24:53] If God saved me today knowing he was
[1:24:56] going to lose me six weeks from today,
[1:24:58] he's defeating his own purpose, right?
[1:25:01] He don't even know the future. Then if
[1:25:04] you save me knowing what's he want to
[1:25:07] save me for, knowing he's going to lose
[1:25:09] me. Yeah. God doesn't do things and then
[1:25:13] take it back and too weak to keep his
[1:25:17] promise. When he saved you, it's for
[1:25:21] time and eternity.
[1:25:24] I say amen to that. Amen. Amen. You in
[1:25:28] God and you the way you look or who you
[1:25:33] are or what your name
[1:25:36] is. That was God's thinking before the
[1:25:39] foundation of the world. And Jesus came
[1:25:42] not to save the whole thing, right? He
[1:25:46] wanted to, but he come to redeem and to
[1:25:50] bring back them that was in his thoughts
[1:25:53] before the beginning. That's the reason
[1:25:56] he was the word made flesh.
[1:25:59] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:26:02] to
[1:26:03] himself. The word, God's thinking of how
[1:26:07] he would do it. He expressed himself in
[1:26:10] Jesus Christ. It was God becoming
[1:26:15] material.
[1:26:17] And I believe God is becoming material
[1:26:19] in the bride.
[1:26:22] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. This is the bride
[1:26:25] coming of Christ.
[1:26:28] The fleshly body is subject to
[1:26:31] theophony.
[1:26:33] Hallelujah. We are carnal and that part
[1:26:37] must
[1:26:38] perish. But then inside we have a spirit
[1:26:41] man soul inside and that's faith in
[1:26:46] God's word. Then we bring our outside
[1:26:49] body under a subjection to that word by
[1:26:52] faith.
[1:26:53] How many can say amen to this statement?
[1:26:56] By accepting what God said.
[1:27:01] That's why we read in 1 Corinthians
[1:27:03] 9:27, "But I keep under my body and
[1:27:07] bring it into
[1:27:09] subjection, lest by any means when I
[1:27:12] have preached to others, I myself should
[1:27:15] be a cast away." Amen.
[1:27:19] We heard from our theophony. Right.
[1:27:22] Amen. And was what did it say? Come up
[1:27:26] hither. Yeah. That's right. You don't
[1:27:28] belong there. You're an eagle. You're
[1:27:31] not a chicken. Right. Hallelujah.
[1:27:35] Hallelujah. Bring your thoughts up here.
[1:27:39] Never mind what's happening on earth
[1:27:41] today. Right. Hallelujah. Amen. Don't
[1:27:45] worry about Obama. Yeah. Come on,
[1:27:46] brother. Right?
[1:27:49] Don't don't worry about uh uh uh the
[1:27:51] programs the government have today.
[1:27:54] Don't worry about the next pope. Right?
[1:27:58] Hallelujah.
[1:28:00] Focus your minds.
[1:28:02] Hallelujah. Set your minds on things
[1:28:05] that are above.
[1:28:08] Hallelujah.
[1:28:10] You have to think of our representation.
[1:28:13] Hallelujah. We are not earthly beings.
[1:28:17] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] We have been fashioned according to the
[1:28:22] image and likeness of God. Amen.
[1:28:25] Hallelujah. We are sons and daughters of
[1:28:27] God and we are represented in heaven.
[1:28:32] Thank God for the message.
[1:28:34] Hallelujah. Because it lifted us up to
[1:28:37] to to our rightful position in in Christ
[1:28:40] Jesus. Amen. Right. I asked the
[1:28:42] musicians to come.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah.
[1:28:47] Amen. Praise. I think I did pretty good.
[1:28:58] Thank God.
[1:29:00] Hallelujah.
[1:29:04] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Let's all stand.
[1:29:13] for in the red
[1:29:16] book of redemption. Amen. Praise the
[1:29:19] Lord.

[1:29:35] Amen.
[1:29:36] Amen. Let's sing it.
[1:29:40] Nations are breaking. Amen. Israel's
[1:29:45] awaking. The signs in the Bible fortold.
[1:29:50] Thank you, Jesus. Gentiles days numbered
[1:29:53] with her comfort
[1:30:00] eternal. The day of redemption is
[1:30:05] near. His hearts are failing for fear.
[1:30:10] Praise the Lord. God bless
[1:30:12] you. Amen. Praise the
[1:30:15] Lord. God bless you.
[1:30:18] Lord,
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] your victory is Amen. You believe it?
[1:30:27] The day of redemption.
[1:30:34] Realizing who she is.
[1:30:38] return. And what does it matter what the
[1:30:40] rest of the world? Like our brother
[1:30:41] said, who's who's worried about the next
[1:30:43] pope?
[1:30:45] Who's worried about the next things?
[1:30:51] He's taking care of us all the way.
[1:30:55] Your lamb's dream.
[1:30:58] Look up. Anybody have a need? We heard a
[1:31:02] great message. Now come and reap the
[1:31:03] benefits of it.
[1:31:09] any beyond the
[1:31:12] sky. God's church is a power that's
[1:31:16] changing this
[1:31:18] hour. Redemption
[1:31:22] is chaos. Redemption is near.
[1:31:27] Men's hearts are failing for
[1:31:31] fear. Be filled with the spirit. your
[1:31:34] lamp.
[1:31:37] Anybody have a
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:42] need prophets are lies? God brought
[1:31:45] truth there tonight. And Jesus the
[1:31:49] Christ is our God.
[1:31:53] They're denying the truth of the word of
[1:31:54] God. Who he is.
[1:31:58] Destroying the word of God. Hallelujah.
[1:32:02] A little bride. not worry.
[1:32:06] She's walking right down the line.
[1:32:11] She's heard from her theophony.
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:19] See, then we just walk right on down the
[1:32:21] road.
[1:32:22] We don't have to worry about a thing.
[1:32:24] That's right.
[1:32:27] Sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:32:30] Jesus.
[1:32:33] I'd rather be here than to be in heaven.
[1:32:36] Oh, yeah.
[1:32:37] You know,
[1:32:39] that's hard to say, isn't it? But think
[1:32:42] about it. This is where God's at. Amen.
[1:32:46] He's left there to come in here
[1:32:48] condescending, right? And he's here with
[1:32:50] his people. Amen. What a day. What do we
[1:32:52] got, brother? Let's sing. Jesus is
[1:32:54] coming soon. 288.
[1:32:57] Troublesome times are here. Filling
[1:33:00] men's hearts with
[1:33:05] fear. Now let's
[1:33:08] say humble your
[1:33:12] heart. Think about
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:20] it. Jesus is coming. We know he's
[1:33:23] already here.
[1:33:26] But there is a coming to be finished.
[1:33:30] When we meet him in the
[1:33:32] hour, all be over with all beyond.
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:51] It's coming. Let's see.
[1:33:53] Let's see if God is real. Take him in
[1:33:56] his word. signs come to pass. You just
[1:33:59] believe

[1:35:29] Prophet of God said, "God rather
[1:35:32] heal us than the fact of us wanting to
[1:35:34] be
[1:35:36] healed." He more desires to heal us than
[1:35:39] even our own thoughts.
[1:35:41] But we got to believe it
[1:35:45] and just believe it and say, "Thank
[1:35:46] you."
[1:35:51] Say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:55] Then he can come on and sing and make it
[1:35:56] manifest.
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:02] Amen. You believe it? Amen. Let's give
[1:36:05] our brother a good
[1:36:08] hand. We believe the word. We thank God
[1:36:11] for the word.
[1:36:14] Cuz what else is it beside the word?
[1:36:18] What would it be any good if you had all
[1:36:20] the riches of the world? It's going down
[1:36:23] fast.
[1:36:24] What good would it be?
[1:36:28] It'd just be a vapor. What if you had
[1:36:31] good health? It's just going to be going
[1:36:32] down, deteriorating it, you know,
[1:36:34] deteriorating, just going away. But to
[1:36:37] have his word,
[1:36:40] he said he sent his word and healed us
[1:36:43] during the Psalms and delivered us from
[1:36:45] destruction. Amen. Send his word. Amen.
[1:36:49] Thank God for the word. Amen. You
[1:36:52] believe that? Just tell our brother how
[1:36:53] much you appreciate him. We appreciate
[1:36:54] him coming, being with us. And I pray
[1:36:57] that the Lord would bless him as he
[1:36:58] travels along and and preaching the word
[1:37:01] of the Lord. And we just thank God for
[1:37:04] the word that he's given us that we can
[1:37:07] walk in it, right? Amen. Let's just be
[1:37:09] dismissed. Father, we thank you for this
[1:37:12] day. We thank you for our brother that
[1:37:13] has brought the word unto us tonight.

[1:37:19] Lord, we believe that your brother
[1:37:21] believes. So we just thank you for that.

[1:37:29] to bless each one. Bless our brother and
[1:37:31] his wife as they continue on their

[1:37:36] them. give her all the the love and
[1:37:38] guidance and mercy that could be given
[1:37:41] to them that they would Lord be in
