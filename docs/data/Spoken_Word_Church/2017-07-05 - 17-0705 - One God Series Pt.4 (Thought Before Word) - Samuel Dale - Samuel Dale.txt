me [Music] shining in Nevada for your power and love Ashley feel your loving [Music] holy holy and I want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to see him we just look into his word you'll find him not probably said when you begin to see the word you see in Jesus so what do we want them to see amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you got turning your scriptures we're still hung on John 1 we haven't got out of going backwards you know in eternity and trying to come down so then we keep reading that scripture to be able to follow the salt remember the fellowship meeting now will be the third Saturday at rather Longoria's anybody want to go with us make sure you let us know and remember brother Shetty will be with us on the 19th of July and brother Soriano will be with us on the 30th of July but the Queen will be with us on the 6th of August and brother Len Len will be with us on the 9th of August so these are scheduled and already ahead of time okay and then John one father we thank you we ask you to just most of all forgive our sins make us worthy guard to be your children your offspring you chose us so then we have to depend on that but that doesn't give us a right to just be anything we want to be so close to you until we can surely call you our Father and we will just walk in that light the Lord we love you bless each one member the ones that are not with us tonight still some traveling and different times so bless each one we love you and we thank you and we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen it says John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God now that doesn't mean with like two people right that's not what it's emphasizing it's emphasizing the fact of the self existing one more than it is to try to bring a Trinity and the word was god see that saw was a problem the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word know as I've tried to express here a few weeks ago a little thought you know we asked ourselves a question sometimes about the way God writes his word but now remember he does two things in writing his scriptures all right he reveals it to his children all right called us a very private letter not written to the world it is written only to the bride of Jesus Christ others can read it and follow in thoughts and lines but it is not written to them it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus right all right now to then it's written to reveal to the children but it's written to hide it from the wise and prudent like I said wouldn't it it wouldn't be much of a surprise it wouldn't take a revelation if you started off in Genesis and it would be fulfilling the scriptures you know and say in the beginning Jesus created all things well that's exactly what the scripture says question said that John says it Hebrew says it vision says it yeah it's so you could literally say that but there wouldn't be no mystery right and see if you read it here like this if you said in the beginning was Jesus and Jesus was with Jesus and Jesus was Jesus and then saying Jesus was manifested among us there wouldn't be a mystery you understand what I'm saying the Bible's written to hide it from the wise and prudent now we'll read it again in the medical I want to get to throw tanner what brother Brandon would talk about in the beginning before the eternal he said well that's just you know that just blows your mind well why would it blow our mind what if it is said in the beginning was God or Jesus or whatever it was right and just say back before he created anything you know that he truly existed what's he that that wouldn't be a problem but it's not stated in that way even brother Branham a lot of times will state things that I like the way he said it in this quote that's reason I keep giving it over and over so let's just read that one go ahead with number one I like that we come up with a way of breaking it down to understand the commas and things but I'm wanting you to see the point that he's trying to make he's simply trying to state that before anything existed we look back and we see eternity and the best way to see that is for the point of saying you know if there is a God surely he's eternal well then to bring it down you've got to see it by revelation you can't see it my theology if the theologians can take it and break it down and and do things but they can't keep it totally in line right but watch now look what he's saying notice now his attributes then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute all in one without being expressed then when you express second early he became then the word now listen to what we're saying tonight this is the thought of the whole message the title of the message is thought before word if you hold that in your mind so before word then you'll see why it will say in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God it's first all than word but now remember what it's saying are about attribute we'll get back to that but then and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us st. John rivers in the beginning but before the eternal that destroys our mind and once he said notice in the beginning was the word when time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word alright now think about it so we try to figure out what it means to be this for that alright a beginning means a starting point or are something to look at now how are you going to talk about an eternal God that the Prophet would say he covered all space time and eternity and then you try to comprehend him so you can't do it it's got to be left to work that is done by revelation right by revelation so you can't follow God by intellect you can only follow n by revelation because you can't comprehend an eternal God with a human mind we see we try to figure it out and try to get it to fit here fit here fit now it doesn't fit anywhere me it has to be believed as the Prophet would say you got to believe that there is a God it's not a power of words or persuasion or whatever to to try to give us understanding it's a very fact of being truth who stop trying to figure it out and just believe it just believe it because what we've done now this is for messages and we haven't come out of eternity yet one of the things that I'm approaching is on this side of that eternity because I want you to see how real it is and how real eternity is maybe one of these days that our donors that that new birth that we have is a very part of God it's his own life it's the person of Jesus Christ coming in living in you see that can't be figured out you mean as a person come down to lives in the end of the person the words that is in here they'll hear over see this no it's believing it so it was never a time I don't mean never now because the apostle - understood but after you coming down to the ages you lost the ability to explain God I don't mean that wrong explain God because you never could explain it but mankind by his own ideas lost all thoughts of understanding an eternal God then the Prophet had to come and spend all of those years preaching trying to reveal God and in doing that it's got to be revealed to you just a simple little statement see you say I can't understand in the beginning before the eternal you think I'll make it confusing I try to make it simple how about something being before the word because it was first attribute or thought and then word then trying to understand really what we're trying to understand is to look back by way of a profit bringing it to us to see what God has done that's what makes it so marvelous to me to see that how the eternal God by way of a simple seventh grade education man could bring God down from eternity we might find that one of these days that old black guy that was up there you know when he first brother branham first met him the colored guy you know that all the rest ever talking about what's going on on earth said he took his message from back before the foundation of the world come down the horizontal rainbow bringing him down it meant something to him well but he was a prophet he knows more he sure did enjoy hearing the colored brother explained that this and he emphasized that all through his ministry of thinking why in the world they're going to put that old man up there when they got all these young guys but when he got through another man got through bringing his message your prophet went home happy he heard from what he believed can you take it anyone what about a prophet don't you think he'd be listening he would brag about brother Neville and the messages he's brain brother lavell and all of those brothers but around him would brag about you know Thank You minute you know what I think he meant it even though he was a prophet but yet me see to me it's very simple God has tried to condescend to mankind and to do that it bypasses all thinking of our carnality remember what we gave where the Prophet said you can't go back in theology any further than in the beginning when he said by revelation we go you see the most theologians how do you think they felt sitting there listening to a man that would start talking about how the world come into being and this happening that happened and it's a boy he don't know nothing about the Bible that's what he said and he said might not know much about the Bible but as I know the author real well but now the problem was at the end of the service when he said if I told you the truth now let God come down it means say now come on brothers or you're welcome for the pulpit if you were to come and do this well you know they didn't get up and go up they have the sense not to do that because they knew that he had some contact that they didn't have but I hope you've understood now what I've tried to bring message after message at least three of them about how real God is and how real he was before you could have any thoughts of eternity Zorba for eternity or anywhere in eternity or whatever that God was real he didn't come into being he always was a being he didn't come in existence to be something he always was that I want you to get that part and think about it because we're going to deal with thoughts and attributes and I want you to think about what I've always tried to teach you 47 years this is not new I don't want to worry about it I can go right in my closet there's a big old box there and I'll pull it out let you read the title sister Johnny wanted to take all my messages one time and put them into you know book form I said good luck first off you can't read them second off you wouldn't know what in the world it was being saying because it's me talkin you know I'm not exactly like brother branham but it's pretty close sometimes he'd draw a star going across the bridge you know we'll see he preached for two hours over that stars going across that bridge but he wasn't said they just are going across the bridge that made him think and kept him lined up to what he wanted to bring alright but think about it now the point tonight is what if you thinking about in the beginning all right in the beginning was the word where's was with God the Word was God now by way of the Prophet we back up before that word comes into being you said what your words eternal well praise God you thought of that with everything the word talks about it's not eternal God created everything right but everything he creates is not eternal you got to remember that and remember to thought that I've always tried to make to you whatever attribute you can think of you know father son Holy Ghost Lily LaValley right you know anything on any point that you can bring a father healer Savior or whatever remember those attributes already existed in him as a part of him before he ever even made one angel or star or anything if not so you're making him as a president you can't add two you can't add to the Word of God you got to believe it like it is and let God reveal it see then all of those attributes if you see anything you can think of he never gained that as he come down he displayed it as he came down he's never getting anything he didn't become eternal by us writing the word eternal on the page or something remember what I've emphasized to do it because the best I can do that that you tell him to show the self existing whatever the word could you use to at least to how that much but now look that's education that's theology that's man's definition because when he met Moses get a name it couldn't be pronounced and it can never be pronounced by theology but it may be so simple that we've stumbled all across it I could try to express the brother one time that brother branham told him he would speak the word and one day he'd walk out he never didn't do that but before he died I explained to him one thing I said brother that in my home I said brother you've probably said what you're supposed to say millions of times but it's never dropped from your head to your heart as it may be so simple but it's never dropped from the head and into the heart it may be by shots I'm healed but you see is it was never meant to be talking about Sunday's are you on my company being in and all forgive me sometimes I have to back up and you know without finding backing up a lot of times it's helpful to the older ones as much it is the younger ones too to be able to understand but talking Sunday about God dwelling alone but yet we think about him as dwelling alone as notice he's nothing he's just nothing he's just ever worked well in alone I've tried to make it into terminologies to help us how many millions of years I know God can think in a million years in the flesh right come on so don't misunderstand me but what about him thinking before the world of what he's going to do he could spent millions of years walking through the portals of whatever region you want to call of heaven or where he was at her we've done determine that with rudder on said he had a house he said he lives in heaven how long would it take you to think over and write down your life if you wrote ever mind you detail how long would it take him but why don't you think about God doing and you set in our thinking way Mike it was telling well you don't know I know one dying he's God we limit into what we do but why don't you allow him to be able to think about what he's going to do is there any probable man well my problem with you is brother Dale you try to make him too too real I would to God I could make him so real that he would appear here real to you to see that is real I would do God I could make him so real that you would understand but you don't want you'll never understand how really is unless he reveals himself now that's the point for tonight you will never understand him by human intelligence you cannot comprehend an eternal God with our peanut brains of trying to figure things out we're not you sat down and listened to him talk sometime you know what I've brought over and over here lately you know prayer is a communication well you know we do all the laughing my don't we stop listening to him he might show us something you see we we think about eternity well how can you think about eternity the only way you can think about eternity is to think by revelation how could you explain to somebody that don't have eternal life about eternal life you know yourself well what I'm fixing this age right that even with eternal life in our soul as a child of a son and daughter of God we still have a lot of problems residual mentality that we have right brother Gary Atkins we used to talk of what in the terminologies or something like that and you know he'd say oh I just hadn't failed anything or had any real good feelings for months now I said you just that far I said I appreciate our Sunday three times a week back then especially I said I'm preaching and I haven't had a word from God until her from the time I started preaching yeah but you think she's just all made it God Rena I love this message the random was a prophet you agree the great contact with God you agree you mind if I tell you a little story about him that one day he said he couldn't get nothing from the Lord and he got in his car and wrote all up in the Clarks Turner and what it was up above Jeffersonville rolled all the way back up in there he's because he couldn't get anything getting contact with God and he was a prophet so how much you think we can't be left if he had trouble getting contact with God and he got one time every five minutes where do you think me and you gonna be pull it right maybe one time there were five years can I quote write about and said God may train you only your life for one 30-minute sermon give her down even a man preach all of his life three services a week then with preaches one sermon on a host of life he said see there's a lot of times if you think they're hard to understand something about this without of the other there's a lot of things that could be expressed it hit wonder about I remember one brother he was telling about you know how the Lord was leading him to go and he was talking about fishing and boy he was just you know the Lord told him he got to a place Lord told him to fish or in this little pond he said Lord ain't no fish in that pond I can see the bottom of the Elda I'm gonna fish over here Lord said fiction over here he's I'm gonna fish over here Lord says Mitchell here I didn't make the light of it it's between them the Lord the Lord ain't gonna argue with you buddy he gonna tell you where to go fish and if you don't go fish he ain't gonna beg you all day get you to go right you agree without he doesn't play with anybody do we get her ideas and thoughts and we think oh it's this way that way but think about it what about something that was happening before the word you know before you come into a situation of saying the word all right now we can go back behind that where it says in the beginning was the word weird with guarding the Word was God if we can go back by revelation back there then we can see that there is something like that a reality and remember time hasn't begun yet I know it took six days to make man in the world and all the things Brown said time never begun until sin entered the picture but we one day was this and one day without it one day we had trip over will we had seven days I brother hell I wouldn't want it major study it was your prophet that says he said time beginning when the fall came into being yeah but we don't see that's where we get into all of that and we get all into those things and we wind up naturally confused what about an eternal God never had a beginning never had an ended but yet I don't like this word but it's only word I don't have the education we get he would limit himself to doing things to help you and I now if you think I'm throwing off on God then you're in bad shape he limits himself you remember the other day when they're talking about it what about a God who has amnesia well he can't remember your sin right you can't remember your seat he has the ability to forgive and forget we have the ability sometimes to forgive but we can never forget and see God condescending he didn't send somebody else he came himself when he was existing alone self-existing so you know yourself for sure that I don't believe in all of this predestination doctrines it's around well I always was eternal I could just feel it yeah I believe what the Prophet says about which you better approach predestination the way the Prophet approaches it which is only one way to approach predestination not foreknowledge right I didn't say that your prophet said that so then there's no native thinking about all of this stuff was we back there was we did what we do we're going to get into a message next probably when we're the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy we just remember we're going to still be an eternity not on earth we got to start to hire yeah because I don't know what okay but look here's what I love because like I said we read there in the message the Prophet said in the beginning was the word when the time begin it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word so now we're automatically by paced gentleman John one bilk you following me by way of a prophets delivering a message and that's by revelation we're already back there we have it came we haven't brought any thoughts coming this way yet we're looking at him and how really is and him existing before we can have any thoughts or whatsoever humanly speaking about him we must believe it by faith you remember here while back and I was trying to express anybody in the Bible that ever amounted to anything come by what faith a revelation my brother Dale you just make it confusing how can it see can I say it this way why don't you get the new work on my guest couple of clicks went off some people turned off you know because they don't want to hear stuff like that what is it true it regardless of anything is it true that there's no way to comprehend an eternal God except my revelation you can't put him in a cubical box and try to explain him your probably didn't have him in a box he had him coming from the heart up through the mind to speak about an eternal God then we're going to have to get eternal with him to be able to understand is that so he said yeah but brother you sound like you're talking about that a lot of people need your Newburg brother asked me something years ago about something on a doctrine he said what do you think about it I said brother I think a lot of people don't have anywhere I said that's just fine language how can you how the Neuberger can turn down the word you see no but you're not talk about people like oh my family's out there my dear from idea mine are too but the truth is the truth you can't prop it up or do anything cuz there are families we've got to admit where we're at God could take care of our families we can't see what about it now first of anything you can think of is L ahem being self-existing okay but he dwelt along with his scholarship if you don't get nothing out of the message tonight please think on this time he could have millions and millions of trillions of years to sit under a tree here anywhere you want to put it and think about you and I think of ever nat there were better time like i've ever person that would ever accept jesus christ you know are you going to limit him like that I know I got in trouble trying to explain something one down and I generally do every time I try to explain if that's alright I try to explain it because that means I'm trying to help you it was one down the road one day and a taste of no Baptist preacher that old Baptist preacher preached more sermons I mean more funerals not house sermon again it was wonderful oh man one man that I never heard nothing in all my life about it everybody loved him and I think it was eight preachers preach this fearful I believe that try I didn't go but I read about it everybody thought the world the old man but when he passed me I said I mean I fight him I thought Lord that man he's preached more funerals in the house sermons he loved by everybody but why didn't you choose him and we're not going into the philosophy then being to over there's at it we just keep it like plain language okay I said why didn't you choose him and you chose me to bring the end of this message I don't know I don't know whether he turned the word down not told off on it well I said we could put him in other other range of peoples and think and maybe old enough to have eternal out I don't know that's none of my business that even what I'm talking about I'm talking about a simple point why did he choose you why did he choose you even to be where you are now you don't never think like that the Lord why see I know I go crazy and my thinking is hard because it went on down the road I was thinking about I thought the same thoughts going along that and I thought about a girl that I had an opportunity today but I didn't Jorah but I thought about that girl and I thought Lord what if I to married that girl you know what if I the dated heard and married that normal and she was a Methodist I said Lord I'd probably be a Methodist preacher you see you're stupid I know I agree with you but you know sometimes I have a good time I mean I enjoy it sometimes just thinking and maybe you ever try he's 17 but God knows that better my god I've always tried to explaining this away my God knows who I would marry and what would happen but he also knew what would have happened if I'd married that girl he said now you're going too far why you're limiting your God why do you limit him if he knows every thought you'd ever have George he never would have whatever would think about it why would we worry about in the rest of it when I just be happy we're happy and rejoice and said God chose us and then we go back before the foundation in the world find out he chose us tired we'll get into that later but to think about an eternal God with eternal goals but just remember our point to try to help you if you don't understand how that they could be something back theis the beginning that gives you to see is in the beginning was the word but before it was word it was thought then you'll realize one of these days if you wouldn't up in heaven playing around with in God's mind prophets said you were he said not your being here then you realize there's a great thing to all of this see then God doesn't have a stamp I'll take this one won't take down whatever you think about eternal life just remember you've got to accept it before you can have it so when I come in the world eternal I've you did I got the profit I know where the quotes are I said laying on my desk you want Robert I didn't believe I was always eternal within what did Jesus time solve the whole problem soon but it won't stop the thinking you know when we walk off of this earth when these days church and the great glorious rapture will understand what all this was about and the purpose and plans for all of this the Bible says I'm looking at it today when the Prophet was expressing how that your very being in things will start he's explained it and he dropped down into a scripture he said even the harder of your head and then he watched he stopped see her ever something he moves into the thought and he says you can't add one cubit who your being watch ha why not for one time relax and let God come into our hearts and lives and got us into the truth and let him show how much he loves us but then you remember this one of these days we'll get around to it if he's building a future home to fit our desires you believe that that's what your prophet says well then you mean to tell me he's old like your desires you dishonours is what brings him to you what about it but I love this statement do I like it starting off on what we're going to be talking about when we talk we talk a little bit Sunday there about how God dwelt alone now we're talking about how God dwelt alone with his thoughts see we're backing up a step from the word because it's taught first and then word so just think about it listen to what he says here in the message who do you say this is 1964 number two brothers that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt alone with his thoughts now look at that next word I love it he'll never do that again cause his thoughts are being medic benefit and that's why we are right here this day if God fellowshipping with his dollars in made manifest ours were you look there you are so by taking thought now he's talking about the thoughts of God in him by taking talk cannot add one cubit to your stature you cannot do this that or the other it's God that short mercy is God all the father's giving me walk under me and no man can come except my father draws him that settles it think about him think about what he's saying you'll never dwell alone he was drilling back there with his dogs all along I think he was happy I do I think he was having a joyous time we look at him as just nonchalant they're sitting around wondering what's going on what does I just a spirited just loafing around we don't say there's nothing see we're limiting our God and to bring him into our thought pattern instead of realizing how great he is these are these children to get these children to just think about God being real is my greatest goal in life so why don't you explain this rather I can't explain nothing else but the way I am get the kids to see God as real it's my goal since the gale asked her when she thought we started Sunday school and she said Sam what do you want me to teach I said I want you to teach them little children that there are little David and that they can take their little slingshot of faith and face that main devil and conquering so little I think and small amount that I think of go that's wonderful to me they try to get you to see Jesus Christ all right but do you follow me he said God dwelt along with his thoughts that's back before word now Co we're going to come on down and prove in a minute through the Prophet that it's thoughts first and word but he dwelt alone but he'll never do that again that's wonderful to me now cuz you know what we're part of that look at the next one get number three this God changed his mind but you see God the Great Spirit the father in him was attributes now watch thoughts and attributes now and remember its attributes and thoughts before it becomes word that's the whole point in him was attributes what's the attributes to be a savior to be a healer and be father to be son attribute right so they was there with him any a part of him before he ever even started thinking about us has to be in two beings and what would be and these things that you see displayed now just his attributes being display he dwelt alone he was not even God God was an object of worship he was the great eternal one and in him was attributes such as to be father to be Savior to be healer and now how could he first he had to be father because it proves he was father but he dwells alone he alone is immortal and now but his attributes has to be displayed his first attributes you remember what I said there was at last this past Sunday or when with Linda see everybody's always said if I just feel like I'm in the mind of God I just feel like I'm in the mind Judas Iscariot was in the mind of God what do you want to carrot was in the mind of God Adolf Hitler was in the mind of God I don't want to just be in the mind of God I want to be a part of the mind of God and I thought that's what the Bible said I thought Paul summed it up person what let this mind that was in Christ Jesus being you it'll make you a new creature would it be a part of the mind not just what he thinks up in him was attributes he alone is immortal what about a garden an immortal God now if you want to go with that when you run all you want to call him mortal means flesh mate eternal that's the best definition I can give you for immortal go to the next one wisdom verses faith in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the Word was in God it was God it was his thoughts that was with him always done God's thoughts is as eternal as God is are you read Amen that ain't skin me up bro yes he loved that one did here it comes God's thoughts with his word in the beginning that's in eternity now when beginning first started time in the beginning was the word God's talk and the Word was with God and the Word was God and his thoughts is what he was when right back to everything relating right down to him and his thoughts and his attributes we'll read one in a minute where Braille runs called it attributes he said that's his desires attributes a part of God if you're not a part of God you never will be we'll get onto those statements as we go along but look what he said what does it take to make a Christian life number five which is e 40 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now word is a thought expressed God had in his mind what to do but when he expressed it there's word it had to come into existence it become it's become a reality because it was God's Word expressed I draw the how God's promise in all of your realities in mine just a promise you realize we're promised a change of the body we're promised an eternity after this we're promised a lot of things somebody's going to walk into that why don't we believe we're part of it the other things that just get one man quote the Bible be careful saying those things because the Bible says that they'll say we've heard this from the beginning so you can be fulfilling Scripture it's the next one number six we just melt shattered it that's a good message really to read our listeners and say now in the beginning God dwelt along with his attributes he dwelt along with his attributes now he's making his attributes something right and he's dwelling with his attributes he never became a savior he wasn't saved he never became a healer he was a few what I wouldn't have doctor said I was I got to do with it that's when you come on over here according to the Bible he was the lamb slain before the foundation where we tend to profit turn around say what he said but it's 4,000 years ago when it come into manifestation I'm not there's manifestations there's realities of things right but in God it was done before the world listen that's his thoughts there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks it's he's going to to build create he cannot create he can take something talking about the architect that's been created and make it in a different form because God is the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do that's his thoughts that's his desire he desired to be a savior he desired to be a father he desired to be a healer that was his desire before the world ever begun we're not even talking about physical creations I'm deliberately pulling the quotes to making it Staton but back before not some of these down under here they have quotes about you and me I'm deliberately trying to show you how the Prophet could start in the 40s and through the 60s and hold the same talk that's the way I see a prophet but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires that's a thought and then he speaks it and its word then a word is a thought when it's expressed is a word I thought Express is a word but it has to be a thought sir so it's God's attributes remember thoughts and attributes are the same word it's God's attributes and it becomes a thought in a word he said knowledge attribution is okay you go anywhere you want to just remember that what I'm dealing with his attributes and thoughts and times are the same and then it speaks and which is the word you know what brother Brennan said he said it stuck the logos is like a little feller a little child playing outside the father's don't worry you know just saying let there be he's going to put his thoughts into reality go ahead number seven sure is we would see Jesus in the beginning God was not even God he was the great eternal and there was attributes attributes with his thoughts and then he'd become a word like this and a word expressed well a thought expressed is a word a word expressed is it's all I think no bother he does it because that's what he's saying well I thought Express is a word and a word expressed are spoken he's from the dollop are you 400 go ahead to the next one Christ identified the same he was self-existing of him so there was nothing to worship him so he was just a great eternal now in him was attributes and attributes this folks just like you have to think of anything before you speak it then when you speak it it becomes a word and then he is the eternal and in him was the attributes and he spoken it was the word and the word has made manifest as the word has made manifest this God becoming material look at his word real as he called it in speaks it as him coming down to reality to material material means something founder okay what's the next one this is a good movie that the other church a book a long time Adam the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the salt regarding tunnel you can if you can see this will you see many times God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his in his abilities therefore he as God must be under Xiang if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taken counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best could say best we could say that some time he will be but that's not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new talk about anything because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have it and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are eternal they are real now look at he he used up here minute ago a man with a blueprint type of thing kind of laying it out now like what he says what God does they are not simply like a man with the blueprint is drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and from and formed but they are already real and eternal and a part of God so now we're back into his thoughts we've done come taste the word you understand we're going to have to get this stock and then let him speak but you only speak is the Hogs let's look at a few of these aren't the Second Coming which is number 10 each 24 go ahead and rolled it up with you talk about the word being made manifest in the beginning was the word word with God Word was God not a people that the word was to take a word is the expression of thought it has to be a thought before it can be a word won't that driven in there I've got a lot of quotes till God in the beginning gave the thought of what would be spoke the word what far not ordinated we see we receive the word and it produces what God God thought was the word is the gospel and C form C we want to speak the word that's always been man's kind ever since I've been in the message everybody's always said we want to come to adoption we won't come to speak to word I made a statement and everybody thought I was contrary to them but I was making straight statement I said you can't speak the word till you get it you can't speak the Word of God until God gives you his word you're saying what somebody else says you're saying what somebody else says and brother branham I was looking at you see if we're doing that if we're saying what somebody else said then what do we do we're just talking about somebody else's it's not something to you eisah reason I say it the way I say it was crazy but Moses at the burning bush he said I believe you're the God of Abraham Isaac Jacob but I ain't going unless you give me something personal how much more personal could it be made than what God said to Moses and I've got it in the last year no we won't get to it but I made this statement for 40 years it's an all phrase point I mean a little bit I don't mean wrong I mean that I've quoted it saying one thing for the tea when it is you know but brother branham is explaining Moses receiving the thought he said it's God's thought transmitted into the mind of Moses he said it's Moses Tom said it's not word yet he said Moses then speaks it what's wrong you're six a biased shots on me look at your children and say they are saved look at them and say they're lost you're saying what the devil says I don't need that he needs somebody to stand on what he's saying well you can bank on one thing if I ever say it it'll be God telling me to say it well why don't you try you know once you just tried why don't you just start out by saying by shots on the yield you might walk into it you heard Wade testifying there Sunday let that man over in South Carolina that they told him he had three months to live this guy was or something up in a college or doing something he wouldn't listen to like Jack like guy like us he was a good guy and he just helped me he just he'd go with me and put me take me in the woods and help me and walk with me and day after day and didn't feel nothing sound it is that if we just had a good time but when he told that it wrong down inside of me I went out in the truck and got my Bible got a prior clock you've heard it told walked up to him and I said Terry you know what that is he said yes I am I do bad this preacher extended I turned with us I'm going off on he was just looking I said Terry did they say you got three months he said yeah that was in March I said we'll see you in November he said okay we'll see you know better November rolled around he was there telling the whole place doctors lawyers all kinds of people that were sitting in there said the Lord healed me I'm healed he went nine years about a year before he died or so he went on an Alaskan down sheep trip where you just walk four miles up into the mountains or things like that he was a great friend but you see it was just he said well what told you to say that I don't know I just said it once it matter that dad just preached you might've pray for a no problem he might have prayed for him to be healed I got no problem I'm not trying to gain sin yard these are gained popularity SHhhh just know one thing for sure the man was healed right then because he lived for nine years instead of three months why can't we just go on and believe it but see we got but I was the first one that said that I said it first now know if that's I'm just honest if that's me are you or anybody that says I said at first you didn't say it you didn't say what God said it might have been that little child if you ever noticed what I've done here minute I took a prayer cloth and I stood around and said every man woman and child take this prayer clock and pray over it we send it in God heal it could be the least little child that contacted God what you see we've got to get it all blowed up I was the first one when you say that then it's for sure you what the first one is that plain enough because that puts me right in the middle of the whole time okay all right let's go on a little bit funny what's the next identification 1964 and in the beginning said Saint John for one was the word and the word with God now word has to be a thought before it's a word because the word is a thought expressed your ear whatever you do you're speaking it's a word you'll find out when we get to it that word lo gosh it has called multiple meanings if it means speech that's what it means it means speech and you had never caught on to really what brother branham will do a lot of times in listening to it and knowing like Jesus in the scripture Jesus breathed oh did he I'm honest I'm sorry do you go no he just spoke said receive you the Holy Ghost I didn't get it right then no problem we'll see we look at it like it's got to be up but remember it is word I've asked you to do one time I mean remember this one I've asked you to do one time you never notice about your breath and what it does sometimes turn the back of your hand and lay it like that and start praying you'll feel that our breathing those words that's what God does he's the breath of life you can feel it just just put your hand up down pray just put your hand up right now and just start saying hallelujah you can see a man you can move the hires when you hang him word has to be a thoughtful force work cause the word is without expression in the beginning was the word words with God the word was gone he was God and the word the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us okay let's get a couple more because these are the points or what I want to make from the message of trumpet give an uncertain sound but that word still stands eternally because it is a word and before it was a word it has to be a thought and a word is a thought expressed and God in eternity it come into his mind he expressed his thoughts it become a word and the word has to be made manifest well brother Dale I thought when you here's crazy when you began to tell us about God being a being and trying to emphasize on that too much well surely you probably think I really am crazy now but God thought it over before he spoke God it come into his mind what he wanted to do go to Christ mr. God reveal at least before Sunday and read we read around talking about the plan and purpose of God we're going to get there eventually whom conjuror let me just read these off will close in order to know if you want took your hand holler I'll give it to you now before it can be a word it has to be a fault for a word is a thought expressed and if God in his mind preceived these things then they were in his mind then he spoke them and they're just they're as good as finished when God speaks because he's infallible before it could be a word spoken it has to be a thought because a word is a thought made manifest when God speaks now back in the back back in the beginning when God looked down through the corridors of heaven and saw all the things that we're going to that we're going to happen on the earth we're going to happen did you ever sit and just draw a picture out in your mind now that's the way God did it go ahead that's number 14 can you get it back up 14 but it's the infallibility before it could be a word spoken has to be a thought before it was a thought made manifest and God speaks now back in the beginning when God looked down to the quarters for heaven and so all the things that we're going to happen on the earth did you ever sit down and just draw a picture out in your mind now that's the way God did it you ever notice brother Brennan the pilot says I'm kidding a thought is coming into my mind says now let me express it and this is why I love it he said for these little children and he said I'm one of these little children to where we can get it I love those don't you did you ever sat down and draw a picture out of your mind brother Gary and remodeling a house I'm already done with it all but anyhow he's got in his mind what he wants to do he sought it out yeah alright and he sets down and he thinking well as far as his thinking he said I'll do this on the debt off with this Europe at that and then he goes and makes it into reality right go into masterpiece and listen to brother around and talk about Michelangelo in his cup Ramos's he had in his mind what he thought to others there was a block of stone but to Michelangelo it was Moses sitting there waiting to come out into reality and glory God did it per house in the beginning and then it seemed good to him so he spoke it and as soon as it was spoken it became a word but all was expressed in a word now listen once God expresses his thought and makes it a word he could never take it back he can't take it back no way can he take it back a thought had to be a thought before it can be a word now this is God's thought that he has placed in the word when you read now that's a force field the word itself has spirit its spirit and word form and you see what when it is quickened by quickened are brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and actually because that now look a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word and then when a thought is presented it is a word see when it is presented now this god stop now this is how much the Word of God God's thought that he has placed in the word and then when we receive it from him it becomes a bird you realize what he's saying I would to God I had revealed in my heart what is written in my head wouldn't you you know what I mean you've read it you studied it over and over wouldn't it be something to have all of that into your mind and come out of it with a beautiful talk the God before the world is listening that prophet he had in his mind what he was going to do and he comes out and he steps out as a word and then he fenced in the word is the logos which is a son and he steps out and he says let her be what about a man could take us all the way back to that alright God's thoughts that he has placed in the word and then when we speak it from him it becomes a word God revealed to Moses what to do Moses spoke it and it happened see that's it when it really comes from God okay I want to read this one so go ahead and sir number 729 will be one continual reading there's many paragraphs but I would ask you to go home and listen to this message I read it 1954 1003 the morning service the word became flesh in the India trip but now here it tells us that before there was a man before in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God Lord Rickard and the word Word made flesh that's just about as far as the human mind can go on one one as far as a human mind can go that's as far as you can go back now to the beginning is that right in the beginning was the word but now that's as far as we can go by theology that's as far as we can go by our mind but revelation carries us beyond that is that right if you're teaching something on theology you think in the beginning was the word word with that was God and the word was Garcia theologian can read though sign this word the same word was made flesh and dwelt among us and then God was made flesh that's without controversy that's true God was made flesh we believe that but now before this was word what is a word a word is the manifestation of a thought is the expression of a thought is that right before you can say anything subconsciously you think it before you speak it and that's right a word first it was thought then it was word I love that about Moses because we can relate to it what about a man riding basically the Old Testament no you got all the other writings but you know I'm talking about the main point of the word Moses get all of that about Genesis or did get all of them time from the thought Paul pick it up in the New Testament and look at him where did you get all of that from the thought brother branham look at all the things that he went through and explained to us where to get it started on the thought a meditation a talk and then he would just bring it out so much until God would come into plain view I've set another day just thinking now weep about it to think we as Baptists we wanted to know about God all these people they want to know about God these churches they're not all that bad some kind of they want to know about God but they turn down the channel my way that God could speak to them that don't stop the little Bride of Christ come on musician they don't halt the little Bride of Christ she goes right on down the road believing God's Word listening to a man explained about God the one thing that we should all want is to know more about him he said but we don't need to know him by Inlet you cannot know him by revelation until you first hear it by Inlet I wish you'd get that out of your mind it's got to because the Bible says faith what cometh by hearing fake don't come by anything else it comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God letter Branum the great prophet as he was what would he say he said he talked to that angel an angel to say something to it he said the Holy Spirit which would tell him something he said go spend the rest of the day searching and I you know that you don't never think like this enough it's a great Holy Spirit that birthed a man that done all the things and yet it would tell him something you need to go home and study it I'm still holding skirts are you doing studying I told you well we know for certain that wouldn't hold expiry right we know for certain that wouldn't the Holy Spirit Holy Spirit was so happy what do you think he reported back to the Father you remember adoption and how he takes back he says your son is down our checking out he said I went and told him I told him what it was and said he's spending the rest of the day checking it out the father says give him a little more give him a little bit more Oh wonderful go ahead brother all got less tan first it's about all those attributes then it can be made manifest and now I see a brand new song all day [Music] we believe you whatever it is you can Karen because we thank you in Jesus anybody else he stupidly [Music] he did all my single ray I know his sings a brand new song amazing grace Oh as I can deliver each race in different ball if you run this these cooling and warming that form I am Peter Lee won't it me to see on that day I will sing a brand new song [Music] oh Jesus the only red random our thoughts are louder in heaven that our words on earth and certainly we try to keep them cleaned up what about having the right thoughts what about sitting down and just thinking about the Word of God thinking about God and what he's done for think about what's been to your life were you been and where you come from what you've done I brought you out of all these things what a wonderful time to think about God called about us he knows exactly what you're not going to do but he ain't gonna force us into doing anything he doesn't do that he leaves us a free moral agent he allows us to live me he doesn't make us do anything oh no how long he makes us he just made us like I seen him at that feller said well he's over here fish over there I just walked away because I didn't want to hinder his testimony and I didn't want to thank wrong but I just didn't think if you argue with God I just don't come I never never did Father we ask you to just speak to each one of our hearts and knowledge we've tried to express what your thoughts are how great they are how wonderful a day to think about that we could just be something that we would just start up even if we're lost and die and go to hell but to think about it Lord that we could be thought of in heaven and our names would appear there and you would consider us and what's more is it Lord if we just yield ourselves to you and get out of the way and let you think your thoughts to us and everything will come out better be with us on the way home take care of everybody we've had a lot of old bad weather sometimes Lord we don't argue about the weather we just ask you to be with each and every one of us and take care of everybody get a safe journey let your loving grace be with all of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Oh [Music] you
