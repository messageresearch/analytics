[5:22] Lord bless him be each one we pray bless
[5:26] the service now we pray and ask these
[5:27] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:29] amen
[5:31] let me read a couple of verses here in
[5:32] Revelations
[5:35] 3 Brother Joseph asked me minute ago
[5:38] what be the title of my message and I I
[5:41] told him to title it the truth of the
[5:46] thing that's why I believe we
[5:49] have have the truth that's what brother
[5:52] Bron called because so we'll call it
[5:54] message a thing but God is but Bible
[5:57] does and brother BR does right exactly
[5:59] so you know what you're saying when you
[6:01] say that right Revelations
[6:04] 3:20 behold I stand at the door and
[6:06] knock If any man will hear my voice and
[6:08] open the door I will come into him s
[6:10] with him and he with me and him that
[6:12] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[6:15] and my Throne he as I also overcame and
[6:18] have sat down with my father and his
[6:20] throne he that have near let him hear
[6:22] what the spirit say into the churches
[6:25] may the Lord bless his word you be
[6:28] seated
[6:30] now it's always you know you've heard it
[6:33] many many times but it's always to the
[6:36] Overcomer right you he that overcome it
[6:39] exactly no one's going to sit with him
[6:42] he didn't say sit on his Stone he say
[6:43] set in his Stone right right so no one's
[6:45] going to sit there unless you're an
[6:48] overcome amen amen exactly so now that's
[6:51] a and right here here's the the time now
[6:56] the overcoming it this is what we
[6:57] overcome right mean way we get on the
[6:59] other side if we make it the other side
[7:01] we we overcome right so then so we want
[7:05] to be be sure that we we hear the word
[7:10] brother BR he mentioned it before and
[7:12] you know and sure brother Dale has and
[7:15] the scripture even mentioned that that
[7:18] people tremble at the word right with
[7:21] reverence you know not just you're
[7:23] afraid of God or not you tremble at God
[7:26] says something you know you know that's
[7:29] he can't change it he can't take it back
[7:32] so it's going to happen the way am and
[7:35] you see yourself so far away from that
[7:37] you know right so you said only only God
[7:40] can do it only God can take you there
[7:43] you know and we sing that song There's a
[7:46] land beyond the
[7:48] river that we call us free forever you
[7:51] know there is a land beyond the river I
[7:54] don't want to die to go there I believe
[7:56] a land here there's a land beyond the
[7:58] river here GL spiritually speaking we go
[8:02] to we go to right here right that's
[8:05] right exactly right so remember that
[8:07] scripture I read on Revelations 3 that
[8:10] him that overcometh will sit with me in
[8:12] my Throne
[8:14] amen now I believe that takes place
[8:16] right here amen we know we s judg and we
[8:19] even judge Angels Saints with things
[8:21] that nature but I believe we overcome
[8:24] and we sit with him in his throne right
[8:26] here right because his throne is not the
[8:30] Father Strong right right all right now
[8:34] I got a lot of things wrote down in
[8:35] books here and
[8:37] uh and you know me I promise to speak an
[8:41] hour and you know and it's hard to quit
[8:44] an hour but but I I'll make it I promise
[8:47] I won't go much over now if I go that
[8:49] long so you just pray that the Lord will
[8:51] help us amen
[8:53] because when you got something to say
[8:56] you believe the Lord has give you
[8:57] something right and you want to you want
[8:59] to said you want the people to give
[9:00] that's right we come tonight you know to
[9:04] hear from him not hear me amen right see
[9:07] if John sent me down here he came in
[9:10] me going to be me say it brother Terence
[9:13] will be one who praying minut to go
[9:14] someone it's not going to be me saying
[9:16] it it's going to be him saying it
[9:18] through me am now if it's of gone if
[9:20] it's ordained of gone and if you have a
[9:22] need tonight and you're sick and you
[9:23] need healing nice to get
[9:26] healed he Jehovah brother Dale been
[9:28] preaching on
[9:29] was seven compound redtive names that's
[9:32] marvelous is
[9:34] it think that that one of them he took
[9:36] the 23rd
[9:38] psalms well I thought I have a spell on
[9:40] that
[9:44] one that's that's something
[9:46] else that's right so so he's all it all
[9:52] consummates all those names titles and
[9:55] his wonderful counsel Mighty God
[9:56] everling father Prince of all
[9:59] consummates in the person that's in you
[10:02] if you're if you're born again amen
[10:04] that's right it's all right in him right
[10:06] and Jesus all applies to Jesus Christ
[10:08] right so you can't have one that have
[10:10] them
[10:11] all like brother said they're incept you
[10:14] can't separate you can't have the father
[10:16] without having the son right you can't
[10:18] have the son without having the Holy
[10:19] Ghost that's right only one person many
[10:22] titles always know there's one PR one
[10:25] God he's one in person that's right
[10:29] always remember that that's right and
[10:31] that one God lives in here right that's
[10:34] right he's right here right it's where
[10:37] he well he it's he at Psalms 100 it's he
[10:40] that has made us that's right right
[10:43] you're son and daughter of God T not God
[10:45] made you that he made you that before
[10:47] the world
