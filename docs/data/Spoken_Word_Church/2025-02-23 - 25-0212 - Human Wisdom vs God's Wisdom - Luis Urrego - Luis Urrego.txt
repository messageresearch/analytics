========================================

of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe amen praise the Lord Jesus you have your seats amen we'll just continue reading here me I want to I wanted to read down down all the way to verse 29 I know it's a lengthy scripture but verse 22 for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than man I've always liked that scripture that that if God had foolishness if he was foolish that foolishness would be wiser than the wisdom of the world Amen but we know God is Not foolish we know that every time when God thinks something amen that is established that is you could just put a period on that that is thus sayith the Lord and that's got to come to pass amen praise God because the foolishness of God is wiser than man and the weakness of God is stronger than man amen for ye see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and things which are not to bring to not things that are and this is the reason why that no flesh should glory in his presence amen may the Lord out of blessing to the reading of his word amen praise God I I just want to talk this this evening just a little bit and maybe we might get a little a little technological this this evening but uh you you just bear with me I'm trying to make a point hopefully it'll get somewhere amen but you know I uh we we we work with technology we deal with technology and every every day uh you know it's it's the life of that that we are we are consumed by now days and and so and you know and I got to thinking I got to thinking that that the uh the other night that you know one of the greatest technological things in our day is is is AI artificial intelligence and if you haven't heard about it then um maybe you can get you know get up to speed with it it's definitely not Windows 95 or Doss I could tell you that and it's it's uh those were foundations but uh it's uh it's something uh very Advanced and maybe you older ones may not will not probably understand what we're talking about but uh we are heading into an age where artificial intelligence is is going to be the the dominant thing in our Computing world and in many areas of our life uh you some of you even have artificial intelligence wearing them on your bodies right now if you have smart watches and things like that so um uh is is very prevalent and we see it in our day and and you know I got to thinking that um you know we we think about artificial intelligence and you think about those words artificial intelligence artificial well usually when we think about artificial it's something uh something me you know something uh you know it's it's a love and hate type of thing you know it's something you can have an artificial tooth but it's not nothing like your real tooth you can have an artificial uh you know uh whatever artificial hair but it's not nothing like the hair that you were born with right you know uh that's maybe some of you sisters are or some of you brothers too you know it's not nothing I wish I had my hair back you know and and all that and and and but it's not nothing like the real thing the real deal is always the best right an artificial is always something that gets in between the real and and and you you see it makes you think that it is the real thing that's right right and you live with it and you and you enjoy it but again it comes from the knowledge of the of of the the tree of knowledge of what of Good and Evil right amen you see so it it can't be used for good but it also can be used for evil right but the original Creator amen the one who created heavens and earth the one where natural comes from the one where everything original comes from amen it's always good am it's always good amen praise the Lord Jesus and I'm so glad this evening amen that we serve a good god amen amen I don't know about you but I serve a good God Amen I serve a God Amen who who who is interested in in in in in in my life amen who is interested in what's going on personally and knows everything that personally going on in your life and is interested in it amen we we we can't we sometimes the devil tries to deceive us and let and think makes us think that God is not interested in our life and personally but yet God was the one who created and put you here amen how would he not be interested in what you're going through at this very moment amen because it was God Amen who brought you here praise the Lord Jesus amen and you know we and I was thinking you know we have we've we've elevated this this this uh this artificial intelligence in the last couple of years uh uh as something almost Godlike now and and if we're not careful it will eventually head that way amen and I remember brother brandham he was saying something on the lines of that when they start when they start working in the laboratory of God then he's going to have to step in when they start getting in there and they start uh uh getting in God's laboratory amen that's when he steps in Praise the Lord amen because he knows that it's ultimately going to lead to destruction it will always who is the originator who is the the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil we know it's nothing but Satan right amen but yet who is the tree of life is Jesus Christ so Satan always he's the author of Destruction he's the author of lies he's the author of of all these things so but yet it starts very very very good and gets you really into it and when you don't know it you have fallen in for it and you're in it and that's the reason why leoa is considered lukewarm because we're like boiling frogs we're like the boiling frog see is like the boiling frog that has been placed in the pot and is boiling slowly slowly slowly until eventually it will be it will be death and that's the reason why but God gave a solution for this day for this age Amen to get get of his eyes have amen praise the Lord he's got eyes have so that you can open your eyes amen and see amen what's going on in the hour that we're living in and we see it through the lens of his word praise the lord we don't have to be blind amen we can see and we can know by the message of the hour Amen in the day the day that we're living in Praise the Lord Jesus so brother Brandon would put it like this he said this he said in the marriage of the lamb in 1962 he said that that's the way the churches are too many today we're just taking the name of the Christian Church pretending to be the bride when it's artificially we're not connected with Christ in any way right amen and I just wonder tonight and I I sincerely ask you this morning this evening amen because the title of of of of my message this evening is human wisdom versus God's wisdom and which one dominates you which one dominates you amen I was going to call I was going to call it AI versus God's C creative intelligence but that I just left it alone when a more spiritual route with it amen but I want I want you to sincerely ask you ask yourself that question amen are you truly connected with Christ amen no I'm not saying I'm not saying are you connected with the church I'm not saying are you connected with just what your experience or I'm not saying are you connected because you knew the message you've known the message for 30 years that's not what I'm talking about are you truly connected amen with the person of Christ this evening amen praise God the life of the life amen the the the creator of all things amen the one amen who can change amen your heart who can change amen when something is going one way in your life amen and when you turn to him amen he can change and turn those things around for you praise God Amen unfortunately we like to just go and go to the artificial thing instead because it feels good and it's the less is the it's the easier route right amen praise the Lord now brother Rand continues to say we're like an artificial we're not connected with Christ in any way we're like an artificial tooth an artificial arm artificial ey see it's something that's artificial if we're just putting it on he says well you can't put on Christianity you've got to be connected with it amen and and there there is a true life that comes out of a true experience with God I believe that with all my heart amen and and the Temptation uh is to be to get lukewarm and to get and to get uh uh uh well I know a lot now and and and I've I'm established now so then I could just put the this on cruise control and and and you see but you don't understand and you don't realize amen that that is leading you to death amen amen praise God you'll be surprised that that day amen the ones who will enter in and the ones who don't enter in we will be surprised I just want to be one of the ones who enter in amen praise God and so this therefore that's why I want to be connected amen to the to that tree of life amen praise the Lord because that's the thing and that's the key that gives us life amen it's this word hallelujah I believe that with all my heart amen so when we when we go back to Genesis chapter 1 and and verse one we we see there that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth amen and and and when we look at the word created there or the word Creator the word Creator means originator architect or designer amen an originator he had an original thought spoke it and came to be praise God you were an original thought oh my what a wonderful thing it is to think amen that I was in God's mind amen and he was thinking of me and here I am here on in Earth in order to express him in this hour Amen in this age that you're living in praise God you were placed here to express him not to express yourself amen praise God and so that word means originator architect designer amen and God made man in in his own image amen uh to be little Gods here on this Earth amen you see we were if he was a Creator then the ones that he created were supposed to be creators as well amen and in one and Jesus Christ told the Pharisees one day then I call you Gods you see in other words we were supposed to cre be creators amen you're the on who creates atmospheres in your lives amen praise God brother Bram said if you you could create worlds and live in them amen if you just realize the power that that that that that that lies within you Amen in this hour amen but sometimes we we we find out that that we bring amen uh atmospheres that are negative to the atmosphere that Christ would bring in in in amen ask yourself sometimes amen when I come and step into the room what are people thinking what what what kind of atmosphere am I bringing are people pleased to see me there happy to see me there or is it the opposite because you are a Creator and you do create the atmospheres around you that atmospheres that will attract man or that will deter man right amen oh but there it's everybody else's fault amen no it can't be everybody else's fault no no it's got to be something amen what kind of atmosphere are you creating you see and we are we are we are creators in Genesis 1:26 uh God said this and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth you see so they were to have dominion amen God wanted wanted man to use the uh his creative powers to replenish the Earth Amen to be fruitful and multiply you see a a at the beginning and brother Bram spoke about this at the beginning man Adam was supposed to to to speak the word and we were come into existence amen according to those names in the book amen praise God Amen we were supposed to come that way but you see sin came in the picture and that stopped that amen praise God and then Jesus had to come in amen and and defeat and defeat that and come and res and restore that back now we can speak the word amen we can create situations we can create amen he he said speak to that mountain praise God but we have a hard time amen my artificial tooth is hurting or yeah we feel like it's hurting yeah not supposed to hurt because it's artificial and we can't we and we can't heal a toothache we have a hard time just little things like that amen I know it's tough I I I do it too I I run I run to the ointment I run to the doctor I run to the dentist you see thank God for the dentist thank God for the ointment and thank God for the solution amen that that you can rinse your mouth with and it'll help out praise God but originally amen it wasn't so from the beginning you see we were supposed to create we were supposed to be creators amen praise God and you know just like Mary she bore uh Jesus amen God spoke the word Jesus was in Jesus was was was she gave birth to Jesus in that way that was the way that Adam amen was supposed to do at the beginning praise God Amen but Satan of course the who is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he came in the picture and perverted that original way amen and so now we we we are in in in the mess that we're in but thank God for Restoration in this hour oh my we have we just thank God Amen that everything that the canker worm ate and everything that the Locust worm ate and everything amen that all those individual worms ate amen but God said I will restore amen you and my you and me couldn't do it amen but than God that God restored it for us praise the Lord Jesus and now we can grow amen into that in Into His Image in this hour amen there's no excuses in this hour Saints Hallelujah there's no excuses amen we have a open book in this hour amen amen amen and we can read from an open book now uh let me just read to you real quick the the what the word artificial uh means and the word the word artificial refers to something that is man-made amen unnatural or not genuine and it comes from the from the Latin AR artificiali meaning made by Art rather than occurring naturally I thought that was very curious amen because when artificial intelligence we've had artificial intelligence now for several years uh however and I guess it really really kicked in and there was a purpose for it they want to get you very nice and cozy with it but they got the real stuff they just giving you the crumbs right now they got the real stuff and and so but Ma you could just if you don't know what it it is you could go to something called chat GTP just kind of briefly explain it to you you can tell chat GTP hey I have this list right here there's this organized of data that I have can you organize all this data for me in a nice column and a and it'll just fix it for you all you do is just give it prompts can you add an image in between this this portion of the data and this of this this that and that it'll just add it right there it'll do it'll do all kinds of nifty little things uh and and whole lot more I'm sure brother Bob knows more than I than I do about it because uh he's done some Nifty Things with it but uh it's very very very interesting amen amen now that's you telling something a machine to do something for you oh my how about you speaking the word in this hour amen amen that's the original amen that's why Jesus said amen speak to this mountain praise God speak to the storm amen speak to the Rain speak to whatever it is that's bothering you in your life amen and you watch God don't come in on the scene amen if you've got faith in this word in this hour if a machine amen a fallen machine amen that came from the knowledge of TR of of Good and Evil from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil can obey your command how much more God Amen can he obey your command amen when you when you believe his word amen amen praise God Amen he he said he said ask and you shall receive praise God seek and you shall find amen you want to be like his image just continue to read about his image and you'll become like his image amen praise God Amen it's more Beyond than just giving me a picture of of Jesus Amen praying under a tree or something like that amen praise God you become amen that same life in this hour hallelujah amen and you see it's all it is is the the world copying what the original was amen and and I and is is very curious because they're elevating AI artificial intelligence as something uh you know awesome and wonderful you know whatever that phrase is better than sliced bread or something something like that and and yet it couldn't have happened if there was not an original Creator first an original intelligence first yes you see because there can't be artificial intelligence if there wasn't something real first amen amen but yet it's being elevated as something almost Godlike and if we're not careful amen Our Lives amen we if we Elevate ourselves above the word amen you become God Amen and and what and what you say and what you think is is better than what the word than what the word says and that's Dangerous Ground amen the reason why many people have gone astray have gone with their own ideas and and draw a lot of man behind them and and and following them and and pushing their own ideas and where do we find them now amen in this hour so it's very interesting so that word comes from the Latin art artificiales meaning made by Art rather than occurring naturally um man-made it's man-made it's something that's created by humans rather than occurring naturally like artificial light artificial Turf it's fake or imitation something that mimics the real thing but lacks authenticity it lacks authenticity I want you to remember that word amen artificial flavor or artificial intelligence amen praise God you know I've had some drinks and I've had some food that that my it says if it tastes like strawberry it's got some really strong strawberry taste but it it's not made when you look at the ingredients there's no strawberries in it or anything like that it's artificial it makes you think that it's real and and that's the reason why we accept it that's it because the the the whole point is to make us think that it is and it's the real thing and in reality it's not it came from the original praise God it's superficial or insincere something forced not genuine or lacking real emotion amen that's what the word artificial means amen oh my I I I want to be sincere in this hour amen you know what brother Brandon was told in this when he was said the the angel told him he said if you could just be more sincere amen amen and if if brother Brandon was told that how much more Us in the hour that we're living in we think that we thought brother Brandon was the most sincere man that lived upon this Earth outside of Jesus Christ amen especially in that day when he was still alive with us I just don't know it was so sincere that people even thought that he was Jesus Christ amen how much more us should we be sincere in the hour that we're living in ah so it's it's uh it's the opposite of the opposite of artificial is is natural genuine or authentic amen praise God now now let just read you a couple of quotes I do a lot of reading tonight I been trying not to hoop and holler a lot this this evening but uh we'll see how the Lord leads Amen brother Bram says this remember when he talked about the bogus dollar he said of course we know the devil has patterns and types of everything that God has everything that Satan has is secondarily that he patterned off of God Amen so Satan does not have an original idea or let's better yet uh the the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil does not have an original idea right praise God it could not have existed if the Tree of Life wasn't there first absolutely amen amen I believe that with all my heart amen every every everything that Satan has is secondarily that he patterned off of God every bogus thing has has something original original to be made off of if there was no real dollar the bogus dollar would be the original in the first you see and as long as there is a bogus only proves that that there is a real one somewhere amen praise God we see all this fakery in this hour amen when and people act fake sometimes and and people uh uh people look fake sometimes just go to Atlanta and you'll see that brother They look fake and then they act fake and they and and and fake fake fake everybody is being comfortable about being fake but amen you don't have to be fake in this hour Saints amen you can really have something genuine young people you can have something real in this hour something true a true genuine experience amen don't settle for fake don't settle for for artificial amen settle for the true word of God in this hour amen something that can change you from the inside out amen that will cause you to be a better a better son or a better daughter or or a better husband or a better wife amen praise God sometimes we feel like you know sometimes that you feel like you're just going through the motions amen and yet you're comfortable with that but something tells you that it shouldn't be that way ah but still I'm going to just keep going and then the next next month comes I I'll I'll I'll I'll change things later you know I I know as long as I'm getting to church as long as I'm doing you know what I'm supposed to do and what everybody sees from the outside that's what's more important to you yeah but God knows you have a heart problem and you know that God knows you have a heart problem so that's where that's where we want to look to the real real amen come back to the original come back to where you left Christ amen wherever you left him that's where you're going to find him sir amen that's what brother brandham said amen if he's there waiting for you then just come back to him he didn't leave you you left him amen amen praise God and as long as there is a bogus only proves that there is a real one somewhere amen a real one so so when you see something the devil is doing remember God has got something far beyond that amen that he's trying to impersonate here but Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them amen in another message brother bam said and now he promised to do that again the son of man would reveal himself like he did at Sodom the world is in that condition the church is in that condition now now has God kept his word amen I'll will ask you that brother B's asking that question how has God kept his word has God kept his word in your life amen amen that why settle for something fake when you can have something real amen when you can have a a real life genuine life in this hour now with this I am not saying that stop going to chat GTP and stop using things that have to do with AI I'm not telling you that that's not what I'm saying that that that's between between you and God however I I I use Ai and everything that's integrated in in the day that we're living in amen it's becoming more to that that's a technology that that even cars are using that now so that they could track you a little bit I mean but anyways um that's right and so that that that that that technology is there you see and we can't get away from it but you see you have to you have to know how to balance things in your life amen praise God now has God kept his word see he has or not oh we've had signs jumping speaking in tongues prophecy so forth but wait there's another sign he said amen uh oh we have many carnal impersonations that just makes the real one shine amen amen any bogus dollars should have should make the real one shine praise God amen amen you know you know I've I've been to meetings and I just be real we're just family here right I've been to meetings and you can kind of tell you know sister gets up dancing or shouting or something like that and and and I I told my wife you know what praise the Lord but I could you could kind of tell that's just put on you know right I don't know I just have I don't know that's just something that God's given me and I could just kind of spot a fake when you when you see when you see it I don't know but I'm going tell you what I'll tell you what Sunday when I was in there brother brother Aaron was up here getting happy I could tell that was something genuine amen praise God hey the spirit of the Lord moves upon my heart I will dance like David dance as the song said amen praise the Lord Jesus and that's exactly what brother Aaron did so we appreciate that amen praise the Lord but when when and so uh we need more of that sometimes you know you to truly honestly get happy before the before God because he's made us happy amen amen we are supposed to be happy people amen amen we're supposed to be happy people in this hour so that just makes a real one shine see the fake the fake thing see the fake Christian just makes the real Christian shine and so that's the reason why you need it you need the fake Christian to be there in order for the real one to shine right you see brother brandom said that you you won't know a good woman unless there's a bad one you see or a good man in order there's a bad man you see so you need these opposites amen for to be there amen you need negative and positive in order to make a to to for something to show amen amen now I want to ask you this question do you have that Mark of authenticity in your life all right I told you to remember that word do you carry that Mark of authenticity amen authenticity means something authentic something real something original amen amen amen for example if you if you wear Rolex watches I don't yeah can't afford them they are nice but a brother one time gave me uh and I actually have it in my house a fake Rolex watch my my wife knows who it was he's not with us anymore yeah but and this and it's it was It was supposed to mimic that that style of watch you know like I think he told me this is what he told me he said it doesn't hold a it doesn't hold a battery it moves or something with the with like the pulse of your uh your pulse and it moves or something like that I like wow that's awesome and this is this is a flex yeah even the folx was doing [Laughter] that wow wow so it did it ran for maybe a year or two two years and now it's sitting in my closet and it's not running anymore why because it's not authentic it looked just like a Rolex but it was a flex and it's not working now and now even the little the little uh the little areas little lines where where the hour and the minutes are you know they're falling off and and so it's it's almost like that little game where the where the in the water where the little Hoops are coming that's how my watch that's how my watch is now I can shake it and I can hear it and it's supposed to be a Rolex my goodness but you see it's fake amen and when something is fake eventually it'll fall when something is not real eventually it will show its true colors amen you see so not cops am man fake Rolexes they or true Rolexes they come with a certificate of authenticity right man you pay all that money you going to get a you going you want to get a real thing they come with a certificate a serial number and a high and high quality craftsmanship but a knockoff a fake Rolex or a flex may look identical but lacks pres Precision durability and the official verification from Rolex right right and eventually it won't last as long so you want to look like amen the real thing but eventually you're going to either have to buy a real Rolex or buy another Flex cuz yours ain't going to last that long Heen sneakers are the same you know Nike or Adidas shoes have specific designs details uh unique barcodes and and official packaging fake versions May copy that Des design but but are sub but are made of subpar materials and lack the comfort and com and and durability so they won't last this long you see right see I I had I had a a pair of shoes that looked almost just like Jordans like the original Jordans back from the 1980s late 80s and I used to like playing basketball a lot so I knew about Jordans and shoes and things like that I had them sitting in my in my basement the other day and I went out I used them to go walking to go walking outs out in the backyard and everything I put them on and and and and the whole bottom just fell off of as I was walking I said I know these ain't Jordans you see so again that just goes to prove amen how important it is for your life to be something genuine amen because how many people have we've seen fallen in the hour that we're living in in the last several years that we've been people have in who we thought that were just so genuine Christians and we just thought that they they you know everything was going so good for them and now where are they at my and you see so it's it it pays to know amen if you have the goods or if you don't have the goods am I truly a Christian or am I just somebody who just gives lip service do I really know this word the way I'm supposed to know or do I just or or or am I ashamed of it amen Paul said I'm not ashamed of the Gospel amen for is the power of the Salvation amen praise God hallelujah now in Matthew 7 I I told you we just read a little bit but Jesus says this he says be in Matthew 7:15 he says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening clo wolves you know in the hour that we're living in we're supposed to have we're Christians supposed to be Discerning amen amen that's part of that that discernment is part one of the gifts amen but we all have amen a a a uh we all have a little bit of discernment amen praise God we should at least and with the Holy Ghost amen God has given us even more amen and then there's some that have that gift of discernment you see praise God so we should be be Discerning in this hour which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves amen right Jesus says this ye shall know them by their fruits Amen in other words what they produce in their life if they say one thing and and and it doesn't produce what what they are saying or what is in this word amen that you don't have to listen to them oh that sounds strong you don't have to obey them that's right amen Jesus says do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of of thistle in other words do you get grapes from from uh Thorns or or figs from thistles verse 17 he says even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit amen praise God and and and let's just look at the life of brother Brandon amen that that man everything he preached brought me back to Christ amen I don't care what people say I don't care what people say about that cloud I don't care what people say about anything everything that word that he preached didn't never take me to him it always took me to Christ amen praise God Amen you see but then you you bring other preachers and other people that have come on the scene amen if they're pulling you to themselves amen then they're preaching another gospel and they're not preaching the original they're not preaching the genuine the it's artificial what they're bringing amen amen even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down or in other words cut down and it's cast Into the Fire amen wherefore Jesus said this wherefore by their fruits you shall know them amen so be Discerning in this hour that we're living in amen praise God right do not get caught up amen but with with with with with personalities amen but be Discerning discern in this hour amen what's the intention what's the what's the agenda what's the idea behind what's being said what's being done what's what's going on Amen discern amen and use the word as the foundation use the prophet's message amen as a guide amen right the thing is we don't understand the message amen and we don't use brother Brenham already said amen what's going to happen Amen in the in later years to come amen right praise God this thing's got to go back to Mama Rome y amen as sure as thus sayth the Lord is amen so be Discerning of what's going on in the hour that we're living in that you not fall amen into harah harah harah amen and forget what the word of God is saying because it's so easy Amen to just fall into the the the the the motions and and and to the uh uh where everybody is going Y and you're not realizing amen this is taking me away further from God God is trying to strike take us back brother brandom said that the Angels now are trying to run us to the tree of life amen back to him back to the tree of life amen we're letting other things around us amen drawing us away from that amen right be Discerning in this hour I beg of you and I I believe that in the hour in in the next next several years amen you're going to hear that that word even more amen discern discern discern amen praise God now watch what SEC Paul says in 2 Corinthians amen remember our we want the original we want we don't want fake we want the original amen right I'm try to move a little quicker now but I will continue this is Paul speaking and I'm reading from the New Living Translation so that you can understand it a little better but I will continue doing what I have always done this is Paul speaking this will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours these people are false Apostles they are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as Apostles of Christ but I am not surprised Paul says even Satan disguises himself as an angel of Light amen so it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as Servants of righteousness MH in the end they will get the punishment their wicked Deeds deserve amen so we see that Satan can also be he he he can look so genuine so real so so good and so he's an he what did he say Satan disguises himself as an angel of Amen of darkness no no an angel of Light amen and what is God God is light amen and in him is no Darkness at all right but you see Satan can show come to you in that way but yet there will be Darkness within him just like them Pharisees Dead Man's bones inside even though they were showing absolutely right light on the outside you see so it's fakery and in the end fakery has to go out has to be thrown away has to be has to be taken down has will eventually fall and now we're living in an hour in this hour amen is fake fake fake I would I I I would I would I I would just caution you amen everything that you see in the media amen please be Discerning amen there is more psychological things happening right now in this hour that you're living in you don't realize do not take it for for for for face value otherwise you'll be deceived amen oh but I know the message I can't be deceived but is that message in you that's right the message is Christ amen the Christ should be in you and in Christ amen a true experience with Christ amen will cause you to be Discerning amen amen it's okay to support you know and and all that that's okay pray for your leaders and all that that's that's good that that you know Paul talked about that amen but he he said to be established be established amen you're Le leaders one day will come to these doors and they will padlock these doors that's right where will you stand that with your leaders no you got to make a stand at some point amen I'm just being real with you amen now earlier in that chapter Paul said this he said earlier uh he said this I hope you will put up with a little more of my foolishness he said please bear with me and I'm reading from the new l transl for I am jealous for you with the jealousy of God himself I promised you as a pure bride to one husband amen which is Christ but I fear that somehow your pure and undivided Devotion to Christ will be corrupted now he he's talking to the Corinthians back that at that time and history is repeating itself now just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent he's talking to Christians here he's not talking to the drunk man or the or the prostitute outside he's talking to Christians you happily put up with whatever anyone tells you Paul says even if they preach a different Jesus than what than than the one we preach or a different kind of spirit than the one you received or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed right so he's I I I I wanted to read that because all this start started from Genesis chapter 3 amen the knowledge of good the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and and and when you read there it says and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now I want you to take a look at the context here because when they were deceived when Eve was deceived she gave to her husband her husband and her partook and then now what is the consequence of that now what are they doing they add they put something on themselves a fig leaf fig Leaf religion to cover up right the original that God had given them in other words they were using religion something fake something that wasn't that that wasn't original amen for and now they were going to live this way right and you see and God has not called us Amen to that amen praise God you be careful in your life Saints amen what you are using in your life to cover your life with amen praise God if it's not the word of God Amen if it's not amen a genuine experience with God then leave it alone amen we want to be covered with the real amen not fig leaves amen I'm afraid some a lot of us we we we act amen and live by fig Leaf religion y amen amen praise God be careful amen that that you're not just covering your life with spiritual fig leaves but that you truly have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul amen amen the the because the Pharisees they were covering their spiritual death with religion yeah right right and so that's that's that's the that's the that's the trap in this hour because remember in justification amen when you ask when you're Justified amen you you past sins are chopped off right you repent of your sins and they're chopped off now you're entering into a stage of sanctification right amen where you're letting aside amen all the you're dropping things of the world Amen and forgetting smoking and drinking and gambling and and all those things you're trying to you're seeing that those bad habits are not good for you they're not good for your family they're not good for for the church they're not good so you're letting those things go but you let go of all those things and you're not doing them anymore and when we don't continue that is the Trap right there because now you got religion and religion is good but religion is dangerous at the same time amen because you can think I've got it I've done I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm where I need to be I've let go of these things I don't do them anymore I genuinely do not smoke anymore I genuinely do not do these things anymore these bad habits and you stay right there and then you don't go further on into the baptism to a genuine experience with Christ where his life is in you and you're W you're in him and he's in you then that's a trap you're you're you're living just like Judas yes sir because Judas got to justification and sanctification but did not go to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what ended up happening he was a fake yes he was artificial yes right and what ended up happening to his artificial life around Jesus and around and around the disciples around the disciples and around everybody he was just a good Treasurer did not break anything amen he's he had his hair parted really well and I mean he was he was I mean probably the best looking one maybe in in amongst him you know amongst the disciples he I mean he he wore he wore nice smelling cologne and and all that I mean he was probably and I mean he was a good accountant I'm just brother [Laughter] John I mean he was he was the sharpest guy out all of and Peter the one who was foul mouth and he had a bad temper and and uh but but yet God was the one deal Jesus was the one dealing with Peter the most amen because he knew that amen that out of that I can make something out of that amen amen because that's real Peter was just being real you see Peter was just being himself but but but Judas was a fake Judas was artificial amen right and eventually he showed his true colors and what happened to him he went and hung himself what happens to everything artificial it has to die amen amen amen right it has to die and eventually it shows its true colors you see so sanctification I just want to reiterate that point and we'll almost be done here uh sanctification is a very dangerous point to you for you to be in make sure that you have the goods amen make sure that you're full uh genuinely uh full of the Holy Ghost amen praise God because we can be covering ourselves up with the Fig leaves of religion that's right I go to church I read my Bible I I I pray I I do these things amen but you can't discern the word you don't have Revelation and when somebody asks you about what does the word say about this what do you don't know what to tell them that means you don't have a relationship with the word amen I know I say that all the time but it's very shameful amen that you have to call your pastor up for to explain to someone what water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is you should know that for yourself amen you should be able to tell people about it yes sir amen so it's very important in this hour that you become one see Judas was around the disciples they didn't know that he was that way but but the life the tree of life that was there he knew Jesus knew who he was amen praise God so just real quick amen and thinking about artificial amen and Ai and this hour that we're living in uh if we're over Reliant upon AI it can weaken our critical thinking our creativity and and personal responsibility and it and it leads us to intellectual stagnation if if our life is totally relyant you know it reminds me of of if you ever seen that movie Wall-E have you ever seen that movie Wall-E it's a Disney movie A Pixar movie that came out back in 2012 go Google it if you don't if you don't know what I'm talking about but anyways in that movie everybody was living here on Earth but then eventually supposedly they went up to space and everybody with the the the the the everybody was going to live in space and the humans didn't have have to do anything else anymore the robots were going to do everything for them yeah and then life was so good and everything was so amazing and and you saw the humans they were riding around in chairs around and they were floating around and and the and the and the uh robots would come and do pedicures for them and all kinds of things you see seemed like a good life but they were in that life they were becoming very very unhealthy right they were gaining weight they were they were they were they were getting sick they stopped realizing amen what they didn't even recognize what Earth was anymore like what actual dirt was trees they were they were forgetting all these things because of what they were originally supposed to be because they have let they had let robots and things and other things take over you see right so if we're not careful am man that's exactly I don't know what's going to happen in several in the next 10 15 years if we're still here amen that's eventually that's probably where this thing is going to be heading amen at least that's what they want it to be that's their idea for us to merge with with with with with robots and things like that amen but there's a loss of critical thinking diminished creativity erosion of personal responsibility and and dependence on artificial wisdom amen so let's take that and put it in the in the spiritual amen over Reliance on on your fig Leaf religion amen it will weaken your critical thinking about about your own life amen praise God and the things you do and the things you say Amen in Proverbs 3:5 it tells us this that trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding amen and that's what the Bible says don't trust your own heart your own heart is deceitful amen amen trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy own understanding amen all right so if over Reliance Amen on on on on natural uh on artificial intelligence does these things then in the spiritual over Reliance on your fig Leaf religion will also weaken your creativity for God uh which was created for you to be a little Creator here on Earth to create atmospheres amen amen the weakening of your spiritual creat ity diminishes the work you can do for the benefit of others amen praise God right so creativity see we were original We were originally supposed to be creators amen and and in Exodus 35:30 there was a there was a story there uh you can read it on your own but it says this God filled bazel on o and ohav with his spirit amen with God's spirit giving them wisdom understanding and artistic ability to design the Tabernacle amen of Moses you see because they were in tune with with with the word of the hour of that day you see and so make sure that you are in tune with the with with the word of of the hour amen with the word amen and then over Reliance on you now when I say fig Leaf religion is relying upon you upon what you can do you see over Reliance on your fig Leaf religion it will weaken it weakens causes you to not own up to your own mistakes right and to always think you you are always right and the Pharisees always thought they were right amen that's right and Jesus told them in Luke chapter 18 uh when he gave that Parable he said there was a parable of a man praying one time and and he went to the temple to pray and he was a Pharisee and the other person that was next to him praying was a Publican and this is what the Pharisees prayer was he said he stood and prayed thus with him himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican here amen I fast twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess you cannot truly say that that he had the spirit of Christ right Christ is not selfish Christ is not self-centered amen and the Publican stand standing a far off the publicans who was always turned down amen standing AAR off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smoted upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner and I tell you Jesus saying I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted amen amen Paul says in 1 Corinthians just reading here real quick 8 1-3 now regarding your question about food that has been offered to Idols yes we know that we all have knowledge about this issue but while knowledge makes us feel important it is love that strengthens the church amen I'm just reading in the New Living Translation knowledge makes us feel important and that's what artificial intelligence gives us is knowledge makes us feel like you know something right but he says knowledge puffeth up right anyone who claims to know all the answers doesn't really know very much Paul says in verse two amen but the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes amen amen amen I'll finish with with with this I'll have the muss come do you remember you remember that story that brother brandham told about about that man who who went up and to speak at in Chicago I believe it was and and uh and he said that that that man was there to blast you know brother brandham and to blast all the ministers there that that they were of the Full Gospel businessmen and all that and and uh and and he said he went up there and he was and and he would just I'll just read it the way brother Brandon say he says and when he did he had everything wrote out in a book about like that and I'm sure brother Brandon was was maybe saying it was a thick book an intellectual sermon you couldn't have heard a better one but he found out when speaking it it didn't go with Full Gospel people that intellectual ideas he comes stomping up there with his chest out and throwed it out and he even made fun of them and everything but when he did he found out it didn't go so good so he found out he was wrong he closed up his books and walked down with his shoulders down humbly walking down and then there was an Old Saint sitting over a corner punched the one next to him and said if if he would have if he would have went up the way he came down he would have come down the way he went upen if he would have went up to the podium the way he came down he would have come down the way he went up amen he would have come down the way he went up so that's about right brother Brown says so it's so important this Sor Amen to be humble Amen to be be be humble amen have humility amen doesn't matter what you know amen I'm trying to I I I I take it more now more if somebody doesn't ask me then I don't need to offer them my my opinion most of the time most people don't care about your opinion yeah but if they really want to know they'll ask you that's right right and so and so it's important in this hour Amen to know amen do you want something artificial or do you want or you going to stick with the real I want to stick with the real amen the real always survives the real always amen humbles himself the real will take me back to the original amen the fake will always pass away amen amen God's word never pass away praise the Lord Jesus let's stand to our feet amen amen let's just have a word of prayer you can play that softly Lord Jesus we just thank you once again for the opportunity that you've given us Lord to open back the pages of your word I pray heavenly father that you would have your way Lord God through the words that were being spoken Lord may you just help your people Lord

given that story father God on that log that he was riding on saying screaming I'm riding on it I'm riding on it Lord we're we're writing on this word father and this word will take us Lord Jesus to
