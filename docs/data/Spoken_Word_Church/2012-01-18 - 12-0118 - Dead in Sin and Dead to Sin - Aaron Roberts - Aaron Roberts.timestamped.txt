[6:31] Wade and brother
[6:33] Dale and brother Donnie and Zach and and
[6:38] uh in
[6:42] La you know I've heard I've heard of
[6:44] three LA's in my
[6:46] lifetime uh one of them is the City of
[6:49] Angels one most I guess everybody knows
[6:51] that one and the other one somebody
[6:53] mentioned was lovely Atlanta and I told
[6:56] him I said I've never been to that part
[6:58] um I said the Great thing about Atlanta
[7:00] is it has roads leading out that's right
[7:03] and I've never I've never been in that
[7:04] part but if y'all know y'all let me know
[7:06] because uh growing up I hated to go
[7:09] through Atlanta I hated anytime the
[7:11] mention of Atlanta because it didn't
[7:13] matter what road was was on if it was
[7:14] 2:00 in the morning 2:00 in the
[7:16] afternoon didn't matter what was going
[7:18] on it was either car wrecks or road
[7:20] construction we always sat in Atlanta we
[7:22] always sat on the interstate there was
[7:24] didn't matter what road you went on you
[7:25] took if you went to 285 85 was clear and
[7:28] you were stuck on 285 if you went 85 285
[7:31] is clear and you're stuck in traffic it
[7:33] always we never could get through
[7:34] Atlanta on time and it just it was just
[7:37] I just hated Atlanta to go through and
[7:40] then uh brother Dale and them are in
[7:42] lower Alabama so there's the other La
[7:45] that everybody talks about but uh I
[7:48] heard they hadn't hadn't seen her killed
[7:51] anything so we just pray the Lord bless
[7:53] them and maybe they'll get something the
[7:56] next couple of days hope they enjoy
[7:58] theirselves amen and uh they may be
[8:01] listening in so we greet them and if not
[8:05] we'll just I know they'll listen to this
[8:07] later
[8:08] and Wade said that if he didn't like
[8:10] what he heard tonight he could always
[8:12] turn it off so I said well that's no
[8:14] different than people sitting here
[8:15] sometimes people turn you off when
[8:16] you're they're sitting here so you get
[8:18] used to it but no I just I just I love
[8:22] all love you and it's just I
[8:25] wouldn't I wouldn't trade you for
[8:27] anything in the world Amen and yall pray
[8:30] for me I have I've had this told the
[8:32] boys have had it and now they're trying
[8:35] to give it to me and I don't want
[8:37] it but uh before we read the scripture

[8:53] house again this evening Lord we're so
[8:55] thankful for what you've made us

[9:49] come to speak your word we just pray
[9:51] that you come the Holy Ghost come that

[9:57] scripture says Isaiah was said he was
[9:59] man of unclean lips but the angel came
[10:02] down and took the coal and touched his
[10:05] lips Lord that he could speak your
[10:09] word Lord we're standing here the same
[10:12] way tonight we just pray that you come
[10:15] speak I can't do it in
[10:17] myself we look unto you for all things
[10:21] in Jesus Christ's name
[10:24] amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 and verse
[10:28] one it says and you ha he quickened who
[10:31] were dead in sin in trespasses and sins
[10:34] wherein time passed he walked according
[10:36] to the course of this world according to
[10:39] the prince of the power of the air the
[10:40] spirit that now worketh in the children
[10:42] of Disobedience among whom also ye all
[10:47] had our conversations we all had our
[10:50] conversation in time past in the lust of
[10:52] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[10:54] Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature
[10:56] the children of Wrath even as others but
[10:59] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[11:01] love wherewith he loved us even when we
[11:04] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[11:06] together with Christ by
[11:08] Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up
[11:11] together and made us sit together in
[11:14] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you
[11:17] may be seated this evening Lord bless
[11:20] the me of the word and
[11:23] uh just want to speak on a little little
[11:27] thought this evening
[11:30] about going from being the scripture
[11:33] says that we were dead in
[11:37] sin but
[11:41] uh 1 Peter 2:24
[11:46] says who his own bear our sins in his
[11:49] own body speaking of Jesus on the tree
[11:51] that we being dead to sins should live
[11:54] unto righteousness by whose Stripes you
[11:57] were healed right
[12:00] and So speaking of being dead in sins
[12:02] but we are going as the scripture says
[12:05] we are dead to sins and um you
[12:09] know the message thingy man's
[12:12] filter brother random says that he said
[12:14] when you come into this world you were
[12:16] born in sin you didn't even have a
[12:18] Fighting
[12:19] Chance you were born in sin shaped in
[12:21] iniquity come to the world speaking
[12:23] lies within your own Spirit the desire
[12:27] of sin a lover of sin because you were
[12:29] born in sin you didn't have a chance but
[12:33] he said but down inside of you somewhere
[12:37] here you come there was something in
[12:39] there that be to draw right so there be
[12:43] something to
[12:45] draw and in second in 2 Corinthians 5:14
[12:50] says for the love of God constrain us
[12:53] because we thus judge that if one died
[12:56] for all then we're all dead and that he
[12:59] died for all that they which live should
[13:02] not henceforth live unto themselves but
[13:05] unto him which died for them and rose
[13:09] again and so we know that we were dead
[13:12] in sin shaping
[13:15] iniquity a lover of sin separated from
[13:19] God because you I think it's a really
[13:22] really important thing and I know we we
[13:25] all understand this but you know it's a
[13:28] really amazing thing when you talk to
[13:29] people and especially people in this
[13:32] message because they don't realize where
[13:34] they came
[13:35] from because all they can do is talk
[13:37] about how predestinated they
[13:40] are because they oh I'm predestinated
[13:43] I'm predestinated you were separated
[13:45] from God you were lost in and you know
[13:48] because the scripture tells us in
[13:50] Ephesians said we were by Nature the
[13:51] children of Wrath even as others we were
[13:54] just like everybody else you know
[13:56] because there was nothing there was
[13:57] nothing good in me
[13:59] right because when I because you realize
[14:02] just how low down and rotten you are
[14:04] because you were just like everybody
[14:05] else you came the same way because we're
[14:07] all born between Satan and Eve so we all
[14:09] had the same nature we had the same
[14:12] desire we all came the same way but the
[14:15] scripture says but it was God who was
[14:17] rich in Mercy to us see it wasn't
[14:20] anything that I done it was God who was
[14:22] rich in Mercy to me oh yeah because I
[14:25] you know I can stand up I can't uh hold
[14:29] anything that I've ever done but I can
[14:31] but I can stand up and Proclaim what
[14:32] he's done what he's done for me because
[14:35] that's the that's the greatest thing in
[14:36] my life is what he's done for me not
[14:38] what I've done for myself because I
[14:40] can't do anything for myself because
[14:42] most of the time when I try to do
[14:43] something for myself because that's one
[14:45] of the things I want to talk about
[14:47] tonight is because when we try to do
[14:48] things for ourselves we get in the way
[14:51] right but see the thing is is we you
[14:54] know uh brother said that uh told he
[14:58] said there were too many live people we
[14:59] bury too many live
[15:01] people see the thing is is God wants us
[15:05] dead because see he said because he says
[15:07] if you
[15:09] die then the his life can be born in you
[15:12] that's
[15:13] right because Paul said it's no longer I
[15:16] that Liv but Christ that lives in me
[15:18] amen so he reckoned that he was dead so
[15:21] he had to come to a place to realize I'm
[15:24] dead yes Lord as brother random said
[15:27] that old nature had to die
[15:30] that old husband had to die there had to
[15:32] be a death there had to be a
[15:35] separation so that's what we come to we
[15:37] have to realize who we are where we came
[15:39] from and what we have had to come
[15:42] to and I believe lots of times what has
[15:45] happened is there's not there's not
[15:47] enough there's not enough dying out
[15:49] there's not been a
[15:51] death see you've got to come to a place
[15:53] that you actually die
[15:56] out come on Roman
[15:59] Romans
[16:02] 6 verse one says what shall we say then
[16:07] shall we continue in sin that Grace May
[16:09] abound God forbid shall we that are dead
[16:13] in sin live any longer
[16:16] therein know you not that so many of us
[16:19] as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
[16:22] baptized into his death therefore we are
[16:26] buried with him by baptism into death
[16:29] that like as Christ was raised up from
[16:31] the dead by the glory of the father even
[16:34] so we also shall walk in newness of
[16:37] life for if we have been planted
[16:40] together in the likeness of his death we
[16:43] shall also in the likess of his
[16:46] resurrection we shall also be we shall
[16:49] be also in the likeness of his
[16:50] resurrection knowing this that our old
[16:53] man is crucified with him that the body
[16:55] of sin might be
[16:57] destroyed that hence forth for we should
[16:59] not serve sin for he that is dead is
[17:03] freed from sin that if we be dead with
[17:06] Christ we believe that we shall live
[17:08] with him amen knowing that Christ being
[17:11] raised from the dead dieth no more death
[17:14] hath no more dominion over him for in
[17:17] that he died he died unto sin once but
[17:20] in that he liveth he liveth under God
[17:24] likewise reckon ye Al your also
[17:26] yourselves to be dead indeed under sin
[17:29] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[17:32] Our
[17:33] Lord and I I love that scripture I know
[17:35] brother D you know that's the scripture
[17:36] that he always reads at a baptismal
[17:38] service but you know it it really always
[17:42] stands out to me because if we
[17:44] understand what is taking place because
[17:46] we have died with him because he died
[17:50] right and rose again amen that we in and
[17:53] light in his likeness amen go through
[17:55] the same process showing that that by in
[17:58] the baptism showing that that there is a
[18:01] an out sh outward expression of an
[18:03] inward work that that we go down in in
[18:05] his likeness that we come
[18:08] up that when we come to this place
[18:11] because there because there's a definite
[18:13] infilling of the Holy Ghost when you
[18:15] come to this place he said sin has no
[18:18] more dominion over
[18:20] you that that because he is free you
[18:23] have become free also right so that we
[18:26] should because he said he that is dead
[18:29] is freed from sin right that you have
[18:31] become free so as we've come into this
[18:35] place said therefore we are in verse
[18:38] four we are buried with him by baptism
[18:40] into death that like as Christ was
[18:42] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[18:44] the father even so we shall should walk
[18:47] in newness of life right they see
[18:49] there's there's something should take
[18:50] place should be something new right
[18:52] because you're not the same creature
[18:54] that you were before but you become a
[18:55] new creature in Christ Jesus
[18:59] amen he said knowing this that our old
[19:00] man is crucified with him that the body
[19:02] of sin might be destroyed that
[19:04] henceforth we should not serve
[19:06] sin that he should have no more dominion
[19:08] over us for he said for that in he died
[19:11] he died into sin once but in that he
[19:14] liveth he liveth unto God likewise
[19:16] reckon you also yourselves to be dead
[19:19] indeed unto sin but also unto God
[19:22] through Jesus Christ Our Lord right so
[19:24] we have so when we die we don't have
[19:27] we're not under Dominion
[19:30] but you know what we allow just as Eve
[19:33] allowed we allow sin to hold us that's
[19:37] right we allow it's not something that's
[19:40] holding it we because we have by he took
[19:44] dominion over
[19:46] sin because the scripture tells us that
[19:49] that he became sin who knew no sin that
[19:52] we might become the righteousness of God
[19:54] right but we took on his righteousness
[19:56] because he took on our sin right so when
[19:59] he took on our sin and we and we take on
[20:02] his righteousness and then the scripture
[20:04] tells us that death or sin has no more
[20:07] dominion over us the only the only way
[20:09] that it holds us is that we allow it to
[20:11] hold
[20:12] us we because we allow it to hold us see
[20:17] we we are in this P
[20:19] predicament because of ourselves
[20:24] right and so we we are bound by these
[20:27] things because of what what we allow to
[20:30] happen to us we allow it to
[20:33] ourselves but you know what
[20:37] God has made a way right God has opened
[20:41] up the way for us but you know what we
[20:43] have to accept it right see we have to
[20:47] recognize what's taking place amen that
[20:50] God is speaking to each one of us amen
[20:53] there's a and see because we have to
[20:56] have understanding but you have to have
[20:58] faith which is a
[21:00] revelation because as we were speaking
[21:03] of in the Bible study something brother
[21:06] was talking about faith brings us into a
[21:08] realm to change our situation right
[21:11] Faith brings us into a place because you
[21:13] know we create the atmosphere that we
[21:16] live in you know because it's not
[21:19] because you know I preaching on one time
[21:20] talking about our atmosphere and our
[21:22] environment so we can allow our
[21:23] environment to control everything but
[21:26] you know he said that we are many
[21:27] Creator we create the atmosphere that we
[21:30] live in it has nothing to do with the
[21:32] environment that you're in but it's the
[21:34] atmosphere that you create because the
[21:37] Hebrew children see they said we don't
[21:39] know if God would deliver us or not but
[21:41] he said we still won't bow to your idol
[21:44] we still won't bow we still won't belong
[21:46] to your program because we're going to
[21:48] serve God come on and he said even if we
[21:50] die we're going to die believing
[21:53] standing for what we believe and when
[21:55] they when they heated up the furnace and
[21:56] they were going to throw them in see
[21:58] brother M said that because God saw
[22:01] their faith that he had to come himself
[22:04] he could have sent an angel but he said
[22:05] no he said I'm coming myself that that
[22:09] was in the midst of this fire that was
[22:10] hotter than any other time that they
[22:13] were standing in the midst of that and
[22:14] he came down and stood with them right
[22:18] because here they are they're in this
[22:20] burning furnace you know and all the
[22:22] thing it done was it loosed them right
[22:24] it burned off their the the ropes and
[22:27] things that were holding them walked
[22:28] around in the midst of it because when
[22:30] the king looked in you know he saw four
[22:32] of them walking around and when they
[22:34] when they came out they didn't even have
[22:35] the smell of smoke on them there was
[22:38] nothing that had you know nothing they
[22:39] weren't sins when want a sunburn wasn't
[22:43] nothing come on they come out just as
[22:45] perfectly as whole as they went
[22:47] in and there they were but you know what
[22:50] they created the atmosphere that they
[22:52] lived in
[22:54] right and so you have so you and I have
[22:57] the same opportunity
[23:00] we create the atmosphere that we live in
[23:03] we can we can allow we can allow our
[23:05] environment we can allow our
[23:06] circumstances roll control our life ruin
[23:08] our life oh yeah or you know we can we
[23:11] can do something about it because God
[23:13] has given us the opportunity given us
[23:15] the right to do that right there's a man
[23:18] in the scripture that I I wanted to get
[23:20] to this evening in John chapter
[23:26] 5 Terence said I start at 7:30
[23:30] keep doing all right I'm going to run
[23:31] out of time my check's going to be
[23:34] worthless
[23:36] tonight but
[23:40] anyway I'll get back to the
[23:44] church but anyway
[23:47] uh um John chapter 5 here and I want
[23:52] to
[23:54] I I don't I don't know if any does
[23:57] anybody know brother Murphy want
[24:00] WR uh he's he's a Chinese brother he's
[24:03] in the message goes brother B Church
[24:05] he's one of the first ones that were in
[24:07] the in the message come through and u i
[24:10] I love to hear him preach it and uh he
[24:12] was preaching on this some time back and
[24:14] and it just and it really stood out to
[24:16] me of of what he what he was saying and
[24:19] um I got to meet him a number of years
[24:21] ago just a precious brother I think he's
[24:23] been here to the church before years ago
[24:25] but um I just I just loved hearing
[24:29] preaching you know for a long time I
[24:31] told Brother Ernie one time brother
[24:34] Murphy he would preaching Chinese but he
[24:36] wouldn't preach in English because he
[24:38] had such a problem with his English and
[24:40] he said he just and he would try to
[24:42] testify and the problem was is the
[24:45] scriptures he could remember when they
[24:46] would come to him they come to him in
[24:47] Chinese and he was sitting there trying
[24:49] to translate and you know it's just a
[24:51] you know a a big difference there when
[24:53] you're used to the Chinese language and
[24:55] trying to speak in English audience and
[24:58] you know he just he just had this
[25:00] problem and and I told him I said you
[25:01] know if if you get to a place and I told
[25:04] Brother one time I said if you watch
[25:05] brother Murphy I said when he just
[25:07] relaxes I said he gets so tightened up
[25:09] he gets so tense he gets so nervous I
[25:11] said if you ever watch brother Murphy
[25:13] when he gets just when he relaxes and
[25:15] the Holy Ghost will come and he just
[25:16] relaxes I said he can
[25:19] preach right but he gets so but he gets
[25:21] so conscious about what he's saying and
[25:24] I a lots of times he'll starts quoting
[25:25] stuff we know the scriptures that he's
[25:27] trying to quote I mean he may not get
[25:29] them right but at least we know what
[25:30] he's trying to say and you know he gets
[25:32] all all bound up with things but anyway
[25:34] uh I just every now then I get to I get
[25:37] to listen to him hear him preach and he
[25:39] just does a wonderful job because after
[25:40] so long you know he just finally was
[25:42] able to get over the the
[25:45] psychological issues of being able you
[25:47] know because you get so nervous at it
[25:48] and he was preaching and I I just love
[25:51] this story
[25:52] and and it's about
[25:55] the uh the man at the pole of Bethesda
[25:59] but
[26:01] um verse uh chapter 5 of John and it
[26:06] says and after this there were a feast
[26:08] of the Jews and Jesus went up to
[26:11] Jerusalem now there is a there is at
[26:14] Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool
[26:17] which is called in the Hebrew tongue
[26:18] Bethesda having five forches in these
[26:21] lay a great multitude of impotent folk
[26:23] of blind halt withered waiting for the
[26:25] moving of the water for an angel went
[26:28] down down at a certain season into the
[26:29] pool and troubled the water whosoever
[26:32] then first after the troubling of the
[26:34] water stepped in was made whole of
[26:36] whatsoever disease he had and a certain
[26:39] man was there which had an infirmity 38
[26:43] years when Jesus saw him lie and knew
[26:46] that he had been now a long time in that
[26:50] case he sa unto him will thou be made
[26:53] whole the infinite man answered him sir
[26:56] I have no man when the water is troubled
[26:58] to put me into the pool for while I am
[27:00] coming another steth down before me
[27:04] Jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed
[27:07] and walk and immediately the man was
[27:09] made whole and took up his bed and
[27:10] walked and on the same day was the
[27:13] Sabbath right now I know we we've heard
[27:17] this story many times but you know what
[27:19] what struck me about this story was
[27:21] here's this
[27:22] man and he had this he had this
[27:25] condition and this the scripture says
[27:28] there was a great multitude of infinite
[27:30] folk and infinite means weak or
[27:33] powerless there was something that was
[27:35] holding each one of these people there
[27:36] was a great multitude there and they and
[27:39] they knew that at the troubling of the
[27:41] waters because at a certain time that
[27:43] angel would come and Trouble the waters
[27:45] right and they would stay there and he
[27:47] said that you know he kept trying to
[27:49] come for 38 years and brother BR said he
[27:53] probably wouldn't die of his condition
[27:55] you know whatever it was that was was
[27:57] holding him you know he said it just
[27:59] kept binding him and he would try all
[28:01] these years trying to make it to the
[28:03] pool when the water was troubled and he
[28:04] said you know there's somebody always
[28:07] come in front of him always stepped in
[28:08] front of him into that pool of water and
[28:10] received their healing but you know what
[28:13] he had great faith because brother R
[28:14] said other people left people got
[28:18] discouraged but you know he stayed there
[28:20] for 38 years you know Abra you know we
[28:23] talk about Abraham and his great faith
[28:25] that he stayed you know believed in the
[28:26] promise for 25 years
[28:28] well here's a man stayed 38 years
[28:31] holding on to One Promise because he
[28:33] knew that there was an angel that could
[28:35] take care of his problem and he laid
[28:37] there and he continued every single year
[28:40] right there why because he was waiting
[28:42] on something to take place and he kept
[28:45] and he kept standing there and he just
[28:48] waiting and waiting and the angel come
[28:50] but you know Jesus knew how long that
[28:52] man had been there Jesus came walking by
[28:55] that man the man because here was
[28:58] waiting on the angel to trouble the
[28:59] water but here was the one that created
[29:02] the Angels right here was here was
[29:05] almighty God in flesh that's right and
[29:07] come and spoke to him amen he was
[29:09] waiting on an angel But Here Come Oh God
[29:11] Almighty in front of him and said wil
[29:13] thou be made whole right see he was
[29:16] waiting on something to take place but
[29:18] the word of God was right in front of
[29:20] him made flesh right he was holding on
[29:22] to a promise but the promise was made
[29:24] flesh right in front of him standing
[29:26] there speaking W thou be made
[29:28] right oh yeah
[29:30] amen he said I'm trying Lord I'm trying
[29:34] because sir when every time I try to
[29:36] make it into the water but I can't make
[29:38] it I'm
[29:39] trying but see Jesus saw the great faith
[29:42] that he had he said take up your bed
[29:45] right see you don't have to worry about
[29:47] looking at the angel troubling the water
[29:50] because I've come because you have great
[29:52] faith and see sometimes we get our eyes
[29:55] fixed on something sometimes we're
[29:57] looking for God to do something in a
[29:58] certain way come on but you know what
[30:00] here he comes in front of us and speaks
[30:04] right and you know what we miss God
[30:07] right you know the other night I was
[30:09] laying in bed and I was thinking about
[30:11] how God has come by my life and you
[30:14] know you know you look back on things
[30:16] brother dick and you say how can I be so
[30:22] stupid God has been right there in front
[30:24] of you he was speaking to you you know
[30:28] sometimes it's like that little story
[30:29] about the man that was you know they
[30:31] were trying to rescue him from the flood
[30:33] and they kept saying the Lord's going to
[30:34] rescue me I'm waiting on the Lord to
[30:37] rescue me right you know and the boat
[30:39] came by and the helicopter came by and
[30:42] he drowned right right and he got upset
[30:45] with God cuz God didn't rescue him right
[30:47] he said I sent a boat and a helicopter
[30:51] right why you blaming me
[30:54] right see we miss God Amen yeah see was
[30:58] trying to get to the troubling of the
[31:00] water come on see sometimes and it
[31:03] really struck me see people people are
[31:05] so wrapped up in things that are taking
[31:08] place see sometimes people get blinded
[31:11] completely blinded by brother brandom oh
[31:14] M they're blinded by the angel
[31:16] ouch but you know what they missed God
[31:19] because brother Brandon was trying to
[31:21] point us to Jesus Christ he's trying to
[31:23] get us to see God Almighty
[31:26] amen see see it wasn't it wasn't the
[31:29] great ministry that God had the
[31:31] relationship that brother Brenham had
[31:33] with Jesus Christ it's to see you and
[31:36] him together right to see who you are
[31:39] right it's a wonderful thing to know who
[31:41] brother Brandon was but God wants me to
[31:43] know who I am
[31:45] amen that's it we can we can lay beside
[31:48] the pool all day long for
[31:51] years
[31:52] blessing but you know what Jesus will
[31:55] walk right past us and speak to us come
[31:58] are we willing to catch his Voice come
[32:00] on do we see who what's taking place
[32:04] come
[32:05] on see sometimes we we think things are
[32:07] just going to come and and happen a
[32:09] certain way and we'll miss
[32:13] God because you know we don't we don't
[32:15] like the person right we don't like his
[32:19] shirt oh my we don't like his language
[32:22] oh my come on we don't like his hair or
[32:26] the lack thereof
[32:30] heard somebody say that his hair was in
[32:31] Retreat mine's mine's in the what they
[32:35] say that the the rear is
[32:44] advancing one these days we don't have
[32:45] to have haircut anymore
[32:48] BL you see sometimes we miss God and
[32:51] God's right there in front of us God
[32:54] speaks to us right and sometimes it we
[32:57] look back he like you know I've missed
[33:00] God because God was trying to do
[33:02] something for us and sometimes it's we
[33:06] continue to see that he's there speaking
[33:08] to us and it goes on and on right and
[33:11] sometimes we catch it and it's like Lord
[33:14] forgive
[33:15] me because I've been so stupid because
[33:18] you spoke to me and we don't recognize
[33:21] you right we don't recognize sometimes
[33:24] we come to church we don't recognize
[33:26] that he's here come on
[33:29] we get we get wrapped up in other things
[33:31] and that's what Satan is here to do he's
[33:33] here to Blind you right he's here to put
[33:35] things in your mind he's here to he's
[33:37] here to interrupt all that he can so
[33:39] that God can't speak to you
[33:42] right he's he's here to mess it all
[33:46] up but you know that's what that's what
[33:49] the the ministry has been sent for and
[33:51] that's what he's come to do is to help
[33:53] you oh yeah just like when Daniel you
[33:56] know Daniel Prayed for 21 days trying to
[33:59] get an answer yeah but you know what the
[34:02] answer was on its way from the very
[34:04] first day that he put his heart to
[34:06] understand the angel was standing there
[34:08] right the angel came to bring him the
[34:12] understanding and sometimes we think
[34:14] well God's not hearing us sometimes we
[34:17] don't see in that other realm what's
[34:18] taking place come on we don't see what's
[34:21] taking place sometimes we need to just
[34:23] take a step back and think about
[34:26] it because you know what if we have we
[34:28] have set our heart to understand he give
[34:30] us the understanding that's right he's
[34:32] coming to bring you the understanding
[34:33] that's
[34:34] right sometimes but sometimes we have to
[34:37] get ourselves out of the way amen and
[34:40] sometimes it's
[34:42] us and not him it's always
[34:48] me oh my amen this is from the message
[34:53] birth pains
[34:57] speaking
[35:02] on he says not talking about natural
[35:05] normal typing the spiritual now it's
[35:08] talk about bringing a
[35:11] baby because you know that that's what
[35:14] natural typing the spiritual see we got
[35:16] to come to a place that we come to to a
[35:19] new
[35:20] birth
[35:22] right you know and
[35:25] because um W was taking you know he was
[35:28] writing down the names of people of
[35:30] family members and and ones in in this
[35:33] church that have not reached that place
[35:36] yet you
[35:38] know I believe it was Paul you know he
[35:41] said and he ministered in his church and
[35:44] he wanted because he wanted every person
[35:46] in his church to be born again right and
[35:49] I think St Martin was the same way that
[35:53] he that he that that was his
[35:55] desire see
[35:58] because if you've reached this place see
[36:01] it solves so many
[36:04] problems why while people have so many
[36:06] issues and problems they're not
[36:09] born heard heard brother say one time
[36:11] said we wonder why people don't grow up
[36:13] in church how can they grow up they
[36:15] never been born come on
[36:18] Amen there's no growth until you're born
[36:21] that's
[36:22] right but he said and the message
[36:29] this is from in birth pain he says but
[36:32] normal type in the spiritual now we find
[36:33] out that it's fully born when the baby
[36:36] usually now when the water breaks you
[36:38] don't have to do very much about it but
[36:40] when the blood comes you don't have to
[36:42] do much about it but in order to get
[36:43] life in the baby you've got to give him
[36:45] a spanking and make him yell
[36:49] out and now he now education speaking
[36:52] about he just try try to type these
[36:56] thingss and he said says now you take
[36:58] that some kind of a shock maybe you
[37:01] wouldn't have to spank him but just
[37:03] shock him a little the very idea of him
[37:06] being born sometimes will do it grab him
[37:09] Shake him if he don't start breathing
[37:12] spank him a little and then he yells out
[37:14] in unknown tongues to himself I guess
[37:16] but see anyhow he's making a noise and
[37:20] if I yell and if I think if a baby is
[37:23] born just by still birth with no sound
[37:26] no emotion
[37:28] that's a dead baby that's what's the
[37:30] matter with the church today the system
[37:33] we got too many stillborn children
[37:35] that's right they need a gospel spanking
[37:37] you see so then to wake them up to bring
[37:39] them to themselves so that God can
[37:41] breathe the breath of life into them and
[37:45] that's what we find that's so
[37:49] true and so he goes on he says he said
[37:53] so no it is a seed's birth the old seed
[37:55] must die before the new one can can be
[37:58] born so therefore death is hard anytime
[38:01] it's so painful it's distressful birth
[38:04] is the same because you're bringing life
[38:06] into the world it's
[38:14] painful
[38:21] amen and this is from um basis of
[38:25] Fellowship brother continue on what
[38:27] constitutes the natural birth
[38:29] constitutes the spiritual birth if a
[38:30] baby's born and he's still born he
[38:32] doesn't cry there's no emotion to him
[38:34] what's the matter with him he's a dead
[38:37] born baby that's what's the matter with
[38:39] the churches today what's wrong with
[38:41] our what's wrong with our Pentecostals
[38:44] we're bringing forth too many dead born
[38:46] babies exactly right yes sir we are
[38:49] that's exactly right why do
[38:52] we what do we do with a baby if he's
[38:55] still born like that you just take him
[38:57] by the heels and raise him up and give
[38:59] him a little posterior protoplasma
[39:01] stimulation just as hard as you can and
[39:04] that fixes him up and if anything the
[39:06] church needs tonight is a good old
[39:07] fashion fashioned gospel spanking with
[39:10] the power of the Holy
[39:13] Ghost so what what is taking place is he
[39:17] saying see that's what what has happened
[39:20] is we have too many people that are uh
[39:24] stillborn because you have to have life
[39:28] life thank you
[39:33] brother there has to be a
[39:36] life there has to be some kind of
[39:38] emotion there has to be some kind of
[39:40] something because you have to display
[39:43] the
[39:44] life come on you know I don't I don't
[39:46] believe everybody has to run in the
[39:47] aisles and speak in tongues because I've
[39:49] seen a lot of that and and believe
[39:51] believe me from the my
[39:54] background blessing I've seen I've seen
[39:56] all kind kind of
[39:58] things and you
[40:01] know you you see people that they can
[40:03] run the aisle speak it in tongues jump
[40:06] jump
[40:07] pews run into things I seen one lady hit
[40:10] a piano so hard I thought it' knock her
[40:12] teeth
[40:14] out just dance in the spirit and up and
[40:19] gone but you know what it doesn't change
[40:22] them they can go through a lot of that
[40:24] but you know what you you have the
[40:26] spirit of of God the life of God it
[40:29] makes itself Dome it makes itself alive
[40:33] you display that life right and he said
[40:36] that's what's wrong when we have so many
[40:37] people that are still born amen see you
[40:40] can you can be all around the message
[40:43] but you know what the life has to be
[40:44] made known you have to have that baby
[40:46] and it has to breathe and it has to
[40:47] function and it has to do the things
[40:49] that babies do right and it's got to
[40:52] come to that place and that's what has
[40:53] happened to a lot of a lot of people
[40:55] they've been around this message but
[40:57] they not come to that place they're not
[40:59] de they're not manifesting the life
[41:02] right the life is not coming on display
[41:04] righten and it's got to come on on
[41:06] display we can see these
[41:09] things we can see who we are because
[41:12] it's got to be made known amen but for
[41:15] that to take place you've got to come to
[41:17] a place where there's a death come on as
[41:19] as brother Bon was speaking he he was
[41:22] speaking and the message hidden
[41:24] life I like told this St all this I
[41:28] started putting things together and then
[41:29] it was like no I'm going to change it
[41:30] and trying to figure out which way to go
[41:32] but you know in the message H life
[41:35] brother R was speaking of
[41:38] um Aaron's Rod when he was bringing
[41:41] Aaron's rod in because he was wanting to
[41:44] show the children of Israel what tribe
[41:46] was going to be chosen and you know he
[41:48] he took each one of those rods and he
[41:50] laid it before the Arc of the Covenant
[41:52] there and and he said that God would
[41:55] make manifest in in the rod that he
[41:57] chose of the tribes he would show who
[42:00] that he had chosen right and he would
[42:03] stood there and he he said you know they
[42:05] they put Aaron's rod in in front of the
[42:08] Ark and then it came forth and he says
[42:11] now when that old dead Rod was brought
[42:13] in there and laid in the presence of God
[42:15] himself what happened it budded it
[42:17] blossomed it yielded fruit showing that
[42:19] we born in that Rod was off an almond
[42:23] tree and when it was cut off it died and
[42:26] when man was cut off from God he died
[42:28] spiritually but once brought into the
[42:31] presence of God before in the place of
[42:34] God before the presence of God it comes
[42:36] to life and he yields life he yields
[42:38] blossoms he yields fruit Jesus come to
[42:41] the tree to look for fruit one on it it
[42:43] had everything but fruit and that's what
[42:45] the matter with our churches today we
[42:47] got everything but fruit we can shout we
[42:49] can speak in tongues we can argue the
[42:51] scriptures we can teach our theology but
[42:53] when it comes to fruit bearing the tree
[42:55] is very lean what is the fruits of the
[42:58] spirit love joy peace longsuffering
[43:00] gentleness goodness patience it shows
[43:03] many is still out there under the first
[43:05] altar you're still open to the public
[43:07] you're still listening to to hear what
[43:10] John's got to say about it what the
[43:11] neighbors will think or something for
[43:13] yourself but once inside the veil and
[43:16] the curtain is dropped you're head and
[43:18] God through Christ see amen he says
[43:22] notice what a beautiful picture of The
[43:24] Sinner laying in the presence of God now
[43:26] this Ro laying there it was refreshed it
[43:29] was fragrant brought the uh fragrance of
[43:32] the Blossom and it yielded fruit the
[43:33] buds came forth what a beautiful type of
[43:36] that is given Earthly speaking the first
[43:38] thing that we have to do before we can
[43:41] have a crop we have to have seed and the
[43:43] seed placed in the ground will yield its
[43:45] fruits is that right now the first thing
[43:47] we have to do is receive Christ now the
[43:50] tree had to be an almond tree to start
[43:52] with and Christ you have to receive him
[43:55] before you come into this place and then
[43:57] in the presence of this great God then
[44:00] these things take place right amen so
[44:03] we've got to come to the place because
[44:05] see we realize that even though we were
[44:08] born in sin shapen in iniquity yet we
[44:11] are
[44:13] predestinated we have seed of
[44:16] representation right see we were dead
[44:19] just like that almond tree it was dead
[44:21] that Rod was completely dead cut off but
[44:24] you know what there come a time when
[44:26] that Rod came into the presence of God
[44:28] because it was chosen and it was chosen
[44:30] to show a purpose to show something to
[44:33] the people and when it was late in in
[44:35] front of the Arc of the Covenant and
[44:37] that presence came it brought forth what
[44:38] is exactly what it was supposed to bring
[44:40] forth because inside that that Rod was
[44:43] it was an almond tree so it done exactly
[44:46] what it was supposed to do was supposed
[44:47] to bring forth seed and it was supposed
[44:49] to bring forth Blossom show its fruit
[44:52] and that's exactly what it did and
[44:53] that's what exactly we are supposed to
[44:55] do because he said by their fruit you'll
[44:58] know them right and so if you are
[45:00] because we're dead and sin and
[45:02] trespasses and cut off but when we come
[45:04] back into life when we come back into
[45:06] the presence of God then we bring forth
[45:08] the fruit of God come on we bring forth
[45:11] the fruit of the spirit right Lord see
[45:14] but God wants us dead so that he can
[45:16] bring forth because he can bring forth
[45:19] his fruit when we get in the way
[45:22] right see God is wanting us to get out
[45:25] of the way so that he can do what he
[45:27] wants to do
[45:29] amen
[45:31] bless hope this is all
[45:34] right I have a little I have a little
[45:37] story
[45:42] on you know brother R uh Brother D was
[45:45] speaking about brother
[45:47] R been preaching he said you know he
[45:50] said doesn't God doesn't impute sin to
[45:52] dead dead
[45:55] people that's right right you know who
[45:58] is who is the blessed is the man is the
[46:00] man that's
[46:01] dead he doesn't he doesn't impute sin to
[46:05] him you know you been preaching on on
[46:07] this for a while I was sharing this with
[46:08] Wade and got a little story to tell you
[46:12] actually I got a couple little stories I
[46:13] want to tell you but this one this one
[46:15] was come to mind when when Brother D was
[46:17] preaching the other other day and I
[46:20] don't know is I don't know if youall
[46:22] ever heard the story about the man who
[46:25] wasn't and uh
[46:28] it was this was during World War II and
[46:31] um it was called operation mint meet and
[46:34] it was it was a British
[46:37] operation and
[46:40] um in uh I believe in the
[46:43] 4043 the Allies were in North Africa you
[46:47] know they had the campaign in North
[46:48] Africa and they had taken U that part
[46:51] and they were wanting to go into uh
[46:54] Europe and they were trying to get into
[46:56] into France and everything and uh church
[47:00] here was looking at it looking at the
[47:03] map and the Germans knew where the
[47:05] Allies were trying to get to so they
[47:06] fortified the area they really
[47:08] entrenched theirself in Sicily because
[47:10] that was the place that you would want
[47:11] to go to as you believe trying to cross
[47:13] the Mediterranean there and Church Hill
[47:16] stood there and said only a fool would
[47:18] realize that it you know only a fool
[47:20] would realize that it wasn't Sicily you
[47:22] know because everybody wanted to go to
[47:24] Sicily that's the reason the Germans
[47:25] were entrenched there he said a fool
[47:27] wouldn't pick
[47:29] Sicily and they were sitting over there
[47:31] trying to figure out how they're going
[47:32] to cross into into um into Sicily and
[47:36] trying to advance the the operations and
[47:38] this young man came up with a plan he
[47:40] said what we need to do is get the
[47:41] German to make the Germans think we're
[47:42] going somewhere else and they'll move he
[47:44] said well how are you going to do that
[47:47] this young man come up with an idea they
[47:49] had tried this before and it didn't work
[47:51] because they tried to fool the Germans
[47:53] and Germans didn't bite so they thought
[47:54] well we we'll try it again and
[47:58] uh what what their what their plan was
[48:00] the man came up with was uh they wanted
[48:03] to take a a a man dress him up as an
[48:07] officer they were going to float him in
[48:09] the in the ocean and have uh papers on
[48:14] him that they would think that they the
[48:17] Germans had gotten secrets from the
[48:19] Allies well they found a man that U had
[48:22] had died of pneumonia and his family
[48:25] gave the body to the government to and
[48:26] they made him up as a a royal marine
[48:28] officer and he had these all these
[48:30] papers on him and they stuck him in the
[48:32] ocean and the Spanish picked him out out
[48:34] of the ocean and brought him
[48:37] in well right after they they got him in
[48:39] the Allies started to run around with
[48:40] their spies and they were trying to
[48:42] figure out where this man went because
[48:44] they said there was a plane crash this
[48:45] plane had went down this man had drowned
[48:47] he had secrets on them we need him well
[48:50] then everybody sent all the word went
[48:51] back to the Germans that hey we got this
[48:53] man over here that's got
[48:55] secrets well they took came in they
[48:57] examined the body they took all these
[48:59] papers they made copies of it and the
[49:01] Germans were looking the Allies were
[49:03] wanting the British were wanting their
[49:04] officer back so they made copies of it
[49:07] they sent it back to the Spanish the
[49:09] Spanish gave them back to the British
[49:11] and the British took the papers and
[49:12] realized that they had made copies of
[49:14] all the papers the Germans had the plan
[49:17] and he said no we just got to
[49:18] wait well they asked ger they asked
[49:21] Church Hill they said Church said what
[49:22] are we going to do if this don't work he
[49:24] said we're going to take that man we're
[49:25] going to float him in the ocean
[49:27] again we're going to make this thing
[49:30] work well they went out there and they
[49:32] they got they got the papers in the
[49:33] Germans started looking at them well as
[49:35] soon as Hitler saw the papers he knew it
[49:36] was real they're going to Sardinia in
[49:40] Greece and he said well how do you know
[49:42] that because one of the high ranking
[49:44] officers in the British army had written
[49:45] to another man and he said one of these
[49:47] days I'll meet you and we'll have
[49:48] sardines well obviously that was code
[49:50] that they were going to Sardinia it had
[49:51] to be where they were going Hitler
[49:53] believed it melini said no they argued
[49:55] over Hitler said no were moving the
[49:57] Germans so he moved them and he set them
[49:58] up because they were going to
[50:01] Sardinia well in all of this the the
[50:04] British had piled all their men to go
[50:06] right into
[50:07] Sicily well Hitler believ that was that
[50:10] was just a front they were not going
[50:12] there well as soon as German the Germans
[50:15] packed up and started moving the Allies
[50:17] went right into
[50:18] Sicily and see and it all became because
[50:20] of a dead
[50:23] man they said a dead man don't tell lies
[50:27] he don't tell
[50:28] secrets that don't mean he don't carry
[50:31] them but say that's what they needed
[50:33] they needed a dead man right and that's
[50:35] what God wants God wants somebody that's
[50:37] dead why because the man couldn't tell
[50:40] couldn't mess the plan up all he had to
[50:42] do was floating in the water he was
[50:46] dead and you know there's a great
[50:48] Monument built to this man and you know
[50:49] he's really a highly recognized man that
[50:52] they were talking about for many years
[50:53] they didn't even know who he
[50:55] was but you know what it took a dead
[50:58] man to and it was one of the greatest
[51:01] greatest men in all of World War II
[51:04] history that it took a dead man to win a
[51:06] great
[51:07] campaign see a lot of people think you
[51:09] know we look at Patton and all of these
[51:11] Eisenhower and all this one of the
[51:13] greatest uh movements operations ever
[51:17] took place took of dead
[51:20] man they used the dead man to bring it
[51:22] to pass and they tore up Hitler soad
[51:26] that twice after that one time we had a
[51:30] a uh a beach landing and they had papers
[51:33] they were showing Advanced movements and
[51:35] things that were going to take place and
[51:36] Hitler didn't believe it because he got
[51:38] burnt by this and one time they had uh
[51:41] where they were showing the Allies were
[51:42] doing the paratroopers where the
[51:43] paratroopers were actually coming in and
[51:45] they the Germans had actually had
[51:47] Advanced uh copies of our plans of what
[51:50] we were going to do and and Hitler
[51:52] believed that it was a fake he actually
[51:54] thought that because of he got burned so
[51:56] bad at Sicily that when he actually had
[52:00] real plans he thought they were planted
[52:03] to fall into German hands so to see if
[52:05] they would buy it
[52:07] again and so it took it took a dead man
[52:10] to bring this to
[52:12] pass one of the greatest one of the
[52:14] greatest things that took place was a
[52:16] dead man and see you know God wants
[52:20] wants us to be
[52:21] dead so we think sometimes I can't do
[52:24] anything you just die out to yourself
[52:28] and let God move he'll take care of it
[52:30] he'll do what needs to be
[52:33] done see if we can if we can stand there
[52:35] and realize who who we are if we can
[52:37] just die out to ourselves oh
[52:40] yeah then he can live he can be made
[52:43] manifest right if we die ourselves
[52:48] right I have one other little story I
[52:51] want to share it I'm going stop
[52:59] this is
[53:01] Napoleon said Napoleon's war machine was
[53:04] drafting large numbers into his army and
[53:06] a young father was about to be inducted
[53:09] his wife and children were gathering
[53:10] around him as tearful as scene as Can Be
[53:13] Imagined and in response to their
[53:15] desperate situation on of the young
[53:17] man's neighbors stepped
[53:19] forward one of the uh man's neighbors
[53:22] stepped forward to take his place in
[53:24] response to their desperate s as the
[53:26] laws and customs of the time allowed
[53:29] took his
[53:30] place later on this man who volunteered
[53:33] in place of the young father was killed
[53:35] in battle several years later after his
[53:37] death the draft once again made its way
[53:40] to the same Village and the father P
[53:42] picked out for induction into the army
[53:44] this time however the young father
[53:46] boldly stepped before the draft board
[53:48] and produced a parchment which he
[53:50] displayed tearfully for all to see it
[53:54] read this man perished upon the
[53:55] battlefield of ravoli in the name of his
[53:59] substitute signed Napoleon
[54:05] bonapart there was a man that that took
[54:07] his
[54:09] place and this man instead of being
[54:13] separated from his
[54:15] family and having to
[54:18] die he had someone to come and take his
[54:21] place that he could stand before him and
[54:24] say listen I've already dieden
[54:27] I'm already
[54:29] dead why because somebody took my
[54:32] place you know we can stand and say the
[54:35] same thing it's no longer I that live
[54:37] now come on but it's Christ that lives
[54:39] in me right because he's tooken my place
[54:43] and I can stand and boldly and boldly
[54:45] Proclaim I'm dead come
[54:48] on you see I can still tell the devil
[54:51] why because I I'm dead and my life is
[54:53] hid in
[54:55] Christ I have I have I'm fortified
[54:59] behind the word right and there's a
[55:02] scripture there you know speaking
[55:07] of I'm not going to finish I'm I'm going
[55:09] read this right
[55:12] quick I told him I was going to
[55:16] finish I promise I'll be done here in a
[55:18] minute you want
[55:21] do but I but I love this because I want
[55:27] in 2 Corinthians chapter
[55:32] 5 says
[55:42] it says verse 15 says and that he died
[55:46] for all that they should which live
[55:48] should not henceforth live under
[55:50] themselves but unto him which died for
[55:52] them and rose again therefore henceforth
[55:55] know we no man after the flesh y though
[55:57] we have known Christ after the flesh yet
[56:00] now henceforth know we him no more
[56:02] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[56:04] a new creature right all things are
[56:06] passed away behold all things are become
[56:09] new and all things are of God who ha
[56:12] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[56:15] and hath given us to us the ministry of
[56:19] recognition of reconciliation to it that
[56:22] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[56:24] and himself not imputing their
[56:26] trespasses to them and hath committed
[56:28] unto us the word of
[56:32] reconciliation so we know
[56:35] no Christ by the flesh he said and now
[56:39] he said therefore any man being Christ
[56:41] he's a new creature and he's been GI
[56:44] he's given us the word of reconciliation
[56:47] that we that we come to this place to it
[56:50] says to reconciliation to restore
[56:53] relationship or Harmony to
[56:57] cover see we've come to this place where
[57:00] we've received this this ministry and
[57:03] the word has been given to us to bring
[57:05] us to this
[57:06] place and the scripture goes on to tell
[57:09] us there in in chapter 5 he says for we
[57:11] know that if our Earthly House of this
[57:13] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[57:15] building of God a house not made with
[57:17] hands Eternal in the heavens for in this
[57:20] we grown earnestly Desiring to be
[57:22] clothed upon which our house with our
[57:25] house which is from Heaven if so be that
[57:28] being clothed we should not be found
[57:30] naked for we that are in this Tabernacle
[57:33] do grown being burdened not that we
[57:35] should be unclothed but clothed upon
[57:38] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[57:40] life right so we have received this
[57:43] message of
[57:45] reconciliation we've received this word
[57:48] and because of this word that we have
[57:50] received because we're in this Earthly
[57:52] house Paul Paul speaking of this Earthly
[57:54] house because we have something to
[57:56] clothe us but put to put on his he said
[57:59] that mortality that this Mortal may take
[58:01] on immortality that we may be swallowed
[58:04] up of Life why because that all that is
[58:07] dead because all of this that is enmity
[58:10] will be swallowed up in life right
[58:12] because we are groaning because we
[58:14] should have this groaning in us because
[58:16] if we're born again there's a groaning
[58:18] to be
[58:19] changed there's a groaning to be changed
[58:22] to be carried on to the word into the
[58:24] fullness of the word amen
[58:26] amen and so the scripture tells us there
[58:29] in in end of uh chapter 4 there
[58:34] in he says for verse 15 says for all
[58:37] things are of your sakes that the
[58:39] abundant grace might through the
[58:41] Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory
[58:44] of God for which cause we F not but
[58:47] though our outward man perish he said
[58:50] but the inward man is renewed day by day
[58:54] for our light Affliction which is but
[58:56] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[58:59] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[59:01] while we look not at the things which
[59:03] are but at the things which are not seen
[59:07] which are seen but that things which are
[59:09] not seen for the things which are seen
[59:11] are temporal but the things which are
[59:13] not seen are Eternal amen so we can see
[59:18] that when we have these things see
[59:19] there's a groaning taking place but you
[59:22] know what we're being renewed the inner
[59:24] man is being renewed day by day
[59:26] so even even though when we get older
[59:29] because we're still going through the
[59:30] aches and the pains and the groanings of
[59:32] this old flesh but the inward man is
[59:34] being renewed right see I look at that
[59:36] when I when I read that I read that as a
[59:38] promise why because it's what he said he
[59:40] said the renew he said the inner man is
[59:43] being renewed day by day he's taking
[59:46] place so what is it he said he said what
[59:48] is it he said your glorified body is
[59:50] being born around built around your Born
[59:53] Again experience so that you have
[59:55] received this born again experien
[59:57] because the new man has come in so it's
[59:59] taking over this outer man there's an
[1:00:02] enmity taking place but you know what he
[1:00:04] is succumbing to the will and the of the
[1:00:08] word that is placed on the
[1:00:12] inside so we are coming to this place
[1:00:15] thank you Lord but you know what it
[1:00:17] takes our faith it takes a revelation to
[1:00:19] see who we
[1:00:21] are but you know what it's taking place
[1:00:26] every day we might get a little older a
[1:00:28] few more aches and
[1:00:33] pains like brother Mark you can take
[1:00:35] your
[1:00:36] vitamins drink your
[1:00:40] teas nothing wrong with that but you
[1:00:43] know what we're still getting older
[1:00:45] right but you know what there's only one
[1:00:47] thing that's going to take take you
[1:00:49] through and that's the word amen the
[1:00:53] inner man being fed
[1:00:57] just like brother brother ra speaking of
[1:01:00] the chief there you know he said which
[1:01:02] one which one of the the black and the
[1:01:03] white dog he said which one wins he said
[1:01:06] the one I feed the most
[1:01:08] right he said see if we feed on if we
[1:01:11] feed on the things that the inner man
[1:01:13] can fight that he can feed on that he
[1:01:16] grows you know what the outer man
[1:01:18] becomes weaker and weaker amen that we
[1:01:21] can bring this this flesh this spirit
[1:01:24] that we have under sub jection that's it
[1:01:27] bring it under the subjection of the
[1:01:28] word amen and create the atmosphere that
[1:01:31] we want to live in that we can be who we
[1:01:34] say we want to be right who the word
[1:01:37] says we are and then we can make that
[1:01:41] manifest amen I'm I'm so glad to know
[1:01:44] who I am amen but you know what it's a
[1:01:46] day-to-day fight let's all stand this
[1:01:49] evening but it's a day-to-day fight but
[1:01:52] you know what we have to every single
[1:01:54] day you got to stand up and say I'm a
[1:01:56] take what's
[1:01:57] mine I'm I'm going to be what God has

[1:13:01] may I may not have it exactly right this
[1:13:04] is pretty pretty close but brother Roy
[1:13:06] Shrewsberry
[1:13:08] sister was in a I believe was in a car
[1:13:10] wreck and she was really badly injured
[1:13:14] and the doctors pretty much just give up
[1:13:15] on her because they didn't think she
[1:13:17] would uh be able to
[1:13:20] survive and she was in the hospital and
[1:13:23] brother Shrewsberry come to see her
[1:13:26] and she came in there and said Roy sit
[1:13:29] down so brother sit down beside
[1:13:32] her and said brother Bram came to me in
[1:13:35] a
[1:13:36] dream and walked up to me and said
[1:13:38] sister it's thus saith the Lord you'll
[1:13:40] not die but you'll
[1:13:42] live and she said what do you think
[1:13:43] about that he said I believe it's from
[1:13:45] the
[1:13:47] Lord but she just laid in the hospital
[1:13:49] they do anything for her but she started
[1:13:51] getting better so the doctors decided
[1:13:53] they w't have to do something for her
[1:13:55] they want to take care of her oh cuz she
[1:13:57] was going to survive so anyway um she
[1:14:00] had to go in for surgery and I know they
[1:14:02] end up putting a plate in the front I
[1:14:04] believe it's in front of her head they
[1:14:05] had to fix out cuz the forehead was all
[1:14:07] messed up she had other surg and
[1:14:10] somebody in brother shrewsbury's family
[1:14:12] is a nurse and they want to pray the
[1:14:14] prayer cloth on her they couldn't pin it
[1:14:15] on her and they didn't want to put on
[1:14:17] her on her gown because they were they
[1:14:19] might take that off of her and they
[1:14:20] didn't know exactly what to do or where
[1:14:22] to put it and she has medical she had
[1:14:25] medical tape and as they were Wheeling
[1:14:27] her back through there her Barefoot was
[1:14:29] there so she put medical tape on the
[1:14:31] prayer cloth and slapped it on the
[1:14:33] bottom of her foot before they W her
