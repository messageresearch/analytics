========================================

[Music] [Music] holy holy holy [Music] amen and amen and i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to galatians 4. we'll read the first seven verses and then we'll jump over to to verse 19 and pick up the thought just remember pray one for another that the lord would bless remember brother bob he's up blue ridge or whatever how you call that up there he's up there preaching today so remember that brother luis is in buffalo that right bufort preaching so remember them and pray that the lord would would bless and take care of them and do everything um and we also get in touch with brother bob but he is to minister this coming wednesday for us so we try to keep everything going in order and line up getting the the ending of this year as we do now not the january and february but the ending of this time of the bringing it in to the 50 of the church coming forth on this day 50 or july the 4th 1971 bringing it all into order there and that's what i call it the ending of this and we're going to begin anew because i believe in that i believe in moving forward and keeping on going don't you terrence has announced he's remember sister johnny she's facing an operation and they're moving there from one hospital to the other one or backwards or four they really don't know yet to get everything straight to be able to do but just praise the lord would bless she really needs our prayers because you know the uh the operation is not a uh small one so just pray the lord would bless her and take care of her and you you just keep her in your prayers okay galatians 4 and father we thank you that there's a day of grace and time as our brother was ministering unto us about your grace your unmerited favor to each one of us and to be able to lord to take your word just open the pages and to read it and to see your grace and what it is to each and every one of us and how that you've manifested yourself in many ways down through time to bringing it to that position that we can all depend upon you and to walk in the light of your grace bless those that are not here today remember brother allen and sister anna there brother house mr audrey for all the others brother colley brother dardy lord we miss all of these sister johnny sister gene we miss these lord and we pray that you would just restore unto us these that are sick we know that we're all getting older but that has nothing to do with it because we rest in you not in time we love you and we thank you have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in jesus name amen galatians 4. now i'm going to have to pick this up in two or three parts maybe but we'll see how it works out now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all all right now paul is explaining the fact of law and grace and bringing it down to the position to understand and see what we are see but we're we're we're ours as long as we're the children we differ nothing from a servant we've been through these messages before but we're under tutors and governors until a time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law watch now to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons okay and because ye are sons in other words the reason your sons reason that you are in an adopted stage is because of what god has done for us and putting us in place now so listen wherefore there aren't no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ amen so now let's drop over just pick our thought up to the 19th verse chapter 4 19. my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you in other words they had come if you get the whole background of the story the galatians were having trouble under the basis of the law all right and in other words they were wanting to lean back to keeping the sabbath days keeping this day or keep that day or keep this thing or or wear this clothing or eat this food or take this certain day off and all of this that and the other they were having trouble doing that and paul is trying to explain to him and that's why i started over here with the adoption see bring you into the family by the new birth then pick that up and go on with it and to see that we no longer have these things because we're different now remember the story if you don't don't forget this whole point now listen we're going to cover the bondwoman and the free woman but now we're going to have to cover it under the natural before we can cover it under the spiritual see because under the natural jew you had two things now we've got to bring that over into the new testament what i said we may have problems getting it to where we can understand but listen my little children to whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by one made the other by a free woman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory or type or a shadow all right for these are the two covenants the one from mount sinai which generous to bondage which is agar in other words hagar coming on over into the point and this agar is mount sinai in arabia an answer to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but jerusalem which is above is free now not jew that's a natural okay all right you see where we've got to pick it up which is the mother of us all right for it is written rejoiced thou barren that bears not break forth and cry thou that travel us not for the desolate hath many more children than than she which hath and husband now we brethren as isaac was none of what are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now all right see people are still arguing and fussing well we're supposed to do this we're supposed to do that we're supposed to keep these days we're supposed to do you know they're still arguing over it but what's nevertheless what sayeth the scripture cast out the bondman and her son for the son of the bondman one woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we're not children of the bondwoman but of the free now who said who was the first one that said cast out the bond child that's what we'll deal with today so you may be seated the lord had his blessing for the reading of the word all right now get my point listen very carefully to the point there was two nations that developed out of abraham you technically can say one developed out of abram all right because that would have been ishmael and the other developed out of abraham after the name change after the promise and and things like that and that's well and good to keep your thoughts in mind because see then you can declare that one is by uh natural lineage in the natural lineage to abraham through through hagar there was no promise of a child there was promise of a nation promise over the things we'll read in a minute this nation and all like they will promise that too uh you know ishmael gets his nations they're over there right now and all but see there is a an israel there now that is still not lined up in the promise so you're going to have to pick up the point of seeing what paul is talking about there is two natural nations right ishmael on one side isaac on the other side all right and both of them have the promise under the point as i said about ismail gets promise of land he gets promise of of great things to take place and great nations come out of ishmael but see the promise come through isaac all right and see we have to pick that up to to understand now now get the point now the flesh man or isaac you know he was flesh let me put it this way both seed both seeds now come from abraham amen whether it be the jew or whether it be the i don't know what you call them over there now the palestinians the this out of the order the people of their the lineages coming down from that side but remember both of them comes from abraham you call you didn't go through as i said for abram was this one over here through ishmael and abraham's that's good but remember one thing you and i are not jews so what is paul talking to the galatians about see why is he talking to them as a natural people he's explaining the natural laws the things of who they are he's telling the the the uh galatians you know you're this you're that you're you're the seed of promise whether it would be that you would wind up being from ismail or from isaac you've got promises for both but one of them will linger back or lean back to the flesh the other will lean to the promise all right in doing that then see there's your developing of two nations that you have aware right now fighting each other all of those little nations around there in one way or the other are in relation now notice where i said it's on one way or the other they're all in relation one to the other connecting to abram or abraham they connect back to abram and the bases that that they come from the flesh of abram now the two seeds that we cover so you get into that we'll cover that later going through it and all but remember both children come by a natural sex act amen right yes right whether it be ishmael or whether it be isaac amen all right see we look at isaac as being a promise and that's true but still where did he come from amen where did he come from he come from abraham amen right because that's where that that you keep your thoughts in line but then when you get to the book of galatians paul is not necessarily dealing with israel and isaac he's dealing with the children of promise all right because remember now watch what i'm getting at follow the point and then hold this point both children came from the same man right ismail came from abraham isaac came from abraham amen all right but now we've got to get down to eventually to where we can cover the one seed which is christ because abraham and abram and abraham would be two seeds so then that's why paul is trying to explain to the galatians that they were trying to lean back to the law to do that they wanted to follow the law they wanted to keep the law they wanted to do those things and paul is saying why are you doing that don't you understand that you're trying to lean this way you're trying to lean that away you're trying to lean back to whether or not you come from ishmael or isaac why are you worried about which one you come from oh but but we are the children of of of ishmael all right according to the korans and the writings and the things you know who the promised son is isaac no ishmael amen your arabs and things are claiming the ishmael to be the promised son and isaac to be the bad guy you know to come up you know right so you understand it's it's a great situation to look at it but yet to try to understand it in the order of understanding and and not just drop off this see you'll drive well we're the seat of promise we're only at the seat of promise through jesus christ and paul is not talking to or dealing necessarily with the isaac and ishmael situation to the galatians he's dealing with the galatians as being gentiles the bride of christ now as i said then you've got one man fathering both nations right amen come on as i said you can pick up all you want to and play with it we do it we believe it is will come from one isaac come from the other but it's only in the basis of whether it would be abram or abraham it's still the same guy the same guy's the daddy of both of them but now here's the catch to it that we will get to in another message or so down the road not so with the woman amen not so with a woman and the woman you got two different women that's right they get babies but you got two different women one of them is through hagar the other one's through syrah all right so now you've got two women to deal with all right and that's why he's covering it see that we have this situation that the bondwoman is to be cast out all right now that bondwoman being cast out is not the bride of christ or even the natural point of of trying to understand it's just laying it in order to get it right you got one man two wives i don't care what you think about the promises is through this and the promises is through that you can get into all of that but paul ain't even covered because remember paul's talking to the galatians the galatians were were the point of gentile situation because of where they're coming in at are the bride of jesus christ paul is talking about the bride amen right he's talking about he's only using that as a type he's only using uh abraham as abram or abraham or whatever as a type or a shadow something to look at to where you can get a he's talking about whether or not you right here in lula georgia today can decide which side are you on because remember we just read in verse 26 that jerusalem which is above is a mother of us all amen all right but see you get in the mind of looking and wondering what is paul doing he's talking to the galatians he's talking about the bondwoman and the free woman all right but yet what does a bondwoman and free woman have to do with christianity you know what does it have to do with you as christians because we are not the bondwoman of the free woman we're the bride of jesus christ because paul is covering the natural as the bondwoman as being hagar and the natural as sarah as being the free woman right but neither one of them applies to you and i we're not jews we're born again christians we are the bride of christ not the bride of abraham all right getting you to look at the bible in a different situation and to try to understand it why would it be talking to the why would he be talking to the galatians and telling the galatians you desire to be under the law when the galatians are not the jew are naturally you know they are they was in there there was jews in all of that back there in the early parts but paul's talking to the bride of christ i've been pondering this for months as to us to thought because it will eventually wind up to see that the seeds shall not be out with a shuck brother brown said this is an unusual thought seed shall not be air with a shop well see there has to be a division then come along somewhere that you'll see that that has to divide between and when you do you're going to see one going one way and one going another and in doing that you're going to see that when the prophet made that statement it was perfectly right because first off thinking in your human mind it should not be the point of saying the seed shall not be aired with a shock it should be that the shock shall not be aired with the seed that should be the correct statement that the shuck shall not be aired with a seed all right you can go that line i can carry you through that line and it will come out and we will but he's saying these seeds shall not be air with a shock right that's the titles to the message all right then in doing that that seed shall not be air with a shock because the shucks going one way for certain but the genuine bride's going another way then it will fall in line and i'll drop back on this later on then it will fall in line to see that the shucks go into the tribulation i don't care what they are that's right they're going to the tribulation amen but the seeds not going to the tribulation seed's going in the rapture the royal seat of abraham who is the royal seat of abraham the bride of jesus christ so now you understand what i'm saying the book of galatians is not writing about the jews and their lineages and their doings and what they're doing there and and all because he's not writing to them about that he's writing to born-again believers who are in jesus christ that he said that to an adoption children heirs right what was he covering the heirs the people the bride of jesus christ is what he's talking about see i want to know why the bride's not going with us why the the free woman's not going with the bondwoman amen because both of them are wives of abraham both of them by children to abraham see then abraham had two had a separation in that point that naturally he brought forth ishmael through hagar no promise purely sex act sorry to say it that way but it's plain language so it must be plain we're old enough to understand nothing in promise the only promise it was that that god looks down and all right let's let's go on let's let's get the point but who i asked you who was the first one that talked about the bondwoman and what was to happen so let's get in the bible and and study a little bit go back to to uh go ahead and pick up number one brothers all right which would be genesis 21 and sarah saul the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham monkey now she saw sarah saul hagar the egyptian which had bore abraham a son ishmael now what wherefore she said unto abraham cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the one woman shall not be heir with my son even with ishmael or isaac now listen why would sarah be so adamant when she first said she saw she was looking and and uh you know uh in other words they claimed really that basically uh isaac was a little long about weaning from his mother maybe three or four years old you know as a background story to a lot of different things and all like that and and ishmael he kind of made fun of him because the ishmael was born to hagar before isaac was born to sarah okay are you following me so in doing that sarah looks at it and remembers sarah is the one that set this whole story up she set up the situation for hagar to bear abraham or abram if you want to hold them keep them a son and she said then i'll take that son which was the right of all of the do it i'll take that son and i'll bury it unto myself and said abraham now that'll fulfill the promise to you but abraham he said no this ain't exactly working because what i got now is a problem now listen i've got within me the ability the seed etc to bring forth but said i don't have a wife to bring forth so sarah said okay take hagar she'll be a wife and she'll bury you a child but said remember now i'll take that child to me because i can't have any and the law of right was for that child to come to her and she would raise it as her own child all right so sarah is getting in line pretty good we throw off on sarah we throw off it she done this she set up that she set this situation up you know what god turned around and said listen to her no wait a minute now she's in trickery she's in all kinds of things he's doing all kinds of situations and god says okay now abram abraham said just listen to her she gets all upset when isaac comes forth as a child to be weaned and ishmael starts making fun well you know probably probably if the truth was known hagar was making fun at the same time too you know because of the sun i mean just put it all together but it doesn't matter just get it straight then she started making you know he started making fun and you know what would have happened had sarah not come up with this idea you would still have two lineages and you'd have a problem in israel but just remember one thing that i tried to explain to start with we're not dealing with that fact of isaac in israel i mean it's on the basis of whether or not they're jews or what we're doing we're seeing what is paul relating to you and i am why is it in the message people then especially years ago they're beginning to get away from a lot of but a lot of it was legalistic preachers right all you could do would beat the women over the head for this that or the other and all of these things and all of that was in the situation but listen cast out this bond woman and her son said now listen abraham we got a child now come on by then they had a child said we got a child we got a promise you told me that god promised you a son you told me that he promised a son through you here we have the son we no longer need hagar we definitely don't need ishmael cast them out now what does god say okay 4 4 she said unto abraham cast out the bonds woman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be air with my son even with isaac the thing was very grievous in abraham's site because of his son he loved ishmael that was his first son but god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad in other words about ishmael and because of thy abundant one woman in all that sarah has said unto thee hearken unto her voice for is in isaac shall thy seed be called now watch him and also of the son of the blind woman well i make a nation because he is thy seed okay now show me whether abraham ever denied the seed he doesn't to this day they may deny him but as i said the korans and the things all of those doctrines over there they have ishmael as the promised son the jews have isaac as the promised son that's what the argument is that's what the killing is over that's what the wars are over because they're two different nations but from the same man but not from the same woman see one of them's a bondwoman the other's a free woman all right bondwoman is hagar but the free woman it's sarah amen she was the one the promise was to come through and through abraham was to come through abraham now whether it be abram and then abraham i keep doing that because people they'll do it to you you know they say well he don't know what he's talking about he don't keep it straight well i keep repeating it where it'll be straight you got one abram abraham whatever name you want to call it you got one guy with two seeds you say wait a minute no no we ain't got into christianity yet come on when you get into christianity you've got to come to one seed into galatians 3 16 which is under thy seed which is christ it ain't neither jew or gentile they don't have nothing to do with it that's what paul is explaining he's explaining then what are you arguing about these things what are you trying to figure out which lineage you're from you're trying to figure out whether you're ishmael or isaacs and said they don't have nothing to do with it right then because neither one of them is the promised son isaac was not the promised son the lord jesus christ is the promised son isaac was the natural promise because it has to be a natural why because it's a natural on each side you got one man with two seeds that's why it's not you don't look at christianity maybe sometimes the way i do i know it i'm crazy in in my thinking but i look at something and i think well hey there's there's two seeds but we spent so much time talking about one seed well okay let's get to one seed right like that so the only way you can get to one seed right is not isaac nor is one but it's jesus christ galatians 3 16 until i see which is christ singular see paul is explaining to born-again christians that they're trying to be under the law they're trying to be under their uh uh you know they're doing their thing they want to lean back to that they want to go to the circumcision paul had trouble with them all the time you know with timothy and the different things of circumcision amen but see we look at it and say well what is he talking about paul is not talking about the jews in the he has to because he's backgrounding it he's typing it but he's not talking about that the galatians are are ishmaelites or or canaanites or who do i answer they are what they are paul is explaining the new birth right amen come on are we back over here and as i said isn't it a very odd thing from there in genesis that sarah wanted to cast out the bondwoman when she was the one that helped set up the situation that the bondwoman came into existence maybe one of these days we're going to find out the bride of jesus christ is very important to god and he does listen to her maybe we're going to learn one of these days what our position is and where we're to live that we are the bride of jesus christ we're not jew gentile samaritans whatever we are we're not any of those things right we're the born again believer amen the only free woman that there is is a born-again believer in the bride of jesus christ and see israel is in the isaacs and the situations in that sarah and hagar is only tops and shadows to come to see who we are paul is talking to us today not to the jews back there amen tell me you that desire to be under the law tell me you that desire to uh well i won't do this i won't do that i won't do it i can't do this i can't do that legalisms that's right you think your legalism is what perfects you no the blood of jesus christ is what makes us all what we are how is there any hope for a gentile to wind up being the bride of christ don't you ever think like that don't you ever think about what god done to get me and you amen amen it looks like he done everything wrong he listened to hagar he said well no god didn't well he told abraham to listen to her but see we don't follow the story we don't line it up then we want to take hagar to things and just chuck her out the window but remember when hagar when sarah and hagar had their dispute and hagar went her way abraham had to send her out god found hagar under the tree with ishmael and god told us that he will bring forth a great nation nations will come out of this man to go on back to be under subjection to sarah read your bible that's all i'm doing be under subjection to sarah because see sarah had the idea now we throw off on her so much about that she persuaded abraham i don't think it was a lot of persuading going on i think abraham saw a time to get his wife he had one wife and couldn't get no children so he's trying to figure out how to get a child that god had promised him right now he promised him he's going to have a child he didn't tell him right off it's going to be by sarah he left him a long time before he ever come to him and finally said sarah how this child well this is after sarah's done had the child now sarah's saying behavior to god you get abraham to cast this woman out because she can't be there he says he's not talking about who is she talking to she was talking to abraham but abraham was under her god and he was telling her and she said no that ain't the way to work it out so this is the way to work it out cast out that bond first off get rid of the bondwoman then what's your first off in christianity justification see if you don't have time to do nothing else get the messages on the seed shall not be air with the shuck there's two or three of them and listen to them if we get time we'll go through those things of talking about because in the story of brother branham using those things he's using sarah as the husk which was the the uh methodists and the different things is being described by the prophet as those things are going on but this has got to be described here this is the point that i'm wanting to get out first hagar had the idea to get a child by i mean sarah had an idea to get the child by hagar and they got it but yet abraham began to realize about that time hey wait a minute this is not my promise i got this by flesh well if you don't see it then you maybe need to but you get into legalism you're automatically going to the flesh do this don't do that eat this don't eat that wear this don't wear this do this see that what do what is it legalism paul is explaining to the born-again christians that it didn't work with isaac and ishmael neither one of them brought the promise isma was the natural promise yes but he was not the seed because isaac was from the seed of abraham ishma was from the seed of abraham two seeds you've got to break that down to get rid of one of those or something's got to take place because you can only have one seed in christianity you don't have two seeds in christianity there's no point of it that's why you don't believe in the two souls the two lords the two this or two that they always got to have two in the message what would paul be saying you galatians tell me you that try to have these seed and that seed and that seed or how many seeds because in galatians you only got one seed galatians 3 16 of thy seed which is christ he said what are you driving at i'm talking about me and you here i'm not talking about the jews back there that's the only the type or the example of it we are the bride of jesus christ one seed but yet why do we wind up with so many of them i hope you don't go wrong on me listen but you got your two lords your two souls your two this you always got two and paul is constantly trying to get rid of them two things and he's saying it didn't work in the natural because what i wound up with in other words god said what i wound up with is two different kingdoms two nations and they're sitting over there right now fighting each other over the land both of them claiming the promise as being theirs right but it's unto thy seed which is christ do you understand what i'm saying why is paul used it what's he doing with the galatians he's not preaching to the jews not naturally there were jews there there were people in all of those because the jews were the biggest portion of the christian realm as we call it up into the first church age right so don't misunderstand me as to what i'd say when i say they were not they were not jews the jewish kingdom was to end it back there when jesus christ came and gave his life and brought it forth and it brought forth a spiritual kingdom all right and unto thy seed which is christ paul two or three hundred years i mean i don't know exactly how long maybe 30 40 years here from the time and paul is explaining the new birth right come on are we in the scriptures god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lead because of the bond woman why because see the here's the the free woman is wanting to throw everything out and he says don't be grieved about it because of thy because of thy bond woman and all that sarah has said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called all right now watch him tell me that and also other son of the bundle i will make a nation because he is thy seed see the way that most people are trying to bring it they try to bring an uh uh israel you know a children of israel through isaac and throw away throw away the ishmael that's always been the point get rid of this you know the ishmaelites why they have a promise there will be a lot of those people be given eternal life at the white throne judgment right a lot of the jews a lot of the people because over there in israel right now what are you going to call it come on they are both the seed of abraham that's right if you go over there and stand out there you'll hear them in the in the day the horn they'll get out and they'll blow it at certain times of the day well that's a call of prayer the ishmaelites are the ones that's calling the prayer right sister barbara it's not the jews that are calling the prayer is it it's the ishmaelites the ones from hagar because they believe that they're the promise they believe ishmael was the one that isaac was to offer i mean that abraham was to offer up back there see they changed the whole story around what have we done with it tell me you that desire to be under the law why do you want to go back to those dates and times and fees seasons and doing paul said i'm scared of you brother brown said i'm scared of your experience now i got this in my notes right here if you want to he said i'm scared of your experience unless i've bestowed labor and vain in other words trying to get to the galatians to see that it's not ishmael and isaac that's only a types and shadows it's christ it's the new birth we don't need to try to find out our lineage even if you found out which side you're on what good would it do right what good would it do for you to find out you were a jew because paul says later on in the scripture it's not a jew that's a jew outward but it's a jew that's inwardly the new birth makes you a jew inwardly puts you into the correct position of the free woman's child because now let's take that for a minute see the bond woman hagar and her doing the bondwoman well what about the free woman you and i are the free woman right sarah is not the free woman no more than than is than isaac was the seed of promise it's all in jesus christ amen see the bride of jesus christ is the free woman she's not a bondman she's a free woman by promise sabra was by promise the true savior would come the child amen get into the christianity with it get into the real thing instead of just thinking about two nations well see then when you start thinking of two nations you've got to automatically do away with one of them because you're knowing that much of it is right in it but it won't work you can't do away with anything that's right the ishmaelites are over there they got their promise there'll be some of them given eternal life at the white throne judgment oh yeah but you know what israel as a nation is a nation with god but israel is not the promised nation the promised nation is the bride of jesus christ the free woman amen that comes by promise see we're not jews we're the bride of jesus christ and that's what paul is trying his best to explain to him did you listen to the reading of the scriptures let's see but after that faith has come we are no longer under a schoolmaster for we are all the children of god by faith in jesus christ come on i'm in four or three and three and 26. for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek listen there is neither bond nor free there is neither male or female for we are all one in christ all of that back there was just types and shadows to come to you and i right and if you be christ then you are abraham's seeds singular and heirs according to the promise then what is he starting to describe listen to him and i say that to air as long as he's caught he's explaining adoption right stature of perfect man adoption coming so we've been lord of all and you're under tutor schoolmaster same word governor same word unto the time appointed of the father even as we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world we were all sinners lost but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons adoption was originally placed to be to the jews because they were the children of god but they teared down that right they lost their right of sonship when they turned down jesus christ and crucified him so they're no longer in promise of the line of adoptions and things but it turned to the gentiles see what and because your sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abby father see adoption galatians i mean romans 8. wherefore there are no more a servant but a son if a son then an heir of god through christ right explaining adoption the statue of a perfect man the great development not of a natural jew that was not who he was talking to he was talking to the galatians which was to be the bride of jesus christ see the bride of jesus christ is the free woman that's why it doesn't say see it says the seed shall not be aired with a shuck it doesn't say that shuck won't be out with a seed because there is a redemptive part to israel that they will come forth and be given eternal life and different things but yet they will never come into the position of free woman they'll always be israel now listen follow what i'm saying and listen israel will always be the bondwoman because you can't be the free woman jesus christ set that up with the birth of he when he come into this world and made a way for to die for our sins and made us his children his offspring his errors who is it talking about why is he talking to the galatians about our ship or what to do how children are to be how you're supposed to raise them and things he's not talking to the israel he's talking to the true israelite which is the true israelite is the bride of jesus christ the free woman so the bondwoman will never be air with a free woman but isn't it odd who put her out who come up with the idea get rid of the blind woman which was sarah and sarah if you'll listen to the prophet's message and you'll see sarah represents the methodists and things coming down because you've got this and representing this as representing that listen but you've got a very odd statement when you get over there to where that brother branham says even mary was not the seed you remember that marrow was not to see why the seed was in mary sarah was not the seed seed was in sarah where did this where did isaac come from comes from sarah right ishmael comes from hagar well still hagar is top of the bat of the uh lutherans coming forth and see when you get to going then then you'll see why the prophet said the seeds shall not be aired with a shovel right amen but the main thing is what he gets to the life of everybody is covering it this the shuck is going to the tribulation now not sarah and and not lutherans and wesleyan methods there are the bride of jesus christ they're not going through the tribulation well because the jew i mean the the justification same case and baptism in the holy ghost already finished by now they won't go the new birth is for the royal seat of abraham which is the bride of jesus christ count yourself the honor that you're sitting in amen that's all i'm trying to say the bible is not talking here in galatians of jews and gentiles that's what he said he said neither jew and a greek neither bond they're free but it's in jesus christ that all things rest we are the royal seat of abraham by the new birth and that's why it comes down to be one seed then because we're the children of abraham one seed now remember the story of what i'm getting out of you listening when you got the story started you got an abraham and isaac you've got an israel and a hagar you got all kind of stories coming down but you got it to one thing that's two seeds but as long as you got two seeds you've got i trouble mean to be wrong i just mean to be straight when you've got two lords you've got a problem that's the only thing that i tried to explain to those people back there 20 40 years ago about the two lords and you've got two lords you've got two gods because you've got to have a god for each lord that's sensible so there is not a god for isaac and a god for ishmael but there is a god for the bride of jesus christ one seed singular which is christ you just think about what you are you're not a jew it's not a judas where it's a jew that's inwardly you're the new birth you have the part of being christ in the new birth right you're born again now you're jews inwardly not outwardly i don't want to be a physical jew i want to be what i am amen but to realize what i am that's what i'm trying to get you to see the bible is not written this far we say the jews it's written to the bride of christ it tells about israel and all of her doings but it's telling it in types and shatters of typing what we are now amen we're his offspring come on is that the book of acts where paul said that was on mars hill and said we are his offspring we're the children of god amen we're the born-again believers of god why do we need a book of rules to live by well brother don't you think it's good to be good no i think it's good to be born again if you get born again you'll be good right that solve the problem if you get born again it takes care of whether you're good or not because it's not how good i am it's how good he is i like that one where he said he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people in the sheep of his pastor amen all of that on predestination all of that on the choosing all of that things are standing now for you to understand this day to try to get it to the right place who is the bondwoman and who is the free woman i don't want to be the bondwoman's child i don't care if they give me all of israel i don't care if they give me all of that land i don't want to be that i want to be of the free woman which is jesus christ coming and bringing us by promise see the natural bond woman brought a man by sex the spiritual brings it back by new creation makes us the children of god amen his offspring are you listening just trying to get a thought to you and then we'll pick it back up maybe in another message or something because i want you to see it who is paul talking to that the air as long as he's a child he differs with nothing he's a child you know i mean you go over there and you pick up one of them little bitty little bitty arab and you shake him up down you know you got a little kid you reach over and get a junior you shake him down you got two little kids i love both of them it doesn't matter but see in the finality it comes down to prove which one is to be what by the fact of what that child will do i don't want to be just a a a p a people of a tribe of israel which tribe are we we got to tell us we got that you got arguments the over the tribes and the things you know the 144 thousand and this that no i want to be part of the bride of christ i want to be of the free woman what about a man like abraham having to take his son ishmael and throw him out he loved him he wanted to keep him he throwed him out why because the free woman said it that don't mean nothing to you but it certainly means a lot to me because i'm going to stand up for that bride of jesus christ i don't care how much you argue and fuss with me about all these things you're not going to get nowhere downing the bride of jesus christ but uplifting christ you're on my side because i believe in the spiritual more than the physical amen because if you're listening to the physical abraham had two seeds he planted one in one woman one in the other one he wound up with two children out of that you can't deny the point right but god kept separating separating he would even have to use sarah to separate with to say do this and do that he kept separating until he wound up with isaac but that was not his promised son that's the promised son in the natural jesus christ is his promised son and by the new birth we become the children of god now we can fit into the galatians tell me the you know they do is that about the air as long as he's an air he's no different but let him become into a childhood let him come in to adoption let him come to the statue of a perfect man let him gather into all of these things and see it one more before we go go ahead with number three this one quote from brother branham on the seed shall not be air with the shuck he's talking about the seed hanging on you i like that see the spirit's speaking watch now it's true i said the seed shall not be air with a shuck that's a very strange text and like i said it looked like it'd be the other way you read it just read it the seed shall not be however to show it looks like it should be saying the shock shall not be aired with a seed huh no i ain't worried about that chuck's going its way i'm going my way the shuck won't be no part but the bride of jesus christ does not have to go through the tribulation but the seed of abraham the natural now listen the natural seed of abraham whether it be from isaac or israel the natural person unless he gets born again is going through the tribulation yes right or die before whatever you know right true because he has no place to go but the royal seat of abraham the bride of jesus christ that's a very strange text but the seed shall not be aired with a shock and from taking drawing my conclu conclusions on this of my text rather from galatians 4 27 3. paul here of course is speaking of the literal seat of abraham's two sons all right two sons you have to let god do the separating and that's why you don't want all of this two and three the two-ness and a one you want to be born again and be in the body of jesus christ come on musician and be ready to go against that day because we're at that day we're the seed of abraham by faith in jesus christ amen all right the bondwoman the shock shall never be free now listen just a second the shock shall never be free like the seed it's needed to be because the shuck cannot do that but the seed that comes from that point is the bride of jesus christ and it brings her to a perfection in jesus christ the seed shall not be our with a shuck chuck's going to the tribulation going into rapture two entirely different things two places two different ways let's stand together think on these things i don't want to be air with the shook i want to be of the free woman amen that's right i don't want to have to worry about whether i'm an israelite or a canaanite or any kind of ice or a lulla eye yeah i don't want to be none of that i want to be a born-again christian in the bride of jesus christ amen amen what about you let's think what we got what's in the chorus [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] you're a natural person believing in the works and good and all of it you're the one woman but if you're into free woman you're in jesus christ and all things are made possible [Music] oh thank you jesus [Music] adoption thank you you worry about my placing in [Music] you christ thank you jesus we're glad to have paul and freda back with us pray that they'll find a place and sit in and be part of us because that's all we are nothing to join nothing to do we're born into the kingdom what makes us the children of the free woman is by the new birth
