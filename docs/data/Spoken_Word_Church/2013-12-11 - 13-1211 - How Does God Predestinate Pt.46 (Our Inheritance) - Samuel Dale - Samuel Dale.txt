and we thank you and just forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us and let your love be made manifest in each one of our hearts and our lives in Jesus name amen Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let's go over to Mark the 10th chapter we'll begin reading in verse 17 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us th thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness to fraud not honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou likest go thy way and sell what thou Hast in give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you know what I this past Sunday we were trying to speak about and I want to try to carry the thought on through tonight if we can on but we were talking about how that he was the only begotten of the father all right the only one begotten brother R said that Adam was his created Son by creation but Jesus Was His only begotten son see coming by a woman amen all right and really it would take them the Virgin birth right to bring forth the only begotten that's why it says it's the only begotten that means there's not another one there's not there never will be another one there's never been another one other than he that was begotten right all right because it was begotten in that special way in that he was the Virgin born son of the Living God all right and see that was the point I was trying to get us to to think about uh MDC you can call him God because he was but remember he was spok into existence back out of existence he never had a birth he never had a beginning but the body had a beginning amen uh so then the body had to one day be made Eternal amen now watch that as we go along in the message a little bit tonight because I want to get into that point we realize and we believe that Jesus Christ was God made manifest in human flesh all right and we read there in John and spent a good bit of time talking about it that he was the only begotten of the father God in human flesh right all right now in doing that then by him see you and I can become Sons and Daughters of God okay all right so we we you know we we've been on predestination and this is a a point of getting down to it because the Lord willing will pick it up you know about the seed and start going through those things but getting it into our minds and our thinking about how that God does things he doesn't predestinate by desires he desired that everybody be saved but he predestines by forn knowledge all right see then that way he can predetermine anything by his forn knowledge and it's going to take place amen all right so you got a double point to be remember his for knowledge would be the fact that he would see it but then by him seeing it see then he would uh would speak it and that would be it he he saw Jesus Christ die before the foundation of the world in his mind right all right and he spoke it right all right so when he spoke it now all it had to do was wait till a time to come into reality right all right but it had to come into a reality to be that point see all right but now remember our point was that God never let man just go out of the garden he said I'll go with you right amen he came out he came down through the Old Testament we brought him through the Christ showing it coming down and brought him down then uh you know Sunday there to the only begotten as to being what what a body Hebrews 105 was prepared but the soul and the spirit was allmighty God himself that's right all right and see you can't kill God we know that because there's no way to kill that soul and that Spirit there's no way to kill your soul and spirit anybody can kill you whatever take your life but that doesn't kill your soul or your spirit it has to continue on somewhere else right all right so then there's no need of even trying to figure out well could he do no just take it what it says God was living in human flesh called a son all right now the reason he was called a son would be just what I said he was begotten amen he was brought into being a body thou Hast prepared me all right now and brought into be being there as as a human being a mortal fine that was that was fine cuz that's what it was all right but then by him giving up his life remember he didn't send a son didn't send somebody else he came himself by him giving up his life that was in him would be the only way you and I could be saved that's right amen it it's not the doctrines of the people of the message you know always was eternal but then you don't need Jesus so you you got your own little salvation and your own little going you don't need Jesus well what we need him for is to get us a revelation well you mean nobody wouldn't saved till you got a revelation I hope that went across until you got a revelation because that's their idea see all right but see now Rich Young Ruler he wanted to know what could he do he had heard this man you know and heard of him and maybe been in meetings and things because he he did know enough to know that this man was talking some way about eternal life amen so he he comes to him and he's he's wanting to know how can I have eternal life right he had kept all the laws he kept all the rules he kept all the regulations so then it wouldn't be as brother brandham said when somebody ask us today what must we do to be saved Did we tell them to quit this and quit that and stop this and don't don't do that that's rules and regulations now this man had kept all of them yes sir amen he kept all the rules the regulations the things to do or not do but he still recognized that he needed eternal life okay now now follow the point just for a second then we'll move on into the message but Jesus knew now follow me just for a minute and listen Jesus knew right then and there now are you with me right then and there him standing there he knew he could not just hand him eternal life right sure are you with me right amen if he could why didn't he right I mean you got a GU kept all the rules and regulations you lined up with the law a perfect guy as far as the world would be counted all right but see he knew that he could not give him at that moment eternal life that's right now watch about what he said to him see he knew that he had to die you know he knew Jesus knew he had to die to release that life that would be in him cuz he knew that eternal life was in him right right sure so he knew that the only way to release that was him dying yep okay are you following me them amen so notice what he said take up your cross and come and follow me now we put most of our emphasis on the fact that he was a rich guy and money got in his way and that's true that's where you didn't follow him but I'd like for you to think a little bit about this you think that what if he had what if he had a give all he had you and followed Jesus would that give him eternal life are you listening now would it have given him eternal life so then when Jesus said follow me he had something else in mind other than just back up your Duds walk with me we'll go down the highway one of these days I'll decide to give it to you he knew that he had to die he knew he had to die to release that life to where it could go back into that Rich Young Ruler that's right all right cuz there was no way to give it to him right there where he was at now where did Jesus really mean for him to follow him did he mean to just walk down the roads with him then would that have brought him eternal life if I was going to preach like these brothers the message you know she always was eternal I'd at least put a little bit of stipulation in it you know that they did follow him you know and do what he said and some didn't follow him and do what he said and you know but I want you to think about something where was Jesus actually wanting him to follow why was it that Judas yet he did follow him walked with him brother brand said he never made it to Pentecost that's right right so what was he talking about I just thought about these scriptures and I thought tonight I'd put a few scriptures in with with the thought you know I try to do that anyway but sometimes you're quoting scriptures and and people don't realize you are quoting if you'll listen to brother Bram that's what always amazed me I I'm I'm always had a decent memory decent and and I had a decent knowledge of the scriptures well I'd be listening to brother randam and you know I mean it's hard to listen to him sometime because he'll be talking and he'll quote about three scriptures right in a row I mean he he just quoting scriptures constantly amen you said well I never seen it that well just pull something he says and run it back over in the Bible and see if that's right he'd be quoting scriptures most of the time and then sometimes he'd say it like this he'd say now I've got a scripture in mind you ever noticed him saying it that way I've got a scripture in mind but see he's looking at something right well then when he preaches to there he doesn't always tell us that scripture right he expects us to know the scriptures all right now look at the scriptures what what we got a few things here is to be said for a moment of this you know what this Rich Young Ruler didn't do but yet what would have he had done if he had have followed Jesus literally right look at Matthew 19 I've just kind of put these in a little order I want you to just think about it Matthew 19: 28- 29 and Jesus said un to them verily verily I say unto you and ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit on his sit in his throne in heaven you also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that have forsaken houses or Brethren sisters father mother wife children lands for my sake shall receive a hundredfold and inher shall inherit everlasting life now that word Everlasting there is eternal right now he said follow me in the Regeneration amen so if the Rich Young Ruler had followed him all through his life from the time he contacted him would that have saved him no right right he had to follow him into regeneration now he didn't need regeneration right so he's not saying I'm going to go through it and you going to go through it right right right come on we got no sense to know that okay so what was he actually saying he said follow me in the regen generation he said in other words you get regenerated that's the way I want you to follow me right but it said now for you to walk with me is not it for you to take every step I take for you to do all these things you get beat you get whipped you get done no it was to follow him into regeneration now as I said we know for shity that he was not talking about that he would have to go through a regeneration but he knew what he was going to have to go through with to bring about our regeneration right so he was actually saying it follow me in the Regeneration go his part was he had to die to release that life right and then he says now if you'll do that you'll do these things you shall in HT eternal life all right speaking of the new birth which could not come at that time that he was talking why because John 7 says it 3 and 39 3 37 3839 John 7 what does it say see and in the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried say If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture sayth said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given why because that Jesus was not yet glorified so follow me in the Regeneration but I'm not going to have to go through a new birth I'm going to go through a death burial or resurrection and then I'm going to give my life life to you y right and that would follow into that regeneration right look at what Titus three and five has to say about it not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by what the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost amen all see then he knew that he would have to die to release that life that would be in him now you wonder why did I I keep emphasizing that in a minute then I hope it'll take away the carnality of our thoughts when we really get down to the point because our carnality of our thoughts can be locked in and and we not even realize that that we're not listening we are interpreting while we listen what somebody says I've said things and people come to me and say Brother D you said so I said I didn't say it yes you did I heard you I said okay we'll go get the tape cuz I don't mind it if I said it to say I'm sorry I shouldn't have said it that way but when I don't say something but I heard you say it well the rest of the building and the tape didn't and you see that's where we get our own little ideas and thoughts and and we interpret what somebody says or translated or whatever you want to say in our minds and not saying what the person has said Jesus never said that John was going to live until his return right how be it the Bible says they went a Doctrine out among them they said John wasn't going to die said Jesus didn't say that right he said how be it unto you if he does that's right in other words what your business is it all but see Jesus Christ knew before you and I could have a new birth eternal life that that life would have to be least out of him amen right right and I said now if you think you already got eternal life then this don't mean a thing to you and neither does the death of Jesus Christ right all right see then what did Jesus do we got right up to it our Sunday and I said I'd have to take it later because it didn't have enough time you know that Jesus Christ died to bring us to our inheritance amen all right now think about what I'm saying and then you'll understand why it's stated so much like it is look at number four which is adoption 1960 paragraph 75 look has predestinated us unto this inheritance all right if I a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart and saying William bradam I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life right well brother they always was eternal well now why does the rest of it go with it then now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to it to inherit it nothing I could do it was blank it was valid there's nothing I can do but in the fullness of time God sent in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance now he's just talking about your inheritance and eternal life he might go to your inheritance to be what what inheritance to sunship to be a Son of God right now to my inheritance of eternal life that's a great statement all right but now remember that before Jesus could give eternal life to the Rich Young Ruler it mean he had to die right so thereby the Rich Young Ruler didn't follow him right right in the Regeneration right but they did on the day of Pentecost some followed him all right so what happened look at the next one this is adoption U part 3 6 522 in the morning inheritance by predestination I in heard inited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance watch now beg your pardon that's right Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance now follow what I'm saying and then we'll just keep keep going with it Jesus never gave anybody eternal life yeah he had to die that's right sir so now you're following what he's saying Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance J Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance that's that's right brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the L book of life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first before anything right Jesus only come a lot here's the way that they try to make it say well there's a lot of people lost and and I'll go down and maybe they'll feel sorry for me and everything no he said I don't run my business like that and Jesus wouldn't run his right but get back up here to where we at Jesus never left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left us an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance that's right now how did he pay for your inheritance how did Jesus pay for your inheritance by giving his own life that's right amen true that's right right by giving his own life amen all right now so when he only come down to do what he brought you to your inheritance he never come to do but he come to bring you amen so look what he goes on to say next paragraph God by his for knowledge seeing exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved He sent Jesus to save those that he' already chosen now we're going to get to eternal life in a minute and see what it is didn't Paul say five verses behind that he chose us in him before there even was a world that's our inheritance what's our inheritance that we was chosen in him before the foundation of the world right God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the what his shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do all right now eternal life that's what everybody's concerned about how do we get eternal life okay the only way I know of receiving getting eternal life is for somebody to have to give it to you that's sensible that shouldn't need a great light bub to turn on it's just plain language but Jesus on this Earth even though he was the word made flesh right he could not at that time impart eternal life all right so now if we know he couldn't do it then nobody else couldn't do it true right but he knew that he was going to have to die to release that eternal life that's how Jesus never gave you an inheritance right if it have been he would have give it to us he paid the price yes right by dying right right and he said if you'll follow me in the Regeneration that's right all right then you'll have eternal life is that what we've just been through so then the only way to have eternal life is for Jesus Christ to have died all right and you know how I believe it the only way you and I can have eternal life is to die to ourselves and accept Jesus Christ as our savior amen amen all right but think about it think about what he done when he died think about as I said the other week there when he says you know this day this scripture is fulfilled think of all the other scriptures that he read he knew what he was going to have to do he knew when Isaiah said or uh was which one David said they pierc my hands and my feet he knew that they'd wag their head at him and he knew they'd beat him y to where he'd be unrecognizable he knew that right but yet he went through that where we could have eternal life amen right I know church I know sometimes I get arrogant and hateful about the way I say things about the preachers of this message but if you think so little of the eternal life that you have in you to let somebody pack down your throat the garbage cans of this message then you think nothing of eternal life I'm I'm as honest as I can be and I'm not mean and hateful I don't think I am but anybody with the truth ought to be just about ready to P the eyeballs out of these people and cut their tongues off you know they used to kill their own children in the Bible that prophesied wrong y do we need the Bible to to talk about that you know they used to kill them right y somebody prophesy Li what no problem just kill it we're not in that doings but you think about the eternal life that you you died to yourself to receive the life of Jesus Christ you turned against the world you went against what everybody else was going the world and the things and all like that and you gave your life to Jesus Christ and you've tried in your life to serve him when it could have been very easy could have been the things of the world and doing those things and even today been a religious person on your way to heaven and some preacher is going to preach you to heaven when you die you see what I'm trying trying my best to get one thing to you is to get you to think about what youve got and then you would let somebody brother around and said you go down here to a cafe and he said you you see a fly in your soup while you ready to sue the the cafe and the owners and the head owners and and everybody you wouldn't dare eat it you wouldn't take out to fly well he didn't eat to too much and eat resty your soup no I mean I'm honest I wouldn't even want another another uh replacement of soup right come i' figure it's coming out of the same Barrel that's right had a good life at the hos at the doctor's office yesterday you know you always talk about how old we are and how you have to buy you know these ointments of being gays and the stuff you know and buying a 5 gallon bucket I turned around and handed my wife is play in the Magazine and there it was selling these SES and things to rub on you in five gallon buckets I had I have to maybe I'll life that off and get out of the other parts of me okay now listen we talk about inheritance we talk about inherit and eternal life I want to ask you a question do you realize that Jesus coming the way he did and doing what he done would you believe that he inherited eternal life you're quiet ain't you what about him in her in eternal life you said wait a minute brother Dale you gone too far he was eternal life right agreed let's just let the prophet say it where we don't have to worry then okay go ahead number six which is paragraph 56 of Gabriel's instructions to Daniel 61 7:30 the morning service and we find that he was our kinsman redeemer and he took the book out of the hand of the original owner it was a title deed to Redemption we found that you remember the study it's a title deed of redemption it's an abstract deed with it and God required life or death in the Garden of Eden right that's right he required life for death in the garden when they died in the garden he had to take a life right an animal of his own so he required life back for their death are you listen to what he's saying then Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance that belong to him to his people if you done read that last next verse eternal life that he inherited by doing that oh no you better explain yourself all right he was eternal life he didn't get eternal life in his soul and his spirit that was eternal life but his body was not Eternal that's right by going through the fact that he would die to release that life that was in him by the death that he died Rel you know leaving the body then the body would be made eternal so the prophet's right right amen he inherited eternal life in flesh right amen come on are you with me sir that's right by dying himself by going through what he done to let that life that was within him the body be released then that body would become Eternal and it did in the resurrection amen sir now remember it's like the future home I believe it is or Christ somewhere in there I've got it in my memory that see Jesus's body was not Eternal it had to be made Eternal amen that's right see he inherited eternal life he the body inherited eternal life by going through what he went through right what about you and I are we willing to die ourselves to receive eternal life no always had it well you might as well click off out there if that's what you believe cuz because we certainly don't around here believe that that's right amen right but your Prophet is one that said it I didn't he said it's a title deed of redemption it's an abstract deed with it that God required life for death in the Garden of Eden he had to take a life because they died right all right then Jesus the righteous one died and watch what brother around say what Adam lost Jesus Christ restores right in Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance that belong to him now watch's that his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that now how did he inher eternal life he passed his own life back out at Calvary and divided it Among Us by the Holy Ghost amen no man has never been able to come to even think of the love that was that that was what he done he died that you and I could receive what was inside of him all right and by doing that he in he the body inherited eternal life that's right or was made Eternal right you remember the other day when we talking about we had the Eternal atonement see he released that life that could come back in you and I that's why there's just one true and living God it's not something that God sent another son or something or another person or this or that or the other he came himself amen and lived in human flesh that's right right is that the Bible in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily the body part was a creation right that had a beginning but by going through what he went through the body inherited it right right oh church if you can see what I'm talking about then if he knew that he was willing maybe that's what happened in the garden he knew he was going to have to die didn't he he prayed Lord but anyway let this pass I said Lord if this is the only way I can get eternal life to those other people that you've seen would want it then I'll go through with it amen right maybe his mind drifted back then to one day that he was standing there on Earth and he said father he said glorify me with the glory that I had with you before the world glorified right and what did God speak back I have both glorified thy name I'll glorify it again y I'm going to glorify you I'm going to give you eternal life you see we talk about an inheritance thinking about it some form of something that you and I we just get by being good people now I hope this will take that all out of there that when we get into predestination and the seed and the life and the carriers and the goings and that it will bring to our remembrance these things MH you see why I couldn't finish Sunday what I was doing I had to I mean we' have been 4 hours we' have been an afternoon cuz right now I'm I'm pushing to try to get through how long could you preach on it well brother Dale I never heard nobody say that Jesus had to inherit eternal life well see you you got your mind locked when I say Jesus I'm talking about the flesh right now when I say God I'm talking about I'll say Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ was almighty God Jesus Christ couldn't die that's right you can't kill that anointing that Christ that's right but Jesus the man was a product made for death to become a Kinsman Redeemer amen thank you Lord Boaz didn't have to die to give Naomi The Inheritance and then get Ruth right cuz you can give inheritances you can give your kids stuff and things you can you can give inheritance while you're alive and really it's the best thing in the world to do cuz they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff you whether you die and they have to pay all these taxes on in inheritance well figure out something but now listen he then received eternal life in Body by releasing the life that was in him you and I receive eternal life amen now follow the L of the quote if you would pull it back up brother Anderson by him releasing his life paying the price could bring us eternal life right all right the only way I could ever come well I was born with it well forget it according to my Bible and I Prophet you born in sin shav in iniquity spouse and mother's wound and you're a liar and if I say that I'm a liar so you calling me a liar Brother D yeah does it need to be said again but you see I'm trying to preach eternal life amen I ain't playing little kitty cat you know sugar tit doctrines and ideas come come on tell me you think I'm exalted tell me if youve ever heard anybody say that Jesus Christ inherited I mean Jesus inherited make sure I get it right have you ever heard anybody say that Jesus inherited eternal life oh I'm exalted so what is it the truth why can't we glory in the truth even the dumb donkey that's right can tell the truth that's right yes sir yeah no no that's Brother D don't believe that don't believe what you don't believe you're a prophet read it what did he do give the inheritance that belong to him to his people you realize that man the man the flesh had within him our inheritance if not where did it come from he had it in Him Sister G and he knew the only way we could get it was release it well then that's giving us no that's not giving us Eternal because remember he's inheriting the same as we're inheriting go think about it eternal life that he inherited by doing that he passed his own life back out at Calvary and divided it Among Us by the holy Holy Ghost the life that was in him came out and right back but it didn't finish in you and I right why because we only have the earnest of our inheritance right see if he hadn't to give his life there was no no way anybody else could be saved no way nobody else could get eternal life so he knew by releasing the life that it could come back in you and I and notice what it says inheritance that belong to him to his people now let's see if you can swallow see the only way you and I are going to get eternal life in flesh are you following me eternal the only way you and I are going to get eternal life in flesh is for him to come back inside of us first start giving us our inheritance right and I said that the way I wanted it giving us started it we're being born again that scripture see we only have the earnest of our inheritance cuz this is not he hasn't taken possession yet right now how are we going to get these bodies there's the key and give the inheritance that belong to him to his people eternal life belong to him the Bible says that the son of man have power to forgive sins and the Bible says the son of man ha power to give life right he's got the power that's right see he didn't die that that we might that would make us an inheritance are you following me see he never died to make us an inheritance that be him giving it to us he died to release what was in him that was our original inheritance our inheritance is eternal life through Jesus Christ we'll get to it in the scripture go ahead look at number seven got a few scriptures now to read and then we'll look what he says you're on adoption part 4 60 5522 in the evening paragraph 71 he said in whom we have obtained an inheritance in whom also we have obtained an inheritance oh an inheritance somebody has to leave you something to inherit it is that right an inheritance what inheritance do we have what inheritance did I have I didn't have any oh but always was eternal brother Dale you just don't understand well according to him but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the L book of life before the foundation of the world y That's Right inheritance has to do with a whe right you know I mean you you die you know and and you you've got to have a wheel CU if you don't stay can just take it they do a pretty good job anyway but I mean they can just take it if there's no will then you're at the mercy of the state right they can decide what to do with what and eat up a lot of it in whatever you call them you know right A Wheel so then where's my Wheel now we've been through it and remember now not a Scofield or yeah whatever but the Bible is the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne we've been through that all right and there is my will which is my Abstract title deed right amen and this whe in here tells me what belongs to Meen that's right right you make out a will you say in the will I leave we have three kids I leave my inheritance to divided we divided equally between my three children that's a will okay the state goes by that and they divided equally between the three right or I say well I'm going to give one so much and the other one so much and they have to abide by that and if I say well one of them's been a dirty rotten stinker and I'm not going to give them nothing but $1 now technically by the law if you've made a will you better state it that way you better state that i' be quit $1 to so and so then they can't protest to will but if you don't put that Dollar on there they can get you all right that's now a will the word of God is your will and your name was written in the book of life before the foundation of the world or it never will be written there right amen all right there as you will right here is the Bible amen are you with me this Bible is God's will to man this Bible tells me my inheritance cuz that's what a will tells you right right will tells you what you're inheriting this Bible tells me what I'm inheriting so there's my will there's my title deed of redemption there's everything I need you know your Prophet says this he said we are losing our inheritance every day yep he's not talking about eternal life you can't lose it right right we're losing our inheritance which is healing salvation Deliverance right right and we're losing it because we're not taking the book right the will and taking it before the court and say listen this is mine now you know the government's crooked all are crooked but we're not talking about crooked we're talking about what it's supposed to be if you got a will and it's authorized will stamped and got the seal on it everything done signed by Witnesses Etc you take it into the court it's supposed to be uh read right and abided by because it's completely authentic well this Bible is completely authentic that's but before the foundation of the world pull that back up let's look at it again number seven brother an inheritance somebody has to leave you something to inherit it is that right an inheritance what inheritance do we have what inheritance did I have I didn't have any but God left me inheritance when he put my name on the land book of life before the found found of the world oh you say but wait a minute brother Jesus did that when he died for you no he never roll it up where they make sure can see it brother Anderson you say now wait a minute brother Jesus did that when he died for me no he never Jesus come to purchase that inheritance for me said read the very next verse in whom we also have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will goes back to predestination amen predestination goes back to forn knowledge right my name was written in the L book of life before the foundation of the world it'll never be written there yours was too there's your will right or statement whatever you want to call a will to show you what you inherit and Jesus Christ died to bring that into being that we could have eternal life right let's read a few scriptures number eight 1 John 1:1 that which was from the beginning I like John you know John 1 and and and John first John 1 was written by the same guy and what's always amaz me they start off identical John said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt among look at what first John he said that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that eternal life made known by Jesus Christ it was the thing that was with the father is that John 1 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God you know the word was with God and the Word was God oh that's got to be two or three he's over here saying the same thing but he's talking about eternal life go the next one John 171 these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou H has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him and this is eternal life that we might Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom th have sent can I put it in this way this is eternal life to not by knowledge no God that's no more than a Rich Young Ruler walking with him but to know by Revelation who that God is is eternal life difference in a revelation and a natural right look at the next Romans 6 and 23 or the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life how who released it who brought it to you through Jesus Christ Our Lord right look at the next one 1 John 2:24 and 25 let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you shall continue in the son and in the father and this is a promise that he has promised us even eternal life if we can get to life that was in that one we call Jesus the Flesh and we have to do that by the new birth right amen then we can have eternal life look at the next 1 John 510 through1 13 uh first John 510 I we left off left off 10 I guess but it's talking about he that believeth on the Son of God ha to witness in himself and he that believeth not have not he's a liar all right watch verse 11 and this is the record that God had given to us eternal life record deed record right word Bible book Abstract title deed amen that's why it says over there in John about the record the record is that the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost is one right but the witness is water blood and spirit in your baptism they agree in one that's Bible if you want to go on over to the record watch and this is a record that God has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that has a son have life and he that hath not the Son of God have not life these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the son of God right written unto us that we may know that's it not by knowledge head but by revelation No 1 John 5:20 and we know that the Son of God has come and that's giv us an understanding watch it that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life not a head knowledge of knowing but a revelation that he's in your heart think on it John 10:27 and 28 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plug them out of my hand I give it to him he said look at the next one get a few scriptures Ephesians 1:13 just a few that have picked in whom all ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also I after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise watch which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession under the praise of his glory you realize an Earnest now or if you'll fall back with me just a little bit and think an Earnest is only a part payment but that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's in your soul the other thing got to come to Redemption before you can claim your full inheritance that's what I said folks this is the will this tells me this tells me here in second Corinthians 1:22 who ha also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts this tells me what get to the last one 17 1 Peter 1 three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you amen what days we going up there no Earnest starts here Earnest starts in the soul Earnest is a baby Faith we're not born again up here the disciples got to right here in their birth that's why it's the faith of the fathers we start here that's our new birth The Headstone completes our new birth the change of the body which is what we get into Romans the adoption to it the Redemption of our body we only have the earnest of our inheritance waiting for the full inheritance and brother R said that'll take place at the resurrection now that's where he covers it but are you with me did it sound kind of strange that someone would be so illiterate to even pronounce that Jesus Christ or Jesus the flesh would inherit eternal life but do you see what happened he did now here's my life statement he inherited eternal life in flesh right are you with me right he had eternal life in his soul Soul and Spirit was eternal because it was almighty God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself that body inherited eternal life and that body became my kinsman redeemer and you know what my kinsman redeemer can do he don't have to die again right Boaz never died to give Naomi and Ruth their inheritance Jesus Christ don't have to die again amen amen to give you and I eternal life in these bodies right that's right he's already made the way how by releasing the life that was in him that could come back into you and I and our soul and make our soul Eternal now we're in the Plan of Redemption and it being fully made manifest think on these things an inheritance of eternal life y now see if you'll follow on this second see then if you believe that that body had to inherit eternal life then you must believe that you and I would have to inherit eternal life not that we already have it yes but brother Dale you just don't make it a tantalizing I just get so excited when I hear and I get upset when I hear you preach praise God one day you will be happy and you'll tell me about it and we'll shout on the Hills of Glory but until then I don't worry about your little petty feelings and mind neither one that's right I'm trying to preach eternal life and I realize that a prophet said make it soft and they think you're trying to pull something over on them make it straight and at least you know where I stand I believe you must be born again to have eternal life in your soul and that eternal life coming in my soul then's going to make a way for this body to be redeemed you said well it was reded oh I just he you know it was redeemed back there brother it sure was but but it didn't take possession either right and just remember let me just show you how you fall into a hole you say he paid the price it was redeemed ain't took possession yet you agree well then I guess the ain't took possession of your soul did that go through if he ain't took possession of the body he might not have took possession of your soul yet remember the earnest comes in the soul first then we can talk about a bodily Redemption think on these things eternal ET life he wrote my name in the book The whe that I would and he knew that I would come to Earth because when Jesus stood as a lamb he had to come in Earth and and he knew when I came that one day I'd learn what this Bible was really about and I'd find my will written right here by his stripes I am healed right here don't have to look for another book just believe the one we got let's stand come on Brothers eternal life I'll make this life statement as they're coming eternal life is a person it's not a concept or a thought eternal life is a person it took a person to die not a concept or a thought it took a person and that person was almighty God to rip that Soul and Spirit out of that body that that body could become my kinsman redeemer to pay the price right and then like I said I don't know where you I hope you catch it then Boaz never had to die right because you can get an inheritance without your family having to pass away why can't we believe it now I have a right to preach Divine Healing I have a right to preach salvation why because my book says that I can what now brother Dale don't go too far okay we'll try not to but I thought that in Genesis where it says multiply and replenish the Earth that that was going to be a spiritual multiplication had it not got messed up and I thought that was what we were doing now that's right right and brother brandham said the bride can impart eternal life that's right am I right right that's what he said and wait a minute now you think no he didn't say we just got and speak what we wanted to he told us he said now if you want to impart eternal life he said the water is ready right out here how can I impart eternal life oh I'll just give it to you you you it's your you you just take it no no no just come on follow me follow me in the Regeneration follow me into the water follow me out of there and keep on going somewhere eternal life will come will walk in the Life go ahead brother dick get that to going somebody started come where the new drops of Mercy are shine all around us by day and by night
