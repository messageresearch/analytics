[9:30] amen can we get right into it I'm not in
[9:34] a hurry but I am going to have to leave
[9:37] after service so if I could get right
[9:40] into the next phase of this morning's
[9:45] message we will first John chapter 1 I'm
[9:50] just going to read verse 5 it says an
[9:53] awful lot in verse 5 tells us about the
[9:56] message of the hour that we believe
[9:58] whether you see it there or not and when
[10:01] you have it say Amen first John the
[10:05] Epistle of John chapter 1 verse 5 this
[10:07] then is the message which we have heard
[10:15] of him and declare unto you that God is
[10:19] light and in him is no darkness at all
[10:26] let's pray father Lord if we could just
[10:32] comprehend Lord those few words father
[10:36] we would understand the message we would
[10:39] be the hearers of it Lord and then the
[10:43] manifestation of it father so we're
[10:46] thankful for these few words that you've
[10:48] left for us Lord we ask father that you
[10:51] would bring them from the throne that's
[10:54] in our hearts Lord to the revelation of
[10:57] Jesus Christ father which we believe for
[11:00] your honor and your glory in Jesus
[11:02] Christ name we pray amen god bless you
[11:05] may be seated now brothers and sisters
[11:08] again I apologize for being so so cut up
[11:13] but I there's so much going on and I and
[11:15] I I'm no theologian I'm just a man who
[11:18] meditates on God's Word day and night
[11:21] and it begins to take an effect on me
[11:25] and then of course as time goes on you
[11:27] you know let me let me read something to
[11:30] you this just to help out a little bit
[11:32] now
[11:33] I've read this under many contexts but
[11:36] today's context will be just fine
[11:39] because of course there is this
[11:42] contention that that we can't do
[11:47] anything without brother Branham there's
[11:49] a contention of that now I do not
[11:51] believe that okay
[11:53] and I'm not impugning brother branham if
[11:55] you were to ask me personally from from
[11:58] a humanities standpoint about brother
[12:01] Branham himself who I never met I do
[12:03] have family members who after I got to
[12:05] know who brother Branham was I found out
[12:07] that my grandfather and grandmother had
[12:10] met brother Branham in Hot Springs
[12:11] Arkansas that if you were to say well
[12:15] who would you consider to be the top
[12:17] five men that walked the face of the
[12:19] earth well I'd have to put brother
[12:20] Branham and at least the top five if not
[12:23] the top three but he's not number one
[12:29] he can't be number one Jesus Christ is
[12:33] number one and he wouldn't want us to
[12:35] put him as number one but not to impugn
[12:39] that see but I want to shed some light
[12:43] okay God is light I want to shed some
[12:47] light on some things that were left to
[12:49] us from the Prophet
[12:52] I don't remember brothers if I give you
[12:54] this but I'm gonna because I it's I've
[12:57] got written down Church ages page 138
[12:59] and 9 I would have to say it would be
[13:02] the revelation of Jesus Christ big thick
[13:04] red volume series probably where I got
[13:06] this from because I can tell this is not
[13:08] polished up nothing wrong with the
[13:12] exposition now I'm not impugning that
[13:14] but listen to what he says it was not
[13:17] give to Martin Luther the light that's
[13:22] on the word today neither was it gift to
[13:26] John Wesley John Wesley preached
[13:29] sanctification that Luther passed over
[13:32] and the light comes as we have need of
[13:40] light God says it
[13:45] and it isn't opened up to us because
[13:49] it's hid to our eyes that's not the end
[13:52] of the sentence until the day that God's
[14:00] able to reveal it now this is the way
[14:03] God made me I read that I'm gonna keep
[14:05] reading but I read that I go wait a
[14:06] minute God can do anything
[14:10] how can it be stated that this is hid to
[14:13] our eyes until the day that God's able
[14:18] to reveal it he can do it anytime he
[14:21] wants but in his plan he set forth a
[14:26] pattern of the way that light was going
[14:29] to become can't come through its phase
[14:32] as if I could say brother Branham talked
[14:35] to us about it we know this that there
[14:37] is a spring sunshine there is a summer
[14:40] sunshine and there is a fall sunshine
[14:43] one brings forth the life out of the
[14:47] seed and the little sprig of grass and
[14:49] one becomes a very hot sunshine through
[14:53] the summer time which in many cases
[14:55] could kill that little sprig of grass
[14:58] but God made it so that it could
[15:00] withstand that sunlight of the summer
[15:03] and then we have the sunlight of fall of
[15:06] harvest right guess what it's all the
[15:13] same Sun it's not a different Sun
[15:15] there's not a bunch of different lights
[15:18] it's one light that God has ordained to
[15:22] shine in such a way you see he made it
[15:26] so that the Sun of the fall was able to
[15:29] bring forth the harvest not the Sun of
[15:31] the spring but it's the same Sun we're
[15:36] walking in the same light and I mean
[15:39] here's the things that come to me I'll
[15:41] just be myself in the evening time it's
[15:47] not a different light than came in the
[15:50] morning all right so he says it's hit to
[15:55] our eyes until the day that God's
[15:57] to reveal it wonder what it'll be after
[16:01] we leave that's brother branham saying
[16:08] this I wonder what it'll be after we
[16:11] leave yeah I am persuaded that there's
[16:15] very very much more that we know nothing
[16:19] about that's the words of the prophets I
[16:21] didn't make that up cuz brother Branham
[16:24] was sent here for a season and we
[16:28] understand that he tells us in the
[16:30] spoken word as the original seed that
[16:32] the message was - so is that right it
[16:38] was a sowing rain all right
[16:41] I believe God also used him for the
[16:45] harvest rain but it was before the Sun
[16:48] was able to reveal it it was born out of
[16:53] due season but then the season will come
[16:58] when those seeds that were planted by
[17:01] that sowing would come into position so
[17:06] that the Sun the light of God if you
[17:10] understand me would be able to bring
[17:13] forth that crop brothers and sisters we
[17:18] are that crop I don't know if you
[17:20] realize that or not but we are that crop
[17:22] it is the time the Sun has moved across
[17:27] the arc of the sky to come to the place
[17:31] where the seeds that were sown are now
[17:35] ready to be harvested there is a problem
[17:38] the Bible says the harvest is great and
[17:42] the laborers are few
[17:45] everybody wants to reap the benefits of
[17:49] the promises of the word of God but many
[17:52] many many people don't want to do
[17:54] anything about it here with me alright
[17:59] but we're gonna try to by God's grace
[18:02] bring a change to that if we could now
[18:05] again III do this for my own benefit so
[18:10] that I don't just
[18:10] get lost in the things that I'm
[18:12] preaching on because I have such a good
[18:14] time as you can tell but I'm gonna
[18:17] finish what I wrote down this morning
[18:19] now the devil would like to keep us
[18:21] thinking let me let me back up so let's
[18:23] take a look at our adversary we need to
[18:25] be able to discern who that is our
[18:28] adversary remember that the two spirits
[18:30] would be so close it's a spirit that
[18:33] reminds me remember when the big man was
[18:38] going to take brother branham off the
[18:39] platform in Portland Oregon I believe do
[18:43] you remember that we're policemen and
[18:45] they were gonna step out and try some
[18:48] brother Babb said to leave him alone
[18:49] this is not a flesh and blood affair I
[18:54] want to reinforce it this is not a flesh
[18:57] and blood affair and as long as people
[19:00] make it a flesh and blood affair they
[19:03] cannot produce the manifestation of the
[19:08] purpose of God there's one thing that
[19:12] the devil did in the beginning that kept
[19:15] a commandment or a mandate of God from
[19:18] taking place in our lives and it's
[19:22] affected us ever since okay bear with me
[19:27] it's not a flesh and blood now the devil
[19:30] would like to keep us thinking and
[19:32] believing that it is a flesh and blood
[19:35] affair but it's the very thing that this
[19:41] that Satan did that got Eve to take her
[19:47] eyes off of the promise of God and he
[19:52] tripped her up he caused her to doubt
[19:55] and once she reasoned that the serpent
[20:02] could be correct as he was speaking to
[20:06] her now how did how did the serpent
[20:09] approach her with a pitchfork with fork
[20:14] tools horns if the serpent approached
[20:18] Eve with the Word of God hath God not
[20:23] said
[20:24] you gotta watch that devil though
[20:26] there's that word not again God how come
[20:32] he just didn't say didn't God say but
[20:35] half God not said and when that was
[20:38] presented into the sentence it was a
[20:41] question think about it
[20:44] hath God not said it was the opening for
[20:49] reason now I'm telling you brothers and
[20:52] sisters this same tactic is used today
[20:54] he that the devil hasn't changed you
[21:00] know why he hasn't changed because he
[21:02] read in Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ
[21:04] is the same yesterday today and forever
[21:06] man he was not a creator he's only a
[21:09] pervert or of those things that he can
[21:11] get his hands on so he has to use God's
[21:16] Word in order to get anywhere but what
[21:20] he does is he misrepresents the placing
[21:24] of God's Word the positioning of God's
[21:27] Word especially to the believer you
[21:31] still bearing with me all right so she
[21:39] began to reason that the serpent could
[21:42] be want you to notice how I worded this
[21:44] could be correct then her eyes were
[21:49] opened and she saw that the tree was
[21:52] good for food
[21:55] now remember brothers and sisters I want
[21:57] you to remember something this is not
[21:59] flesh and blood it was not a literal
[22:04] tree growing fruit you all know that not
[22:09] to go into that
[22:10] okay it was something that represented
[22:14] something else we know that not here to
[22:18] preach on that but what I wanted to say
[22:20] was the deception of Satan is all for
[22:23] one purpose and that is to prevent
[22:27] something from happening well there's a
[22:31] lot of things going on but he's trying
[22:33] to prevent one thing from happening okay
[22:37] the commandment or the mandate from the
[22:40] Word of God that was given to manifest
[22:44] his children listen to how close this is
[22:51] how did the serpent trip up humanity
[22:54] through Eve by children how close it is
[23:04] he's so sharp that he looks into God's
[23:07] Word and he says ah I got it I figured
[23:13] out the promise of God and all's I got
[23:15] to do to be God has introduced my seed
[23:18] into the lineage of God and then I'll
[23:24] have children that God won't have and
[23:26] they'll worship me and not God whew
[23:29] that's close all the time you know I can
[23:36] use this word a he's a dummy but he
[23:41] didn't realize he was playing right into
[23:45] the hands of God's plan because God is
[23:49] the one who allowed the breach or the
[23:52] weakness to be available for the devil
[23:56] to use without God allowing it he
[24:03] couldn't do a thing but God allowed it
[24:07] so that he could express his attributes
[24:11] the reason that I preached on these
[24:13] things is so that we we need to
[24:15] understand brothers and sisters that
[24:17] it's coming back not just to the
[24:22] beginning but just before the beginning
[24:26] you see I contend that there was a line
[24:30] drawn an invisible line that Eve was
[24:34] behind who was that line I'm gonna tell
[24:40] you something it was the Word of God in
[24:44] the form of Adam
[24:47] she should have stayed behind her head
[24:51] she got out of her position she did not
[24:56] keep her post of duty she decided to
[25:01] step out from behind it therefore she
[25:03] had to cross an unseen line that left
[25:11] her vulnerable to the wiles of the enemy
[25:18] the message of the hour that you and I
[25:21] believe was given to us in this hour to
[25:24] a certain group of people who come to a
[25:28] revelation of being able to step back
[25:32] behind that line and fulfill God's Word
[25:37] in its totality without the Serpent's
[25:40] seat we will not accept the lie of the
[25:47] devil we will not accept reasoning as
[25:51] our way of viewing God's Word there's a
[25:58] line drawn right there and we're gonna
[26:02] step back behind it and it's gonna be as
[26:06] if the world never fell into the hands
[26:11] of the enemy you see that's the reason
[26:14] why Satan has done what he's done is
[26:17] because he's trying to keep you and I
[26:19] from becoming the fulfillment of Romans
[26:22] 8 the manifestation of the sons of God
[26:27] the whole world the Bible says is
[26:31] waiting groaning crying for that day of
[26:34] sweet release the whole world can you
[26:39] imagine
[26:40] what you hold in your hands can you
[26:42] imagine this afternoon what kind of
[26:46] authority God has given you but that
[26:50] authority that's been given you is just
[26:53] like he tested brother Branham as I
[26:55] mentioned this morning what will you do
[26:57] with them they're in your hands
[27:00] now I realize that because we're humans
[27:03] and we have psychological emotions and
[27:06] so forth many of us will stop when I say
[27:09] that and think well gee so do we let
[27:11] everybody off the hook you don't have to
[27:15] worry about who's on the hook and who's
[27:17] off of it
[27:19] holes were asked to do is become the
[27:22] fulfilment and the completion and the
[27:24] maturity of the promises of God and
[27:27] those for our hour now Martin Luther
[27:31] didn't have the light we've John Wesley
[27:33] too but in our hour it is the seed
[27:36] coming back to itself do you realize
[27:41] that let me read to something I know I
[27:44] gave this to you brothers it's a uniting
[27:47] the unveiling of God listen careful
[27:51] I forget the paragraph he Christ is the
[27:57] word how see Christ is the word and when
[28:05] we're in the word we're in Christ and
[28:08] how can I be in Christ denying Christ
[28:15] we're invited into him which is hid to
[28:21] unbelievers there's that knock on the
[28:23] door brother dick we're invited into him
[28:27] which is hid down believers by the veil
[28:32] of human flesh see they know that glory
[28:36] he's talking about who it's hit to they
[28:38] know that glory they read of it I'm
[28:45] sound stopping for a reason they read of
[28:47] it that's what we're all doing it's in
[28:52] the word hear of the glory of God and
[28:56] things like that it's just listen
[28:59] careful what does he say it's just a
[29:02] word to them
[29:07] see brothers sisters I'm not opposed to
[29:10] what we have in front of us in the form
[29:12] of literature don't get me wrong but
[29:15] over the period of years and time that
[29:18] people have been following this it's
[29:21] just become a word to them it's time to
[29:28] take this word that's been a word to us
[29:31] also and manifested he says to us it's a
[29:38] manifestation see it's no more a word
[29:42] it's a reality
[29:44] no that answers the question of why
[29:47] reality television is so popular serious
[29:52] because it's now time for God able to
[29:56] reveal this and Satan doesn't lay down
[29:59] he follows the floormat of God so we see
[30:04] television shows popping up they call
[30:06] them reality shows you know the
[30:09] Housewives of this and then the lost of
[30:12] that and then the pioneers of this and
[30:15] the gold rush of that and on and on and
[30:18] on and on and on and on what is it it's
[30:20] to draw away the real intention of God's
[30:26] word that is not a reality to me it's a
[30:30] falsehood think about it it's scripted
[30:35] how can somebody be lost on an island
[30:38] and naked with the camera crew following
[30:39] them
[30:40] [Laughter]
[30:43] that's right let me come on
[30:47] but did you know brothers and sisters
[30:49] that those shows are so popular because
[30:51] the people in the world today think oh
[30:53] wow what about us you see that's just a
[31:01] perversion of the reality of God God
[31:06] wants us not to become a reality
[31:09] television show God wants us to become
[31:12] the reality of his words whoa I just got
[31:19] a chill on that one to us it's a
[31:23] manifestation see it's no more a word
[31:25] it's a reality amen
[31:27] God said let there be light that was the
[31:31] word but now there is light it ain't the
[31:37] word it's light see what I mean now it
[31:42] isn't just a written word to us it's a
[31:47] reality
[31:48] brothers and sisters that's what carries
[31:50] the elect past everybody else I like to
[31:53] say it like this and forgive me if it
[31:55] it's it's it's not something I say to
[31:58] demean or belittle anybody but for the
[32:00] church salvation is the end result and
[32:05] doesn't that sound good
[32:07] come on but for the Bride of Christ it's
[32:11] just the first step
[32:14] salvation becomes the first stepping
[32:17] stone for the Bride of Christ to become
[32:19] the manifestation of salvation not just
[32:23] a word that you can feel good about
[32:27] think about it
[32:28] cuz you and I run into folks all the
[32:31] time that believe they're just as saved
[32:33] as we are and guess what they very well
[32:36] could be but when you begin to present
[32:39] the word to them in such a light that
[32:44] it's becomes the man that's why God used
[32:46] brother Branham all of the signs wonders
[32:49] and miracles of the Ministry of William
[32:51] Branham
[32:52] on purpose did you realize that brother
[32:56] Brennan called them the bait on the hook
[32:59] all of the signs wonders and miracles
[33:01] were emphatic unprecedented you
[33:06] understand what I'm saying vindicated
[33:11] how could anybody in their right mind
[33:14] that that really believed that brother
[33:17] Branham was the vessel God used and then
[33:22] say he's a false prophet how could
[33:26] anybody see the picture of the pillar of
[33:29] fire and I want you to understand I'm
[33:32] not raising up brother Branham I'm
[33:33] raising up the pillar and father
[33:35] it's the difference maker it's the same
[33:39] pillar fire that you and I desire to
[33:42] have living in our heart isn't that
[33:48] right that pillar of fires just like the
[33:51] fishes and the loaves on the day of
[33:53] Pentecost it broke itself off and it
[33:56] kept handing itself out and it never
[33:58] diminished as a matter of fact there was
[34:00] lots of leftovers and he put him in in a
[34:06] hiding place so they could be shared in
[34:09] the day we live in not just 2,000 years
[34:12] ago that same pillar of fire is here
[34:14] right now that same pillar of fire is
[34:17] what should be living in our hearts and
[34:19] it is the light of God God is light this
[34:25] is the message he said okay now you say
[34:31] well well brother there's eleven or
[34:33] twelve hundred different messages that
[34:34] we can and there's 66 books that's right
[34:37] but in order for any of us to be able to
[34:40] see with a spiritual eye what's in here
[34:44] it's going to take that light a
[34:47] flashlight won't do it as a matter of
[34:49] fact I I'm not gonna read it cuz I'm
[34:52] just I'm having a good time
[34:56] and I'm not in a hurry but yes we have a
[35:01] plane to catch now he might hold it on
[35:04] the ground hope you can tell I'm having
[35:10] a good time because I am but I have to
[35:14] put things down on paper or I'll be up
[35:16] here for days the Commandant or the
[35:19] mandate from the Word of God is given to
[35:22] manifest as the children sons and
[35:25] daughters of God these words spoken by
[35:29] God that would allow this to happen
[35:33] Genesis 1:28 I wrote down so let's let's
[35:37] go there I'm gonna I'm gonna do Genesis
[35:40] chapter 1 1 through 3 2 a Genesis 1
[35:44] verses 26 through 28 read like this
[35:47] everybody knows I'm in God wait a minute
[35:50] let let me be able to kind of help you
[35:53] see what I see and God saw that any what
[35:59] it says and God said now in your own
[36:05] Bible I want you to understand something
[36:07] that the very first thing that happened
[36:11] was not light oh right away that mental
[36:16] capacity wait a minute brother God said
[36:19] let there be light and there was light I
[36:21] can read that in Genesis 1:3 but you're
[36:24] overlooking something before there was
[36:26] light there was sound and God said that
[36:33] is the original seed the light that came
[36:37] into existence from God speaking became
[36:41] the manifestation of what he said and
[36:45] God said let there be light
[36:48] he didn't have to check over his
[36:50] shoulders I said this morning to kind of
[36:52] wonder if it was gonna happen but did
[36:55] you know the prophet of God taught us
[36:56] something he said that God had to have
[36:58] faith in his own word so much so that
[37:02] it's what brought it to pass
[37:05] cuz that's a law that he instituted for
[37:10] you and I if we take God at His Word it
[37:13] does not matter what these I see that's
[37:20] why Jesus when Nicodemus came and said
[37:22] born again come on how can I enter again
[37:25] you see where he's coming from how can I
[37:27] intellectually enter into my mother's
[37:29] womb and be born again
[37:30] and Jesus said well you think you hear
[37:34] the sound of the wind but you don't know
[37:39] where it came from and you have no idea
[37:43] where it's going but the children of God
[37:46] hear the sound and they're not looking
[37:51] with these eyes for the physical
[37:56] manifestation now but they're looking
[37:57] for the spiritual manifestation it is
[38:00] not a flesh and blood affair
[38:03] first Corinthians 15:50 I believe says
[38:06] flesh and blood cannot inherit so the
[38:12] inheritance that you and I are that the
[38:14] devil's fighting us over in this
[38:16] conflict is not flesh and blood it's
[38:20] something much greater than that it's a
[38:23] promise of God did you realize that we
[38:28] are in a conflict over the promises of
[38:31] God not over what we see taste feel
[38:36] smeller here but I'll tell you what see
[38:39] taste feel smell and here is a result of
[38:43] God said and God said let there be light
[38:51] so in the scripture it even tells us
[38:57] that the first thing that happened when
[39:02] God decided to begin this of course it
[39:05] says and God created the heavens and the
[39:06] earth period is that right we don't know
[39:10] how long that took but when he began to
[39:12] want to implement his plan and God said
[39:19] let there be light is that right
[39:22] listen to what the Prophet says here if
[39:25] I can find it real quick in God's Word
[39:27] calls for a total separation of unbelief
[39:31] God was going to use the earth I didn't
[39:38] know it for the first 21 and a half
[39:39] years but God was going to use the earth
[39:43] listen now and it was in total darkness
[39:47] brothers and sisters that was my life it
[39:50] was in total darkness but because God
[39:55] was going to use listen now he was going
[40:00] to use the earth and it was in total
[40:02] darkness the Spirit of God spoke out and
[40:07] said let there be light listen now and
[40:12] he separated the light from the darkness
[40:15] all this is the reason I read this whole
[40:17] thing and it's been doing that ever
[40:20] since
[40:22] God's word has been using light which is
[40:27] the manifestation of his word to
[40:29] separate it from the darkness that's the
[40:34] reason why the denominational men and
[40:36] the men of high intellect and the PhDs
[40:38] and the ll DS and the and the so forth
[40:40] and their so Long's look at your brother
[40:41] branham and said dr. davis said you
[40:43] you're gonna pray for kings and
[40:45] potentates and come on get next year
[40:49] south billy it's the same thing the
[40:53] devil's telling us right now he's not
[40:58] gonna use yeah he's gonna use the
[41:00] prophet see where that comes from
[41:03] see where that comes from oh we're gonna
[41:05] wait for the prophet to come back well
[41:07] I'll tell you what the Prophet said when
[41:09] they say I'm dead and gone don't you
[41:11] believe it that's his word because this
[41:16] message is not about just one man unless
[41:20] it's Christ Jesus it's about the body of
[41:22] Christ which william branham is a part
[41:24] of I understand that he was a very
[41:28] critical part of it
[41:30] I'm in your body we're all sitting here
[41:32] you let me take your brain out
[41:35] you're still a body but you ain't doing
[41:39] much you understand I want you to see
[41:44] that see because the devil is trying to
[41:48] accomplish something by keeping you and
[41:51] me listen brothers and sisters he didn't
[41:54] keep brother branham from doing his part
[41:55] did he he didn't keep Jesus Christ from
[41:59] doing this his part he thought deep
[42:01] thought crucify Jesus because he was in
[42:09] the mind of God before that he was the
[42:11] mind of God before the foundation and he
[42:13] didn't why pass this theophany he
[42:17] understood you know what this is gonna
[42:19] be really cruel and really hard and it's
[42:21] gonna hurt a lot it's gonna be the most
[42:24] ugliest worst thing that could happen to
[42:27] a human being but not my will I'd be
[42:32] done and he walked to Calvary and he
[42:35] hung on that cross knowing that he did
[42:39] his part how do we know that because he
[42:43] bowed his head and he said it is
[42:46] finished he did his part but he did it
[42:51] for one reason it tells us in saint john
[42:54] 12 that a corn of wheat abideth alone
[42:57] that's it fall into the ground and die
[43:01] if it fall into the ground and die then
[43:05] it'll bring forth much fruit now here's
[43:10] the key to fruit it's not just the
[43:13] succulent sweet juicy flavorful call for
[43:17] part of it that matters it's carrying
[43:21] the next seed it's carrying the next
[43:28] seed and what is the seed that you and I
[43:32] realize is essential what let me let me
[43:36] ask you this what is the original seed
[43:39] the spoken word that's why I'm
[43:43] emphasizing
[43:43] and God said let there be like so it
[43:50] wasn't the light that we should be
[43:52] focusing on it was what he said because
[43:56] that's the original seed now what else
[43:59] does the Bible say and I'm cutting out a
[44:00] lot of my message it says every seed you
[44:06] see in Genesis 1:26 7 and 8 which I was
[44:09] going to read but for the sake of time
[44:10] you know it you can read it verse 28
[44:13] says be fruitful and multiply and right
[44:19] there
[44:21] Satan knew if I could get into the
[44:23] serpent and I could get Eve out from
[44:26] behind her post of duty which was to
[44:28] stand behind the word which was Adam at
[44:31] the time a son of God brother Branham
[44:33] tells us in the spoken word is the
[44:34] original seed that Adam hadn't come to
[44:37] the revelation of the realization or the
[44:40] knowledge yet of how he was going to
[44:42] fulfill Genesis 1:28 but it was in him
[44:46] he just hadn't come to how it was gonna
[44:49] happen that's in spoken word is the
[44:51] original seed if you want to listen and
[44:53] read it six hours long so it'll take you
[44:54] some time but it's good it's good for
[44:58] you
[44:58] the spoken word is the original see is
[45:01] that right I mean we all know that I
[45:03] just asked so that you can confirm to
[45:05] yourself let me tell you folks something
[45:07] God's foreknowledge knew that Abraham
[45:11] was going to take Isaac up on top of the
[45:14] mountain God's foreknowledge knew that
[45:16] Abraham was gonna plunge the knife so
[45:21] then all of that was not for God it was
[45:26] so Abraham would realize but I'm gonna
[45:29] do this no matter what
[45:31] stop right there Abraham I knew you were
[45:33] gonna do it but I wanted you to know you
[45:36] were going to do it when God was looking
[45:38] for Adam in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam
[45:41] this is this is the omniscient
[45:42] omnipotent God he wasn't looking at him
[45:47] were yet I'm gonna tell you what he was
[45:50] asking at him Adam do you know where
[45:52] you're at
[45:53] you know yeah we got that in the 60s
[45:56] didn't win the 70s what are you at man
[45:58] where are you coming from you know it
[46:02] didn't mean that address it meant like
[46:05] what's going on what's going on inside
[46:07] of you oh and when Adam heard that he
[46:11] said huh I gotta hide from the Lord the
[46:15] Lord knew where he was at but he wanted
[46:18] Adam to respond you see
[46:20] God understood his own word he
[46:23] understood that what happened there in
[46:25] the garden was a hybridization of his
[46:29] word
[46:30] I'm telling you brothers and sisters
[46:33] Satan knows what he's doing he's sharp
[46:36] but greater is He that is in us in me
[46:40] than he that is in the world is that
[46:42] right I believe that believe that with
[46:44] all my heart so watch how sharp the
[46:48] devil is now you may not think I'm
[46:50] preaching straight up but the spoken
[46:53] word is the original seed I believe that
[46:56] with all my heart an order for the
[46:57] spoken word to fulfill
[46:59] Genesis 1:28 replenish and multiply what
[47:03] do you have to have I've spoken word you
[47:07] see and that hadn't been given that
[47:09] revelation hadn't been given to Adam
[47:11] even though it was in him in a seed form
[47:14] it was in there but it hadn't come forth
[47:16] yet how should I explain that to you has
[47:19] anybody ever read in here that Jesus
[47:21] Christ God manifest in the flesh as the
[47:24] son of God Saint John 1:14 did not know
[47:28] the seventh seal that's what the
[47:33] prophets said and I never questioned
[47:35] that I would just say Lord that's you
[47:40] that's you in a body of flesh how do you
[47:45] not know your own seventh seal and he
[47:54] said son you have to understand that the
[47:56] body that I was using that you called
[47:58] Jesus was a man but he was born a virgin
[48:06] birth
[48:07] see what I'm saying God's egg God's seed
[48:11] planted in the womb of a church that we
[48:16] call malli okay no sensation brother
[48:21] bharata said i could see it no sensation
[48:24] why because brothers and sisters when
[48:25] you give your heart to the lord you
[48:28] don't know it but god's putting a seed
[48:30] and an egg in there what just happened
[48:35] and you find yourself wandering around
[48:37] saying be it unto me according to thy
[48:40] word be it unto me according to white
[48:42] that's God beginning to plant what eve
[48:49] refused to accept through reason what
[48:53] she did was she took a seat you see how
[48:55] sharp the devil is he began to preach to
[48:58] her like this brother listen here gal
[49:02] you all have a problem you and Adam are
[49:08] not manifesting God's Word you see how
[49:13] he slick he is dead don't tell me he's
[49:15] not telling you and me that you are not
[49:18] manifesting God's Word that you can read
[49:20] about that's for the aging women you're
[49:23] not manifesting and what's the matter
[49:25] with you I got a plan he says I want you
[49:30] to look at my crop remember the serpent
[49:32] was a beast he was of the animal kingdom
[49:34] in the previous to Genesis 1:28 they
[49:36] were already in replenishing and
[49:38] multiplying so he knew what he was doing
[49:39] he had a knowledge of the principles of
[49:42] life were top right so he knew what he
[49:44] was he says hey gal tell you what I've
[49:47] been producing the manifestation of the
[49:50] promises of God all along and look at
[49:53] you you're barren what's the matter with
[49:57] that husband of yours
[49:58] that's a devil's tactic
[50:01] what's the matter what that word you
[50:03] believe nothing but we're putting it all
[50:06] back on God God's wanting us to take it
[50:10] in the form that he gave it to replenish
[50:13] and multiply which is the spoken word
[50:17] it's the very
[50:18] and why we believe the message because
[50:21] it's the quart of wheat but guess what
[50:26] the corn of wheat abideth alone that's
[50:30] why a lot of people see the
[50:33] denomination's see Christ by himself and
[50:38] the message followers see william
[50:40] branham all by himself oh no a corn of
[50:45] wheat abideth alone it'll stay just like
[50:50] that unless it dies falls into your
[50:54] heart when that seed goes into your
[50:57] heart and dies it no longer abides alone
[51:00] it has become the fulfillment of
[51:03] replenish and multiply here's the reason
[51:07] why the devil is trying to keep the
[51:09] fivefold ministry from manifesting
[51:12] itself because it is the mouthpiece that
[51:17] God uses now not a not any of us men can
[51:20] Satan I'm a fivefold Minister Salam
[51:21] let's just write my name in there God
[51:23] hath placed some so that was God's doing
[51:27] not man's doing but when God places
[51:30] something I'm gonna tell you what
[51:33] there's a price to pay if you get off
[51:34] track brother Branham paid with his
[51:37] first wife and his first daughter
[51:39] brother Branham nearly paid with his
[51:41] life when he went to South Africa and
[51:43] began to listen to those men who were
[51:46] using the same reasoning at the serpent
[51:50] used on Eve oh come on
[51:52] God talks to us to remember that that's
[51:56] exactly what those men told brother
[51:58] Bentham God talks to us to who do you
[52:00] think you are
[52:00] brother Badham straighter said well you
[52:02] Nathan in court and he should have got
[52:05] his thumb I'll excuse me and started
[52:07] hitchhiking back to Johannesburg but he
[52:10] didn't he let those men talk him in to
[52:13] going to the next destination and he
[52:16] nearly gave his life he had some kind of
[52:18] an amoeba bug that easier from the
[52:21] inside out remember he's he's a really
[52:26] good modern-day example for you and me
[52:31] you're not I'm not we're not getting
[52:34] away with nothing nothing if there's a
[52:38] price to pay
[52:39] brothers and sisters weren't paying it
[52:41] but guess what happens with the
[52:44] attributes of God willingly not my will
[52:48] Lord but thine be done
[52:51] if that's what it takes I'll do it why
[52:57] because there's something down on the
[52:59] inside of us in the form of a seed of
[53:02] God that says I can lay this body down
[53:10] I'm quoting your brother branham now he
[53:13] says this is in us I can lay this body
[53:16] down and he'll raise up again now notice
[53:21] how I said that I didn't say I would
[53:22] raise it up again I can lay this body
[53:24] down and at the same spirit be in you
[53:28] that was in Christ he will raise you
[53:31] from the dead is that right so the
[53:35] spoken word being the original seed and
[53:38] Satan getting in there and beginning to
[53:41] interfere with the process of God I
[53:48] think brother branham's wife called a
[53:50] hickey not the black mark on your neck
[53:55] I used to bend rebar hey here you go and
[54:02] that little machine that you put the bar
[54:05] in and you pull the handle and you get
[54:07] the angle on the bars called it a key we
[54:09] used to laugh when I was a little kid my
[54:11] dad said go get the Hickey saw been some
[54:12] rebar but I didn't know where that came
[54:18] from
[54:19] a little hickey in the promise of God is
[54:29] what caused all this to happen and I'm
[54:31] reason I'm preaching on it brothers and
[54:33] sisters is not because we don't know
[54:34] that it's because somebody's gonna have
[54:36] to take the thing and bend it back to
[54:41] its original position in God's Word
[54:44] then that becomes the original seed that
[54:48] can produce after its kind that's the
[54:52] reason why Satan's trying to keep the
[54:53] fivefold ministry under wraps because
[54:56] they are the ones that God gave the
[54:59] authority to not them you got to realize
[55:02] the men don't look at themselves that
[55:04] way they're just the vessel of tool
[55:06] being used to speak what are they
[55:08] speaking the original seat we're using
[55:11] the message and the Bible as our basis
[55:14] for our speech and God said we're all
[55:20] looking for the light that's the
[55:22] manifestation of what he said it's not
[55:26] an actual light it's a super it's a
[55:30] light that can only be produced by
[55:34] staying with the word that's the only
[55:38] way that God is going to vindicate you
[55:41] and I remember what the Prophet
[55:43] challenged everybody with listen now
[55:44] fellas ladies and gentlemen he said
[55:48] would God vindicate a ministry that was
[55:50] false
[55:51] he said far be it from God that's why I
[55:54] can challenge you he said that anything
[55:56] I told you that's the said the Lord has
[55:58] anybody ever seen it miss has anybody
[56:01] ever seen it fail has it ever gone wrong
[56:02] no nobody ever challenged brother
[56:05] Branham the 300 ministers in Chicago
[56:07] thought they were gonna and then brother
[56:09] Braniff said they had more sense than I
[56:10] thought they had because he called him
[56:12] up there bring your Bibles up here in US
[56:13] but he said in another place that they
[56:16] knew that the angel of the Lord was
[56:18] standing right there they weren't
[56:20] willing to go up against the angel of
[56:21] the Lord they were willing to go up
[56:23] against William Maher and Branham a man
[56:25] with an eighth grade education that
[56:26] didn't paint fetch tote pulpit remember
[56:32] what they picked on him for how could
[56:34] you brothers and sisters can I ask you
[56:37] personally isn't that the same question
[56:39] the devil is posing to you and I come on
[56:42] come on your life is a mass and this and
[56:45] that and then if you believe God's Word
[56:48] and every word of God it doesn't make a
[56:52] lick of difference what the devil does
[56:54] with your natural life
[56:57] you see it's not flesh and blood but
[57:00] that's not carte blanche for us to make
[57:02] grace into disgrace
[57:03] that's not carte blanche for us to
[57:06] become legalists or fundamentalists
[57:07] either what it is is it's the grace of
[57:10] God that comes into your life and you
[57:12] won't look to the right or to the left
[57:14] you'll just keep following the pattern
[57:17] of God until you become the
[57:20] manifestation of a son or a daughter of
[57:26] God because eventually the serpent
[57:30] talked Eve into partaking of another
[57:36] line to be injected and that caused a
[57:40] chasm in between Adam and Eve and the
[57:44] promise of God that they were to fulfill
[57:47] brothers and sisters I'm gonna finish
[57:50] with this here we are this afternoon God
[57:53] has given you an i the spoken word that
[57:59] is the original seed that seed must
[58:05] bring forth after its kind are you with
[58:10] me now I'll finish it with this how is
[58:13] that so brother Chris what are you
[58:15] talking about I'm talking about if you
[58:19] say if you say that's the end result for
[58:28] the believer today if you say to this
[58:32] mountain if you say it'll happen and
[58:37] brother branham was given to you and I
[58:39] as an example what are you doing brother
[58:42] banner what are you doing out here in
[58:44] the woods my son well I'm squirrel honey
[58:47] hadn't seen one all day what do you need
[58:52] he's scratching his head see he's he
[58:54] hasn't caught on yet
[58:55] yeah no what are you doing I mean he
[58:57] kept reading what are you doing I'm
[58:59] squirrel hunting what do you need a
[59:01] couple of times he caught it oh I need
[59:05] squirrels
[59:06] well then say it did you realize that
[59:12] all's that was to you and I was a
[59:15] preview
[59:17] did you realize brothers and sisters
[59:19] that the same God that used the profit
[59:25] that brings squirrels into existence
[59:26] stop the storm speak the goner out of
[59:29] his wife give Hattie mine whatever she
[59:33] wanted it's the same God now when are we
[59:41] gonna stop letting Satan an angel of
[59:46] light that's what it says in Corinthians
[59:50] and his ministry comes across the same
[59:53] way it says that his ministers and
[59:55] hustle mites when are we gonna stop
[59:59] paying attention to the light and begin
[1:00:03] to speak and God said I'm gonna say I'm
[1:00:09] gonna stop with this I've had four or
[1:00:11] five dreams in my 41 years of serving
[1:00:14] the Lord with brother Branham in them
[1:00:17] that doesn't mean I'm spiritual that
[1:00:20] doesn't even mean they have any validity
[1:00:23] but I'll tell you what I did have makes
[1:00:27] perfect sense to me today in this dream
[1:00:30] I come out of the forest and I'm looking
[1:00:33] at an open grassy field for those of age
[1:00:39] I'll mention Woodstock with a big
[1:00:43] platform built at the end of this field
[1:00:47] okay and and there was chairs set up
[1:00:52] thousands of chairs folding chair set up
[1:00:55] nice rows big platform with the back and
[1:00:58] a little top to it and a microphone
[1:01:00] stand and I'm thinking wow this is gonna
[1:01:03] be some meeting and I'm way in the back
[1:01:08] and there must be a hundred rows of
[1:01:10] chairs and way up in the front nobody's
[1:01:14] there yet I see
[1:01:15] three men standing at the front row of
[1:01:19] the chairs and one of those men kind of
[1:01:23] angle towards me when I'm looking has
[1:01:25] his leg up like this and he's leaning on
[1:01:27] it like this and he's talking to these
[1:01:29] two other men so I'm coming up from this
[1:01:32] part of this dream and as I get closer I
[1:01:36] realized that's brother Branham and he's
[1:01:39] talking to those two men I don't know
[1:01:42] who those two men were but he was doing
[1:01:44] just like this and as I started to walk
[1:01:46] up he must have heard me or since me and
[1:01:48] he looked and he just nodded his head
[1:01:50] and he kept talking so I just stopped
[1:01:53] right there and I heard him say this to
[1:01:55] these two men brothers I must decrease
[1:02:02] I'll tell you why brothers because the
[1:02:06] ministry that God has given me this is
[1:02:08] brother Branham talking not me the
[1:02:09] ministry that God has given me has
[1:02:11] produced too much light and it's
[1:02:16] blinding the eyes of many of the people
[1:02:20] that are following me so I must decrease
[1:02:25] it made perfect sense to me brother day
[1:02:28] because we've begun you know youyou they
[1:02:31] think he's Jesus Christ there's still
[1:02:33] the same you remember the little serpent
[1:02:35] and the message the bruised serpent
[1:02:37] brother Branham was gonna kill that
[1:02:39] serpent was named and he was interrupted
[1:02:42] by a minister who said here brother
[1:02:45] Branham do it this way remember go back
[1:02:50] and read it and when he turned that
[1:02:54] serpent crawled into a little puddle of
[1:02:57] what is water people's so while I
[1:03:02] believe that serpent was mortally
[1:03:05] wounded
[1:03:06] that's the term brother Branham used it
[1:03:09] wasn't fatal yet did you know there's a
[1:03:12] difference mortally wounded means it's a
[1:03:15] wound unto death but it could be like
[1:03:18] the guy that went to the pool of siloam
[1:03:22] it might be 37 years or 50 or 60 years
[1:03:26] before it finally takes you
[1:03:27] um fatally would be different dead did
[1:03:33] you know that that little bitty snake
[1:03:34] has raised its ugly head up again but
[1:03:40] but I say it like this brother branham
[1:03:42] said you can shoot over the target you
[1:03:44] can shoot under it you can shoot to the
[1:03:46] right or you can shoot to the left or
[1:03:47] you can hit the bull's eye and the and
[1:03:50] the and the gun factory said that gun
[1:03:53] wasn't made to shoot that little group
[1:03:56] don't you remember brother branham and
[1:03:58] his rifle he got so frustrated oh right
[1:04:01] I've shot the eyes out of squirrels at
[1:04:03] 50 yards now it won't group within 10
[1:04:06] inches the factory tells him come on
[1:04:08] that gun wasn't made do you remember
[1:04:12] that gun wasn't made to shoot that tight
[1:04:14] of a group and brother BAM said I own
[1:04:16] the gun I've shot eyes out of squirrels
[1:04:19] I know this gun can hit the target every
[1:04:23] time but you know what people are doing
[1:04:27] today brothers and sisters they got the
[1:04:31] same gun they're moving the target to
[1:04:35] wherever the bullet will go they're not
[1:04:38] hitting the bullseye that's what's God
[1:04:42] has called you and me to do to stand on
[1:04:45] his word in such a way where when that
[1:04:48] gun goes off remember there's a lot of
[1:04:52] shells that didn't fire put it in the
[1:04:54] gun clip put it in the gun plate put it
[1:04:58] in the gun never forget to aim because
[1:05:01] one day that gun is going to go off and
[1:05:03] you want it to be pointing at the bull's
[1:05:06] eye please stand
[1:05:13] God is so good as you're standing I'm
[1:05:19] going to read this to you it's just a
[1:05:20] paragraph out of exists the sign of the
[1:05:22] inn sirs don't worry brothers paragraph
[1:05:25] 204 I want you to listen to what brother
[1:05:27] Bram says first a blast now you might
[1:05:31] not think this is significant but I want
[1:05:33] you to pay clear first a blast hmm and
[1:05:35] God said that was a sound right first a
[1:05:40] blast and I thought it sounded like a
[1:05:43] sound barrier every what you call it
[1:05:45] when planes cross the sound and the
[1:05:48] sound comes back to the earth it just
[1:05:54] shocked like roared everything then it
[1:05:56] could have been a great great or a a a
[1:06:01] great clap of thunder and lightning like
[1:06:04] listen to what brother BAM says I didn't
[1:06:06] see the lightning I'm just reading what
[1:06:10] he said I didn't see the lightning I
[1:06:12] just heard that great blast that went
[1:06:17] forth that's right brother Nick brothers
[1:06:19] and sisters we've got to stop using our
[1:06:21] natural eyes to look for the
[1:06:23] manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:06:25] we've got to begin to realize that it's
[1:06:27] God said and I'm not taken away from any
[1:06:30] kind of movement with shouting and
[1:06:32] dancing and and then falling out in the
[1:06:34] spirit and praying for the sick and
[1:06:36] having prayer I'm not taken away from
[1:06:38] that Paul said let's go on to perfection
[1:06:41] in Hebrews 6 this what we do if God
[1:06:43] permit when God permits it we do it but
[1:06:47] let's go on to perfection

[1:06:54] kind and that is the spoken word you
