[3:49] 25
[3:50] exodus chapter 25

[3:57] was trying to get away from the topic of
[3:59] the tabernacle but i couldn't
[4:02] i know brother wade's been on it as well
[4:04] and uh it seems like the lord just maybe
[4:07] wants to say something to us
[4:09] let's find out what he wants to say amen
[4:12] praise the lord jesus um
[4:14] and so let's just uh
[4:17] let's just go to the lord in prayer
[4:19] lord jesus we thank you once again for
[4:21] the opportunity to open back the pages
[4:23] of your word lord to
[4:24] to bring us here father god with
[4:28] expectation in our hearts lord knowing
[4:30] that you are the speaker in this hour
[4:33] lord
[4:34] father god the bride father doesn't have
[4:36] her own voice lord she has your voice
[4:38] lord
[4:39] father god she only says what you say
[4:41] lord jesus she only does what you do
[4:43] lord god and she only thinks what you
[4:46] think father we ask lord jesus that this
[4:48] morning father god let us receive your
[4:50] thoughts father and not father god let
[4:53] us lay aside all the thoughts
[4:55] all of our own thoughts aside and all of
[4:57] the weights and the sins that would so
[5:00] easily beset us lord jesus and let us
[5:02] father god just run this race with
[5:04] patience forgive us father this morning
[5:07] for our sins lord for father god we fail
[5:09] you in many ways lord
[5:12] and many many ways lord we don't deserve
[5:15] nothing father god that comes from you
[5:17] but lord jesus you told us father god to
[5:20] approach you with boldness lord that
[5:22] means father god that is ours
[5:25] and you want us to take it lord jesus
[5:28] and we ask you heavenly father to help
[5:29] us this morning to take
[5:31] what rightfully belongs to us what you
[5:33] purchased for us lord on the cross of
[5:36] calvary lord we love you we commit this
[5:38] time into your hands bless us through
[5:40] your word we pray in jesus christ's name
[5:43] amen amen
[5:45] before we read i just want to say also
[5:48] that i appreciate that appreciate that
[5:49] sunday school lesson brother brother
[5:52] brother john we certainly enjoyed that
[5:54] and uh
[5:57] you know you might not you may not think
[5:58] well what if finance has got to do with
[6:00] my spiritual life it's got to do a lot
[6:03] because because remember the stature of
[6:05] a perfect man is for this outside body
[6:08] right and if we can't if we can't handle
[6:11] if we don't know how to handle money if
[6:12] we don't know how to handle one another
[6:15] if we don't know how to stop lying if we
[6:17] don't know how to how to do those little
[6:19] things stop cheating stop every now and
[6:21] then you know throwing something that's
[6:22] not true you know even if as a joke and
[6:25] things like that
[6:27] then
[6:28] it's got to be the holy ghost working
[6:30] from the inside out right
[6:32] and and so we we we we can think we can
[6:35] think oh
[6:36] all i need is the deep truths of the
[6:38] word and you do need that don't get me
[6:41] wrong but the deep truth of the word
[6:43] will lead you to live a life
[6:45] before others
[6:47] right all right so so so it's very
[6:50] important and i i believe i believe the
[6:52] way you handle your finances god has a
[6:54] way in the bible for you to do that amen
[6:57] so that's what the brother was trying to
[6:59] do
[7:00] and so there's you want the answers to
[7:02] your life they're all in the bible
[7:05] they're all in there every even even
[7:08] even it touches your checkbook
[7:12] it does
[7:13] because because that's how god set it
[7:15] forth amen
[7:17] praise the lord jesus well let's read
[7:18] exodus chapter 25
[7:20] and let's start at verse 10. it says and
[7:22] they shall make an ark of him wood
[7:25] two cubits and a half shall be the
[7:27] length thereof
[7:28] and a cubit and a half the breadth
[7:31] thereof and a cubit and a half the
[7:33] height thereof and thou shalt overlay it
[7:36] with pure gold within and without shalt
[7:38] thou overlay it and shall make upon it a
[7:41] crown of gold round about and thou shalt
[7:44] cast four rings of gold for it and put
[7:46] them in the four corners thereof and two
[7:49] rings shall be in the one side of it and
[7:51] two rings in the other side of it and
[7:54] thou shalt make staves of in wood
[7:57] and overlay them with gold
[7:59] and thou shall put staves in into the
[8:01] rings by the side of the ark that the
[8:04] ark may be born with them the staves
[8:07] shall be in the right in the rings of
[8:09] the ark they shall not be taken from it
[8:11] and thou shalt put into the ark the
[8:13] testimony which i shall give thee
[8:16] and and this is where i want to
[8:18] concentrate now and thou shalt make a
[8:20] mercy seat of pure gold
[8:23] two cubits and a half shall be the
[8:24] length thereof and the cubit and a half
[8:27] the breath thereof and thou shalt make
[8:30] two cherubims of gold
[8:32] of beaten work shall thou make them in
[8:34] the two ends of the mercy and make one
[8:37] cherub on the one end and the other
[8:39] cherub on the other end even of the
[8:41] mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims
[8:44] on the two ends thereof and the cherubim
[8:47] shall stretch forth their wings on high
[8:50] covering the mercy seat with their wings
[8:52] and their faces shall look one to
[8:54] another toward the mercy seat shall the
[8:58] faces of the cherubims be and thou shalt
[9:01] put the mercy seat
[9:03] above the ark
[9:05] now you watch the mercy seat was a
[9:08] separate part
[9:09] and we can bring it here in just a
[9:10] moment but a separate part from from the
[9:13] actual ark
[9:14] and thou shall put the mercy seat above
[9:17] upon the ark and in the ark
[9:20] in the ark thou shalt put the testimony
[9:22] that i shall give thee
[9:24] and there i will meet with thee watch
[9:26] and there i will meet with thee
[9:29] and i will
[9:31] commune with thee
[9:33] from above the mercy seat
[9:36] from between the two cherubims which are
[9:39] upon the ark of the testimony of all
[9:42] things which i will give thee in
[9:44] commandment unto the children of israel
[9:47] praise the lord jesus so
[9:48] you may be seated this morning
[9:53] um
[9:54] i don't know how
[9:56] we can bring this over here
[9:59] maybe just set it we'll set it on the
[10:00] piano the way it used to be
[10:07] praise the lord
[10:09] y'all see that okay
[10:11] all right
[10:14] so
[10:17] before we touch on that let's just read
[10:19] hebrews chapter 4
[10:21] hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 through 16.
[10:24] it says seeing that we have a great high
[10:27] priest
[10:28] that is passed into the heavens
[10:31] jesus the son of god
[10:34] let us hold fast our profession
[10:36] amen let us hold fast to that that you
[10:38] know that that you have experienced that
[10:40] you learned amen for we have not in high
[10:44] priest
[10:45] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[10:48] of our infirmities
[10:50] but
[10:51] was in all points tempted
[10:54] like as we are aren't you thankful that
[10:56] the lord jesus christ went through
[10:58] exactly what you're going through
[11:01] and probably a whole lot more
[11:04] amen
[11:05] yet without sin
[11:08] verse 16 let us therefore come
[11:13] weekly
[11:16] doubtful
[11:20] wishy-washy
[11:23] no
[11:24] let us therefore come boldly
[11:28] unto the throne of grace
[11:32] now i want you to i want you to to take
[11:34] a look that in the in the old testament
[11:37] it was the mercy seat
[11:39] now paul calls it the throne of grace
[11:43] that what that we may obtain that mercy
[11:48] and find grace and conjunction so now
[11:52] you just don't find grace you just don't
[11:54] find mercy you find both at the throne
[11:57] of grace
[11:58] that you may obtain mercy and find grace
[12:02] what
[12:03] in the time of your need
[12:07] praise the lord jesus hallelujah amen
[12:11] what what a blessed promise it is amen
[12:14] praise god so i i just want to talk
[12:16] about this morning and i want to tell
[12:18] you that you are cordially invited unto
[12:21] the throne of grace
[12:24] you are cordially invited unto the
[12:26] throne of grace

[13:36] england i mean that's up to you i'm just
[13:38] giving this as an example
[13:40] amen
[13:41] that would be a very special invitation
[13:44] right
[13:45] and you would make sure that you er
[13:49] it's it's something that you've never

[14:14] more
[14:15] god has given us jesus christ has given
[14:18] us an invitation in this hour
[14:22] let us therefore come
[14:24] boldly
[14:25] amen
[14:27] how many believe that it's god speaking
[14:28] through paul
[14:32] paul wasn't writing his own words that
[14:33] was jesus christ speaking through paul
[14:36] let us come boldly
[14:39] amen unto the throne of grace
[14:43] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[14:46] to help in the time of need to me that's
[14:49] an invitation that god is ready to meet
[14:52] your need
[14:54] god wants to meet your need god is is
[14:57] more than willing to to
[14:59] have fellowship with you in order so
[15:01] that he can find out what is going on
[15:04] what is happening because i want to meet
[15:07] your need i already done it now let me
[15:09] just go and meet it for you praise the
[15:12] lord jesus hallelujah
[15:14] amen but we see here in the in the in
[15:16] the tabernacle when we're looking here
[15:18] in the tabernacle uh uh um
[15:20] we look here that that that the
[15:22] tabernacle in the old testament uh as
[15:25] you know the the children of israel had
[15:27] to walk around in the desert with the
[15:29] tabernacle and and in the holies of
[15:32] holies i know we've been speaking about
[15:34] the different parts of the of of the
[15:36] tabernacle but in the holies of holies
[15:39] where the shekinah glory would come down
[15:42] and really the word shekinah isn't even
[15:44] anywhere in the bible but it's a hebrew
[15:46] word
[15:47] that that relates to god's presence amen
[15:50] it would come down when the when the
[15:53] children of israel when the high priest
[15:55] would go in there once a year
[15:57] with the blood of the of this of of a
[16:00] bull over over a lamb amen and would
[16:03] sprinkle that blood would go in behind
[16:05] the veil and remember he had to be
[16:07] dressed a certain way
[16:09] he had to he had to look a certain way
[16:12] he had to approach that that that that
[16:15] room in a certain way he had to go in
[16:18] there prayerfully hence that's the
[16:20] reason why he had to approach the altar
[16:23] of incense
[16:24] before he approached in there there had
[16:26] to be that smoke those prayers had to be
[16:29] there before he went behind that veil
[16:32] and so see saints that's the reason why
[16:34] we don't come to god
[16:36] any old way
[16:38] we come to god amen
[16:41] in in shamefulness in in in humbleness
[16:44] and humility in in in in gracious and
[16:47] this knowing that he
[16:49] i i'm at his mercy
[16:51] hey man how do you approach the queen of
[16:53] england
[16:56] what's up queen of england
[16:58] what's up dog
[17:00] what's up bro
[17:05] is that how we come to the queen of
[17:06] england
[17:08] i don't think i don't think even the the
[17:10] the the the biggest thug out there would
[17:13] even approach the queen of england that
[17:14] way
[17:15] no matter how much of a thug he says
[17:17] that he is and and all that amen it just
[17:20] makes me laugh you know some of the kids
[17:22] at school hey man they say they thugs
[17:23] that they carrying lunch trays
[17:26] a thug with a lunch tray
[17:29] and and following orders
[17:31] but yet you a thug
[17:37] [Laughter]
[17:40] but you see you would not approach the
[17:41] queen of england that way
[17:43] there is a reverent way to approach the
[17:46] queen of england there are certain
[17:47] things that you must do
[17:49] certain ways that you must look and so
[17:50] the high priest would approach
[17:52] god in this way he even had to smell a
[17:55] certain way
[17:58] nah
[17:59] think about that
[18:01] he had to even smell a certain way
[18:04] praise the lord and so when he would
[18:06] approach he would he would go back to
[18:08] behind the veil and i'm just trying to
[18:09] paint a picture for you he would have
[18:11] that charger or
[18:13] that charger with the blood amen fresh
[18:15] blood
[18:16] amen and he would go in there
[18:19] and he could not do anything else in
[18:21] there until he first sprinkled that
[18:23] blood
[18:24] on this mercy seat
[18:26] now the mercy seat
[18:28] is discovering i think this opens up
[18:32] there we go
[18:35] now
[18:36] this is the ark
[18:38] the ark is a box
[18:41] now for example in the bible when it
[18:43] mentions an ark for example it was
[18:45] noah's ark right it was a container of
[18:48] something
[18:49] valuables
[18:51] right
[18:52] noah's ark who was contained in it it
[18:54] was valuable people to god amen noah and
[18:57] his family the only ones that believed
[18:59] god in that hour praise the lord jesus
[19:02] that's why it was called the ark it's a
[19:04] it's it's a box it's it's it's a a
[19:07] container of valuables and so that's the
[19:09] reason why this was called the the ark
[19:11] of god amen the ark of the testament the
[19:13] ark of the covenant amen but on top of
[19:16] it was the mercy seat
[19:19] and it was a slab of gold
[19:23] that was separate from the from the from
[19:24] the from the from the ark but it was to
[19:28] cover the contents that were inside and
[19:31] the in the and the priests had to go
[19:32] behind here and sprinkle that blood
[19:35] a certain amount of times he had to
[19:37] sprinkle that blood and when god saw the
[19:40] blood
[19:41] amen then that shekinah glory would come
[19:43] down and that means he would say he
[19:45] accepted there's mercy again for the
[19:48] people for another year
[19:51] now it was called the mercy seat and
[19:54] we'll take it take a look at just a
[19:56] moment what what that is what is the
[19:58] difference between mercy and grace
[20:02] because there is a difference
[20:04] praise the lord
[20:07] and it's very interesting how how god
[20:09] when he started when we were reading
[20:11] here in exodus chapter 25 he starts
[20:14] mentioning in regards to the ark now pay
[20:16] attention he starts mentioning regards
[20:18] to the ark first in order for them to
[20:20] construct it but he starts telling them
[20:23] to construct it
[20:25] but he starts uh with
[20:28] with the ark the actual ark first he
[20:30] doesn't tell them
[20:32] come and construct the outside court
[20:34] first then the holy whole the holy place
[20:37] no he starts with the holy of holies
[20:40] first amen with the ark in other words
[20:43] with the heart of the matter praise the
[20:45] lord jesus
[20:46] that's where he starts telling them to
[20:48] start working working on or at least
[20:50] that's how he explains it there in in
[20:52] exodus chapter 25 which is that's what
[20:55] god does with us amen
[20:57] he's he he doesn't care about how you
[21:00] dress
[21:01] as long as amen
[21:03] he cares about how you dress don't get
[21:05] me wrong or the outsides of it but what
[21:07] he cares most is about getting you right
[21:10] inside first
[21:12] because many people try to get right on
[21:15] the outside get everything right on the
[21:17] outside first and nothing inside has
[21:19] happened
[21:21] and you are just only living a life of
[21:24] hypocrisy
[21:26] amen but when god god starts telling
[21:28] them hey go to the root of the matter
[21:31] first
[21:32] amen and then work yourself out the
[21:35] outside then everything the all the
[21:37] other furniture that piece of furniture
[21:40] god starts talking about first
[21:43] and god wants your heart first your
[21:45] peace that piece of furniture is what
[21:47] god wants first because he knows if he
[21:49] can turn your heart
[21:51] amen then he can have the rest of you
[21:53] amen
[21:55] if he could just turn your heart first
[21:58] not just your eyes
[21:59] i love the song turn your eyes upon
[22:01] jesus but amen let's turn our hearts
[22:03] upon jesus
[22:05] amen because let us we want to look with
[22:07] our heart we want to look with our
[22:09] hearts
[22:10] amen praise god
[22:12] so he always starts with the heart
[22:14] and he builds his way out
[22:17] amen
[22:18] many people that have come to church you
[22:20] know you know it that they have come and
[22:22] been excited and you've seen them change
[22:24] ways on the outside but now they're not
[22:27] here anymore
[22:29] for whatever reason maybe they've moved
[22:31] or something like that but but maybe
[22:33] they've fallen spiritually
[22:35] why because the work wasn't done
[22:37] inwardly first they there was not that
[22:40] inward work there was not that inward
[22:42] thing that happened that inward
[22:44] relationship between god and and and
[22:46] that person
[22:48] and therefore you see them fall off
[22:51] you see people fall off die off get
[22:53] bored never come to church again do
[22:55] everything contrary to to what you what
[22:59] they felt
[23:01] i feel so good i'm so happy about god
[23:04] let's see five years later down the road
[23:06] where they're at
[23:08] that's the reason why sayings you are
[23:10] blessed amen that god has still
[23:12] preserved you even in this hour
[23:14] you you are blessed people that you are
[23:17] still persevering
[23:18] yeah the way hasn't been easy everything
[23:20] has been tough you've had to deal you've
[23:22] had to deal with family you've had to
[23:24] deal with problems at church you've had
[23:25] to deal with all kinds of things maybe
[23:28] troubles at work amen but you are still
[23:30] persevering and it doesn't matter what
[23:32] happens on the outside you are still
[23:34] here because god has called you god
[23:37] has started to work in you
[23:42] god has started to work in you that's
[23:44] the most important thing
[23:48] so now this arkan this ark right here
[23:50] this chest or this coffer
[23:53] because back in that day in the day you
[23:55] know people held coffers and chests in
[23:58] their place in their house and it was to
[24:00] hold valuables
[24:01] right and when you would go visit that
[24:04] your uncle you know during christmas
[24:05] time or during thanksgiving i don't know
[24:08] they didn't have that back then but i'm
[24:09] just saying you go visit your uncle your
[24:12] uncle and uh he'd be like hey son look
[24:15] look what i got here and he'd pull out
[24:16] his ark his his his uh his chest full of
[24:20] goodies and check out this this this
[24:22] this gun i got the other day look at you
[24:26] we went the other way the other day when
[24:27] we was at brother elisha's house i'm
[24:29] sure maybe they're watching in right now
[24:31] he took us down to his basement now over
[24:33] there in lorraine ohio those houses they
[24:35] look they look like they're small
[24:38] but man they got some huge basements
[24:40] i mean up north and i know in toronto
[24:43] where my wife grew up
[24:45] you know they make the houses like that
[24:47] they look small on the outside but
[24:50] under it's a whole new different world
[24:52] [Laughter]
[24:53] brother elisha took us downstairs down
[24:56] to the basement and he showed us all his
[24:57] goodies in his coffer
[25:01] he had guns he had fishing rods he had
[25:03] all kinds of stuff
[25:05] amen because we were his guests
[25:08] and you know what saints
[25:09] god has played had placed goodies in
[25:12] this box right here for the high priest
[25:14] to take a look at
[25:16] amen
[25:18] every time that he went back there
[25:20] praise god he could go and step in and
[25:22] look at those goodies
[25:24] amen and it wasn't just goodies it was
[25:26] it was the the it was the word the
[25:28] commandments amen it was the manna that
[25:30] never spoiled and it was aaron's rod
[25:32] that that butted
[25:34] and then and that would just bring a
[25:36] fresh joy to him once again
[25:38] praise the lord jesus
[25:40] but in this
[25:42] in this arc there were there were there
[25:44] were special things that were stored in
[25:45] there now i want you to think about that
[25:47] in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7
[25:49] paul told us this he says but we have
[25:52] this treasure
[25:53] in what
[25:55] in earthen vessels
[25:57] the treasure of christ amen the treasure
[26:00] that god paid for christ paid for now
[26:03] that treasure is not just laying in a
[26:04] box
[26:06] amen that word is not just now in a box
[26:08] that word now is living in jars of clay
[26:12] [Laughter]
[26:13] praise god is now living in a flesh
[26:16] people amen in a body
[26:18] and as i mentioned last time god wasn't
[26:20] just interested in dwelling in in a
[26:24] in a holy of holies and then in
[26:26] solomon's temple and then it not even
[26:30] just pleased although he was pleased but
[26:33] not just pleased with dwelling in jesus
[26:38] because the body of jesus was an ark
[26:41] right
[26:43] now he wants to dwell in a people
[26:46] and he wants a he wants to walk into
[26:48] people he wants to talk through people
[26:50] he wants to live through a people
[26:52] and that's the ultimate saint
[26:54] the ultimate is that god can dwell in a
[26:58] in a sinful a
[27:00] person's heart because he has changed it
[27:03] from the inside out
[27:06] you who are a drunkard you who are a
[27:08] fornicator you who were vile you who
[27:10] were you were all of this and yet god
[27:13] told you to come boldly yes oh god
[27:17] that's mercy and that's grace
[27:20] you don't deserve it i don't neither but
[27:22] he invited us to it
[27:24] and when we don't go amen that's between
[27:27] that that's up to you but the invitation
[27:30] is open
[27:31] the invitation is open praise the lord
[27:34] jesus
[27:35] amen
[27:37] so you can see the mercy seat was only
[27:40] just a cover or a lid
[27:42] right
[27:43] and remember there was blood sprinkled
[27:45] on it air year after year so it was it
[27:48] was blood-stained
[27:50] right
[27:51] it was blood-stained but you see it was
[27:54] only a cover
[27:57] and it could not take the people's sins
[27:59] away
[28:00] it was only just to cover sins
[28:02] it's interesting that god told him to to
[28:05] to place the blood there
[28:07] amen so it was only a cover
[28:10] and
[28:11] no one literally
[28:13] sat on that mercy seat
[28:17] no one physically sat on it even though
[28:19] it was called the mercy seat
[28:21] no one literally sat on that mercy seat
[28:24] amen because it it was just only for the
[28:28] sprinkling of the blood praise god and
[28:29] we're going to get to something here
[28:30] just a moment amen
[28:34] amen hence the fact that sins
[28:37] were only covered
[28:39] amen and they were not done away with
[28:43] amen sins were only covered and not done
[28:45] away with not eradicated they were only
[28:48] covered praise god
[28:49] amen
[28:52] and this mercy seat saints was the only
[28:54] place amen within the ark to obtain
[28:57] mercy
[28:59] amen when the high priest would go in
[29:01] there it was the only place that he had
[29:03] that he couldn't sprinkle the blood
[29:05] anywhere else
[29:06] it had to be behind it would have to be
[29:09] on this mercy seat he can sprinkle the
[29:11] blood on the on the on the altar of
[29:13] incense he couldn't sprinkle the blood
[29:15] anywhere else it had to be on top of
[29:17] this mercy seat in order to obtain mercy
[29:20] amen praise god now i want us to read
[29:22] here in hebrews chapter 10 if the
[29:24] brothers can bring it up hebrews chapter
[29:26] 10
[29:27] verse 9
[29:32] watch what paul says here
[29:34] he says dan said he lo
[29:37] i come to do thy will o god he taketh
[29:41] away the first
[29:43] that he may establish the second
[29:45] speaking of the old covenant now he
[29:47] establishing the second covenant
[29:49] by the which
[29:51] will
[29:52] by the which will we are sanctified
[29:55] through the offering
[29:57] of the body of jesus christ
[30:01] once
[30:02] for all
[30:03] amen
[30:05] and every
[30:06] priest standeth not watch i want you to
[30:09] pay attention to that every priest
[30:11] standeth
[30:13] daily ministering
[30:15] and offering oftentimes the same
[30:18] sacrifices which can never take away
[30:20] sins notice how paul uses the word
[30:22] standeth
[30:23] or standing
[30:25] because there was nowhere when the ch
[30:27] when the priest would go in there and
[30:30] then the high priest would go inside
[30:32] that holy of holies amen there was no
[30:34] seat in that tabernacle
[30:38] none of the furniture there was a chair
[30:40] in there for them to sit at
[30:44] now maybe they might add it later but
[30:46] then that's man involving themselves and
[30:48] adding things in into into god's word
[30:50] that has no business being there
[30:52] that's the reason why we get in trouble
[30:54] sometimes
[30:55] when we add things that don't don't
[30:57] necessarily not in line with his word we
[30:59] get in trouble
[31:01] amen when you add your own opinion or
[31:03] your own chair in there
[31:06] for you to rest on that
[31:08] god doesn't care about your chair
[31:11] amen god wants you to do it according to
[31:14] his word
[31:15] praise the lord jesus
[31:17] exactly according to his word
[31:19] now he says here and so the priest
[31:21] always would have to be standing they'd
[31:24] go in there standing
[31:26] and the high priest would go behind that
[31:28] holy of holies standing
[31:30] offering the whole that blood there on
[31:32] the mercy and he says but this man
[31:37] what man
[31:40] but this man jesus christ
[31:42] after he had offered one sacrifice one
[31:45] sacrifice four sins
[31:47] forever
[31:48] sat down
[31:52] now now why is it that paul is so
[31:54] concentrated on standing up and sitting
[31:56] down
[31:57] see
[31:59] he offered sacrifice for sins forever
[32:03] sat down on the right hand of god
[32:07] what is the right hand of god
[32:09] it's the power of god amen
[32:12] from henceforth expecting till his
[32:14] enemies be made his footstool for by one
[32:17] offering
[32:18] he have perfected forever them that are
[32:21] sanctified uh how many here are
[32:23] sanctified
[32:25] so you've been perfected right
[32:29] i want you to look at the word and you
[32:30] start confessing yourself in that word
[32:32] putting yourself in that word amen
[32:35] so i want you to take a look here just a
[32:37] moment
[32:38] jesus christ when he went behind the
[32:41] veil spiritually
[32:43] right
[32:44] he didn't he didn't stand
[32:47] amen he sat down for good
[32:50] and what does a king do amen when he
[32:53] sits
[32:54] on a throne when he conquers a a a land
[32:58] when he conquers another country when he
[33:00] conquers a people what does he do in
[33:02] order to to to to to let the people know
[33:05] hey
[33:06] i'm in charge now
[33:08] he sits on that throne
[33:10] he sits on that throne amen
[33:13] praise god now you say oh it's just
[33:15] jesus he's sitting on the throne and
[33:17] he's he's conquered everything he's
[33:19] conquered death hell and the grave and
[33:21] that's wonderful but the thing is saints
[33:23] is that he wants us to sit with him
[33:27] and look what ephesians tells us praise
[33:29] god
[33:32] well if you continue reading there it
[33:34] says from henceforth expecting to his
[33:35] enemies well we already at that for by
[33:37] one offering he hath perfected forever
[33:39] them that are sanctified
[33:43] and then ephesians 2 verse 4 tells us
[33:45] but god who is rich in mercy
[33:48] for his great love
[33:50] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[33:52] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[33:55] with christ by grace are ye saved
[33:59] amen aren't you thankful for his grace
[34:02] watch this in verse 6 and hath raised us
[34:05] up together and made us
[34:08] sit together
[34:10] so it's not just god now sitting it's
[34:13] not just jesus christ sitting amen
[34:16] but he is not we are now sitting
[34:18] together in heavenly places in christ
[34:21] jesus do you believe that
[34:23] praise the lord
[34:24] amen we are now sitting together with
[34:27] him in christ jesus in other words the
[34:30] power that he obtained we got
[34:33] the mercy that he is we are
[34:37] we just didn't obtain mercy we are mercy
[34:41] he is not just he didn't just obtain
[34:44] mercy he is mercy
[34:47] amen he is grace
[34:49] i believe there's actually a song that
[34:50] sister brenda lewis wrote that was
[34:52] called we are mercy we are grace
[34:54] amen we are mercy
[34:56] we are grace in this hour he is mercy he
[35:00] is grace he's not just he cannot just
[35:03] provide those things for us but he is
[35:06] those things to us
[35:07] praise the lord jesus
[35:09] amen so the believer now sits and rests
[35:13] with him on that on that seat amen
[35:16] you are just as much powerful as he is
[35:19] you are you have much just just as much
[35:21] right as he does amen that's the reason
[35:23] why he raised when he conquered death
[35:25] and the grave he rose and he said all
[35:27] power is given unto me both in heaven
[35:31] and in earth
[35:32] praise god
[35:35] and did you raise with him when he rose
[35:39] did you die with him when he died
[35:42] amen were you there when he amen in the
[35:45] life yes you were there
[35:48] you weren't physically there but you
[35:49] were there in life
[35:51] praise god in his life because his
[35:53] eternal life right
[35:55] so you are just as much powerful amen as
[35:58] he is now he is not now is he's not just
[36:01] a high priest that went back there one
[36:03] time and offered it and then the good
[36:05] let's wait for another year no he sat
[36:07] down on this
[36:10] he said go ahead and just rent that bell
[36:14] and that that's why that veil was rent
[36:16] amen
[36:18] that's why that village rent from top to
[36:20] bottom
[36:22] signaling that it was god that was doing
[36:24] the work here
[36:25] and it was it's not a man thing praise
[36:27] the lord jesus amen so
[36:30] but the problem that we have and i
[36:31] mentioned this last time is that we like
[36:33] to just sew that thing back up
[36:36] we like to sew that veil back up with
[36:39] our own ideas
[36:41] with our own things with our own
[36:44] opinions and and we're the ones who make
[36:47] a division between you and god
[36:50] god doesn't make the division you make
[36:52] the division
[36:53] because let me tell you when you open
[36:55] that that veil god is still sitting
[36:57] there waiting for you where
[36:58] the way you left them that's the way
[37:00] he's going to be
[37:02] amen the way you left him that's where
[37:04] you'll find him praise the lord jesus
[37:06] amen
[37:07] so
[37:08] and half verse 6 and hath raised us up
[37:10] together and made us sit together in
[37:13] heavenly places in christ jesus that in
[37:16] the ages to come he might show the
[37:19] exceeding riches of his grace
[37:23] amen
[37:24] you know brother john showed that
[37:25] picture of a of a cake there and it
[37:27] looked nice and rich

[37:40] how many like some rich cake
[37:45] how many like cake that just
[37:47] chocolate cake that just sort of tastes
[37:49] like chocolate

[37:54] chocolatey right

[38:31] condemnation you don't want it to taste
[38:33] like you shouldn't have done this you
[38:35] shouldn't have done that and then you
[38:36] want it to taste like grace because
[38:38] that's what you approach god for
[38:41] hey man you when you go for mercy you
[38:44] want it to taste like mercy because
[38:45] that's what you approach god for
[38:48] amen
[38:50] and he wants to give it to you he's
[38:51] ready to give you that chocolate cake
[38:55] amen it's right there
[38:58] come taste the richness of the goodness
[39:00] of the mercy and the grace of god amen

[39:05] overcome the devil i've overcome hell
[39:08] i've overcome the grave i'm sitting in
[39:10] my throne and now you can come
[39:12] boldly praise god
[39:15] hallelujah
[39:17] amen he's and that's what he wants us to
[39:19] do
[39:20] because he just doesn't want to sit
[39:22] there on his own
[39:24] he wants us to
[39:26] overcome alongside with him
[39:29] to sit with him
[39:31] you know when you see the queen of
[39:32] england
[39:33] or when you see kings and queens in the
[39:35] past
[39:36] you normally see the king and the queen
[39:38] sitting next to each other
[39:41] that's how god sees you right now
[39:47] god is not looking at your faults
[39:50] god is not looking at your failures
[39:52] god is only looking at the work that he
[39:54] did god is looking at the blood that
[39:57] he's already sprinkled amen shed it
[40:00] wasn't just sprinkled it was shed
[40:02] amen and he's looking amen at the power
[40:05] that i have to free you from whatever
[40:07] problem you have
[40:10] you might say oh i'm i'm i can't go to
[40:14] god i'm i've done so much i've i've i've
[40:17] sinned my way out of grace no you
[40:19] haven't
[40:21] none of us have
[40:23] none of us have because you are still
[40:25] living and breathing you're still here
[40:29] you can't sin too much and you can't
[40:32] fail god too much that his mercy and
[40:34] grace can't keep can't pick you back
[40:36] up the thing is is that we need to come
[40:39] boldly knowing that
[40:42] amen
[40:43] praise the lord so just as jesus christ
[40:46] as i said mentioned earlier just as
[40:48] jesus christ is mercy and grace
[40:51] amen we who are in him
[40:54] and he and us are also
[40:56] mercy and grace we just don't get mercy
[40:58] and grace we are mercy and grace
[41:00] amen by the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:04] so if he's mercy and grace and you have
[41:06] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:08] and you are mercy and grace
[41:10] then what should you be what should you
[41:12] do for others

[41:30] he just choose gum all up in the church
[41:32] house
[41:33] man and uh man i just can't stand the
[41:35] way he does it and the way
[41:37] you you know
[41:39] i just can't
[41:40] amen
[41:42] what about mercy and
[41:46] grace know sometimes we're so quick to
[41:49] just
[41:50] throw it out and shell it out on people
[41:52] and we don't look at ourselves
[41:56] we don't look where we're wrong
[41:59] amen it's somebody else's fault that
[42:02] that that that things are happening the
[42:03] way they are but it's never your fault
[42:09] it's never your fault you don't look at
[42:11] yourself but you look at others
[42:14] i think that's a problem
[42:16] amen
[42:18] you are in need you're standing in need
[42:20] of much more mercy and grace than
[42:22] anybody else
[42:25] just as much
[42:26] i'm not saying more but just as much
[42:29] amen
[42:31] oh we love to condemn
[42:35] but if you say you're a christian and
[42:37] you have his mercy and his grace yet you
[42:39] don't shell it out
[42:44] then who are we
[42:46] are we really christians because let me
[42:48] tell you saying god saved you when you
[42:50] were unsavable
[42:52] i know this is simple amen
[42:54] but let me tell you what amen some of us
[42:57] need that
[42:58] some of us need this
[42:59] you were unsavable you were you were
[43:02] heading to hell just like i was just
[43:05] like any of one of us were you needed
[43:08] just as much of his grace and his mercy
[43:11] and the
[43:12] wonderful thing is is that he's ready to
[43:14] give it to you
[43:16] so you can't send away your day
[43:19] so far that he he he can't provide you
[43:22] mercy and grace
[43:24] or better yet that he can't make you
[43:26] mercy and grace
[43:28] hallelujah amen
[43:32] and he says here that in the ages to
[43:33] come he might show the exceeding riches
[43:36] of his grace
[43:38] in his kindness toward us through christ
[43:40] jesus for by grace are ye saved through
[43:44] faith
[43:45] and not and that not of yourselves it is
[43:48] the gift of god
[43:50] amen if i give uh
[43:52] zach a gift i don't expect for him to
[43:55] return it back to me give it back to me
[43:57] i'm not going to ask him for that again
[44:00] because that was a gift for him
[44:03] praise the lord
[44:05] that's his
[44:07] amen ephesians 1 6 through 7 to the
[44:10] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[44:12] he hath made us accepted
[44:15] and i like the way he uses this word he
[44:17] says in the beloved
[44:21] not with the beloved but in the beloved
[44:25] in
[44:26] verse 7 in
[44:28] whom we have redemption through
[44:30] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[44:34] according to the riches of what
[44:37] of his grace
[44:41] now it's not just grace this in the sour
[44:43] saints
[44:45] it's that double double
[44:47] it's that double grace
[44:50] and we'll talk about that here in just a
[44:52] moment praise god
[44:55] so saints this mercy seat right here
[44:58] you notice in this in the new testament
[45:01] is not called
[45:03] it is not called mercy seed anymore
[45:07] amen we reference to it as mercy seat
[45:10] but now it's become a throne of grace
[45:15] so now it's not just the holies of
[45:17] holies now it's a throne room
[45:19] praise the lord jesus
[45:21] all right so going back to hebrews 4 16
[45:23] it says let us therefore
[45:26] come
[45:27] boldly
[45:29] you know looking at that word it just
[45:30] reminds me of just brother boyd
[45:34] that word boldly
[45:36] brother boyd for the boy's got that bold
[45:38] beard
[45:39] [Laughter]
[45:42] come boldly amen unto the throne of
[45:47] grace
[45:48] that we may obtain mercy
[45:51] now mercy the mercy the the obtaining of
[45:54] mercy is still there
[45:56] but now as we're coming unto the throne
[45:59] of grace in order to obtain mercy
[46:03] and find grace to help in the time of
[46:05] need zechariah 4 7 tells us this who art
[46:08] thou a great mountain before zerubbabel
[46:10] what thou shalt become a plain and he
[46:13] shall bring forth the headstone
[46:16] thereof with shoutings
[46:19] crying grace
[46:22] grace
[46:23] unto it
[46:24] amen
[46:26] so i believe that that's speaking of
[46:28] this headstone right
[46:31] so in this hour saints
[46:33] it's not just grace it's double grace
[46:37] well you don't know what sister
[46:39] so-and-so did to me you better apply
[46:41] that double grace
[46:43] well you don't know what brother rubs me
[46:45] off the wrong way every time i look at
[46:46] him you better apply that double grace
[46:49] brother don't even say anything to me he
[46:50] don't even shake his hand he just walked
[46:51] right by me and just amen double grace
[46:59] double grace in this hour
[47:00] because you know what you know what's
[47:02] going to uh
[47:03] what's going to invite people
[47:06] it's your double grace
[47:08] what's going to attract people to jesus
[47:10] christ your double grace
[47:12] it ain't going to be your condemnation
[47:14] or you better do it like this that and
[47:16] the other pow
[47:19] no it's going to be your double grace
[47:22] you know what that man that guy
[47:25] that says who's a crazy christian
[47:28] he is a christian
[47:30] man look look look at the stuff that i
[47:32] do
[47:33] around him and stuff like that and he
[47:35] still treats me right
[47:38] look how much i've failed and yet he's
[47:40] still isn't that god
[47:43] look at you the way you fail him on a
[47:46] daily basis
[47:48] and he still meets my needs and he still
[47:51] loves me and he still supplies
[47:53] everything that i need and he still
[47:55] gives me his word
[47:57] isn't that god
[48:00] amen
[48:02] [Applause]
[48:04] sure there's people out there that don't
[48:05] deserve it
[48:06] i and i was one of them
[48:09] and you were one of them
[48:12] but we need it
[48:14] and they need it
[48:16] and you and i are the only people that
[48:18] can offer it to them
[48:21] if we have the the the if we have that
[48:24] grace in us
[48:26] who is the lord jesus christ
[48:29] so zechariah tells us crying grace grace
[48:32] unto it amen
[48:34] think about this saints
[48:37] when jesus christ died and rose from the
[48:40] grave
[48:41] now you you look at many examples of
[48:43] jesus life with his disciples the three
[48:46] and a half years that he spent with his
[48:47] disciples look at the time when peter
[48:50] was walking on the water
[48:52] amen how god jesus displayed his mercy
[48:55] amen and picked peter off the water even
[48:57] in his unbelieving hour and man we've
[48:59] talked about that and i love that story
[49:01] amen we just had a good time last sunday
[49:04] man i preached about i preached that
[49:06] message come and at their brother gene
[49:08] williams church man and we just had we
[49:10] just had such a good time man
[49:12] and i hadn't had church like that in a
[49:13] long time and it just felt so good
[49:17] they they preach you to death over there
[49:20] but
[49:22] and uh so
[49:24] they um
[49:26] so jesus
[49:28] showed mercy showed grace but
[49:30] but you watch after jesus died and
[49:32] resurrected
[49:35] it wasn't
[49:37] the disciples going to lo go look for
[49:39] the disciple for jesus
[49:42] it was jesus going to go look for the
[49:44] disciples
[49:46] because when he was erected he told he
[49:48] was so concerned about peter he was so
[49:50] concerned about the disciples that he
[49:52] even told mary magdalene he said you go
[49:54] tell peter
[49:57] name them by name
[49:58] go tell them disciples
[50:00] about what you just saw
[50:02] and what happens they're there booing
[50:05] and crying in a room and scared
[50:07] [Music]
[50:09] president biden's gonna raise our taxes
[50:11] [Laughter]
[50:15] oh
[50:16] my
[50:17] look at
[50:18] all this stuff that's going on
[50:21] and jesus just appears before them and
[50:23] says fear not
[50:26] he didn't tell them anything else
[50:28] at the beginning he just said fear not
[50:33] fear not
[50:35] if your taxes get frozen
[50:38] they rise oh well
[50:40] god will make a way
[50:43] amen biting isn't god
[50:46] amen i am god
[50:48] i am god and why i am sitting on the
[50:51] throne remember all power is given unto
[50:54] me
[50:55] both in heaven and in earth
[50:58] amen praise the lord jesus
[51:02] biden never said that
[51:04] amen the cia never said that
[51:07] the fbi never says that the irs
[51:10] definitely never said that
[51:11] but jesus christ in his word said that
[51:14] so who are you going to believe
[51:17] amen his word is our absolute praise the
[51:20] lord jesus he comes in there and he
[51:22] appears before them and he tells them
[51:24] fear not and he goes to them
[51:27] he doesn't wait for them to come to him
[51:29] he goes to them
[51:31] and applies
[51:33] what
[51:33] double grace
[51:35] because because listen peter had denied
[51:38] jesus
[51:40] peter man he was he was gone
[51:42] i mean he was like he was in sin
[51:46] he didn't deserve nothing from him
[51:48] anymore
[51:50] and yet god jesus christ goes to them
[51:54] amen and applies double grace
[51:58] let us take it a step further
[52:00] he leaves them for several days
[52:03] and they go off fishing they say well i
[52:06] don't know if he's going to come back
[52:07] again i don't know if he's going to ever
[52:10] just appear before us again i don't know
[52:12] if he'll ever do that again so i'm just
[52:14] going to go back to doing what i'm doing
[52:16] and i wonder if that's just kind of like
[52:18] us sometimes
[52:19] oh we have one experience with god and
[52:21] then several days have passed and and
[52:24] months pass and you don't see the lord
[52:26] doing something in your life again well
[52:27] let me just go back to doing what i used
[52:29] to do
[52:30] that makes me feel good
[52:32] amen that makes that helps me helps me
[52:35] enjoy my flesh a little bit more amen
[52:37] something fleshly
[52:38] and you know what they went back to
[52:40] fishing
[52:42] and jesus goes to them and meets them
[52:45] where they were at
[52:47] he goes to the shore
[52:49] to the beach and he's there probably
[52:51] watching them and he's cooking fish
[52:56] and and he never went fishing himself
[53:00] they go to the shore they come to the
[53:02] shore and and they're like
[53:04] you know after they realize it was jesus
[53:06] they come to the shore and he's there
[53:07] cooking fish and jesus was never
[53:09] anywhere on the boat with them
[53:11] he just told him you you go ahead and
[53:14] set that that uh to the side and they
[53:16] caught their fish but when they came to
[53:18] the bank he was already cooking fish oh
[53:20] my that's like jesus amen
[53:22] praise god
[53:24] but what was he there for
[53:26] he was there to reiterate that grace
[53:30] to them
[53:31] did they deserve it
[53:33] no they didn't
[53:35] especially peter
[53:38] you know peter means a rock
[53:40] that's a hard man
[53:43] that's a hard person it's hard to deal
[53:45] with hard people
[53:48] but that's who god that's what jesus
[53:50] wanted more
[53:52] that's what jesus wanted more he wanted
[53:54] the hardest case
[53:56] to deal with the hardest case
[53:59] sometimes we give people up so easily
[54:02] when in reality those are the ones who
[54:04] usually come out
[54:06] better than many
[54:08] because those are the ones who truly
[54:10] experienced the grace of god
[54:13] amen
[54:14] praise the lord jesus so jesus applies
[54:17] his double grace there amen
[54:19] amen let's just move quickly
[54:21] amen
[54:23] what is the difference between mercy and
[54:24] grace mercy is the act
[54:27] of withholding deserved punishment
[54:30] so the high priest would come in here
[54:31] every year the children of israel had
[54:33] sinned that whole year but when that
[54:36] blood was applied
[54:38] mercy was applied to the people
[54:40] right so it was mercy is the act of
[54:43] withholding deserve punishment
[54:45] and it was only withholding for for a
[54:47] year every year that priest that high
[54:49] priest had to go back in there to apply
[54:51] the blood but but
[54:53] well watch what grace is grace is the
[54:55] act of giving unmerited favor
[55:01] amen
[55:02] you don't deserve it but i'm going to
[55:03] give it to you
[55:08] i want you to think about that for a
[55:09] moment
[55:11] all right you
[55:12] you know mercy if mercy is god
[55:15] acknowledging hey yeah you sinned
[55:18] you did wrong
[55:20] but you do something and then i'll apply
[55:22] i'll forgive you for that right grace is
[55:26] just unmerited grace
[55:28] amen
[55:31] unmerited favor you don't have to do
[55:33] anything amen
[55:36] you get grace
[55:37] now don't get me wrong amen
[55:40] you
[55:41] you've got to come to god amen in order
[55:43] to obtain
[55:44] mercy and grace you've got to humble
[55:46] yourself amen you've got to ask for
[55:49] forgiveness
[55:50] your mom can't do it and your dad can't
[55:52] do it nobody can do it for you you've
[55:54] got to do it for yourself
[55:57] because you have to experience it for
[55:59] yourself
[56:00] mercy and grace watch are two sides of a
[56:03] coin
[56:04] and the coin is love
[56:08] yeah you have a coin you got two sides
[56:11] they they're part of the same coin and
[56:13] that coin is love
[56:14] amen the love of god
[56:17] praise the lord jesus now i want us to
[56:19] look here in regards to thinking about
[56:22] that now we are sitting in heavenly
[56:24] places
[56:25] in christ jesus we're not standing we're
[56:27] not like the priests anymore standing
[56:29] doing works and and then doing what
[56:31] we're supposed to do you know every year
[56:32] and and
[56:34] i'm going to do it like this and doing
[56:35] that no no no now we are sitting we are
[56:38] what resting
[56:39] together in him
[56:41] right
[56:42] if you read with me in esther chapter 5
[56:45] verses 1 through 3.
[56:49] now it's so interesting that this this
[56:51] this chapter is the number 5.
[56:56] what does 5 represent
[56:58] grace
[57:02] now it came to pass on the third day
[57:05] that esther put on her royal apparel let
[57:08] me background here if you don't know
[57:10] there was several days several months
[57:13] actually i think
[57:14] that
[57:15] queen esther had not fellowshipped with
[57:17] the king
[57:21] queen esther was was was was a christian
[57:24] i'm just saying i'm bringing it down
[57:26] today
[57:27] right back then there was nothing like
[57:29] that but queen esther had gotten saved
[57:32] she heard the message
[57:33] she knew she was part of the bride
[57:35] she was a queen she knew that but
[57:38] something happened that she lost
[57:40] communication with the king
[57:43] she lost that that that that fellowship
[57:46] with the king
[57:47] i wonder if that doesn't happen to us
[57:50] if we're not careful we are very
[57:53] quick to lose communication with our
[57:55] king
[57:56] and then we're wondering what is
[57:57] happening the king doesn't want to see
[57:59] me anymore now you're making judgments
[58:01] you're making prejudgments that god
[58:03] doesn't want to speak to you that god
[58:04] doesn't want to that you're now in
[58:06] condemnation that now you are not he
[58:08] won't ever forgive you and that was far
[58:10] from the truth
[58:12] that was the things that esther was
[58:13] thinking about because he was saying how
[58:16] can i approach the king now because if i
[58:18] go and approach him now it'll just be
[58:20] dead he won't want to receive me anymore
[58:22] she had not had that intimate
[58:24] time with the king
[58:28] but she just said you know what he told
[58:31] me to come boldly just as he said in
[58:33] hebrews amen and so i'm just going to go
[58:35] in boldly
[58:37] amen that's what the bride says in this
[58:39] hour now it came to pass on the third
[58:41] day
[58:42] that esther put on her royal apparel
[58:46] and stood in the inner court of the
[58:48] king's house just as the high priest
[58:51] would have to put on his apparel to
[58:54] enter into the holies of holies right
[58:58] just as you have to put a certain
[59:00] apparel before you go meet the queen of
[59:01] england
[59:04] amen
[59:05] or somebody important
[59:09] esther had to go put on her apparel
[59:12] before she went to meet the king
[59:14] now remember the king already knew
[59:16] her the king already
[59:19] she was the queen
[59:21] she was part of him
[59:24] right
[59:26] yet she still had to do these things
[59:29] amen
[59:30] in the inner court of the king's house
[59:32] over against the king's house and the
[59:34] king watched and the king sat
[59:37] upon his royal throne
[59:40] remember what did jesus christ do
[59:43] he sat
[59:44] on the throne amen
[59:47] in the royal house over against the gate
[59:49] of the house
[59:50] and it was so
[59:52] when the king
[59:54] wasn't that esther saw but it was when
[59:56] the king saw esther the queen standing
[1:00:00] in the court see the queen was she was
[1:00:03] worried she was she was standing when
[1:00:04] she
[1:00:05] she should have been sitting
[1:00:07] next to him
[1:00:09] but she's standing doing trying to do
[1:00:11] her own thing amen for months and so
[1:00:14] when the king saw esther the queen
[1:00:16] standing in the court
[1:00:18] that she obtained favor in his sight
[1:00:23] and the king held out to esther the
[1:00:25] golden scepter
[1:00:27] that was in his hand
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] so esther
[1:00:32] drew near
[1:00:34] and touched the top of the scepter
[1:00:38] amen that golden scepter is like the the
[1:00:41] gold the mercy seat amen is made out of
[1:00:44] gold
[1:00:45] then said the king unto her
[1:00:47] what wilt doubt queen esther in other
[1:00:49] words what do you need queen esther
[1:00:52] amen and what is thy request
[1:00:55] it shall be even given thee
[1:00:58] to the half
[1:01:00] of the kingdom
[1:01:02] i like the difference of this is that
[1:01:03] god has given us all everything already
[1:01:07] he ain't going to just give us half amen
[1:01:09] he's given us everything all power is
[1:01:11] given unto him both in heaven and earth
[1:01:13] and if you abide in him and he abides in
[1:01:15] you all that power belongs to you amen
[1:01:18] praise god
[1:01:20] so esther
[1:01:21] had to come before the king in a certain
[1:01:24] way
[1:01:25] and and she was the one that needed
[1:01:28] grace and there was grace there for her
[1:01:30] to receive
