[39:18] desires to be centered solely upon you
[39:21] and the word of the hour guide us now in
[39:25] Jesus name
[39:26] amen
[39:29] Ephesians
[39:31] one we begin in verse three
[39:35] blessed be the God and father of our
[39:37] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[39:39] with all spiritual blessings we're at
[39:41] now in Heavenly places in Christ
[39:44] according as he had chosen Us in him
[39:47] before the foundation of the world that
[39:49] we should be holy and Without Blame
[39:51] before him in love having predestinated
[39:54] us unto the adoption of children by
[39:56] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[39:59] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[40:01] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[40:03] hath made us accepted in the Beloved in
[40:07] whom we have Redemption through his
[40:09] blood to forgiveness of sins
[40:11] according to the riches of his grace
[40:13] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[40:16] all wisdom and prudence having made
[40:18] known unto us the mystery of his will
[40:20] according to his good pleasure which he
[40:23] had purposed in himself
[40:25] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[40:27] of time now here's the the whole thing
[40:30] that you know bringing it down
[40:32] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[40:35] of times he might gather together in one
[40:37] all things in Christ both which are in
[40:40] heaven and which are on earth even in
[40:43] him in whom also we have obtained an
[40:45] inheritance being predestinated
[40:48] according to the purpose of him who
[40:49] worketh all things after the Council of
[40:52] his own will that we should be to the
[40:54] praise of his glory he first trusted in
[40:58] Christ
[41:01] now let's go over to First John 5 just
[41:04] one verse verse 20.
[41:10] and we know that the Son of God is come
[41:13] and have given us an understanding
[41:17] now if you have the new birth
[41:20] the Son of God Has Come
[41:22] to do what now to give us an
[41:25] understanding see and we know that the
[41:27] Son of God has come and hath given us an
[41:30] understanding
[41:32] that we may know him that is true and we
[41:36] are in him
[41:38] that is true even in his son Jesus
[41:41] Christ this is the true God
[41:45] and
[41:46] eternal life you may be seated the Lord
[41:48] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[41:50] word what is eternal life
[41:54] to know him
[41:56] to know him is eternal life and who is
[41:59] he
[42:00] and he's the word right so then to know
[42:04] the word not letter not quotes
[42:08] you know the letters on a page that'll
[42:10] kill you but to know the revealed word
[42:14] is to know eternal life right
[42:19] because that's what we've been trying to
[42:21] to talk about we've been on
[42:22] predestination now for uh this is about
[42:25] tonight's message
[42:27] and uh we've been trying to get you to
[42:30] see a point
[42:32] that you know we want you to stay on and
[42:35] hold it that we see that
[42:38] predestination
[42:40] is what people say is a bad word but
[42:44] it's it's not a bad word
[42:47] it's our understanding of it right it's
[42:50] what we make it a bad word the word
[42:52] itself is okay but you know what's what
[42:55] our understanding and our understanding
[42:58] of predestination has always been based
[43:01] on not everything is really on the Bible
[43:03] is based upon our previous
[43:06] understanding right all right now if
[43:09] we've been taught the truth come on then
[43:12] you know we can can uh uh you know
[43:17] we can have it understand it but if
[43:20] we've been taught era right
[43:23] see there's no way ever to come in error
[43:26] listen to what I'm saying now you can't
[43:28] come in error to the truth right there's
[43:31] no way era can bring it to the truth
[43:33] right right
[43:35] it can't do it it can't bring you to it
[43:38] it takes the truth to bring the truth
[43:40] all right now you know to find out we're
[43:43] an error to get rid of it yeah that's a
[43:46] good point because that's what we need
[43:47] but error will never bring truth
[43:50] you have to see truth and then error
[43:55] automatically will unfold when you see
[43:58] one true and living God see then you can
[44:01] see that the white horse rider would
[44:03] have to be the Antichrist Etc or
[44:05] whatever because it would be something
[44:07] in opposition
[44:09] and you know in that then that's why
[44:12] we've stressed that the prophet says
[44:14] that there's not too many uh genuine new
[44:17] births one because the word is not
[44:20] taught correctly all right then when the
[44:23] word is not taught correctly then what
[44:25] are you going to get
[44:27] you're definitely not going to get you
[44:29] know genuine verse out of it it just
[44:31] won't work so you you know you have to
[44:34] uh uh try to find the truth because you
[44:38] shall find us and know the truth and the
[44:40] truth shall set you free all right but
[44:42] what is predestination the prophet of
[44:44] God said you know that
[44:47] predestination looks back to
[44:49] foreknowledge
[44:51] all right
[44:53] or it looks back to election that's the
[44:55] two different points that he uses all
[44:58] right now so that means for knowledge is
[45:01] first
[45:04] if predestination looks back to
[45:06] foreknowledge then that means that for
[45:09] knowledge was in existence
[45:12] before the predestination
[45:15] all right and it means then that what is
[45:17] predestinated to be
[45:21] is because of the foreknowledge
[45:24] they you know that then should be a
[45:28] sensible uh understanding let alone a
[45:31] spiritual Revelation that would just be
[45:34] into our hearts to see that God then
[45:36] would not predestinate according to his
[45:39] desires
[45:40] but he would really predestinate
[45:42] according to your desires amen see he
[45:45] would predetermine it because of your
[45:47] desires and your thoughts and he's the
[45:50] prophet said if you wanted salvation
[45:51] then God would have it ready for you
[45:53] when you got here all right see now ever
[45:56] and then you get into that then then you
[45:58] can just keep going
[46:01] but we spent time on that laying that
[46:04] Foundation to not get away from that now
[46:07] and then we started moving a little bit
[46:10] now into going back
[46:13] into the the you know into God and his
[46:17] ways and and uh as I tried to tell you
[46:20] for over and over and over we saw oh we
[46:23] were just in the mind of God well that's
[46:25] wonderful that's a good quote that's all
[46:27] right
[46:28] but remember Judas was in the mind of
[46:31] God
[46:32] I mean at the same time he saw uh Jesus
[46:37] coming on Earth
[46:38] Me by his for knowledge abilities he
[46:42] would also know that Judas this carrot
[46:45] would be there
[46:47] all right and they would both be from a
[46:50] thought in his mind
[46:51] but remember now that Jesus would be
[46:54] predestinated eternally
[46:58] and Judas would be predestinated to go
[47:01] to destruction
[47:03] all right so then God would have to have
[47:05] a way that he could do that
[47:08] and so he does it by foreknowledge
[47:11] you know these foreknowledge allowed him
[47:13] to understand
[47:15] got to have her brother back there with
[47:17] us good
[47:18] see we always say you're a visitor one
[47:20] time and two times you're just a part of
[47:22] us so make yourself comfortable
[47:24] no so then predestination is not hard if
[47:29] we follow it correctly
[47:31] we try to make it to be what we have
[47:34] been taught as I said all of our lives
[47:36] right and in doing that see then we come
[47:40] down to a conclusion
[47:42] that
[47:45] it is not as the prophet said the person
[47:50] everything in the world if if God if I
[47:54] always say that to us let you you're the
[47:56] question not me if there is a God
[48:00] he said well you're saying therefore is
[48:01] when you're down there no I'm not
[48:03] doubting them that's in your your point
[48:05] that's to you you're the one that's
[48:07] saying it not me all right if there is a
[48:10] God and he can't keep things straight
[48:11] and run it right then one worship him I
[48:15] mean let's get us a totem pole and have
[48:16] a good time and forget the whole thing
[48:18] you know yeah
[48:20] but if there is a God
[48:22] then if that God doesn't know the very
[48:25] beginning and the ending
[48:28] then
[48:30] what kind of a God are you serving well
[48:33] in a way I guess you know
[48:36] in a way you know that uh maybe he knows
[48:41] a little bit well that means you know
[48:44] more than he does
[48:45] yes
[48:47] no that's the reason I like talk fun
[48:50] you know blunt
[48:52] see if you think that God doesn't know
[48:54] everything then you think you know more
[48:56] than he does
[48:58] well see that puts you in a bad position
[49:01] but anyhow
[49:02] I mean then we get into looking at as I
[49:06] said about for knowledge
[49:08] and then how would God
[49:10] predetermine things to be
[49:13] is because he could look down and see
[49:17] the Bible says Jesus Christ is a lamb
[49:21] slain Revelation 18 13 8. then he stood
[49:25] as a lamb slain before the foundation of
[49:28] the world
[49:29] all right
[49:30] so then if he stood as a lamb slain
[49:32] before the foundation of the world
[49:35] we know that wasn't a physical happening
[49:38] right
[49:41] because some 2000 years ago then there
[49:45] was a physical happening that Jesus
[49:48] Christ had to die on the cross if it was
[49:50] physical back dire there was no reason
[49:52] for him to come down here and die again
[49:56] so that's not real but they're in the
[49:59] physical that was in the mind of God so
[50:02] then he could look down and he could
[50:04] write her name down or leave her name
[50:05] out
[50:06] because of our choice
[50:09] that's what I said there and I've tried
[50:10] to make the point over and over to you
[50:12] see the reason people don't want to
[50:15] believe in foreknowledge they're afraid
[50:16] of it
[50:19] they're afraid of four knowledge
[50:21] they want to be some great big spiritual
[50:24] thing about oh I just believe you know
[50:27] like who was it the old guy you know
[50:30] stick his hand in you know Napoleon walk
[50:31] around and they just want to believe
[50:34] that all oh yeah
[50:36] I've resisted
[50:37] sister
[50:39] you know what does that do any good
[50:44] but you see
[50:45] then you start saying yes but now God
[50:48] predestinated according to what you
[50:50] desire
[50:54] all right now here's the one side then
[50:57] I see people don't want that because
[50:59] they know it's based on what they do
[51:01] you say now salvation brother the hell
[51:04] is not based on what I did I didn't say
[51:06] anything about that that's right
[51:09] that's right but what we do and don't do
[51:12] has got a lot to do with it
[51:15] but we don't go out and live like the
[51:16] devil don't want to die like Paul
[51:19] me so then what we do is
[51:22] is we wind up making the Bible false
[51:25] prophecy by taking our own conceived
[51:29] idea
[51:31] I'm saying this is what it is then we
[51:33] turn around we take the message of the
[51:35] hour that we believe that God sent us a
[51:38] message and then we've come to that
[51:39] basis and we we want to make it line up
[51:42] where we want it to line up
[51:44] to be able to see it so people's afraid
[51:47] of foreknowledge
[51:49] because you're sitting there right now
[51:51] thinking something
[51:53] all right because it's impossible for
[51:55] the human mind not to think
[51:57] right all right so you're thinking you
[52:00] know that God knows that thought yeah
[52:02] that's right and he not only knows the
[52:05] thought he knows why you had to talk
[52:08] and he's going to know the next thoughts
[52:10] you have about the thought right
[52:14] now if he doesn't he's not God all right
[52:17] so then what you have to do is you have
[52:20] to to bring it to a basis of where you
[52:22] say wait just a minute now
[52:27] God knew I was going to be saved
[52:31] to have everything ready for me the only
[52:34] thing I can do is accept it
[52:39] all right now me accepting him is one
[52:42] thing
[52:44] amen but him accepting us is another
[52:47] thing amen
[52:49] now him accepting us is based upon a
[52:52] higher level
[52:55] or reasoning or some you know reason for
[52:58] it to be done
[53:00] and uh then that way we want to go into
[53:04] that point
[53:05] to see that and like I said now if we
[53:09] just deal with being in the mind of God
[53:11] whether than Judas this guy it was in
[53:13] the mind of God
[53:15] that's right the at the same time Peter
[53:18] James Johnson and all of them was upon
[53:19] the Earth Judas was right there and in
[53:22] the mind of God he knew exactly what
[53:24] they would do he knew exactly what Judas
[53:26] would do
[53:27] all right see then the thing formed the
[53:30] scripture says can't say why did you
[53:33] form me this way
[53:37] because God never made us wrong
[53:39] that's right
[53:41] right like I'm trying to tell you all
[53:44] even into the Fallen condition
[53:48] God gave you a perfect soul
[53:52] I didn't say eternal
[53:55] a lot of difference in the word
[53:58] but how could God give you an imperfect
[54:00] Soul well it's God's fault because of my
[54:03] problem here now you're talking about
[54:04] the flesh but still it doesn't make no
[54:07] difference because
[54:08] the a baby is as perfect as it can be
[54:11] when it's born unless there's something
[54:13] wrong physically
[54:15] in the body
[54:18] so then God gives you a perfect Soul a
[54:21] perfect spirit
[54:23] and he does the best he can and that's
[54:25] putting the distance blank that just
[54:27] blank as I can make it under the
[54:29] condition we exist in he's done as good
[54:31] as he could do about bringing us into
[54:33] the world
[54:34] hmm but see then what we do after then
[54:40] is what salvation is based upon because
[54:43] if you won't accept it
[54:46] well if I'm predestinated I'll be there
[54:48] all right the predestination is whether
[54:51] or not you accept it
[54:53] because he could predetermine but now as
[54:56] I started saying a moment ago then
[54:58] according to about 154 churches book
[55:01] it's not the person
[55:03] you know but you're looking at the the
[55:05] people we're looking at
[55:09] from God
[55:11] it's the seed our word
[55:14] that's right all right
[55:15] now so then that cedar word can be
[55:18] predestinated
[55:21] and it will take place
[55:25] but see in doing that then
[55:28] if you believe in it that he would
[55:30] predestinate the word
[55:33] like we'd say forever Age The Prophet
[55:35] would say it
[55:37] they would be a word
[55:40] and God before the world predestinated
[55:43] it and he knew where that would be
[55:45] director
[55:46] so when Martin Luther walked out there
[55:48] to preach the message to the just shall
[55:50] live by faith
[55:52] that was
[55:53] that justification
[55:56] was the predestinated seed all right
[55:59] now Luther the flesh was predestinated
[56:04] by foreknowledge of what would come upon
[56:07] the Earth
[56:08] and all of his trinitary and Doctrine
[56:11] they had
[56:14] and believing I think he would neither
[56:16] one that said the Jews were to be taken
[56:18] out and killed was Martin Luther you see
[56:20] because he didn't understand
[56:22] what
[56:24] the that part wasn't predestinated
[56:27] eternally
[56:29] it was that word for that day but it
[56:32] would have to be somebody on Earth to
[56:34] take that word and preach that word to
[56:37] bring It Forward all right so then that
[56:40] would be the word would be predestinated
[56:42] eternally
[56:43] thank God for giving us the word
[56:47] that we can believe it
[56:48] because they're deceived forever ages
[56:50] you live in see then nobody can take
[56:52] your place
[56:53] but God's waiting on you and I to
[56:55] realize it
[56:58] well I've always believed
[56:59] presidentialize the word well how do you
[57:00] believe it
[57:02] well I believe I come into this world
[57:04] with eternal life that's the way some of
[57:06] the people of the message never believe
[57:08] well that's their belief that's nothing
[57:10] to do with me and you I'm not going to
[57:12] argue with them about it that's their
[57:13] business
[57:14] you can believe what you want to you can
[57:16] believe you're a big toes God but I
[57:18] always tell you don't stick it up for me
[57:19] to kiss it cause I'm not going to do it
[57:21] I might hit it with a hammer
[57:23] because I'm just not going to play
[57:24] around no
[57:27] all right but as far as what you believe
[57:29] you believe what you want to
[57:31] I've never tried to convince nobody
[57:33] of what I believe I try to preach the
[57:36] gospel
[57:37] and unless you make up your own mind all
[57:39] right you see then I believe before you
[57:43] can have eternal life
[57:46] that you must receive eternal life
[57:48] that's what I'm trying to get over
[57:49] Wednesday that night there you know and
[57:50] and everything and I've had these notes
[57:53] so you forgive me when we get over at a
[57:55] while and you got x's on them because
[57:56] I've had these notes for a while and
[57:59] then Joe's having a joke on them backers
[58:01] and forth for them to be able to get
[58:02] them on the internet but
[58:05] still what I want you to think about
[58:08] today is
[58:10] did you come with eternal life
[58:15] that's the way some people believe
[58:19] wouldn't that be a wonderful thing
[58:22] if it was true
[58:25] but I don't believe it
[58:27] would that be a wonderful situation
[58:31] you think about it
[58:34] you wouldn't have to worry about a thing
[58:36] that's right
[58:38] you just live like you wanted to
[58:41] and then you're going to help me anyway
[58:45] because we're eternal
[58:49] because I don't believe it I believe you
[58:52] must be born again that's right I
[58:54] believe you must receive eternal life
[58:57] as the prophet of God said even your
[59:00] little Virgin Mary that you call the
[59:02] mother of God said she had to go to the
[59:05] upper room to receive the baptism of the
[59:07] Holy Ghost well I believe that anybody
[59:10] would have had any right to us to have
[59:12] hollered and screamed about
[59:15] eternity it was probably her that's
[59:17] right because she was a carrier
[59:19] of almighty God
[59:21] but a carrier didn't make her
[59:25] to the bases that she had eternal life
[59:28] she still had to receive it right that's
[59:30] right all right now somebody tell you
[59:33] you don't have to receive eternal life
[59:35] you just tell them say well I'm sorry I
[59:37] don't believe you cut away that's right
[59:39] ain't no need to argue with because you
[59:41] ain't gonna do no good
[59:43] because they got quotes
[59:45] Let's see we had quotes from raising the
[59:48] Baptists because I could quote to you
[59:50] and prove to you that there was one God
[59:51] when I was in the Baptist Church
[59:54] because the Baptist Doctrine is one God
[59:56] but then the way we explained it was God
[59:59] in three persons Blessed Trinity
[1:00:01] coincarnal
[1:00:04] till then
[1:00:06] you can see we really didn't have it
[1:00:08] right we just had words
[1:00:11] you know words
[1:00:14] will kill you all right
[1:00:16] but you say but I came to the world with
[1:00:18] eternal life let's read some of those
[1:00:20] things
[1:00:21] if your Prophet had to say about it and
[1:00:24] I don't mind reading them when he said
[1:00:26] something
[1:00:27] you know I love to read it because I
[1:00:30] believe it'll all come together and do
[1:00:32] it now I've been trying to get these
[1:00:34] notes done for three sermons now so all
[1:00:37] right you know and uh so you just
[1:00:40] forgive it you that are visitors you you
[1:00:43] try to bear with us because you know if
[1:00:45] I do it in another sermon I'm going to
[1:00:47] be waiting four sermons to be able to
[1:00:48] say what I'm trying to say so I'm going
[1:00:52] to just go ahead and try to do it and
[1:00:53] then if you don't understand me you talk
[1:00:55] to me I have a service about it because
[1:00:57] I believe
[1:00:59] that you must have
[1:01:01] you must receive eternal life right
[1:01:04] that's right now we'll get to it in a
[1:01:07] minute so we'll we'll run around and
[1:01:09] said we always was eternal all right
[1:01:11] that's a direct quote
[1:01:15] Jesus told
[1:01:16] the people said
[1:01:18] you know the disciples said search the
[1:01:21] scriptures that's it right there
[1:01:25] instead of in them
[1:01:28] you think right
[1:01:31] you have eternal life right amen
[1:01:36] now that's what Jesus said
[1:01:38] yeah and I believe that's what brother
[1:01:40] Bradford was saying
[1:01:43] search the rest of the message
[1:01:46] you think you have eternal life
[1:01:49] you know what as far as God was
[1:01:52] concerned
[1:01:56] if we believe that Jesus Christ stood as
[1:01:59] a lamb slain according to revelation
[1:02:01] 13 8. if we believe that then in God's
[1:02:06] mind as far as God was concerned then
[1:02:10] anyone that would ever receive eternal
[1:02:13] life
[1:02:17] in his mind they had it then
[1:02:21] is that true Amen in his mind right
[1:02:27] but remember now his mind would be
[1:02:31] dealing with looking down through
[1:02:34] and coming back to his foreknowledge
[1:02:37] that's right and that's how he would
[1:02:39] predetermine
[1:02:41] and I've always told you
[1:02:45] see people say I if I just thought
[1:02:50] I don't want to be a thought in God's
[1:02:51] mind
[1:02:52] I'm just as honest as I can be
[1:02:55] I want to be a part of the one that done
[1:02:57] the thinking
[1:03:00] because that way of giving me eternal
[1:03:01] life
[1:03:02] if I'm a thought of in God's mind you
[1:03:05] can see me that I'd be dying going to
[1:03:07] hell
[1:03:08] so I don't want to be a thought in God's
[1:03:10] mind
[1:03:11] he said well that's just a carna we're
[1:03:12] putting it well it may be but that's the
[1:03:14] way I believe it
[1:03:15] I want to be a part of the very one that
[1:03:18] done the thinking then I don't have to
[1:03:21] worry about it right right
[1:03:23] I've got everything under control you
[1:03:26] know as long as if he's in command no
[1:03:31] but you see as far as God is concerned
[1:03:36] because I said every person that would
[1:03:37] ever receive eternal life
[1:03:41] before the world he could he would
[1:03:43] believe that they had eternal life
[1:03:48] now here's our point that we've been
[1:03:51] trying to get
[1:03:53] I gave you a few quotes back on it to
[1:03:55] show you you can go down through there
[1:03:57] and read them as you as I'm talking
[1:04:00] we talk about eternal life
[1:04:04] what is your thoughts of eternal life
[1:04:08] like I said we take it and we say and
[1:04:11] read Around used it
[1:04:13] and it's a good illustration
[1:04:16] that eternity's like a circle
[1:04:19] which means it has no beginning and no
[1:04:22] end
[1:04:23] well in mathematicians you would know
[1:04:26] what I'm saying take the circle and Tool
[1:04:29] it like this and what have you got
[1:04:32] you see my hands turn one's going one
[1:04:35] way one's going the other grab the sides
[1:04:38] of the of the thing and twist it you've
[1:04:41] got the Signet or sign of what they call
[1:04:44] the infinite which is really not a
[1:04:46] circle right like this it goes up and
[1:04:51] down and back around and up and down and
[1:04:53] back around that's the Signet of what
[1:04:55] you call Infinity all right but the
[1:04:59] point is good and wonderful
[1:05:03] about no beginning and no ending
[1:05:07] but I tried to get you to see a point
[1:05:10] and I keep making it over and over
[1:05:14] it's easy for us to look at eternity is
[1:05:17] going that way
[1:05:23] and I believe it
[1:05:25] and I believe after this world is over
[1:05:27] with
[1:05:28] I believe we're going to preached to you
[1:05:30] for 40 years about it
[1:05:32] that we're just getting enough
[1:05:34] understanding here by the new birth and
[1:05:37] all of our great mentality we have we're
[1:05:40] just getting enough ability to be able
[1:05:42] to comprehend when we Step Beyond the
[1:05:44] curtain's time
[1:05:46] do whatever you want to call your happy
[1:05:48] hunting ground or whatever you want to
[1:05:50] call it or Heaven
[1:05:52] we're just getting enough the prophet
[1:05:53] said we get a message of tear down to
[1:05:56] the endless ages
[1:05:58] now how can you take an eternal word
[1:06:05] which would mean that word never had a
[1:06:07] beginning
[1:06:09] and it can never have an ending
[1:06:12] how can you comprehend that with the
[1:06:14] human mind
[1:06:17] but it said we make it a circle but my
[1:06:20] point is
[1:06:22] we can go that way looking
[1:06:25] at eternity
[1:06:27] and talk about a great time of coming to
[1:06:30] a position in eternity and that's
[1:06:31] wonderful
[1:06:32] but now if we believe that eternity had
[1:06:35] no beginning and no ending we ought to
[1:06:38] be able to go just as far that away
[1:06:43] going to be able to look back
[1:06:46] through time until time becomes
[1:06:49] non-existent
[1:06:51] and we can step back into the great
[1:06:54] eternities just as far that away as we
[1:06:57] can go that way amen all right now the
[1:07:01] prophet would say in the beginning
[1:07:04] before the eternal
[1:07:07] Now where's the human mind can
[1:07:09] comprehend that right that's right we
[1:07:12] might as well forget it you can't
[1:07:13] comprehend what he's saying
[1:07:15] he's just simply explaining eternity
[1:07:17] right all right so now there's no
[1:07:20] beginning there's no ending
[1:07:24] all right
[1:07:25] that's why we don't believe
[1:07:30] in an eternal sonship
[1:07:36] see because the sun has a beginning
[1:07:43] that body that Jesus we call Jesus
[1:07:46] dwelling upon the Earth two thousand
[1:07:48] years ago that body had a beginning
[1:07:53] and that body had to be one day made
[1:07:56] Eternal right in the resurrection
[1:07:58] Ascension Etc
[1:08:01] all right
[1:08:03] you see it went from a time element
[1:08:08] to Eternal position
[1:08:11] all right and I don't understand why we
[1:08:13] can't see that our soul
[1:08:16] come into the world lost and doomed and
[1:08:19] on the way to hell
[1:08:21] born in sin shaping in an English past
[1:08:23] my mother's womb go forth a liar
[1:08:25] according to the psalmist David right
[1:08:27] and that's why I don't I don't
[1:08:29] understand if Jesus had to go through to
[1:08:31] that to be able to hit body be made
[1:08:33] eternal yeah
[1:08:35] I don't see why we can't comprehend
[1:08:38] that his body could receive eternal life
[1:08:43] why is it we can't understand that our
[1:08:47] moral part of us which is all of us Body
[1:08:50] Spirit and soul
[1:08:54] why we can't receive eternal life
[1:08:57] you know one day the body you're looking
[1:08:59] at here will be made Eternal we don't
[1:09:01] believe in getting a new body that's an
[1:09:03] old denominational Doctrine right Jesus
[1:09:06] raised with nail prints in his hand
[1:09:07] showing that that won't work now you
[1:09:10] don't need to arguing with nobody he
[1:09:11] just raised when they'll press in his
[1:09:12] hand right but yeah we've been taught by
[1:09:16] Mom and Daddy uncle and Sudi and and all
[1:09:19] down through time
[1:09:21] that we're gonna get us a new body you
[1:09:23] know what they're doing still doing the
[1:09:24] message now they're still preaching
[1:09:27] we're gonna get a new body we're going
[1:09:28] to walk out one of these days on our own
[1:09:30] ashes in the Millennium then we're going
[1:09:33] to walk around in some kind of a form or
[1:09:35] something and then we're going to walk
[1:09:36] back and at some way that's going to
[1:09:39] come come back or something I listened
[1:09:41] to him I couldn't understand it
[1:09:43] but that's their business we we're here
[1:09:46] right but do you see that eternal life
[1:09:49] has no beginning right and we don't
[1:09:52] believe in Eternal sonship see that's
[1:09:54] why I said the the denomination teaching
[1:09:57] uh you know God is three persons Blessed
[1:09:59] Trinity co-worko eternal
[1:10:02] now how could see that Doctrine they
[1:10:05] believe each one of the three
[1:10:08] and then they'll say oh no it's not
[1:10:09] three it's just one but yet they make
[1:10:12] three personalities
[1:10:15] and they make them co-equal
[1:10:17] and co-eternal yeah yeah well if if
[1:10:21] words is words co-equal means co-equal
[1:10:24] go equal means identical same substance
[1:10:27] so what kind of a theory have you got
[1:10:32] but see we believe in God being made
[1:10:34] manifest
[1:10:37] the Eternal God condescending from Glory
[1:10:41] down to where we are and in doing that
[1:10:44] he took upon himself human flesh
[1:10:48] he could dwell here as melchized he
[1:10:51] could dwell into the Old Testament at
[1:10:53] the pillar of fire the angel of the
[1:10:54] Covenant all that was wonderful
[1:10:57] but one day he stepped in the flesh to
[1:11:00] show us what we had to do
[1:11:02] that he had eternal life because he was
[1:11:05] God
[1:11:06] he didn't become God as they're saying
[1:11:09] now on the River Jordan that's
[1:11:11] they're Doctrine did he become god well
[1:11:14] no you got a problem
[1:11:17] he
[1:11:18] he was God Almighty or you got a
[1:11:21] trinitarian concept
[1:11:25] you got to do this
[1:11:26] more than anything else but that's
[1:11:29] that's other people's business I try to
[1:11:31] preach the gospel
[1:11:32] I believe almighty God came down in
[1:11:35] human flesh to fulfill the Bible
[1:11:39] and then him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:11:41] godhead bodily
[1:11:44] he said I come from God I go to God
[1:11:48] he said if you've seen me you've seen
[1:11:51] the father
[1:11:52] all right all of that
[1:11:56] to show who he was
[1:11:59] show us the father they said Jesus said
[1:12:02] have I been so long waiting you didn't
[1:12:03] see me if you see me you saved the
[1:12:05] father right
[1:12:07] but they couldn't comprehend that
[1:12:11] but if he had to come into the world and
[1:12:14] then had to receive eternal life into
[1:12:16] that body why can't we see that we come
[1:12:19] into the world lost and his purpose for
[1:12:21] dying was to save us
[1:12:24] to where he couldn't part eternal life
[1:12:26] to you and I
[1:12:28] yes but I just believe Brother David I
[1:12:31] just believe what the prophet said when
[1:12:33] you're going to believe I almost said
[1:12:37] all right
[1:12:39] if eternity never begins
[1:12:44] and Eternity can never end
[1:12:49] so then Eternal sonship goes out
[1:12:52] but now we do believe in eternal godship
[1:12:56] sir amen
[1:13:00] all right so you believe in the Eternal
[1:13:02] godship that means God can come down and
[1:13:05] live with us the great Eternal can live
[1:13:08] right here with us
[1:13:10] and we can handle him as the Bible says
[1:13:14] all right
[1:13:16] but you know one day the Bible says
[1:13:17] we'll be lacking because you know we we
[1:13:19] will because we'll be like him right in
[1:13:22] other words we're going to keep
[1:13:23] advancing forward we receive eternal
[1:13:25] life by the new birth
[1:13:27] that doesn't make our body and spirit
[1:13:30] eternal
[1:13:31] neither did the eternal life dwelling in
[1:13:33] him make his body eternal
[1:13:37] he had to live for those 33 years as a
[1:13:41] human being in the outward realm amen
[1:13:44] right but then one day that body stepped
[1:13:48] into eternal life
[1:13:49] right we just keep walking in the word
[1:13:53] and one day we'll step into eternal life
[1:13:56] that's Body Spirit and soul
[1:13:58] man all right so your denomination said
[1:14:01] we got to get a new body because they
[1:14:02] don't believe God can can redeem this
[1:14:04] and if he can make it I don't think he
[1:14:06] got no problem about redeeming it
[1:14:09] yeah but now Brother David he made me
[1:14:11] like it no he didn't make you like that
[1:14:17] he did not make you the way we You Were
[1:14:20] Me The Way We Are we volunteered for it
[1:14:23] when we become of age of accountability
[1:14:27] he paid the price we didn't have to do
[1:14:29] it we put ourselves in the pawn shop of
[1:14:33] life right we blame God for doing it or
[1:14:37] at least try to blame the devil for
[1:14:39] doing it ain't gonna blame you need one
[1:14:40] we've done it ourselves
[1:14:42] we put ourselves into the world of lost
[1:14:44] condition
[1:14:47] God was right there when we reached that
[1:14:49] age of accountability that's what
[1:14:51] accountability is
[1:14:53] accountability is the the ability to
[1:14:56] give an account is that what
[1:14:57] accountability is
[1:14:59] in other words you reach to a place that
[1:15:01] you're responsible
[1:15:04] we'll see if we hit right at that point
[1:15:06] had we realized we're responsible for
[1:15:09] what we're doing and we stopped right
[1:15:11] there and said God save me that's right
[1:15:16] but what would have happened right
[1:15:20] but we didn't do it did we
[1:15:23] know all right
[1:15:24] so think about what he's saying look
[1:15:26] down at number four you know it's
[1:15:28] because I don't want to read these notes
[1:15:29] as much if these have been before you
[1:15:31] before
[1:15:32] but look at the one down where it says
[1:15:33] E6 of have not I sent D
[1:15:37] 1962 uh 124.
[1:15:40] eternity never begins never ends see
[1:15:43] never had a beginning this is our
[1:15:46] brother back there I have a copy
[1:15:47] somebody to make sure he's got a copy of
[1:15:49] how do we believe right around him was a
[1:15:51] prophet and we believe that you know I
[1:15:54] don't know who you are and how you
[1:15:56] believe but we believe that God sent a
[1:15:59] prophet in the last days and I sure like
[1:16:00] to read about what he said we don't
[1:16:02] believe that Prophet to be God
[1:16:04] no don't believe nothing about it being
[1:16:06] God but God used the man to bring a
[1:16:09] message
[1:16:10] and if you're a Baptist then God used
[1:16:12] John Smith to bring you a message if
[1:16:15] you're a Methodist do you use your I
[1:16:16] mean yeah you use John Wesley to bring
[1:16:18] you a message if you're a Lutheran the
[1:16:20] youth Martin Luther to bring your
[1:16:22] message so whatever Church you're from
[1:16:24] you got somebody back there that was
[1:16:26] doing it and Paul said follow me as I
[1:16:29] follow Christ all right
[1:16:32] that's right do you say I'm not gonna
[1:16:35] follow no man
[1:16:36] who are you following
[1:16:38] you walk around and look and you'll find
[1:16:41] out
[1:16:42] you call me her a certain way you walk a
[1:16:45] certain ways because somebody ahead of
[1:16:46] you you liked it that way
[1:16:49] right my brother-in-law got his arm
[1:16:52] blowed off years ago right in here and
[1:16:55] he would you know he didn't have a hand
[1:16:57] to clap with
[1:16:59] so if you've done anything he doesn't
[1:17:01] know if you know and he hit his hand
[1:17:03] well you know his little grandson you
[1:17:05] know that little grandson he didn't clap
[1:17:07] like this
[1:17:12] thank you
[1:17:13] because that's what he's saying so just
[1:17:15] remember that all right now look what he
[1:17:17] said he turned it he never begins never
[1:17:19] ends see never had a beginning never had
[1:17:22] an ending you can't explain it but
[1:17:25] anything that had a beginning has an end
[1:17:27] now watch
[1:17:29] so you say What About Us brother Branham
[1:17:34] well as long as your natural human
[1:17:38] off the Earth here
[1:17:41] you had a beginning
[1:17:44] now everybody knows because if I'm
[1:17:47] standing up here today and I said well
[1:17:49] I'll tell you what I'm going to do
[1:17:51] I'm gonna pull a hat I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:17:54] pick a day in the year and I'm gonna
[1:17:56] pull a number out of that hat and I'm
[1:17:58] gonna give the one that says they were
[1:18:00] born on that day I'm gonna give them a
[1:18:02] hundred dollar bill
[1:18:03] well if I pulled your pulled out to your
[1:18:05] birthday you jump up and run up here
[1:18:07] wouldn't you
[1:18:09] do you understand what I'm saying you
[1:18:12] realize you
[1:18:16] you know your body wasn't eternal right
[1:18:18] right it's not now
[1:18:21] if he did but I'll tell you what I'd
[1:18:23] hate to stay here like this if this is
[1:18:25] heaven Forgive Me Lord
[1:18:28] you know yes because I'm a human
[1:18:32] see as long as you're a natural human of
[1:18:34] the earth you had a beginning
[1:18:36] but if you're born to heaven
[1:18:41] you're part of God
[1:18:43] and that Spirit never had a beginning
[1:18:45] because it's part of God it's Eternal
[1:18:48] that's the only way you can ever live
[1:18:50] forever is to have eternal life that's
[1:18:53] right
[1:18:54] and eternal life but anything that has
[1:18:57] begins has an end
[1:19:00] all right
[1:19:01] now
[1:19:05] if anything happened beginning
[1:19:09] if you can't go
[1:19:12] with your understanding of
[1:19:14] predestination or existences or whatever
[1:19:18] but if you can't go all the way back
[1:19:23] and tie that
[1:19:27] and be just as Eternal as God is
[1:19:33] then you've missed it
[1:19:35] now here's our concept that we've had
[1:19:39] and it's all right
[1:19:42] Jesus was God manifested in flesh
[1:19:46] called a son right
[1:19:51] right
[1:19:53] he called a son
[1:19:55] now that word that come out of God in
[1:19:58] the beginning the logos is called a son
[1:20:00] of God
[1:20:02] that's why the trinitariancy believe in
[1:20:04] it's a
[1:20:05] Eternal sonship when there's no such
[1:20:07] thing as Eternal censorship there's
[1:20:09] Eternal God but not eternal sonship
[1:20:11] all right
[1:20:12] now do you believe the new birth makes
[1:20:14] you a son of God
[1:20:17] okay now how do you believe that
[1:20:24] if he was the son of God
[1:20:27] and had no beginning
[1:20:30] he was only just called a son
[1:20:34] to eternal life
[1:20:38] doesn't make you a son of God
[1:20:43] it makes you eternal
[1:20:46] God
[1:20:48] now you're going too far brother Dale
[1:20:51] no we just think never went far enough
[1:20:53] yet
[1:20:54] we're not getting it you explain it to
[1:20:56] me
[1:20:57] the new birth
[1:20:59] May son Oh you mean you won't admit that
[1:21:03] that's what it is you will say it from
[1:21:05] your lips
[1:21:07] and make many Eternal son or daughter
[1:21:09] how could it make you an eternal son or
[1:21:10] daughter
[1:21:12] it can make you God manifest
[1:21:14] right
[1:21:17] in another form
[1:21:19] called son
[1:21:21] that's what he was he was God manifested
[1:21:24] in a form called a son amen we are his
[1:21:28] offspring yes sir
[1:21:33] we're his children right
[1:21:36] what do we believe so if you're born of
[1:21:40] heaven and that's what Jesus said to to
[1:21:43] Nicodemus when he said you must be born
[1:21:44] again
[1:21:45] you go back to the original translation
[1:21:47] you'll find that says You must be born
[1:21:48] from above
[1:21:51] in other words Jesus was saying to
[1:21:53] Nicodemus you've got to be born from
[1:21:54] where I come from
[1:21:58] if you're not going from where I come
[1:21:59] from you don't have a new birth
[1:22:02] that was what he was saying
[1:22:04] he said you got to be born from the same
[1:22:06] place I came from
[1:22:07] where did he come from heaven
[1:22:10] so he must have a Heavenly bird
[1:22:13] all right
[1:22:14] no
[1:22:17] you keep those and stay with it now
[1:22:19] let's just get over here and read a
[1:22:20] little bit
[1:22:22] look at number nine on your notes
[1:22:30] this is the one everybody likes to use
[1:22:34] okay
[1:22:36] and I believe exactly what he's saying
[1:22:38] future home page 34 1964 802.
[1:22:42] there's your holy convocation not have
[1:22:45] anything to do with the literal thing
[1:22:47] it's beyond that it's into the kingdom
[1:22:50] of God with eternal life
[1:22:53] with the predestinated that never did
[1:22:56] start
[1:22:57] it never started on any day this
[1:23:01] you wasn't saved on any day
[1:23:07] you was always saved
[1:23:10] amen and Jesus came to redeem that but
[1:23:14] you were saved from the beginning
[1:23:15] because you had eternal life to begin
[1:23:18] with
[1:23:25] that sounds really
[1:23:28] what really shadow of that couldn't we
[1:23:31] yeah boy we don't have to worry about
[1:23:33] nothing do we like I said while ago we
[1:23:35] just feel like the devil and don't worry
[1:23:36] about it we always was eternal
[1:23:40] but what did Jesus Christ have to die
[1:23:42] for
[1:23:43] yes did he die to bring you an
[1:23:51] I'll ask you a simple question I left
[1:23:53] questions you know what
[1:23:55] they make you think
[1:23:58] see if it's like what most people think
[1:24:01] that we always was eternal then Jesus
[1:24:04] must have come into the world and done
[1:24:05] all he done and died to just let us know
[1:24:07] we always was eternal well what didn't
[1:24:10] why did he not tell that to Nicodemus
[1:24:15] and then go right on back up to heaven
[1:24:17] and not have to pay the price
[1:24:23] you sure put him through a whole lot by
[1:24:25] your thinking that
[1:24:26] I just come in the world eternal life
[1:24:28] that's what my pastor preaches well I'd
[1:24:32] find me another Pastor because that's
[1:24:33] what the prophet of God said he said you
[1:24:35] stay with your pastor as long as he
[1:24:36] stays the truth said he gets off the
[1:24:38] truth lead the pastor to find you
[1:24:39] another pastor and stays with the truth
[1:24:42] I stopped trying to brush churches or
[1:24:43] doing nothing I tell them what the
[1:24:45] prophet had to say about it
[1:24:47] I don't want you here if God don't send
[1:24:49] you because you've been hinterest to me
[1:24:52] and I'd be a hinders to you
[1:24:56] hey that's what I told my son-in-law
[1:24:58] when he was dating my daughter I said I
[1:25:00] want you to lose because you you're just
[1:25:02] moving there I said I want you there
[1:25:03] because of the word
[1:25:08] uh that's just I'm sorry that's just the
[1:25:11] way I am but while you're looking at
[1:25:13] that one see that's in the message
[1:25:14] future home let's go over to number 17
[1:25:18] on your notes get on over
[1:25:22] that's why I like to read all the
[1:25:24] prophets had to say
[1:25:27] like the prophet of God said one day he
[1:25:29] said I can show you one scripture said
[1:25:31] Judas went and hung yourself and give
[1:25:33] you another scripture that says you go
[1:25:34] do likewise now I told you two
[1:25:36] scriptures go hang yourself
[1:25:40] huh
[1:25:43] but that's not what the scripture says
[1:25:46] that's taking it out of text
[1:25:49] that's not saying what God Said
[1:25:52] you're making it say what you wanted to
[1:25:54] say
[1:25:56] look what he said here out of the same
[1:25:59] message that was page 34 that we just
[1:26:02] read
[1:26:04] now here on page 37 in the same message
[1:26:07] he says
[1:26:08] now you say well look at this priest
[1:26:12] wasn't he a son of God
[1:26:15] he proved he wasn't
[1:26:16] he couldn't recognize what now you know
[1:26:18] he's talking about the priests they they
[1:26:20] made in Belgium
[1:26:23] did he say I believe the Bible
[1:26:26] was sure he couldn't recognize the
[1:26:28] expressed word of the hour
[1:26:30] he only had an intellectual learning
[1:26:33] from some group that's been back
[1:26:36] before him
[1:26:38] and it's the same thing today
[1:26:40] see I know that's strong but it's the
[1:26:42] truth
[1:26:43] that was the word as spoken exactly for
[1:26:46] what day
[1:26:47] and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a
[1:26:50] renowned person but he could not have
[1:26:53] representation of predestination
[1:26:57] she only had the predestination he see
[1:27:01] only the predestinated will only be the
[1:27:04] one that does it
[1:27:07] only can be
[1:27:09] and you only can do it because look it
[1:27:11] proves predestination
[1:27:14] because if you've got eternal life
[1:27:20] you had to be a part of God all the time
[1:27:22] because he's the only one that's eternal
[1:27:26] now
[1:27:29] them little words right there
[1:27:32] there's a question there we got in the
[1:27:34] message of one time it looks like we
[1:27:35] just all Eternal everything's Eternal we
[1:27:37] come in the world eternal life we don't
[1:27:39] have to worry about nothing don't have
[1:27:40] to be saved don't have to do a thing
[1:27:43] no we're just eternal
[1:27:47] but then he asked the question
[1:27:51] or makes a statement that's really not a
[1:27:53] question
[1:27:56] if you have eternal life
[1:28:02] you were a part of God in the beginning
[1:28:05] now he's definitely not talking about
[1:28:07] her body is he that's right he's
[1:28:09] definitely not talking about our spirit
[1:28:10] and our soul of our natural human mortal
[1:28:13] or mortality
[1:28:15] immortal
[1:28:18] you're not talking about that
[1:28:22] but being a part of God
[1:28:25] as I said when Jesus spoke to the
[1:28:27] disciples one day
[1:28:29] he said it's I and you
[1:28:32] that's easy to understand isn't it
[1:28:35] he come down give his own life come live
[1:28:37] in us but read the rest of that sentence
[1:28:41] you and me
[1:28:45] I and you you and me
[1:28:48] it's easy to understand that we received
[1:28:50] a new birth he can
[1:28:59] we talk about as I said eternal life
[1:29:04] if you've got eternal life today
[1:29:07] the eternal life you have always was
[1:29:10] eternal
[1:29:12] not you
[1:29:14] man and it didn't make you eternal
[1:29:18] until you received it
[1:29:21] well that's that's making the beginning
[1:29:23] no it's not that ain't making it a
[1:29:25] beginning that's making exactly what it
[1:29:27] is
[1:29:29] if you have eternal life
[1:29:32] that eternal life that you have never
[1:29:35] had a beginning right
[1:29:39] you know you go along through life
[1:29:42] and a lot of people you know you
[1:29:44] more than the family and
[1:29:47] one day comes on somebody comes along to
[1:29:49] you and say hey you realize you wouldn't
[1:29:51] Dale
[1:29:53] and you realize they adopted you
[1:29:57] you said who am I
[1:30:01] so everybody start searching
[1:30:04] I haven't told you my concept on that of
[1:30:06] course my concept don't Mount the yellow
[1:30:07] beans but it is mine my concept is if
[1:30:11] I've been a Dale now for 70 years
[1:30:14] and somebody come along tell me that I'm
[1:30:16] not no Dale
[1:30:17] I was a McGillicuddy
[1:30:21] well I'm not going to go change my name
[1:30:23] to McGillicuddy now here's what's going
[1:30:26] to break your heart because you're to
[1:30:28] say I don't mean it but if I could find
[1:30:31] out I was a McGillicuddy and that made
[1:30:33] me heir to the throne of
[1:30:35] England
[1:30:39] I would never change my name to
[1:30:41] McGillicuddy
[1:30:44] because I'd be a hypocrite
[1:30:49] so you don't believe that away
[1:30:51] you think Money Changes thing now I've
[1:30:54] had the opportunity for money to change
[1:30:55] this man it ain't changed him yet
[1:30:58] I could be a multi-millionaire from what
[1:31:01] comes in this church
[1:31:03] but it don't go to my pocket
[1:31:08] that's just flat
[1:31:11] but you understand what I mean you mean
[1:31:12] my family would take me and they would
[1:31:15] raise me and feed me
[1:31:17] and then one day I found out that I
[1:31:19] wouldn't a Dale I want to know who my
[1:31:22] daddy is
[1:31:24] I know who my daddy is
[1:31:26] my daddy's once took care of me and fed
[1:31:29] me
[1:31:30] man that's just brother Dale's concept
[1:31:34] but that's I like it that way
[1:31:38] you see you say yeah you know you're
[1:31:40] giving the money and he changed well you
[1:31:43] go do what you want to
[1:31:45] see I'm a child of God and there ain't
[1:31:47] enough money in the world to talk me out
[1:31:49] of being a child of God giving the whole
[1:31:51] world the Bible said and I ain't gonna
[1:31:52] lose my soul and take it
[1:31:55] the devil offered to you so you didn't
[1:31:56] you're not as trapped if you're sitting
[1:31:58] in that
[1:31:59] you understand what I'm saying yes but I
[1:32:02] want to know who my daddy is why
[1:32:08] well I just never did feel like I was
[1:32:10] part of this family yeah cause you
[1:32:12] didn't like it cause you got a weapon
[1:32:16] your daddy raised you right
[1:32:19] you didn't like it
[1:32:21] that's blood takes one thing about it
[1:32:24] I never knew my doc my daddy in this
[1:32:27] world because I was four years old when
[1:32:28] he passed away but my mother but she
[1:32:31] could whip you good and you remembered
[1:32:34] all of them
[1:32:35] but you know when I got to be about 25
[1:32:37] years old I thanked her
[1:32:40] all right you know why because she said
[1:32:43] something in me that's kept me all of my
[1:32:45] life
[1:32:46] she said Son you look get in jail I'll
[1:32:49] come and look through the bars at you I
[1:32:52] knew she would
[1:32:54] none of you she's getting out because it
[1:32:56] was still her ways I told you about it I
[1:32:58] seen her take them the wooden ring off
[1:33:01] of a I mean a metal ring off of a wooden
[1:33:04] barrel in there about that much
[1:33:06] real heavy metal take it and pull it off
[1:33:08] of a barrel and hit my brother with it
[1:33:10] you call that child abuse he was 18
[1:33:12] years old

[1:33:17] not leaving mad go in the house until
[1:33:19] you calm down then you can leave he said
[1:33:22] I'm leaving she said you're not and she
[1:33:24] pulled it up
[1:33:25] you know why he never left home
[1:33:29] you see that's child abuse take it what
[1:33:32] you want to but he stayed there
[1:33:34] you know what he realized this mama
[1:33:37] loved him
[1:33:39] absolutely you children
[1:33:42] don't want to be corrected and things
[1:33:45] I hope you have enough time to live up
[1:33:47] we sit at the house one day and the boys
[1:33:50] retired I said boys you remember when I
[1:33:52] used to tell you that it hurt me anymore
[1:33:54] with y'all than it did for you to get
[1:33:56] the whipping and I said yep I said now
[1:33:59] you've got kids of your own you know
[1:34:00] what I'm talking about don't you they
[1:34:02] said yep
[1:34:04] all they had to do some whipping all
[1:34:07] right we'll get off of that
[1:34:09] trying to make a point but listen
[1:34:13] then I gave you all of these as I've
[1:34:16] been wanting to read
[1:34:20] and you take them home and you read them
[1:34:22] I hope you have
[1:34:23] I reprinted them to where you could do
[1:34:25] it
[1:34:27] and we won't go through it we'll just
[1:34:30] give the tape you want us give it for
[1:34:32] the tape
[1:34:35] but look how many times what your
[1:34:36] Prophet had to say 32 things that are to
[1:34:39] be 1965 1205.
[1:34:42] if you got eternal life
[1:34:45] then it always was eternal
[1:34:49] if you got it
[1:34:54] if you've got eternal life that's the
[1:34:57] title of the sermon if you got it
[1:34:59] that's not a question that's a statement
[1:35:02] if you have it
[1:35:05] um
[1:35:09] Revelation chapter 5 part 2 61 6 18.
[1:35:16] and you can't have eternal life unless
[1:35:18] you're saved you've got eternal life do
[1:35:20] you cannot burn in hell for Eternal
[1:35:23] you'll be punished for your sins with
[1:35:26] your natural life but you cannot have
[1:35:28] eternal life in hell if you've got
[1:35:30] eternal life then you cannot burn
[1:35:32] forever because there's only one form of
[1:35:35] eternal life
[1:35:40] identification 1964
[1:35:43] to 18 or 216.
[1:35:50] talking about all of the Zoe and he says
[1:35:53] if you've got eternal life
[1:35:57] and if that's God for you was in his
[1:35:59] thoughts on the eternal
[1:36:03] first we would see Jesus 1964 304. now
[1:36:08] if you were in his thinking at the
[1:36:10] beginning if you've got eternal life
[1:36:12] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:36:15] eternal life had no beginning and has no
[1:36:17] ending so if you have eternal life you
[1:36:20] are an attribute of God's thinking
[1:36:22] before there was anything but him
[1:36:26] sure as we would see Jesus 1964-18.
[1:36:30] if you got eternal life
[1:36:36] read all of these because they're
[1:36:38] underlined
[1:36:39] voice of the sign 64s
[1:36:42] 321 if you've got eternal life there's
[1:36:46] only one form of eternal life
[1:36:52] we just read that one from
[1:36:54] future home
[1:36:57] God rich in Mercy 1965 with 0 19.
[1:37:02] 019. if you've got eternal life if we
[1:37:05] have eternal life then we always was
[1:37:07] because there's one form of eternal life
[1:37:09] we always were
[1:37:12] excuse me I'll use words
[1:37:15] and the reason we were because we are a
[1:37:18] part of God
[1:37:19] and he's the only one that's eternal
[1:37:25] except because they're repeats
[1:37:28] when their eyes were open 64 312 if you
[1:37:32] got eternal life
[1:37:34] you always was
[1:37:37] what read the rest of these I'm just
[1:37:40] doing it for the type situation
[1:37:42] people out there where they can
[1:37:44] do it
[1:37:46] proving his word
[1:37:50] eternal life
[1:37:51] you always was see you have eternal life
[1:37:54] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:37:56] you were his attribute who is this male
[1:37:59] chedded at 65 221 the evening and if you
[1:38:02] have eternal life you always was not
[1:38:05] your being here but to shape and form
[1:38:08] that the infinite God
[1:38:11] me
[1:38:12] all right thinking man's filter 65 8 22.
[1:38:16] but when you're born to the spirit of
[1:38:18] God then you've got you are a son of God
[1:38:21] and you always was the son of God and
[1:38:23] you always will be a Son of God there's
[1:38:25] no way to separate it because it's you
[1:38:28] have eternal life and the Eternal never
[1:38:29] had no beginning
[1:38:32] take them home and read them
[1:38:35] now that's just a handful that's nothing
[1:38:38] comparative running down your computer
[1:38:40] always was
[1:38:42] in our eternal life and just run run all
[1:38:46] day and look at it so not trying to
[1:38:49] preach to you
[1:38:50] the prophet is saying to you and I if we
[1:38:53] have eternal life the eternal life we
[1:38:56] have right
[1:38:58] now we hadn't got to this point but we
[1:39:00] will but he said the Bible says that his
[1:39:03] seed remaineth in us and we cannot sin
[1:39:07] yet the prophet says we sin every day
[1:39:10] you know what's he saying
[1:39:14] Paul was the one that we're talking
[1:39:15] about for the sins plural
[1:39:18] was he contrary to John that would say
[1:39:21] his seeds remaineth in this and we
[1:39:22] cannot sin then you've got a problem
[1:39:27] but if you're looking at it to see that
[1:39:29] that's mortal human beings are doing
[1:39:31] wrong every day yes because we're mortal
[1:39:33] human beings we have problems
[1:39:35] but that seed that that new birth
[1:39:38] which is a birth of that seed
[1:39:42] which is a birth of the word
[1:39:45] huh
[1:39:47] that always was eternal
[1:39:51] as I was saying even the other day then
[1:39:53] one day the foolish virgins right
[1:39:58] Matthew 25 where they got to five wise
[1:40:01] and five foolish one day those foolish
[1:40:03] virgins will be given eternal life
[1:40:06] you agree
[1:40:08] well you know what
[1:40:10] they're done lived their life out in
[1:40:12] this world they've done diet they've
[1:40:14] done went beyond the curtain of time
[1:40:16] into what situation they could exist in
[1:40:18] and maybe you've been there for
[1:40:19] thousands of years
[1:40:21] and they're not eternal
[1:40:24] they'll be taken up and brought before
[1:40:25] the Watcher on judgment and given
[1:40:28] eternal life
[1:40:30] you know what
[1:40:34] that day they can raise their hands and
[1:40:36] see I always was eternal
[1:40:41] run
[1:40:43] because the eternal life they have
[1:40:45] never had a beginning
[1:40:49] it never had an ending and God's
[1:40:52] thoughts about them
[1:40:53] was always eternal
[1:40:57] yeah
[1:40:58] so the day you get the new birth raise
[1:41:00] your hand and Shout Gloria Hallelujah I
[1:41:03] have eternal life
[1:41:05] always was what the eternal life
[1:41:09] so that's the only way we could be in
[1:41:10] Jesus Christ if we wasn't in Jesus
[1:41:12] Christ
[1:41:13] when he walked the shores of Galilee
[1:41:15] then where did we come from where did
[1:41:18] eternal life you have come from
[1:41:21] it was in him
[1:41:26] see then before the world ever begun
[1:41:29] God
[1:41:30] knew whether or not we would want
[1:41:32] eternal life he had it ready for us
[1:41:36] and his thoughts about us has always
[1:41:38] been
[1:41:39] eternal
[1:41:43] right what is eternal life
[1:41:46] remember my definition of what
[1:41:49] it goes just as far right away
[1:41:52] but if you can't go just as far that
[1:41:54] away
[1:41:57] you say yeah but now I can comprehend
[1:42:00] back so far
[1:42:02] and here's where you got your blockage
[1:42:04] at
[1:42:05] you need to try it you need a uh you
[1:42:07] need to get that huh blockage out of
[1:42:10] your hand
[1:42:13] you see yeah but if I go all the way
[1:42:15] back I'm going to wind up being God I'm
[1:42:18] glad you thought of that because that's
[1:42:20] what I'm appreaching right
[1:42:24] that's the only way to have eternal life
[1:42:26] is what to be a part of God amen amen
[1:42:30] that ain't talking about this body
[1:42:32] spirit and soul as you're looking at
[1:42:33] that's right that's right you're talking
[1:42:35] about eternal life that God gave me
[1:42:37] 1969.
[1:42:41] he gave me eternal life
[1:42:45] that made me a part of God right an
[1:42:48] offspring of God a child of God
[1:42:53] called a son
[1:42:57] then we're called the children of God
[1:42:58] we're called Sons and Daughters that's
[1:43:00] wonderful
[1:43:03] but just remember
[1:43:06] that a son of God
[1:43:08] is God in another form that's right
[1:43:10] thank you Lord or else you got a second
[1:43:13] person involved somewhere right
[1:43:15] right we're not a second person we're
[1:43:18] either God made manifest in human flesh
[1:43:20] upon the earth called the children of
[1:43:22] God
[1:43:24] are we a second person
[1:43:29] what do you think about eternal life
[1:43:32] throw the prophets right we always was
[1:43:36] eternal you wasn't saved on no certain
[1:43:38] day God before the world
[1:43:41] it's all you saved and wrote your name
[1:43:43] down in the Book of Life
[1:43:46] that's where we'll get back to it when
[1:43:47] we get time
[1:43:49] I'm gonna go and redeem this evening
[1:43:51] because we want to go on to that word
[1:43:52] next
[1:43:53] but we'll eventually get back to where
[1:43:55] we can go back there and see how the
[1:43:57] morning stars sing together and the sons
[1:43:58] of God shouted for joy
[1:44:01] in eternity
[1:44:03] my brother Dale I was born with a seed
[1:44:05] in me
[1:44:07] where was it at
[1:44:09] and when was it prepared
[1:44:12] what do you mean when did they put that
[1:44:14] foot down when I was born
[1:44:16] I wouldn't want your Prophet said
[1:44:20] you know Gordon he said the seed was put
[1:44:22] in you
[1:44:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:44:28] wow
[1:44:30] that's right
[1:44:32] that's a lot different than saying when
[1:44:34] it would come into the world
[1:44:37] he said it was put there before the
[1:44:39] foundation of the world
[1:44:40] what
[1:44:41] in God's mind
[1:44:43] as a part of God
[1:44:48] amen
[1:44:50] see the Plan of Redemption is simple
[1:44:53] if we get it in correct order
[1:44:58] that's human Mortals can receive eternal
[1:45:02] life that's only in your soul
[1:45:04] your body and spirit is not eternal
[1:45:07] I don't care how much you think it is
[1:45:09] how can it be
[1:45:13] that's what's keeping us from stepping
[1:45:15] into eternity right
[1:45:17] is the spirit in the body right
[1:45:21] those virtues
[1:45:23] have to come forth from the soul out
[1:45:26] through the spirit
[1:45:29] and bringing the spirit under control
[1:45:32] then the body will walk bear him right
[1:45:35] amen
[1:45:36] what is eternal life right
[1:45:39] and no beginning had no ending right
[1:45:44] see as far as I see God going that way
[1:45:46] and talking to me
[1:45:48] that's eternity
[1:45:50] but then I look back down through there
[1:45:52] and see
[1:45:54] that he said he had fellowship with us
[1:45:55] before the world that's what he told him
[1:45:57] to disciple
[1:46:02] that makes pre-existence
[1:46:05] I believe in pre-existence of the seed
[1:46:08] or eternal life I just don't believe in
[1:46:12] pre-existence
[1:46:14] of mankind like Mormon doctrines of Soul
[1:46:18] Etc I don't believe in it
[1:46:22] I mean
[1:46:24] I believe we come into the world law
[1:46:27] doomed and on our way to hell and
[1:46:30] deserving every bit of it
[1:46:31] God came down and paid a price come on
[1:46:34] come on pay the price
[1:46:37] and all I got to do is accept it part is
[1:46:40] not pardon until received is one but if
[1:46:43] I'll accept it
[1:46:45] then I can have eternal life
[1:46:50] but see that's what I said though we're
[1:46:52] afraid of foreknowledge because see that
[1:46:54] puts it on the basis of what we do and
[1:46:56] don't do
[1:46:59] it see then you'll come up in your mind
[1:47:01] when you ain't worth it salvation I
[1:47:03] don't know what we do or don't do it
[1:47:07] you tell me it's not on you tell me you
[1:47:09] don't have to receive eternal life
[1:47:15] and I'll tell you you're in the delusion
[1:47:18] to the devil
[1:47:21] I'll tell you about Jesus don't
[1:47:23] Nicodemus
[1:47:24] you know the law
[1:47:26] you know all about it they claim they
[1:47:29] knew him so well they could take a
[1:47:30] scroll hold it up stick a pin through
[1:47:32] there and tell you every letter it went
[1:47:33] through because it read them so many
[1:47:34] times
[1:47:36] but when that the greatest because Jesus
[1:47:39] called and said go back to your original
[1:47:40] and read it he said no our deep teacher
[1:47:44] D teacher meant he was the highest
[1:47:47] greatest ranking of all the teachers of
[1:47:50] Israel
[1:47:53] he said you must be born again Nicodemus
[1:47:55] and he said how can I do that
[1:47:59] he said I can't talk to you about these
[1:48:00] things ain't gonna leave me talking to
[1:48:02] you about anything else
[1:48:07] you see if we don't get born again they
[1:48:08] don't need to talk about anything anyway
[1:48:12] my brother now I'll have you to know
[1:48:14] I've been born again I'm tired of you
[1:48:16] bringing it up maybe that I'm not well
[1:48:19] you know what that proves you're not
[1:48:21] safe
[1:48:26] because your attitude
[1:48:28] toward what I said proves you're not
[1:48:30] saying
[1:48:31] if you get offended from me saying you
[1:48:34] need to be born again you're not born
[1:48:36] again is that simple enough I've
[1:48:38] offended people saying it that way run
[1:48:41] them off but I'm sorry that's the truth
[1:48:44] whether it be me you're an idiot
[1:48:47] right if I get mad at you because you
[1:48:49] tell me the truth there's something
[1:48:51] wrong with me
[1:48:56] we need to be born again
[1:49:02] in the morning again because nobody no
[1:49:04] man can call Jesus a Christ except what
[1:49:07] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's
[1:49:09] stand together what do we go through 539
[1:49:12] is final book 539 anybody have a need
[1:49:26] always was yeah if you have Daddy

[1:49:33] always was eternal
[1:49:39] possession
[1:49:47] of looking down watching that Apostle
[1:49:49] Paul
[1:49:54] he not fall off that horse and down onto
[1:49:57] the ground
[1:49:59] yeah
[1:50:01] every from
[1:50:08] old new bird Knock You Down
[1:50:14] in fact it was made
[1:50:17] Chef Jesus Christ is his savior
[1:50:22] what you know in the Bible the message
[1:50:23] is ours how long have you been in it we
[1:50:26] must be born again
[1:50:32] and foreknowledge is still involved
[1:50:39] let's run around and said your gifts are
[1:50:40] predestinated eternally
[1:50:49] cloudful Ministries predestinated
[1:50:52] eternally
[1:50:54] just wanted to tell who was it Jeremiah
[1:50:56] one of them
[1:50:58] back I knew you before the world and
[1:50:59] ordained you into
[1:51:04] they didn't make Jeremiah before the
[1:51:06] world that made that guilt
[1:51:12] foreign
[1:52:19] concerned about
[1:52:24] him and we don't
[1:52:30] really enjoy watch my dad do to me
[1:53:04] salvation
[1:53:10] Ally pray and Believe on it
[1:53:12] father
[1:53:15] you know our sister you knew her before
[1:53:17] the world knew that the nature and ways
[1:53:19] you'd be and all we're doing here today
[1:53:22] is just standing here fulfilling what
[1:53:24] you saw before the world
[1:53:27] and we can just look back there and see
[1:53:28] Lord that you saved US dollar true but
[1:53:31] it's got to be transmitted down unto us
[1:53:34] come to a place that we can realize and
[1:53:37] hear upon this Earth and then it's not
[1:53:39] just a knowledge in our mind
[1:53:42] because that's all you would have done
[1:53:43] with Nicodemus you told him you already
[1:53:45] got knowledge
[1:53:47] he must be born
[1:53:49] or Jesus our sister said she needs it
[1:53:52] and you
[1:53:53] we ask you to just come
[1:54:01] to make her a candidate for you
[1:54:03] for you
[1:54:04] and just fill her with our holy spirit
[1:54:07] because we believe you
[1:54:10] thank you
[1:54:13] just commit everything to you now so you
[1:54:16] with our sister
[1:54:18] about what she has to do
[1:54:23] we can do it
[1:54:27] but we want to believe you
[1:54:30] you father is accepting what you've done
[1:54:39] believe and say
[1:54:40] thank you Lord you say one of that
[1:54:44] or else it can be
[1:54:48] Gloria Hallelujah
[1:54:52] reality you do it
[1:54:57] the reality that yourself
[1:55:25] thank you for the
[1:55:26] University now that you'd go with us as
[1:55:28] we just meet us and go eat a natural
[1:55:30] meal and come back your scene and with
[1:55:31] us
[1:55:32] to understand
[1:55:34] help us to see
[1:55:36] that we truly must receive eternal life
[1:55:39] but then once we receive that eternal
[1:55:41] life
[1:55:42] then that eternal life existence and
[1:55:45] goes just as far one way as it goes
[1:55:47] another
[1:55:48] it doesn't have a beginning it doesn't
[1:55:51] have an ending there was never a time
[1:55:53] that eternity could begin
[1:55:55] because it did it would it would have a
[1:55:58] time to end Lord and it can't do it
[1:56:01] eternity is eternity that's just all the
[1:56:04] words we can use we can make examples
[1:56:07] and thoughts but still
[1:56:09] is one thing for sure there's only one
[1:56:11] eternal and that's God's own life
[1:56:15] the only way we can have eternal life
[1:56:18] is to die out to ourselves
[1:56:21] and accept you as our savior
[1:56:23] and then we have eternal life
[1:56:26] and we wouldn't save them no certain day
[1:56:28] no we wouldn't
[1:56:30] we say before the world but it was
[1:56:33] transmitted down
[1:56:35] to a time that we accept to hear upon
[1:56:37] Earth
