========================================

so we're on matthew chapter five looking at the last attitude let's just read them off just for fun blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they should be comforted blessed are the men they shall inherit the earth bless you blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god and finish it up with this one should all i is maybe one of my favorite blessings because once you become a christian i think everything's uh everything's supposed to be hunky-dory and then people begin to speak bad about you ridicule you and all my stories we could all tell but jesus said blessed are ye blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness satan for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall obey you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake now all the other ones all the other blessings just had one verse but this one actually has two verses it goes into a little bit more detail it's not just blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven but he expands it all out blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake that's the key right there not because you you know if you get pulled over for a speeding ticket and you really were speeding then uh right it's your fault but if if you're ridiculed because of your stand for christ that's what this is talking about rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven how how much joy we should have if we're ridiculed if we stand so close to christ that others hate us because we stand for christ not because of our own problems for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you now that last the last verse covers three abuses revival persecuted so say all manner of evil against you reviling verbal abuse the first one when people just say uh just say all kind of hateful things about you and persecution persecution means to harass trouble or molest the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another group now i was looking for the quote where brother and said brian can't persecute brian he must have worded a little bit different than i remember because um i know what's in there but i couldn't find it and but it should be pretty simple to see that if you're in this group if you're in the group that's under the shed blood then you won't persecute other people because persecution is the mistreatment of people that are in a group that you're not in so looking out you know when uh my wife said just yesterday she was walking through a grocery store and somebody was laughing at her because of the way she dressed um and she and esther got to talking about just when you're just going out in public the the life that you live is an example for other people and i remember um i i've got a lot of people don't know this but i have a degree in art and uh when i was in art school i my senior project was painting i painted these large paintings of elijah going up in the fiery chariot and um daniel and the lion's den and all these biblical scenes and every day this fellow that uh maybe could only be characterized as a sodomite if you catch my drift would come in and make fun of me and uh i just keep fading away but uh it's that that kind of thing he wasn't making fun of me because he was making fun of me because of what i represented because i was painting picture bible characters and bible scenes the things that meant a lot to me because i was a christian he uh he treated me that way now and then the last one the third one defamation of character now this is really interesting one this is when you think this is maybe hits the hardest to a christian because you think i want to live so close to god that other people can see god in my life and then somebody comes along and says you ain't even a christian you're you're uh you're not living the life you're not doing what i expected christians to do you know they even called jesus the fullness of the godhead body they said he was the devil and uh if they'll dwight he said if they'll do that to him our father what will they do to us and um i was reading this story of polycarbonate the early the romans they began to they started a smear campaign against the christians because the christians we only believe there's one god and the romans served many gods so because christians didn't believe in those other gods they started they started a smear campaign by calling christians atheists if you can believe that so polycarp when he was drugged before the uh the council all the people were claiming for his for his blood for his death and they said uh polycarp say make your confession away with the atheist meaning the christians and probably turned around and said he looked at all the people that were screaming for him for his blood and said yes away with the atheist because uh what they were saying accusing him of they were really guilty the guilty party and that's that's the theme all down through history the ones that are the true christians they'll say they'll speak ill of you and say that you're not what they think you should be and what it is is looking uh the the the theme of persecution is they people have their own idea uh and brother brandon call it their manual that they take the church manual the denominational manual and look at that instead of looking at the word in the smyrna in churches he said um instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done substituted the manual for the word just to step outside that manual and see what happens you are out brother and they will persecute you and blame it on god so this is what this is a little a picture of persecution the believer is in this group and the persecutors are outside of that group and that's why they persecute you john 15 18 20 if the world hate you you know that it hated me before i hated you if you were of the world the world will love his own because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my save they will keep yours also now so bride can't persecute bride but uh along the life of journey like a lot look at paul's journey a long life road he started out persecuting the true believers and then when he uh was converted he became the persecutor so in acts 9 this is a couple of verses before he met the pillar of fire and saw yet breathing out threatening and slaughter saying just the first thing that was in that beatitude out of his mouth went i'm i'm gonna kill him against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of it of this way whether they were born they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem then after he met the pillar of fire then he became persecuted persecution age letter and empty persecutions afflictions came unto me at antioch and is where the jews rose up and and uh convert turned all the people against him and remember when they left the city they kicked off the dust from their feet and then iconium they began to uh start talking about how they were going to stone him and that list listener they actually did stone him and drug his body outside of the city and left him from the dead but god raised him up and uh he went forth now you think if at the very least if you're stoned and throwing it's throwing stones as you suffer from brain image or something but god raised him up perfectly and uh persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me and that's the key i leave them all the lord delivered me the footsteps of the order are righteous so order the lord everything happens for a purpose and further on down we'll talk about what the purpose is persecution has a purpose for the christian it's it's it's a big blessing because if you don't if you don't suffer persecution you won't reach the full potential yay and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer suffer persecution they'll laugh at you for the way you dress they'll laugh at you for uh talk about the church you go to um talk about the way you live why don't you uh go out to bars uh and things that at work well like everybody else does you can just go on they single you out for righteousness sake first uh see first peter 2 18 20 service be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the thrower now i put this in here because it's so important that when you are persecuted how your your reaction should be that's right godly toward uh the people that you know if you've got a an evil master or whatever it not don't be good just to the uh don't serve your masters just the ones that are good but also serve the ones that are forward piece of ceiling for them so this is thankfully if a man for conscience toward god and your grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is that if when you be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently i get never pulled pull over for your speaking to you because you really were speeding that's there's no glory in that if you uh put little halos over your head look how pious i am but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with god that persecution is just part of following god philippians 1 29 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his satan so let's go through real quick and look at how believers were persecuted all the way from cain and abel kane killed abel and why did he kill him because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous in genesis 37 39 it tells the story of joseph who was his his brothers hated him the ones that joseph wasn't doing anything evil he just told him a dream about how the all the sheep and wheat bowed down to him and so forth and they threw him in the well and moses god sends a deliverer and all the children physically do is speak evil in exodus 5 21 they said unto him the lord look upon you this is the people of the children of israel telling moses the lord look upon you and judge because you've made our savior our offering to be a poor in the eyes of pharaoh in exodus 14 11 and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt that stopped taking us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has still dealt with us thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt and and so on on exodus 17 the people child with moses and said give us water that we may drink this is when he and and the story and access when he got told to smite the rock and he smote it and moses cried on the lord saying what shall i do under this people they be almost ready to stone to stone their deliverer and then elijah who was also hated in first kings 18 17 it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel first kings 192 then jezebel sent a messenger under elijah saying so let the gods do the million more also if i make not my life is the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and then micah the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there's yet one man micah the son of him love by whom we make we may inquire the lord but i hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil we're in good company when we're approached and their approach for the cause of the word 1962 brother said you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to christ must first be child trained for the purpose that god has ordained before and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he has called you for this there's nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils and torment but what's got what god's word will be made manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators everything else but they'll never take your place so persecution serves a purpose in acts 5 40 41 after the uh peter and the apostles this is when gamaliel testified that uh if they're if they're really oh god let's just hold on and see what happens and uh they turned them loot before they turned the move state they beat them and to him they agreed when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name i think about that when you get all down about things people say that um it's a great blessing to be so close to god that you can uh that you'll be persecuted romans 5 3 and not only so but we glory and tribulations also knowing that tribulation work with patience right abraham's covenant confirmed 1961. uh we'll skip on down but you have to have a bad one to make a good one shine out you have to have a night to appreciate the daylight everybody say come be a christian if everything will go all right no sir it doesn't for a christian all that live godly in christ jesus you'll suffer persecution you've got to be laughed at and make fun of them stomp that keep that make fun of it they call the master of the house bills but how much more would they call them of his disciples so what does persecution do first of all it makes you pray when and things are going wrong at work and stuff boy you can you know sometimes you feel like i don't really know how to pray but when things are going wrong you can really it makes it easy to pray the pressures of life are on you and then it fortifies your faith like brother brown was talking about when reverend uh best uh challenged him and that the time when the pillar of fire came down and he said that people from all hundreds of miles away came around came believers from all around came together to uh because they believed what brother branham was standing for and they wanted to uh that's the next one draws believers closer together and fortifies you by your faith because they they believed what was being stood for and you know when people say something uh negative about what you believe for that that ain't true um now that's kind of out of a different class and then persecution because you know a lot of times we'll have our own little disagreements and stuff among us but um but when that happens if i if i say i don't you know show me that quote where brother rem and such then it makes you go back to his word and study and and uh check things out and fortifies what you believe so you really know what you stand on like uh thinking back to when it started being been spoken people began to speak about how jesus wasn't god until the river jordan well uh it made me go back and well they're saying it with conviction let's go make sure that brother brown didn't say didn't say that and sure enough he didn't say it like that and it draws believers closer that's what this is what it should do when we uh when we're we're down and out and people are saying things about one of us we should all come together and buy them closer and and so many times brother brown talked about as persecution gets stronger as they as they talked about when they close the church doors and everything then it should make us draw closer together and the little pity differences that we all have amongst each other then they they fall away that's right then we start getting closer closer to god and closer to one another in the restoration of the bride tree and that's the way mockery laughing making fun of a christian what it does is persecution shapes the christian to make him pray more dig down get a better hole so he can stay in the storm he's talking about how the little tree gets blown not blown by the wind but it just digs its roots in deeper an early spiritual experience is 1952 when persecution you'll forget whether you're a methodist or baptist or whoever you are when the persecution rises and communism sets down the church of god will run together stoned by stone your little differences will be all forgotten there and then he talks about river and best when everybody came from five or six hundred miles that day to stay with him together we stand divided we fall all the way christian so if every one time we ought to stick together is now that's down persecution and trials are a natural normal part of the christian life there's only one thing you can do about it commit them all to god judge not and leave their outworking and final judgment to him and then this money and church agent said his approval of any of us is only in the beloved is the love is elected which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us he's talking about uh you know don't think that you're not a christian because things aren't going good and don't think you are a christian because things are going don't don't look at the outside how things are going in your life to see whether you're a christian or not but when we know we're a christian because how do we know we shall know because he said so and manifest that he didn't love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself of joy against the trials that he has wisdom allows to come past that's the end okay thank you
