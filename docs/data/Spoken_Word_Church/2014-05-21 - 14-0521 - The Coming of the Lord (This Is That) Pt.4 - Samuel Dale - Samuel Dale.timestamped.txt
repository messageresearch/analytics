[3:46] man
[3:47] Acts 2
[3:50] we're going to read verse 1 through 4
[3:52] then we're jumping over
[3:54] to verse 15 through 21 all right
[3:58] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[4:00] come they were all with one Accord in
[4:02] one place
[4:03] and sooner there came a sound from
[4:05] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[4:08] filled all the house where they were
[4:09] sitting there appeared unto them cloven
[4:12] tongues like as a fire and they set up
[4:14] on each of them and they were all filled
[4:16] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[4:18] with tongues as the spirit gave them
[4:22] utterance now jump over to the to say
[4:25] reading
[4:26] verse 15.
[4:29] for these are not drunken as you suppose
[4:31] seeing in his but the third hour of the
[4:34] day
[4:34] but this is that which was spoken of by
[4:37] Joel
[4:38] the prophet Joel and it came and it
[4:40] shall come to pass in the last days
[4:42] saith God I will pour out my spirit upon
[4:45] All Flesh and your sons and your
[4:47] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[4:50] men shall see visions of your old men
[4:51] shall dream dreams and on my servants
[4:54] and on my handmaids I will pour out in
[4:57] those days of my spirit and they shall
[4:59] prophesy and I will show wonders in the
[5:02] heaven and signs in the earth beneath
[5:04] blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the
[5:08] sun shall not the sun shall be turned
[5:10] into darkness and the moon into blood
[5:12] before that great and notable day of the
[5:15] Lord come and it shall come to pass that
[5:18] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[5:20] Lord shall be saved you may be seated
[5:24] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[5:27] of the word now
[5:30] what we've been doing
[5:32] is
[5:33] looking at a lot of things in the Bible
[5:37] that compare
[5:41] um
[5:41] are in connection to each other
[5:43] happening in stages or or advents as
[5:48] we've read you know and trying to get
[5:51] something in our thoughts to look at it
[5:54] and the main thing is to not look
[5:58] forward for something to come
[6:02] and already be here
[6:06] but to recognize in our day
[6:09] in its message see we've recognized as
[6:12] we say all the time we recognize the
[6:13] prophet thank God for that now but what
[6:17] about you and I
[6:19] see we have a day Martin Luther was a
[6:21] messenger of his day and he brought the
[6:24] message and and the people then received
[6:27] the message and became the message and
[6:30] they were the ones that turned the world
[6:32] upside down because the Catholic
[6:34] churches I've said many times they
[6:36] wasn't upset with Luther that was one
[6:38] person
[6:39] but when a lot of people begin to turn
[6:42] away from them into his Direction they
[6:46] got upset all right and see the devil
[6:49] you know
[6:51] he is going about now
[6:55] in every way he can to try to
[6:58] um
[6:59] conquer
[7:00] whatever the people of this message to
[7:04] try to keep them from seeing who they
[7:07] are
[7:07] and the hour that they're living
[7:10] and to recognize themselves
[7:13] and that's what I've been dealing with
[7:15] for 45 years or more is to try to get
[7:18] you and I to see Who We Are
[7:21] amen no age is ever amounted to anything
[7:25] until the people of that age
[7:28] saw who they were right you know then
[7:31] they went forth and I even said about
[7:33] Jesus even picked up the Scrolls and
[7:36] read it said this day this scripture is
[7:38] fulfilled all right he saw that
[7:41] you know and he saw that was the time
[7:44] then putting it dire to where we can
[7:47] understand
[7:49] now I'll get back to the main reason of
[7:51] reading acts in a little while but
[7:54] oh
[7:56] what I want you to look at is that this
[7:59] writing here in the book of Acts
[8:02] it has a compound meaning to it
[8:05] all right
[8:06] it spoke of the Holy Ghost back there
[8:09] that would fall
[8:11] you know and be on the people and it did
[8:14] all right but then it was also speaking
[8:18] of the end time because it talks about
[8:20] the last days and you know if you need
[8:23] these I'll give them to you if you want
[8:26] them we're right around them would say
[8:27] the last two thousand years
[8:29] I mean and on Azusa Street see the Holy
[8:32] Ghost came down and fulfilling in a
[8:35] second form or for a phase or stage or
[8:39] Advent or whatever
[8:41] the prophecy of Joel because in the
[8:45] prophecy of Joel the first part in
[8:48] relating to Pentecost
[8:51] there was only a true 120 Upper Room
[8:55] people that were Jews all right in that
[8:59] outpouring
[9:00] right but it says it I performed on All
[9:03] Flesh see so that would mean that would
[9:06] be a fulfillment back there for that and
[9:10] Peter said in his message here this is
[9:14] that
[9:15] all right it was spoken of
[9:18] my joy all right that fulfills that
[9:22] but it didn't fulfill all of it
[9:25] because it would come over in the end
[9:27] time and the spirit would be poured out
[9:30] upon All Flesh and then it really would
[9:33] be saying upon my sons and my daughters
[9:36] in other words and then you're handmaids
[9:39] and you're see it would be pour out upon
[9:42] everybody
[9:43] in the end time all right now we should
[9:46] recognize those things
[9:48] and then that way would we we would not
[9:50] be looking for something
[9:54] to come but to realize it's already come
[9:59] all right
[10:00] so then we can stand here today and I
[10:03] looked at a lot of them you can go
[10:04] through the message and you can take it
[10:07] this is that
[10:09] and the prophet you've heard him say it
[10:11] many times if this ain't that let me
[10:14] keep this until that gets here
[10:16] of it so enjoyable where it is now what
[10:20] about what it be when it comes but but I
[10:22] believe he believed it that was it don't
[10:24] you
[10:25] and I I believe that was it
[10:27] but I'm trying to get us to to look and
[10:30] not look forward to something
[10:33] if anything look back and see the things
[10:36] are fulfilled
[10:37] you know in Parts but yet they have a
[10:41] meaning for the hour that you and I are
[10:45] living all right
[10:47] now
[10:49] we have been covering for some time
[10:52] and what we're going to do Sunday
[10:54] morning and Lord willing is try to to
[10:57] kind of finalize what I've been dealing
[11:00] with and then we'll have Sunday
[11:02] afternoon we'll have questions and
[11:04] answers so you write it down you know
[11:06] thoughts comments
[11:09] and we'll get to that
[11:11] we've been covering see how that like
[11:13] the Lord himself second Thessalonians
[11:16] shall you know
[11:19] descend with a shout voice of an
[11:21] archangel and a trumpet and we know that
[11:24] the shout is The Voice or the message of
[11:27] the the end time so we've already
[11:30] received that
[11:32] all right and we're in the stage part
[11:35] not of the uh trumpet to go away
[11:39] we're in the stage part of the uh voice
[11:42] of the Archangel and Christ become
[11:45] invisible put around and said among us
[11:47] and would raise the dead and we'd go in
[11:50] a Rapture all right now and then we went
[11:53] into the coming of the Lord
[11:57] and there's many parts to be related to
[12:00] the coming of the Lord but we're not
[12:02] concerned with what's to Israel that's
[12:05] their part we're not concerned with the
[12:07] end of the world
[12:09] Etc we shouldn't be concerned about
[12:11] those things we ought to be concerned
[12:14] about you know where we're at
[12:17] all right and then that way the prophet
[12:20] said
[12:22] that there's three advents to the coming
[12:24] of the Lord
[12:26] one is that he comes
[12:29] to
[12:30] redeem his right
[12:33] The Second Adventure part you know
[12:35] States
[12:37] would be to catch his bride away
[12:41] and in the third stage would be to come
[12:44] back into millennium
[12:46] with his bride all right now so in our
[12:50] last parts of what we were talking about
[12:52] this past Sunday afternoon especially
[12:55] was to relate that see to not you take
[13:00] scriptures and I was reading it today
[13:04] and it's in here somewhere if I can
[13:06] remember to pull out which one
[13:07] but the prophet said you know we're
[13:10] always looking back we're always looking
[13:11] forward we're doing these things failing
[13:14] to see what's going on now well what's
[13:16] going on now is the important thing
[13:18] there is not a tomorrow
[13:21] it is not here and once we get there it
[13:24] won't be tomorrow it'll be today so why
[13:26] worry about those things of what's to
[13:29] come what's to be uh you know uh see
[13:33] most people when you say the three
[13:36] comings of the Lord in related to the
[13:38] bride and we come to redeem his bride he
[13:40] comes to take it right away and then
[13:42] he'll come back in the millennium I
[13:45] won't know what's going in the
[13:45] millennium
[13:47] I want to know what's going to be there
[13:49] well why
[13:52] not get wait and get there amen
[13:55] amen it's like a little kid with a toy
[13:57] he can't wait to open it
[14:00] you know
[14:01] you tell him at Christmas you know we
[14:04] you just tell him you know well you got
[14:06] well he wants to do everything in the
[14:08] world getting that toy
[14:10] well see that's what we want to do why
[14:11] not let it be a big surprise
[14:14] we know a lot about the Millennium yeah
[14:17] and that's good but why spend our time
[14:22] thinking about that when we should be
[14:24] thinking about the parts related to us
[14:28] now he's already come to redeem
[14:31] all right
[14:33] you come in the Millennium will come
[14:35] back with him physically
[14:37] all right but be concerned with where we
[14:39] are now
[14:41] and you'd be surprised how the world
[14:43] religion thinks of the second coming as
[14:46] it would call it of Christ
[14:48] and and they have it in a physical forms
[14:51] and all kind of relationships and you
[14:54] know
[14:55] instead of it being
[14:57] you know the true way
[15:00] but
[15:02] if he comes as a thief in a night then
[15:04] how can it be a physical
[15:07] and we went through that that Jesus does
[15:09] not put his feet on Earth
[15:13] in a physical form until
[15:16] in the millennial reign all right we
[15:20] meet him in the air
[15:22] Joe then people are saying oh he's
[15:24] coming this he's coming that was doing
[15:26] it what are you talking about
[15:28] yeah but the Bible says ever I'll see
[15:30] him
[15:31] and we're in the day with unit with
[15:34] internets and things and
[15:36] it doesn't make any difference ever I
[15:38] couldn't see him
[15:42] go to a lot of places that don't go
[15:46] but see then the Millennium would have
[15:48] to be the coming of the Lord in
[15:50] relationship with that scripture
[15:52] that then ever I could see
[15:55] you know all right well see then we're
[15:58] trying to place one here and one here
[16:01] and we got it all figured out as our our
[16:03] ways of thinking
[16:06] but is that his way of thinking
[16:10] all right the last message was what had
[16:13] earned first John where it talks about
[16:15] the appearing and the coming
[16:18] all right
[16:20] and the prophet we went through that
[16:21] Sunday afternoon there and he said he's
[16:24] appearing Among Us now
[16:27] sick being healed all kind of signs and
[16:30] wonders taking place in his appearing
[16:33] but he said now the appearing and the
[16:35] coming
[16:36] is two different things
[16:39] all right
[16:41] so now we would
[16:43] um sound a trumpet to the part of him
[16:46] saying well he's here now appearing
[16:48] Among Us
[16:50] and that's what most people preach how
[16:53] that it was Dire in him and and all of
[16:56] that
[16:57] but what about his coming
[17:00] was he his coming
[17:03] well that's what a lot of them try to
[17:04] preach you know
[17:07] and then they take it into the 63 and
[17:09] the coming of the Lord and the different
[17:11] things
[17:12] but
[17:14] why did we wind up talking about
[17:18] if this is not a physical coming
[17:21] and we're not talking about to the world
[17:22] we're not talking on that we're talking
[17:24] about to the bride
[17:26] because when brother Brown said there's
[17:28] three comings he relates it to the bride
[17:32] but we know there is at least two more
[17:34] comings into the world and to the Jews
[17:38] all right
[17:39] so then think about it
[17:42] in the prophet's message and down
[17:44] through time God has been appearing
[17:50] right
[17:51] but then a stage begin to develop in the
[17:55] ministry of the prophet
[17:58] until
[18:00] when the seals begin to be open the
[18:02] things
[18:05] that he began to talk about him being
[18:09] here
[18:10] in a way that was
[18:14] you know beyond all things
[18:18] he would talk of him present you know
[18:20] like
[18:21] and I know I've always just been
[18:23] wondered when I goof up I always admit
[18:25] it
[18:26] and try to get it straight that's the
[18:28] best way we get down to the message
[18:31] where we've always quoted that right
[18:34] around and said I'm not saying he's
[18:35] coming I'm saying he's here that's
[18:37] really talking about the Antichrist
[18:41] I mean the direct quote is talking about
[18:43] the enemy
[18:45] I'll give you that in a minute
[18:47] and you know but I still believe one
[18:50] thing
[18:51] if the enemy's here
[18:53] then he comes second
[18:56] he don't come first
[18:58] all right that's right what I've been
[19:01] saying is right but just quoting brother
[19:02] random and you'd say well he didn't
[19:04] throw them I'm talking about the enemy
[19:06] okay you got me
[19:10] Crow
[19:12] but listen to the rest of the message
[19:14] you know I at least to admit it and
[19:18] about what about you okay get over there
[19:23] but see we know that part of his coming
[19:27] and already
[19:29] happened
[19:32] because he's already come to redeem
[19:35] all right so we're not looking for a
[19:38] another Coming For That
[19:41] and we know that the second part of his
[19:44] coming the prophet said is to catch the
[19:46] bride away
[19:48] and for her to get ready
[19:50] during this time amen all right
[19:54] now I want to use a scripture and
[19:58] approach it from
[20:00] you know a point and then we'll get into
[20:03] the main point I want to say so go ahead
[20:05] brother
[20:06] uh
[20:08] and pull up Matthew 24.
[20:13] and let's think about it
[20:17] Matthew 24 1-3
[20:20] and Jesus went out and departed from the
[20:22] temple and disciples came to him to show
[20:26] him the buildings of the temple and
[20:28] Jesus said unto them
[20:30] seeing out all these things really I say
[20:32] unto you there shall not be left here
[20:34] one stone upon another that shall not be
[20:38] thrown down now we've been through that
[20:39] oh that read that memorize that right
[20:44] and as you set up on the Mount of Olives
[20:45] now brother run said that was in the
[20:47] morning he said now here he comes in the
[20:49] evening
[20:49] as you set up on the Mount of Olives the
[20:51] disciples came unto him privately saying
[20:55] tell us when shall these things be
[21:00] now he doesn't put anything up here
[21:02] about that does it that's one stone upon
[21:05] another
[21:05] they know that he's talking about
[21:08] something
[21:10] so they continue the thought
[21:13] all right and what shall be the sign of
[21:16] thy coming
[21:17] they knew he had been talking about his
[21:20] coming
[21:21] and brother random the quote is said he
[21:24] spoke more of his second coming than he
[21:26] did his first
[21:28] all right
[21:29] so then without to relate that all right
[21:32] one shall be the sign of thy coming
[21:34] out of the end of the world
[21:36] all right
[21:38] so
[21:40] the runner says he answered those three
[21:43] questions
[21:46] and he goes straight to Matthew 24 and
[21:49] he takes the seals because that's in the
[21:51] Sixth Seal where he's doing it
[21:53] and in The Sixth Seal he takes Matthew
[21:55] 24. in Revelation 6 and Compares them
[22:00] together right you remember all right
[22:03] and in doing that he shows
[22:06] how this is what this is what this is
[22:08] what and he said he answered all three
[22:11] questions
[22:13] all right
[22:15] so now he put it in the scripture
[22:19] When shall these things be
[22:22] we know that's Titus
[22:24] you know there won't be one stone left
[22:26] on another Titus in 87 he came in
[22:30] and destroyed Jerusalem
[22:32] all right
[22:34] now I'm looking at the quotes if you
[22:36] desire them
[22:37] that's the way the prophet explained it
[22:40] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[22:45] all right so he puts it in the scripture
[22:49] and he immediately starts talking about
[22:53] the Antichrist
[22:55] I was talking about Matthew 24 of the
[22:58] the things and when he says lo here low
[23:00] there don't go read Matthew 24.
[23:05] all right
[23:06] and when you do you'll find
[23:09] that in answering all three of those
[23:11] questions
[23:13] he's talking to
[23:16] the bride of Christ
[23:18] he's talking to the Natural Jew which
[23:20] they were they will be interrelated unto
[23:24] it
[23:25] but yet
[23:28] we don't need to be concerned about
[23:30] Titus
[23:32] that's already gone
[23:34] and there's no need for us to be
[23:36] concerned with the end of the world
[23:38] don't you want to know when the end of
[23:40] work no
[23:42] but I'd be worried to death
[23:45] and you would too
[23:47] and you've got
[23:49] he's coming in a month he's coming in
[23:51] the Years coming we got to get ready
[23:53] you know they don't ain't worried about
[23:55] her forget it
[23:57] but we ought to be concerned with
[24:00] when he said the sign
[24:04] of thy coming
[24:06] for them
[24:08] no
[24:10] that should be the thing that you and I
[24:12] should be concerned about tonight
[24:15] all right
[24:17] the sign of thy coming
[24:20] okay
[24:23] then if the sign of thy coming
[24:30] we'll read it in a little bit
[24:32] and we've always talked about it it's a
[24:34] secret coming
[24:39] and a secret coming is like a thief in
[24:41] the night
[24:43] the scripture speaks of
[24:45] and it's like in Luke there where it
[24:46] speaks of
[24:48] two in the bed one taken one left two in
[24:50] the field one taken one left you know
[24:52] Etc
[24:53] it covers those things as to being in
[24:58] his coming
[25:01] but what what is the sign
[25:06] of his coming
[25:08] you know
[25:10] what is the sign of his coming
[25:18] see because that's what we need to be
[25:20] concerned about
[25:22] all right
[25:24] jump on over to number six I'm gonna
[25:26] quit writing these things down one of
[25:27] these days and I don't use them go to
[25:29] number six brother
[25:30] recognizing your day in this message
[25:33] and look what he says
[25:37] if they only recognized a promised sign
[25:40] of the Messiah
[25:43] the sign of the son of man
[25:50] he come in the name of the son of man
[25:54] sign of his coming is the Messiah sign
[26:00] now we fall back to Luke 17 30.
[26:03] in a day when the son of man would be
[26:05] revealed right
[26:07] he would go back to the prophet's
[26:09] message
[26:11] it will go through his message
[26:13] and we see that the Lord Jesus had the
[26:16] Messiah sign
[26:20] it was a sign of the Resurrection
[26:22] all right Joy that God had raised
[26:26] they're in him not because he's dead and
[26:28] gone he was Dire
[26:30] all right
[26:31] when it comes over in our day
[26:34] then the sign of the son of man
[26:39] see brother random will stand there and
[26:41] he'd say
[26:43] now here's what Jesus done
[26:46] and he says now let's see if he'll do
[26:49] the same thing
[26:51] all right
[26:53] now anybody with one-eyed or Brother Don
[26:55] ruddle you say that tickle me
[26:58] anybody with one-eyed in high sense
[27:01] I know that's pretty good quote
[27:04] I ought to know that we have had the
[27:07] sign of the Resurrection Among Us
[27:11] in the ministry of the prophet
[27:14] right
[27:16] because that was what all of that was
[27:17] about that's why I said none of the
[27:20] writers Paul or none of them talked
[27:22] about the son of man
[27:24] here come the seventh grade education
[27:26] man walks out there
[27:29] and he starts talking about the son of
[27:32] man
[27:34] when even the scholars wrote very little
[27:37] of him
[27:38] you know in that form of what that would
[27:41] mean it would relate it back to Jesus
[27:45] are coming to the Jews
[27:50] you see
[27:52] so what is the sign of the
[27:56] coming of the Lord that you and I need
[27:58] to be concerned about
[28:03] the prophet's message
[28:05] that was brought to you and I
[28:09] that word that he was doing was the son
[28:13] of man
[28:15] he was a son of man right right
[28:18] he said I'm not the son of man I'm a son
[28:21] of man
[28:21] these son of man is the Lord Jesus
[28:24] Christ
[28:25] all right but the Lord Jesus Christ came
[28:28] down in a man in our day
[28:32] and done as he said more was done in one
[28:36] service
[28:38] than was even recorded
[28:41] in the Bible and things
[28:43] of the ministry of Jesus Christ
[28:45] now that's something in it
[28:49] we can all look back
[28:52] and see
[28:53] the sign of the son of man
[28:56] we can all look back and talk about
[28:59] those days
[29:02] talk about the
[29:04] the great things that happened
[29:10] and all that's well and good
[29:13] and newcomers coming in must hear that
[29:17] right because remember we don't all come
[29:18] in at once and remember we don't know a
[29:21] whole lot when we come in
[29:23] and I don't care how much you say I knew
[29:25] this and I knew that that's a grain of
[29:28] salt compared to the entire ocean
[29:31] what little bit I saw before I come into
[29:34] the message is that what I compare it to
[29:36] one grain of salt compared with all the
[29:39] salt in the ocean all right
[29:42] but what is now
[29:47] the sign of the son of man
[29:51] It's The Sign of the Messiah
[29:56] showing he is risen
[29:59] all right
[30:02] and brother random we read there the
[30:04] other day said if he let this world go
[30:06] on you know without coming to give the
[30:10] end time sign
[30:12] it'd be unjust
[30:14] you remember because he was back there
[30:17] but then he put us up on Theology and we
[30:20] had to make our decisions about he said
[30:23] that wouldn't be right
[30:24] he said
[30:26] so he'd sinned
[30:29] the sign of the son of man
[30:33] the sound of his coming
[30:36] was that what Jesus said
[30:41] they asked him what would be the sign of
[30:43] thy coming
[30:45] well one day the skies are split and all
[30:48] this will take place I'll let go read
[30:51] Matthew 24.
[30:55] I didn't make the statement not
[30:58] responsible but he is
[31:00] he said he answered all three questions
[31:03] in Matthew 24.
[31:06] I thought about reading that I had
[31:08] something to read about the in The Sixth
[31:10] Seal of the things but
[31:12] you that are sitting here tonight
[31:14] shouldn't have to have
[31:16] these things you ought to know the
[31:18] message
[31:21] what is the sign of die coming
[31:26] what are we to look for
[31:31] to think about the coming
[31:35] that we're talking about not talking
[31:36] about the end of the world not talking
[31:38] about the coming to the Jews
[31:44] we're talking about the coming to the
[31:46] bride
[31:47] what is the sign that the bride is
[31:50] supposed to be dwelling on at this time
[31:58] the sign of the Resurrected
[32:02] Messiah
[32:07] and that's what that Prophet see when he
[32:09] walked out there people had the Holy
[32:11] Ghost right
[32:12] Holy Ghost come on today Azusa Street in
[32:14] the fullness there
[32:16] you know
[32:18] right around call it a great prophet
[32:21] go to 464 the silver and read it
[32:27] but see then here he comes
[32:31] and he begins to speak
[32:35] about the son of man
[32:39] you know what God come behind him and
[32:43] Vindicated it
[32:44] right
[32:47] sick was healed dead was raised but you
[32:49] know it wasn't just in his ministry
[32:54] who wouldn't Smith Wiggles worth I try
[32:56] and think of him the other day when him
[32:57] one of them well what is 17 times or
[33:00] something like that of the Dead raised
[33:06] all right
[33:08] let's see Smith Wigglesworth didn't have
[33:10] the fully revealed word
[33:14] huh as I told you Clarence Larkin before
[33:18] brought around him said the white horse
[33:19] rider was the Antichrist
[33:22] but he wasn't the prophet and didn't
[33:24] have the word
[33:28] even though he was writing what he said
[33:32] there's got to be a message
[33:36] and run around and said these signs and
[33:39] things
[33:41] is to get the attention
[33:44] of the people
[33:47] is that right
[33:51] boy look the Lord's mama look no
[33:56] what was he trying to get the attention
[33:58] to the people for
[34:01] you know that all the times of prophet
[34:02] no signs was taking place everybody
[34:04] loved him right
[34:06] oh they wanted him it was like the Lord
[34:09] Jesus this young Prophet From Galilee we
[34:12] love him he can feed us he can do all
[34:15] the things
[34:19] but then when he began to say I and my
[34:21] father are one
[34:23] right
[34:26] see brother random was popular until he
[34:28] began to
[34:30] preach the word
[34:33] and then what did I tell him you're
[34:35] called to pray for the sick leave the
[34:37] preaching to us you say well there's not
[34:40] a direct quote of that but what do you
[34:41] think they were saying
[34:43] come on get a little sense
[34:47] what do you think they were saying
[34:50] said leave that to the others
[34:53] you just pray for the sick
[34:56] praying for the sick was just a sign
[35:00] it wasn't the voice
[35:04] right
[35:06] see we must be dealing with a voice to
[35:08] be able to relate to Lord himself she'll
[35:11] send him heaven and Shout voice of an
[35:12] archangel
[35:15] what are you following me
[35:19] what is the sign of the son of man
[35:26] all right it's the resurrection sign
[35:28] okay we go with that
[35:33] but is it just
[35:36] it just sounds like that
[35:42] or was there a message to father
[35:45] those signs
[35:48] okay
[35:50] my brother Bosworth said what said
[35:52] brother Reynolds said to bait on the
[35:54] hook it's just a tantalize her you know
[35:57] I mean just get the attention of the
[35:59] fish
[36:04] see the main thing is the message
[36:08] the Lord Jesus had a message
[36:11] right
[36:14] well I'm just Matthew Mark Luke and John
[36:17] is just some little things that he'd
[36:18] done he told about what he'd done now
[36:20] the Irish word you don't read
[36:23] go in the seal book
[36:25] to the six seal and read it
[36:28] where brother random Compares I said a
[36:31] moment ago Matthew 24.
[36:36] to revelation 6.
[36:39] and places the seals right up to the
[36:42] sixth one and in Matthew 24 what is it
[36:46] 30 something
[36:48] when it starts talking about
[36:51] the tribulation
[36:54] and that was so related in his writings
[36:56] until we Baptists taught that Jesus
[36:59] spoke of a tribulation
[37:02] because it's in the Bible
[37:05] I see Jesus brought a message
[37:09] Matthew 24 is his message
[37:12] that's really when he said I and my
[37:15] father are one
[37:22] because when he would say
[37:24] unless you believe that I am healed and
[37:26] you said they pay no attention
[37:28] oh y'all later they said you're a man
[37:31] making yourself God
[37:36] but what really made him upset with him
[37:40] not the signs of the Wonders
[37:45] right
[37:47] it was the message he brought
[37:49] what made brother Branham very unpopular
[37:52] until in the end time preaching in a
[37:54] trailer with 30 or sometime or less
[37:58] in his early Ministry of three or four
[38:00] hundred thousand
[38:02] in a meeting
[38:05] the message brother Branham began to
[38:07] bring
[38:13] was the opening of the word
[38:17] now what part then if we're not to be
[38:20] concerned with a physical coming
[38:23] if we're not to be concerned with a
[38:25] cool
[38:27] 16 element body
[38:29] Etc
[38:31] in our part
[38:35] what are we to be concerned with
[38:41] foreign
[38:48] you see Church the difference in brother
[38:50] Branham and
[38:52] the people in his day was one thing
[38:56] he had a message
[38:59] they had signs and wonders
[39:02] if I misquote this you just put it the
[39:04] old ignorance
[39:06] but he's told one time that he prayed
[39:08] for a man's nose to be restored and it
[39:10] was two or three weeks somebody else he
[39:13] gave in there was at Bosworth three
[39:15] times
[39:16] one one of me said that man prayed for
[39:20] her nose to be restored and it was
[39:22] instantly
[39:24] restored
[39:29] there was a lot of healing going on in
[39:32] the day when the prophet began to
[39:38] go out with his message
[39:40] but there was only one message
[39:44] and he said if you go on with the same
[39:46] simple message or come with it
[39:48] and he said and signs and wonders follow
[39:50] it
[39:53] he said don't do that
[40:00] see is God sending it among us to Thrice
[40:07] what is the sign of thy coming then
[40:10] Jesus we ask you the question
[40:15] he turned right around and answered the
[40:17] question
[40:18] but because he didn't use the words that
[40:22] they thought
[40:23] see mankind turn to get left let's do
[40:26] that let's I know where they are I got a
[40:28] little time I'm ahead tonight so let's
[40:30] just read Matthew 24.
[40:33] I was going to do this and I thought no
[40:35] surely everybody knows it
[40:38] or it went through down to verse three
[40:40] and one shall be the sign of thy coming
[40:42] and the end of the world
[40:44] and brother Brianna says 368 to see a
[40:46] book 408 of the seal for 368 I know for
[40:50] sure said he answered three questions
[40:53] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[40:54] take heed that no man deceive you
[40:58] for a minute shall come in my name
[40:59] saying I am Christ
[41:02] and shall deceive many that's the random
[41:05] place is that one
[41:07] and puts it with the first seal the
[41:10] white horse rider
[41:11] read you see a book
[41:14] for a minute shall come in my name
[41:16] saying I am Christ and deceive many and
[41:20] you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[41:23] wars he places that right in
[41:25] to the second seal
[41:27] for Nations shall rise against nation
[41:29] and kingdoms against Kingdom
[41:31] places in the third seal
[41:34] verse 9 and then they shall deliver you
[41:36] up to be afflicted and shall kill you
[41:38] you shall be hated of all nations from
[41:40] my name and shall many be offended and
[41:43] shall betray one another and shall hate
[41:45] one another and many false prophets
[41:47] shall rise and shall deceive many
[41:50] he places that
[41:52] as a force seal
[41:55] remember he answered them all
[41:58] but he that shall endure to the end oh
[42:00] excuse me and because iniquity shall
[42:03] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[42:05] that he that shall endure unto the end
[42:07] the same shall be saved this Gospel of
[42:11] the Kingdom shall be preached in all the
[42:12] world or witness that are in places that
[42:15] in
[42:16] the first real
[42:19] then he goes to
[42:24] Matthew
[42:29] 24 28
[42:31] for where so ever the carcass is shall
[42:34] the Eagles be gathered together we know
[42:36] that's in the bride immediately after
[42:38] the tribulation of those days verse 29
[42:41] and 30 goes right straight into the
[42:44] Sixth Seal
[42:45] so Jesus
[42:46] spoke of six seals
[42:50] the son of man
[42:53] wrote a message
[42:57] not to just talk about him and the
[42:59] father being one
[43:04] you know them old Jews standing there
[43:06] that's right we want
[43:09] we won with him he's our daddy
[43:15] well how come they got upset with him
[43:17] when they believed it God was their
[43:18] daddy
[43:20] and he just said God wasn't that what he
[43:21] said
[43:25] he said if you get upset with me about
[43:26] it he said all I said was that I'm a son
[43:28] of God
[43:29] you know
[43:31] and that's what you are yeah
[43:35] yeah what separated
[43:37] window signs and the Wonders
[43:40] especially in this relationship to the
[43:43] end time
[43:44] of the outpouring of the spirit as we
[43:47] read want to go upon All Flesh
[43:51] what made the difference
[43:56] the message he brought
[44:00] the message he brought was really the
[44:01] proof of him being one with his father
[44:05] Cody said I do nothing until the father
[44:07] shows me now if he didn't do nothing
[44:10] until he showed him and brother Brown
[44:11] said he'd get a vision you go do it you
[44:13] know raise ladders Etc well now if he'd
[44:16] done nothing until the father showed him
[44:18] then he didn't speak
[44:22] until the father showed him
[44:25] right
[44:27] is that true now so you're getting the
[44:29] message are you relating the message to
[44:32] what I'm talking about what is the sign
[44:34] of thy coming
[44:38] there was to be a message come in the
[44:40] end time
[44:42] a prophet would come and preach six
[44:44] seals
[44:46] and relate it right back into Matthew 24
[44:48] to show that Jesus had preached six
[44:50] seals
[44:53] and Iran's message didn't begin until
[44:54] the opening of the seals come on how
[44:57] much do you need of that Rapture message
[44:59] he said not in the days of the doing but
[45:02] in the when he begins to sound
[45:08] the other was restoration back to the
[45:11] face of the fathers and then his message
[45:13] those things had already been brought by
[45:15] the apostles
[45:18] and he had to come and preach it back to
[45:20] that part then his message would come
[45:27] and see then that's the the problem with
[45:29] mankind
[45:31] see they're looking for something to
[45:33] come
[45:34] when the Lord had already descended from
[45:36] heaven with a shout
[45:42] and he's already in the second stage of
[45:45] his coming in the bride
[45:50] and what did we read the other day
[45:53] in the bride coming of Christ
[45:56] coming out of the church he said
[46:04] why should we be concerned that's the
[46:06] biggest thing that I've said about the
[46:08] people of the message you let anybody go
[46:10] for it well some got a little sign
[46:12] everybody runs for it
[46:17] yeah but he he don't believe that well
[46:20] the Lord's vindicating him
[46:25] he's not vindicating him
[46:31] signs and wonders falling everywhere
[46:35] and it will get more and more
[46:40] so how much deceiving is it
[46:43] but what about the message
[46:48] you know what most people would be and
[46:50] I'm just as honest thing because I said
[46:52] this for 45 years and I'm done against
[46:54] anybody but you let the Baptist Church
[46:56] you let healings and signs and wonders
[46:59] fall in any church Baptist Methodist but
[47:02] Catholics or whatever
[47:05] the biggest force of people this message
[47:06] would run over there
[47:09] let's go check it out
[47:13] I can quote
[47:16] right after brother random passed away
[47:19] there was a man that had signs and
[47:21] wonders
[47:25] some name brands went to check him out
[47:37] he
[47:39] Ard
[47:43] I let this happen God says
[47:45] to try you
[47:47] try you to what to see where you'll try
[47:50] to stir up signs and wonders no
[47:54] right you just see where you'll stay
[47:56] with a word or not
[47:59] right
[48:02] what does it matter about the signs and
[48:04] wonders because what has that got to do
[48:06] with the coming of the Lord
[48:10] when we've just read
[48:12] that in the last days the last two
[48:14] thousand years then what would it be
[48:19] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[48:24] your sons and your daughters will
[48:27] prophesy my handmaids my people
[48:30] right around said it was poured out upon
[48:33] all people
[48:36] but where's the message
[48:43] where's the message that goes with it
[48:48] well I I didn't know we had to have him
[48:50] actually I thought we had the message
[48:54] well if we've got the message why are we
[48:57] looking for signs
[49:00] hey come on folks don't look at me
[49:03] you know what I am and the way I stand
[49:05] we believe in signs and wonders in
[49:07] little Georgia we send the sick heal the
[49:10] dead Rays storms spoke out of existence
[49:13] rain brought into existence we've seen
[49:16] God move
[49:20] I've seen the angel of the Lord three
[49:23] times
[49:25] so God's standing in a church why would
[49:28] I worry about signs and wonders I saw
[49:31] that when I was 11 years old
[49:35] but you you tell them things like You're
[49:37] exalted I'm exalting Jesus Christ
[49:44] because that's the only one to do it
[49:46] because I didn't have anything to do
[49:47] with it coming
[49:52] but why is it that we're so unpopular
[49:59] it's because of the stand on the message
[50:04] right
[50:07] well I thought that was what it's
[50:08] supposed to be myself
[50:11] because I didn't know
[50:19] I'll give you that one word I can keep
[50:21] my word
[50:23] uh look at number nine brothers
[50:26] taken souls in prison because I used to
[50:29] quote this
[50:30] 1963 11 10 the morning service and I had
[50:33] a lot of other people quoting it because
[50:34] they were quoting me I guess
[50:37] and look what he says as an American one
[50:39] time when the enemy was about to take
[50:40] this country there's a man in the
[50:42] Midnight Hour jumped on a horse and rode
[50:45] down the road screaming the enemy is
[50:47] coming it was Paul Revere I am an
[50:50] American too and I'm writing this
[50:52] Midnight Hour not saying the enemy is
[50:55] coming but he's here he ain't coming
[50:58] he's already here he's done conquered
[51:04] hmm
[51:06] I used to quote that as the Holy Ghost
[51:08] but now like I said not to prop up
[51:10] nothing but remember
[51:13] Jesus comes before the enemy comes the
[51:16] enemy comes as an impersonator he
[51:19] doesn't come first he follows after God
[51:22] all right
[51:24] so now I can say for myself then
[51:27] I'm not saying he's coming
[51:30] I'm saying he's here
[51:32] now
[51:35] we'll get through in a hurry tonight
[51:40] because you wonder maybe why I read in
[51:42] the book of Acts
[51:50] about the outpouring of the holy spirit
[51:52] in the last days
[51:57] we just remember
[52:00] and I'll be glad to give you the quotes
[52:01] they're laying in the office
[52:04] Peter got up and he said
[52:07] this is that
[52:10] it was promised
[52:14] a Joel
[52:17] brother random says this is that
[52:22] talking about the Holy Ghost and coming
[52:25] into life days and pouring out upon All
[52:27] Flesh
[52:28] this is that that was spoken of by the
[52:31] prophet
[52:36] why can't you and I say this is that
[52:42] I'm not looking for his coming
[52:45] now you know what I'm talking about I'm
[52:47] not talking about a physical coming I'm
[52:50] not talking about what will happen to
[52:52] the Jews or whatever happens here or
[52:54] there I'm talking about what your
[52:56] Prophet gave that we've given over and
[52:58] over and even one of them's in the
[53:00] future home
[53:01] where he says
[53:04] he comes three times
[53:06] he said he come one
[53:09] to redeem the bride he comes the second
[53:12] time with his bride he comes the third
[53:14] time in the millennium
[53:20] the Millennium is a physical coming
[53:23] and we come back with him
[53:28] but I'm concerned with that part we're
[53:32] and what is the sign of thy coming
[53:37] a sign of the son of man
[53:42] the resurrection sign
[53:46] not going to go back and
[53:48] say something without you thinking it's
[53:50] all exalted
[53:52] you've heard it over and over and most
[53:53] of you know what I'm fixing to say my
[53:56] heart
[53:57] and I could have you to quote it for me
[53:59] that the first sermon I preached in 1969
[54:02] was the Bride of Jesus Christ would be
[54:05] the son of man
[54:12] well because you'll be the word made
[54:14] flesh that will be his second coming
[54:18] to take her away
[54:22] if he's not coming physically but we'll
[54:25] become visible Among Us
[54:29] and there is a difference in the
[54:30] appearing in the coming
[54:36] as I said he can appear right over in
[54:38] here in this church right over there and
[54:41] heal the sit and do great things
[54:44] we'll learn to talk to him about to go
[54:46] yeah one day you
[54:48] know Eastern Sky split and we'll hear a
[54:50] trumpet we'll hear the
[54:54] if you don't believe that's right Go Out
[54:56] Among the people of the message and see
[54:58] what they're looking for
[55:03] I told you I talked to a man the other
[55:04] day if he hears this he knows what I
[55:07] said
[55:08] he said you're not looking for him the
[55:12] Rapture is not going that way to you and
[55:13] I said no it ain't Rapture is coming
[55:16] this way
[55:17] he said I never saw that until
[55:20] you know well
[55:22] I wonder how many people are still
[55:25] thinking about a Rapture is going away
[55:32] you got to have
[55:34] the coming of the Lord
[55:38] in his second stage
[55:42] of his coming
[55:44] to take his bride away before you can
[55:47] talk about a rapture
[55:56] so let me say it
[55:59] I've been laying there this morning
[56:01] thinking
[56:02] Lord how did I go with this
[56:05] Where'd I go tonight
[56:11] scripture come into my mind said
[56:14] this is that
[56:19] now I'll say this away
[56:22] if this ain't that
[56:24] leave me alone I'm happy with this
[56:29] and when that gets here I'll be ready
[56:32] but if we're not in what's taking place
[56:34] now we will not be ready
[56:38] the prophet said being in the wrong
[56:40] rights that the Rapture would be no
[56:43] excuse
[56:47] 40 something years ago
[56:50] right in that area I said the biggest
[56:52] portion of the people of this message
[56:54] will die and go by the grave
[57:00] I don't have to say that I'm cruel on
[57:01] that tonight I'll just let the people in
[57:04] the congregation
[57:05] how many of you remember me saying that
[57:08] over 40 years
[57:11] uh would you mind letting raise your
[57:14] hand and let them scan and let's look at
[57:16] you and see how many of you heard me say
[57:19] that the biggest portion of people is
[57:21] going to die and go by the grave
[57:24] amen so you scan it around and see
[57:28] so it's not a statement tonight
[57:35] I'm not degraded nobody with that
[57:37] statement either because I've always
[57:39] explained
[57:40] that if you got the new birth you're
[57:43] going to be there
[57:44] you're going down go by the grave but
[57:46] you're going to be there
[57:48] you're going to be raised
[57:51] you're going to be brought forth
[57:54] not a degrading to nobody but a simple
[57:57] statement of fact
[58:01] why
[58:03] because if I don't have Rapture and
[58:05] faith I can't be standing there at the
[58:07] time is required
[58:11] I would miss what's going away
[58:14] if I don't see what's here I cannot talk
[58:17] about what's there
[58:18] how many years ago was it 10 years ago
[58:21] matching pieces
[58:23] 19 and 95.
[58:27] going on 20 years and I preached the
[58:29] series called matching pieces
[58:33] and I said when we match Revelations 5.
[58:40] remember Revelations 5 there's
[58:43] 24 Elders 12 Apostles Trump patriotic
[58:46] so when we match what those ages and
[58:49] things
[58:50] it showed us dire and we're going to go
[58:54] but if we don't match it
[58:56] we're going by the grave
[58:59] because somebody has got to come to that
[59:02] place
[59:05] you see tonight I can say this is that
[59:11] this is what I've looked forward to for
[59:14] 45 years or more
[59:18] to be able to say
[59:21] he's here
[59:24] not that he's coming he's here
[59:28] because in that it's not a physical
[59:29] coming to say he's here
[59:31] it's a revealing of his word amen is
[59:36] just in case there was on internet don't
[59:39] want to follow that I'd ask you to
[59:41] listen to Sunday morning's message I
[59:43] might read a few quotes that you might
[59:46] not have read
[59:48] or you read over them
[59:52] of what his coming is
[59:57] what if we were looking for his coming
[59:58] and he's already come right
[1:00:09] what if that could take place
[1:00:16] see this is that
[1:00:20] it was spoken of by all the prophets
[1:00:24] because this is the ending up of all
[1:00:26] things
[1:00:28] there's not another age another time to
[1:00:30] come not another Prophet to be sent and
[1:00:32] those things
[1:00:34] so this is that
[1:00:38] but when we're going to start saying it
[1:00:43] and like I said if this ain't that leave
[1:00:46] me alone I'm happy
[1:00:49] because to me this is that right
[1:00:54] right that was spoke about
[1:00:59] not just
[1:01:00] just well all the prophets spoke of the
[1:01:03] coming of the Lord and the ending up of
[1:01:05] all things
[1:01:09] so this is that
[1:01:15] not looking for it to take place looking
[1:01:18] for more of it to come into
[1:01:19] manifestation yes
[1:01:22] and one day we will leave the Earth
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:27] because we go meet him in the air
[1:01:30] wow
[1:01:33] but I don't think we need to be worried
[1:01:35] about a spaceship right now
[1:01:41] because remember if we even talk about a
[1:01:44] spaceship
[1:01:46] make sure and I'm out quote to profit
[1:01:49] that you're pressurized
[1:01:53] you remember that
[1:01:58] you're getting a little airplane Ryan I
[1:02:01] like to ride in them
[1:02:03] but you get a pair of 500 feet or a
[1:02:05] thousand feet and look down it looks
[1:02:07] beautiful
[1:02:10] you can't go with a propeller driven
[1:02:12] plane but so high
[1:02:15] because the oxygen Runs Out
[1:02:20] and you got a problem
[1:02:23] well here come a jet
[1:02:26] for us to be able to just
[1:02:28] been up 42 000 feet
[1:02:31] I remember that that day and the guy
[1:02:32] said it was about 38 000 he said bad
[1:02:35] weather ahead we're going up little
[1:02:36] buddy come back on he said we're flying
[1:02:38] at 42 000 feet I thought that'd be a
[1:02:42] long ways to walk
[1:02:45] pretty Cloud down below you look like
[1:02:47] you can just step out on them I love it
[1:02:49] look out them windows and see
[1:02:51] looked like he just stepped from One
[1:02:52] Cloud to another
[1:02:56] but
[1:02:58] after all of that
[1:03:02] still wouldn't pressurize enough to take
[1:03:04] an outer space trip
[1:03:06] so the prophet said interplanetary
[1:03:08] travel is the top of the rapture
[1:03:12] them going to the moon was the top of
[1:03:13] the Rapture because it had to be
[1:03:15] pressurized
[1:03:16] and you got to stay pressurized
[1:03:21] because you turn that pressure off and
[1:03:23] what would happen
[1:03:24] I remember brother Tom far Bush he was a
[1:03:26] deep sea diver and a welder underneath
[1:03:29] the boats and things and had to be in no
[1:03:32] suits and uh
[1:03:34] the pressure and everything had to be
[1:03:36] just right
[1:03:37] he said if that pressure cuts off
[1:03:42] he said
[1:03:44] you will come up through that round hose
[1:03:56] they don't have no great big hoses
[1:03:58] cooked to them guys
[1:04:00] he said you obese come up just as
[1:04:02] nothing but blood and
[1:04:06] because the pressure's gone
[1:04:09] well
[1:04:10] that's the way it is without Jesus
[1:04:12] Christ
[1:04:13] but if we can get pressurized
[1:04:16] and get just right
[1:04:18] there'll be a rapture
[1:04:21] I believe that
[1:04:23] there'll be a coming of the Lord to
[1:04:24] Israel there'll be a coming of the Lord
[1:04:27] back to the Earth with a bride
[1:04:31] but I'm concerned with what's taking
[1:04:32] place right now
[1:04:35] this is that
[1:04:38] where you and I are living
[1:04:40] come on musicians
[1:04:43] let's stand
[1:04:44] this is that
[1:04:49] that was spoken of by all
[1:04:52] the prophets
[1:04:55] this is the end of all things
[1:05:02] and what are we doing
[1:05:04] well okay maybe I guess in a way
[1:05:08] member the MU is the one that said in a
[1:05:13] way
[1:05:14] remember that
[1:05:20] but you see I know and realize also one
[1:05:22] thing because I say tonight this is that
[1:05:25] some people will say this is that
[1:05:28] but I also know one thing if it's not
[1:05:31] revealed to you like it's revealed to me
[1:05:34] it's not that to you
[1:05:39] if you don't see where we're at what I
[1:05:41] say
[1:05:43] is Vine jangling words
[1:05:46] of what you think is exalted in
[1:05:51] you know trying to make something out of
[1:05:53] yourself
[1:05:57] but you know somebody's going to say it
[1:06:01] the prophet said when you begin to say I
[1:06:04] and my father are one and those other
[1:06:07] things
[1:06:08] he said to shook will pull away
[1:06:12] well let's at least get the other things
[1:06:16] all right
[1:06:19] what we got brother
[1:06:23] man
[1:06:24] anybody have a need
[1:07:10] thank you
[1:07:39] very about
[1:07:42] Hank and Martha Martin
[1:07:46] because they're in a lot of trouble I
[1:07:48] talked to him today
[1:07:50] and a lot of you don't know she tried
[1:07:53] Sunday night
[1:07:56] there's problems it's
[1:07:58] you know
[1:07:59] there's a lot of things a lot of trouble
[1:08:03] but
[1:08:05] he wants to help her and he's doing the
[1:08:07] best he can but he can't leave her
[1:08:11] because you know
[1:08:13] you just can't leave her I talked to him
[1:08:16] this morning and
[1:08:18] I worked with him two days in a row and
[1:08:20] she came and seemed to be doing better
[1:08:22] but see she's up and down
[1:08:25] and
[1:08:27] she's hindered him and he's hindering
[1:08:29] her and
[1:08:30] the whole thing just going wrong
[1:08:34] so let's believe
[1:08:35] she was diagnosed as schizophrenic and
[1:08:39] bipolar
[1:08:40] and got a lot of problems a lot of
[1:08:42] medication
[1:08:45] and just
[1:08:46] you know
[1:08:49] me maybe we can't even think about being
[1:08:52] that away but
[1:08:54] she can't help being what she is at the
[1:08:56] time because of that
[1:08:58] and we don't blame them I told her the
[1:09:00] other day I said
