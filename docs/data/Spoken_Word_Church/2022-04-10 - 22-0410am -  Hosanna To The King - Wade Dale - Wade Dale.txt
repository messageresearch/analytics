shall these things be which thou has provided [Music] and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat neither for the body what you shall put on it consider the raven for they neither soul nor reed which neither have still houses not bonds and god feeded them how much more are ye better than defiles if you then be not able to do that thing

like me preaching just listen to the first 15 minutes so you can get all the announcements i mean if you're going to be part of the church just saying amen i'm sorry but the truth we need to be christian people growed up not babies where you have to be laid around all over the place also may the 21st we have our youth service coming up uh june 18th we have come to um we don't have a father's day fishing trip planned because a lot of the venues were already taken up so we're going to go to terrence and zach and them on property oh good have a matinee back here with us but they have property over in banks county and they have a big pond it's not a little pond it's a big pond and we're gonna have a fishing day that day we're gonna take hot we're gonna do hot dogs hamburgers we're gonna take generators with lights and we'll take uh tents and you'll be able to fish there's a lot of brim a lot of bass and i don't know if you think catfish will not be calling catfish in it don't know but we'll try we haven't been over there fishing much but whatever we've done fishing zach caught a bunch the other day was over there by last year so we're going to do that june 18th father's day saturday all right also july the 3rd brother chris long will be with us there will not be a saturday service it's going to be one day sunday two services on sunday july the 3rd and then also remember keep this in your prayer july the 16th we want to have a youth service but we want to have it in ohio pretty big drive but it will be okay but we're going to talk about it and go up there and fellowship with them and i want to tell you something about you know how i feel about them and they're they're online watching now but uh um they had a uh wedding ceremony yesterday uh a couple got married there so we we pray just keep them in your prayer but you got a group of people that sometimes we sometimes we get settled in our ways and i know we got company here today but we're all family but we get settled in our ways and we think oh it's just brother so-and-so and brother sister and so our sister so-and-so but when you take a group of people that's made a choice bring that baby in here this rebecca good to see you that's her baby hey buddy yeah your seat's up here come on good to see you good to have you good to be here hey man there's a story behind that but i'll let her tell you that later on so the youth service we're going to try to have the reason i have a place in my heart for these people know how is they left a real comfortable place they left a church that was comfortable kind of like ours you got family and we had these we have these youth functions and we have all these eating things you can tell we're all kind of big but you know we have a church family and they they decided after listening not not just listening to us but listening to the ministry of this church they decided to leave where they were and they're 11 hours away so there's no way they can commute so they decided to just make the little church and you saw most of you saw that where we dedicated it a couple of weeks ago and listen if somebody's going to make an effort like that we ought to make an effort to make sure that it works we ought to we ought to nurture them we ought to i mean you know they're like i told them before the the wound is still raw but wounds wounds heal they scab over and you know sometimes you whack them again and they hurt again but i want us to to uh um welcome them with open arms and and uh they love the lord they love brother dale they love our ministry here at the church and we love them so i want us to make sure that that that that we stay connected with them and we help them as much as we can because they're up there um sitting now in a basement pretty little church but there's churches all around there that they could be going to and they chose not to do it because they like brother dale or may or brother bob or brother luis or brother aaron they like the word of god that's coming forth from this building amen they enjoy listening like i said before they they're you know like their dad brother uh enrique or richard he tells me he tells us things that we did you know 15 years ago that we've already forgot but they listened to our sermons religiously so they just have a place in our heart and we want to support them so on july the 16th if we have to fly or drive we're going to try to go up there and have a youth service and then we've uh they rented a venue where we can have about 40 or 50 people in it and we'll have a church service there on sunday so just keep in prayer that's a long time i mean that's july 16th um coming up we'll talk about that a little bit more uh brother joe and brother direct them they're on vacation good to have anna and all the different ones that we're gone got to have y'all back and good to be in the house of the lord so let's read let's turn to matthew today we're going to shift gears a little bit we're still going to be talking a little about the son of man but we want to today how many know today's palm sunday today's palm sunday that is the that is the starting of the holy week for christians heading up to easter this is today that jesus did something that he had never done before now he'd entered the temple many times but he was coming in a different way he was coming in with a position and some authority he was coming in to do a job the king was coming to fight a battle he was coming to fight for me and you this whole week he fought he fought satan in the garden he fought him in on the cross just for me and you so we don't have to fight him anymore amen so we're gonna talk a little bit the title today will be hosanna to the king amen matthew 21 verse 8 let's pray lord thank you for this day thank you for the things you give us thank you for giving us an opportunity to even be standing here lord talking to the purchased possession of your blood lord i pray that you just sanctify us for this journey lord thank you for giving brother bob the liberty this morning to speak father in the song service and the baby dedication and and our friends are there are here with us lord may may they see christ in all of us lord and as we speak about you lord you take over and you do the speaking father because without you here lord it would be just a meeting of of people lord but with you lord here there something will happen lives will be changed lord you've come this time of the year we we surely have a resurrection when every day if you're a christian but there's a time of of a week that you physically came on this earth and you died on a cross for us at calvary and we know that father because you rose from the dead and you live now in the hearts of the people so lord maybe may we respond today to that part that's inside of us lord and to respond back and say that ain't nothing but the truth and hosanna to the king lord just bless us and be with us in jesus name we pray amen let's read the scripture i know i've kept you standing too long but it keeps you from going to sleep matthew 21 verse 8 says a very great multitude spread their garments in the way and i'll tell you why there was a bunch of people there a little while others cut down branches from the trees that's why they call this palm sunday all right and there's a significance of that too branches from the trees and straw them in the way in other words they laid them down and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city wow all the city was moved now there was two groups that were moving and we'll talk about that in a minute there always is two groups but three groups brother brown says mate believer unbeliever true believer and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this he may be seated in the lord and his blessing to the reading of the word what have we been speaking on who is this son of man who is this person that's come that before the foundation of the world he was god almighty he was a creator he was the one that could roll galaxies off of his finger he was the one that said let there be light and let there be this whole world that we stand on there was that man now he's standing today in a group of people but he had to go to calvary he had to begin this week remember he rode into jerusalem on a donkey he rode into jerusalem on palm sunday and seven days later he rose in that same city and he didn't need a donkey he walked wherever he needed to go he traveled like a thought because he resurrected in a glorified condition he said all power in heaven and earth being given unto me amen we love the resurrection but let's continue on and look let's look in the hebrew lexicon about what this word hosanna means the word hosanna means to save to be saved to be delivered that what were they saying hosanna save me save me we need a savior to be liberated how many wants to be liberated today listen i'm gonna preach today we're not gonna do any teaching so you can say amen or hallelujah clap or whatever you want to do not loud i don't care do something be liberated be saved be delivered we all need deliverance today there's things in our life that we all need deliverance from amen and like brother bob said it's just it's a daily hacking away of the of the skin of the world and you say i can't do this no you can't right let him do it that's right he's the one who did all the work like brother bob said we need to what rest problem is we fight right that's right the problem is we fight he says rest we say no we got well what is our problem we we beat the problem if that is a that is a statement we be the problem and that's the problem we have now look but to be saved look in battle be victorious jesus was not he didn't just walk up to jerusalem to the gates and say i don't want to do this anymore it's too hard i don't want to come to church it's too hard i don't want to wear the right clothes it's too hard i don't want to say glory hallelujah and pray it's too hard no he didn't he said i'll come to take over i've come he said and what he said go find me a donkey and i'm gonna say donkey like brother brother uh who was that brother marcus becker he you don't use the word ass the whole time you know but the bible does say that but we're gonna say donkey but there's a significance about this donkey and the way he rode into jerusalem and i about had a religious fit when i saw anybody ever know what foal means we've read it a thousand two thousand times if you've read your bible he come in on the fall of a donkey we'll talk about that in just a second but he wrote in on sunday and he he rode in triumphant he wrote in and said i'm here he didn't shun the job he did the job he was supposed to do and he was headed toward calvary he knew there was something coming he knew he was going to die he knew that was the last trip he knew that was the last trip that he was ever going to go through those gates alive because he's going to die for me and you he didn't die for himself he died for us and we look at the crucifixion was on friday he was only just a few days away from that yes and remember we're going to read here in zechariah 9 just keep that in mind though to be saved in battle to be saved right now he came to fight a battle but zechariah had already talked about it in the old testament rejoice greatly o daughter of zion now who is the daughter of zion the bride of jesus christ that's us today if that's all right oh daughter of zion of jerusalem behold thy king cometh amen declaring king today if you're declaring king all those other things that go out of your life you declare him to be the king that's right sure we all have issues but listen we can't dwell in the past three unclean spirits like frogs look backwards yeah all right that's right we don't want to look backwards you know what it is is you're not believing that god can do what he said he would do we throw it in the sea of god's forgetfulness he throws it in there then we go fishing stay out of that water it's a sea of forgetfulness don't go digging don't go fishing don't go throwing a nap back out there and see what you can pull back in i have to believe standing here today in this pulpit i've done things in my life that's totally unworthy that i shouldn't be right here today but god has cleaned me up if god cleans you up if god will clean you up then yes sir you can do now there's things that you can't do there's things that that we have we know that there's grace but we know it's not greasy grace we know we have to come to a process of justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost we'll talk about that more this afternoon brother bob hit it this morning which is wonderful that we don't talk to each other but we preached basically the same thing you know and we come together and on sunday and let god talk to us regardless of whether he was sitting and coming last night getting his message and i was sitting in gillsville getting mine god was still there doing something amen so we must believe that and that's what i have to put my belief in that god cleaned me up that god gave me the holy ghost and if he didn't give me the holy ghost i want it so bad till i don't want to do nothing else but have it amen but he promised he'd give it to us we've been talking about promises so here's this man he's he's not coming up to the to the city and and being a prophet being god almighty and human flesh he knew what he was heading toward but he didn't shun his responsibility he died for those people that said hosanna save us we need salvation thou son of david behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon a donkey and upon a cult the foal of a donkey now we're gonna pick this apart a little bit it looks like he's riding on two donkeys but he's not he's riding on the little donkey he can't ride in on his mama's coattail he's riding on the sun hmm rejoice oh oh daughter of zion he's going to ride upon a donkey and we will see we'll read what jesus told him to do upon a cult the foal of a donkey remember he was a burden bearer remember he was a type of the scapegoat you had one goat that was sacrificed and one goat that the scent the what the the blood was put on that scapegoat and was sent out into the desert that's what i'm saying that's our problem we don't believe that our sins got took away our problem is we go hunting that goat where are you supposed to not hunt the goat leave the goat alone leave your sins alone i mean come on people good grief we got to get over ourselves first i was reading well i was listening something the other day where brother brown was talking about it said so brother brown said that demon came back on her and you know what he said he said it did because she loved it legion hated his demons and god cast them out and they didn't come back according to the bible he was in his sound mind that's our problem our problem is is we like them can i talk a little bit today you say no brother i hate them they torment me no you don't hate them enough and listen we all got them listen there's no itty bitty demons and no biggie biggie demons it's all unbelief yeah i said biggie biggie it's all unbelief it's all what you can believe that god has done for you not that god sent a prophet in the end time we're not even going to talk about the message today we're talking about what god did for us so this is a holy week not a holy week for a seventh angel messenger he wasn't god god's want to save my soul but god had to send us a prophet amen god had to send us a prophet because we were so confused we were like that mixed multitude some of them threw down the palms some of them threw down their their jackets and said hosanna to the king but where were they at the crucifixion where were they at the judgment hall there were some that believed maybe secret believers they said about you know nicodemus and the different ones but there was some people that the bible tells us that even the disciples didn't understand what was going on until after god had come back in in uh the baptism of the holy ghost and entered into those into those men because you know what they were there when jesus rode in and they ran away from him too so let's go to matthew 21 verse one now let's read the story kind of shift gears a little bit today and when they drew nine to jerusalem it would come to beth page until the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find a donkey tide and a cult with her that was her child that was the son loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say all unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them straightway he will send them and all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet we just read it in jeremiah tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon a donkey in a cult the fall of a donkey you know what that word fall means look at it son of man his son son of david all of them all the names turn a man son of god son of david my beloved son why it was the son of a mother donkey everybody with me he was identifying who he was yes he was the son of man he was the one riding in i never knew what that word fold mean meant it's f-o-a-l foal the fall of a donkey which means the son of man i want to read the rest of it i don't know what just happened but we need that back up there because i want you to listen to what man okey-dokey go all the way down to 1a this is coming from this is coming from strong to quarters i want you to read this rarely used for the young of animals so it wasn't even supposed to be used to identify a young donkey generally of the offspring of men and in a restricted sense the male offspring one born of look born by a father and of a mother i said exactly the way it's supposed to be one born by a father and of a mother amen amen term describing man carrying the connotation of weakness and mortality i want you to watch this one right here number three used by christ himself they talk about son of man talk about the son of man all right doubtless in order that he might intimate his messiahship and also that he might designate himself as the head of the human race the king in other words the man he was riding into jerusalem identifying himself as the flesh king [Music] oh jehovah had been king jehovah had been god in the old testament but all they saw was a cloud all they saw was smoke all they saw was every once in a while a light would go across or they they knew that the preacher would go back behind the holy of holies and he would do what he's supposed to do and the shekinah glory would fall but he would only fell on one person god's fixing to walk through this place that would call jerusalem through that arch and say here i am yes amen i'm riding on the very thing that i am amen i am the son of man and i'm riding on the fall man that's right continue yeah i thought he's pretty good too and he also might designate himself as the head of the human race the man look the one who both furnished the pattern of the per you can't make that stuff up the one who furnished the pattern of the perfect man and acted on behalf of all mankind amen he died for every person but he knew only a certain group would take him christ seemed to have to prefer preferred this to the other masonic titles remember son of god son of david they called him all different things no he was the son of man he was god in human flesh christ seems to have preferred this to other messiah titles because by its loneliness it was at least suited to foster the expectation of an earthly messiah in royal splendor that was god in human flesh that went into that city let's continue and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the cult or brought them the mama and the cult that's that's what the scripture's saying and putting on them their clothes and they set him their own now it's not clear which one they set him on but john will tell you exactly they set him on the little one because he was the son of man and that was the son of that of that donkey and a very great multitude spread their garb where was those multitudes at on crucifixion day where was that crowd on resurrection morning where was that crowd that was at judgment hall that happened happens a lot everything you know we get this zeal and we get this new feeling and we get this new i like brother branham talks about him um talks about sanctification everybody thinks in sanctification man i got the holy ghost because i feel this i've quit doing this i've quit doing no that you just had the unclean spirit tore out of you but remember there's the door still open amen the house it left the door's still there and if you don't close it by the baptism of the holy ghost satan will come back into the house and he will bring seven demons more wicked than him more religious than he is and he'll set you in church and say i don't do this and i don't do that right so i must be right some brother bob was talking about huh it's got to be a love affair no do's and don'ts people think we're weird no i we're going to cover something a little bit this afternoon we we've got to be separated from the world folks the world has got to be able to tell we are different because this man right here this son of man was he normal was he just well i'm part of this crowd and i'm part of the pharisees and i love you sadducees i love you pharisees we got the same father we come from the same place no he never told him that he said you come from one place and i come from another you came from the devil because that's your daddy and my daddy's from above he separated himself remember i told you sure he is the prince of peace the mighty god the everlasting father but he stood up one day and said i come to bring a sword yes i come to divide families up because if you don't accept jesus christ as your savior i don't care if my kids don't do that they're separated from me but we're claiming our kids we know that listen we don't draw anybody out it's your free will choice to decide if you want jesus christ to be in your life or not amen i was thinking yesterday just for a minute you know when we were 14 15 16 maybe even 20 years old did you think about dying you had a thousand years to live thousands of years you had to live neither don't smile you could just i mean man end of life don't talk to me about that you get 62. and 80. you know if if even if time goes on you ain't got but about five or six good years if you get up in that region everybody with me i'm 62. in 20 years i'll be 82. that ain't nothing right right so you start thinking about it later on in your life things that didn't bother you back there it bothers you now thinking about your humanity well what are you saying brother wade get born again tomorrow may not come you get right with god now tomorrow may not come and then what are you going to do then god's going to say i'll give you an opportunity amen let's get back to this king everybody all right amen you love the lord it's an exciting time sure it's horrible for the world it's but it's exciting time for us i you know i don't i don't worry about stock market i don't worry about i don't worry about you know the the interest rates going up and all that stuff why what are you going to be able to do about it but god's give you give you provision to make it through he didn't say remember like i was telling you last sunday everybody thinks boy once you become a preacher once you become a preacher your grass quits growing never have to cut it and when you become a preacher your bills stop coming in huh people brings you food and you just don't ever have to go buy food you're just so in love with you your wife you and your wife never have an issue all that just goes away no all that just begins y'all ever remember playing dog pile of you don't you kids are going is that a video game no it's not a video game it's reality it was called dog pile and you piled up on top of somebody thank god aaron wasn't my friend just saying but we used to play dog pile that's what happens when you stick your hand up and you say i'm a christian satan brings his dog pile friends with him and they dog pay you but you know what there's one greater than him this guy right here that walked through those streets of jerusalem he said i have come to take over you might think this is my worst hour you might think world that you're killing me you might think world that i've lost all my friends know i'm fixing to make a lot more i'm fixing to have some children i'm fixing to have somebody that loves me so much so they're going to give up their own life [Music] to have me i love you everybody all right he never said a word when he walked in jerusalem he didn't have to there was one crowd shouting hosanna to the king one brother brown many times he said one of them had old um rotten fruit thrown at him you always got the two groups you already got the ones that says man he's coming to save us and then we hate this guy and if you're a true christian the world's gonna say we hate this guy because we're not normal i don't want he brought the donkey and the colt put on the clothes and they sent him their own and a great multitude spread their garments in the way now this is a signification of a king coming in a king's parade the people would always stand outside and they would throw palm trees and they would throw whatever flowers and their and their cloaks they would throw down because in honor of a king coming through the city that's what they were doing but that same crowd five days later said let his blood be on us and our children and they hung him on a cross and the very great multitudes spread their garment in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitude that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this have you ever moved the city have you ever moved a room you walk into a room and something happens you walk into the room and somebody says something's different showed up have you ever the whole city was moved because this one guy and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee now that was one interpretation and jesus went into the temple of god now look here's the prince of peace he walks into the temple and he plants a rope takes him about 15 or 20 minutes because he's sitting there plating it he was watching he was watching them dishonor the word of god in his house hello somebody is he planting a rope this morning come on that's your choice and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables he didn't just go in there and say look y'all don't need to be doing that he was cleaning house the prince of peace was doing that some people they they have a bad conception even of us they think man we all just let everybody run all over us and and you know no no no no no you stand on the word of god because look he's fixing to quote them scripture amen and he said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them verse 15 and when the chief preached now see now here's the religious people showed up hosanna to the king outside inside the chief priest saw the wonderful saw the wonderful things that he did saw it witnessed it have you witnessed the wonderful things god's done in your life or somebody else's life and turn away from it or call it billy bob that's what they're doing to him when the chief i hope this hit somebody right in the head me and the children cried in the temple and said hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased the religious people of the world that was the most religious people in the world the most religious place in the world was in that temple and they were calling that man or saying that they were so displeased with what those people were saying about them how about me and you and say unto him hearst now what they say and jesus says him yea have you never heard that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise amen let's go to one more let's go to john 12 this is a another um you know you have matthew mark luke and john they held have different commentaries this is john's commentary on the same thing that happened now what's happening here we let's let's make sure we understand what's happening this is the sunday before now this is palm sunday they don't the the sabbath is on their saturday so they're over with the sabbath everybody with me this is the first day of the week this is palm sunday that he's coming into the temple or coming into jerusalem and what's happening is why there's so many people there is because passover is the next sunday i mean saturday passover's the next saturday that's their big that's their big uh celebration that what happened in the uh israel or not israel egypt remember the passover they had to kill the lamb they had to eat it with their shoes on and their staff in their hand because the next day they were going out of egypt amen same way with me and you are you ready to get out of egypt i'm ready to get out of egypt and on the next day much people that will come to the feast what the feast of passover now what happened to passover they killed the lamb what are they fixing to do right before the passover on saturday of this same week they're going to kill the lamb they're going to kill jesus so they took branches of the palm trees and went forth to meet him crying hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord and jesus when he had found a young cult set there on and that is written fear not daughter of zion behold the king coming sitting on a donkey's colt all right everybody okay with that that was the foal these things understood not his disciples at the first didn't know why this man why is he calling for a donkey not the mother she probably was bigger wants the cold because they had to be a son he had to ride in on on his revelation that he was the son he was the son of man these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him that they had done these things unto him the people therefore that was with him when they called lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead bare record for this cause the people also met him for they had heard that he had done this miracle now the pharisees shows up the pharisees therefore said among themselves proceed perceive you how you prevail nothing behold the world has gone after him and there were certain greeks among them that came to worship at the feast same came therefore philip which was a bethesda of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus now we know brother brown preached many sermons on that sir we would see jesus they had heard about him they wanted to see him philip cometh and tell us andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus now watch i brought this part in because look this is what jesus is saying right after he came into jerusalem everybody with me all right don't fall asleep on me and jesus answered him saying the hours come i've walked into my arena i've walked into my place of fighting satan you chose this place that's all right but i'm gonna die on that same hill that i created the same tree that i created you're going to put me on it but that's okay i've got a job to do the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen i'm going to take a handful of seed probably one day next week if it'll ever warm up a little bit i'm gonna take a little bag full of seed i'm gonna plant probably 100 uh corn plants and you know what's going to happen there's going to be probably a million other seeds or corn that's going to come from that because it's going to make a stalk with two cobs and there's several hundred on each cob out of one seed so that's what jesus was saying i gotta die so that you can live i gotta die so that i can multiply even though i am the king even though i'm telling you i'm doing everything i'm supposed to do you're going to turn me down he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it under what life eternal if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honor hallelujah now is my soul troubled the very deep part of him now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour because he was a human but for this cause came i unto this hour father glorify thy name now what's the name of the father is father name his son or name his holy ghost the name he said why brother i'm to take matthew 28 19 because that's what jesus said jesus said exactly what acts 2 38 says he said be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost what's the name of the father next week boy class participation but father glorify thy name listen jehovah gyra wasn't his name nope jehovah wasn't his name amen god had only one name and that's jesus christ and he's the lord and why did christian baptism why is it always in the bible the name of jesus christ you say well that seems contrary um you know we got jesus talking over here and we got we got peter talking over here well now listen jesus didn't have keys that peter did because jesus said peter i've given to you the keys to the kingdom and whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i loose in heaven so peter on the day of pentecost he had the key and he knew the revelation that father is not a name son is not a name and he always was talking about the father having a name i come in my father's name what's his father's name jesus christ so peter says all right repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost when we baptize our brother and sister next sunday it's going to be a killing we're going to a funeral somebody's going to die we're going to put them down in burial we're going to bring them up in newness of life but we're not going to we're not going to put them in that water in a dead name we're not going to put them in that in that grave with titles right father's not a name son is not a name go silent chad just says i'm a father so i'll just sign father the bank will call you back and say what's your name amen that's why we baptize the name lord jesus christ we don't do it contrary to the scripture we do it because the scripture tells us to do it amen it is written it is written that's right we're the only one that to me that's the only christian baptism you get the others are titles and you don't have a promise the bible says it gives you the holy ghost if you're getting baptized the name of jesus christ so i want to tell you if anybody else next sunday wants to be baptized we're going to have a baptismal servant if anybody else wants to be baptized again you say i always baptized when i was a kid well you know what so was i but i got re-baptized just to make sure i wanted to show that i was doing it doing it right in my conscience and what is it is to tell the world that i am a christian and my water baptism doesn't save me no no no but it does put you in the right direction to receive the baptism of the holy ghost is everybody okay with that i got off on the rabbit trail sorry if a man served me let him follow me and where i am there shall be al be servant be if a man serve me him will my father honor now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came onto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again what's the name of the son of man jesus christ they crucified him and killed him he came back on the day of pentecost as the son of god but at the end time he's got to come back as the son of man again the lord jesus christ the correct baptism the correct no trinitarian doctrine and all these different things that that everybody else preaches it's not even in the bible amen the word purgatory is not even in the bible eternal hell not him in the bible but my mama told me that well your mama was wrong don't talk about my mama i ain't talking about you mama talking about the devil that was in here some of y'all don't know that do you who lies the devil and if the devil said it he's lying i don't care who he said it through yeah i say it preach it brother preach it all right we got one more thing and then we'll then we'll close right here i'll try not to be i'm going to cut some of this out why did they use palm branches this is considered palm sunday he said well by the way that's all they had all they had was palm trees no they had a lot of other different kind of trees they had fig trees but they picked up palm trees so let's go to nehemiah eight first fourteen everybody okay this is gonna be just kind of light today simple we got company today so tonight this afternoon we'll we'll we'll grill some steak it's pretty good steak to me already i like a little chopstick every once in a while you know all right nehemiah 8 verse 14 and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth into the mountain fetch olive branches pine branches myrtle branches palm branches and branches of thick trees to make boosts does everybody know where i'm going with this so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths everyone upon the roof of his house and in their court in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the watergate and in the street of the gate of ephraim why was that used what was that what were they doing it was the feast of tabernacles they were told to make bowels of trees and take them and put them together and make a booth and go sit in it so what were they doing they were putting palm leaves out they were testifying that that was god in the temple not the great temple that they were looking at over there it was god in that temple right there everything jesus did had some kind of significance everything every move he made was some kind of a type and a shadow well the type of this is god dwelling in a temple they were they were testifying hosanna god save us in human flesh god you i know you got to come there but they never said that they didn't get a revelation of it they just got caught up in the act they just got caught up into and so i guess we say in the end time into hoopla we got caught up they got caught up in the moment but what was the end result they still killed him they killed god in a human flesh they killed god in a temple oh no that temple that temple we've been what do you mean three days you're going to tear it down it took us 49 years to build that temple out in the world can you take it down in three days and raise it back up what kind of man are you he wasn't talking natural he was talking spiritually talking about this temple about this body god doesn't care about this building out here today he doesn't care how big of a building you build in the temple the big uh cathedrals and all those different things god don't care one thing about that god told us in the end time that he would dwell in human flesh he would dwell in your temple and you would be an outer court you'd be an inner court and you'd have a holy of holies down inside of you there's a soul that nobody can get to but satan and god if you don't have god there you got the devil there i'm sorry if you're not a child of god this morning you're a child of the devil and you do what he says oh no yeah you do i did yes i did i listened to him more than i listened to god that's what got me in trouble all right but you're a tabernacle even though you're a human being god wants to use your tabernacle he wants to ride into your tabernacle he wants to go into your holy of holies and he wants to give you all these blessings and all these symbols that we've looked at all on that whole week coming up to to um to easter sunday it was a significance because you know what folks you got to let him in your kingdom first you gotta let him into your jerusalem first you got to pronounce him king of kings you've got to lay the palm vows down and say god i know where you're at but i god won't do you any good if you know where he's at there out there i know right where god's at well then that means you're somewhere else what about say god's here i know where god's at today god's residing in this person today whether you like it or not whether i got on the right kind of clothes that you the color you need for me to wear of course i wear nice clothes i buy my own clothes so i'll wear a nice cloth but god wants to dwell in your flesh more than you want him to more than you want him to he wants to do more for you but here we are the week of the holiest week of the year now we as christians we have a holy week every week but let's just bring it and squeeze it into this week coming up we've got a service coming up friday saturday and sunday that we've never had before a three-day service like that with people coming in but you know what let's don't make it a drudgery let's make it as those people were putting those palm trees down and they were watching this scene unfold we know as bride that was the headstone that was the man of the hour he wasn't the second person of a trinity right right he was god because they were identifying him as a king if he was a king was that man god something else no that was king that was king god i'll read a couple quotes and then we'll close right here prophet of god says and god provided way in connersville indiana i'll read just a couple of quotes because once you listen to come some of this the prophet of god said look certainly god has a provided way now remember he didn't come in the back door he came in the gates of jerusalem to proclaim who he was but now remember that was going to be the roughest week he'd ever had in his life he was going to die he wasn't going to come back through those gates again alive he was going to be dead way back before there was a world that shouted religion where was you god said to job when i laid the foundation of the world when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy amen have i got something new no he's talking about his religion it's still the same hallelujah no wonder when that stone came rolling into jerusalem all the people singing hosanna hosanna and them stark's priest said make them holy peace oh y'all don't say amen just nod your head like some of y'all do you know what jesus said remember even john john was standing on the river and he said you can be quiet if you want to he said but the rocks will start shouting if you don't the bare rocks on this ground will start shouting if you don't start shouting the victory that the headstone or the head man or the king has walked into your house into your habitation all right brother brown said in blind bartimaeus he said oh this was a mixed multitude he said but here came the very captain of the host the very captain of the host away with him away with him some say same way with some of us away with him i don't need i don't know don't tell me how to live i'm not read the bible because if you're a christian that's what you used to live by if you choose to live by the world's books just continue on that way because you're going to go to hell right i'm sorry oh no i'm good they're going to be a lot of good people in hell actually a whole bunch of good people is going to be in hell i don't want to be good i don't want to stand before the white throne judgment and be judged by what i am and what i did that's why you get the holy ghost and this man i'm talking to you about right here in pilates hall and took your judgment he got on a cross to take your judgment now i can say put it all on him because he said put it all on me he said bring me your heavy burdens and i'll give you rest he said oh get that yolk off of you and put it on me even if there is a yolk on you it's gonna be so light you won't even know it's on yeah you won't even know us damn that's the man i'm talking about but there's always a mixed multitude and there he was you hypocrite there's nothing to you some of them hollered hosanna oh a mixed multitude but along there came who the very captain of the host he had become human flesh that had met joshua isn't he the captain of the host he was the angel of the covenant now look all those are titles and positions that one man held jesus christ so why would you want to be baptized any other way i'm a dale because i was born in dale i took the name of dale but i am a father i am a son and i'm a human being but my name is not father son or human being that's why we baptized correct baptism according to acts 2 38 why did peter say that if god gave him the keys he went god wasn't up there going give me the key back give me keep back give me keep back right now he's up there going open the door peter stick that thing in that door and open it cause i need to get down there and then a group of people and give the holy ghost angel the covenant the pillar of fire and here he was again when the people are shouting the days of miracles has passed all hope is gone here comes the captain of the host of the lord coming by just on time he always arrives just right he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something has to take place yes sir something has to take place let's just stop right there let's read let's go to the very last one let's read it only a prophet could tell a story like this you know even brother adam brings blind bartimaeus he said he was there during all that was when that was going on how do you know that number seven or no seven seven there you go what is the attraction on the mountain now it had been a very weary nervous day if you're having a nervous day today enter into this story if you're having trouble today enter into this story all right this story was told for your example today god set you in this poop in this place today he set you in that pew today to listen to this sermon now what are you going to do with it are you going to shout hosanna to the king are you going to say crucify him all right now been a very weary nervous day it was an unusual day we find jesus coming to jerusalem ready to attend the passover and the passover is where the paschal lamb was killed and the blood was spread upon the mercy seat for the atonement for the people and he had come up from beth podge and had come to the top of the mount of olives which looked down upon a little hill where jerusalem was built and he looked and knowed that was his final visit that was his final visit and a human being with human eyes that was his final visit he wasn't going to visit that place anymore this was the time that when he would be delivered into the hands of sinful man and they would kill him he would die the horriblest death that was ever died by immortal and be buried he would be betrayed by his own some of them standing right with him and him being god knew what was in their heart and knew from the beginning who would betray him and knowed what man was with him who set by his side and counted his money and so forth know that man would betray him knew that a cruel roman cross waited for him out there he knew that his water in his body and his blood of his body would separate and that the blood would drop off of his forehead great big drops like perspiration and he knew all that was before him and he stands up on the mountain looking over jerusalem and i'll finish the story and he turns and walks into the city he says go get me a donkey because i'm going to identify who i am the people are going to love me but the people are going to hate me but i'm going toward jerusalem i'm headed to that place knowing that i'll never stand on this mountain again that this is going to be my final visit but thank god it wasn't his final visit to human beings it was not his final visit to human beings he was standing in one place god almighty and human flesh now he's gone almighty in many human fleshes all over the world he has multiplied himself because palm sunday looked bad it looked horrible for this man called jesus he was having all kind of issues and troubles and trials he said even father let this cup pass from me i just don't want to do this in my humanities but nevertheless i got to go do what i got to do i've got to go die for these people let's stand to our feet i've got to go die for these people i'm not coming back to jerusalem i've made my last visit what if today this is your last visit what if today is the last time you walk into this place oh i'm healthy brother wade huh you'd be dead in 15 minutes you could take your last breath but you know what if you've got your faith and your hope on the one that did take his final breath but he wasn't one that stayed dead he come out of that tomb he said all power and heaven earth has been given unto me i have destroyed death i have taken death hell in the grave and i have buried it in that same seed that i'm going to forgive you your sins for and put your sins in the sea of god forgetfulness listen folks move forward we got to jesus was always moving forward he never took and went back the other way he never retreated he never walked up to a funeral and said i don't know if i can do this or not no every funeral he went to there was a resurrection jesus never attended a funeral it all became a resurrection after he got there amen so that man where is he today he's right here he's inside of each one of us and all of you need to believe that he wants to talk more than you want to talk hey man he wants to talk through you he wants to identify that he's walked into your temple triumphant the prophet of god said in daniel 70 weeks he said jesus messiah wrote into the city of jerusalem triumphant on the back of a white white mule on palm sunday april the 2nd 80 30 to die for me and you never had to ride a donkey anymore didn't have no did not have to have transportation he could travel like a thought but he was still a human he can be felt by your infirmities he can be felt by your sins and your attitude that we have and all the different things that we display that he's not happy with but you know what he's not going to do away with you he's here to forgive you he's not here to condemn you he's here to forgive you who does a condemning i do you do you do the condemning you condemn yourself because you have to live with yourself you can put on a facade if you want to but there's two people that know what's going on god and the devil and if we can shut the devil out we can let god do his job let's sing a song god bless you hosanna to the king he's here today he showed up [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh glory to his name oh god that was that name again glory to the name not your title not to a holy father that i pray to we pray to the lord jesus christ we pray to the god of glory o glory to his name oh i am so wondrously saved from sin jesus so sweetly abides within there at the cross where he took me [Music] glory to his name oh glory to his name [Music] [Applause] glory to his wonderful name there to my heart [Music] real quick everybody bow your head everybody close your eyes [Music] we don't do this much but i feel today we should you don't have to come up here if you got something in your life [Music] the prophet of god told us we break all [Music] theories of gravity when we raise our hands there has to be something to help behind that hand to be raised so if you got an issue this morning or something in your heart if you're searching for god or if you have a physical problem if you'll just raise your hand to god and say god i'm i'm done i'm done i'm i'm tired i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired this world doesn't have anything for me it's dragging us down it's pulling us to the pits of hell [Music] but lord with our hands up we pray lord that you will see these hands and lord that you'll just be with each one father this is a week coming up
