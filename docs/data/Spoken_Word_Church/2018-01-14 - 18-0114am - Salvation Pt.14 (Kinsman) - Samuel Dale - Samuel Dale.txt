he's in a church they're ministering today probably timewise not exactly with us but remember him ministering and in flying back on Wednesday Joyce gave us a notes in Danny was having trouble with his nose bleeding this more so let's just pray and remember that I said when he lived was that he's doing better so let's pray that the Lord will we'll take all of that away and and everything to get rid of that part of it okay Oh anything else that we have father we thank you for your grace and your light and your love thank you for you cause without you what good it would be even any of us Lord we praise your great name and your honor and glory and everything that we could put we would give to you because we know that's who we worship and who we want to be lifted up and guided by and Lord lead us through the times in the days we know it the days are getting closer and things are worrying away so just come and manifest yourself have your way be with Dany's our Lord his nose bleeding this morning and just touch him and take away that problem with it and all the others that are sick among us there's many many sicknesses you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you have your way now forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace in Jesus name now I'm putting in I was going to go ahead and get started on the point of the the new birth but you know we're still on it and trying to bring that point out but what we're doing good to see sister Jean there with us that's what I got it right here or written down sister Jean this is good to see sister Jean back what I was looking over all the other failed to get to it'd be good to see but we're trying to I'm trying to get a kind of a foundational point that it doesn't sound like it in what I'm bringing in things but once we start in to talking about the new birth I believe you'll see why this is so valuable to get us into a position because like we've said over and over you can't take salvation Redemption whatever in the Old Testament and have it one way and then come in the New Testament and have it another way you got to have if you want to call it anything I guess the best way I could say it is each one is a further advancement until the finish of that and the Lord willing next Sunday I'll try to bring this to an overall message to show you what we're doing and then we'll drop back and pick it up but just remember the point now you can't have an Old Testament salvation one way you know it's by this or you know I'm just saying points you know that it would be by because you would believe and do this and then get over the New Testament and you got to make it something else it's got to be the same it's just further advancing from the Old Testament to the New Testament it's further advancement see the New Testament starts exactly kameena and this is where I put it and the way I believe it the New Testament salvation will start exactly where we've left off as the Old Testament of what it is and what's it based upon believing believing all right so then we put the New Testament to start right on that and we'll go right on that okay all right so that should get us a start I want you to keep that in your mind all right Jonah 2 and 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will play that that that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spoken to the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry upon the land trial and all right now we're going to go into the Book of Ruth to pick up the kinsman part because this is very vital to tie the old with the new all right because it's got to be that he's got to be the Keystone right Jesus Christ is the Keystone from the old to the new he fits in without that you wouldn't have any hopes whatsoever save reading let's just go to about two root three and eight and we'll just read a few verses to get our thought and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth Don handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as now followers not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to the all that thou requires requires for all of the city of my people doesn't know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thy near kinsman howbeit there is one near then I carry this not and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsman's part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning you may be seated for that is blessing to the reading of the word now you know that we'd be dealing then with the kinsman our kinsman redeemer our kin folks all right so if there's going to be a salvation that would come into being you know and bringing it into light we need to wedge a message in to think about the kinsman redeemer or the kinsman is what I put on it because that's just a a point because it's not just the kinsman redeemer he does the redeeming part but there's other things that transpire you know and we get all of the things in line and trying to go and I was thinking while I was studying on this a little about the the situation that took place with Ruth and Boaz do you realize that by the point of Boaz taking Ruth to be his wife that the first child from Ruth and Boaz would go to what is it named a la mejora or something Milan or it would go to that line or lineage right because you know that's the son of Naomi and that they had to have the lineage in the right order so the first child that would be born from from Ruth and Boaz would go to Naomi and Naomi takes it to her bosom you know and in all in it and really it's a child from because of the law in the kinsman part it's a child now listen it's a child from a lot mayhaw everybody pronounce his name all right and Ruth you so no boy - see just listen just don't get too smart out with it just listen to the point of what I'm getting at because see that way you you did get in it and you'll find out one of these days why the Bible says this endless genealogies they'll trap you up and I get so tickled at people trying to follow lineages and following it down from in this coming down and how they come down to Judah and Tamar and they do this and they bring it down you know and and they have the things and brother Branham called Judah and Tamar adultery and then he says that progestin a seed can't come from adultery we don't listen to him and his wording we just make it to what we want to make it and a beautiful picture you know we'll look at this of how this woman done this and that's done and see you jump right over from from Judah and Tamar and you go to automatically to Ruth and Boaz No then Ruth's being a Gentile coming into the lineage and not only coming in it doesn't go to the second son from Ruth and Boaz to cure the lineage it falls the Obed OB IDI it falls over and Obed is the son born from Ruth and Boaz but the lineage falls back don't go to booth and boys I know it comes down to the irony I can read I can go to Matthew and give you genealogy some 14 here to 14 here to 14 year and it all is in there but it's just the point the point of what I'm trying to get you to see is that that overhead comes from Ruth and Boaz but the name right has had to fall back the ruse first husband and do it so you can't follow the lineages you get all fouled up in lineages and in genealogies and all kind of things you know we just get all to get in there no this goes to this and this goes to that and then you got Rahab the harlot she fits in and here it comes down through to the axon huh this is if we just think and listen and try to be sensible about the Bible and read it the way it's written in things we wouldn't be all massively confused of trying to say oh look at this look at this look at this and look at it oh this is great here look how this fits here and it don't fit you know yeah we got it all built up we didn't okay just put that dough brother Dale to say well we should at least read the word and know what it says okay now what was that we were talking about in the life service okay Jesus say it now watch we're gonna wedge this party into her we're gonna speak of this kinsman alright and talking about him and Jesus says you must be born again or you cannot see [Music] understand or you cannot enter you know uses both names see understand enter the kingdom of God alright see then why must we be born again you remember how we were bringing this out and our thoughts was on it but run said on the spoken word his original seed said we're born in sin from Eve's sin born in sin from Eve sin and as we're doing that then there's nothing in any of us no lineages that could ever be anything since it's like to see everybody lays that part of will look at Judah and Tamar and from dark came David from David came Jesus and you don't even realize that's a natural lineage to be carried over to her it's not the spiritual lineage that was the point of once a Timon ago see it's not the spiritual lineage the spiritual lineage comes through from Abraham Isaac and C then it would jump away over but it's carrying on what is said in the Bible of the Book of Ruth is a book wedged in to show you the genealogies and things to cover you know the point of understanding what Redemption it our lineage isn't thought so used to following that line alright but see when because Jesus was not born from the earth right he was born from above and the original translation there in John 3 you know where he says you must be born again it says you must be born from above all right brother branham verifies it we gave you quotes and different things on it to understand but what does it mean to be born from above there's no physical point or thought there's no genealogy there's no seeds or thoughts like that because he said you must be born from above he said in other words you must be born from where I was born from and I'm not of this world I was not of this world and he covers in the scriptures and we went through it we'll do it a little more this evening where he's saying look if my kingdom was of this world my just my followers would fight and he said it's not that away see you do away when you come from the Old Testament that was the point of what I'm driving it see we want to try to make these lineages run out and who was it and was it speaking was it Aaron Wednesday anyhow talking about do you think them Jews brethren said it's you know so do you think them Jews would tell them tell the the way you know that they have lied and give his life away and done this and that now you think the most honest Jews would write that in there no they wouldn't have done it it was a Holy Spirit made in put that in there they had to write it according to what he said because it's not the natural genetic genealogies or whatever you want to call them it's come from Abraham to Isaac and fault as a spiritual because Abraham is the father of the faith spiritual seeds see we're supposed to get away from that natural genealogy if we're going to come to a New Testament then we're supposed to be coming to a new position to not be covered in genealogies or thoughts but to be in the spiritual genealogies and under thy seed which was Christ all right see then Christ never come caught if you run the natural lineage of Christ even with putting in Ruth and Boaz and in all of these things that you got in and Rahab the harlot and all of that mixture that you've got and Judah and Tamar and all of those things that you got all wound up and you try to run your lineage and your natural lineage goes to Joseph the one that married Mary it doesn't go to Mary there's no lineage for the women so if you're gonna take your natural lineage to look where you go you didn't read that and there's no Baptist Methodist Presbyterian before you come into message but I didn't have to explain them things the way he explained it was great because it sure was a whole lot better than what we had it would get the point the Bible has written it was told that away and see you can't follow those natural genetic lineages they won't work you got to come to a spiritual lineage to start a New Testament and seeing that even the physical lineage won't line up in the Old Testament how you gonna run all of them things was run here through this and obedience well I got this thing out there oh they just got these great doctrines in it they will get to that in a minute or this evening a little bit about it but what about it see why you find then you must be born again because Jesus's first message was you must be born from above in other words you've got to be born from where I came from a natural birth of of dude that won't do anything to go back a time and and go back into your mom and come back out of that wouldn't do you no good all right so then get away from all of those things or we'll be like Nicodemus we'll be saying you know what's this and what's that we don't understand that you can't run those things you've got to come to the basis of the truth see you must be born again you must be born from above all right you've got to be born because she was born wrong to start with then we had that one but now here's the one I was quoting it and I really missed quoted it I'll show you in a second you know I had it right but I mean it's just amount of numbers go to number two and let's get just out and get it out of the way and then we'll move on all right now watch what brother Branham says on you must be born again and I've asked you to read the message or listen you must be born again statue of perfect man key to the door why we're against organized religion statue of perfect man blasphemous names and watch you said well brother branham come to blaspheme his name's he come to statue of perfect man and he said it like this when he come to a statute permit you remember what he said in there he said I just got this the other day on something lies don't preach all well you know what he just got that the other day on something he's gonna preach off in other words you know what he didn't have that two days before he got the scriptures that lined up something for him now the other message I want you to go back to is a little message called Intervale or the title has been changed to why as my people talked about but it's called Intervale 19 and 56 and you'll see that in 1956 he was preaching a greater depth of understanding about the new birth then mankind could open understand because he says there's only two or three or one he set up really only heard one man who believed it the way I believe it yeah we know all about it you know all right so get this message you must be born again alright watch what it says we find out that there is so many different meanings that people put to it it's all about what is the new Burke you know the morning and experience now when you're studying the message if you'll put born-again experience and the new birth into one category it'll help you a whole lot because you're gonna find brother around them many many times mentioning you must be born again and you know I mean you know the new birth and they're being born again it ain't two separate times we're going the Lord willing we're gonna get into some it may be a little eye-opening to us about the new birth maybe you'll see then why the Prophet said there's not too many new birth now watch him this is what he's talking about you must be born again right we find out that there is so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say that you must be born again what but each one has their their different interpretations to that what it means to be born again I might go to the Methodist Church this morning they say we believe that you must be born again how do you interpret it I go to the Baptist Church and we believe you must be born again how do you interpret it I would go to each search and we'd find if we went to all the nine I said eleven hundred the other day on it I knew it was nine hundred but that was his mouth outrunning brain if we want to all the went to all the nine hundred different denominations of churches there'd be nine hundred different interpretation at one point what you must be born again the one message that Jesus the first one he pries you'd have nine hundred so seeing that there is so many different interpretations and yet a Bible doctrine there must be and is a truth somewhere that you take the 969 or whatever different we talked about it nine hundred different in denominations and what about you put about two thousand in the message because as he said each church system the Methodist have their way of saying it the Baptist's how their way of saying it you know you go to one and you'd say well well all you got to do is believe that's badness you know what Methodists used to be say you know this is where a long time ago it's not now now you just go do what you want to go you don't you don't do nothing you know but it used to be the Methodists they shouted you know and you've heard run around and say that they even poured water on them he said or they had come through speaking in tongue but he poured water on their Methodists to stop them from shouting another word all right let's see what about one doctrine 902 use it incorrectly of that form of what he's saying it different ways of one doctrine then you turn around and come in this message and you got the two souls the two lords the peruses and the son of man's and the river Jordans you got all that and if you don't believe it like they believe it then you're not born again and see each one of them has got thoughts and ideas each of the nine hundred churches as he was doing them has their way of expressing it but they have truth the people this message how truth you know doctrines are not built on there shouldn't be but we know now they've getting built on this about anything but they shouldn't be built on flim-flam ideas they should have a little truth to it what and what about 900 in different ways of saying you must be born again don't you think it's going to take us quite a while to get into that because we're going to have to state some things that is going to sound contrary to your previous beliefs to be able to express the things that are said about it so I would be considerate of the next few services and try to attend or at least listen to the message yeah all right so now what is it see why must you be born again because you're born wrong we covered that in the last message all right now then what does it mean you must be born again then it comes down to what we're talking about the message oncoming storm but we live here he said you know like you heard him say his wife would say it's you know well well we're not of this world she'd say well what are we you know are we not American doing i he said no all the limbs got a nice analogy away in a nature about him he says no words we live here but we're born from above the Holy Spirit of God comes upon us born from above the spirit of Christians you know as Christians that's borne by the Spirit of God is born from above their spirit is of another Kingdom and I'm so glad that you must be born from above when you say born again you got to be born from above wherever he came from is where we've got to go now I relate that like brother branham senators you know he said a preacher will rock standing up and preaching ladies on the backside of the desert and meets God personally hunting about well then ain't no preachers we'd have to ever one go to Israel and we got to find somewhere on the backside of the desert where Moses was that you know that's impossible okay that's what I'm what I'm saying it's just impossible so it's impossible to follow the thought or a line of mankind on that you must be born again he said we're living in America off of the message called the kinsman redeemer he said that's true that's the body part said but the soul that conducts us our character is born above born from above we live from above because we're born from above all Christians come from above they were not of this world he said he's not of this world right jesus said I'm not from below I'm from above if I was from below my subjects would fight for me but my kingdom is of above and so is every man that's born to the kingdom of God he's from above born from above to be born again is to be born from above well I don't understand what you're getting in whatever brought him here has to bring you here wherever he came from you must come from the well know how cuz we were not talking about her body now he just said they were Americans he said that the body part ain't gonna do it it's whether or not you and I are born again if we were born again we're born from above because the Nicodemus couldn't understand it he thought it was something natural here on earth and Jesus was trying to explain to him that that was not what it was when eternal life comes in and the message while I'm against organized religion when eternal life comes in there born from above and the works from God manifests himself because of the same life that was in him it cannot do anything else eternal life can only come from above now don't get lost in thoughts of trying to figure out what do you mean above I mean one simple plain language he came from another world not a Superman ideology as of this days but they do get two points and try to present them he came from above he never came from this earth he came down from above to walk on this earth and none of this was his he created it and everything but he wound up having to borrow one to be born from had to borrow a grave to be buried in him he was so much from above until he said my kingdom is from above as I've always said about you know the pilot the role there was when it was questioning him you know he evidently laid down so you know we just read thoughts of what his dark but evidently Jesus laid down so much of a thought before Pilate until Pilate said to them I'm not afraid of this guy I'd like to have this guy on my team I'm not afraid of him because he's not talking about any kind of a kingdom that would be of this world he speaks of some kind of a kingdom some other way or some something and said wouldn't it be great for a kingdom to come some word take over all of this and and run this you know you understand what I'm getting in Pilate said I'm not afraid of him he turned him he'll send him back he said I find no fault I found no reason he said are you a king he said to this end was I born or he turned back to him and said is that what you're saying did you get that from yourself where'd you get that from somebody else that you're thinking about me being a king and he just said I don't have nothing to do with my cuz it was so much from above you know where our problem is we live a split condition we live in an earthly body that is from this dimension time and kingdoms and we have a spiritual new birth that takes place on the inward man and that's supposed to come from above you know the Holy Ghost did come down right don't mean just the point but it did come down you know and Jesus was constantly talking about my father in heaven right he was constantly praying and doing those things but do you get what I'm talking about he says I can see God oh let's get the point he says now is my kingdom not from hence in other words my kingdom is not from here all right are we solved on that so then whatever the new birth is it's going to have to be from above right it's going to have to be something supernatural it's going to have to be something spiritual and not physical so then our physical genealogies wouldn't work me like they say in the message you know if you happen to be born from Adam and and Eve said you could be saved but said if you're born from the Beast and Eve you can't be saved because that surface seed well I've always preached it and always said forget it everyone of us was born serpent seed I don't care whether you like it or not you tell me where you come from did you come from above are you a Superman that dropped to earth no now we've got to get this natural part running right all right now listen he said he came from above I like that because of the relationship that I can read through the prophets message and to realize that God came from heaven whatever you call it another dimension the thought to this earth to redeem us you had to come that away now what and then listen he never sent a son he came himself right so then it was not a father sending the son he never sent an angel I got plenty of laying here in front of he would never sent a prophet or an angel or anything like that he came himself because he came from above see God came himself and was made a human God himself now didn't send a son didn't send a second person or a third person well there's no such thing he came himself to pay the price because he's the only one worthy remember the kinsman had to be worthy visit I mean financially to pay the price he had to be kinfolks to be able to have any transaction to go with it all right so you remember what happened in the Book of Ruth there was one closer kin the Book of Ruth tells you that now the brother rod said it was the devil now if you want to claim anything of being born from any just remember you was born between the Beast and Eve no I wouldn't I've got this genealogy I can write all the way back and I got all this in genies oh I can I can prove where I came from you can you need to get locked up with all of these guys that climbing all of these things and you know of evolution and try to evolve yourself down some way we don't fool of that go that's garbage all right but now think about it this kinsman had to come from another dimension another world another situation he came to earth to become kinfolks to you and I which meant that by doing that that he would have to come into human flesh so then the Prophet would explain in body he's a man a human being he said in Soul he's Almighty God he said in spirit that's Almighty God dwelling in that that's why the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world you don't listen when brother Adam is saying things if you'd listened he's reading scriptures but we thank him as being something that well you know and blood around him we'll say he said look said at one time said the son was speaking remember that one he said and another time the father was speaking well that sounds like two people but we've got to rule that out because it can't be that and what would rule it out would be the fact of God coming here and not sending another person me he didn't send the Sun he was the Sun see one of these days we're going to realize realization of the Godhead and begin to understand some things that the Prophet taught us in the 40s in things in the fifties and the sixties but yet we don't know what truth is do you realize brother Brennan said in body he was a man he said that was the Son of God now we're not Trinitarian that wasn't God the Son no it's the son of God there's no such thing the Bible is God the Son see it's the Son of God but why would Jesus stand and say you ask anything in my name your profit would be praying along and he said Lord now we're taught to do this he's talking to the Lord he said we're taught to do this he said we're taught to ask in Jesus name and said we ask it in the name of your son do we think we're releve 'td and what you want to call it because we can jump up and claim the name of God as Jesus but just remember Jesus was a man the body part was a man laying in that cradle was Almighty God Jehovah crying in the cradle the body a man a kinsman he had to do that to be able to pay the price he couldn't pay the price at spirit room come we didn't send spirit room we fell in flash we did spirit room yeah that's okay go ahead remember the main thing was the flesh was what took it into the reality are you following me if we all understood to Godhead I like that quote from run around in the church age book he said something went out and he said it would be great if everybody understood the oneness with the Godhead do we understand the oneness of the Godhead that that human flesh is my brother that was the only way he could become kinfolks to me he had to do that because that would be the only way and look we already had one closer kin right the Book of Ruth which was the devil in other words we've born kinfolks to the devil no I think no no no we wasn't see him see those where you'd go ahead see you're born kinfolks to the devil there was one had a right to purchase us according to the Book of Ruth and according to the Prophet explaining it and that was the devil the natural story I've always tried to tell you you looked at the natural story you know the story what it was as I said a moment ago about the the child going back to the name he that was where boys were smart read your Bible I just reading it a minute ago when Moyes went out to the Kinsmen that was closer kin he said by the ride of Naomi and he says I will read your Bible I will buy boys said well Ruth now I told you that you got one closer kin and if he buys you it and pays for you then you gonna go with him in other words he's telling her this day you're gonna go with one of the other you going with him are you going with me because he'll pay the price then you're going with him and she knew that that was the rules of regulation if she paid if that kinslin paid Naomi for Naomi he got everything and looking if you read you buy he gotten he never got just Naomi he got the two sons names property Ricci Bible sitting there I just got to reading it Luka Ruth he didn't just get the one a ruse got both of them both of them descenders didn't have to bring up children - the second one the other one but he had to bring up children to Ruth's husband to keep the story running correct all right now listen so what did he do he says okay kinsman you got to write your the nura ken do you realize what that means being uric in you realize you and I were Newark into the devil and we was God the Old Globe we don't want to add to it we don't want them things no I was brother Dave you don't under what's this about these evidences that we have in the doctrines of the mess I was born of this seed in me I don't need nothing I'd boil eternal life that's what you preach the message well if you was you don't need no kinsman-redeemer at all you didn't need boys no but see Boaz was smart he says okay kinsman the day you by Naomi now listen if Ruth had have been married to a closer kin into the family that kinsman would have took it if she'd have been born down the Jewish line we'll call it on the Israeli line of people you know what she wasn't she was born to Gentiles you know you understand what I'm getting at the two husbands were Gentiles now so he says the day you do said you're gonna have to bring him children took all his my headline I ready my lawn because he's the mister husband of Ruth in that near kinsman boy he said to her he said I won't do that I ain't bringing no Gentile into my lineage I'm giving you natural story so he turns to boys and he said boys is he you reading the right I'm not gonna do it the boys were smart he tricked him into letting him have what he wanted all right what are you with me now he never sent another person he came his cell to be kinfolks to you and me he become our kinsman the Bible coach that he's not ashamed to call his brother you know fleshly speaking he's our father our mother our healer or all away he's my brother because he was born in human flesh that was created for the purpose of making the kinsman Satan could never come that way he tried and couldn't get to ride but Jesus Christ came straight from glory to earth to be my brother and your brother to pay the price that we could be redeemed not sending to another he came himself he came himself of course it's on tape that door we do but remembers on paragraph 176 of the kinsman redeemer he said first you belong to him talking about the devil he send the message there he's talking about the devil we had another kinsman so when you and I were born naturally we were born naturally right physically human beings now Satan perverted that line to come down because there was no way he could get in and and bring his own gene or germ or seed or whatever right he didn't have anything for that so he mixed up the spiritual part and made it falling into the line of the flesh and when it fell into the line of flesh everything that comes from that wound wound up to be polluted they don't make no difference whether it was cane or able it was polluted we gave you scriptures are the other day about it right I'm going through he's just born of a woman all right see then we came into human flesh Satan could not come and create that flesh right couldn't do that but he perverted the flesh that we would be brought into he came our kin folks I'd like to think about this body belonging to God but he's gonna have to redeem it for too long to him right now okay she didn't what are we we were born the property of the devil oh that's just like an old Mayflower I guess the tickled at that I guess our life gets the tickle trying to explain something and it comes up like that you know and they say my family come over on the Mayflower mine did too there's probably crooks and stowaways I'm wearing a boat how'd yours get here some I don't know although my lineage mm-hmm what good is lineage what we need is a kinsman brother Brennan said on the message my commission he's our kinsman redeemer isn't that right that God was manifest in flesh to take our place to be a kinsman to us as explained in the Book of Ruth and Exodus and he become kinfolks to us to be able to end to pay the price so then the price now listen I'm DOMA everything that Adam lost you know that quote but it's the manifestation of the spirit everything that Adam lost you find in the Book of Ruth that Jesus Christ come to return her restore and Adam lost the right to come forth and bring that flesh into a place of eternity so then it fell for God to have to come God himself now not another one God would have to come to human flesh that's what I love about it when you you talk to people and you just see they can't understand the Godhead you say during that baby they'll run said your God with no teeth he said you're over crying in a cradle I just don't see how that could be God and see he was the very soul of Almighty God in that human being the very spirit of Almighty God you and I how did we come we come a body a spirit insight was still mine right are you with me we come body and spirit in Satan's domain Jesus had to walk among us but that spirit that was within him was not just a man's spirit it was the spirit of Almighty God heed now listen he didn't have a man's spirit in the Spirit of God that spirit was the spirit of Almighty God that's what's your prophet says and I ain't gonna argue it when just quote what he said he said in soul he was God he said in spirit he was God he said spirit he was he said that way he knew everything now we see we only got the body I mean we got the body and the spirit into the realms of Satan you know by the new birth now listen I'm coming up a new birthing back this true by the new birth he gives your soul eternal life your soul is just as eternal as his soul but your body your spirits not so we had to have then a kinsman to pay the price to get the body here to bring it in the right way Cody could have never been done so he had to be made my kinsman's kinsman they find to be kinsman every night I had kinsman redeemer nice racing at us and all these Asians my kinsman because he's not just my Redeemer he's my all in the hall and he's my god standing in human flesh he's everything he's Father Son and Holy Ghost he's Lord Jesus Christ he's Rose of Sharon Linda devout he's everything and his name is Jesus the little baby was Almighty God but see we're so smart it was that who was running the world while he was in the crate oh I straighten him out on that and I got I got you straightened out all right but listen God Himself is off the message the manifestation of the Spirit God who is in spirit unveiled himself in a body of flesh which was his son Christ Jesus and God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and became kinfolks to human beings to suffer the penalty that he had put on the human himself and he became kinfolks and a redeemer not just speak 10 folks or whatever so you want to make it to one point when I take the whole package if he paid the price for everything why can't we just believe for everything you know why are we gonna fall short see that's like the people of the message and you know the denominations teaching the people this message I'm gonna get a new body they just don't believe in the blood of Jesus Christ being enough to redeem this one when the Prophet said you drop that you pick something else up that's not redemption he said you bring back the same thing and to solve the problem with the people of the message you know wrote around taught it that way but to solve it will one time when Jesus raised he raised with nail prints in his hands in his feet and holding his side letters don't understand that man well what's wrong with it he became my kinsman to take my place - worth it it would not just be to try now listen this is unreal careful for a second you know yourself better run said Adam in the garden God breathed in his nostrils bless him it's night eternal life made him an eternal person with God so what if he'd just done that to you and I on left her side away what if it's just that he gives you the new birth and leaves you in that situation you know you'd have to have a new body you're not how something but you can't do that his body was redeemed not it it was sinful it had a beginning anything has a beginning has to be redeemed his body was made eternal but he made a way for you and I to reach eternal life in body spirit and soul if he could call his brother so that he could redeem the fallen race that he could redeem the Fallen race and watch your profit in his stories had always least told it he said he had to be worthy he said in other words he had to be physically you know enough money to pay the prize and said not only would it be that away to where he could pay the price he said that has to be but city has to be nearer kin so how could he become European the god of glory can pay the streets of gold we talk all right but it had to become kinfolks to pay the price that's what he's I love this one that's why he's our advocate you know what he knows what it is there's no sin as it robs mr. scripture that's come upon man that he didn't go through now see I know you're smart out I go we're gonna go ahead and blow your brains the women to say he never had a baby no but he went through a whole lot worse than having any baby and they beat him with that cat of nine tails if then there's a whole lot more than you women having a baby I'm I'm not against that part I'm just to the point of work that I'm sorry I think we're so silly but he never had a baby he don't know what it was like to have a baby no he knows a whole lot work I wouldn't want to be a woman in swap places with it it's just honest I just try to make it the plain and then when I make it plain that comes out too plain see because you relate to it and but it makes you look good you know or something some ego situation but listen can you realize this is my whole point of the message can you realize God became human to pay my price he was he had he could he could paid your price with gold thinning ten foot high or way around the whole universe because he was worthy than away but he had to be kinfolks that didn't cost him a whole lot of money that didn't cost him streets of gold that didn't cost him all kind of high-priced things it cost him his life because there was no way to pay the price just because now in the Book of Ruth the boys remember don't die because that's just part of the story that's just a natural but in this hour Boaz has to die he had to pay the price he had to die human death to be able to redeem you and me but Rena said there's one thing about it he said the new birth he said it makes you a child of God he said but then you turn around and you just differ I'm paraphrasing a quote he says you differ with the word he says you prove you're not his child then that something we're gonna find out and maybe a little bit in predestination of why God chose you no I chose him no you didn't choose him he chose you then you accepted him but he followed me now he is our kinsman because he came to be able to pay the price now paying that price was not a pile of gold this price required death he had to die to release his life that could come back in us that would start the plan of redemption I said start because you get the Holy Ghost like there penticoff it's just to start to start to plan a Redemption Almighty God had to come from glory and come to earth to pay the price and all the time he knew what he was here for he knew what he came for you think about I think it this way maybe it's not but this is where I think did you think about in the garden he's he prayed so that his sweat became as drops of blood scientifically they say that there is a position in pain that you could literally come to work now I've read this no that's all right I don't care that it would come to where the elements of your body would break down that you would be so much into pain and agony that it could actually happen and you realize what he was doing you realize I turned the garden that he knew what about all the Scriptures had come to his mind while he was in the garden come on he knew those scriptures and he knew how that they'd beat him how they do him because he knew the Scriptures and what it said and he knew that it was not for himself that he was doing it he knew it was for you and me he knew the scriptures were telling him how he'd be beaten how he'd be done how he'd been put on how they do everything how they would put the crime with orange how they do everything you say well some of that wasn't even written well don't worry about it he knew it before it was written just get the point no wonder his sweat became his drops of blood when he could realize and the worst thing that I can think about I've preached this to you before but you think that were sin you could think about the worst thing that I can think about that would be the burden upon him was to know that ever one of them disciples and every one of you and me was gonna leave him in the garden if I'd have been Narada you'd have been there you'd have been running like crazy because I would have to don't think that away no I would have I would have stood out sorry oh so did Peter oh yeah so did Peter Peter grab the sword he's doing pretty good he was getting in the fight he said come on boy what he cooks in here it wasn't Jesus's words to him it was Jesus's words made him realize hey this guy ain't gon fight I better run with the rest of right I better run with the rest of them killed I sure can't hook the whole crowd right what about it yes but if I'd have been back dar where are you now because where you are now where you and me are now is exactly where we would have been back there right no I would have stood up for him well what do you stand up for now the church we talk about us being in the end of time in the world coming to an end and in the rapture being close at hand and yet we just slowly falling backwards we're not as dedicated as we used to be we're not as sincere as we used to be I said we dump it all of us right what about it come on musicians what about it is he your kinsman by being your kinsman would require him to be Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ Alpha Omega being and all of the great everything you could think of ever points you could think of to be a kinsman as I said then a lot of it is not dealing maybe with redeeming so that's reason I chose to put it kinsmen instead of kinsman redeemer because we're supposed to be Christ living in this earth not as a point to have to be doing this or have to be doing that I've said this and I mean it seriously brother branham never come now listen and you listen right because you make me say something I don't say that's your business everybody never come to teach us about women's dress and hiring clothes you Pentecostals are already on that line now us Baptists until the fifties what about you Presbyterians you others until I'm along in the 50s you didn't are go to church looking wrong right did right around have to come through to tell us is wrong to cut you higher from women No now come on we'll pick it right and make it to the point the / churches had got so far away from it - they didn't even know that's what it said so he had to bring it come on get right and what I'm talking about he brought it but he didn't have to bring them time you don't have to be a Christian to know that a lot of things are wrong let's tan you don't have to be claiming a Christian to know it's wrong to commit adultery you don't have to do that you don't even have to be a good badness to realize that you might really realize consequences that goes with things they see we want to put it all into one point you know and try to well bread around come straighten out all this stuff there's a lot he didn't have to straight now we didn't miss Church in the Baptist Church we didn't go on vacation that it was not related to church about you and not the way you lived well you know the Prophet didn't tell us we had to do that did he no we done it because it was the thing it was life at the time it was what we knew and thought of as being Christianity right lean brother Brown had to come tell you is wrong to drag around the curse and wrong to steal and like I said or you won't roll your point he done those things because a lot of people never been talked to true they didn't know it was wrong so he told it like it was listening to a message other night and then he estimates what was the name of it I forgot but if you ever one of these days I'll get around to run it back listen but in that message I listened to him standing there and I could see that he truly was a prophet not because that he was bringing the word in a certain ways or whatever ain't talking about that and that message I'm talking about he was coming right down the line from the White House to every house in the country and telling how far we'd got away from God and I said to her listen I thought Elijah did come because he went from the White House right back to our houses and tell him where we went wrong he didn't necessarily preach Christian you know quit doing this and quit doing that and it's wrong to do this under there he was just telling the natural it was just like he had went to the White House and was representing Jesus Christ as a prophet and not trying to preach no religious thing other than the condemnation that God had sent and I just sat down to listen the Lord he was a prophet but he had it as it he had no grace in that message it was just straight why do we have Anita well we got brother Joe anybody have a need the olders open [Music] my life he is the line anybody have a need what about it can you see he became my brother not just our Savior but our brother you become our advocate which means one who stands in my place [Music] thank God [Music] I for hash [Music] if it
