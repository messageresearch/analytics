[8:27] nothing else man's ideas and our ideas
[8:30] nothing's true
[8:31] except god's word that's kind of what
[8:34] we're going to speak on today
[8:35] we're on the two spirits so we're going
[8:36] to speak on today part 14
[8:39] what is truth because you've got your
[8:42] two spirits in the framework of the
[8:44] church
[8:44] one's true and one's false
[8:47] there's no tweener as we say there's no
[8:49] in between
[8:51] there's there's truth as as the bible
[8:54] tells us and as the prophet tells us and
[8:55] even
[8:56] jesus says i am the way
[9:00] the truth and we'll read that in just a
[9:03] second so let's go to first john 4.
[9:05] uh remember that remember brother bob
[9:07] he's kind of
[9:08] in a stressful way there at work and may
[9:11] the lord bless him and give them i think
[9:13] they're about over it but give them
[9:15] wisdom
[9:16] to deal with what he's dealing with at
[9:18] work so also right after the service
[9:21] remember i'll try to announce it again
[9:23] to see brother terrence at the back door
[9:26] to get your gift from the church but now
[9:29] all
[9:30] other gifts and all other songs and all
[9:32] other skits
[9:33] are going to be done at the barn so
[9:35] everybody know where it's at if you
[9:37] don't
[9:37] if you go out here right there where the
[9:39] prayer request list is there is a map
[9:41] it's really easy go to guildsville look
[9:43] over to post office
[9:45] going up a little further you'll see a
[9:46] road veer off to the left
[9:50] take the first paved driveway
[9:53] on the left there's one little bitty one
[9:55] that shoots off with a red gate
[9:57] but you go to the next one and turn left
[10:01] it's well i mean it's got pavement stuff
[10:03] on it it's kind of
[10:05] that asphalt looking pavement
[10:08] with gravel but anyway you turn to the
[10:09] left right there
[10:11] now look there's two that goes one goes
[10:12] like this
[10:14] take the immediate left all right then
[10:17] and you'll go back
[10:18] by the time you get about 200 feet in
[10:20] you'll almost see it but it's way back
[10:22] in the woods there so don't think you're
[10:23] getting lost
[10:25] and don't think we've sent you on a wild
[10:26] goose chase
[10:28] but that's where we need to do all that
[10:30] down there at the barn and please wear
[10:32] your mask if possible while you're
[10:34] talking i know you can't while you're
[10:35] eating
[10:37] but while you're talking please wear
[10:38] your mouth and please try to stay six
[10:41] feet apart except for family
[10:43] okay so just remember that we'll have
[10:45] hand sanitizer and all the goodies down
[10:46] there for you to uh
[10:48] to practice that and we still want to
[10:50] practice
[10:52] that until until

[11:56] two services gonna try that on the third
[11:59] which would be
[12:00] brother dale and myself give these other
[12:01] guys some time off so
[12:03] because they've been they've been on the
[12:05] plow
[12:06] for a while and we really enjoyed them
[12:08] really enjoyed all of them amen
[12:10] love the ministry here they do a really
[12:12] good job
[12:14] bringing the word of god so uh thank you
[12:17] for your prayers we came back
[12:18] we went hunting we didn't go killing so
[12:21] we went hunting
[12:22] so but we had a good time everybody in
[12:25] kentucky
[12:25] really enjoyed seeing us and we enjoyed
[12:27] seeing them they're dealing with the
[12:29] coveted thing too but they're still
[12:31] having church um
[12:33] so we just want to keep them in our
[12:34] prayers and make sure that we
[12:37] make sure we remember all the pastors
[12:40] around the country that are dealing with
[12:42] this
[12:42] and all the churches and that the lord
[12:45] will give us all wisdom
[12:46] in what to do amen because if we don't
[12:49] forget trust in the lord we can't trust
[12:50] in nothing else so we put all of our
[12:52] trust in the lord so let's
[12:54] bow our heads we're going to go to first
[12:55] john but then we'll go to john 18.
[12:58] this is talking to pilate so let's bow
[13:00] our heads do you heavenly father thank
[13:02] you should give us forgive us of our sin
[13:04] many mistakes that we make lord contrary
[13:06] to your word
[13:08] because we're being human lord we just
[13:09] were born contrary
[13:11] but lord you gave us the baptism of the
[13:13] holy ghost to turn everything back
[13:15] around and send it back in the right
[13:16] direction
[13:17] and that's what you're looking at today
[13:19] lord and we're looking at the atonement
[13:20] not what we did wrong
[13:22] we're looking at the atonement lord that
[13:24] we know that you died at calvary 2000
[13:27] years ago and
[13:28] even this time of the year we're
[13:29] celebrating as the world does the
[13:32] your birth lord but if it hadn't been
[13:35] for calvary
[13:37] you died for us lord you knew that you
[13:40] knew you had to do it and you did it
[13:42] you did it willingly to save
[13:46] our soul and to make this thing come
[13:48] back right thank you for that lord
[13:49] remember us in this season that we will
[13:51] be joyful and everything will be
[13:53] wonderful father and you'll take care of
[13:54] all of us keep us all healthy
[13:56] be with the bride around the world lord
[13:58] take care of them lord you minister
[13:59] today father and just move this vessel
[14:01] out of the way and you take over in
[14:02] jesus name we pray
[14:04] amen all right so let's get the calendar
[14:07] and leave it right there
[14:09] i guess all right here we go beloved
[14:11] believe not
[14:12] every spirit but try the spirits whether
[14:14] they are of god because many false
[14:16] prophets are going out into the world
[14:19] hereby know we the spirit of god every
[14:21] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[14:23] has come in the flesh
[14:24] is of god now listen it's like i told
[14:26] you before you can confess that jesus
[14:28] christ is god and
[14:30] and be an alcoholic or be a drunk and be
[14:32] a whoremonger and everything else
[14:33] but you got to really when you confess
[14:36] you know that that man
[14:38] lived 2 thousand years ago but he's now
[14:39] in your flesh
[14:41] and man jesus christ now is in you in
[14:43] your flesh
[14:45] and that's what we confess
[14:48] because most of the world thinks he's
[14:49] the second person of the trinity
[14:51] which is totally false no such thing as
[14:54] that amen
[14:55] we knew he was almighty god no more
[14:58] no less amen hereby know you the spirit
[15:02] of god every spirit that confesses to
[15:04] jesus christ come in the flesh is of god
[15:06] and every spirit that confesses not that
[15:07] jesus has come in the flesh is not of
[15:09] god
[15:10] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[15:12] whereof you have heard that it should
[15:14] come and
[15:14] even now already is in the world 2 000
[15:17] years ago
[15:18] year of god little children have
[15:19] overcome them because greater is he
[15:21] that's in you
[15:22] than he that's in the world they are of
[15:24] the world therefore speak they of the
[15:26] world
[15:26] and the world here at them in other
[15:28] words the daily conversation
[15:30] of the world they they get together and
[15:32] they talk about this and that and the
[15:33] other and then you get together and talk
[15:34] about the word of god and how god's been
[15:36] good and they'll they'll agree with you
[15:37] that far but when you start going into
[15:39] the major doctrines and you start
[15:40] reading the bible to them and you start
[15:41] talking to them about one god water
[15:43] baptism
[15:44] no eternal hell and all they
[15:47] that's when the conversation ends they
[15:49] might be there in body
[15:51] but they're not there in spirit because
[15:53] they're not paying attention to anything
[15:55] you're saying after that all right
[15:57] we are of god he that knoweth god here
[15:59] with us he that is not of god here if
[16:01] not us hereby know we now look
[16:02] here's where i got the thought from
[16:04] hereby know we
[16:06] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[16:09] error that separation there you may be
[16:11] seeing let's read john 18 as you're
[16:12] seated
[16:13] john 18 37 pilate therefore said unto
[16:16] him
[16:17] king then jesus says that i am a king
[16:21] to this end i was born and for this
[16:24] cause i came into the world
[16:25] that i should bear witness unto the what
[16:28] truth
[16:29] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[16:33] voice what was pilate's problem
[16:35] he was not of the truth what was the
[16:38] jews problem that put jesus on the cross
[16:40] they were not of the truth but pilate
[16:43] says unto him
[16:45] what is truth he was confused he didn't
[16:48] have the truth there was the
[16:50] no truth was found in him so now let's
[16:52] read john 14
[16:53] 6 jesus said unto him i am the way
[16:56] the truth and the life no man cometh
[16:58] unto the father
[17:00] but by me so there's no other way
[17:05] you say oh now i don't know about truth
[17:07] i don't know who's got truth that
[17:08] listen if you've got the baptism of the
[17:10] holy ghost in your soul today you have
[17:13] truth
[17:13] amen you have the truth not a truth
[17:17] there's a lot of
[17:18] truths but there's not the truth the
[17:21] truth
[17:22] is that bible and what jesus christ said
[17:24] right and then
[17:25] and then we know one thing people you
[17:27] know get all convoluted and worried
[17:29] about the
[17:29] this and that the other going on about
[17:31] us believing that god sent a prophet but
[17:34] look at that confusion out in the world
[17:40] look at all the confusion out in the
[17:41] world if jesus
[17:43] stood up one day and said i am the way i
[17:46] am the truth and i am the life
[17:48] and the bible says in the beginning was
[17:50] the word word was with god and the word
[17:52] was god
[17:55] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[17:57] among us then that must have been the
[17:59] truth
[18:00] but what was he he was the word right
[18:03] glory so what is truth
[18:05] if we would have been standing there
[18:06] went during pilate's time and we know
[18:08] what we know now we'd go
[18:10] that's true point to jesus that's true
[18:12] that's right
[18:13] that's the truth right there but
[18:16] we weren't standing there wasn't our
[18:17] time right so brother brown says in the
[18:20] extra position of the seven church ages
[18:22] we good okay i don't
[18:25] my own son says don't know if we're good
[18:27] or not okay now remember this
[18:29] christ in the true church see i got that
[18:30] under the line there is a true remember
[18:33] i'm going to read this quote
[18:34] stand right there real quick they don't
[18:35] have it in the back keep it right there
[18:37] though
[18:38] brother brown said in the rising of the
[18:40] sun he says
[18:41] there has been churches churches brides
[18:44] brides churches brides brides
[18:47] but there has got to come one
[18:51] there's not two brides you don't take
[18:54] two women now maybe some people do if
[18:56] they believe in polygamy
[18:57] but they're you're only supposed to have
[18:59] one wife right right
[19:01] brother dale and i were listening to
[19:02] marriage and divorce coming back from um
[19:05] hunting the other day i kind of wanted
[19:06] to listen to that again and
[19:08] and you know brother brown hits on that
[19:09] he said christ can't have
[19:12] i mean christ can have multiple wives
[19:15] because the man can have i understand
[19:17] what i mean but remember
[19:19] that bride can't have but one husband
[19:22] but if you take on a different doctrine
[19:25] or that error that we're talking about
[19:27] you're actually
[19:28] worshiping satan thinking you're going
[19:31] home with another husband right
[19:33] right how horrible is that but that's
[19:35] the truth that's why marriage in divorce
[19:36] is hard
[19:37] it doesn't work i think it's dude
[19:41] well they picked the time to die okay
[19:45] well we might have to get another one
[19:46] then
[19:48] i'm not gonna move around at least maybe
[19:51] it starts speaking spanish or something
[19:52] i don't know
[19:54] maybe everything's hung on spanish
[19:58] never forget joe canada did that one day
[20:00] joseph
[20:03] me and timbo was getting in the truck we
[20:05] were getting ready to go do some cut
[20:06] some yards and stuff and
[20:08] back when we were doing that property
[20:09] preservation and
[20:11] uh we get in the car and crank the thing
[20:15] up and turn on the
[20:16] uh turn on the
[20:19] the gps and they go now i know
[20:22] i'm not wearing i got one and i'm not
[20:24] making fun but
[20:26] joseph had got in there and changed it
[20:27] to chinese
[20:29] the language so anyway it took us about
[20:33] thank goodness that we had about an hour
[20:34] to travel and timbo was over there you
[20:36] remember that tim
[20:37] where are you at out there okay he's
[20:40] sitting over there trying to get it back
[20:41] to
[20:42] so anyway yeah joe canada did that
[20:45] yes he did did that to us while he was
[20:47] working bless his heart i'll get him
[20:49] back one of these days
[20:50] so christ in the true church so like i
[20:52] said before there has to be a true
[20:55] right there can't be 900 different
[20:58] points or
[20:59] denominations or you tell me
[21:02] why there's a methodist on this side of
[21:05] the town
[21:06] and another method that's on this side
[21:07] of the town and they're only about two
[21:09] miles apart
[21:10] then you've got message churches that's
[21:11] not even that far apart
[21:13] and they won't even fellowship with each
[21:14] other what are we going to do in heaven
[21:17] i asked the baptist that one time he
[21:19] never answered me
[21:20] i said you say you got truth he said yep
[21:24] i said what about the methodists you're
[21:26] saying they don't have truth you look at
[21:27] me and you say i don't have truth
[21:29] because there's only one truth
[21:33] i am the way the truth and the life
[21:35] right there's only one truth
[21:37] everything else is false i said so what
[21:40] we're going to do in heaven i said what
[21:42] are you going to do with the methodist
[21:42] when you get up there what are you going
[21:44] to do with me when you get up here you
[21:45] all go
[21:45] it's just going to be all baptist and he
[21:47] never would answer me because see if you
[21:49] nail him down
[21:50] why are you a message believer why are
[21:53] you a baptist or a presbyterian or a
[21:55] methodist
[21:55] because you think they're right that's
[21:57] right right
[21:59] god can't be that confused he's not that
[22:02] confused
[22:04] that's why god had to send a prophet
[22:06] straight from the
[22:07] he became the mouthpiece of god
[22:10] he was not god he was a sinner saved by
[22:12] grace just like me and you
[22:14] amen he was not god but he's got the
[22:17] same god in you
[22:19] the same god that's in you was in him
[22:23] so then you need to respond to that
[22:26] that's what i was telling them
[22:27] we're talking about in kentucky if you
[22:29] don't if you don't have the baptism of
[22:30] the holy ghost you don't have to respond
[22:32] you have nothing to respond with
[22:33] right you can say william branham was
[22:35] false and he did this and he'd all the
[22:36] dates and yada yada but if you've got
[22:38] the holy ghost and i've got the holy
[22:40] ghost
[22:40] we can't respond different to that right
[22:44] that's why jesus was standing there at
[22:46] pilate's hall and
[22:47] and you know even pot you know why
[22:48] pilate said what is truth
[22:51] you know why he said that because jesus
[22:54] said
[22:54] everyone that is of the truth hear my
[22:57] voice here's my voice
[22:58] and he's standing there by himself
[23:01] right right that's right jesus was
[23:04] standing there by himself
[23:05] pilate knew he was not a threat to his
[23:09] earthly kingdom
[23:11] pilate knew that so then he's like well
[23:13] if you're this in other words this is
[23:15] what he's saying if you're
[23:16] if you've got this great kingdom and
[23:17] everyone that hears the truth well
[23:19] follow me where's your followers
[23:22] and then he walks out and tells the jews
[23:24] later on in that
[23:25] in that um part there he walks out and
[23:28] he says i find no fault with him what he
[23:30] was
[23:30] he was no threat pilate just didn't know
[23:33] he was the greatest threat he had ever
[23:35] stood in front of
[23:37] but it was hidden inside of human flesh
[23:40] just like me and you hidden inside
[23:43] that's where the true church is it's not
[23:44] a building it's not a name
[23:46] it's god in your flesh amen amen
[23:49] god residing in your tabernacle
[23:53] all right so christ in the true church
[23:55] is a continuation
[23:57] of the book of acts right now remember
[24:00] the quote i told you there has to come a
[24:02] real bride
[24:03] right glory there is one on the earth if
[24:05] there's not one on the earth
[24:07] the only time there won't be a true
[24:08] bride on the earth is when we leave this
[24:09] place
[24:10] amen that's when there will not be a
[24:13] true gentile bride but now what does he
[24:15] do
[24:15] he goes to israel but remember he had to
[24:17] divorce them
[24:20] so they won't be bribed right they'll be
[24:23] remnant they'll be 144
[24:25] 000 because of the promise that god made
[24:28] in his word he can't go away from that
[24:30] so he has to go he said never will i
[24:32] forget israel well all these thousands
[24:34] of years
[24:35] you read remember in the bible we read
[24:37] it with zechariah where they'll look
[24:38] upon him and see the scars in his hand
[24:40] and he'll say where'd you get those
[24:41] scars he said in the house of my friends
[24:44] not my bride my friends
[24:48] so he goes over there to that 144 000
[24:50] because remember as we were talking last
[24:52] sunday he's not in
[24:54] listen the the foolish virgin does not
[24:56] have the truth
[24:58] right inside of them they have a truth
[25:02] if you have a truth you're not going in
[25:04] a rapture
[25:05] you've got to have the truth which is
[25:07] the baptism of the holy ghost in your
[25:09] soul
[25:10] not anointing you but in your soul
[25:14] so let's read this now but the book of
[25:16] revelation shows how that the antichrist
[25:17] spirit would come into the church and
[25:19] defile it
[25:20] making it lukewarm formal and polish so
[25:22] we know it's coming we know it's already
[25:23] here
[25:25] we know what hap started 2 000 years ago
[25:27] right so let's go back let's go down to
[25:29] the red
[25:29] he knows that if the people get the what
[25:34] true revelation
[25:37] of the true church
[25:40] and what she is and what she stands for
[25:42] so listen you can't be a true church and
[25:45] not do what the word says
[25:47] because the word is the marker the truth
[25:50] i'm getting some rebound up here josh
[25:52] is that it's just happening it's just
[25:54] going to happen
[25:56] okay that's all right i can deal with it
[25:58] and what she stands for and that she can
[26:00] do the greater words
[26:02] now we look today and we think you know
[26:04] i was thinking this morning we
[26:05] about brother ray and all the different
[26:07] ones we thought man
[26:08] lord where are you but he's in all this
[26:11] don't ever forget
[26:12] whatever is going on he's got his
[26:16] eternal immortal hand in it
[26:20] and he being infinite whatever is
[26:22] happening
[26:23] if it's happening to the bride it's for
[26:25] our good right
[26:27] amen glory and light brother tara said
[26:29] he you know
[26:30] i know brother ray is in a better place
[26:32] there's no virus going on over there but
[26:34] sister rita we're still calling time
[26:37] and we need to pray for her and and i
[26:39] want to announce this they have a
[26:40] gofundme account so if you want to send
[26:42] some money
[26:43] she may need it okay i'm just saying um
[26:46] he's been in the hospital for 20
[26:48] something days so i'm sure
[26:53] after the grief happens she'll have more
[26:54] grief for those hospital bills because
[26:58] that's what we get we live in the world
[27:00] this world but look if people get a true
[27:02] revelation
[27:03] of the true church and what she is and
[27:05] what she stands for she can do the
[27:06] greater work she will be an invincible
[27:07] army
[27:08] if they get a white true revelation of
[27:10] the two spirits
[27:11] within the framework of the christian
[27:12] church because remember now as i was
[27:14] telling you in
[27:15] isaiah 3 25 a.d that those
[27:18] doctrines listen those doctrines deceive
[27:22] the whole world
[27:23] oh yeah right 99
[27:26] if there was a billion people
[27:29] 99 999 999
[27:33] 999 billion of them
[27:37] or million toward the billion were
[27:39] deceived
[27:40] there was only like one percent on the
[27:42] earth right that's why if you see your
[27:44] church age
[27:45] where in colombia right in here it
[27:48] almost goes dark
[27:49] they call it the dark ages have you ever
[27:52] noticed that while i've been preaching
[27:54] this have you ever not looked at your
[27:55] church calendar and go well there's the
[27:56] true and there's the false
[27:58] because the black is the false and the
[28:00] white is the true well god separated
[28:02] them in every church age
[28:03] every church age had the truth that's
[28:06] right
[28:07] but they didn't have all the truth as we
[28:10] were talking about in kentucky
[28:11] they didn't get all the way out luther
[28:13] had the truth
[28:15] ma uh martin all the different ones they
[28:17] had the truth
[28:19] but they didn't have all right right the
[28:21] truth
[28:24] luther is the just shall live by faith
[28:26] now god wasn't in the water baptism in
[28:28] the name of father son holy ghost he
[28:29] wasn't in all that stuff that
[28:31] luther wanted to bring out of the
[28:32] catholic church god wasn't in that
[28:34] that's why god had to bring somebody
[28:37] here
[28:38] a mouthpiece in this end time to
[28:41] straighten all that up why did brother
[28:44] brown
[28:44] talk about we were look well mare's in
[28:47] divorce
[28:47] he said you've got into this condition
[28:50] by what
[28:52] misinterpreted theology
[28:56] where did it come from where is
[28:58] misinterpreted theology
[28:59] right here behind this pulpit right amen
[29:02] some preacher has told you it's okay
[29:07] to divorce your wife or divorce your
[29:09] husband and marry anybody you wanted to
[29:10] know that's not the bible we know that
[29:12] right amen
[29:14] but now because of misinterpreted
[29:15] theology
[29:17] god had to give a grace of marriage and
[29:20] divorce to moses he had to give a grace
[29:22] there with paul
[29:23] and now he had to give a grace to
[29:24] brother brown because right there at the
[29:25] end i love what he said he said
[29:27] this is to my people only
[29:31] go on as you are what was he doing he
[29:34] was wiping their slate clean if they
[29:36] would believe it
[29:37] if they would believe it right he said
[29:40] but don't you ever do it again
[29:43] so if you did it again you come right
[29:45] out from under that grace
[29:46] a marriage in divorce all right so i'm
[29:49] not going to get into marriage and
[29:49] divorce because today's
[29:51] a happy day we're going to keep that
[29:52] happy but look we got to know what the
[29:55] two spirits are
[29:56] right there's several you're saying in
[29:59] the building's got living husbands and
[30:00] living wives
[30:02] uh-oh but have you accepted the grace of
[30:05] marriage and divorce
[30:07] to take care of that because remember
[30:09] it's not a it's not an
[30:11] issue of salvation don't ever let me
[30:13] just add this to you it's not it's not
[30:15] a salvation issue the bible says believe
[30:18] on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt
[30:19] be saved
[30:20] but it does take you away from some of
[30:22] the promises that god give you because
[30:24] god can't give you
[30:26] the bible that says you can't do this
[30:30] and then give you all the promises not
[30:32] going to happen right
[30:33] all right remember because there's no in
[30:35] between it's either the truth
[30:37] but god had to send us a prophet to what
[30:40] take us from the faults
[30:41] back to the truth amen all right because
[30:43] he said
[30:44] from this point forward don't you ever
[30:46] do it again
[30:48] what a wonderful grace of marriage
[30:49] endorse but you know what that's what
[30:51] god did when he saved you
[30:52] he taught everything you did i don't
[30:54] care paul says in corinthians he said
[30:57] some of you were revilers whoremongers
[30:59] adulterers yadda yadda all the way down
[31:01] the line he said
[31:02] but you've been watched
[31:05] he said oh foolish galatians you know i
[31:07] was reading the corinthians the other
[31:08] day
[31:09] he went to car rent three times they
[31:12] needed some help
[31:14] he went to car in three times a wrote
[31:16] first corinthians second corinthians and
[31:17] then he was there
[31:18] another year if you'll read in there
[31:19] he'll you'll see where he said i've been
[31:21] i've come to you three times
[31:23] why they needed help but you know what
[31:24] they it cleaned that church up
[31:28] that's what we want we were all born
[31:30] dirty
[31:32] what about somebody with something
[31:33] mentioned the other day about pat tyler
[31:35] you know he was a
[31:36] gangster he killed people he was a
[31:37] murderer right
[31:39] yeah but brother brown said he was a
[31:42] holy ghost film man
[31:44] went out preaching and you said
[31:47] hey it doesn't matter if you just smoke
[31:49] cigarettes
[31:51] it doesn't matter if you just did xyz
[31:54] it's all one sin
[31:56] one sin which is unbelief all right so
[32:00] let's just keep that in our
[32:01] in our mind and not uh that's why we the
[32:04] bible tells us not to judge
[32:06] let the bible judge let the bible do
[32:08] that for us but now that's our
[32:10] that's our sounding board that's our
[32:11] truth so you got to go back to
[32:14] it
[32:17] so by god's spirit discern and withstand
[32:18] the antichrist spirit satan will be
[32:20] powerless before her
[32:21] now we're going to read the next
[32:23] position of the church age number two
[32:25] did you get it now these are the two
[32:27] twins again there are those two trees
[32:29] growing side by side in the same earth
[32:31] partaking of the same nourishment
[32:32] drinking in the same rain
[32:34] benefiting by the same sun but they come
[32:37] from different seeds
[32:38] now look one tree is for the word of god
[32:41] right
[32:42] there's your true and now one seed
[32:45] and loves it and obeys it the other tree
[32:47] is from the sea that is anti the word
[32:49] and look changes it where it wants to
[32:55] now that's exactly what happened at nasa
[32:57] they changed
[32:58] the original truth of the bible
[33:03] and man just fell for it why because
[33:06] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[33:08] you'll fall right
[33:10] for anything right yeah amen because you
[33:13] have no
[33:14] type post you have no guide to say what
[33:16] does the word say how many times like i
[33:17] said before have you been sitting in a
[33:19] church service
[33:20] and you listen to a preacher preaching
[33:22] and you go
[33:23] you feel that little bump
[33:27] and you go man that ain't right and it
[33:29] wasn't right
[33:30] if you got the baptism the holy ghost
[33:31] that's what you need to depend on
[33:33] and now you can have a little bump and
[33:35] say i have a question and go ask the
[33:36] question but when it's blatantly against
[33:38] even the word of god i hate it but
[33:40] people in this message have changed the
[33:42] word of god they've done the same
[33:43] thing these people in the denominations
[33:45] have done right
[33:47] made it cold formal and powerless
[33:51] but they got signs and wonders i i got a
[33:53] quote right over here
[33:54] signs and wonders the real bride
[33:59] i'll read it later i can't find it now
[34:01] but she'll not go after all that because
[34:03] signs
[34:03] follow the believer signs follow the
[34:06] word of god
[34:09] and then let's look at the word deceived
[34:11] deceived is to cause to accept that's
[34:13] true or valid what is false or invalid
[34:15] jesus was standing there he said i am
[34:17] the way the truth and the life
[34:18] i am the truth and pilate said
[34:23] i just really don't see that i see you a
[34:24] good man and you got some followers but
[34:27] they're not outside threatening my
[34:30] kingdom
[34:31] actually the people that you're dealing
[34:33] with are wanting to kill you because he
[34:34] was
[34:34] the jews that was wanting him dead i
[34:36] don't think the romans cared
[34:39] the gentile romans did not care they
[34:42] weren't
[34:43] they weren't calling for jesus blood but
[34:45] jesus the jews were calling for jesus
[34:47] blood
[34:48] so pilate was going your own people
[34:50] don't even believe you
[34:52] so you're no threat to me so what is
[34:54] truth
[34:55] yeah all right
[34:58] then we looked in matthew 25 and we see
[35:01] talked about the
[35:02] the 10 virgins and i really enjoyed that
[35:06] my own self talk about the 10 virgins
[35:09] because remember they are virgins
[35:12] and we can skim through it so then shall
[35:13] the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10
[35:15] virgins
[35:16] who took their lamps and went forth to
[35:17] meet the bridegroom now look five of
[35:19] them were wise and five were foolish so
[35:21] you've got
[35:21] five truth and five
[35:24] not truth all right yeah you got it
[35:27] that's right there's no there's not 11.
[35:31] no there's five wives and five foolish
[35:34] and not somebody just showed up in
[35:36] between no
[35:37] the wise but remember as i was preaching
[35:40] in kentucky
[35:41] look at verse five while the bridegroom
[35:46] tarried they all right
[35:50] like some of you doing right now
[35:52] slumbering and sleeping
[35:54] can't believe you fall asleep at 10
[35:56] o'clock in the morning
[35:57] but anyway it's cause you're not
[35:59] listening
[36:00] while the bridegroom terries they are
[36:02] all slumbered and slept
[36:04] now look they slumbered and slept the
[36:06] prophet told us through the
[36:07] denominations why they slept through the
[36:09] truth
[36:10] right all of them did now there's a true
[36:13] bride in every age but they all had
[36:16] false doctrine except for those first
[36:18] three church ages right
[36:19] that's right because when nicea came in
[36:22] and then they come into 606 which is
[36:24] about when this church age began
[36:26] they accepted all that junk and i said
[36:29] jump because it was junk
[36:31] boston holy ghost was not the right
[36:32] baptist right
[36:34] that's my brother said it came from the
[36:36] pits of hell because it had to come from
[36:37] a false
[36:38] spirit right it comes from a thought
[36:41] spirit brought that in it brought in the
[36:43] eternal hells and all the different
[36:45] doctrines
[36:46] that they can almost prove by the bible
[36:50] because they read the same bible we do
[36:54] the bible says the worm never dies
[36:56] hell's got to be eternal but how in the
[36:57] world
[36:58] can you take eternal life that god
[37:01] give you and put it in hell
[37:05] you can't do it that's it very simple to
[37:08] me that there's no eternal hell i
[37:10] i don't care what man says
[37:13] my bible says that hell was created
[37:16] for the devil and his angels it actually
[37:18] wasn't even created for humans we're
[37:19] just ones that are going there if we
[37:20] don't do what god said
[37:22] right amen so while the bridegroom
[37:24] tarried they all slumbered and slept
[37:26] and at the midnight look there was a cry
[37:28] behold the bridegroom
[37:30] broom cometh go out to meet him
[37:31] bridegroom and they both all 10 woke up
[37:34] yeah yep yeah that's what's strange they
[37:37] all ten woke up
[37:38] brother luis they all heard the call
[37:41] like i said before we were talking in
[37:42] kentucky
[37:44] all those doctrines that you that you
[37:46] all grew up with
[37:48] how that mama
[37:51] am i still alone yeah how that mama
[37:55] passed on and you know brother ray
[37:57] mcgovern he's over there
[37:58] walking with jesus down the street
[38:00] that's not true
[38:02] that's fine we had to have a prophet
[38:05] come in the end time go across the
[38:07] curtain of time
[38:08] see what was going on brought it back to
[38:10] us and exactly put it in the scripture
[38:16] that we're waiting for a place and a
[38:18] time
[38:20] that we can't see jesus
[38:24] but you're not seeing him right now when
[38:25] if you're in the i think
[38:28] brother ray he had that laugh
[38:32] didn't freddy you remember he had that
[38:34] laugh
[38:35] when he give a revelation or he'd want
[38:37] to talk anybody
[38:39] well i'll guarantee you when he walked
[38:40] across the curtain of time and he
[38:42] stepped over there
[38:43] he saw brother branham or somebody he
[38:44] knew and he went ha-ha-ha i made it
[38:47] it's a bit amazing i made it
[38:52] but see you remember those little things
[38:54] about people that you'll never forget
[38:56] right and i don't think he'll lose that
[38:58] when he stepped over across the curtain
[38:59] in time he won't
[39:00] lose that character of being brother ray
[39:02] montgomery amen
[39:04] because we all carry that character with
[39:06] us but at the midnight the cry came
[39:08] talking about those virgins look
[39:10] 10 were wise undeceived and
[39:14] ten were fully a five word wise
[39:16] undeceived
[39:17] five were foolish deceived right
[39:20] pretty much cut and dry right all right
[39:22] because this one had oil
[39:26] oh i gotta get back up here this one had
[39:29] oil
[39:30] and i'm not using one of them candy
[39:31] sticks over there i can't hold
[39:34] ice cream cone and preach
[39:37] one of these sorry
[39:41] so as the bridegroom called there's ten
[39:44] there was five that had
[39:45] oil and five that didn't that was the
[39:47] only difference
[39:49] right all right because look brother
[39:51] brown tells us in
[39:52] the ten virgins in 1960 now if you'll
[39:54] take that name
[39:55] virgin and run it down it means holy
[39:58] clean
[39:58] and sanctified right they had
[40:02] an experience right they just didn't
[40:05] take a furthermore of the word of god
[40:08] and how the seed word planted in their
[40:11] soul
[40:12] right yeah right that's right that's the
[40:14] only difference
[40:15] right they didn't take a furthermore of
[40:17] the word of god
[40:18] and even brother adam says even the
[40:20] brides down through the church jesus
[40:21] that's why he said it's been brought by
[40:23] his church's bride surprise
[40:25] they took part of the work but they
[40:27] didn't take all of it
[40:29] in other words they didn't let that baby
[40:31] that was formed in them mature
[40:36] that's right because we got we got have
[40:38] grown
[40:39] men grown gospel
[40:42] in this end time not baby form so
[40:45] sanctified
[40:46] but the only reason they were foolish
[40:48] was one thing
[40:50] they didn't continue on satan got in
[40:52] there so
[40:54] satan got in there somewhere that's
[40:56] right
[40:58] satan got in there somewhere
[41:02] if i go over there might change it it's
[41:04] almost over here
[41:06] satan got in there somewhere and said
[41:07] you're good remember i explained that
[41:09] the other day you're
[41:10] you're fine you're oh you quit all that
[41:12] stuff you used to
[41:13] didn't you right trap of the devil
[41:16] i know josh i got it turned over this
[41:18] way a little bit trap of the devil
[41:21] here you'll never see this again turn it
[41:25] on
[41:31] we're going to improvise
[41:34] now this won't work what do we do
[41:43] helen give me some give me some blue
[41:46] hey we good all right they can hear me
[41:49] anyway this would be for
[41:50] for going on the internet i guess so
[41:52] there we go we see that look
[41:55] brother brown said now there was the
[41:56] virgins ten virgins again
[41:58] continue the quote if you'll pull it up
[41:59] please now there was the virgins went
[42:01] out to meet him and the foolish virgins
[42:03] now did not have
[42:04] oil in their lamp but they had
[42:06] everything else
[42:08] they were clean they believed in christ
[42:11] they preached the word that they
[42:13] believed
[42:15] hear that right they believed their
[42:18] denomination would let
[42:20] all that denomination would let them
[42:21] preach
[42:23] because see let me let me ask you about
[42:25] something
[42:27] you take this message and you go
[42:29] preaching in a denominational church
[42:33] they'll hear you so far but then they'll
[42:36] send you back home
[42:38] why got to be a truth and got to be a
[42:42] false they're
[42:42] saying they have the truth and you're
[42:45] false
[42:47] but then when you take it back to the
[42:48] word they shut up because there's
[42:50] nothing
[42:51] in there to sound off
[42:55] there's nothing there to signal
[42:59] truth you say well now wait a minute
[43:03] they got
[43:05] i'm just telling you what the end time
[43:07] is producing
[43:09] it's produced twins and they're all
[43:12] both religious they're not we look and
[43:15] say well the truth is
[43:16] going to church and the false is staying
[43:18] at home watching football
[43:20] [Music]
[43:22] we deal with the true and the faults
[43:23] right here in our self
[43:26] much less what goes over the pulpit
[43:28] you've got to pray
[43:31] that you're hearing truth you've got to
[43:34] pray that you're hearing truth
[43:36] amen so let's go to john 17 verse 16.
[43:41] this is pretty clear
[43:44] okay all right they are not of the world
[43:48] even as i am not of the world jesus is
[43:50] praying right here this is
[43:51] to me this is the lord's prayer to the
[43:53] bride
[43:55] i know what the lord's prayer is but
[43:56] this is the lord's prayer specifically
[43:58] for
[43:59] jesus's people for his bride in the end
[44:02] times everybody got that say amen
[44:04] they are not of the world even as i am
[44:06] not of the world
[44:07] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[44:11] is truth as thou
[44:14] has sent me into the world even so i
[44:16] have also
[44:17] sent them into the world and for
[44:20] their sake i sanctify myself we know
[44:23] that jesus was
[44:24] a human being he had human desires
[44:27] because he was in a human body
[44:28] but he but he sanctified his self
[44:31] set himself apart nazarite vow whatever
[44:34] you want to call it
[44:35] so that he can have what listen this
[44:38] this junk of of people thinking jesus
[44:40] had a wife on earth and all this stuff
[44:42] you see these movies and all that stuff
[44:45] that's filth because look christ
[44:49] only had one bride he's only got one
[44:53] wife
[44:54] he didn't have an earthly wife and a
[44:56] heavenly wife
[44:57] he had one wife paul says i
[45:01] espouse you as a virgin
[45:04] to christ and christ was already gone
[45:08] and for their sake i sanctify myself
[45:10] that they
[45:11] also might be sanctified through
[45:14] part truth oh that's not what that says
[45:19] that they also might be sanctified
[45:21] through the truth
[45:24] i am the way the truth and the life
[45:28] second timothy verse three uh third
[45:30] chapter verse 6.
[45:32] now watch this because this is the group
[45:35] of people
[45:37] that are on the opposite side everybody
[45:39] got that say amen there is a true and
[45:41] there's a false
[45:42] listen but like i said before
[45:45] you and i is we're not obligated
[45:48] to say who's true and who's false
[45:52] like i said before if you got somebody
[45:54] in your mind that you think i'm thinking
[45:56] about right now
[45:58] my my mind is blank of
[46:01] names you can call names wherever you
[46:03] want to
[46:04] but i'm talking about the spirits that
[46:06] are motivating these people the spirits
[46:08] that are motivating
[46:09] all of us hey did you have truth from
[46:13] the day you were born
[46:14] right no some of you didn't have truth
[46:17] until about two or three years ago
[46:22] well you told me you didn't yeah
[46:26] well get quiet now would you yeah yeah
[46:30] so listen until we let me just put it
[46:32] this way until we
[46:33] rapture and our bodies change there will
[46:36] be a part error in us somewhere
[46:38] right everybody got that
[46:41] right up until the twinkling of an eye
[46:45] we're gonna have just enough oil like i
[46:48] said before about
[46:50] about the airplanes you know they just
[46:52] got just enough fuel
[46:54] to get them there you get just enough to
[46:57] get it
[46:58] we got just enough oil they said we
[46:59] don't have enough oil we
[47:01] in other words we don't have two or
[47:02] three years to try to bring you
[47:04] up you've been sitting here two or three
[47:06] years
[47:08] now that's where god can separate not me
[47:10] and you
[47:12] but look these people here having a form
[47:15] of godliness but denying the power
[47:17] thereof from such turn away
[47:18] for of this sword are they which creep
[47:20] into houses and lead captive silly women
[47:22] i hope that's not the
[47:24] heat that just turned on
[47:27] i hope it's air conditioner for this
[47:30] sort of they which creep into houses and
[47:31] lead captive
[47:32] women silly women women's what
[47:36] churches women are churches
[47:41] led away with divers lust ever
[47:44] learning and never able to come to the
[47:47] what
[47:48] knowledge of the truth
[47:52] knowledge of the truth listen there's
[47:55] only way one way you know the knowledge
[47:58] of the truth needs to be born again
[48:00] you are deceived until that happens
[48:02] we're all deceived
[48:04] right if i got that say amen now watch
[48:07] now as janice and jamers whistled moses
[48:10] so do these
[48:10] also what resists the truth he says oh
[48:13] they don't resist the truth
[48:15] preach the truth to them
[48:18] preach the truth to them you'll find out
[48:20] where it resists or not
[48:22] amen they will resist you
[48:25] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[48:27] concerning the faith
[48:29] but they shall proceed no further i like
[48:31] this
[48:32] for their folly shall be manifest into
[48:34] all men
[48:35] as theirs also was
[48:39] so now let's bring it down to the end
[48:40] time
[48:42] terrence said be short i'm going to be
[48:44] real short
[48:48] all right revelations three here we are
[48:50] in the end time
[48:52] this is our church age the laodicean
[48:56] church age this is ours
[48:58] so this is what this is our salutation
[49:00] to anybody that's living
[49:02] in this church age if i got that say
[49:04] amen
[49:06] and to the angel of the church of the
[49:09] laodiceans right
[49:12] these things saith the amen
[49:15] the faithful and true
[49:18] witness now read you what
[49:22] true means that word true means in just
[49:25] a minute
[49:26] the beginning of the creation of god so
[49:28] what's he doing he's bringing
[49:30] us back to the true revelation
[49:34] the faithful and true witness the
[49:36] beginning of the creation of god now
[49:38] what was the beginning of the creation
[49:39] of god
[49:40] this is the time now the world says in
[49:42] december
[49:43] we know that jesus was not born in
[49:44] december but anyway we go along with it
[49:47] just
[49:47] just to play just to be here and don't
[49:50] cause no stir
[49:53] but he was the beginning he was the way
[49:55] we should have come
[49:57] as a virgin-born baby
[50:02] by spoken word not by instrumentality of
[50:06] man
[50:07] prophecy god tells us that amen you and
[50:10] i
[50:12] had to though come the way we did
[50:14] because of the fall because of what eve
[50:16] did
[50:17] but remember what i said this is this is
[50:19] not true
[50:21] this is false
[50:24] so god had to come if he was going to
[50:26] say i am the way the truth and the life
[50:28] if he would have lied he would have just
[50:30] went to heaven and and disappeared
[50:34] right and we had all died and went to
[50:36] hell
[50:37] right because we were born in sin shape
[50:40] and iniquity you got it
[50:42] but he did not he came back on the day
[50:45] of pentecost
[50:47] and said i'm going to right this ship
[50:50] i'm going to turn this thing around
[50:52] i'm not just going to be with you i'm
[50:55] going to be in you
[50:57] and if the truth is in you somewhere
[50:59] folks we've got to come to the truth if
[51:01] you have the holy ghost
[51:06] or the bible's wrong or i can't stand up
[51:09] here and say
[51:10] that the word of god is the truth
[51:13] because jesus said
[51:15] sanctifies him through thy truth thy
[51:17] word is truth
[51:19] everybody got that now look the faithful
[51:22] and true witness the beginning of the
[51:24] creation of god bring it back up the
[51:25] greek lexicon
[51:28] is a latinos
[51:31] is that true that i pronounce that right
[51:33] liam
[51:35] she's she's got some greek in her so she
[51:38] hasn't done anything about cooking but
[51:39] she she's great so anyway i ate greek
[51:43] yogurt every morning
[51:44] so
[51:48] look that word true
[51:53] means that which has not only the name
[51:55] and resemblance
[51:57] but watch but the real nature
[52:00] corresponding to the name
[52:04] wow i like that the faithful and true
[52:08] witness in other words
[52:09] he's the only one and if you've got him
[52:12] inside of you
[52:13] you've got to have the same resemblance
[52:15] the same nature
[52:17] because it's the real nature
[52:18] corresponding to the name
[52:21] in every respect corresponding to the
[52:24] idea
[52:25] signified by the name amen
[52:30] that's why the bible says all heaven is
[52:31] named what jesus not just j-e-s-u-s
[52:35] brother brown said there's many jesus
[52:37] jesus we jesus is all over the place
[52:39] there's many jesus's
[52:40] but there's only one that takes the
[52:42] character
[52:43] and nature of the bible and matches it
[52:46] 100 percent
[52:48] jesus never never
[52:52] never did not correspond with the word
[52:55] he always corresponded with the word his
[52:57] nature was always of the war
[52:59] of the word not the world he said oh
[53:02] what about when he platted the ropes and
[53:04] that was god you never read the bible
[53:07] where he said god was angry
[53:12] right um you don't like a lot of things
[53:16] we do
[53:18] but in every respect i like this true
[53:21] witness now look
[53:22] i'm going to read you a quote where
[53:23] brother brown said now that doesn't mean
[53:24] at one time it was false
[53:28] but now all other false witnesses can't
[53:31] correspond to that
[53:32] right yeah right you got it for louise
[53:35] they can't correspond
[53:36] you correspond what to the name
[53:39] that's why we baptize in the name of the
[53:41] lord jesus christ that's what peter said
[53:43] on the day of pentecost that's what
[53:44] jesus was telling him to do
[53:46] by revelation when he said father son
[53:49] holy ghost because father is not a name
[53:50] son is not a name holy ghost is not a
[53:52] name
[53:52] look if i want to correspond to father
[53:57] what father
[54:00] whose father are you talking about
[54:01] there's probably about 4 billion i'm in
[54:03] the world
[54:05] but when i tell you lord jesus
[54:08] christ you know exactly who i'm talking
[54:10] about
[54:11] so that corresponds to the name in every
[54:15] respect corresponding to the
[54:16] idea signified by the name real
[54:20] true and genuine opposite to what is
[54:24] fictitious
[54:25] counterfeit imaginary simulated
[54:29] or pretended that's pretty good isn't it
[54:33] so he's the faithful and true witness
[54:35] but now watch
[54:36] let's see what
[54:39] the prophet said about this in the
[54:41] layout of seeing church age
[54:42] he is the true witness now this word
[54:46] true
[54:47] is the same word we saw back there in
[54:48] revelations 3 7.
[54:50] you recall that it does not mean true as
[54:53] in contrast to false
[54:54] in other words he wasn't the false
[54:55] witness down through the church ages and
[54:57] all of a sudden in the laodicean church
[54:58] age he became true
[55:00] no look what it means you recall that it
[55:02] doesn't
[55:03] does not mean true as in contrast with
[55:05] false it has a richer
[55:09] deeper meaning by far
[55:12] it expresses perfect realization
[55:15] in contrast to partial realization
[55:19] because the faithful and true witness in
[55:20] this end time is going to bring us to
[55:22] the truth not a truth
[55:26] right there we are it expresses perfect
[55:30] realization in contrast
[55:32] to partial realization
[55:36] amen now let's go to ephesians 1.
[55:41] ephesians 1 says in whom you also
[55:43] trusted what
[55:45] after right oh
[55:48] this burns up to always was eternal and
[55:50] this burns up the
[55:52] the uh listen we believe in eternal
[55:54] security we believe in internal security
[55:56] coming from god
[55:58] not that you can be eternally secured
[56:00] and then you can do whatever you want to
[56:02] that shows see but that's that's false
[56:05] doctrine that's been taught
[56:06] right yeah many times really i mean i'm
[56:10] not saying but you go to a funeral
[56:12] a good baptist boy died not too long ago
[56:14] and he hadn't been in church in 30 years
[56:16] but he got saved when he was nine years
[56:17] old back at a
[56:19] convention somewhere and that was his
[56:21] salvation but he lived like a dog
[56:22] and if he gave his life to god i hope he
[56:24] did but if he didn't then
[56:27] what's he dependent on he was dependent
[56:28] on a lie
[56:31] he was dependent on lie if we don't have
[56:34] the truth we are depending on a lie
[56:39] in whom also you trusted after
[56:42] that you heard the word of truth
[56:48] the gospel of your salvation and whom
[56:50] also after
[56:52] that ye believed you were sealed with
[56:54] that holy spirit of promise
[56:56] what else can we do brother wade you can
[56:58] get justified
[56:59] sanctified and then ask god to put
[57:03] that truth in your soul
[57:06] because you promised it amen
[57:10] and the scripture with promise is what
[57:12] repent
[57:14] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[57:15] christ for remission and sin and you
[57:17] shall receive
[57:20] the gift of the holy ghost what for this
[57:22] promise is to you
[57:24] and to your children now that's bible
[57:28] how are you going tonight
[57:30] right because you go over to matthew 28
[57:32] and 19 jesus said be baptized in the
[57:34] name of the father and of the son and
[57:35] the holy ghost
[57:36] what is the name of the father the son
[57:38] holy
[57:40] i like what brother brown said we were
[57:41] listening and he said he said no
[57:43] he said now listen i think brother brown
[57:44] said now listen
[57:46] he said peter was giving the keys to the
[57:48] kingdom
[57:50] in other words he was saying if peter
[57:52] said stand on your head to receive the
[57:53] holy ghost you'd have to stood on your
[57:54] head to receive the holy ghost right
[57:56] peter was given the keys jesus said
[57:58] whatever you bind on earth
[58:00] i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose
[58:02] on earth
[58:03] i'll loose in heaven so peter can't be
[58:06] contrary 11 days after jesus said what
[58:09] he did
[58:09] he can't be contrary 11 days later and
[58:12] tell you to be baptized a different way
[58:14] there's only one way to be baptized
[58:17] everything else is what
[58:18] false true false all right
[58:24] but after you believed you were sealed
[58:26] with that holy spirit
[58:28] of promise everybody got that so now
[58:30] let's go to revelations 22
[58:32] 7. i'll just stand right here because i
[58:34] got my little ice cream cone in my hand
[58:37] and he said unto me look these sayings
[58:42] are faithful and true i want to ask you
[58:44] a question
[58:45] how do you know that how do you know
[58:49] that
[58:50] that that bible is truth it was written
[58:53] by
[58:54] 20 something different men i think it
[58:55] was whatever
[58:58] how do you know that they were telling
[59:00] you the truth
[59:02] i'm asking you how do you know that
[59:04] because the jehovah witness is going to
[59:05] come in and tell you it says one thing
[59:07] mormons is going to write their own
[59:08] bible tell you another thing
[59:10] i work with two of them i know exactly
[59:11] what the belief is and i've read their
[59:13] bible and
[59:14] it's just it's just an addition which
[59:17] there is no addition because jesus told
[59:19] us
[59:19] at the end of this book in revelations
[59:20] 22 he said
[59:22] if you add something i'm going to add
[59:24] you the plagues
[59:26] if you take away i'm going to take away
[59:27] your name out of the book of life
[59:29] pretty clear and he said unto me these
[59:32] things that's what i was thinking well
[59:34] when i start i thought
[59:37] and i'm gonna be a little sarcastic how
[59:38] do we think john didn't
[59:40] why why what makes us think john didn't
[59:42] get all that from the devil
[59:44] because i'm sure when he was on the isle
[59:46] of patmos the devil was talking to him
[59:47] too
[59:48] he just wasn't now sure he was having a
[59:50] good time in the lord i know
[59:51] but how do we know that the devil didn't
[59:55] interject
[59:56] a little bit of this only one word off
[59:59] remember
[1:00:00] in 66 books
[1:00:05] and moses wasn't around for the first
[1:00:07] three of them two of them
[1:00:09] really he wrote about genesis right
[1:00:12] wrote about his own death
[1:00:13] so he wrote it pre-death how do we know
[1:00:16] he's telling us the truth
[1:00:21] because right here
[1:00:27] i can put my trust because i have
[1:00:30] faithfulness and that is the word of god
[1:00:35] that god can keep it straight we can't
[1:00:38] and he sent prophets that's why i don't
[1:00:41] understand why people don't realize we
[1:00:42] that we needed a profit
[1:00:44] we've needed profits all through the
[1:00:46] since the dawn of time
[1:00:48] we've needed a profit to come and
[1:00:50] straighten out or try to
[1:00:52] yeah right amen
[1:00:57] there's been minor there's been major
[1:00:58] but there have been prophets when
[1:01:00] lord needed to talk to israel he sent
[1:01:02] him a prophet
[1:01:03] when the lord needed to speak to us he
[1:01:06] sent us a prophet
[1:01:07] amen why don't we why can't we realize
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:12] and the lord god of the holy prophet
[1:01:14] sent his angel
[1:01:16] now how you know that was a right angel
[1:01:19] you see what john was doing
[1:01:20] john had to have the baptism of the holy
[1:01:24] ghost
[1:01:26] in order for him to say that because it
[1:01:28] rang true with what he believed
[1:01:30] amen come on
[1:01:35] sent his angel to show unto his servants
[1:01:37] the things which must shortly
[1:01:39] be done behold i come quickly blessed is
[1:01:41] he that keepeth the sayings
[1:01:44] well how do we know that
[1:01:48] you know why because when i open it i
[1:01:50] know it's god talking to me
[1:01:53] and it has not got convoluted or messed
[1:01:55] up or even paul says i looked through a
[1:01:57] glass darkly you see that glass where
[1:01:59] sister freda is that right there
[1:02:01] see that clear glass right there that's
[1:02:04] what paul says you
[1:02:05] down to the church ages that's what they
[1:02:06] look through right there can you see
[1:02:08] outside
[1:02:09] but you know there's an outside out
[1:02:10] there right you see well the sun you can
[1:02:12] see the light yeah
[1:02:13] but you don't know where it's at right
[1:02:17] but you could do it if you were looking
[1:02:18] through that glass outside this is the
[1:02:20] glass man you're looking through
[1:02:22] we're not looking through that glass
[1:02:24] darkly anymore
[1:02:27] paul said i'm going to do that but one
[1:02:29] day i'm going to see him face to face
[1:02:32] that's why god had to send us a prophet
[1:02:35] to help us
[1:02:38] and and get away from well we believed
[1:02:41] the teachings
[1:02:42] of william branham they were not the
[1:02:43] teachers away in teachings of william
[1:02:45] branham they were the true
[1:02:46] teachings of what the bible said
[1:02:50] amen they were the true teaching because
[1:02:52] this he was a faithful and true witness
[1:02:54] and
[1:02:55] i've got that same faithful and true
[1:02:56] witness living in me and every time i
[1:02:58] open this bible up oh sure it hurts it's
[1:03:00] a two-edged sword but what is it doing
[1:03:02] it's performing surgery supernatural
[1:03:05] surgery
[1:03:08] and my soul inside says amen
[1:03:12] that ain't nothing but the truth what
[1:03:14] had he right tap into
[1:03:15] the same thing all these writers did
[1:03:20] right john said there ain't nothing but
[1:03:22] the truth this is what's got to happen
[1:03:24] moses was writing the bible he said that
[1:03:26] ain't nothing but the truth what
[1:03:28] happened in the
[1:03:28] in the garden of eden i mean nothing but
[1:03:30] the truth when abraham had to be 99
[1:03:32] years old
[1:03:33] be changed back into a young man to have
[1:03:35] a child
[1:03:36] a mystery that the world knows nothing
[1:03:38] about
[1:03:41] but it's laying right there in the bible
[1:03:45] everybody got it say amen all right
[1:03:47] let's read this right here we'll be done
[1:03:49] number five queen of sheba bless that
[1:03:52] woman's heart
[1:03:54] she was hungering and thirsting for god
[1:03:56] and she laid in those animals with these
[1:03:58] gifts and perhaps she said
[1:04:00] this i'm going up i ain't going to take
[1:04:04] nobody else's word now this is the queen
[1:04:07] of sheba going to see who solomon the
[1:04:09] wisest man in the world
[1:04:10] at that time i'm going to take nobody
[1:04:13] else's word i'm going to find
[1:04:14] out for myself if it's the truth
[1:04:20] i'll support it
[1:04:23] if it isn't the truth i'll bring my
[1:04:26] gifts back
[1:04:28] that's a good idea if god's in it
[1:04:32] put everything behind it you got your
[1:04:35] soul your heart your mind your talent
[1:04:37] all that you've got give it to the glory
[1:04:39] of god if he isn't god
[1:04:41] then let it alone and find out where
[1:04:43] there is a god
[1:04:45] if it isn't the truth let it alone and
[1:04:47] find out
[1:04:49] what is truth amen
[1:04:53] didn't we wander around and we were
[1:04:55] almost like pilate
[1:04:57] what is truth there's a church on every
[1:04:59] corner that's got different names on it
[1:05:02] is god that confused
[1:05:06] are we that confused because we got them
[1:05:09] on every corner about it too
[1:05:11] number six god provided place of worship
[1:05:13] i think this is the last one
[1:05:17] and now at the end time we see the
[1:05:18] things happening the way they are
[1:05:20] there's a great warning amongst the
[1:05:23] elected people of god
[1:05:25] to find out what is right
[1:05:30] and it behooves us to know that
[1:05:34] now not somebody's theory but to know
[1:05:38] what is truth
[1:05:39] what the bible says is truth because
[1:05:42] it'll be too
[1:05:43] late one day wow
[1:05:47] the bridegroom call you'll either be a
[1:05:50] wise a foolish virgin or you won't even
[1:05:52] be considered in it
[1:05:54] and this may be the day so let's take
[1:05:56] real consideration of what god has said
[1:05:58] remember
[1:05:59] when god speaks the word i love this
[1:06:00] right here when god speaks a word
[1:06:02] he can never take it back
[1:06:06] brother john that's what i have to
[1:06:08] depend on there's not another addition
[1:06:11] to this bible
[1:06:13] book of maccabees they got a book of job
[1:06:15] they got a book of this they got a book
[1:06:16] of that which has some truth
[1:06:19] josephus was there during the time
[1:06:21] writing but there was a lot of things he
[1:06:23] wrote that
[1:06:24] god didn't see to put in the word amen
[1:06:27] god didn't seem to put it in the words
[1:06:29] i'm going to believe that this is what
[1:06:30] god put together for me
[1:06:32] the truth remember when god speaks a
[1:06:35] word he can never take it back
[1:06:38] he has to ever remain the same he can
[1:06:41] never say something now okay there was
[1:06:43] jesus standing
[1:06:44] before he was ascension and he said go
[1:06:46] into all world preach the gospel baptize
[1:06:48] the name of the father name of the son
[1:06:49] or the name of the father and of the son
[1:06:51] of the holy ghost
[1:06:53] but find me one place in history up
[1:06:55] until about 300
[1:06:57] a.d that anybody was baptized in that
[1:07:00] they took that
[1:07:01] title from the roman catholic church
[1:07:05] and i see a rome but everybody
[1:07:10] that was a true believer was baptized in
[1:07:12] the name of jesus christ
[1:07:14] read your bible there's not one place
[1:07:16] you ought to see these people's eyes go
[1:07:17] wide open when you go to the philippines
[1:07:18] and say
[1:07:19] ten thousand dollars to the first person
[1:07:22] that'll ever show me that
[1:07:24] you that there was any baptized anybody
[1:07:27] baptized in this bible
[1:07:28] other than the lord jesus christ or
[1:07:30] jesus christ i'll give you ten thousand
[1:07:31] dollars
[1:07:32] boy you ought to see them in that
[1:07:33] mystery expo their bible they just are
[1:07:35] flipping through it
[1:07:36] you can't find it because it ain't in
[1:07:37] there
[1:07:40] they've been told what their truth is
[1:07:43] what their truth is is the truth but it
[1:07:46] was error
[1:07:48] but you watch them when they see that
[1:07:49] water baptism when they see the
[1:07:50] different things
[1:07:52] well you know then there's something
[1:07:53] that's striking down here
[1:07:56] and then as soon as they do what they do
[1:07:59] they listen
[1:08:00] you don't have to leave a denominational
[1:08:02] church when you believe this message
[1:08:05] you just start talking among the people
[1:08:08] you'll be extracted and excommunicated
[1:08:12] you'll be given as brother ernie says
[1:08:14] the right foot of fellowship
[1:08:17] out the door why because there's truth
[1:08:21] and there's error and they cannot how
[1:08:24] can two walk and not agree
[1:08:27] to walk together right here we'll finish
[1:08:29] remember when god speaks a word he can
[1:08:31] never take it back
[1:08:33] so in other words he didn't say father
[1:08:34] son holy ghost and then he go come over
[1:08:36] here and say well now peter's going to
[1:08:37] say
[1:08:38] no remember when god speaks a word he
[1:08:42] can never take it back he has to ever
[1:08:44] remain the same
[1:08:46] he can never say something and then say
[1:08:48] well i didn't exactly mean that
[1:08:51] boy that's pretty powerful to know that
[1:08:53] he gave us 66 books of the bible written
[1:08:55] by 20 different people
[1:08:57] and he tells you that's the truth right
[1:09:00] right and written
[1:09:01] i mean moses was like what 6 000 years
[1:09:03] ago 5 000 years ago
[1:09:06] thousands of years ago and then god
[1:09:09] comes down
[1:09:09] and gets everybody together and compiles
[1:09:12] it
[1:09:13] lets the king james
[1:09:16] get together and start compiling
[1:09:18] wycliffe and all the different ones
[1:09:19] start compiling it
[1:09:21] and it not be wrong
[1:09:24] i just got to believe that's the only
[1:09:25] true true thing there ever is is this
[1:09:28] bible
[1:09:30] he has to ever remain the same he can
[1:09:32] never say something and say well i
[1:09:33] didn't exactly mean that
[1:09:34] see he's infinite he wrote this bible
[1:09:38] before we were even formed
[1:09:41] this bible was written before the
[1:09:42] foundation of the world
[1:09:45] how can it be wrong if it was written
[1:09:46] then
[1:09:48] he had but he had to have a conduit
[1:09:50] right he had to have a conduit he had to
[1:09:52] have a way
[1:09:54] to get it pinned so that me and you can
[1:09:56] read it
[1:09:57] then he came down his self in flesh and
[1:09:59] he said okay whatever you're fixing to
[1:10:01] hear
[1:10:02] i'm the way i'm the truth and i'm the
[1:10:05] life
[1:10:07] all right look he is infinite he knows
[1:10:10] the best
[1:10:11] to begin with we say things that we
[1:10:14] think is best and after a while we
[1:10:16] take it back how many of you have done
[1:10:17] that no don't worry i'll raise all your
[1:10:19] hands
[1:10:21] you're lying if you keep it down okay so
[1:10:23] we pray for liars too
[1:10:25] but he knows the best we say things that
[1:10:26] we think is best and after a while we
[1:10:28] take it back
[1:10:30] but god can't do that and remain god
[1:10:34] so if he's infinite he does not do that
[1:10:38] because he is perfect in every word
[1:10:42] he never utters a word unless
[1:10:45] it's eternal glory wow
[1:10:51] so how what are you what are we doing
[1:10:53] with all these people i mean message
[1:10:55] and denominate they're changing the
[1:10:56] bible
[1:11:02] all of his eternals
[1:11:06] that's us was with him at the beginning
[1:11:09] his thoughts his attributes
[1:11:11] and they're only expressing themselves
[1:11:14] in the world
[1:11:15] today so where is the truth
[1:11:20] the the truth is right here inside of
[1:11:22] you if you have the baptism of the holy
[1:11:23] ghost it's the same guy
[1:11:26] that spoke that the same person
[1:11:31] that spoke it is inside of you how can
[1:11:34] he say
[1:11:34] something different than what he's
[1:11:37] already said
[1:11:39] he cannot say anything different he
[1:11:41] can't go against his word oh sure
[1:11:43] he can send you a prophet that can help
[1:11:45] you out
[1:11:46] as in paul and moses and brother branham
[1:11:49] are given a grace and marriage and
[1:11:50] divorce
[1:11:51] he said but it was because of
[1:11:52] misinterpreted theology
[1:11:56] we must get away from misinterpreted
[1:11:58] theology
[1:12:02] this world's full of it
[1:12:12] let me read this one quote the unfailing
[1:12:13] reality is living god in 1960 stand your
[1:12:15] feet
[1:12:16] musicians come we'll sing a song before
[1:12:18] we go
[1:12:19] make sure you get to the back of the
[1:12:21] door let brother terrence give you an
[1:12:23] envelope
[1:12:24] look you know a woman is the type of the
[1:12:26] church
[1:12:27] we're the bride everybody got that we're
[1:12:29] the bride
[1:12:30] the church is the bride there's a lot of
[1:12:32] brides
[1:12:34] and yet they let them women entice them
[1:12:37] the ministers today let them churches
[1:12:39] pull them
[1:12:40] off from the truth what if you don't
[1:12:43] preach the truth they'll just kick you
[1:12:45] out
[1:12:45] send you someone you know put you out
[1:12:47] and what does she do she cuts her hair
[1:12:49] she cuts off her power she has her way
[1:12:52] end time seed sign brother brown said in
[1:12:54] the face of all this there is a real
[1:12:55] bride that god's bringing forth
[1:12:59] each time there's been a reformer
[1:13:01] there's been so much of the word spread
[1:13:02] forth
[1:13:03] and each generation gets it did you ever
[1:13:06] notice
[1:13:06] they'll be a man of god come along
[1:13:08] strike a fire with god there'll be a
[1:13:10] great revival and what happens
[1:13:11] immediately after they take that man's
[1:13:13] idea
[1:13:14] they denominate it and bring in creeds
[1:13:16] and mix with it
[1:13:17] there she dies and never rises again
[1:13:21] but each generation what does it get it
[1:13:23] gets an opportunity at the fresh word of
[1:13:25] god each time
[1:13:27] like luther under justification western
[1:13:28] under sanctification pentecostals moving
[1:13:30] on the baptism the holy ghost
[1:13:32] each one gets his chance that what the
[1:13:34] that's then
[1:13:35] what does the man that follow the great
[1:13:36] reformers they denominate it
[1:13:38] organize it mix it with creeds a little
[1:13:40] bit here a little bit there a new bunch
[1:13:42] of school scholars
[1:13:44] he says death he said they died
[1:13:49] spiritually and that's the way it's
[1:13:51] always been
[1:13:52] the truth will never die that's why
[1:13:55] jesus said i am the way sure he had to
[1:13:56] die in flesh but that man inside of him
[1:13:58] was not
[1:14:00] dying i'll promise you that man inside
[1:14:02] of you
[1:14:03] that's what took brother ray over into
[1:14:05] that other dimension
[1:14:07] that that that thing that was formed in
[1:14:09] him at his new birth
[1:14:11] took him right over into that next
[1:14:13] dimension and there he was with brother
[1:14:15] branham and all the different ones that
[1:14:16] he knew they'd went on across the
[1:14:17] curtain of time
[1:14:19] sometimes brothers and sisters we envy
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:23] yeah amen but we've got a job to do
[1:14:26] until that because you and i
[1:14:29] have a job that we are ordained of god
[1:14:31] not to be in another church age were we
[1:14:33] okay with this doctrine and okay with
[1:14:35] that doctrine
[1:14:38] this word right now is pure just like
[1:14:40] when jesus stood on the
[1:14:42] listen when jesus stood on earth he
[1:14:45] wasn't creating a denomination
[1:14:48] but what if they based everything off of
[1:14:50] all the denominational ideas have been
[1:14:52] based off what brother bruham said the
[1:14:54] people that comes in and preaches the
[1:14:55] message
[1:14:56] somebody grabs it satan grabs it and
[1:14:58] twists it
[1:14:59] just like they grabbed this message and
[1:15:01] twisted it but there's a true bride
[1:15:04] there's been brides brides churches
[1:15:06] brides churches how many times did he
[1:15:07] say that
[1:15:08] he said but will come one and i contend
[1:15:11] that this is it

[1:15:16] else
