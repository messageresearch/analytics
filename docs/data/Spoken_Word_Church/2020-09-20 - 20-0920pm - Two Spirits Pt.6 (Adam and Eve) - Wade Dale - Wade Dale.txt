eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining pour out your [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy and holy thank you lord amen holy holy holy you are holy holy holy [Music] amen you want to see him turn around look at each other and there's where god is today he's right here not just among his people he's in his people and he's a wonderful wonderful friend all the different titles we can give him but daddy our papa god our father kind of brings it on home you know he's a lot of different things he's he's a rose of sharon he's lily of the valley bright morning star he's all the different things but he is our father hey man good to be in the house with lord good to be here got a good crowd up here and i know there's a little bit of a crowd downstairs that's good maybe we'll get them all back together one day brother dardy and we can all worship in the same room but we all worship the same god it doesn't matter where we're at so uh god bless you uh if you got your bibles let's turn to first john 4 let's continue on the two spirits today we're going to speak on uh if you bring the two spirits in you've got to go back to the garden of eden as we were with satan and our lucifer and and god and then also you got to bring in adam and eve and you got to see that it's like brother dale's talking about but you got to see the transition because god started out everything spiritual and then it it it transmitted down to natural all right so we've got a natural body in the spiritual body as we're talking about there in the corinthians we'll get to that maybe later on today if not that's okay but there was a spiritual man made first then there was a natural man made and during the time of that making of the natural man is where we see the fall come in and then we see two different seeds are two different not lines of lineage but we do see it begin as two lines of lineage and we'll cover that today because the bible tells us that adam didn't say adam was the father of all living it said eve was the mother of all living so there's a there's a revelation in there that there must been a a seed of discrepancy come in i listened to that message a couple of nights ago and that's really good it's a short message but boy it was really powerful on the seat of discrepancy there in arizona but that seed of discrepancy came in and and remember too it's not so much and we'll read it maybe later on it's not so much as the natural seed that got planted it was the spiritual seed that got planted in the mine first because everything has to start up here you've got to be contacted up here this is where everything's got to start from you can accept or reject from right here and then your body just what your body just manifests what you're thinking amen that's why the bible tells us you know if we should have the mind of christ well if you have the mind of christ then you should act like him okay we didn't get a brain transfer but we do have the mind of christ in our soul by the new birth all right so everybody cool and good remember brother chris long will be your wednesday that was a good surprise that he's moving in he's preaching for brother jewell today at the new church so just pray for him he'll be here in a few days and be speaking for us on wings tonight so other than that i don't think there's any new announcements other than just pray for everybody you see the prayer list or continuing to get longer um and it's it's just the devil so we just we just don't um we don't believe that he's stronger than we are he is not there's no weapon formed the scripture tells us this is going to take us down unless god wants us to leave and when god's ready for us to leave time to go amen all right if you're a christian if you're not a christian you better be careful when you say that you don't know where you're going but we as believers know where we're going amen so the lord bless you and be with you keep us all in your prayers as we continue on this two spirits coming down from all the way from the beginning back before the beginning all the way down to now so first john 4 verse 1 let's bow our heads dear lord jesus thank you for this day that you've given us thanks for the time and fellowship we've had today lord now pray that we now would focus our attention to fellowship around the word of god focus around the anointing that's here lord the true anointing that come to anoint the word lord as we speak father may you anoint the people to hear songs have been sung all the things ordinances of the church has been done now we've come to this place lord where you speak to us father we pray that you just be with the ones that are sick we know many ones brother claude says george jackson the different ones that lord we've been in contact with just having a hard time father but we know that greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world and we pray that you would send that anointing to them father and that you would heal them and touch them today father forgive us of our sins bless us and guide us by your holy spirit give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses lord we pray in jesus name amen all right this would be part six we're going to talk a little bit about adam and eve and how that got started i know we all pretty much in this building know that right up front it wasn't an apple that eve ate and gave it to to uh to adam or pomegranate or any kind of fruit if not then we need to start eating fruit again because it's totally it showed that they were naked and we need to start eating apples again i guess to show that we're naked because of people taking off clothes more now than they ever have so i i don't think that's what it was i think that we we're going as we go through this you know as well as i do that it was hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed and to babe such it would learn such as would learn it's it's been hidden from centuries and generations and now was revealed not only just in the end time i i i'm like brother dale i think the even the pharisees in the old testament coming they were in the old testament you know jesus was in the old testament okay new testament didn't start till the day of pentecost so they were they knew that they knew what happened in the garden they knew there wasn't wasn't an apple or a pomegranate or in other words why did if it was an apple or an orange or something why didn't if that was the shame that was caused in the garden why didn't they make glove fig leave gloves as brother ernie says and why didn't they cover their mouth with a with a fig leaf no they covered them other parts with a fig leaf because they knew what they had done and it wasn't uh the way god wanted because remember we talked the other day about spoken word seed the only the only person in the whole entire universe that can speak a word and it come to pass directly as he thought it is god almighty satan cannot do that you and i can't do that but the word of god can do that the creator that stood and said let there be it had to happen all right and it had to happen the way he said it would happen so when he said every seed would bring forth of its kind he meant what he said and he said what he meant all right so now look now we go on now we're already now in the new testament and here's the little john's by john the revelator telling us here beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and many times i've said before that doesn't mean a drunk on the side of the road you say do you believe jesus christ has come in the flesh and he goes yeah that don't mean he's safe amen that confesseth in other words your confession your daily walk your your what you say the things that even your thoughts should be pure and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist where have you ever heard that it should come and even now already as in the world that was in 1896 ye are of god little children have overcome them because greater is he thus in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them you know that's why just for a minute while you're standing it keeps you awake longer that's why that we should not look like the world that's what it tells us right here we should not look like the world we have to mingle with the world we have to go to walmart and we have to go to these different places and but we i want them to know that we're different and the only way they're going to know that we're different is is by our actions reactions what we do what we wear what we listen to amen that's the only way they can tell any difference now maybe with your sister's a little bit different because you don't cut your hair as the bible tells you not to and doesn't wear pants as the bible tells you not to but that's what the bible is telling us he said look we're not segregationalists but god is a segregationalist he told israel he said don't you marry those people right keep your lying pure don't you do that now what does he tell us here in the spiritual in paul and john and all the different ones he says don't partake of the world don't do what the world does if you do what the world does you're of the world okay but we want to be called out of that and be separated from the world because you know what the world the world mammon the world mammon does not have god in it god is only he's not in trees he's not in houses he's not in buildings he's in people he's either in you or not in you there's no gray area no halfway there no amen they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth now there's your one spirit and the spirit of error there's your other spirit all right you may be seated in the lord that is blessing to the reading the word we're going to fly through this pretty quick at first and get in back into the book of genesis because i want to bring some things out here is that okay ezekiel 28 verse 11. you have to excuse me moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tirus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealeth up to some full of wisdom and perfect in beauty now who's he talking about he's talking about the devil or lucifer all right lucifer was created first he was created beautiful he was not created ugly he was created perfect amen all right thou hast been in eden the garden of god now there's your key because we're going to put him directly into the garden of eden and show how this thing happened called the fall and it wasn't that he brought even apple and the tree of life is not a literal tree and the tree of knowledge and good and evil is not a literal tree okay it's the two spirits that we're talking about all right it's it's the two things that god said you can eat this one and live or you can eat this one and die right all right there is no tree that you can eat now and live forever and there is no tree now there may be a tree that you can eat that poisons you and kills you but that's in the natural but when you i want you to see this we'll look at in the garden i want to show you something about a little um a punctuation mark or or something that'll tell us the kind of the story and i know i'm not a english major but i do know a little bit about english but look at that word right there says thou has been eaten the garden of god you see that that's called a semicolon everybody see that i just looked it up it's got to be the truth i just looked it up on the internet right in there that evil thing called a semicolon it's used to connect independent clauses it's not a period and start over again it it connects in that right night line neither shaking the head uh-huh she's been she's been an english class you have not slept in the english class so thou has been in eden in the garden of god semicolon now if this is connecting it together but it's not starting a new sentence it says it's telling what he is every precious stone was not covering the stardust topaz the diamond barrel onyx the remember the comma is ongoing jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tablets and thy pipes were prepared and then the day that thou was created so when no one thinks for sure god created lucifer god created the devil all right he didn't create him the devil he created him lucifer the anointed cherub the one to stand by his side the one to be anointed to to be god's right-hand man wow what about that well he had to come from somewhere and if all life comes from god then god had to give him that life but listen that life that satan had is just the same life as me and you have and the point is you and i have a choice to make between doing right with it or wrong with it he had the same choice to do right with it to do wrong with it all right because he give cain the same thing he gave all of us the same choice even as i read the quotes from brother brown said all the angels were give were given a choice because part of them went with satan so obviously they had a choice because god didn't create all them bad angels he created angels and they became bad as they go along and start listening to what satan had to say listen satan is the slickest character you'll ever meet you'll never meet nobody more deceiving than the devil listen god almighty will never deceive you never he will never give you a deception because he's truth and he's all truth and he's the only truth but satan as he opens his mouth he's a deceiver he's going to try to trip you up he's going to try to deceive you because he is of that other spirit all right everybody got that say amen satan is not your friend he's not your companion though he may be closer to you than than god is most of the time i don't know about you but he is with me but the bible tells us to resist the devil and they'll flee from you that's that's pretty that's really hard to do sometimes it is hard to do but it's the easiest thing in the world to do so let's go to genesis 1 26 and read this because this is what we're going to get to today and and listen everybody that's sitting in this building except for a few have known that we preached on genesis 1 26 for years it's my favorite scripture in the bible because it tells me of me that's not every human being no that's not every human being that was ever created that is a special group of people that came out of god the children of god the one he has that portrait album of before the foundation of the world that is not i'm trying to say this that's not sinners that's not this is this is a special brother dale said this morning exactly what i was going to tell you genesis 1 26 is a special designation of god it's not another god that's right right it's an extension or a manifestation of that same god or you've got back to your trinitarian doctrine of three persons in a trinity which is not not even in the bible and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness so whatever he made that person you might want to say it can't be another person but that being whatever he made it was him it was like him looked like him acted like him and they have a dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air so they have a dominion over the cattle and over all the earth all the earth all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man now remember that word created just flying through what we spoke of many years ago brother dale spoke of it many years before i did so god created that word created is not there was nothing and then there's something right right that word created means formed all right so he formed a man in his own image in the image of god create how did he form him he formed him by the word he fought he formed him by that spoken word seed that we're talking about that we've been talking about i was reading the other day and brother ryan was telling us he said the first the first adam was a spoken seed word the second adam was a spoken seed word god came down and put the egg and the and the germ inside of mary and came forth jesus christ the beginning of the creation of god the way that it should have been had there not been a fall and we're going to find that out because it's going to reverse back to where you and i now are spoken word seed children but we had to come by that desire of a man and a woman that's what i was telling you a long time ago i don't care who you are how much money you make how good looking or how ugly you are we all came from the same act every one of us bar none we all came from that same act because of what happened in the garden so don't tell me it was uh well now bob black now he eat bananas and and had them children and i eat grapes and i had mine kind of foolish isn't it well that's how we think when we think that what happened in the garden had to do with natural fruit amen don't fall asleep on me so god created man in his own image and the image of god created him so whatever it was this was a god man a god man male and female created he them and god blessed them listen before you even came on the face of the earth you're blessed and god said to them be fruitful and multiply oh now brother way that means that you're going to y'all going to start having children no that means one thing's for sure that having natural children is the only way we can get here now because of what happened in the fall but by spiritual birth we are being fruitful and multiplying now by spiritual multiplication brother dale started this church with 12 people now there's been hundreds you say hundreds yeah there's been people moved through here and had other went to other churches there's been people come here and even created other churches all right from here so there to me is the spiritual multiplication that's when jesus was telling the people that i'm going to come back and i'm not going to be just with you i'm going to be in you all right so by spiritual multiplication he is absolutely fulfilling genesis 1 26-28 that's why i love it because listen that's god's children that's not the children of the devil that's not the foolish virgin that's not that is the children of almighty god because they are an extension of him they are actually they have his dna when you get born again your dna is the dna of almighty god in your soul but your mama and daddy had to get you here by natural dna that's why i said there's a natural seed and a spiritual seed all right so now we're going to take that back to the garden because they're in the beginning all right and god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth in other words god said hey y'all take care of the earth i'll take care of heaven i'm going to give you dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air so it had to be the earth it couldn't have been somewhere else like mars or venus or anything like that it had to be the earth he gave us he gave dominion to this group of people but now remember this group of people were are going to come in continuance if there had not been a fall we would have all been in the garden of eden but you know what god's got an attribute called savior god's got an attribute called healer god's got a rose of sharon lily of the valley the the balm in gilead that is inside of god and he had to get those attributes out and to get those attributes out he had to allow sin to enter the picture that's why you say oh now well now god he created a lucifer just for that purpose no he created loose for perfect what the bible says satan is the one lucifer is the one that that turned the table and he's the one that got all the evil he didn't get that from god because we're going to see here in a minute even in a natural setting but just really i want you to be careful when we start into this because in the beginning there was two seed lines i said in the beginning but we're going to prove either today or next week that that thing got so mingled even the tower of babel god just confused everybody sent part of the people this way part of them this one so you can't when the bible says the sons of god came and saw the daughters of men and started mingling you can't find a seed line anywhere it's just all corrupt the prophet of god tells us if i have time i read it that adam's seed literally polluted this whole earth because remember a woman doesn't have a seed a woman has to receive seed everybody got that we know that for a fact a woman has to receive seed because that's what we're going to read in the garden maybe well we won't get to genesis 3 today maybe but in genesis 3 god says i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman all right so remember we have to receive the seed word of god to be children of god you don't just come here with it it's not just automatic it's not just you're born with it you have to receive it all right so that genesis 1 26 whatever that is to me i'm just telling you that is the children of almighty god that is what god that's what satan can't he can't understand that right this is one part of the scripture that satan cannot understand is how god can divide himself into a multiple form called a bride and still be one person because we're going to find out in a minute if we're a type if the bride and christ is a type of a natural bride adam and eve the bible tells us that she was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh now june and i have been married 41 years and there she's not bone in my bone because she has a different dna because of what happened in the fall but now literally adam and eve if you were to take them today and bring them down here and put them in a a lab you take them to a scientist and a scientist says there's no way these two people can have the same dna but they did because the rib came out and he formed a woman amen so they were literally when adam said she is bone of my bone and flesh in my flesh well by the power of transformation that's another good sermon for you to listen to by the power of transformation by the power of god that released right here you and i are one with him bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh amen by the baptism of the holy ghost you and i are changed into the image of almighty god amen all right exposition of the seven church ages this is what the quote i'm gonna read every time so you just get used to it see if you can memorize it now remember this christ in the true church now this now listen there's false church and there's true church but remember it's two churches remember the two spirits we're talking about not evil so much as evil of as uh the world would call evil like we see murders and rapes and all these different things sure that is a manifestation of that other spirit but that's not that that's not that apex of that of that spirit the apex of that spirit is sitting here today the apex of satan's spirit is sitting here today not out there in the world amen he's trying to deceive us he's already got them he's trying to deceive the true bride because if she gets what the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempt the destruction of god's people see that's why you see that genesis 1 26 man satan is not trying to destroy nobody but that whoever that was god's talking about he knows if he gets them he's got god right because they're a part of god and they're so secret that satan can't understand satan can't understand the new birth you receive saint can i understand why that zach black two days before he got born again was xyz i don't drinking smoking cussing gambling you won't do that but whatever and then all of a sudden two days later you know you give your heart to the lord everything's cleaned out and satan comes back in and goes and and bro zach opens the door and goes it's full in here shuts the door back it's full of the holy ghost in here and satan sees a power and feels a power that he's never felt before so you know what he does he said uh he's not gonna quit satan's not a quitter no he's going to go oh you got a spirit you got memory reason and conscious affection we're going to get into this because this is how slick he was to eve he couldn't get to eve's soul he couldn't blacken her soul because she was part of that genesis 1 26 man male and female hey wake up goodness gracious 15 minutes come on maybe if we were playing clemson and georgia we're playing we'd anyway but you got a different spirit that you're dealing with now and satan can only go to that second realm remember he can't even go to the first round that's me that's that's see tastes phil smelling here that only reacts to what that second person is or that third person is or the third third realm not person you don't have me if you're have many persons you got a problem you're a little bit schizophrenic but but satan can't understand that how he can't get back in there now and he how that he he motivates you by the same thing he started to motivate you before and it don't work right that's right because all of satan's subjects he's like drink some more and they go okay ain't no problem let's go to the beer joint look zach let's drink some more i don't do it anymore huh you don't do that anymore how'd that happen it's a miracle that's a miracle because we're going to show you here in just a few minutes and the longer y'all sleep the longer i'm going to preach trust me okay so get rested up real good and sleep a little while we'll do this in intervals because look when we get to the garden of eden satan didn't come in and say there is no god he's a liar ah he walks in and he puts one word [Music] god said the day you eat thereof i've got it written here we'll see it that day you die that day you'll surely die all satan done has come in and said thou she waited she said she said no of every tree we can eat and all this stuff we'll get to in a minute but he says you won't surely you'll not not you'll not surely die all he put was not in there he said everything god said except one word one word he didn't deny that there wasn't a god he didn't deny that that eve was a child of god he didn't deny that no he was just telling him what he what god had already said multiplying replenishing here all right so anyway so he knows that if the people get the true revelation that's what we're trying now we're trying to get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for see we got to know where we come from know what we're doing here and know where we're going if we know we came from that genesis 1 26 man we cannot lose we've already won he has preserved that i'll clap he has preserved that satan can't bother it oh he bombed you say oh satan don't bother you he can't bother that inside guy your soul it is well with my soul i love that song thank you brother michael it could be well with your soul and all hell breaking loose everywhere else but it can be well with your soul what about a man that lost all of his kids and and and his wife says everything's okay and he and he goes across and goes across the same place where the where the place sunk where he lost his kids and and writes that song most of us would go crazy but he said when peace like a river i tend this my way when sorrows like seas but will troll whatever my lot i'm here to say it as well with this guy down inside here oh he probably cried nights and he probably cried over the grave and all the different things but you know there was one thing inside of him look at what he pinned he pinned that thing all the way down to the change of the body about the trump and the shout and the voice he had a revelation because he knows he's coming back if he's born again he knows he's coming back he knows he's getting his kids back he knows he's getting his wife back everything's coming right back to what that garden of eden condition so that's what we're doing what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of what the two spirits within the framework of the christian church so now today we're going to talk about the christian church but it's going to be called the garden of eden everybody they'll be okay with that that's going to be the garden of eden is going to be the christian church that we're talking about today and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her all right let's read number two greatest battle ever fought this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angel it first started the first battle within heaven so sin did not originate in heaven it originated on earth so remember sin originated in the spirit realm first not the act in the garden no it started before the foundation of the world when lucifer preached to his art angels or two angels that believed him and michael preached to his listen they weren't up there having to knock down dragon no they were fighting words all right they were fighting spirits were fighting each other they weren't up there whoever's the you know whoever's the strongest we knew who the strongest was satan just gave up and said okay i'm going to try to deceive this bunch over here and i'll take them with me and they did so the first battle was in heaven then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan what come to destroy god's creation amen what god had created to be for himself because remember oh listen all the original creation why do we call it why do we call it a fall because we fell from something amen right yeah pretty simple fall the garden happened the fall but what happened before that peace joy love harmony god and man talking together lip to ear face to face isn't that what we're going back to that's what we're heading toward all satan done was put a gap in there for for god to display his attribute of savior and healer and redeemer and then it's going to close right back up and we're going to go right back into an eden again so satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth began where in us and has been raging ever since all right now let's go and read this quote and then we'll start right here we'll go back to the bible we're going to do everything in the bible today the expedition the seven church ages can you see past me i know i'm losing a little bit of weight so you can see a little bit better i'm i'm watching i've been watching my weight for years now i'm doing weight watchers it's just a play on words you know so did you get it now there are these twins again now remember there's always two always twins there are these two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain the bible tells us you know the rain falls on the just and the unjust the rain listen the rain i hate it though but the rain falls on all my weed seed in my garden as much as it falls on my corn and beans and potatoes because trust me i've been down on my hands and knees this week digging them up but you know what they benefit from the same rain they benefit from the same sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god give it that's the tree of life and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did cain who ended up killing abel but fear not little flocks stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan wow what about that when the church lets it go now last week we were talking about right here the law of reproduction there is a law that god put into into motion and it's been that way ever since and it always will be that way you know but you know why that satan is so slick he was standing there watching this and he's like uh i think i figured out a way to get in here because remember satan doesn't have a seed he can't create he can only pervert so he perverts what god's already created everybody got that amen and god said now this is genesis 111 right at the beginning of the bible listen genesis is the seed chapter that everything that happens in in the whole world today came from the book of genesis and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself we do not want to we're not deceived when we plant corn seed it looks like corn acts like corn when you plant it in the ground you're not expecting beans because every seed see we even know that when god put that in motion every how many thousands of years ago on the face of the earth he put that in motion and it is the only thing man has done is hybrid he's took and crossed it and all these different things that's why we're in such a bad shape that we're in we're not eating true seed but now remember all these seeds came from where spoken word of god every see everything comes from the spoken word of god the herb yielding seed the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was sown and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielded fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind so every seed is going to bring forth of its kind now that's already set in motion god put that in motion that is for the natural and the spiritual is that okay and god saw that it was good so he's going to keep it that way now let's go down to the 20th verse let's skip down god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that hath life the fowl that fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven now remember we don't believe in darwin's theory of evolution we believe in creative evolution amen where god created the lord form and he keeps creating and creating and creating and you go all the way up to the monkey and then he didn't skip to the man i've been reading some articles on the missing link how many of you have heard about the missing link we all have even in our school probably more prevalent than than because they're trying to deny it now in the articles that i'm reading they're trying to deny that there was a missing link but the problem is is they come up to monkey and then there's a big jump to man and there's a gap in there that's why they call it the missing link right because in creative evolution what happens god created the small things then he comes up and remember the last next to the last day before he created man what he created beast of the field and all those different things everybody got that so we believe in creative evolution chickens all the way up monkey whatever you want to say chimpanzee and there had to be a creature in between man and the monkey because god can't break his creative evolution in creating every seed had to bring forth of its kind there had to be a specie here a specie here a specie here and now we got a species that our blood won't coincide with the monkey now right sure we may look like one and most of us act like one yes hey man louise says yeah just don't go pick and flee but you see that and man has said oh man look that's this ape and all these different things they're they're right up against us but they can't they can't procreate with man man can't procreate with animal why we'll find out in a minute god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which is the water brought forth abundantly after their kind and every wing fell after his kind and god saw that it was good and god blessed them and said look be fruitful and multiply he made male and female dog male and female cat male and female whale male and female chicken the egg didn't come first the chicken came first and they started having eggs be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the sea and let fowl multiply the earth and the evening in the morning were the fifth day and god said let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind cattle creeping things and beasts of the earth after his kind now remember there was an animal in the bible called the beast and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good and god said let us make man i'm fix i'm fixing to finish here this is my last creation right here i'm going to create this is the highest form that i'm going to create is right here and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man our formed man in his own image and the image of god created in him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea now remember here's a key you see that word and subdue it now that means you had dominion and you had they were all subject to that man that was exactly the way it was before the fall adam had complete control and eve had complete control of all the earth of all nature of all the animals everybody got that say amen but now remember when the flood happened and noah and the boys come out of the ark god says the same thing but he leaves this off because after that he says you need you'll be eating meat in other words you won't have you won't subdue the earth anymore right now god tells them tells noah be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth why they had to there was only eight of them in the whole earth that's right but he did not say to subdue it because they can't you can't subdue this kingdom until brother brown tells us until we get into the millennium that's when you and i will be in glorified bodies and we'll be able to move trees mountains animals remember the bible says the lion will lay down with the lamb the bear will be gentle right but now they're scared of us and if you make them really mad they'll eat you that's the chain of evolution there's an eating chain it's an eating order be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it so he's telling this whatever this is which is a spirit man that they're going to subdue the earth and have dominion over the fish of the sea and follow the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth everybody good with that say amen stay with me here stay with me come on surely you didn't eat that much for lunch okay so now look so now we're going to go in just a minute and we're going to go to genesis 2 7. so remember this is genesis 1 26 this is not genesis 2 7. not a different man but a different position has everybody got that all right now watch genesis 5 verse 1 through 2 this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man in the likeness of god may he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam anybody got that name was not eve because she was an extension of adam the bible says she was woman which woman is what womb man with a womb woman man with a womb but he called their name adam in the day that were they were created now there had to be something happen when adam then calls her eve because god's already called him adam everybody got that god's already called them their name is adam not eve adam names her eve after the fall happens all right now luke 3 verse 37 i want you to look it at this this is the lineage i want you also remember look at this lineage now remember every seed has to bring forth of its kind and if i'm the seed of samuel dale and josh is the seed of samuel wadedale the second and deanna's the seat you understand what i'm saying then we then when we write our lineage or our lineage tree all those names will be in there is that right listen i'm gonna holler i don't care y'all wake up or go sleep if you want to i don't care i'm telling you i'm gonna keep preaching until somebody stays awake you ain't the only one but now this is the lineage of adam there's a key here this is the lineage of adam right look who's not in that lineage find me kane in this lineage cain his name is not in this lineage this is in the bible this is luke 3 verse 37 it lists you every person from jesus christ all the way down to adam i believe it is or abraham all the way down jared malalio kanan enos seth which was the son of adam where's cain now the bible didn't leave it out it would have been in there if cain would have been the son of adam that's right amen because every seed has to bring forth of its kind but which was the son of adam which was the son of god adam was the son of god in the old testament amen adam was the first son of god but remember he sold us out nobody got that say amen all right because remember we're going to read the scripture here in just a few minutes that where eve was deceived abe adam was not deceived he knew exactly what he was doing all right so let's go to the cruelty of sin let's read this quote from brother branham and then we'll read a couple quotes because what now we're doing is is when god first made man he was a spirit man that genesis 1 26 man was not a flesh man oh boy i'm going 10 more minutes y'all sleep again you don't believe me i got about six more pages i could we'll just yeah you just just thank you but if that shield was like um sunglasses i wouldn't know if he's asleep or not so then when god made his first man he was the spirit man so that genesis 1 26 man to control the world to control the earth that was a spirit man now you say oh was he fl no he was made in god's image and god is not like casper the friendly ghost because if we were made in his image according to genesis 1 26 he must be a man and he ain't a woman sorry i don't want no woman god that's what got us in trouble to start with so then when god made his first man he was a spirit man he was something on the order of god or the son of god the logos that was the first man i want y'all to understand something you're not getting this i don't think we're not different from the creator that genesis 1 26 man did to create him exactly because he said it was the logos the word the speech what came out of god was that first man he said oh no that was you oh right then he gave the man jurisdiction to lead the animal life just like the holy spirit leads the believer today go here do this now if we were perfect in submission to the holy spirit you see what i'm talking about if we go back before the fall there's complete submission to the holy spirit brother brown said there was a holy spirit veil over adam and eve listen they walked through the garden naked for years never thought a thing about it never had a carnal per a carnal thought in their mind why because the holy spirit was on them to veil them and i believe that holy spirit veil is going to be put back on because he's put it inside of us to not lust like we used to don't tell me it was eating apples come on people our biggest problem is lust goodness gracious god would lead us by the holy spirit just like adam led the animals of that day does everybody got that say amen all right here we go number let's read this pill of fire i think i stuck this one in here i didn't put any red on but look what this i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i believe that in the beginning god made man in his own image and god is a spirit and god made man spirit man then he made him in the dust of the earth that's what we're going to read because remember he took the genesis 1 26 man and put it in the 2-7 man that's right amen not two creations he just put in morphine yes this logos this you say logos didn't didn't didn't didn't i say the logos was the word the word the sp the speech so where did that logos go it went into adam because immediately adam started naming all the animals and god didn't go no adam i didn't no he every time adam named an animal god said son that's exactly what i was thinking that's how much in tune god and adam were before the fall then he made him in the dust of the earth now i believe that man in the beginning well led the animals of the earth like the holy spirit ought to leave leave leading the church today there was no man to till the soil i want you to see this right here so then he put him in five senses what are our five senses see taste feel smell and hear and they every one can be deceiving and can be deceived see taste feel smelling here go to a magic show sometime amen you get deception everywhere in those five senses them five senses was not to contact god that was see taste filled smelling here they were to contact his earthly home but by his spirit he contacted god by his spirit he contacts god hmm how about that i like that but by he puts the two together the five senses does not contact god it's a way for me and you to contact each other it's a way for me and you to live on this earth by sea tastes feel smelling here but now satan knew that and satan moved right through that into that second realm of memory reasoning conscious affection and imagination and that's where his playground is still today all right now look let's start with this genesis 2 7. all right everybody okay we're in the bible now and the lord god formed a man of the dust of the ground and look breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul may i say man became adam there was only one guy adam but now remember he had the male part and the female part inside of him because of the genesis 1 26 man because where did god get that he took the rib he took the feminist spirit off of adam and put it on eve that's why watch how it's perverted today what satan done he took that feminist spirit and put it back on the men he's took that man spirit and put it on the woman he's a spiritual being he can manipulate see god said it right the first time yes satan is the one that's got it twisted for all these other perversions and everything because remember he can't bring life but he can pervert it all right so man became a living soul so there stood adam god formed of the dust of the ground so he took the ground while you and i are what sixteen elements of the earth potash calcium and all the different things all right and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man who it formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the site and good for food there's that what's that thing over there called a semicolon because he didn't plant these two trees see that semicolon over there god is telling us now let's back up for a minute for those of you that are new who wrote the first five books of the bible moses moses was not in the garden he was old but he wasn't that old but he wasn't he had to go back by by vision or by revelation moses had to god had to project moses back into the garden of eden to write this right here remember the torah the first five books or even four books if you want to say the first four books were written by moses so he god had to project him into the garden of eden but he projected him in the garden of eden to write it in a mystery so that only the true genesis 1 26 people will understand really what happened because everything else is fairy tales santa claus easter trinity yeah all right they're fairy tales all right concocted not by god but by the devil he just perverted the word just like i'm telling you now there was a a man standing in the garden that had a feminist side to him and a masculine side and god separated the feminist side took a rib out made her a body and put that spirit in there and called her woman we'll look at it in a minute but out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant in the sign good for food semicolon he's not he's bringing a thought but he's not stopping that one and he's not continuing that thought so much that he never said he planted these trees the tree of life you can't plant a tree of life oh yeah there's a natural tree of life everybody seen it it's like over in africa or somewhere and it keeps growing out and growing there's a june's got some pictures of it or you can buy it on a little pendant it's called the tree of life that's not that tree of life the tree of life also in the midst of the garden he put it right in the middle of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now what kind of tree would that look like what kind of fruit you're gonna get on that all right so we'll get somewhere in just a second everybody all right say amen still got one or two asleep so i'm continuing on and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress it in to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat now remember he's not in the written word but where's lucifer he's standing right there he ain't off on a party somewhere remember because he got whipped in heaven hallelujah he got whipped in heaven and he's on the earth didn't i just read you the scripture the fight was before the foundation of the world so satan satan can't go back to heaven so he's going he's going to be standing right there the lord god commanded the man luis you're adam i'm the man i'm commanding you of every tree of the garden that i may freely eat cause you know what you might get a little bit hungry every once in a while and you may want something to eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it and there he stood right there because the tree of knowledge of good and evil is not a tree it was lucifer because your two trees standing in the garden was the man that's talking to adam and lucifer that's your two trees in the garden listen that's not too little trees we know that there is no tree that you can get knowledge of good and evil off of you want me to prove that let me read you real quick brother louise pull i mean brother anderson pull that up that i told you we wouldn't need for a little while watch this mark 8 verse 24 and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking moses is using an allegory or a simulation because it's not trees but he said i see men as trees what men right standing upright so what was the tree of life it was jesus christ what was the tree of knowledge of good and evil lucifer amen and which one you eat off of today you are eating off of one of those two trees right now spiritually speaking all right cut that out but we'll need that in just a minute but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt i like that black background that's pretty neat thou shalt not eat of for in the day that thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die remember that right right right and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone you know why because god said i was alone at one time i need adam to talk to but adam needs somebody to talk to him adam needs somebody to fulfill the genesis 126 of multiplication even though we spiritually multiply you still need a male and a female you still need jesus christ and his bride amen and the lord said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help me now remember that not that's not helped mate i looked that word up again that word meat means equal i helped mate like brother dale said i helped mate you you can two men can make but it's not right but but you can't be a help meat that's what that word meat means m-e-e-t it is a helper co-equal with the person that was created because remember before the fall adam and eve were one they were right here just like this right there was none of this you had the ruler over this one and you had to the ruler over that one no eve was what eve was adam made manifest in another form she was a man with a womb out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name there of in other words god said it's good because you know what god knew that that big gray thing that had a trunk sticking out weighed 10 or 15 tons he knew that was an elephant and adam said oh we'll name that elephant amen and god gave names adam gave names to all cattle wait a minute am i done there oh i'm sorry to see what they called him and that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all the cattle fell in the air every beast said why does that keep coming up beast beast of the field but for adam there was not found and helped me for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam here's your first surgery in the bible and he slept and he took one of the ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto adam and adam said adam said this is now bone of my fa by listen literally she literally had the same dna he had but she was just in the woman form and him being in the man form all right everybody got that this is now bone of my bone flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman what man with a womb woe man woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed wow what a strange thing right can't happen now but remember what we're fixing to talk about remember you can take a two-year-old child boy and a girl put them in a bathtub they'll play with the toys they can be naked as the day that is born they'll play with toys they ain't worrying about that other stuff now wait till they're 15 don't put them two back in the same bathtub again now where did that come from that come from right here that come from the mind that come from the mind the carnal mind is enmity to gods everybody got that say amen because we're going to get into something right here in genesis 3 verse 1. now look here's the great mystery it's not a mystery to most of us now the serpent was more subtle than any beast now literally a serpent is not a beast but he named it that here's now look here's moses here i go again you got to go back into the mind of god and let let god show you what moses was doing moses was sitting somewhere writing this down and he was watching a vision right yeah amen first television vision he was watching this vision right now the serpent was more subtle subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made so there is a beast now come into the picture everybody got that and he said unto the woman listen monkey can't talk that's right right chimpanzee can't talk orangutan can't talk spider-monkey can't talk this thing started talking amen and he said unto the woman yeah god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden now we don't know about time and we don't know what went on but that beast had to be around adam and eve for a long time because he could communicate with him he was the communication between adam the beast and the other animals everybody got that it's just simple because he's talking now but what did satan do satan stood right there and he watched that and he couldn't create an animal but he sure can anoint an animal so he anointed this beast now who is this talking this is not the beast talking you say well how do you know that well you know what why does the bible start with a beast in the beginning with us so much trouble and why does he end up in the book of revelations with a beast that has power that is talking amen they're all right well why'd he start with a beast and and then now he's called the beast in the very end that's going to what deceive the whole world he didn't have to deceive but one woman in the beginning but he deceived the whole world over here in the end amen you see how that beast is yes because remember whoever this whatever this animal is it was turned into a snake it didn't start a snake it was turned into a snake amen you shall not eat of every tree of this garden and the woman said unto the serpent first thing she should have said was let me go get my husband she got out from under headship that was her first problem right there cause remember satan is not one he's not playing with her body there's a veil there but he's playing in her mind that's where the first seed got planted right here and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden now remember she didn't say anything about tree of life she's talking about tree of knowledge of good and evil of the tree of the which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it touch it why would you not want to touch a tree if this is a literal tree that's right why'd god say don't touch that bark yeah it's kind of silly in it that people think it was a little tree and the serpent said of the woman ye shall surely die nope he didn't say that he said ye shall not surely die that's right there's the fall right there because that planted a seed in eve's mind that she can get by or she's going to fulfill god's promise through this beast not that one word right there god said you eat there you shall surely die just in genesis 2 verse 17. and here we go in genesis 3 verse 4 he's already adding to the word lucifer through the beast is talking you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day god sees god god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes will be open and you shall be as god she should have stopped him right there and said hey i am a god she was already a god she had dominion over the fish of the sea and foul the air and all the different things she you see how he blinded her eye right knowing good and evil they knew good but they didn't know evil and when the woman saw not touched at that moment saw that the tree was good for food and wait a minute it was pleasant to the eyes now i like this little cornucopia thing they do in october and i like that beautiful fruit but i ain't never seen a fruit that was present pleasant she says it was pleasant to the eye roll it up so everybody can see it and a tree to be desired to make one wise what kind of tree is this she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also and to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked now why did a piece of fruit until adam and eve they were naked no and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they put them where they needed to be not in their hands and their mouth now let me tell you how this works how this is all put together god puts little keys in the bible now brother anderson pull that back up now look she thought hold on hold on go back how about what now took of the fruit we're talking about fruit right we're talking about fruit fruit fruit fruit fruit fruit we're talking about fruit right and everybody's got apples and oranges in their mind now watch this let's go to genesis 30 verse 2. the one that you pulled up that you miraculous thank you and jacob's anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in god's stead who has be withheld from thee the fruit of the womb psalms 127 verse 3 low children are a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward what are you you are the fruit that was born in your mother womb in your mother's womb so don't tell me this is talking about a tree that's regular fruit no god gives us all these pointers there are several places in the bible talks about the fruit of the womb because you are that what is that that's a that's a sexual thing that's that's how you procreate you are the fruit of the womb but listen you and i were not supposed to come the way that she's fixing to do you and i were supposed to come what up here spoken word seed children because this is the biggest womb [Music] right here this is your problem right here because it emanates from here to where she's fixing to do the act with the beast let's go back now let's go back to the to genesis so there's talk about this then it's not always talking about fruit fruit fruit fruit so now go up to genesis first timothy 2 verse 12. if this is now remember adam and eve were equal everything was fine everything was dandy she and him were co-equal but now after the fall but i suffered not a woman to teach nor herself authority over a man but to be in silence that's why we don't believe in women preachers we don't it's not that we don't believe in women preachers the bible tells us we shouldn't have women preacher for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression because remember in genesis 3 now let's go back to genesis 3 15 where genesis 3 7 to where we were at just just scroll it down there you go hold on go back up that way whoa and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food it was pleasant to the eyes now what's satan doing satan through the beast is telling her say look god told you to procreate god told you to multiply look at the animals look at the birds look at the other things that's going on he said what's your problem see he's going natural with it what's your problem what's your problem what you're a little slow there eve but i can help you out because see i can being the beast i can coincide with you i can in other words i can have relations with you and we can have this multiply and replenish the earth thing that god's telling us about see how slick he is it wasn't he was so far off the word he was just he was just horrible which it was the most horrible thing that ever happened but eve received it in the womb of her mind first then the natural act happened because remember cain is not in the lineage of adam why is cain not in the lineage of adam and she came through and he came through eve he's never in the lineage right then you go way over in the bible it tells you that enoch was the seventh from adam will you count from enoch seven seven generations cain's not in there it never mentions cain cain is of that wicked one cain come from what the beast there is your mystery because god then actually what did god do god said okay man's not gonna be able to find you anymore this horrible thing that you've done and we'll stop right here we'll get to that later on because in genesis 3 what happens then god comes down and says adam where are you because before then adam and eve could walk right up to the creator and talk to him just like me and brother callie with no shame no fear because there was no fear when you when you have only good there's no fear the fear is when you have evil right because that's what we fear now we fear the evil we don't fear the good that god does to us we feel the evil that the devil's trying to do to us but then god comes to the garden of eden and he's not adam's not running after i'm not guess what we did no he was ashamed of what he did it was so shameful he didn't want to meet god so they go running back in the garden of eden and behind the trees and god has to go looking for adam just like he went looking for me and you just like you went looking for me and you you weren't looking for god because you were a sorry bunch of flesh all of us were but god came looking for me boys i like that song he came looking for me when i was down and low he came looking for me so listen hold on a minute god didn't walk into the garden brother doherty and say i really don't know what went on i'm trying to find adam he knew exactly what was going to happen he knew exactly what had happened he was looking for his son he was looking for his daughter he was looking to save them they were trying to save their self by sowing that fig leaf apron up to what to cover their self but god comes walking up and we'll get to it next week in other words god's standing there he said i know i knew what you'd do so before the foundation of the world in my mind i went to calvary and now what said in the book of revelation says revelation somewhere in there it says that that all will be deceived if they don't have their name written in the lamb's book of life slain before the foundation of the world and actually literally god almighty himself made a sacrifice amen he killed two lambs bible tells us we'll read it next sunday he takes two lambs rips the skin off of them throws them into the bushes and says put that on because you're going to need a blood covering you're not going to need you know what the word religion means the word religion literally means covering they were making their own religion they were trying to cover up what they had done but god knew what they'd do he took killed those two lambs throw them back in the bushes here put this on and then we see several months later on we see two twins born it's all yeah cain and abel were born from the beast and adam and that started a line now remember that was a natural line because remember cain could have stopped the spiritual part when god told him said if you'll do as your brother abel in other words i'll forgive you and if you'll go do a lamb sacrifice but he said no why because he was like he had what the characteristics of that seed that brought forth of his kind which was an animal which was a beast that's why cain is of that wicked one he slew abel in type that christ would come through seth being resurrected back up right because i'm gonna read i'll read it to you next sunday there's like two times in the bible that shows the genealogy of adam and cain is nowhere exactly to be found because it wasn't remember remember eve the bible says is the mother of all living that's the truth amen but adam was not the father of all living there was a beast got interjected interjected in there and god so took that thing and made it a snake afterwards to where you can't find the skeleton the beast anymore you can't find anything oh sure you can find them that look like cane because even the bible tells you that there were giants in the land big people big creatures listen cain didn't look a bit like abel because they had different daddies that's why cain slew abel cain didn't have a daddy to lead and guide him and he wouldn't take correction just like lucifer did in the beginning let's stand our feet the two spirits are now come from a spiritual lineage which is lucifer and his angels and god and his angels and god is walking literally in the garden of eden there's his son and daughter they have fallen they have done something they were told not to do but remember god was so gracious listen to me god was so gracious he didn't destroy adam and he didn't destroy eve he didn't even curse adam the only thing he'd done to eve is sisters you know what i'm talking about you're going to have sorrow and childbearing you're going to have your 30-day cycle you're going to be weak you're going to be the weaker vessel man is going to be over you man is going to be your head ship from now on because you are the one that got deceived by an animal but now remember the first adam musicians come on the first adam knew what he was doing he could not kill eve and start over because she was literally him the second adam came on earth he wasn't deceived either but he was getting ready to do as brother dale's talking about he's getting ready to build his body back he's getting ready to put it back in an eating condition he's getting ready now right now he's building that body back in an even condition where had there not been a fall adam and eve would have been there now whatever you want to say doesn't matter to me but it had it was never sex to be multiplication that genesis 1 26 man was supposed to multiply just like right now when the word goes forth that's a seed that's a spoken word and you all every one of you that's born again today came from a spoken word seed doesn't matter doesn't matter what your background of your natural seed was that came because of the fall doesn't matter if your mama was a and your daddy was a drunk that's right god don't look at that if you'll turn to him you'll turn to him you know what he's saying he says look i can't help you in that condition because every seed's got to bring forth of its kind see satan knew that that's why he could get over there in the beast and say okay god you now gonna have to fulfill your word because i'm fixing to enter this beast and i'm going to make this beast have a relations with your daughter eve and i'm going to defile the whole thing and god couldn't stop it because he put eve on free moral agency and he said every seed had to bring forth of its kind so the seed that she was that she was given was a beast seed that's why that we see genesis 3 15. you don't believe that genesis 3 15 tells us we'll read it next sunday he said i'll put enmity or division between thy seed and the seed of the woman now who was the seed of the woman see the woman's not a woman see the woman's christ because a woman don't have a seed she had to the seed had to be planted in the womb of mary but remember mary's womb was not the first place that god came to remember he sent gabriel to talk to mary and mary had to accept it here first this is the first womb right here she accepted in this woman and all of a sudden what was fulfilled isaiah 9 6 says the virgin shall conceive see satan satan's going ah god you got to do everything you said you got to do everything you said and god's over going yeah i know i know i got all that set up devil i i don't know where you think i came from but i wasn't even born i've been here way before you was and i've got this all fixed when i said every seed to bring forth of its kind guess what god germ god egg put in a woman beginning of the creation of god genesis i mean revelations 3 14 what brother dale's been preaching on where the bible says the beginning of the creation of god and you and i being the continuation of that because jesus christ the son of man said he come forth to do what soul seed and what is seed the word he sowed the word down into paul i mean peter james john all the different ones it was on the day of pentecost and god didn't have to come down through an act like happened in the garden no he came down from a spiritual act got to the womb of their mind and said if you'll let me in that womb i'll give you something that man cannot give you i'll give you eternal life i don't care what your mama was i don't care what your daddy was i don't care if you don't even know who your mom and daddy is when you get born again you'll know who your mama and daddy is your mama's a word of god and the heavenly father is your daddy and what does he do he comes down and fertilizes that womb in your mind and gives you spiritual revelation but trust me the world is deceived about what went on in the garden there's no way that it was an apple or anything like that listen it's like daddy said many times before just sit down somewhere in a dark room and close your eyes and realize what your problem is right you'll know it wasn't you ate an apple amen the carnal mind the bible says is an enmity with god that's our division is right here that's why jesus didn't have a carnal mind he didn't have an earthly mother or father oh now mary was mary wasn't his mother she didn't produce anything zero she didn't produce an egg if she had produced an egg it would have been a body that would have had a natural lineage amen no no no spiritual lineage so god created the egg god created the germ put them together in the womb of mary and she just says be it unto me according to thy word can we say that today let's sing a song god bless you touching jesus [Music] yeah we got a lot of natural trouble try jesus [Music] [Music] of god oh touching jesus is all that really matters and your life would never be the same [Music] and there's only one way [Music] one more time let's worship it for a minute jesus is all that really matters [Music] and your life will never be [Music] [Applause] one way [Music] you know i was thinking the other day the world calls the name of jesus a lot but they blaspheme most of the time why in the world would you want to call that precious name and and use it as a slang word but the world does it all the time why would you take the most perfect name the salvation of the world comes through that name there's no other name whereby men can be saved yes they turn why because satan has perverted it he's twisted it just a little bit that's the same way i'm telling you now we talked about the two spirits when when when eve and the beast were right there so close together those two spirits were right there and they were talking to each other and you see what happened because in eve what eve had the emotion eve you know sisters you all are more emotional than men um and satan knew that he had a way to get to you and that was through eve's emotion that's why that now that that we look at emotions good but you know what lucifer was full of emotion he was the anointed cherub he was an anointed angel he was the song leader he was the one that got everything going and and probably led the choir in heaven until he figured out he didn't want to do that anymore he wanted something a lot better so he comes down here and he sees a pure adam and eve standing in the garden and what a deceiver what a what a awful thing because that was so beautiful think about it joy peace nothing going wrong no sickness no heartaches no trouble you'd think but see we're dealing with the devil [Music] he says i'm gonna go down there in that perfect garden everything's all in order adam can just speak and the wind stops eve can just speak and the animals move out of the way but i'm gonna go down there because i found a weak vessel and i'm going to mar that image you know what satan was saying i'm gonna create me an eden and this is what he gets right here this is satan's eden that we're living in right now but the most deceiving part is though is that one word not quoted everything he could quote except not so we must take this word of god brother brown said he said one word got him out he said one word wrong got him out one word wrong won't get us back in so that's why we strive and we try to live so close to the bible and so close to what the holy spirit tells us to do even more than the world that's why sometimes the world thinks they know we're strange they just meet us a little while and they know that we were different i hope so i hope they do know that we're different that they can see our different walk and different actions why because we come from a spoken word seed of god that cannot fall will not fall and never fail genesis 1 26 man never fell they fell in their spirit realm and their their body just reacted to what was going on everybody got that adam and eve had eternal life in their soul just like you have eternal life in your soul but god said that's all right devil he said because i got a desire i want to save them people you want to kill them and you want to put them in your eden he said but i want to save them and take them right back into the garden of eden that's what he said in christ the mystery of god reveal what take us back to the garden of eden as if there had not been a fall god had to allow your body to come here through whatever desire from your parents but you had to match that image that god saw before the foundation of the world and when you match that image we're going to take it right out of here because when our body gets changed folks we're not going to change back into a different one this body at 20 years old is just going to move right back into that because that's the part that god saw [Music] before all this chaos happened i love that folks he preserved that part of him that satan listen satan can be religious satan can have an anointing satan can quote the word word for word all but one word but he can't ever be that one part he can't ever be that part of that genesis 1 26 cannot can't touch it and if you got it in your soul today he can't touch you so you pray for revelation because we need revelation more than anything in this world is what the bible said it's what we're trying to do and we're going to try to live this as close as we can thank god that we know where we came from we know what we're doing here and we know where we're going to me that's an assurity that's not a hope i don't hope i'm safe i don't hope there's a heaven for us to go to i don't hope there's this i know for a fact a fact that we're going somewhere that satan can't go sister satan can't go with us he can't make your legs hurt that bad where we're going but lord i pray that he'll give you a little touch of it right now any of us that are sick i hope he gives you a little touch brother branham said that was a what a mini resurrection when you get healed it's a mini resurrection but we're not going to be like lazarus folks we're not going to die again we're going up we're getting out of here but we got to get this right first find out where those two spirits are and discern to stay away from one and that's the bad one discern it stay away from it you love the lord let's bow our hands to heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us we pray that you would sanctify us lord for our journey we know that one thing's for sure that as soon as we walk out the door the devil's going to be right there but we know that greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world there is nothing that satan can do to my soul lord after you sealed it in by the baptism of the holy ghost let's hope that every i pray that everyone realizes that lord he can play with all emotions he can play with our uh corporal bodies all he wants to but lord down inside let me say as horatio spafford said it is well with my soul it is well it is well with my soul because in his humanity he was hurting he was lonely probably had many nights he cried himself to sleep [Music] but he knew that anchor was inside and that anchor held and did he'd see his kids again he'd see all of his loved ones and he wrote that song it is well it is well with my soul be with us lord take care of us we come back together wednesday night bless brother chris as he travels down here lord give him supernatural strength today lord speaking at brother jewels today we pray that you be with brother jewel lord strengthen him give him supernatural strength lord in his body and all the different ones lord that need prayer we pray that you'd touch each one thank you for touching sister audrey lord in helping her through this father we know you are the healer the doctors can do whatever they can do but lord you heal our bodies you died at calvary and you took those stripes and we claim those bloodstained stripes lord for all of our healing in the name of jesus christ amen call on his name you're dismissed oh touching jesus and your life will never be the same there's only one way sure just [Music] [Applause] [Music]
