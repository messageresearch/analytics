to turn in your scriptures turn to Joel - and then go we'll go to Hosea 6 John to Hosea 6 good to see everybody here this morning we want to make sure and thank brother Bob and brother Louise for taking over the services while we were gone away for hunting a few days and had a good time didn't do much good with the killing time but we had a good time fellowship inion you know all the little rest time out of it and that was good so we thank God for that all right now remember for this coming Tuesday now not ever Tuesday from now on thereby got it this coming Tuesday which will set in motion for us for we will have services on Tuesday of this week not Wednesday because of your Thanksgiving time okay everybody with me so that for their services and we'll start it from now on tour in the month of November when we have the Thanksgiving that will have the Tuesday night service instead of a Wednesday night service okay so everybody's got that now see a lot of people who say well I didn't hear you say that I heard you say we're gonna change the service institute I didn't say that I said we're gonna change it for one month out of the year to order that we can have the services and that way you could be with your families and all on the Thanksgiving the time okay so we got that part no all right let's see - Wade will be ministering the Lord willing on that day okay I've got something to say to you I put a sign on the door downs tires going down the door that goes out you know and and I've been coming in a lot of times you know we don't go down and check that door but I'd find it open you know or unlock the door without going down and turn and go down the bottom okay everybody got it and I made a note and put it up there please do not unlock this door well you know what come in today and it's unlocked so now somebody can't read or really there can't obey instructions see somebody went out that door left the door unlocked okay if they want to break in then they're gonna get what they want and don't have to tear down the doors we put locks on the doors to try to keep out these when you put a sign on the outside the door said this door was left open you know don't do that all right so please there's no need of going out that door there's no reason it's only a safety purposes when you going down the stairway we turn left go out if you turn right you just going down into the bottom and going out that's only for safety purposes you know not for you to go in and out you know we would we don't want to nail it too because it wouldn't be no purpose for the door all right so if you would make sure don't go down that away we'll probably wind up and put one of those crime sticker tapes but I know people they'll raise that up walk right under it and go do what you want to do right but just remember now don't be doing that because you know if you get in if they get in here they can get what you want - like that okay so we've got that taken care of and all of the things alright just pray one for another let's go right on into our scriptures and do it as any other announcements Terrance has made the other announcement the children are going to practice this afternoon okay after the eating the children gonna practice okay we're going to start a thing who were that the children you know and they don't have this fully set which week or what all right we had discussed moving the evening service to try to help but that won't help because it's gonna put us later in the day all right so we're not going to do it that away but what we're going to do is somebody will have to set a schedule and get it to where they can have rotate the children as to practicing after the evening service now I still if you want to come in practice between the services all right you with me if you want to come in special things do whatever between the services just do by the order that we've tried to go by is get through by 1:30 where we can you know not be in interfering with the evening service all right so we're not doing it away with the practice between the services everybody got it but they're setting it for the children to practice for them to how after the evening service and they can rotate that like and have one one week one next week whatever they want to do to try to practice more because we need more practice I understand that but we don't have the facilities the abilities and the things and we don't want to move the evening service because especially in this short period of time of the evening you know those now it's little after 5:00 it's getting dark so we don't want to do that and move you up 30 minutes just to do that so but the children now do you understand me the adults who handle the singing of the things set up your schedule get everything going get with the musicians connect it all together to where that you can have that you know after the evening service cuz listen you're outside for our right you're outside for an hour after the evening service talking well when the evening service ends here you can just children just come right on up and everything schedule and you practice for a little while uh-huh it's not adding no time to nobody because you're gonna be out there anyway it's just consuming or you know what do you call that redeeming the time to where we can do it okay but just think of those things now there's services I mean the times of the practice and the thing father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for your love we thank you for every time we just ask you now that you'd give us a vial of and that understanding and how to present Lord want you to have for each one of us we need you so much and we thank you just have your way just open our understanding to thy word and let your hearts and your love be with each one of us guide us forgive our sins and keep us that's your grace be sufficient we believe you and we thank you in Jesus name very for me your scripture with us but I'm wondering if we understand it so that's why I want to take an opportunity if not will if we don't finish you today we will try to get it you know a little later Joel - beginning about verse 22 be not afraid you beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness to spring for the three bars her fruit in her fig the fig tree and deveined do yield her strength be glad then you children of Zion and resource choice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former rain moderately and will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month now what that is totally there is no planting ability to plant and redeem within a month so get the point don't start from where we've done no it's an expression or a thought to coming forth as to what is to take place because this is what's to take place the floor shall be full of wheat and the fad shall overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer were my great army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward now watch this afterward when we get into Hosea okay and it shall come to pass afterward that I pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days but I pour out my spirit can't go to Hosea 6 come and let us return unto the Lord for he has torn and he and he will heal he had smitten and he will bind us up remember take a warm pond warm locals caterpillar eating down it comes back what's it now after two days will he revive us after two days in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then see when that happens here you know if you follow on to know the Lord is going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word pray for my throat this morning I've had sinus problems or whatever in this it's got a gov Aten but no listen that's what I say it we read the Bible you know you know we don't pay close attention to what it's saying a lot of times we get our idea our concept or thought see and we say well we got it you know we know that well that may be true if it is true but it may not be true it may be that we are making the Bible say something that it doesn't say all right then mankind can read it and say well look at all of the contradictions that are in the Bible well I've always said it you know if you can find one to come and tell me now don't come and tell me something little silly thing come and tell me so I'll show me a contradiction in the word and I'll be glad to discuss it with you not whether they one blind man or two blind men or you know because you got differences in the writings all right now but what I want you to think about is it's probably about six times five times I know at least in the Bible that it speaks of the former and latter rain alright and there's where the reason I chose to read this one is work says within the first month well we start off immediately saying we do not understand them the way it states it so it must be stating it for some reason for it to be within one month there's no such thing as any way to plant any food and one month later you gather it so then immediately we know that it's not saying what we think well it's just from planting rain and it and the gathering right you know it's just it's just that's the former and latter rain but remember this before we get into the message at all remember this point the rain is the same is this the position that it's occurring in it's like we've just finished the series on the statue of a perfect man and talking about cornerstone and headstone it's the same stone but it's the position that the stone is in is what you're dealing with not the fact of trying to make it two different stones or something you know it's not that away so don't try to make it two different rains make it what it is it's the form of rain and then a lot of rain all right as I said then - don't try to narrow your mind to the thoughts because even over in James it says the husbandmen which is Almighty God is waiting himself patiently for the former and latter rain now would God be waiting for the former and latter rain or is that a statement that he's waiting for a time to produce the rain it's not the basis of whether he's waiting for it to come you know it's the basis that he has set a time frame or whatever and he's saying well it won't come till this time this time I'll wait patiently I would like to finish it up you know I'd like to cut the scripture would say the work short you know I'd like to do that but I won't I make my promise and I'll keep my promised and I'll bring it to Pais when when I'm bringing it to PI's it's not dealing with him waiting himself it's him waiting for a time to make that manifest in you and I so get that thought in your mind of this about the former and latter rain alright now we take the natural story of the former and latter rain to connect it together to bring it to the spiritual okay now the word more art teaching rain the is what you're dealing with but let me state this before we start we're not dealing with the seed you know or thoughts they so get that settled in your mind alright because the rain has nothing to do with the seed if you don't put the seed in the ground the rain does no good the rain is too quickly or make alive what you plant all right so former rain or you would be around the world all those difference in all kind of seeds and plantings and things but the main point is for one thing that there's a planting time and a harvest time all right so in the natural you have as you go out and you get your ground ready you get your your tight and you you put your seed in the ground and if you're in an area that does not have enough moisture to be able to quicken that seed you pour a little water with it or maybe like cabbage onions or something like that you dig a hole all right that's the way we are here basically see and you dig a hole and you don't just stick that cabbage plant or onion or tomato plant whatever you don't just stick it down in dry ground it's going to die all right so what do you do you pour some water on it but you don't pour gallons of water you only pour enough water for it to be able to start its growth because if not you're going to drink drowned out the plant and kill the plant or artist the things I've even done it and I know you have I've known that it was pretty dry and I've taken and put my seed in the ground and and then sprinkle a little water over it you know I mean I don't flood the whole garden I don't put four or five inches I just put a little bit enough to germinate that seed but now here's the point what does it matter about the rain former or latter and you'll see that as we continue to thought that what does it matter about the rain if you have no seed for it to follow them right and see remember this about the former and latter right remember what we read then we got to promise in the scripture that he would pour out of his spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy here you know you know all the things it's poured out on everything when it when it rains or even if you dig a hole and you pour water there you know yourself that you dig it out you put a tomato plant well you go back out turn about a week later and you tomato plants just setting up you know it's not doing do good because it you know it's it's getting this connection to the ground but you look around it and here's all these little morning glories growing up all around it you got to clean them out alright see the natural point of what you're talking about the rain that falls on the just and the unjust according to all right these in whatever rain it is remember it's for all seeds to come to growth it's for them to grow up it's for them to become mature it's for them to reproduce themselves right okay so you don't just get you don't plant a vine and then you get one tomato that wouldn't be too profitable you wouldn't be sensible to sow your corn and you put out one grain of corn and you get one grain of corn back that's not too sensible you want it back in a multiple form to word that you can have something to eat but get this point now as we go along the rain that falls the scripture says about it it falls on the just and the unjust all right it's the same rain we've heard the Prophet tell the story over and over of how that that as its own the seed is sown upon the ground and and it comes forth but also here comes the weeds I didn't plant them did you ever planted any weeds you ever tried to transplant weed don't worry about it they're gonna be that just leave the ground alone they're gonna be there plenty of weeds gonna grow you don't have to plant them but somebody else does all right so that's what's happening now get this as we get to the point if we don't finish it today we'll finish this then later see think we talked about latter rain and we think about latter rain oh that's where people don't understand this what they'll say people don't understand ladder rain is only for the bride now where did you get that idea you certainly didn't get it out of the Bible you certainly never got it out of the prophets message because he said latter rain he said the latter rain will sweep the world that's why I've always told it I've always believed it I always look forward to it a revival but just remember how deceiving that revival is going to be because that harvest time is going to be for all kind see that's the point that we don't look at it I've always taught you to always believe the same rain our spirit our quickening that's quickening to you the truth of God's Word it does not quicken the lie no no it won't quicken a lot I don't get me wrong there so leave that out it won't quicken a lie it won't quicken the false line but that's the deception of where it's at it's the same rain that will fall on just and unjust and brings them to their crop right and finishes that part of the reproducing of itself coach I mean I'd like to say the more menu this quarter and cut that Oh morning glory or whatever down how do you garden and you said man I'm through with that on that round no problem with that one no no what about a week later you're gonna have another one growing right beside of it there's nothing else use your will the next year yeah but I cut that one down don't worry about it it'll be there all right what are you following my point now when we talk about former rain in the latter rain what do you think about all right you said what I think about the quickening of the word all right you're in the right position the right point but just remember the same rain that quickens our truth to you well also quicken gonna remember Satan cannot do it there's your deception there's your closeness is you got to get Satan has no ability to give life so let's get this thing straight before we even start through the message no matter how long it takes I'm pretty good at that anyway just I didn't have what about 40 messages for the life service but all right what does it mean former rain and ladder right and remember the point is I'm getting no matter what it is it's the same rain the same rain that falls on your garden your beans potatoes tomatoes whatever you planted is the same rain that falls on the weeds and makes those weeds grow and reproduce what I like about it is that sometimes we find out them weeds is pretty good you know maybe uh maybe some of you ain't never ate some things like we have in a creases and poke sallet sand and all kind of things that others look at you in life I remember Terence one time he didn't like it because he ate some pokes at it and we'd all would have it every year a couple of times a year you know I wouldn't now but you know we just don't do it but we always had that folks out of it and you know Darren said I ain't eating that no more because he got an instant problem out of it and he didn't want no more pokes at it all right well but that didn't stop me from eating it that was just his problem some of those things we think are not too good to eat it might be pretty good all right but remember they have their place right that's the point they have their place but now get the point before we enter what we're trying to say we talked about rain but remember it's former rain in Latin right now former rain we're gonna get to it in a minute and call it planting rain but remember it's the seed that shows the rain to be true you plant your garden you put that seed in the ground if the moisture does not come to that seed it will not sprout forth I don't care how what you paid for it or what you call it you know it won't work it takes the moisture and the moisture is the holy spirit all right and being the being that it's the rain we look at the rain as the most importance and that's alright that's fine but just remember the seed is what you're planning you're not planning rain right you're not going out there planting rain it'll come until we know that this it's the same rain all the way through see whatever you pour a little bit old that's water that comes from heaven and brings down and wherever it comes from but it still the same rain and a week or two later you don't have to pour it unknown it one because it'll naturally rain all right so we don't do as the foreign fields that I've a little bit of check tone to it but in some places they have what they call former rains or style you know points and then it stays dry for quite a while and then it becomes and and the latter rain comes and produces all right we don't do that here if we did we dry out and die you know what we do here you got to have the planting part you got to get to plant up then you got to have rain continually throughout the growth development of that seed into granite to maturity then you come to the basis that we call it well that's that probably the life's rain will get but we really need a good rain a lot of times we get a good gush of rain you know and it'll finally produce your product and you certainly don't need no monsoon season but now if you're raised in wheat you see what I'm getting that is it's so hard to try to describe to people because your mind is in one way thinking another if you're raising wheat you want a lot of rain you know and in these foreign countries they have to punt it up put the water in on the time and the it grows up through all right but now get the point of what I'm saying the main thing is what is the seed you plant we talk about the rain great no matter what the seed is coming home one day and my wife we had built a house there and Gil's woman she we had a flower bed thing made and kind of a slope off and and he was all dug up and planted and you know and she said I've got us some vines to grow up here on the side of this thing to come up in and go over and I said you did yeah I said well why'd you get I don't know it's kind of a purple looking kind of seed and that triggered a little bit you know I said do you keep any of them she said yeah that little pack well on the pack I picked it up I I grabbed the whole one started digging you know why she had bought kudzu uh-huh she had bought kudzu it would grow over the house in the house and through the house it would take over the house right no it isn't hard to kill kudzu but to say she was trying to do what she thought was right she just got the wrong seed all right now that's the point see whatever now this is something that's gonna be hard for you to comprehend for a minute and I want to be slowing continual talk you you take seed and you plant them they're going to bring forth what ever the seed is right and and that's in the whole world all right but just remember it's the same rain weeds don't get a different rain it's the same rain but you said well why would God do that why would he allow those things and then we read like we did in in jaw and he talks about the cankerworm pond worm locusts and Caterpillar he says my great army that I sent among you well did God send the cankerworm upon warm locusts the caterpillar no he permitted it he didn't send it it's not his army it's that he permitted these things to take place you cannot make God guilty of doing wrong all right so he permits these things what two tries you have there in the scripture about incentive or profit you assign and it come to pies you're supposed to hear that profit right we believe that that scripture all right but there's another scripture the city for profit give a sign and it come to pies and he takes you to another God said don't hear him you know the rest of that scripture says because I have sent this among you to try you know but God that's and that's bad for you to you to send these things among us he wants his children to grow up and not stay babies he wants us to the basis that we can stand the pressure the troubles and the things all right so then thereby keep the point in mind there's only one rain you called it former you call it ladder you're just distinguishing whatever it is for the time right okay you just you're just talking about whether it's the early rain or latter rain or whatever it's not the rain it's the seed is the importance but rental most forward original seed he said see what kind of seed has been sown you mean God would permit these things to take place oh he's not a good god when he no you thinking about a dhoti old granddaddy you ain't thinking about a god or even a father that wants his children to grow up I've told you about it I we stout pictures on the wall of all the kids through their lives and I'm looking at that one day and I thought we you know there's a place for Anna there's a place for waiting Terrance they kind of stand out in your eyes and you think well it'd be nice if they stayed that away but you know I thought no that wouldn't be right as they were not brought into the world to state twelve years of age they were brought into the world to grow up and become children and then children adults and then start to reproductive process over to bring it to were you to have grandchildren great-grandchildren etc etc that's the purpose of reproduction alright and you don't want as I said I never did want my kids to act like the neighbor I didn't want him to do that I won't act like me you know what cuz I was her daddy no all right and see that's the way God wants his children so he never come into the world on the flowery bed of the east he never come into the world through this you know do all the living of life and it be a happy glorious thing he was a child then he was a teenager then he become an adult and before he finished his adulthood he had to die he knew the story of what it would be so what do you what are you getting that brother Dale I'm getting at one time we talk about former rain and latter rain and we claim oh yeah oh well we know what that is former rain is teaching right latter rain is rapture our harvest right but you're not listening you're not thinking according to Bible terminologies you're thinking according to your own concept and you have it labels that away then I come along and I jog you by saying things that sometimes you say well the Prophet didn't say it that way we'll check it out and see if he said it that way he didn't come tell me about it or the Bible doesn't say it that way that's what I asked you where can you go in the world and have a former rain and a lot of rain in one month and it produce your product those got to be saying something out right so what's it saying there is eventually going to come a quickening that will be real close together there's coming a planting of the seed water could belong to that planting and then a harvest of that seed that he's going to do a quick work and literally if you'll take the original where it says he'll do a quick work it literally says he'll do a quick word that's your literal translation you'll do a quick word wor D why because he's going for it incised because that's what he's promised we're the ones that caused it to drag out he's ready he was ready on Azusa Street to bring it forth that mankind wouldn't believe it and accept it when the Prophet walked on this earth he was ready to manifest and bring it all but who would accept it all right now the point I'm getting is what the most important thing is what seemed do you have now remember the quote that we keep giving where the Prophet said false prophets brain false verse true prophets he said brains troopers all right now meaning what you can take a doctrine and you produce it to people and they believe it and they glory in that and you'll see why see I've got right over in jaw a message that I've been able to preach I mean been aiming to preach for many many months but he's right on over in the book of Joel and seeing the very hour that we're living in the time because church we are in the last days science says it man says it we don't have to say it we just say what they say they're the scientists there are the people that says it's one minute till midnight you know they're the ones say in this world could be destroyed in any given second all right but what kind of seed do you have what good is a former rain if you're going to take the rain as the moisture to produce in order to start something to growing and the latter rain to be the moisture that will finish it up what good is it if you got the wrong seed we've glad to read to you the things that we have here of the property where he said the denominational seeds produces and denominations the bad dish produced Baptists the Methodists produce masters the brand of mites are produced in Brattle mines but the true word has struck the world everybody was emphasizing life's not a little bit about this another and I'm I do that I've tried or not and I wanted to say one thing you know the bride she cannot be deceived hindered yeah trouble yes but not deceived but it's only the bride that can't do that everything else will be deceived I've taught this from when I first come in the message I said you think that Adele come that God will anoint this church the bride what I said what's going to be the deceiving is is when He pours out in spirit it's gonna be on everything I've talked this from day one I said all these doctrines they've got a coup so two lords whatever do you realize when that spirit begins to fall they are going to be anointed also and they're going to rejoice and shout and say we've told you our doctrine was right like a brother said he was gonna kill this deer one time no and he said when I get that deer he said then you all know I was right well I thought the word was right it didn't matter what we killed a deer what we done you know I mean I thought it was the word I thought that was the point because there's only one word there's only one bride well you think you're doing a group I didn't say that I didn't say that I'll leave that up for you to think about how can they be so many different doctrines around the world from organized religions you know that each one says they're right and fighting each other how can they do that over one message or one God one Bible that was what bothered me in the Baptist Church I could see that that look at all of this around us everybody says they're right who's right you know what's the everybody says well we're right Lord you wait till the rain falls I say it's doing it now I'm not concerned with later I'm saying it's doing it now because you're seeing now everything coming to maturity you're seeing what all these denominations are doing and it's got real quiet really quiet going on but just don't worry about it's coming we see then you got the believers of the message you've got all of these pulling out and all of these things happening but one day when that spirit begins to fall though they're you sound like you're looking forward to a spirit moving I do because the Prophet said it I read them to either the other day after the door the Gentile churches closed God will ignore the church that I've always believed that do you believe that well I don't know whether he's right or not well then there's other things you won't believe he's right either well I don't look for a revival I got quotes where they ain't no revival the Prophet said there had never been a revival yet for the bride none of where a wide revival no no that's where you're wrong you're looking at it as a sweeping worldwide revival I'm not I'm looking at a gradual up crease upgrading and if you hadn't watched that go riding down the highways let me point out some things to you old brother or Willie Ross not a lot of he knew him and I admit I had the wrong thought in mind because he came up to church here and he said did I come up that 441 highway and he said riding right by them harlot houses and I thought no brother Willie I know where 441 comes to Athens there are a lot of you don't know but a lot of you that old enough you know where it used to run I don't know work still run that way when he used to run down by the river and come down the side and come out he didn't that big old bypass that you got find somebody that I don't find that and you know what was down by the river that was the red-light district of athens and I thought Willie how do you know about the red-light district he said them little old Hollett houses all along the way I didn't while he said you see them little old churches in with old denominations they little bad this here master see I was the one that was thinking wrong he was telling it right he told my churches little Hollett houses huh what you see Church what makes the difference between a a harlot and a true bride there's only one difference between a harlot matru Brian what is it one's got a husband one's got a husband what is our husband the true Word of God all right right okay come on then trying to get it out to you this for the point I'll lay this in and then I'll drop it off and pick it up in the next message don't forget the point I'm trying to make we talked about former rain and latter rain and you asked somebody said what is the form around the letter a' former Ryan is teaching rain brother Dale we got quote quote quote quote and what's the ladder right that's harvest rain or rapture in faith what about the rain falling on the just and the unjust how are you gonna be able to tell the difference well we don't get it that's what I said you go ride down these roads out here you go down through Athens buy them little harlot houses and you ever noticed this there's not a brand new Baptist Church nowhere that I know of now listen to what I'm saying you said well they existed oh no you ain't listening there's spoken word churches their evening life they talk about people in the message now I'm told I ride these roads and show me worse got a sign where our Baptist Church they don't they got an independent name now they don't have Baptists over the front of their churches you hadn't noticed that they don't have Methodists over their churches they don't have presbyterian they have evening light Tabernacles they have shallow they have all kind of names but none of them saying bad mr. Methodist you hadn't noticed that Opie eyes and look what are they doing they're trying to do what the Bible says they're trying to lay down everything because the Bible says what they have you Smith dismiss rip that's not God's name no way right come on they're right but what are they doing according to the Bible it says they've come a time that they'd be seven women to whatever man hotel you remember that much scripture and what did they say said to let us I'm paraphrasing it so I'm a little off with quoting it exactly I didn't mean to break it said let us be called by thy name to take away the reproach you go out and you start telling you say well you Baptists you master this you you which one was that killed John Smith was just a Methodist which one I was about to kill John Smith for his belief well he had a right to believe what he wanted to believe how do you like let us be called by thy name shall Oh evening not to have a neckl let us do away with our names and claim to be the name but what are y'all up there were spoken word Church well what y'all used to be because there's one down here spoken word Church he used to be a Baptist oh you wouldn't are you listening all of these things are coming to light life don't say it that way they're coming to life everybody's trying to become one that's the goal of every time I've talked you from day one I have never taught that the Baptist is gonna be done away with the method it's gonna be done away with the Pentecost is gonna be done away with and we're all gonna become world Church I've never told you nothing like that cuz I never believed it leave them Baptist leave a Methodist living there but I didn't really catch the point until just you know few years ago and I began to look they're doing away with their names they're volunteering their own names to be done away they're coming out to be just any kind of name you can think of instead of being Baptist because they don't want to be derogatory one to the other so we're all just got different names now you didn't talk about that you don't look around the world and pay attention to them let us be called by thy name to do away with our reproach you don't think like that he said well what do you think that mean I know what it means see what women do let let me marry you where I'll have you I'll do away with my maiden name take your name and that'll do away with my love approach though there's supposed to be a reproach for a young lady to have a bunch of babies and her not married I said it's supposed to be it was at one time let's see now if she's been married it's okay for her out ten or fifteen well cause he had us but no you get the point let us be called by thy name just let us be called Christians to do away with our reproach the church world is coming together but it's so sly it's so easy until it's deceiving the bride to sleep I was reading yesterday were when in fact this morning with a Beretta round and said we'd have to overcome soft living and riches that's true well let this thing tighten down a lot of my riches okay let me try to conclude the point to remember it is the same rain that falls on the just and the unjust well if God ain't serving no God that's that deceiving and he wants children that'll grow up to be children to not be deceived what is it the unveiling of God I believe a brother where he said the bride would prove that she's not like Eve well cuz she's gonna stay with the word what was Eve to see don't you want me to keep quoting run around him he said she's deceived on Hebrews 13:8 he realized that Eve was deceived on Hebrews 13:8 he didn't say she isn't this prostitute she is this that she was that over though that's where we get it wrong what was the seven demons that was cast out of Mary Magdalene not one of them is vulgar according to your prophet it's pride is boast it's stuff like that those are the demons we have to fight well I've been in the message longer than you there's all kind of life in yesterday cuz I guess around at that range at that time I said always probably one of them physically you know you know there was the whole life and how young they were well what does that matter what does it matter about it but are you listening that former rain and latter rain listen former rain and latter rain as in no way talking about the seed it's the quickening far the seed the quickening is the Holy Ghost you see but I don't get that brother Dale that you've confusing me you mean God would anoint them out there to do signs and wonders to deceive with according to the Bible and according to the prophet that's right his anointing his dark he loves music you think he don't love mutiny I don't think he loves this rocks nothing all that I don't know don't go off with the wrong direction I don't love nothing like that and I don't think he does either but he loves to be worshipped you know that he honors their priors am i true when sometimes seemingly he don't on our hours you ever thought that away somebody does that to tries to see what we're gonna do so if you don't get nothing out of the message today get one thing for certain our concept or thoughts about former and latter rain has always been to the basis of some kind of a of great outpouring and it is but remember before the rain falls on the seed the seed must be in the ground it's the importance is the seed that is planted not the rain the rain is going to fall I never walked out to a tomato plant with a gallon of water to pour the water on it and the plant look up and sell I don't want that I wanted to come out out of hell but that come out of the ground you said that's silly you know get one of me how are you gonna tell the difference we have the word well now there's about 5,000 different angles of the word in this message now what do we want remember the rain now listen the rain does not change the seed are you with me that's probably about as far as I can get so we'll just emphasize this and quit the rain don't change the seed that's why brother Branham said on Stewart's po-boy dress he said see how important it is the kind of words you preach or plant because remember whatever you plants gonna have a harvest two souls gonna have a harvest son of virtue have a harvest peru's is all these doctrines in the message they're gonna have a harvest to him I thought I've ever tried to warn you you said well brother then we got no message ringing - so I preached on the soul years ago and some come and said I tell you what maybe I was maybe held leaning kind of ward that well you know that's my job well bless God I don't believe that what you believe well I think I come here with this seed in me I like what the brother said yesterday is a good point what do you say germ or what do you call it they call it a germ we're calling it no word all say the word seed coat it's the same thing jerem he said don't matter ask you to how a germ you've got to have the moisture you gotta have the Holy Spirit you say you come here with this gene in you you gotta have the Holy Spirit to make that alive or you don't have a new burner oh I come here with eternal life show me that in the message well I got this quote come on bring the quote because see you're not reading right up above there where the Prophet said if you have eternal then you always was eternal so we don't matter as much about the rain now you listening the latter rain can be falling all over the place to bring the corn to the harvest but you know what it's doing it's bringing up a lot of weeds because why it's the form of rain to that weed seed it ain't a ladder rain cuz of Dayna harvest you can't tell the difference what I'm getting out you go out there and you get red and you say well we need one more rain those farmers know what that means we need if we just get one more rain it will produce but you know what it does it's the latter rain to the corn it's a form of rain to the weed all the same rain this dank plain sensible the point I'm trying to get at is what we're the most important is the word that we hear you said a Holy Ghost angle and quick and false word no it won't quicken falsework but it can quicken the individual and that individual can believe yes but you're saying that the Holy Ghost will quicken that's exactly right so it determines whether or not you know where you're standing there like I said I could have left that kudzu growing out there on the thing you know and we'd have had our house covered over kudzu but I knew what's he planted and I won't know how many seeds he put in the ground I wanted to dig him up and I looked the other day and I ain't kidding you that was what 50 years ago how long's that been I looked at I was up there the other day at my brother's house which was the house we built 65 and you know what I was looking at there's still that same flowerbed was not a thing in the world growing in it we didn't get nothin planted in it and nobody else never planted nothing in that flowerbed it still sitting there but there was that sloped off and I look down up there I dug that thing clean cuz ain't nothin grow it you know listen Church I think it's time what are you saying I think it's time to start growing out a few stones getting rid of some of our ideas and some of our thoughts why because we've had 50 years and what we've done and we stayed with the truth looking at 50 years look what's happening now the devil's going on vacation you don't need to be around the more eat on vacation you hey you're receiving well that's true he's on vacation you know what God we're the one that's doing it they were fighting with each other when they were fighting around horrible and one day they said look quit fighting let's go you know what they wound up in the promised land for 40 years they thought around order arguing over doctrines write multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision I'll preach that when I get done multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision but scripture says you look at the people now and they can't decide what this doctor is right of that doctor they just move into the house the house and they're gonna go over this group look Oh Lord glory I I believe this in the end uh well hey I did remember I think I'd be enough okay yep hey wait I don't know where he gave up our cloth to somebody at the dentist's office but you know what they wound up doing he went back and they told him I wonder there's more he took what 20 20 prayer calls to the dentist and gave it to the girl she went down through the building passing out prayer cloth come back had one and she held out in the spread and said we'd like to have liked so we're gonna just cook them up a bunch of our car welco they believed it now listen Church I'm not throwing those stones or no I'm saying there's good people out there and there are the only difference between them and me and you is God in us you say they don't believe the word they might believe it more than you think if you try to talk to them if you don't get nothing out of the message today remember one time former and latter rain is not talking about what you think is talking about former and latter rain is talking about the quickening it's it's called later we'll get to it it's called a planting rain and a harvest rain but remember it doesn't change the seed it doesn't change anything except producing the crop he said well brother I've heard you say you're looking for a revival the Prophet said it a seal book he said it take him seven known thunder Specter the wake arrived I believe that not a world wide sweeping revival no never I believed it that way but I didn't know about it start with probably said the life worldwide for even revival was the zoo the street let's see what about a revival in your heart I thought a revival was supposed to be individuals I didn't know it was a group I thought it was individuals that had a revival in their heart to make up what was the old policeman standing there when the man asking said where's the Welsh revival he said you're looking at it but you see what I'm getting at former rain and latter rain has to do with the rain that's put up on the seed he's got to be the right seed run around with my word original seed I remember that one real well you told me the Baptist is soda messages so Billy grocer he said in the word has been sown pure and unadulterated from all denominational ideas that's what he said didn't he turn right around in that same point and said as of yet not like a fool he's not fulfilled then you can see where I'm headed so we'll give you a thought I'm headed to the point that I ended the point on the other message little Ron's message begun with the opening of the seals and that's his message from there on out that he was to bring see I'm not ending that message I'm just changing the title I've done that for 40 years I might as well keep on doing it he said well brother there you preach that sunrise yeah five years ago I just keep cycling to beginning come on musicians let's get ready to go eat a Thanksgiving dinner no that's one thing I'm thankful for when you're hungry you're thankful for food right if you ever get this bride spiritually hungry you know what she'll do you'll draw the word she'll pull that word out of the ministry it's already been brought by the Prophet we don't have to worry about it we've got to plan it wait for it we just gotta cook it need it have a good time so just God's Word well we got really let's stand together oh there's honey in the wrong [Music] early in the war you leave your stands for the blood to come honey and oh there's honey [Music] let's remember the sign right person that quickens word you is the same radar that that guy is quickening it oh my brother do you know the Savior whose wondrous kind and true he's the rock of your salvation there's honey in the rock for you oh there's

byways preach the word to the main a few say to every brother Connie for there's honey in the rock for the blood you know brother we're talking about liberty yesterday good because see we need liberty in Christ we say we need freedom freedom comes as Liberty yes but just remember it'll cost you Liberty will cost you well because you got to get rid of a lot of things to be able to accept your Liberty it cost a lot of lives for America to be able to stand as a country Liberty comes with a great price are we willing to pay the price to enjoy the freedom we never had to serve in the military and a lot of that's the odd part about family sometimes some families never had just one person to go to the war you know other families lose nearly all the whole family but you know what thank God thank God for the truth you know what many people stayed here on the homefront they gave a lot to try to help them over there they make clothes and make tanks made our planes guns done a lot of work brought this nation for destruction see God wants us to just believe his word get the seed planted then the rain can fall the seek search that's where you you don't listen to what I'm driving about at the same time one one part of your garden can be getting former rain the part of it can be getting lighter right one person can be standing there outside of you hearing the Word of God and getting the former rain quickly another one standing here in the same message can be receiving latter rain causes the sidelines it's just according to what is working what it's doing it's not important for the Rhine we said well that's no I'm not saying God knows I'm not derogatory and without that spirit there is no hope for the seed but the seed comes first then the rain comes the way we've thought about it and you think about what you've been thinking former and latter rain and you just say former on teaching rain you say teaching rain well let's do it remember we're in the day when they both fall together [Music] they were in a teaching rain the disciples were but there was no way it could have been made alive one day it was quick and unto Him and they became alive in the rain are we ready just a few more minutes okay let's sing one more they say a few more minutes and then we'll be ready [Music] power wonder-working power in the precious blood Oh [Applause] [Music] working power in the blood [Music] [Music] in the precious blood would you be free from you in their power theory there's wonderful [Music] in the [Music] [Applause] power in blood it's power [Music] the world can pop in the blood there is lure in [Applause] father we thank you for today and we pray that what we stand we we didn't know which way to go and ponder about it for nearly a month Lord they try to get away to express what you see father just helpless let the right letter rain now fall upon the word to quicken it take us out of here we know that we stand here too literally today can hear thy word and you can come and quicken it we can have former rain the latter rain right together that fulfills your scripture in the same month so it really had a meaning back tire that was wonderful we just need to know the meaning we love you and we thank you go with us now is lead a natural meal and we are so thankful father for the things that you've given unto us and now for this food that we're going to
