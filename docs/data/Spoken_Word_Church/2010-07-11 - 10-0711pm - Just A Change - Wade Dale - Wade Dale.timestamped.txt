[25:43] of our stuff up there but uh that's
[25:46] exactly why he bought it for so while
[25:48] we're standing let's turn to the book of
[25:50] Colossians and
[25:53] uh we're going to kind
[25:56] of revisit that maybe a little bit of
[25:59] something that we spoke on several years
[26:01] ago on a just a change Prophet said what
[26:05] someone ask him what was the
[26:08] mystery of the
[26:10] translation and he gave him the most
[26:13] profound thing he could say he said it's
[26:15] just a
[26:18] change Colossians
[26:20] 1 verse
[26:24] 12 let's bow our heads
[26:28] de Heavenly Father we pray Lord today
[26:30] that you would come Among Us in a
[26:32] special way Lord and just touch our
[26:35] touch our voice Lord and you be the one
[26:37] that speak father you take the
[26:39] preeminence of the service and father
[26:41] though we be a Cast Away Lord may you
[26:43] use our voice Lord to get to someone
[26:46] Lord to to Quicken your word to them
[26:49] Father we pray Lord that you would just
[26:52] bless us and be with us be with Mom back
[26:54] home Lord as they I would assume they're
[26:56] now listening on the internet through
[26:57] live streaming that you would just touch
[26:59] her father and just be with her bless
[27:01] her be with Dad touch him and of there
[27:04] helping Lord and just be with each
[27:05] one just take Lord each one of us and
[27:09] heal us father you said you sent your
[27:10] word and healed us and delivered us from
[27:12] destruction so as the word Goes Forth
[27:14] father may it not be void you said it
[27:17] wouldn't be you said it would accomplish
[27:18] everything that you said it would that's
[27:20] right so now father we pray that as it
[27:22] goes forth that everything that is there
[27:24] a need for healing or salvation or
[27:27] Deliverance are just a closer walk with
[27:29] you that today Lord that that will be
[27:31] accomplished father you give us the
[27:33] greatest word you gave us the greatest
[27:35] people you gave us the greatest Prophet
[27:38] you gave us the greatest Revelation
[27:39] father in this end time and now we pray
[27:42] that we would humble ourself enough Lord
[27:44] to let you come in and just take
[27:46] preeminence of this Total Service Lord
[27:48] and it Be Your Will and your way father
[27:51] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[27:54] Colossians
[27:55] 1:12 giving thanks and to the Father
[27:58] which has made us meet to be partakers
[28:00] of the inheritance of the Saints in
[28:03] light so we have an
[28:06] inheritance who hath delivered us from
[28:09] the power of Darkness
[28:11] now what I want to look at today is is
[28:14] there's a lot of things that we think we
[28:17] have to
[28:18] do when we really don't have to do
[28:21] anything cuz who's doing all this who
[28:24] hath delivered us from the power of
[28:26] Darkness we can can't do that uh brother
[28:29] Aaron kind of gave you the one side of
[28:31] of being unbelievers this morning well
[28:32] we're going to take this afternoon and
[28:34] become we're going to take what we can
[28:36] and be Believers all right cuz unbelief
[28:39] will kill you but belief will put you in
[28:41] a Rapture all right unbelief will keep
[28:44] you out belief will put you in uh
[28:47] powerful word and hath translated us
[28:50] into the kingdom of his dear son the
[28:54] word translating change is the same
[28:56] thing all right
[28:58] in whom we have Redemption through his
[29:00] blood even the Forgiveness of sins now
[29:03] let's go to Philippians just turn back
[29:05] about two pages in your Bible to
[29:07] Philippians
[29:08] 3 verse
[29:11] 20 and 21 just something today that
[29:14] maybe will will kind of help your faith
[29:16] we're not doing a lot of teaching that
[29:18] for today it'll just be something
[29:20] that'll help your faith cuz we all need
[29:25] help for our conver ation is in
[29:31] heaven from whence also we look for the
[29:34] Savior the Lord Jesus
[29:37] Christ who shall change our vile body
[29:42] who is going to do that the Lord Jesus
[29:44] Christ who shall change our vile body
[29:47] that it may be
[29:50] fashioned all right like unto his
[29:54] glorious body we got to have something
[29:56] original to start with
[29:58] with according to the working whereby he
[30:01] is
[30:03] able not
[30:05] you not Gail
[30:09] Addison according to the workings
[30:11] whereby he is able even to subdue all
[30:16] things now when the Bible says all
[30:18] things it means everything Brother Gary
[30:20] from the top to the bottom unto
[30:24] himself you may be seated and the Lord
[30:26] has bless to the reading of the word if
[30:28] somebody give one of these out right
[30:30] here well brother Donnie's standing up
[30:32] you okay he can get a m thank you just
[30:36] something to kind of read over and keep
[30:38] while we're we're going to read it in
[30:40] just a minute but the word translating
[30:42] change is the same I want you to see
[30:44] today that that we're going to look at
[30:47] this as the Bible says fashion shaped of
[30:51] formed or morphed if you look at your uh
[30:54] what they're giving out you remember the
[30:55] prophet made an illustration
[30:58] about uh oh before we get through here
[31:01] uh sister Rebecca Calhoun keep her in
[31:03] your prayers she is having a baby now so
[31:07] just uh keep her in your prayer she's in
[31:09] going into labor so we thank God for
[31:12] that but now listen we've come to the
[31:15] end time where there's no other age left
[31:19] there's no other Bible to be written
[31:21] there's no other Prophet to come to
[31:23] bring anything in the end time we're the
[31:26] last
[31:28] we are the last form of God this world
[31:31] will ever see whether you believe that
[31:33] or not
[31:35] am let me restate that we're the last
[31:39] form of God this Earth will ever see in
[31:44] the form that it is
[31:49] now one day that's going to strike home
[31:51] and we're going to turn into a
[31:52] Pentecostal
[31:55] church I tell you people we going to
[31:57] have to get a little life amen I sat
[32:00] back there W the other Wednesday night
[32:02] brother past was preaching and y'all
[32:03] were looking at the walls and the steing
[32:05] sleeping playing with the kids looking
[32:07] in the floor I don't know what we're
[32:08] doing during service but we need to be
[32:10] here and we need to listen to what God
[32:12] has for
[32:13] us cuz I don't believe anything is done
[32:17] by chance I don't believe we just come
[32:19] to church just to be a formality we
[32:22] didn't come to church just to say hello
[32:24] how are you I love every one of you to
[32:26] death but I came here today to talk to
[32:28] God the Creator because he's the one
[32:30] that's going to change me not Danny
[32:32] fountain or anyone else the closest
[32:35] friend you have he's not going to change
[32:37] you he may change you in the wrong
[32:41] direction
[32:43] hello but God will never change you in
[32:45] the wrong direction he'll always change
[32:48] you to the word of God like brother Aron
[32:51] said this morning we must be subject to
[32:53] the word of God but we we're not only
[32:55] see Luther could get by with being born
[32:58] again and he could drink beer and smoke
[33:01] a pipe and talk about God because that's
[33:03] all of God that he could see when the
[33:05] Bible said that just shall live by faith
[33:08] now let me tell you something Luther's
[33:11] faith in the just shall live by faith is
[33:15] the same faith that you and I are going
[33:17] to have to have to get out of here cuz
[33:20] there's no big Faith little faith it's
[33:23] faith in God's word that you understand
[33:26] right
[33:27] am that you understand not your neighbor
[33:32] not the guy down the street not the guy
[33:33] sitting over across from you he may be a
[33:37] deceiver but the faith that Luther had
[33:40] is going to take him in a Rapture the
[33:44] faith that Luther had is going to change
[33:46] his
[33:48] body but now you and I have got to come
[33:51] to a place to where we only not we've
[33:54] not got to just have the faith to change
[33:57] our body we've got to have faith to not
[34:00] die right and change our
[34:03] body okay now that's what the prophet
[34:06] had to come to bring he had to tie the
[34:08] loose ends together because you and I
[34:11] were so scrupled up
[34:13] Luther was scrupled up in his Doctrine
[34:16] in a way where he was still baptizing in
[34:19] father son Holy Ghost he was doing the
[34:21] things like that and like I said he
[34:23] would he would um you know smoke a pipe
[34:26] and and sit in a pub being a German and
[34:30] uh but we don't drink German beer and
[34:32] smoke German pipes because that's not
[34:34] what we do we've come to a place to
[34:37] where God has brought us to another
[34:39] position a higher level than what Luther
[34:42] was but remember let's go back to the
[34:44] bottom Luther's faith is what's going to
[34:46] translate him he had to
[34:49] die his faith only took him to a certain
[34:52] place but he had to die but you and I
[34:55] our faith is going to have to take us to
[34:56] a certain place to where we don't die
[34:59] but now is it something that's going to
[35:02] be so far farfetched to where we can't
[35:05] attain to it nowhere God wouldn't have
[35:08] put it in his
[35:09] word if God put it in his word I'm just
[35:12] dumb enough to believe it amen all
[35:16] right how will this translation take
[35:19] place did you have enough Don yes
[35:23] okay maybe you didn't have enough for me
[35:25] oh I got one
[35:27] no I got one I kept one for myself I
[35:30] keep mine in Red so I can I can figure
[35:33] out where I got it from let's see what
[35:35] the prophet said and then let's just
[35:37] base what we're going to say
[35:39] today just off of what this one quote
[35:42] and questions and answers in 1964
[35:46] 830 please explain the mystery of the
[35:49] translation of the
[35:51] Bride just to change see our bodies now
[35:56] let's say our you know what I mean when
[35:57] I say that I don't mean to be sacri
[36:00] religious I don't mean to say ours I
[36:02] don't mean to say this church I mean to
[36:04] say every believer then he goes on and
[36:07] he talks about Abraham we'll get back to
[36:08] that in a minute let's go to what
[36:10] underline part and we cannot receive the
[36:12] promised son that's promised to us today
[36:14] and these bodies that we live in these
[36:17] bodies are sin all right keep going this
[36:21] first conscious controls this body with
[36:24] C taste feel smelling here and that's
[36:26] just got us all scrupled up we reason
[36:29] and everything else but that new body
[36:31] that comes from this born again now
[36:33] where are you born again in your soul
[36:36] today right now sitting where you are
[36:39] with the new birth you are being
[36:42] translated whether you believe that or
[36:44] not but if you're born again you should
[36:45] believe it if you're not born again you
[36:47] won't believe it but that new body that
[36:50] comes from this born again not this
[36:52] first conscience it'll pass away so
[36:54] you're not born again out here where you
[36:56] can see this guy you're looking at today
[36:59] all right you're born again from the
[37:00] inside fella all right it's that inside
[37:04] something that lives everybody
[37:06] understand say Amen congregation
[37:09] replies very weakly amen it's not this
[37:13] outside SE taste feel smelling here it
[37:16] isn't it's subject to death and will die
[37:19] but the inside part of you down in here
[37:21] inside that is the person that cannot
[37:24] die and that's the person that the Life
[37:27] Starts from from this new birth and it
[37:30] builds another person in the image of
[37:33] this person you are around that life you
[37:36] get it now where are you born again
[37:39] again again again in your soul where
[37:42] you're sitting today so that's where
[37:44] it's going to do all its work you don't
[37:48] have a body that's hanging in a closet
[37:50] somewhere or or or you don't have
[37:53] something that's being built in another
[37:55] world but truly we have a soul that's
[37:58] being that that's being formed in the
[38:01] image of God right now today in another
[38:04] dimension that's
[38:05] right because if you're born again today
[38:08] you have eternal life that man never
[38:10] sinned never did a a uh anything wrong
[38:14] right but you're sitting there with it
[38:15] in you today truly it is in another
[38:18] dimension because this Dimension is all
[38:20] death and sorrow and shame and and and
[38:22] all those things now let's listen so
[38:25] potentially it's in here and what is it
[38:28] here's the thought for the day the word
[38:30] promised before the foundation of the
[38:33] world right God when he told Abraham he
[38:37] said I mean when he told Adam he said
[38:39] don't do this do this do this don't do
[38:43] this we broke
[38:46] it you and I human beings he said do
[38:49] this don't do this if you eat that tree
[38:51] you'll be okay if you eat this tree you
[38:53] won't right choice he gave you choice
[38:56] amen but now and we broke it now when we
[38:59] come to Abraham what happened with
[39:01] Abraham he said Abraham I've already
[39:04] done it I'm going to do it there's
[39:06] nothing you're going to have to do with
[39:08] it you're just going to have to walk
[39:10] through the Journey and I'm going to be
[39:13] right there with you all right cuz at
[39:15] the end did Abraham change his own
[39:22] self the word promised before the
[39:25] foundation of the world yeah and around
[39:27] there this only reflects the negative
[39:31] that will reflect the positive the word
[39:33] see the same thing is or the translation
[39:36] of the Bride will be the same thing the
[39:39] word that's in you the body will
[39:41] materialize around that word and the
[39:45] same thing did by Sarah when that old
[39:47] body that she had that first body it had
[39:49] to be changed in order to produce a sun
[39:51] you get it that body could not do it
[39:54] this body cannot do it so it has it'll
[39:55] have to be changed the same way to
[39:58] receive the sun now Abraham did not get
[40:00] up he didn't go to bed with an old 80y
[40:03] old or 90y old Sarah that was blonde
[40:06] headed and blue-eyed when she was young
[40:09] and wake up with a blackheaded blackeyed
[40:13] woman right or he went and said I mean
[40:17] I'm sure he looked over and said who is
[40:19] this beautiful woman laying beside of me
[40:21] but he saw it was Sarah right it wasn't
[40:24] Sarah transformed somewhere else
[40:27] and another woman come into view no no
[40:29] no it was the same Sarah that Abraham
[40:31] started with you get my point all right
[40:35] God's going to change us but it's not
[40:37] going to be a change brothers and
[40:38] sisters like the world says that we're
[40:41] going to throw this old body away and
[40:42] get us a new one where is it going to
[40:44] come from come on oh it comes from God
[40:47] now wait a minute the Bible says that
[40:49] God created this world right this Earth
[40:51] to be inhabited and he got all of our
[40:54] bodies out of this earth right and if
[40:56] you take this world and you take this
[40:58] Earth Back to Before the
[41:00] fall it was sinless that's right perfect
[41:04] that's right right right that's what we
[41:06] were kind of discussing a little bit in
[41:08] the ministers meeting yesterday you and
[41:10] downstairs in the Sunday school class
[41:11] you uh you know the Millennium is a step
[41:14] going back toward the future home it's
[41:16] not the future home there certain things
[41:18] can happen in the Millennium that's not
[41:19] in the future home but God's riding this
[41:22] ship back up he's getting everything
[41:24] back in shape during the millennium so
[41:26] that that future home can come down on
[41:29] the prophet said a redeemed entire Earth
[41:31] right now if the Earth happens that way
[41:35] your body's going to have to happen that
[41:37] way cuz your body goes
[41:40] first a redeemed entire body not a body
[41:44] that we always thought in the
[41:45] denominations that that when the Bible
[41:47] says a new Heaven and a new Earth that
[41:50] this Earth was going to be blown away
[41:51] and we were going to go live on some
[41:52] Cloud up in heaven somewhere playing a
[41:55] heart I don't I don't even like
[41:58] them playing a
[42:00] harp and and me and brother klie would
[42:02] just pass through each other you know we
[42:04] couldn't shake hands right and even our
[42:06] Prophet thought that remember he thought
[42:09] him and brother Neville would just you
[42:10] know come right by each other and say
[42:12] hello well that's not a way to live for
[42:14] eternity that's right I really don't
[42:15] want to do that I agree with you I don't
[42:17] want to do that I want some solid flesh
[42:21] grab hold up say Hey sister God bless
[42:23] your heart that's right glad you made it
[42:29] but now we find out even the Bible was
[42:31] telling us all along that the word new
[42:35] was not annihilate and create again cuz
[42:38] God will not create again he's creating
[42:40] inside of me and you right but he's not
[42:43] going to create a new Heaven and a new
[42:45] Earth cuz everything that he created the
[42:46] first time I believe was perfect man's
[42:49] the one that created the fall the sin
[42:52] and then God had to judge that sin just
[42:55] like he judges me and you in this earth
[42:58] right here cuz I got a new Earth when I
[43:01] got born again I got a new Earth but
[43:04] this Earth is still 50 years old it
[43:06] still was you know it was born again you
[43:08] know 12 years ago and and I'm 50 now and
[43:12] it looks older and this earth looks
[43:14] older but you know what inside of me the
[43:17] word that was promised before the
[43:18] foundation of the world God took that
[43:22] picture of me between 18 and 20 years
[43:24] old and I'm not going to change from
[43:29] that right I'm a young man trapped in an
[43:32] old
[43:34] body so are you don't
[43:37] laugh real a lot of you is real older
[43:40] than I
[43:44] am but in God we're all the same age
[43:49] am and our God is not some God with a
[43:52] beard and a
[43:53] can cuz our God's so old you know who
[43:56] want a God that walk out there and
[43:59] go that's the world the world everything
[44:02] the world sees of God tell me has
[44:05] anybody ever saw a picture of God that
[44:07] this world makes a young man hopping and
[44:10] skipping and jumping no they always make
[44:12] him an old man with a cane yeah long
[44:15] beard you know look kind of like Moses
[44:17] or something you know I don't like
[44:19] that this man was old because of my sin
[44:22] that's why he looked that way but when
[44:25] he resurrected that he was a fresh young
[44:27] man right remember Mary magdalin thought
[44:30] he was a gardener that's right that's
[44:32] why he was so young he got changed back
[44:36] that's right she didn't know him at 20
[44:38] years old so she didn't recognize his
[44:40] form but when he said Mary the voice
[44:44] don't change come on remember brother
[44:46] brandham said that angel one time when
[44:48] that angel spoke to him he said I knew
[44:49] it was an angel that spoke to me when I
[44:51] was a little kid The Voice doesn't
[44:53] change amen you can hear the voice
[44:58] amen bless
[45:00] you but look on the bottom of your page
[45:03] caterpillar to a butterfly right and I
[45:06] know there's a lot of illustrations to
[45:08] that but inside that
[45:11] caterpillar is a
[45:13] butterfly inside that egg is a chicken
[45:16] we were talking about um eggs yesterday
[45:19] at the minister meeting and one brother
[45:20] said wait a minute he stood up great big
[45:23] fell he said wait a minute he said we're
[45:26] not a bunch of chickens I don't want to
[45:28] be classified with a chicken egg he said
[45:30] let's talk about eagle
[45:32] eggs I said okay let's make it an eagle
[45:35] egg then but he uh he didn't want to
[45:39] talk about chicken egg but like brother
[45:41] Joel for he says he said the the the the
[45:44] chicken is the egg revealed right and
[45:48] that's what it is right same way with
[45:51] the caterpillar right the caterpillar is
[45:54] a part of the I mean the butterfly comes
[45:56] out what it was a caterpillar right you
[45:59] can't deny that it was a caterpillar
[46:01] right but inside that caterpillar is
[46:03] that when when the right conditions are
[46:05] met is a butterfly right see now you and
[46:08] I were not born with eternal life you
[46:11] know just be just God we were born in
[46:13] sin shapen in iniquity we needed God we
[46:17] needed life that caterpillar needed life
[46:21] but because the caterpillar has life the
[46:23] caterpillar eats the right thing
[46:26] the caterpillar one day transforms our
[46:30] metamorphous into what a butterfly but
[46:34] all the time inside that
[46:36] caterpillar was a
[46:39] butterfly that's why we need to start
[46:41] look you know brother ROM said one time
[46:42] he said he said we need to look at our
[46:45] in other words paraphrasing we need to
[46:46] look at our brothers and sisters
[46:48] differently than just looking at them
[46:50] through human eyes we need to look at
[46:53] them Through The Eyes of somewhere down
[46:55] inside all that mess that's right is God
[46:58] Amen it's God and if there's not God
[47:03] then you know we need to start praying
[47:04] for those people to get God in their
[47:07] life because it'll change you transform
[47:10] you
[47:11] amen but
[47:14] listen everybody is is
[47:19] so they think that this translation
[47:22] thing I I I just I'm just guessing that
[47:25] this trans ation thing is so far
[47:28] out you know that that we can't attain
[47:30] to it because when we get up every
[47:32] morning it pretty much proves it we have
[47:34] to do this right we have to put little
[47:37] Bing gay on places we didn't have before
[47:39] we didn't know we had muscles
[47:41] there brother collie I know you know
[47:43] that cuz you
[47:45] smiling he used to climb up in a deer
[47:47] stand now they now I think that's why
[47:49] they built ground
[47:52] blind we used to when we first started
[47:54] hunting man we we'd get get on those
[47:56] Baker tree stands we go 40 ft in the air
[47:58] and I mean I'm talking about climbing
[47:59] with your arms holding like this you
[48:01] know going up the tree then they made
[48:03] them two piece where you could sit down
[48:04] and do this now they made them where you
[48:06] can sit on the ground I like them on the
[48:09] ground too myself I don't don't bother
[48:11] me any but uh brother Hal Thomas when he
[48:14] hurt his foot I gave him a uh I gave him
[48:17] a little sniper Shack thing to step
[48:19] behind he says he uses it all the time
[48:21] right but thank God for that that's kind
[48:23] of a metamorphosis in the in the human
[48:25] way we met metamorph into it's what I
[48:28] always said about U old people you know
[48:31] having those all those hearing aids and
[48:32] Band-Aids and walking aids and all those
[48:35] AIDS things that they need so but you
[48:37] know what that's the human part but we
[48:40] got to see that that human part has got
[48:43] to be done away with but not annihilated
[48:48] like we go back to the earth the earth
[48:49] is not going to be
[48:52] destroyed and then we go live somewhere
[48:54] else on a new
[48:56] Earth no it's this Earth that God made
[49:00] to start
[49:01] with just clean off same thing happened
[49:06] to you and I when the night that you
[49:07] were born again or day or whatever it
[49:09] was that you were born
[49:11] again it didn't take you and just you
[49:15] know put a bomb in your inside and blow
[49:17] you up and then out stepped in you guy
[49:19] or girl or a woman whatever no actually
[49:23] probably you didn't change any of your
[49:26] facial expressions except for maybe you
[49:28] cleaned your mouth up a little bit like
[49:29] mine was you know and you cleaned your
[49:32] ways up but you were the same person
[49:34] that go that everybody could see on the
[49:35] outside amen now but what did God do he
[49:39] took the
[49:40] fire the fire of God that's what we're
[49:43] studying downstairs and I'll give you a
[49:45] little something to study on the uh
[49:49] Millennium is going to come from the
[49:51] fire of man which is the atomic fire
[49:54] brother BR said atomic will explode
[49:56] right now that don't kill PE that don't
[49:58] kill
[49:59] Souls right it just kills people and
[50:02] puts them in a in a dimension right but
[50:05] when you come to the to the to the
[50:07] Battle of Gog and MOG the Bible says the
[50:10] fire of God brother brandham said the
[50:13] fire would fall from God and God's the
[50:16] only one that can kill us all right so
[50:19] we come to that place to where God is to
[50:21] the place then where he can take and
[50:23] with his fire he can kill Spirits right
[50:28] so let's take that with you and I the
[50:30] Bible said you'll be baptized with Holy
[50:32] Ghost and
[50:34] Fire okay you're baptized with the Holy
[50:36] Ghost at your new birth right he burns
[50:38] out the inside guy but what's he going
[50:40] to do at this translation he's not going
[50:43] to annihilate the outside guy he's just
[50:45] going to take the fire of God burn all
[50:47] them Spirits out of you I hope that's
[50:49] what he's doing now right I hope we
[50:51] don't wait till we get to the end and
[50:53] say I'm ready now no we can't do that
[50:57] God it's a
[50:59] process you know why it's a process
[51:01] because he thinks about us cuz with God
[51:05] from the beginning to the end is this
[51:07] close together amen but with me and you
[51:09] it's a journey and you know what he kind
[51:12] of goes along that Journey with us and
[51:13] waiting on us because remember the Bible
[51:15] says that if you're born again right now
[51:17] that your soul is sitting in Heavenly
[51:19] places why because it's redeemed it's
[51:22] already finished there's nothing else
[51:23] for God to do to your soul today if
[51:25] you're born
[51:26] again except just keep let you keep
[51:29] feeding on the word caterpillar what
[51:32] happened to that caterpillar it gets
[51:35] big no we're not going to make a
[51:36] caterpillar out of this it gets big and
[51:40] it bursts open why does it burst open
[51:43] cuz it's eat all it needs when it eats
[51:46] all that it needs it burst open into a
[51:48] butterfly and that's what's going to
[51:50] happen to you and I this translation
[51:52] thing people is not so much that we
[51:54] can't believe that God's already started
[51:57] it right now right
[52:01] now job even stood up and he said though
[52:05] the skin worms destroy this
[52:07] body in my flesh I'll see God in my
[52:12] flesh that's right so whether you get
[52:14] and you know AIDS doesn't mean anything
[52:16] now you could die tomorrow you could die
[52:19] in 15
[52:22] minutes had a lot of friends in the past
[52:26] year they went to school with that was
[52:28] actually younger than me they're dead
[52:32] they're gone that's
[52:34] right so don't pride yourself in that
[52:37] you're too young or don't say that it's
[52:39] so bad because you're so old that's
[52:41] right because in God that really doesn't
[52:44] matter but let's get into what we're
[52:46] doing here we're going to be here all
[52:49] night but in my flesh job said I'll see
[52:54] God My Flesh right not another flesh in
[52:58] my flesh I'll see God right
[53:02] now there's one thing that will not
[53:05] change you that will that will stop your
[53:07] change without death and that's unbelief
[53:11] what brother Aron was talking about this
[53:12] morning which is what sin it's not
[53:15] smoking drinking cursing running around
[53:17] that's not sin sin is disbelief in the
[53:20] word of God that's what killed Luther
[53:27] oh you get quiet but that's what killed
[53:29] Luther because Luther couldn't attain we
[53:33] say well Luther only had so much word
[53:35] well it was only so much word allotted
[53:36] to him I know but this Bible what didn't
[53:39] he read that just shall live by faith
[53:42] the Bible that the Bible he read didn't
[53:43] just have one page in it the Bible he
[53:46] read was just like this Bible you and I
[53:48] are reading but there was a revelation
[53:51] involved to him of just a small amount
[53:54] that he could see but there was another
[53:57] picture behind all that but he could
[53:58] only see through a very small glass but
[54:02] what you and I are in the end time is is
[54:04] we've had this whole Veil brought back
[54:07] we've had the whole Veil opened up to
[54:09] where we can see the word of God you
[54:11] know jun's um sister and and and um
[54:16] Kathy was discussing the Bible and they
[54:18] said they they don't think that you know
[54:22] that wearing shorts and not you know
[54:23] just like the denomination world do they
[54:25] don't care what they
[54:27] wear uh don't think that the word of God
[54:30] is all
[54:31] infallible and that's what Satan has
[54:33] tried to do down through through time
[54:35] he's he's made people disbelieve what's
[54:37] always been
[54:39] here read that quote again the word
[54:42] promised before the foundation of the
[54:44] world right now folks let me tell you
[54:47] something I know Dick's going to like
[54:48] this
[54:49] one you can take that Bible right here
[54:54] and throw it away
[54:55] and do whatever you want to with it
[54:57] disbelieve it it's not going to matter
[55:00] to
[55:01] God it's not going to matter to it
[55:04] didn't matter God did not get nervous
[55:06] when Abraham got 100 years old right
[55:09] right he didn't start
[55:12] shaking he said okay boys he said now
[55:15] it's time and he said you're not going
[55:18] to do it I'm going to do it right
[55:21] Abraham there was no way I've got a
[55:23] couple of quotes that I didn't bring
[55:24] brother randam said find me a way to
[55:27] translate your body from something on
[55:29] this
[55:30] Earth find me a way to heal a broke bone
[55:34] he he was talking about going to a drug
[55:35] store you going go to the drug store and
[55:37] say hey I got a broke arm give me some
[55:39] Sav to put on this on this broke arm and
[55:42] it'll just instantly go away there's
[55:44] nothing on this Earth nothing on this
[55:46] Earth that's going to translate us it's
[55:49] got to be what we believe amen has
[55:52] already been done right
[55:56] already I said been done that's right
[56:00] amen now we can build a case and say
[56:03] well this is the going wrong and this is
[56:04] going wrong it didn't matter with
[56:07] God God has promised it and he's going
[56:10] to have somebody to do it
[56:13] right and and and he's going to have
[56:15] somebody in this end time right now
[56:17] that's alive right the dead ones can't
[56:19] do it right it's got to be somebody
[56:22] alive breathing right
[56:25] right breathing alive they got to be
[56:29] here but folks the first thing let's
[56:31] turn to Philippians 3 back there
[56:34] again but the inside today has got to be
[56:38] settled we have got to settle ourself
[56:40] that the inside of our soul is already
[56:44] Eternal or we're not going to take a
[56:46] change right there's going to be nothing
[56:48] to change you with because what your Mom
[56:51] and Daddy give you is not going to
[56:53] change you I'll promise you that that's
[56:55] right remember our mom and Dad tried to
[56:58] beat our nature out of
[57:04] us
[57:06] hello Sterling's leaving
[57:16] so daddy told me one time I was 30 years
[57:19] old and I was just sitting at home and
[57:21] something happened he said Son as long
[57:24] as you put your under my table you're
[57:25] going to do what I tell you to do I
[57:27] don't care if you're 30 or 300 oh I said
[57:30] yes
[57:35] sir verse
[57:38] 13 everything is summed up in this right
[57:41] here and this is the most simple
[57:43] scripture and this may be the most quote
[57:45] unquote simple message you'll ever hear
[57:48] me preach but it's come to the basis
[57:50] that that we've got to be like Abraham
[57:55] we've got to know that that promise was
[57:58] given to
[57:59] you and regardless come what may whether
[58:03] your mama your daddy your brother your
[58:05] sister it's hard I know it's hard it's
[58:08] see Terence and Anna have always been
[58:11] Believers so it's not to me it's kind of
[58:13] commonplace that our family can sit down
[58:16] and talk about the word of God or or be
[58:19] you know and I and I deem that an
[58:20] absolute honor and a privilege amen but
[58:24] now has got family that's just rotten
[58:29] Sinners and they just beat on her all
[58:32] the
[58:32] time God's going to have to give you a
[58:34] reward for that because then she's going
[58:37] she's putting up with a lot more than I
[58:38] put up
[58:39] with so you know but I'm saying what I'm
[58:42] saying is Abraham probably had a lot of
[58:45] people that he told he was going to have
[58:46] a baby with at about 99 years old and
[58:49] they probably laughed at
[58:52] him look at poor old job job was was
[58:54] going through everything he went through
[58:56] all his best friends said job what' you
[58:59] do they didn't say job can we help you
[59:02] you know till till elu came by which was
[59:05] type of Christ came by and was telling
[59:08] telling
[59:10] joob hey job just get yourself out of
[59:12] the way right the other three was like
[59:16] what' you do job you go out and have a
[59:18] beer on the side over here somewhere or
[59:20] or I didn't see in church for three
[59:22] Sundays in a row I what's going on here
[59:25] no they should have said list let's pray
[59:27] about
[59:28] this but remember eloh you said I was
[59:30] sent from the presence of God and that's
[59:32] where we want all things to come from
[59:34] the presence of God whether friends do
[59:36] away with us where family does away with
[59:38] us irregardless of what happens listen
[59:41] to this Brethren I count not myself to
[59:44] have apprehended but this one thing and
[59:47] here's a great Apostle
[59:49] Paul one thing that I've apprehended in
[59:53] other words in other words I've got got
[59:54] it if you apprehend something that means
[59:56] you had to go out and get it when the
[59:58] police go out they apprehend a suspect
[1:00:00] right this man's been apprehended but
[1:00:03] this one
[1:00:04] thing I do forgetting those things which
[1:00:08] are
[1:00:09] behind now I know the devil right
[1:00:12] now he's turning the screws and you're
[1:00:15] going back about 30 years or 25 years or
[1:00:19] 15 years or 15
[1:00:22] minutes you did so and so
[1:00:25] you did this you did that let me tell
[1:00:29] you something people it's the same devil
[1:00:33] that sat on Abraham's shoulder and said
[1:00:36] Abraham let's just be honest Abraham you
[1:00:39] can't even perform your that you can't
[1:00:41] do anything to this and Abraham's like I
[1:00:46] know I
[1:00:48] know he just kept walking that's why we
[1:00:51] got to have the faith of Abraham that's
[1:00:53] why Abraham was the the father of our
[1:00:55] faith Abraham hey and Abraham got on his
[1:00:58] face he he laughed before God he give
[1:01:00] his wife away did that bother
[1:01:04] God nope or he wouldn't to give that
[1:01:07] promise to Abraham that's
[1:01:09] right but he knew Abraham was looking at
[1:01:12] a
[1:01:13] place right here in his
[1:01:16] journey not the journey but a place and
[1:01:20] that's what we'll talk about in just a
[1:01:21] second Brethren I count not myself to
[1:01:24] have apprehended but this one thing I
[1:01:27] do forgetting those things which are
[1:01:29] behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:01:32] things which are before I press toward
[1:01:35] the mark for the prize of the High
[1:01:36] Calling of God in Christ Jesus a lot of
[1:01:39] people stop there let's read verse 15
[1:01:41] let us therefore now Paul didn't leave
[1:01:44] us out he said let us therefore as many
[1:01:49] as be
[1:01:50] perfect ah how about that
[1:01:55] what's he doing he's giving us a
[1:01:57] position not just everybody sting in the
[1:01:59] congregation because you got M Believers
[1:02:00] unbelievers True Believers sitting right
[1:02:02] here today I didn't say that Prophet did
[1:02:05] he said those as many as be perfect now
[1:02:10] we'll never be perfect in other man's
[1:02:12] eyes but in God if you're born again
[1:02:13] today whether whatever done anybody
[1:02:15] tells you you're perfect I'll tell you
[1:02:18] you're perfect if you're born in today
[1:02:19] you're perfect that's right you're just
[1:02:22] as perfect as god is perfect yes
[1:02:25] all right as many as be perfect be thus
[1:02:28] minded what go back to the scriptures
[1:02:31] and read that that's what he's telling
[1:02:32] you be like be the same be thus minded
[1:02:35] and if in anything ye be otherwise
[1:02:38] minded God shall reveal even this unto
[1:02:42] you we come to a place that where that
[1:02:44] we
[1:02:46] have I have come to a place in my life
[1:02:51] that sometimes we get like Martin Luther
[1:02:53] I know some of you may have seen the the
[1:02:54] movie about Martin Luther but he tried
[1:02:57] to do in his conversion he tried to do
[1:02:59] so much Penance cuz he was Catholic he
[1:03:02] would lay on the floor he would
[1:03:06] crawl and he would actually talk to
[1:03:08] those demons that were talking to him
[1:03:10] about you know bad things and bad things
[1:03:12] that were going on in in in in his
[1:03:15] head and a priest one time told him pre
[1:03:18] Catholic priest told him said
[1:03:22] Luther you're going to go
[1:03:25] crazy and shortly after that is when God
[1:03:29] showed Martin Luther in the
[1:03:32] Bible that there was nothing that he
[1:03:35] could do that the just shall live by
[1:03:40] faith he turned right around and started
[1:03:43] preaching to his congregation to have
[1:03:46] faith in what God Said and that
[1:03:49] transformed a whole continent just by
[1:03:52] those few words the just shall live by
[1:03:54] faith Fai now here's a man that would
[1:03:55] crawl up steps he would he would lay
[1:03:57] prostate for
[1:03:59] hours like in a cross but he would lay
[1:04:01] with his face on the Rocks trying to get
[1:04:04] those evil thoughts out of his mind and
[1:04:05] trying to get all these things of the
[1:04:07] world that we deal with every day out of
[1:04:10] his head you can't do
[1:04:14] that Danny I've come to
[1:04:19] conclusion that I'm going to take what
[1:04:21] God
[1:04:23] Said because if Donnie fush said so it
[1:04:26] could be
[1:04:28] wrong but if God said
[1:04:31] so that's
[1:04:33] perfect if God said
[1:04:36] so that's why we have to be in this word
[1:04:39] right here this is what God Said
[1:04:42] So it ain't man it ain't man's ideas or
[1:04:45] theology it's what God Said God said so
[1:04:48] God said he's going to change or
[1:04:50] translate a group of people I'm just
[1:04:52] dumb enough to believe I'm going to be
[1:04:53] there right
[1:04:55] right now I'm going to prove whether I
[1:04:58] Believe It or Not by my
[1:05:01] journey all
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:05] now if your inside is
[1:05:09] settled then just let that
[1:05:11] work to the
[1:05:13] outside little
[1:05:15] caterpillar just keep
[1:05:18] eating but in second Peter
[1:05:21] 1 I want you to realize something
[1:05:24] something let's read
[1:05:26] that cuz I don't really think we
[1:05:28] understand the new birth like we should
[1:05:30] right I brother Bram said that right I
[1:05:34] have the quote where he said that that
[1:05:36] the new birth is the most ill taught
[1:05:38] thing right right well now it hadn't
[1:05:41] changed much in the 40 years since he's
[1:05:43] been gone right
[1:05:46] right and I hope some of the ministers
[1:05:48] don't hear this but there was a lot of
[1:05:51] things said yesterday that I still
[1:05:53] believe there's a lot of people even
[1:05:54] message preachers that do not know how
[1:05:56] to preach the new birth
[1:05:59] amen cuz nobody yesterday except brother
[1:06:03] Tim Calhoun said it was the birth of the
[1:06:05] word nobody it was this it was that it
[1:06:08] was this it was this it was doing this
[1:06:11] doing it's a birth of the word amen that
[1:06:14] you hold in your heart you cannot become
[1:06:17] born again if you haven't heard from God
[1:06:19] right what's he going to
[1:06:22] birth he's got a birth or Quicken the
[1:06:25] word that you hold on to right even
[1:06:28] brother brandham said the little woman
[1:06:30] at the
[1:06:31] well right her mama taught her that
[1:06:37] there was a messiah coming cuz she said
[1:06:39] we know when Messiah comes he'll do
[1:06:41] these things well if she hadn't known
[1:06:43] that she couldn't have said that we know
[1:06:46] she had been previously taught well now
[1:06:49] was God looking at a prostitute standing
[1:06:51] there uhuh no no he was not looking at a
[1:06:56] prostitute standing
[1:06:59] there cuz she went down to her country
[1:07:02] and and just set the whole world on fire
[1:07:04] all right second Peter
[1:07:07] 1 verse
[1:07:19] 4 let's just read verse one Simon Peter
[1:07:23] a servant and apostel of Jesus Christ to
[1:07:25] them that have obtained light precious
[1:07:28] Faith with us through the righteousness
[1:07:31] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] now Peter knew where his righteousness
[1:07:37] Came
[1:07:40] From Grace and peace be multiplied unto
[1:07:42] you through the knowledge of God and of
[1:07:43] Jesus our lord according as his divine
[1:07:46] power hath given unto us all things that
[1:07:48] pertaineth unto life and godliness
[1:07:51] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:07:52] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:07:54] are given now what is the word given
[1:07:57] that means it's a gift somebody gives
[1:07:59] you something it's it's given to you
[1:08:01] right now if it was something that you
[1:08:04] had to pay for they sell you
[1:08:07] something but when they give you
[1:08:09] something it's a gift nothing has to be
[1:08:11] exchanged to get a
[1:08:13] gift whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:08:17] great and precious promises that by
[1:08:19] these you might be partakers of the
[1:08:22] divine nature right
[1:08:27] deity in human flesh right
[1:08:32] amen deity in human flesh even had a
[1:08:37] preacher stand up yesterday and said
[1:08:38] that it wasn't God that dwelt in your
[1:08:40] soul it was a it was a um oh what he try
[1:08:44] to say anyway it was just something I
[1:08:45] didn't understand but my Bible says the
[1:08:49] divine nature of God
[1:08:51] right that's his soul
[1:08:55] exactly the very soul of almighty God
[1:08:57] which makes you
[1:08:59] God Amen not an OB wor
[1:09:02] exactly it makes you God having escaped
[1:09:05] the corruption that is in the world
[1:09:06] through lust which is in other words
[1:09:09] what we think here right then add to
[1:09:12] your faith virtue and all those things
[1:09:14] but partakers of the divine nature
[1:09:17] right thank you
[1:09:21] divine right there's only one Divine
[1:09:24] that's right and that's God Amen he's
[1:09:27] not part Divine and part not
[1:09:30] Divine that's you and me right he's
[1:09:34] Divine from head to toe right every hair
[1:09:37] on his head is divine
[1:09:39] right and what did he do with this
[1:09:41] divine nature right he give it to you
[1:09:44] and me that's
[1:09:45] right that's why the Bible can say ye
[1:09:47] are Gods I wanted to stand up yesterday
[1:09:49] and say what about that
[1:09:51] yeah cats have cats dogs have dogs God
[1:09:57] has it's hard for you to say it or you
[1:09:59] have just said it Christian God
[1:10:03] makes
[1:10:04] right anything less you're the
[1:10:07] devil oh my amen right that's right I
[1:10:12] wanted you to say that L anything less
[1:10:14] than that you're the devil that's right
[1:10:17] that's
[1:10:18] right ain't that right that's right yeah
[1:10:21] because the devil is just that much
[1:10:23] lower than
[1:10:25] God and he had a create he knew he was
[1:10:29] created by that
[1:10:31] God but let's forget about the devil
[1:10:33] deity residing in human flesh right now
[1:10:37] if deity resides in human flesh then the
[1:10:41] Soul is already been glorified
[1:10:45] amen given white robes whatever you want
[1:10:49] to say this opens up all the Bible
[1:10:52] that's why the prophet had to bring
[1:10:53] bring us a new birth not different from
[1:10:57] Luther right but he expounded more on it
[1:11:01] to give us more power come
[1:11:05] on because Luther could have read this
[1:11:08] and and and and been you know said well
[1:11:10] maybe maybe no he lived on the just
[1:11:13] shall live by faith you and I have to
[1:11:16] live by every word that proceedeth out
[1:11:18] of the mouth of God right and believe it
[1:11:22] right now
[1:11:26] the Bible even says those who he's truly
[1:11:27] Justified he's already
[1:11:30] glorified so what's our
[1:11:35] problem unbelief
[1:11:38] right
[1:11:41] unbelief because God said so and we
[1:11:45] don't believe
[1:11:47] it right this outside man that Mom and
[1:11:51] Daddy gave you is not going to take you
[1:11:53] any anywhere right it's the display of
[1:11:56] what's on the inside of you amen is
[1:11:59] going to take you somewhere right
[1:12:01] because that divine nature and still
[1:12:03] even folks listen with a divine nature
[1:12:05] of
[1:12:06] God you can still limit
[1:12:10] God and
[1:12:15] die
[1:12:17] you you ever heard brother BR make a
[1:12:20] real just a statement that was
[1:12:22] outstanding to me but I understand it
[1:12:23] more every day he said you can grieve
[1:12:26] the holy
[1:12:27] spirit cuz the Bible says grieve not the
[1:12:29] Holy Spirit where by yourself now you
[1:12:31] won't lose the Holy Ghost it's not like
[1:12:32] the Holy Ghost is you lose it and you
[1:12:34] die and go to hell no God's not an
[1:12:36] Indian giver when God gives you the
[1:12:39] divine nature he wants you to have it
[1:12:42] and he says to you come on people he
[1:12:44] said to you the same as he said to Jesus
[1:12:46] on the River Jordan he said this is my
[1:12:48] son in whom I am pleased to
[1:12:51] dwell if he gives you the divine nature
[1:12:54] of God he's pleased to dwell in you
[1:12:56] whether I don't like you or whether you
[1:12:58] don't like me that has nothing to do
[1:13:01] with exactly right right it's what God
[1:13:04] Said right all
[1:13:08] right all this goes
[1:13:11] together because our soul is sitting in
[1:13:14] Heavenly places that's right while our
[1:13:16] body is most of the time in hellish
[1:13:20] places so it's those two things working
[1:13:22] against each other
[1:13:24] but which one wins the old Chief says
[1:13:28] the one you feed the
[1:13:29] most now you're not going to kill the
[1:13:32] Holy Ghost but you
[1:13:33] can grieve him brother brand said he's a
[1:13:38] gentleman I was reading the other day
[1:13:40] I'm going back in the 56 and 57 series
[1:13:43] or 56 and yeah 56 57 series and reading
[1:13:46] and continuing end of the prayer lines
[1:13:48] cuz he had a lot of prayer lines during
[1:13:49] that time and he would uh he say don't
[1:13:52] move around
[1:13:54] right he said you're upsetting the Holy
[1:13:57] Spirit he said stay in your seat he said
[1:14:00] because he's very timid and he said
[1:14:03] he'll leave the
[1:14:05] building
[1:14:08] now got to know what he meant
[1:14:12] folks what do we do about that come on
[1:14:15] brother that Holy Ghost didn't leave
[1:14:17] when the prophet left that's right it's
[1:14:20] the same
[1:14:22] guy amen and us doing the same thing
[1:14:25] right that those people were
[1:14:28] doing think about that that Holy Spirit
[1:14:31] didn't leave because whatever happened
[1:14:33] to that Prophet is happening to you and
[1:14:35] I because it's the same God right same
[1:14:37] Holy Ghost same atmosphere the only
[1:14:40] thing is is there's not one person that
[1:14:43] has a gift of Divine Healing like that
[1:14:45] Prophet had right right right but even
[1:14:48] with that I I can take a hold of what he
[1:14:52] said right you know that the prophet
[1:14:54] that that Prophet would do two things
[1:14:56] you know restore all this back and take
[1:14:58] us on in the word well God never took
[1:15:00] that with the
[1:15:02] prophet he actually give it to me and
[1:15:05] you come on so the gift of Divine
[1:15:07] Healing is still
[1:15:09] here I've said many times before the
[1:15:12] Bible said that the word was the
[1:15:13] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:15:15] the heart a long time before William
[1:15:16] Bram gotad right right so it was the
[1:15:19] word that he brought yes that was the
[1:15:22] discerner of the thoughts intense of the
[1:15:23] heart wasn't because there was a little
[1:15:25] man he said I'm just standing here right
[1:15:27] when he comes I'm just here he took over
[1:15:30] that
[1:15:32] vessel that's
[1:15:34] why you and I are going to have to come
[1:15:37] to a
[1:15:38] place just like that
[1:15:40] Prophet hear me out not for me to stand
[1:15:43] here and and let God Encompass this body
[1:15:47] for me to call out your sin hey the word
[1:15:49] of God's doing it I'm not the word of
[1:15:52] God's calling out your sin right now if
[1:15:54] you're not born again inside of you
[1:15:55] something's going hey I got a problem or
[1:15:58] hey he's crazy or hey that you know
[1:16:00] there's that unbelief part but he said I
[1:16:03] got myself out of the way and he said
[1:16:05] God use my voice right to do what what
[1:16:10] did he do because he said no Divine
[1:16:13] Healing no Resurrection right so what he
[1:16:17] said what you see in part he said one
[1:16:20] day you're going to see in its fullness
[1:16:22] man if that was parted what's the
[1:16:25] fullness going to be righten I even read
[1:16:28] one the yesterday U Friday
[1:16:31] Thursday he was making a comment about
[1:16:34] the bull and the bees and all that you
[1:16:36] know sending them back in the Hornets
[1:16:38] and all
[1:16:39] that and I'm trying to get it straight
[1:16:41] what he said but he said in other words
[1:16:43] he said that's happened before while I
[1:16:46] was alone in the woods yeah he said I've
[1:16:49] prayed in other words he was praying for
[1:16:50] animals that was in the woods right a
[1:16:53] deer hunter that's kind
[1:16:55] of that's that's kind of hard to
[1:16:58] understand you know you want to kill
[1:16:59] something then you want to pray for it
[1:17:01] but he knew he said I'm not a killer I'm
[1:17:03] a Hunter he said there's a difference
[1:17:06] and being a killer and being a hunter
[1:17:08] all right but see God was so much a part
[1:17:11] of that man's life till the only thing
[1:17:13] you know I believe the only thing that
[1:17:14] was holding William brandom here was me
[1:17:15] and
[1:17:16] you right
[1:17:18] right right I believe that the only
[1:17:22] thing that held William Brenham from
[1:17:23] taking a Rapture a translation of his
[1:17:26] body was me and you cuz we hadn't come
[1:17:29] yet right and we were spoken promised
[1:17:32] word before the foundation of the world
[1:17:35] and we had to come amen we were locked
[1:17:38] up in our mom and daddy or denomination
[1:17:40] or if you were alive or whatever sin but
[1:17:44] we had to come because the word of God
[1:17:46] promised it that's the only thing
[1:17:48] because he would be so much now what
[1:17:49] would happen here's a man standing here
[1:17:52] and we think well this you know it's
[1:17:55] going to be real hard for God to change
[1:17:56] this body we got to get out of that
[1:17:59] thought
[1:18:01] process because
[1:18:03] remember look down Through the Ages just
[1:18:05] take for example
[1:18:09] Elijah take
[1:18:11] Elijah Elijah went
[1:18:14] somewhere right
[1:18:16] right it was translated right Enoch went
[1:18:19] somewhere right God had to change his
[1:18:22] body
[1:18:24] because there's no way a human can just
[1:18:26] vanish from the face of the Earth
[1:18:28] without his body being
[1:18:31] somewhere Elijah went up in a chariot of
[1:18:35] fire think of all the other things what
[1:18:37] about old Phillip one
[1:18:39] day right what happened to Phillip
[1:18:42] Philip standing here
[1:18:44] preaching in a congregation and he
[1:18:49] vanishes about 300 miles away he
[1:18:54] reappears talks to a
[1:18:56] unit and even brother brandom says
[1:19:00] God here he come right
[1:19:03] back in a human body right that Mom and
[1:19:07] Daddy gave him right God changed his
[1:19:11] atoms we have a problem people and the
[1:19:14] problem is between our ears that we
[1:19:16] believe God can do this cuz we've been
[1:19:20] taught that we're going to die right
[1:19:22] we've been taught that we're getting
[1:19:23] older and we getting aches and we
[1:19:24] getting pains what about the three
[1:19:26] Hebrew
[1:19:28] children go dump yourself in a
[1:19:32] furnace and if God's not there see what
[1:19:34] will happen
[1:19:36] right I said if God's not there right
[1:19:39] what will happen but if God's there it
[1:19:41] was just hot enough to burn the latches
[1:19:44] off of their wrist right and the Bible
[1:19:47] said they were walking
[1:19:49] around down there with a man right and
[1:19:52] you know what Shadrach mesach and
[1:19:54] abedo walked out of that furnace and
[1:19:57] just went and live normal
[1:19:59] lives God had changed their
[1:20:03] atoms to something that it wasn't what
[1:20:05] their mom and daddy had give them it was
[1:20:08] something that God had given
[1:20:09] them and there's one key to this whole
[1:20:12] Pro this whole situation they weren't
[1:20:14] born again that's
[1:20:16] right that's right Elijah wasn't born
[1:20:20] again right Enoch wasn't born again
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:25] you and I are born again
[1:20:26] amen we ought to believe it more than
[1:20:28] they ever believe it
[1:20:30] amen what about Jesus we'll get back to
[1:20:34] brother Brown and then we'll quit let's
[1:20:36] get to Jesus Jesus walked up to a group
[1:20:38] of people one day and it's just the way
[1:20:40] I Think Jesus walked up to a group of
[1:20:42] people there was like several so many
[1:20:44] thousand
[1:20:45] people he said we're hungry he said what
[1:20:49] we got he said we got Five Loaves and
[1:20:50] two
[1:20:51] fishes
[1:20:53] Jesus didn't have to go get behind a
[1:20:56] rock right and pray about it
[1:20:59] right you didn't have to you know if it
[1:21:02] would have been me and you come on if it
[1:21:04] have been me and you first thing we said
[1:21:05] all right go to Walmart get us some
[1:21:08] flour uh we need a we need a big pot and
[1:21:12] some butter and some lard um we need to
[1:21:15] somebody need Dan you need to go catch
[1:21:16] fish for us about 5,000 if you don't
[1:21:18] mind in just a few minutes um and um G
[1:21:23] you need to go get us some wood and
[1:21:25] somebody get a fire going and in about
[1:21:27] two days we'll feed these
[1:21:29] people what Jesus
[1:21:32] do he took that bread and when he broke
[1:21:35] it he blessed it sorry thank you sister
[1:21:38] he blessed it when he broke it and
[1:21:40] handed it to the
[1:21:42] disciples something
[1:21:45] happened something happened it didn't
[1:21:47] just come back a doughy glob of
[1:21:50] bread it was cooked
[1:21:54] brother bam said one time he said I
[1:21:55] wonder what Adam was released in that
[1:21:58] Miracle he took the fish and blessed it
[1:22:02] and started handing the fish and when he
[1:22:03] did there would another one reappear
[1:22:05] already
[1:22:07] cooked and the people ate them so it
[1:22:09] didn't kill
[1:22:10] them and you know what there was enough
[1:22:13] left over so if they wanted more I like
[1:22:16] God's way of doing things amen not just
[1:22:18] barely having enough I like to have some
[1:22:20] left over yes he had about 12 baskets
[1:22:23] left over of this food that come from
[1:22:26] nowhere
[1:22:28] right and we worry about what God's
[1:22:31] going to do to this
[1:22:34] body when that man that did
[1:22:38] that is inside of
[1:22:41] us right
[1:22:43] now right now yes now brother brandham
[1:22:47] walks up to the
[1:22:49] platform person walks in front of him
[1:22:53] he tells them who they
[1:22:55] are what they're doing what they were
[1:22:57] doing what happened to them and said you
[1:23:00] got a
[1:23:02] tumor it's on your left
[1:23:05] lung now that wasn't brother Rand I'm
[1:23:07] talking that was
[1:23:08] God that's right but where did that
[1:23:12] tumor go when he pronounced them healed
[1:23:14] we know that he said there were several
[1:23:16] ways of doing it let's take it to a way
[1:23:18] where that the one that remember there
[1:23:20] was one on the lady's neck and it just
[1:23:21] fell off mhm what happened to those
[1:23:24] Adams in that
[1:23:26] woman what happened to that Old
[1:23:29] Gentleman down in
[1:23:30] Mexico that couldn't see right what
[1:23:34] about the girl that didn't even have any
[1:23:39] eyeballs she wasn't it she was just
[1:23:41] blind she was born without eyeballs
[1:23:46] right and the prophet even asked her
[1:23:48] what color she
[1:23:51] wanted
[1:23:54] now that sends cold chills down our
[1:23:56] spine but we got to do something about
[1:24:00] this who was
[1:24:04] that same
[1:24:06] creator that lives in you today
[1:24:10] right amen cuz that's what's got to
[1:24:13] happen limbs are going to be restored
[1:24:15] our body is going to be changed in the
[1:24:18] atoms our atoms are going to change back
[1:24:23] Abraham and Sarah were old men and women
[1:24:27] man and
[1:24:28] woman one
[1:24:30] day they would turn back to 20 years
[1:24:33] old now God didn't take that old body
[1:24:38] and kick it over in a hole and just say
[1:24:41] no he took the atoms that they were
[1:24:43] living
[1:24:45] in the same substance that they had
[1:24:48] always lived in and he changed it back
[1:24:51] to being young right they were changed
[1:24:54] in their atoms they were
[1:24:56] translated from an old person to a young
[1:25:00] person right and they weren't born again
[1:25:02] either right
[1:25:08] right thank you
[1:25:10] Father brother random what's the
[1:25:12] translation of this Mighty powerful
[1:25:14] bride in the end
[1:25:16] time just a
[1:25:20] change the word
[1:25:23] promised before the foundation of the
[1:25:26] world the word that's in you the body
[1:25:28] will materialize around that
[1:25:31] body same thing happened to Sarah and
[1:25:34] she didn't have the word in her like you
[1:25:38] do we're supposed to be the fullness of
[1:25:42] the word she wasn't the fullness of the
[1:25:44] word
[1:25:47] now then what is this all depending
[1:25:51] upon
[1:25:53] us or
[1:25:56] God
[1:25:58] know God's already said it right God's
[1:26:02] already promised it right he's already
[1:26:05] spoke it
[1:26:07] right can you believe so we can grieve
[1:26:10] the Holy Spirit that's going to change
[1:26:12] our body we're going to grieve him away
[1:26:13] one day and we're going to die an old
[1:26:15] man and an old woman or even a young man
[1:26:18] and young woman we're not promised in
[1:26:20] yet time right right that's our whole
[1:26:24] key people brother brandham always
[1:26:27] talked about the timidness of the Holy
[1:26:31] Spirit the timidness of the Holy
[1:26:34] Ghost him being a
[1:26:38] gentleman you say well well I've heard
[1:26:40] this before well you're going to hear it
[1:26:41] again cuz it's not doing us any good
[1:26:43] right
[1:26:46] now I mean until Jesus until the fish
[1:26:50] become another fish and it was cooked
[1:26:52] right
[1:26:52] right even Jesus the flesh man didn't do
[1:26:57] that it was the Holy Ghost Inside of
[1:26:59] Amen which is the father right which is
[1:27:03] the Lord Jesus Christ amen not Jesus the
[1:27:06] flesh but Jesus the flesh man said I
[1:27:09] know nothing right until the father
[1:27:11] shows me that's right okay well guess
[1:27:14] what you and I can't either that's right
[1:27:16] but if we have the father inside of us
[1:27:19] come
[1:27:21] on
[1:27:22] he promised it right amen that
[1:27:25] somebody's going to be changed right why
[1:27:28] can't we believe it right I'm leaving
[1:27:30] that in your lap today amen cuz it's up
[1:27:33] to me and you amen it's up to us right
[1:27:36] God's already put us in the place to
[1:27:38] where we need to be listen people listen
[1:27:41] then He we're we're in the right
[1:27:44] age see brother G we would have been we
[1:27:46] would have been radicals if we would
[1:27:48] have believed this in Luther's age cuz
[1:27:49] there's no way we could attain to this
[1:27:51] right we're in the right age at the
[1:27:54] right time with the right promise amen
[1:27:57] right what are you going to do about
[1:28:02] it what are you going to do about
[1:28:12] it that's why the prophets said no
[1:28:14] Divine Healing no resurrection that
[1:28:18] Divine Healing
[1:28:20] proved even with laugh he took a man
[1:28:23] that was corrupted his cells had already
[1:28:25] started breaking
[1:28:27] down and he was blow up like an animal
[1:28:30] on the side of the road right and that
[1:28:33] man spoke one word right Lazarus
[1:28:37] right come out of there amen and what
[1:28:41] happened was God didn't go over there
[1:28:43] and go Lazarus you don't need that body
[1:28:45] no more no he took the same substance
[1:28:50] the same corruptable he said I'm going
[1:28:53] to make
[1:28:55] Incorruptible he didn't say I'm going to
[1:28:57] throw it away and get the new one he
[1:28:59] said I'm going to the Bible says from
[1:29:01] Mortal to immortality from corruption to
[1:29:05] incorruption today you're looking at
[1:29:08] corruption but inside of you dwells
[1:29:11] incorruption inside of you dwells a body
[1:29:15] that God saw before the foundation of
[1:29:17] the world and he said you know what that
[1:29:20] Gary Atkins is going to believe what I
[1:29:22] say
[1:29:25] l now any I mean you didn't have to go
[1:29:29] to school to learn
[1:29:31] that it's just having
[1:29:33] faith it's just believing cuz I think
[1:29:36] listen we're so complacent we're lay out
[1:29:39] of sins we're complacent we're supposed
[1:29:40] to be but we're not supposed to be in
[1:29:43] God complacent we're complacent in our
[1:29:46] human flesh but in God we're not
[1:29:50] supposed to be complacent I think I
[1:29:52] truly think that we're waiting on
[1:29:54] something to
[1:29:55] happen brother Gary I think we're
[1:29:57] waiting on somebody to
[1:30:01] go
[1:30:06] right when the light's been on the whole
[1:30:10] time did God's light ever go
[1:30:13] out when he said let there be light that

[1:48:01] in our members we we got to destroy that
[1:48:03] that's got to be taken away we may get
[1:48:05] into that maybe the next time we preach
[1:48:07] we may go a little deeper into what
[1:48:08] we're doing that how to cast that
[1:48:11] away because the Bible doesn't say
[1:48:13] grieve not the holy spirit of God and
[1:48:15] he'll never come back it says whereby
[1:48:18] you are sealed until the day of your
[1:48:19] Redemption but it's your choice whether
[1:48:21] you're going to go by a grave or where
[1:48:23] you going to go in a translation in a
[1:48:25] change okay and if you grieve him away
[1:48:28] he's not going to be here to change you
[1:48:30] in these atoms here he's already changed
[1:48:33] you inside you're already a new creation
[1:48:35] right created in the image of God just
[1:48:37] what he saw you before the foundation of
[1:48:39] the world but this outside God is the
[1:48:41] one we got to deal with but he gave us a
[1:48:43] word to do it with was that same quote
[1:48:45] the word promised before the foundation
[1:48:47] of the world that there's not another
[1:48:49] group coming amen there's not another
[1:48:52] Prophet coming there's not another
[1:48:54] Revelation or word coming the mystery of
[1:48:57] God will be finished in its end time
[1:49:00] through the voice of that seventh angel
[1:49:01] message well the voice he's gone but the
[1:49:03] voice is still here and the voice is in
[1:49:05] the Bride of Jesus Christ you love the
[1:49:07] Lord let's bow our heads dear heavenly
