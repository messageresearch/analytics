[43:44] brother I see him right now amen
[43:48] you should be able to see him and each
[43:50] and every one of us this morning
[43:52] if he's living in our hearts
[43:55] that was his plan
[43:57] the condensing down
[44:00] from an invisible God
[44:03] to visibility
[44:05] to tangibility
[44:07] amen I like it amen makes me feel good
[44:11] because now we know what life's purpose
[44:15] really is
[44:17] amen God bless you this morning um I'm
[44:19] just real pleased and it's a real
[44:22] pleasure and a real privilege to be in
[44:25] the house of God with each and every one
[44:26] of you
[44:27] and um I can't think of a better place
[44:31] to be unless we were all over on the
[44:34] other side
[44:35] and we were given testimonies
[44:38] of what God has done for us amen
[44:41] now of course this is
[44:43] we're here this morning to honor the
[44:45] resurrection and of course it is the
[44:47] anniversary of
[44:49] uh the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[44:53] and we just want to ask the Lord to help
[44:55] us this morning
[44:57] to be able to come to a conclusion
[45:02] uh I didn't I didn't say this before but
[45:05] it it ha it has been said in the
[45:08] previous two Services by uh comments
[45:12] that were made
[45:14] and that is that
[45:17] our purpose
[45:19] the reason why we're here
[45:23] is the conclusion
[45:25] of the whole matter
[45:27] it really is
[45:29] God is good all the time
[45:34] love him with all my heart we're just
[45:36] going to get right into the message if
[45:38] that's okay I still want you to go to
[45:40] Romans chapter 8 we're going to read
[45:42] verse 11.
[45:44] I want to start out this morning again
[45:48] on something in the Bible that took
[45:51] place on Friday night before the
[45:54] crucifixion so that we can really come
[45:57] to an understanding of what
[46:00] or who was really crucified amen amen
[46:04] the the world celebrates it as as the
[46:08] man and we of course keep the Hoffman's
[46:11] head at 33
[46:13] uh painting a copy of it there because
[46:17] the prophet of God said that in all the
[46:20] different places that he'd seen him
[46:22] that's the that's the the artist that
[46:25] captured
[46:27] uh pretty much what he looked like when
[46:29] he was a man here on Earth
[46:31] and today there is a celebration of
[46:34] course uh around the world Easter and
[46:38] and uh they they they they focus so much
[46:42] on the man that they forget about God
[46:48] we're interested in God in the man
[46:51] amen now I believe that was the god man
[46:54] yeah I believe that was the vessel that
[46:57] God used that God created that God
[46:59] brought into existence
[47:01] so that he could fulfill his plan
[47:04] to live amongst his attributes his
[47:07] children which are you and I
[47:10] we're going to find out this morning
[47:12] what really was crucified on Calvary it
[47:15] was not just a man
[47:18] amen Romans 8 11. listen careful now
[47:22] watch this scripture
[47:25] but if the spirit
[47:27] now that's a capital S but if the spirit
[47:30] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[47:34] dead
[47:36] now watch careful it doesn't say but if
[47:39] the word of him that raised up Jesus
[47:42] from the dead dwell in here it says but
[47:44] if the spirit
[47:45] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[47:48] now I thought they were one and the same
[47:52] and they are
[47:54] but the word Christ is used so that God
[47:58] can separate himself from one being into
[48:02] many
[48:03] Christ is the anointing or the anointed
[48:06] one
[48:07] or the anointed ones
[48:10] he that he raised Christ from the dead
[48:12] shall also Quicken that means make Alive
[48:15] Now activate give life to your mortal
[48:18] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[48:23] you father we thank you Lord this
[48:25] morning for your grace and your mercy I
[48:27] I pray Lord that you'd help me now
[48:30] Lord as we go through your word father
[48:34] and find the places Lord
[48:37] where you are revealing to us Lord where
[48:41] we came from Who We Are
[48:44] and our final destination Lord
[48:48] help us all I pray Lord
[48:50] let life
[48:52] activate itself in the hearts of the
[48:54] Believers Lord let this Spirit Quicken
[48:56] that body word Lord that's laying within
[49:00] us father
[49:01] so that we also Lord could not just have
[49:04] that life but become that life Lord
[49:07] that's your perfect plan this morning
[49:10] Lord
[49:12] we yield and surrender to you
[49:15] and will always be careful to give you
[49:18] all the honor and the glory and the
[49:22] praise in the precious and Wonderful
[49:24] Name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[49:28] may be seated now he did hang on Calvary
[49:32] for three hours so that you would not
[49:33] have to sit here and suffer me to preach
[49:36] three hours
[49:38] it's okay
[49:43] Paul said
[49:45] if I could just deliver five words of
[49:48] understanding just five
[49:50] I will have accomplished more than all
[49:54] of the unknown tongues that come into
[49:57] existence is that right so let me start
[50:00] out like this if you would now if it's
[50:02] all right we're we're we had Sunday
[50:04] school but I feel like we're still in
[50:06] Sunday school this morning and uh we we
[50:09] want to cover some scriptures uh I have
[50:12] right here in front of me what I'd like
[50:14] to read out of the message of the hour
[50:15] if it'll just stay illuminated for me
[50:18] um I I haven't come to the place in my
[50:22] life where I am a gadget guy but I do
[50:26] like uh the the things that make life
[50:29] easier
[50:30] um and make life better for us uh most
[50:34] of the time they become a distraction
[50:37] uh and and and and Satan is the god of
[50:40] distraction
[50:42] uh but we don't care
[50:45] it's like the automobile we use it
[50:47] because it came into existence and uh
[50:50] it's faster than walking
[50:53] it gets us to where we need to be you
[50:55] can live much further away from your
[50:57] from your place of worship or your place
[50:59] of work than you used to be able to live
[51:01] uh in times past you had to live at
[51:04] least a a horse and buggy uh distance or
[51:08] walking distance away now
[51:10] they come from the east and west
[51:12] they come from a land of far amen so I
[51:17] thought maybe I'd start out real real
[51:18] and I and I'm I'm a simple guy I love
[51:21] God's word now now we we receive God God
[51:24] delivers himself in simplicity
[51:27] is that right but God himself is
[51:30] certainly far from what we would
[51:31] consider to be simple
[51:33] he's the creator of all that exists and
[51:38] of course science tries is confounded by
[51:41] the fact that
[51:43] um they can't come to an understanding
[51:45] of of Where it All Began they are
[51:48] looking for it uh and they will never
[51:52] find it in the way that they're looking
[51:54] because now now remember something about
[51:57] science it does require a certain amount
[52:00] of Faith because they're they're they're
[52:02] they're they're employing themselves to
[52:04] look into areas that uh are without
[52:07] understanding and they're trying to
[52:10] figure out how to get there now I'll
[52:13] tell you this as I've said it before the
[52:16] word of God is how you do it but you
[52:19] still have to put your faith in the word
[52:22] of God all right so I would like for you
[52:25] to turn to begin this morning's lesson
[52:27] to Saint John chapter 18. now the more
[52:30] that I
[52:32] um uh indulge in the word of God I'd say
[52:35] study but and it does say that study
[52:38] yourself to be approved the more I
[52:40] indulge in God's word the more I find
[52:42] out that the Book of John
[52:46] is the very reason why that he was
[52:49] chosen by God to go out on the Isle of
[52:51] Patmos and be used as what we call John
[52:54] the Revelator because John's character
[52:58] and makeup um uh seemed to have a
[53:01] particular way about itself and he uh he
[53:04] by his Simplicity remember he was the um
[53:07] the disciple that always was always seen
[53:10] laying sort of in the bosom you know
[53:13] either Jesus was always hugging him to
[53:16] hang on to him or he was always hugging
[53:18] Jesus to get something from him
[53:22] it worked both ways
[53:24] you know you wouldn't think that Jesus
[53:27] needed a prop but he was he was a man
[53:29] yeah
[53:30] he was somebody uh the character of Love
[53:33] who who wanted to express and extend
[53:36] that love
[53:37] um and very few people understood that
[53:41] at the time he was here it was like
[53:43] brother Dutch saying that on Friday
[53:45] night that the the disciples and all the
[53:48] followers of Jesus and I'll say it like
[53:50] this perhaps just the 120 who made it to
[53:53] the upper room now think about Jesus was
[53:56] God In the Flesh he wasn't just a
[53:58] preacher or a prophet he was God In the
[54:01] Flesh and at the end of his life and all
[54:05] of the sermons that he preached and and
[54:07] the love that he projected and and all
[54:10] of the profound statements that he made
[54:12] there were only a hundred and twenty
[54:14] people
[54:18] who somehow caught the essence that this
[54:23] must be more than a man
[54:26] there's something more to him than just
[54:29] a fellow walking through the streets of
[54:32] Galilee
[54:34] and we probably
[54:36] ought to put our faith or what little or
[54:39] what much we have in what he said a
[54:43] hundred and twenty now I'm not good at
[54:46] guessing numbers there must be 60 80 100
[54:48] here this morning now so we're almost to
[54:51] the size of the entire class that ended
[54:56] up
[54:58] that's why that's why fear not little
[55:01] flock that's why the prophet said it
[55:03] would at the end it would just be a
[55:04] small amount of people now you know that
[55:07] I I say this to my church because we're
[55:09] not we're we're only a third of the size
[55:11] maybe of what you've got here in in
[55:13] membership and and and some and some
[55:16] ministers take those statements that
[55:19] brother Branham made like fear not
[55:20] little flock out of the scripture and
[55:22] and that it would be a small group and
[55:24] that you'd be the my own nordian and
[55:26] they try to enforce that
[55:30] do you know what I mean by that they try
[55:31] to keep the group small by rubbing
[55:34] people the wrong way
[55:37] I mean can I use a phrase uh ticking
[55:40] them off
[55:41] [Laughter]
[55:45] okay I know
[55:47] I'll bet
[55:49] yeah and people get off yeah
[55:51] see they think they're fulfilling the
[55:53] scripture by doing that I don't agree
[55:55] with that
[55:57] it's to whosoever Will
[56:00] as many or as few would come
[56:04] but I'm I'm I'm I'm seeing this morning
[56:06] something that that I I would like to
[56:09] convey to you to start and that is
[56:11] really
[56:12] really did they crucify
[56:16] a man
[56:18] or were they trying to silence the god
[56:21] in the man
[56:25] so you got Saint John 18.
[56:29] they couldn't silence the god in the man
[56:31] so they had to get rid of the man
[56:34] well what they didn't realize
[56:36] is you can't kill God
[56:41] so God said I'll show him they'll try to
[56:44] silence me
[56:45] but I'm not going to be silenced
[56:48] I'll continue to work through the same
[56:51] vessel that they thought they were going
[56:54] to silence me through I will raise it up
[56:57] from the dead I will re-enter that
[57:00] vessel and I will continue to use that
[57:03] vessel
[57:05] amen so if you got Saint John 18 lots of
[57:10] places to start from and I think maybe
[57:12] verse 28 if you're okay with that Jesus
[57:14] brought before Pilate would that be okay
[57:16] then let they Jesus from caiaphasis
[57:19] under the Hall of judgment now where
[57:21] does judgment begin
[57:23] judgment according to Saint Peter Begins
[57:25] the house of God
[57:27] and it was early
[57:29] and they themselves went not into the
[57:31] Judgment Hall do you know why because
[57:33] they didn't want to it's going to say
[57:34] this
[57:35] lest they should be defiled
[57:38] why wouldn't they want to go into the
[57:40] place where God said judgment begins
[57:43] because they were self-righteous and
[57:46] they did not think they had any
[57:48] impediments that required for them to go
[57:50] into the Judgment Hall and if they in
[57:52] fact were seen going into the Judgment
[57:54] Hall as you are seen coming into the
[57:57] house of God this morning people might
[57:59] think oh they must have something wrong
[58:01] with them
[58:06] I got lots of things wrong with me
[58:09] so I throw myself at the mercy of the
[58:12] court of God's word so that I can be
[58:16] watch now loved yeah by God Amen
[58:21] what are you saying brother judgment and
[58:24] love judgment begins at the house of God
[58:26] and the prophet of God said love is
[58:29] corrective always now correction does
[58:33] not always mean punishment see we equate
[58:37] it with punishment because when dad
[58:39] takes you to the woodshed he isn't going
[58:42] out there to sit on a stump and talk
[58:43] with you
[58:45] he's meeting out punishment
[58:51] because we're in a body
[58:53] of Flesh
[58:55] still with me
[58:58] verse 28 now
[59:00] but that they might eat the Passover 29
[59:03] pilate then went out
[59:06] unto them and said what accusation
[59:09] brings ye against this man
[59:12] they answered and said unto him if he
[59:15] were not a male effector what does that
[59:16] mean that means a bad character
[59:19] okay we would not have delivered him up
[59:23] unto thee
[59:25] then said pilate unto them take ye him
[59:28] and judge him according to your law
[59:31] the Jews therefore said unto him it is
[59:34] not lawful for us to put any man to
[59:36] death what a pack a hypocrite
[59:39] they were bringing him to a place where
[59:43] they knew that their own judgment and
[59:46] Justice would be meted out upon this man
[59:49] and that the penalty would be death
[59:52] hypocrites
[59:56] do we know anybody like that
[1:00:00] the world is in this condition right now
[1:00:07] and it's all leading up to one thing
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] amen the demise
[1:00:14] of true
[1:00:16] Christianity
[1:00:19] not Christianity the way the world wants
[1:00:22] it to be painted
[1:00:25] I just read a headline
[1:00:28] I come across my phone a week ago where
[1:00:32] the Pope
[1:00:34] who is considered by the world the head
[1:00:39] of Christianity
[1:00:41] and he had the audacity to make this
[1:00:44] statement that Ramadan
[1:00:46] and I'm not against the Muslim
[1:00:48] communities
[1:00:51] is important
[1:00:54] to Christianity
[1:00:55] no it's important
[1:00:58] to the pope
[1:01:02] because he is going to be you don't see
[1:01:05] in the in in in the world we live in
[1:01:07] right now you don't see much about the
[1:01:10] Pope well it happens to be because the
[1:01:13] man that's in the office right now is
[1:01:15] not the man that's going to do the the D
[1:01:17] no
[1:01:19] that man that they call Pope whatever
[1:01:21] his name in is not the man because God
[1:01:23] sent a prophet and that Prophet Prophet
[1:01:26] told us and I believe what that Prophet
[1:01:28] said he said that that Pope that would
[1:01:31] cause the world to go into the
[1:01:34] tribulation is coming out of the United
[1:01:36] States did you know that did you have
[1:01:38] you read that
[1:01:40] and you say well no the the the the
[1:01:42] board of the committee that's going to
[1:01:45] select and elect the next Pope or the
[1:01:47] next three popes and they got nobody on
[1:01:49] the list
[1:01:52] you don't need to be on their list
[1:01:54] he's on God's list let's keep reading
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] because I'm gonna take my time is that
[1:02:00] okay but it won't be three hours don't
[1:02:03] you worry about that
[1:02:04] all right it is not lawful for us to put
[1:02:07] any man to death verse 32 that the
[1:02:10] saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which
[1:02:13] he spakes signifying what death he
[1:02:15] should die then pilate see they were
[1:02:18] fulfilling prophecy
[1:02:19] then pilate entered into the Judgment
[1:02:21] Hall again and called Jesus and said
[1:02:24] unto him art thou the king of the Jews
[1:02:26] now watch it gets it gets a little thick
[1:02:28] right here
[1:02:29] Jesus answered him saith thou this thing
[1:02:32] of thyself or did others tell it
[1:02:38] does that ring a bell
[1:02:42] who do you say I the son of man am
[1:02:47] well some say or this and some say or
[1:02:49] that and some say you're there that's
[1:02:50] something you're the prophet something
[1:02:51] maybe but I want to know who you think
[1:02:55] who you believe what Revelation you
[1:02:58] personally have of who I am that's
[1:03:00] really what he's asking
[1:03:03] pilot
[1:03:05] okay
[1:03:07] watch now pilate answered
[1:03:10] wrong answer yeah
[1:03:13] it wasn't Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:03:15] the Living God it's am I a Jew
[1:03:20] thine own Nation
[1:03:21] and the chief priests have delivered
[1:03:23] thee unto me what hast thou done
[1:03:27] Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[1:03:29] world if my kingdom were of this world
[1:03:33] then would my servants fight
[1:03:36] that I should not be delivered to the
[1:03:38] Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:03:41] hence
[1:03:43] you mean his servants actually would
[1:03:45] have fought for him if this world was
[1:03:48] his kingdom well I can tell you that the
[1:03:50] Bible says that Michael and his angels
[1:03:52] fought against Lucifer and Satan and his
[1:03:55] angels
[1:03:57] so there is a battle going on Amen it's
[1:04:01] been going on since the beginning of
[1:04:03] creation creation is when God brought
[1:04:07] something out of nothing
[1:04:10] he brought something out of an eternal
[1:04:13] being and brought it down into time
[1:04:18] time began as soon as creation began
[1:04:23] because this God we serve and please
[1:04:25] don't try to figure this out you will go
[1:04:28] insane he had no beginning
[1:04:33] not as human beings as well he had to
[1:04:36] start somewhere
[1:04:39] that's the human being
[1:04:45] right they didn't crucify him for being
[1:04:47] a good man
[1:04:50] They Crucified him watch now
[1:04:53] for being an instrument in time
[1:05:02] that an eternal
[1:05:04] being
[1:05:06] existed in amen
[1:05:10] without beginning
[1:05:13] and without
[1:05:15] end
[1:05:16] every child of God whether you realize
[1:05:20] it or not this morning had no beginning
[1:05:25] oh no brother I was born December 11
[1:05:28] 1956 at such and such a time that's my
[1:05:30] birthday
[1:05:34] but there was something
[1:05:38] about me
[1:05:40] about you
[1:05:42] something
[1:05:44] that that that that brought you into
[1:05:48] existence we're always looking back at
[1:05:51] it the other way
[1:05:53] what brought us into existence did you
[1:05:57] know that the prophet of God said that
[1:05:59] the gene
[1:06:01] germ of Levi was activated in Abraham
[1:06:09] but he was a great grandson
[1:06:15] but the germ was activated in Abraham
[1:06:19] how
[1:06:20] how in the world were did you get here
[1:06:24] through your ancestry when we know that
[1:06:28] the germ of life that produced you came
[1:06:30] from your father it was because Abraham
[1:06:34] simply paid tithes
[1:06:37] and that tithe pain
[1:06:40] that would eventually reach the
[1:06:42] priesthood of Levi
[1:06:45] down through several Generations was the
[1:06:50] activation
[1:06:52] of The Germ of Levi now that's the
[1:06:55] natural
[1:07:00] what we want this morning is the
[1:07:03] activation of that
[1:07:05] Eternal germ
[1:07:10] you say Well it had to start somewhere
[1:07:15] the spoken word
[1:07:18] is the original seat
[1:07:23] the word seed
[1:07:26] means beginning
[1:07:29] did you know that
[1:07:30] if you read in Genesis you find out that
[1:07:33] the first thing that came into existence
[1:07:36] watch it now
[1:07:39] was not like
[1:07:41] oh brother I've got it right here in
[1:07:42] Genesis but did you read the scripture
[1:07:46] and God said
[1:07:48] let there be light
[1:07:50] so before light there was sound there
[1:07:54] was a voice there was something that
[1:07:57] came out of something and spoke
[1:08:00] and right there
[1:08:03] The Original Seed came into existence
[1:08:05] now remember something and I've probably
[1:08:07] preached this here before but it's okay
[1:08:09] some of you don't know me I'm going to
[1:08:11] give it to you the way that God has
[1:08:12] given it to me
[1:08:14] do you all believe that Adam
[1:08:17] came from God
[1:08:22] if Adam came from God
[1:08:25] then Adam was eternal
[1:08:28] Adam had
[1:08:30] watch watch watch had
[1:08:33] eternal life what do you mean he had
[1:08:35] eternal life you just told us that if
[1:08:38] you are are God's son or daughter that
[1:08:42] you never had a beginning that's right
[1:08:44] see I wanted this morning take the time
[1:08:46] to Define what was really crucified
[1:08:51] like I was beginning to say last night
[1:08:53] the real me the real you brother Luis is
[1:08:55] not the man I see it's not even the man
[1:08:58] I hear
[1:08:59] it's not the man I pay attention to
[1:09:01] there's another you in there
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:05] he's the one you go to bed at night with
[1:09:08] him he's the one you keep secrets from
[1:09:09] all your
[1:09:10] yeah he's the one who knows that whether
[1:09:12] you did right or wrong he he he's she or
[1:09:15] he it's the person
[1:09:17] okay
[1:09:19] so remember in Genesis
[1:09:21] let us make man in our image and after
[1:09:24] our likeness we are told and believed
[1:09:26] that that was a spirit man because it
[1:09:28] was made in the image of God and I
[1:09:31] believe it's in Saint John 4 24 where it
[1:09:33] says God is a spirit
[1:09:35] now you cannot kill and you cannot
[1:09:38] crucify a spirit
[1:09:40] spirits come into existence of course
[1:09:44] and can be taken out of existence but
[1:09:48] you cannot crucify a spirit
[1:09:53] wow amen
[1:09:55] so I take this piece of paper
[1:09:58] and brother Louise okay if I use you for
[1:10:00] an example you see I'm going to use
[1:10:01] brother Luis this morning as not the
[1:10:03] Fallen Adam but Adam the Son of God
[1:10:05] how's that
[1:10:07] now this piece of paper represents
[1:10:11] eternal life
[1:10:12] a portion of God like the Lake of Fire
[1:10:16] the Lake of Fire that fell on the day of
[1:10:18] Pentecost and came into the hearts of
[1:10:20] the Believers was a portion of the
[1:10:23] Eternal being of God but being
[1:10:25] represented in the Lake of Fire
[1:10:29] so that it can be seen it could be
[1:10:32] identified it could be talked about it
[1:10:35] could be written down about it could be
[1:10:37] conveyed but how are you going to convey
[1:10:39] a spirit here
[1:10:40] I'm gonna convey the spirit right now
[1:10:42] that's God's spirit right there
[1:10:44] now Adam had
[1:10:49] eternal life
[1:10:51] and that eternal life was based on one
[1:10:53] premise and that premise was keep my
[1:10:57] word amen so therefore if you have to
[1:11:00] keep his word in order to maintain
[1:11:03] eternal life his word
[1:11:06] and his life are one
[1:11:09] now when Adam chose
[1:11:12] to save a part of himself which we call
[1:11:18] Eve he had to make a decision
[1:11:21] and that decision was
[1:11:24] do I give up
[1:11:26] what God has given me
[1:11:30] to save her or do I let her go
[1:11:40] Adam
[1:11:42] being
[1:11:43] a son of God
[1:11:45] Adam having a portion of God
[1:11:52] had a revelation
[1:11:56] what was his revelation
[1:12:00] I'm going to lay my life down
[1:12:04] because I have a representation that's
[1:12:07] going to raise it up again may I have
[1:12:10] that brother Louise I know you don't
[1:12:12] want to give up your eternal life but
[1:12:14] it's only temporary
[1:12:17] it only it lasted less than three days
[1:12:21] when God decided
[1:12:23] I'm gonna I'm gonna make myself the
[1:12:27] perfect example now brother Bradham said
[1:12:29] that when Adam partook of the forbidden
[1:12:34] fruit to save Eve's life it was Christ
[1:12:42] so the same spirit that raised Jesus
[1:12:46] from the dead
[1:12:48] if it dwell in you
[1:12:52] it will it and and you don't realize
[1:12:54] that brothers and sisters maybe but the
[1:12:56] preaching of the word is the quickening
[1:13:00] power not because it's the letter on the
[1:13:04] page not because it's a repeating of
[1:13:07] what someone else said but because it's
[1:13:10] Life coming through a vessel and then
[1:13:14] conveying a word from God that activates
[1:13:17] the seed inside of you and say I see
[1:13:20] that that's it that's life
[1:13:23] I didn't know when I was lost and undone
[1:13:26] in the world brother Donnie that there
[1:13:27] was something inside of me that was
[1:13:29] crying and groaning and wishing for
[1:13:32] something better
[1:13:35] but I would sit down with a can of beer
[1:13:38] and a and a marijuana cigarette and sit
[1:13:42] there and say
[1:13:44] it
[1:13:46] I'd had friends that did the same thing
[1:13:49] and I don't remember any of them sitting
[1:13:51] down and saying is this it
[1:13:58] what was it in me what was it in you
[1:14:06] let me finish the scripture
[1:14:08] let me get to a point
[1:14:11] you still here
[1:14:15] Jesus answered my kingdom verse 36 is
[1:14:18] not of this world if my kingdom were of
[1:14:20] this world then when my servant servants
[1:14:23] fight that I should not be delivered to
[1:14:24] the Jews but now is my kingdom not from
[1:14:27] hence pilate therefore said unto him are
[1:14:30] thou a king then
[1:14:33] jeez I don't see how he got that
[1:14:35] question out of that answer all right
[1:14:38] thou a king then yeah yeah Jesus
[1:14:40] answered thou sayest that I am a king
[1:14:45] listen you mean by a question
[1:14:49] just the very fact Jesus knew just the
[1:14:52] very fact that this was permeating
[1:14:54] inside of Pilate
[1:15:01] our Thou King phallus said no I didn't
[1:15:04] say that I asked you yeah
[1:15:06] the question
[1:15:07] revealed to Jesus that pilate knew
[1:15:13] but he was unwilling to admit
[1:15:16] because pilate also was a man of
[1:15:19] authority
[1:15:21] all right but I want to get down to this
[1:15:23] part
[1:15:24] thou sayest that I am a king to this end
[1:15:26] was I born
[1:15:28] and for this cause came I into the world
[1:15:33] that I should bear witness unto the
[1:15:37] truth amen
[1:15:39] amen everyone that is of the truth watch
[1:15:41] now Hearth my voice
[1:15:45] why because the spoken word is the
[1:15:49] original seed and the Original Seed is
[1:15:52] truth
[1:15:54] and pilate goes on and says what is
[1:15:57] truth
[1:15:59] right
[1:16:01] did you realize right there indicates to
[1:16:04] us they were crucifying the truth
[1:16:08] because they didn't want the truth
[1:16:12] I looked up the word truth and it says
[1:16:16] actuality fact Fidelity which is similar
[1:16:21] to Faith or faithful
[1:16:24] and
[1:16:28] constancy like constant comes from the
[1:16:31] root of true the word true
[1:16:34] and true means ideal essential
[1:16:38] consistent typical steadfast loyal
[1:16:41] honest just legitimate rightful and
[1:16:44] accurate so really really the confusion
[1:16:47] for for pilate was what is essential
[1:16:52] what is ideal see he's asking what is
[1:16:54] truth what is consistent yeah what is
[1:16:58] typical
[1:16:59] what is steadfast what is loyal
[1:17:02] see these are the the definitions we'd
[1:17:05] say synonyms but the definitions of
[1:17:06] Truth and he says what is truth
[1:17:10] wow he didn't have a clue
[1:17:15] what is honest what is just
[1:17:19] what is legitimate what is rightful
[1:17:21] what is accurate do you know where the
[1:17:25] word true came from now this is not a
[1:17:28] pun or a play on words but the very root
[1:17:34] of the word true
[1:17:37] comes from the word tree
[1:17:40] that's what my dictionary said same one
[1:17:43] you all can use the Merriam-Webster yeah
[1:17:46] that's right and I saw that and I said
[1:17:48] oh
[1:17:50] brother Donnie
[1:17:52] I'm going to tell you what came to me
[1:17:56] yeah two trees
[1:18:01] what looks like two truths
[1:18:06] Jesus said if you're of the truth you
[1:18:08] will hear me he says what is truth I
[1:18:11] don't understand
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:15] that's because
[1:18:17] of the two trees
[1:18:20] he that heareth my word he that
[1:18:23] believeth truth that would be those that
[1:18:27] came from the Tree of Life
[1:18:30] those that are asking the question like
[1:18:33] pilate would have have to emanate it
[1:18:36] from the Tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:18:39] Evil you see how how how there's a
[1:18:42] contrast now there's a contrast
[1:18:46] prophet of God speaks about that
[1:18:48] without contrast
[1:18:52] if there wasn't a a bad one we wouldn't
[1:18:54] know what a good one was
[1:18:58] a amount he uses the word bad woman did
[1:19:00] you know that
[1:19:03] what's the woman a type of
[1:19:05] amen thank you so if there wasn't a bad
[1:19:07] one yeah we wouldn't know what a good
[1:19:10] one was
[1:19:11] how do we identify what a good church is
[1:19:15] depends on where you came from
[1:19:22] very simple
[1:19:24] so let me go here with you what is truth
[1:19:29] well let's just get back to the basics
[1:19:33] God is a spirit now God g-o-d the word
[1:19:37] god is an object of worship
[1:19:39] the the word god listen now it's not
[1:19:43] eternal
[1:19:44] the word geod
[1:19:47] ude the spirit that brought that word
[1:19:50] into existence is eternal
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:56] but he needed to to come out of an
[1:19:59] invisible world that nobody could see
[1:20:01] right
[1:20:02] right that nobody could comprehend
[1:20:06] and begin to condescend down in such a
[1:20:09] way where the plan that he had so he
[1:20:13] could fellowship with his children his
[1:20:16] attributes could come about
[1:20:18] believe that
[1:20:20] that's what they crucified
[1:20:23] They Crucified the idea of God wanting
[1:20:29] to fellowship with himself through his
[1:20:32] attributes they thought they could
[1:20:34] silence it
[1:20:36] they thought they could bring it to an
[1:20:38] end but they did not comprehend the
[1:20:41] truth
[1:20:44] if they would have just gone back before
[1:20:47] before Pilate would have brought Jesus
[1:20:50] he should have said
[1:20:52] um uh we're gonna we're gonna put him on
[1:20:54] a retainer uh I'm gonna let him out on
[1:20:56] bail
[1:20:57] I'm going to let him out on his or his
[1:21:00] own recognets and then I'm going to do a
[1:21:02] little background check here and then
[1:21:04] I'm gonna then I'll make a judgment
[1:21:06] based upon that and if he would have
[1:21:09] just went back into the Book of John
[1:21:10] just a little further Jesus said I am
[1:21:12] the way
[1:21:14] the truth he wouldn't have had to have
[1:21:16] asked the question
[1:21:19] what is truth
[1:21:20] he
[1:21:22] was truth
[1:21:24] he was the way he was life and if he
[1:21:28] would have just read that simple
[1:21:29] scripture pilate and came to a
[1:21:32] revelation of what was being conveyed he
[1:21:35] would have not crucified him and
[1:21:36] delivered him up
[1:21:38] why because his life you can't kill that
[1:21:45] amen so brothers and sisters there's
[1:21:46] something inside of us this morning if
[1:21:48] we've been born again of the word seed
[1:21:50] of God and the spirit of God has come
[1:21:53] down on that and activated there's
[1:21:55] something in us that says he in me is
[1:22:00] the power to lay this life down now what
[1:22:04] is eternal life what is it it's living
[1:22:07] for others and in order to live for
[1:22:10] others something's got to die what's
[1:22:13] Gotta Die you and me gonna die to live
[1:22:16] for others
[1:22:17] oh no brother I want to keep it for
[1:22:20] myself or to myself I don't have enough
[1:22:23] to give out then you're from the wrong
[1:22:26] side of the tracks
[1:22:29] because this is life
[1:22:34] and I'm not gonna make anybody in here
[1:22:36] feel bad this morning but I want you to
[1:22:38] ponder this
[1:22:40] do you have eternal life
[1:22:42] do you live for others I'm not talking
[1:22:45] about a grandma all living for her
[1:22:47] granddaughter
[1:22:49] that's easy yeah
[1:22:52] yeah I'm talking about you and I doing
[1:22:56] things outside of our normal circle like
[1:23:00] I have need to go to Samaria well what
[1:23:03] are you going to Samaria for we need
[1:23:04] groceries we're going to go shopping
[1:23:06] that's really what the disciples are
[1:23:07] going to do go buy food
[1:23:09] he said you go get the natural food I
[1:23:12] got some other groceries I got to
[1:23:14] deliver
[1:23:15] I'm gonna take it down to the well
[1:23:17] because I know by being God manifest In
[1:23:22] the Flesh that there is one of mine over
[1:23:26] at the well and she's pondering her life
[1:23:29] right now
[1:23:30] yeah
[1:23:32] you've had five
[1:23:34] and the one you're with is not yours how
[1:23:36] in the world did that guy know that how
[1:23:39] did he know that I was sitting on my
[1:23:40] front porch yeah
[1:23:43] pondering my own life amen
[1:23:49] there's more to us than meets the eye I
[1:23:51] can tell you that right now
[1:23:53] right
[1:23:54] and I'm preaching to you on Easter wait
[1:23:56] until I get to the quote
[1:23:59] but I want to just paint this picture so
[1:24:02] so easy
[1:24:04] it's not one of those pictures you know
[1:24:06] that's of the aspen trees like they do
[1:24:09] where I live and then you gotta study it
[1:24:11] real close oh there's a deer in there
[1:24:13] there's an elk in there there's a
[1:24:15] mountain lion and I never saw that
[1:24:16] before no this is plain yeah in plane
[1:24:21] so we realized that God's plan required
[1:24:25] him to begin to come down out of the
[1:24:27] invisible
[1:24:29] eternity that he dwelt in and he had to
[1:24:32] Institute time which by the way is our
[1:24:34] worst enemy
[1:24:38] it's fighting some of you right now man
[1:24:40] he's been up there for 20 minutes isn't
[1:24:42] it
[1:24:44] well I don't have a lifesaver and I
[1:24:47] don't have a button
[1:24:51] but I love God's word
[1:24:54] it changed my life
[1:24:59] changed my life
[1:25:01] I didn't realize that there was a spirit
[1:25:04] of God until I listened to the word of
[1:25:08] God now remember something about a seed
[1:25:10] here I'll pick this piece of paper I
[1:25:12] usually bring a big old avocado seed to
[1:25:14] the pulpit and the reason I do is
[1:25:15] because it's a large seed and you could
[1:25:17] see it and I like avocados so I ate
[1:25:19] whatever it
[1:25:20] was covering it okay
[1:25:23] okay that's why he said eat my flesh and
[1:25:25] drink my blood
[1:25:27] or you have no life in you right but
[1:25:29] I'll use this piece of paper
[1:25:31] every seed listen careful
[1:25:35] and we know that the spoken word is the
[1:25:37] Original Seed so I want to get every
[1:25:39] seed has a life in it and it is the life
[1:25:46] of the seed
[1:25:48] but without the spirit
[1:25:51] it just lays dormant it it's got life in
[1:25:55] it it's got its own life in it
[1:25:57] but it lays the dormant unless it comes
[1:26:01] in contact with the way God ordained it
[1:26:06] to Spring forth
[1:26:09] that's why Romans 8 says if the spirit
[1:26:13] be in you that was the spirit that was
[1:26:16] in the man we know as Jesus who said I
[1:26:19] have the power to lay my life down for
[1:26:21] this cause came I end of the world you
[1:26:24] tear this Temple down and in three days
[1:26:27] do you know when they were mocking and
[1:26:29] scourging and whipping and and kicking
[1:26:31] and spitting on and pulling as a beard
[1:26:33] that we're trying to destroy the temple
[1:26:35] amen we see Jesus on these pictures in
[1:26:39] the cross and and of course he's pretty
[1:26:41] Haggard looking them the Mel Gibson
[1:26:42] thing that the brother talked about The
[1:26:44] Passion of the Christ I mean that's
[1:26:46] pretty horrible but the prophet of God
[1:26:48] told us you couldn't recognize him as a
[1:26:51] man even his ribs were sticking out of
[1:26:53] his skin
[1:26:56] and I know what that does to people they
[1:26:58] go oh my goodness that man gave his life
[1:27:00] but did you realize who
[1:27:03] was doing it yeah
[1:27:06] yeah come on bro you say it was God
[1:27:09] oh the spirit of God left Jesus in The
[1:27:13] Garden of Gethsemane because the spirit
[1:27:16] of God can not die
[1:27:19] it's Eternal it had no beginning it'll
[1:27:23] have no end so it had to remove itself
[1:27:27] from that body and that body was a human
[1:27:31] body in such a way where when he got to
[1:27:34] the Garden of Gethsemane his brother
[1:27:36] Dutch said and he saw what was coming
[1:27:42] he jumped and ran
[1:27:46] he gave up
[1:27:47] he said I can't do it
[1:27:51] he realized that the task
[1:27:53] was nearly insurmountable
[1:27:56] I don't think I can do it
[1:27:59] I want to do it
[1:28:01] but I don't think
[1:28:04] I can do it
[1:28:06] but something way down
[1:28:09] yeah where did that come from the spirit
[1:28:11] of God it already
[1:28:13] yeah where did that come from where did
[1:28:16] that thing way down on the inside of
[1:28:19] that man rise up and say yeah
[1:28:22] the lord giveth
[1:28:25] and the lord taketh away
[1:28:27] bless it be the name of the Lord
[1:28:30] not my will
[1:28:33] come on now
[1:28:34] not my will we know the prophet of God
[1:28:37] pointed out to us and it's obvious that
[1:28:40] the death of Calvary happened in
[1:28:43] Gethsemane the actual event itself on
[1:28:46] the cross was just the follow-through
[1:28:49] the repercussions of the battle
[1:28:53] In The Garden of Gethsemane which all of
[1:28:55] us battle amen
[1:28:58] should I help them or should I not
[1:29:01] do I care or don't I care does this
[1:29:04] matter or does this not matter and so on
[1:29:07] and so on and so on brothers and sisters
[1:29:09] but God has made a way for you and I
[1:29:15] to come through it all yeah
[1:29:19] don't let this shock you now but it's
[1:29:20] because
[1:29:22] he knew you
[1:29:26] I see the ministry from time to time
[1:29:30] began to discuss in different forums and
[1:29:33] platforms uh whether there was anything
[1:29:37] in you or not
[1:29:40] and I we have quotes to go both ways
[1:29:43] but what it boils down to is here's
[1:29:46] what's in you but you don't know it's in
[1:29:49] you because you're looking for something
[1:29:52] tangible you're looking for something
[1:29:55] through the telescope the microscope
[1:29:56] you're looking for something that you
[1:29:58] can get a hold of and you can't touch
[1:30:01] for knowledge
[1:30:04] you can't touch it if God saw you that's
[1:30:09] what he's calling to come to him you
[1:30:13] don't need that tangibility in you you
[1:30:15] don't need that substance what you need
[1:30:17] is faith
[1:30:20] faith is the activator yes
[1:30:25] brother Brandon said God when he said
[1:30:27] let there be light had to believe his
[1:30:30] own word he had to place faith in it why
[1:30:32] because he instituted the law of faith
[1:30:35] that's the reason why brother Brown said
[1:30:37] many a streetwalker could come to the
[1:30:39] prayer line because of a type of faith
[1:30:41] that they had and receive their healing
[1:30:43] and a good Sanctified godly woman would
[1:30:46] come to the line and get nothing
[1:30:51] it's powerful yeah how is that possible
[1:30:54] all things are possible
[1:30:59] see
[1:31:01] You've Got to Believe
[1:31:04] you've got to put all your confidence
[1:31:06] I'm going to say it like this you've got
[1:31:09] to pour all your life into what you
[1:31:13] believe and it matters what you believe
[1:31:18] amen
[1:31:20] so you want to put it in God's word amen
[1:31:23] amen because God's word
[1:31:26] has God's life in it but it doesn't stop
[1:31:31] there that's why I reiterated to you in
[1:31:35] Romans but if the spirit
[1:31:39] and brothers and sisters a lot of us
[1:31:41] walk around through life
[1:31:43] with the seed of God in us but never
[1:31:45] allow it to be activated oh don't worry
[1:31:48] I'm not preaching to you Pentecost
[1:31:51] but I am preaching to you that that
[1:31:54] Malachi 4 says he'll turn the hearts of
[1:31:58] the children back to the Pentecostal
[1:32:01] fathers not the denomination
[1:32:04] but to the activation of the life
[1:32:08] that's the key now the seed that was
[1:32:12] meant for the people of the day we live
[1:32:14] in was the seed that God saved remember
[1:32:18] that the very first seed of any plant or
[1:32:22] tree I'll use the apple tree is that all
[1:32:25] right the very first seed that God ever
[1:32:29] planted of the first Apple Tree had
[1:32:32] every Apple Tree in it after that it had
[1:32:36] every Apple had ever seen it ever leave
[1:32:38] it at every lamb and every root
[1:32:40] you catch that we can see that what
[1:32:43] about when God plants a seed
[1:32:45] when God planted the seed that was him
[1:32:50] it had every son and daughter that would
[1:32:54] ever come
[1:32:56] that's why he said the first shall be
[1:32:59] last and the last shall be first because
[1:33:02] the first seed that was planted had all
[1:33:06] of God in it after that it began to
[1:33:10] Blossom and Sprout with the life of God
[1:33:12] but the original seat
[1:33:15] he swear it all came from and we are
[1:33:18] taught by the prophet that in the day
[1:33:20] you and I live in we're back
[1:33:25] first shall be last
[1:33:26] and the last
[1:33:28] shall be first
[1:33:30] where did God keep this in Christ is the
[1:33:33] mystery of God revealed he kept it in
[1:33:36] the back part
[1:33:38] of his mind
[1:33:39] Moses didn't realize that at the time
[1:33:41] because he didn't live in the time you
[1:33:43] and I did but when he wanted to see God
[1:33:45] and God showed him his back
[1:33:47] God was showing him
[1:33:49] the beginning
[1:33:52] that seed was there Moses was was in God
[1:33:57] at the beginning but Moses in time was
[1:33:59] not produced at the beginning do you
[1:34:02] realize that the Fall In the Garden of
[1:34:04] Eden and what Satan did through the
[1:34:07] serpent
[1:34:08] was Satan believing
[1:34:11] in himself so much that he could plant
[1:34:14] an alternative seed mix it
[1:34:21] and come forth
[1:34:23] listen now as Christ
[1:34:28] where did he where did he miss it
[1:34:30] the germ
[1:34:32] come from the mail
[1:34:34] the field
[1:34:36] is the church
[1:34:38] that's why when the prophet of God came
[1:34:41] in the 20th century his battle
[1:34:45] was to get the field
[1:34:47] to see
[1:34:51] stop that seed stop that seed stop that
[1:34:52] seed stop saying don't take that don't
[1:34:54] take that don't take that here
[1:34:56] 's the original scene take this take
[1:34:58] this
[1:34:59] amen
[1:35:01] and we realize Through the Ages that
[1:35:03] many many many people and again brother
[1:35:07] Bradham I can quote you he said they're
[1:35:09] not lost
[1:35:10] don't say they're lost goes back to
[1:35:13] Martin Luther and John Wesley and so
[1:35:14] forth they're not lost he said they
[1:35:16] played their part but there is a time
[1:35:19] where there is a people who will not
[1:35:22] accept anything but all the word of God
[1:35:27] they will cast down their reasoning they
[1:35:29] will cast down everybody else's
[1:35:30] reasoning and and it doesn't watch now
[1:35:33] it doesn't make you an isolationist
[1:35:38] that's what a lot of people end up
[1:35:40] though all by themselves out there on
[1:35:43] that island you've heard me say it
[1:35:44] before you know the guy that was
[1:35:45] Shipwrecked and they finally came to
[1:35:48] rescue him years and years later
[1:35:51] one guy on the island I know it
[1:35:54] I use the one about get your own dirt
[1:35:59] y they finally show up years later
[1:36:03] and there's three huts
[1:36:06] three little huts on the island hey I
[1:36:08] thought you were Shipwrecked by yourself
[1:36:09] well I am
[1:36:11] what's that over there he says that's
[1:36:12] where I live
[1:36:13] he says what's that he says that's my
[1:36:16] church oh what's this other little Hut
[1:36:18] that was my church before I built that
[1:36:19] one
[1:36:22] it's my former church he didn't even get
[1:36:24] along with himself
[1:36:25] and that's what some of the problem is
[1:36:27] we just don't get along with ourselves
[1:36:29] that's why the word of God through the
[1:36:31] message of the hour is to inform you is
[1:36:34] to reveal to you is to give you a
[1:36:36] personal revelation of Who You Are by
[1:36:40] where you came from because once you
[1:36:43] know and are convinced that you came
[1:36:45] from God then you do have the power amen
[1:36:49] through that Revelation to lay your life
[1:36:53] down now we're thinking of the tomb of
[1:36:55] death of Calvary of crucifixion oh he
[1:36:58] said take up your cross
[1:37:01] he didn't say take up your cross and
[1:37:03] nail yourself to it and die like me he
[1:37:06] said take up your cross
[1:37:08] follow me
[1:37:11] ain't God good
[1:37:15] so we realized that
[1:37:18] I'm watching the clock say
[1:37:22] I don't know
[1:37:26] leave it Laura
[1:37:29] I'll finish my thoughts that I have on
[1:37:31] this page only only got one one and a
[1:37:33] half pages of notes
[1:37:36] but I like inspiration yeah
[1:37:40] I like notes
[1:37:42] I
[1:37:43] admire the men that can get them gadgets
[1:37:46] and they can just and they got their
[1:37:48] message down there and they scroll up
[1:37:50] and they can see that and they but
[1:37:52] that's not me
[1:37:56] God is the spirit
[1:37:58] is that right
[1:38:00] now if we would turn to our Bibles
[1:38:03] everybody knows these scriptures I'm
[1:38:05] going to read them I know the brothers
[1:38:06] put them up on the board Saint John
[1:38:08] chapter 1 verse one
[1:38:11] let's start there and we're and really I
[1:38:14] I you know the title of my message is
[1:38:17] resurrection by representation well
[1:38:20] let's see what really was crucified and
[1:38:22] what really resurrected of course the
[1:38:24] man rose from the dead but that man was
[1:38:28] busy working while everybody thought he
[1:38:31] was dead
[1:38:33] as I mentioned yesterday it was the
[1:38:35] seventh day
[1:38:37] that he was doing that work and
[1:38:40] denominationalism and the thought of
[1:38:42] denomination and how many knows what the
[1:38:44] word denomination means really do you
[1:38:46] really know
[1:38:47] I'm going to tell you what it means now
[1:38:49] by the way did you carry anymore who's
[1:38:51] got a dollar a five dollar bill a tenant
[1:38:53] give me a hundred not
[1:38:55] that would be the wrong kind of
[1:38:56] evangelism if somebody's got a bill in
[1:38:59] their pocket thank you brother that's
[1:39:01] all I need to see he's a good man he
[1:39:03] gave me one and that's because George
[1:39:04] Washington's on it
[1:39:06] now now the word denomination brother
[1:39:09] now how many knows the the older folk in
[1:39:12] here are going to know this some of you
[1:39:13] young people are going to learn some
[1:39:14] today this is a denominational note did
[1:39:16] you know that's what this is called
[1:39:18] now it has nothing to do with church
[1:39:21] but it is called a denominational note
[1:39:23] what is the denomination of this note we
[1:39:26] say it's one dollar
[1:39:28] but where they got the word denomination
[1:39:31] from if you break it down in Latin is
[1:39:34] the value of a name so they put George
[1:39:36] Washington worth a buck right
[1:39:39] you say wait a minute he was the first
[1:39:41] president he was the next race number
[1:39:42] one he was the first president he was
[1:39:44] probably one of the greatest presidents
[1:39:46] but they knew that more people would
[1:39:48] have the one dollar bills than Andrew
[1:39:50] Jackson
[1:39:53] the common people
[1:39:55] would be more likely to have this note
[1:39:59] than the 50. or the hundred especially
[1:40:02] back in time when that was like a
[1:40:04] million dollars
[1:40:07] this is a one dollar denominational note
[1:40:09] so what it means is the value
[1:40:13] to the Federal Reserve of George
[1:40:17] Washington is a buck
[1:40:21] you know why I said all that
[1:40:23] because it's the value of a name
[1:40:27] where did denominations start from they
[1:40:30] start from man who puts a lot of
[1:40:33] emphasis and and and a lot of authority
[1:40:37] and a lot of respect and so forth on
[1:40:40] somebody and that somebody can die
[1:40:44] that don't stop the spirit
[1:40:46] Martin Luther died and boom the Lutheran
[1:40:48] Church come up John Wesley died in the
[1:40:51] Methodist Church come up
[1:40:52] uh brother Seymour
[1:40:58] from the Azusa Street Mission died that
[1:41:00] didn't stop the Pentecostal movement
[1:41:03] but what is the difference between a
[1:41:07] denomination and true Eagle Christianity
[1:41:11] it's based on one man
[1:41:15] but that one man is not conveying his
[1:41:18] thoughts he's conveying the thoughts of
[1:41:20] God and that's what they crucified they
[1:41:24] thought they could silence God's voice
[1:41:26] look at the world we live in why do you
[1:41:29] think there's coming an attack on
[1:41:31] Christianity because they know Satan
[1:41:35] knows they have no clue they're just
[1:41:36] minions they're just being used by Satan
[1:41:40] to be raised up in a certain thought
[1:41:42] process to stop Christianity because
[1:41:44] Christianity is the only hope yeah
[1:41:48] not denominational Christianity true
[1:41:51] Eagle Christianity
[1:41:54] because it emanated from a source they
[1:41:59] cannot touch
[1:42:01] right only you and I as believers who
[1:42:03] are willing to submit and subject
[1:42:05] ourselves to it have access
[1:42:08] amen right
[1:42:10] that's right
[1:42:11] I'll tell you what I I could I could
[1:42:14] dance a little bit if I didn't have an
[1:42:16] artificial knee I'd get crazy
[1:42:22] but I don't want another one
[1:42:24] so I'm afraid
[1:42:26] that I'll I'll have to get another one
[1:42:28] yeah
[1:42:29] have you ever seen uh
[1:42:33] one of them their YouTube videos of them
[1:42:35] replacing a knee
[1:42:38] they jump on top of you with a
[1:42:40] sledgehammer and a chisel
[1:42:42] and a ranch and they separate the lower
[1:42:44] leg from the upper one they drill holes
[1:42:46] in your bone marrow and they take
[1:42:47] something that looks like a rebar
[1:42:49] brother Donnie and they glue it down in
[1:42:51] there the bottom and the top and then
[1:42:52] they connect this stainless steel
[1:42:54] ball to it
[1:42:58] I was in more pain watching
[1:43:01] than I was participating
[1:43:03] and sometimes that's the way it is think
[1:43:05] about it our mind goes to a certain
[1:43:07] place oh I I can't do it
[1:43:11] if it's possible let this cup pass from
[1:43:13] me
[1:43:15] that was way more painful now you say
[1:43:18] well no Calvary was
[1:43:19] in the man
[1:43:21] it was way more difficult once he became
[1:43:24] satisfied that that was his portion of
[1:43:29] of God's work for him he said
[1:43:33] thy will yeah
[1:43:34] let thy will be done amen amen but
[1:43:37] remember something
[1:43:40] the word God g-o-d and object of worship
[1:43:42] was brought into existence because
[1:43:44] before that we are no he was known as
[1:43:46] what we call Elohim the self-existent
[1:43:50] one a lot of folks and a lot of churches
[1:43:52] and a lot of Ministries try to maintain
[1:43:54] Elohim
[1:43:56] it's us for nobody that's not the way
[1:43:59] God operates he says it's me and
[1:44:01] everybody
[1:44:03] it's us let us make man
[1:44:07] you know I'm not going to read it to you
[1:44:09] but you go a little bit below what is
[1:44:10] truth and you'll find out that pilate
[1:44:12] said behold
[1:44:14] the man
[1:44:15] that was the man that was produced
[1:44:20] by Genesis 1 26 and 7.
[1:44:24] Hallelujah that's right yes
[1:44:32] God was a thought
[1:44:36] can you see my thoughts
[1:44:40] I can't see yours and
[1:44:42] I can tell by the expression on some of
[1:44:44] your faces
[1:44:46] some good something different some bad
[1:44:49] but I don't know exactly what you're
[1:44:51] thinking you don't know exactly what I'm
[1:44:54] thinking so if I want you to understand
[1:44:59] or be able to comprehend and absorb and
[1:45:02] digest my thought that you cannot see I
[1:45:06] must speak
[1:45:07] now if I'm a liar
[1:45:10] my thoughts are lies
[1:45:17] if I'm a sinner my thoughts are sinful
[1:45:24] but if you've been born again
[1:45:27] power of transformation begins to what
[1:45:30] by the renewing of the Mind amen it
[1:45:35] begins to change somehow it begins to
[1:45:38] change the way you think now it's not in
[1:45:40] an instant the way you and I it's a
[1:45:42] lifetime of change it was Abraham
[1:45:45] walking for 25 years Abraham by proof of
[1:45:51] Ishmael had what it took in his body to
[1:45:56] produce the promise but his church had
[1:45:59] not quite got there yet amen
[1:46:08] thank you
[1:46:09] at what point
[1:46:14] did Abraham's Church
[1:46:16] Sarah
[1:46:19] come to the conclusion that she could
[1:46:23] fulfill the promise
[1:46:26] she was changed in such a way
[1:46:30] or the pharaoh
[1:46:32] said who who
[1:46:34] She's mine yeah
[1:46:37] she hadn't looked in a mirror
[1:46:40] until she got into Pharaoh's Palace
[1:46:43] because they had mirrors you know
[1:46:46] and she looked and said whoa who is that
[1:46:52] this is the person
[1:46:54] that he wants
[1:46:56] for his wife
[1:46:58] Abraham get me out of here I've got what
[1:47:01] it takes now to produce the promised son
[1:47:09] and God intervened
[1:47:12] don't touch her
[1:47:14] because if you even try
[1:47:17] you die
[1:47:20] God see is always he's in I like I I
[1:47:23] sister Regina I bet you could sing this
[1:47:25] for me he's an on time God yes he is
[1:47:30] he's an on-time God yes he is job said
[1:47:34] it might not be rare when you want him
[1:47:37] to but he's always right on time
[1:47:40] because he's an on-time God that's why
[1:47:43] we're here this morning did you realize
[1:47:45] that you are fulfilling the on time God
[1:47:50] so he as a thought as a spirit
[1:47:54] as the great mind we call him because we
[1:47:56] don't really know how else to express or
[1:47:59] explain it he began to speak and he said
[1:48:02] let there be and let there be and let
[1:48:04] there be now guess what the spoken word
[1:48:06] really is
[1:48:08] it is his son
[1:48:11] see we think of the human body as his
[1:48:15] son but if you'll go to First the
[1:48:17] Epistle of First John 5 what does it say
[1:48:20] there
[1:48:21] first John 1 says in the beginning was
[1:48:23] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:48:27] the Word was God now in verse 14 it says
[1:48:29] and the Word was made flesh so they
[1:48:31] thought they were crucifying the word
[1:48:33] Satan was motivating them to stop God
[1:48:37] come on
[1:48:39] you ain't gonna stop God you ain't gonna
[1:48:42] stop God's word
[1:48:46] but the carrier
[1:48:48] the conduit the vehicle
[1:48:52] the one that God chose
[1:48:57] the conduit he chose in the 20th century
[1:48:59] was killed in a car accident
[1:49:03] Satan said
[1:49:05] I stopped
[1:49:08] on Calvary I stopped it
[1:49:12] he didn't stop nothing
[1:49:14] he just motivated he didn't realize that
[1:49:16] he just motivated
[1:49:19] he inspired here's what he did watch as
[1:49:22] I mentioned to you about Levi
[1:49:24] being activated
[1:49:27] in the loins of Abraham when that car
[1:49:29] accident took place what Satan didn't
[1:49:31] know was there was an activation of Life
[1:49:33] why because a corn of wheat abideth
[1:49:35] alone unless it falls into the ground it
[1:49:37] dies
[1:49:39] and if it dies and there is life in it
[1:49:42] it will bring forth
[1:49:44] after it's kind
[1:49:49] of oh I see I got a little Kickback
[1:49:51] right there oh well he's trying to be
[1:49:53] the prophet oh no I'm not trying to be
[1:49:55] the prophet
[1:49:59] I'm not trying to be Jesus Christ
[1:50:01] he lives in here
[1:50:04] I'll tell you what we are did you hear
[1:50:06] me say it yesterday we are the burning
[1:50:09] bush
[1:50:12] did you realize that and as the fire of
[1:50:15] God Burns in your heart perhaps there
[1:50:17] will be a Moses out there somewhere that
[1:50:19] will turn aside and say
[1:50:21] what do you got
[1:50:23] who did you say you were
[1:50:25] what do you believe
[1:50:27] I believe he's an on-time God
[1:50:31] I believe he's good all the time
[1:50:34] I believe he saves by grace
[1:50:37] listen now here's the part they leave
[1:50:39] out through faith
[1:50:42] that's not the end of that scripture you
[1:50:45] are saved by grace through faith you
[1:50:48] must have a revelation of what the grace
[1:50:50] of God truly is and the grace of God is
[1:50:53] unmerited favor how did we end up then
[1:50:56] brother Louise in the condition of
[1:50:58] Salvation if it was unmerited favor in
[1:51:00] our neighbor who's ten times better than
[1:51:02] we are doesn't it it's because of
[1:51:04] foreknowledge see four knowledge is
[1:51:06] still here that's why it's looking
[1:51:08] forward that sees the past not looking
[1:51:12] back brother bread instead of frog looks
[1:51:14] back
[1:51:17] man
[1:51:19] and when a frog looks back he sees a try
[1:51:21] in being
[1:51:24] when a child of God looks forward
[1:51:27] they see God
[1:51:30] you know I believe this now it's not a
[1:51:32] Doctrine
[1:51:33] it's just the way I feel that this new
[1:51:36] telescope the James Webb super telescope
[1:51:38] is sent out there one million miles one
[1:51:41] million miles out in space and it's
[1:51:43] static and it's sending out and it's
[1:51:45] receiving and it's taking pictures it's
[1:51:46] looking around what are they looking for
[1:51:50] if you'll read and Christ is revealed in
[1:51:54] his own word right where brother Brandon
[1:51:56] mentions Einstein on the next page he
[1:51:58] says now they they they're going to take
[1:52:00] and they're going to look out there and
[1:52:02] they think they're looking 100 million
[1:52:03] light years or so out there he says that
[1:52:05] they're going to find out they're just
[1:52:06] looking at
[1:52:08] the backs of them
[1:52:14] but that's what the mechanical eye that
[1:52:17] took the picture
[1:52:18] of the pillar of fire but the pillar of
[1:52:21] fire itself is the life not the picture
[1:52:24] so what God wants you and I to do is
[1:52:28] become the activated germ seed of God to
[1:52:32] produce his word in its season and the
[1:52:37] season right now is Rapture and Rapture
[1:52:41] has requirements it requires a change of
[1:52:45] the body now those people that have gone
[1:52:47] on before us
[1:52:48] are waiting for the resurrection
[1:52:54] what I want the bride of Christ to
[1:52:56] realize today through the preaching of
[1:52:58] the word of God and the quoting of it
[1:53:00] and the understanding and revelation of
[1:53:02] it is the resurrection lays in you
[1:53:06] if you are an in time
[1:53:09] on time
[1:53:11] seed of God
[1:53:14] and they are and they are rooting for
[1:53:16] you
[1:53:17] because they without us cannot be made
[1:53:21] perfect oh when they went beyond the
[1:53:23] curtain of time they they seemed like
[1:53:25] they was perfect oh no they was lacking
[1:53:28] something they didn't eat they didn't
[1:53:30] drink they didn't get tired brother
[1:53:32] Randolph said they didn't have the
[1:53:34] feeling that you and I have he hugged
[1:53:36] them sisters in it no
[1:53:38] there was no sensation
[1:53:43] but when the Son and Daughter of God hug
[1:53:45] each other it's like
[1:53:47] yeah
[1:53:49] you know what I mean yeah
[1:53:50] yeah don't you fellas be hugging no
[1:53:52] ladies now except your wife
[1:53:54] don't get the wrong idea but you
[1:53:56] understand when I when I hug a brother
[1:53:57] it's like yeah
[1:54:00] doesn't it feel we got this yeah
[1:54:03] and then three brothers get together and
[1:54:04] pray in the room we got this
[1:54:06] and then Six Brothers get together and
[1:54:08] hold hands and begin we got this
[1:54:13] what a fellowship
[1:54:15] what a joy divine
[1:54:17] leaning on the Everlasting Arms
[1:54:21] what a blessed peace what a joy is mine
[1:54:24] amen amen you want to finish
[1:54:30] it went from the thought of God
[1:54:32] in the beginning was the word now listen
[1:54:35] I want you to go to the the the if you
[1:54:37] care to to First John that's the
[1:54:40] Epistles of John just previous to the
[1:54:42] Book of Revelation you all know these
[1:54:44] scriptures but I just want to put the
[1:54:45] puzzle together today so that those of
[1:54:48] you who have not seen this picture
[1:54:49] before can go hmm I better sit down and
[1:54:52] consider this I mean maybe we ought to
[1:54:55] look a little deeper into this
[1:54:59] first John 5 verse 7.
[1:55:03] says for there are three that bear
[1:55:05] record in heaven the father
[1:55:07] watch now the word so there's where we
[1:55:11] know that the word is the Sun and it's
[1:55:14] the s-o-n by by the characteristic of a
[1:55:19] spirit that can't be seen which is the
[1:55:21] father investing itself into an entity
[1:55:25] that can be tangible that's the word and
[1:55:30] then the Holy Ghost most people don't
[1:55:32] realize is the author of the word so the
[1:55:37] Holy Ghost watch now authored the son
[1:55:39] yeah
[1:55:42] what is the Holy Ghost it's the office
[1:55:45] of God whereby he is not fulfilling the
[1:55:50] invisible spirit
[1:55:53] and he is not indwelling in the word he
[1:55:59] is himself
[1:56:00] think about it okay I am a Trion being
[1:56:04] you're a try and being
[1:56:05] I am a father because I have children I
[1:56:09] am a son because I have a father and I'm
[1:56:12] me
[1:56:15] the me part in type is the Holy Ghost
[1:56:19] why would people be afraid of the Holy
[1:56:23] Ghost it's because they've been taught
[1:56:24] through psychology and education and
[1:56:27] Academia that you could be somebody else
[1:56:29] yeah
[1:56:34] but God's word teaches you who you
[1:56:36] really
[1:56:38] are
[1:56:39] and and and in closing that's what the
[1:56:42] world is trying to crucify
[1:56:45] they're not crucifying Jesus Christ
[1:56:48] again they're crucifying the Son of God
[1:56:51] in the form of the word they want to
[1:56:54] stop that word why why does Satan want
[1:56:57] to stop that word why did they try to
[1:56:59] kill why did Cain kill Abel why did they
[1:57:02] try to kill the children the days of
[1:57:03] Moses why did they try to kill the
[1:57:05] children in the days of Jesus why are
[1:57:07] they killing children today it's because
[1:57:09] Satan is trying to stop that Lassie
[1:57:14] he was trying to stop the Original Seed
[1:57:17] Jesus Christ came busted down the door
[1:57:19] and said I'm him give me those keys
[1:57:22] you're done yeah
[1:57:26] amen
[1:57:29] well what Satan didn't know
[1:57:32] is 2 000 plus years we're going to have
[1:57:35] to go by so that God's plan could
[1:57:38] fulfill itself not just in the Sun
[1:57:42] but in his bride
[1:57:44] and we were in him that's why in the
[1:57:49] image of God these two shall be one both
[1:57:53] male and female so they're really trying
[1:57:55] to crucify watch now watch the world in
[1:57:58] his Spirit watch how they're trying to
[1:58:00] attract the children born or Unborn
[1:58:03] through the woman
[1:58:10] because Satan reads the prophecy in
[1:58:13] Genesis and says it's a woman's seed I'm
[1:58:15] gonna stop the woman's seed
[1:58:18] dummy
[1:58:20] I'll tell you right now Fred Sanford
[1:58:22] said you a dummy
[1:58:27] my wife squinting don't don't
[1:58:33] before I was saved I grew up in front of
[1:58:34] a television that's right
[1:58:37] I'll tell you what my first message I
[1:58:38] ever preached was called Rock of Ages I
[1:58:40] come out of rock and roll brother Donnie
[1:58:42] and I could see the inspiration I'm
[1:58:44] telling you the inspiration of God on
[1:58:46] gifted men
[1:58:49] who went astray
[1:58:53] in my generation it was John Lennon
[1:58:56] gifted
[1:58:58] wrote music that got millions of people
[1:59:03] to be drawn in
[1:59:05] with simple phrases rather like
[1:59:07] she loves you yeah yeah yeah
[1:59:15] help
[1:59:16] I need somebody
[1:59:19] see that was that was where gifts being
[1:59:21] misused
[1:59:26] [Music]
[1:59:28] for the wrong Glory
[1:59:32] why wouldn't we be willing to accept the
[1:59:34] gifts that God would use for his glory
[1:59:39] all right
[1:59:40] I believe I
[1:59:42] heard them before service up here sing
[1:59:44] it
[1:59:45] and worshiping
[1:59:49] but the hardest thing for God to do did
[1:59:50] you know there was something hard for
[1:59:51] God
[1:59:52] no brother no nothing so but the hardest
[1:59:55] thing nothing's too hard for God but the
[1:59:56] hardest thing for God to do is to get
[1:59:58] one mortal man to believe another
[2:00:00] because you're all sitting down there
[2:00:01] going you guys know better than me no
[2:00:02] I'm not I'm Chief pastoral I'm I'm the
[2:00:05] guy under Paul Paul said he's chiefest I
[2:00:07] can't take anything away from Paul yeah
[2:00:09] right
[2:00:11] brother Branham said he taught what Paul
[2:00:13] taught there shouldn't be any question
[2:00:16] when you read something Paul said that
[2:00:17] said no well brother Branham changed it
[2:00:19] over he didn't change nothing
[2:00:22] he magnified many things because that's
[2:00:24] what we're doing today we're not
[2:00:27] changing the gold into silver we're just
[2:00:30] polishing the gold so you could see your
[2:00:33] reflection in it
[2:00:34] the James Webb super telescopes mirrors
[2:00:38] are made out of gold
[2:00:41] the most reflective and conductive item
[2:00:44] we know of oh what a conductor
[2:00:49] what a reflection
[2:00:51] and here's the beautiful thing brother
[2:00:53] Donnie about God's word and us as his
[2:00:55] children when we look into the gold
[2:00:58] of God's mirror
[2:01:01] we don't see ourselves
[2:01:04] but like Sarah looking in Pharaoh's
[2:01:07] mirror we see a change
[2:01:09] individuals
[2:01:11] I'm not what I want to be and I'm not
[2:01:13] what I ought to be but I surely hate
[2:01:16] what I used to be but at some point that
[2:01:18] saying now that saying is gonna come to
[2:01:20] an end in the days of ananias and
[2:01:22] Sapphira
[2:01:23] there will only be one kind of believer
[2:01:26] in the church now there's three kinds
[2:01:30] but at some point in time there will
[2:01:32] only be and and they might be just
[2:01:34] dragging themselves like carrying the
[2:01:36] cross
[2:01:38] and sometimes they need a little help
[2:01:40] yep
[2:01:44] Jesus need a little help carrying his
[2:01:46] cross
[2:01:47] they just couldn't his physical body
[2:01:49] just couldn't make it he just he was 120
[2:01:53] pounds probably by the time he got to
[2:01:54] Calgary 110
[2:01:55] it collapsed
[2:01:59] but he's an on-time God
[2:02:01] Simon
[2:02:04] how could yeah he didn't think he didn't
[2:02:07] consider the consequences he knew the
[2:02:09] Romans were kicking and scourging and
[2:02:11] mocking and beating and and stabbing and
[2:02:13] pushing and shoving the people out of
[2:02:15] the way
[2:02:16] didn't stop Simon
[2:02:22] God is good
[2:02:24] in closing it went from a thought to a
[2:02:27] word which is the Sun and now it has
[2:02:31] become manifest In the Flesh they
[2:02:34] couldn't they couldn't crucify the word
[2:02:36] they could only pervert it they could
[2:02:39] not stop God they could not kill a
[2:02:41] spirit they cannot see or touch so they
[2:02:43] picked on the vehicle
[2:02:47] David don't feel bad
[2:02:49] when you picked on yeah
[2:02:54] yeah we carried the cross
[2:02:56] of the world
[2:02:58] on his shoulders and he rose
[2:03:02] from the dead we all know that the
[2:03:04] world's but what I want you to receive
[2:03:06] this morning as the resurrected crisis
[2:03:08] in the building he's in the buildings
[2:03:12] and he's bringing together a mystical
[2:03:14] body which is the body of Christ as I
[2:03:17] heard brother Louise say and he's the
[2:03:19] head and if the head Rises the body
[2:03:22] Rises with it can these Dry Bones live
[2:03:30] guarantee
[2:03:32] please stand
[2:03:37] man
[2:03:39] I did all that without even reading this
[2:03:41] quote that I want to read to you now
[2:03:43] here's the deal
[2:03:45] it's a long quote
[2:03:47] so I'm gonna give you
[2:03:49] where I got it from if that's okay
[2:03:53] and then you can read it yourself
[2:03:55] but I'll start at a paragraph 46. now
[2:03:58] notice he says the very essence of this
[2:04:02] Resurrection is to tell and to show and
[2:04:06] to prove that's why I picked the three
[2:04:08] subjects
[2:04:09] that Jesus is raised up from the dead
[2:04:12] he's not dead he's a living
[2:04:16] when it looked like he was in the Tomb
[2:04:18] on Saturday which was the seven day God
[2:04:21] sent a messenger to the seventh Church
[2:04:23] age that began to prove to show and to
[2:04:27] tell that he was raised from the dead
[2:04:29] and his name was William Marion Branham
[2:04:32] we do not believe he was God we believe
[2:04:34] he was of thy servants our fellow
[2:04:37] brothers
[2:04:41] but he was so close that John decided he
[2:04:44] might try to Bow Down and Worship Him in
[2:04:46] the Book of Revelations don't do it
[2:04:47] right right there's a quote and I
[2:04:50] believe it's in the Patmos Vision where
[2:04:51] brother Brown said they kick and knock
[2:04:53] you around today but he said someday
[2:04:54] they'll bow down at your feet and
[2:04:57] worship you
[2:04:58] know we're not looking for worship we
[2:05:00] don't want self-worship we don't want
[2:05:02] self-satisfaction but we want is is a
[2:05:05] living God Jesus is raised up from the
[2:05:08] dead he's not dead he's a living he
[2:05:09] lives here
[2:05:10] he's in us I'll be with you even in you
[2:05:14] a little while in the world seeth me no
[2:05:16] more yet ye shall see me for I'll be
[2:05:17] with you even in you under the end of
[2:05:19] the world now as Christians we all claim
[2:05:21] he is alive
[2:05:23] or we've been quickened from life from
[2:05:26] Death To Life by his spirit and if he
[2:05:30] haven't been quickened if we haven't
[2:05:32] been quick and then we've not been made
[2:05:35] alive
[2:05:39] that's why we say stay with the word
[2:05:41] stay with the word stay with the word
[2:05:42] because it is what is going to be
[2:05:44] quickened but don't you dare deny the
[2:05:46] spirit of God when it begins to rain
[2:05:48] down upon that seed now it rains upon
[2:05:51] the just and the unjust we can't help it
[2:05:52] if people go nuts
[2:05:54] we can't help it if they act crazy
[2:05:57] we can't help it if they don't have this
[2:05:59] seed in them but the water is watering
[2:06:01] what's in them that's the anointed ones
[2:06:03] at the end time it's the true anointing
[2:06:06] it's the true Reign but what it falls on
[2:06:08] is what's going to make the difference
[2:06:10] and Let Me Tell You Folks something when
[2:06:12] the seed of God through the word of God
[2:06:14] is living in you which is the Son of God
[2:06:17] and the spirit comes down it will race
[2:06:19] amen
[2:06:21] Christ
[2:06:23] from the dead
[2:06:25] did you realize
[2:06:29] we're apart
[2:06:38] sorry everybody's already standing
[2:06:43] nope
[2:06:46] let's pray
[2:06:48] Heavenly Father
[2:06:52] Lord yes we could continue to preach
[2:06:55] Lord for
[2:06:57] well for eons there's no stopping point
[2:07:00] Lord in you
[2:07:02] you who
[2:07:04] have no beginning and has no end
[2:07:08] Lord where are we where are we going to
[2:07:09] find it
[2:07:10] a place to stop
[2:07:13] when what you have
[2:07:15] informed us of Lord through the
[2:07:17] preaching of the word through the
[2:07:19] delivery of the word
[2:07:21] and through the spirit falling on that
[2:07:23] word Lord that now we've come to that
[2:07:26] final office
[2:07:30] three
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:33] perfection
[2:07:34] foreign
[2:07:36] it's the day of the Holy Ghost Lord
[2:07:40] we can't take the father and the son out
[2:07:43] because those were offices
[2:07:46] that the Holy Ghost itself filled
[2:07:50] which only can mean Lord that the Holy
[2:07:53] Ghost
[2:07:54] is the spirit
[2:07:57] that we called Elohim
[2:08:01] no beginning
[2:08:03] no end
[2:08:05] and father we use the word self-existent
[2:08:07] one because
[2:08:09] we don't understand what it means Lord
[2:08:11] not to be
[2:08:14] in a beginning Lord we began we we
[2:08:16] believe we began Lord
[2:08:19] but the word of God
[2:08:22] through the presence of God
[2:08:24] through the spirit of God had no
[2:08:26] beginning
[2:08:28] you were speaking to your attributes
[2:08:30] Lord before there was even a molecule to
[2:08:33] live in
[2:08:34] but how Lord
[2:08:36] it had to be through the agency of your
[2:08:39] thoughts
[2:08:40] that's why they thought the prophet of
[2:08:42] God was a mind reader
[2:08:45] but he wasn't Lord
[2:08:47] he was being used
[2:08:50] by you
[2:08:52] and your foreknowledge
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:57] to go through the land
[2:09:01] and cry out
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:04] to the rocks
[2:09:07] which became seeds
[2:09:10] which came forth
[2:09:13] and began to produce the results Lord
[2:09:15] that you desired to see
[2:09:18] before anybody could see anything
[2:09:20] I pray you'd help us this morning Lord
[2:09:22] to recognize that the resurrection that
[2:09:25] happened two thousand years ago or so
[2:09:27] Lord
[2:09:28] [Music]
[2:09:29] exists amongst us today
[2:09:33] in the hearts of your children Lord
[2:09:37] so difficult for us to comprehend father
[2:09:40] where it came from
[2:09:43] Nicodemus Lord
[2:09:46] had no idea that when Jesus said
[2:09:49] the wind comes
[2:09:52] and it goes where it wants to and you
[2:09:54] have no idea where it comes from
[2:09:58] that he was referring to a life
[2:10:05] and it's without question here this
[2:10:06] morning Lord that
[2:10:08] you have revealed yourself to us
[2:10:11] and the broadest
[2:10:13] sense Lord
[2:10:15] you've given us
[2:10:17] so much more
[2:10:19] than they've had in the past Lord
[2:10:23] it's the information age father because
[2:10:26] the information is available
[2:10:28] but it's not to be dissected Lord
[2:10:30] through the intellect
[2:10:33] is to be received in the heart
[2:10:37] because you said
[2:10:39] as we receive the word we become the
[2:10:41] word
[2:10:42] I pray father for each and every one and
[2:10:45] here this morning if there's one sick
[2:10:46] person Lord the Holy Spirit right now
[2:10:49] the healing virtue
[2:10:51] that in the beginning
[2:10:53] knew it was a Healer
[2:10:56] father that great Holy Spirit I pray now
[2:10:58] Lord that it would touch everybody Lord
[2:11:00] hear or within the sound of our voice
[2:11:02] father anyone that's in need father of
[2:11:04] any kind lord of the being tormented if
[2:11:07] they're oppressed or depressed Lord
[2:11:09] if they're not sure who they are this
[2:11:11] morning Father Make Them sure Lord I
[2:11:14] pray let it be firm
[2:11:18] in their soul
[2:11:21] because we just want to give you the
[2:11:23] honor and the glory
[2:11:25] and the praise
[2:11:27] in the precious name the name given
[2:11:29] above every name
[2:11:32] the name
[2:11:33] that was concluded to be both Lord and
[2:11:36] Christ
[2:11:38] the name of Jesus Lord this morning
[2:11:42] I pray father
[2:11:47] for your honor and your glory
[2:11:50] in Jesus name
[2:11:52] amen
[2:11:55] go ahead brother Luis God bless you

[2:13:33] now look at the advancement of man we
[2:13:37] talk about light
[2:13:39] I know when Dad was growing up and some
[2:13:41] of your older ones was growing up it was
[2:13:42] a little candle
[2:13:45] and he talks about doing his homework
[2:13:48] over we always call them a hurricane
[2:13:50] lamp it's just a little lamp with some
[2:13:51] kerosene in it it's got a little Wick in
[2:13:53] it and you got to do your you got to do
[2:13:55] your your class lessons right there at
[2:13:59] it because but it was light
[2:14:01] it was light
[2:14:04] then a little bit a little bit longer
[2:14:06] there was a bulb
[2:14:08] gave a little bit more life I know bro
[2:14:10] George remembers and we just go in those
[2:14:12] little houses and there'd be one light
[2:14:13] bulb hanging down
[2:14:15] and you couldn't see nothing 10 feet
[2:14:17] past that bulb well now we have LED
[2:14:20] light
[2:14:22] that one little bitty pen light or a
[2:14:25] laser light or locked a whole place up
[2:14:28] well I hope that we know one thing's for
[2:14:31] sure the same way with God
[2:14:34] we could only see him by candlelight
[2:14:37] but there was way more of him to see
[2:14:40] then there was a light bulb came on
[2:14:43] hello somebody that was a light bulb
[2:14:45] came on
[2:14:46] you got to see a little bit more
[2:14:49] now you get to see him in LED
[2:14:54] you get to see him in the lights you've
[2:14:55] never seen him before and I hope when
[2:14:58] that light turns on
[2:15:00] you see Jesus Christ first but you're
[2:15:02] going to see him in your brother and
[2:15:03] your sister you're going to see him
[2:15:05] as as you most of you know that go to
[2:15:08] church here I've been doing a series on
[2:15:10] the Statue of perfect man part 99 what
[2:15:13] we read that scripture in John 1 in the
[2:15:17] beginning was the word
[2:15:18] was with God and the Word was God and
[2:15:21] the Word was made flesh most people most
[2:15:23] people
[2:15:24] line goes back to 2000 years ago to that
[2:15:27] man yeah it started with that man
[2:15:29] but the words were being made flesh
[2:15:31] today in me and you
[2:15:33] that word that you took in today is
[2:15:36] going into your flesh and then your
[2:15:39] flesh is going to be motivated by what's
[2:15:41] inside you're either going to do right
[2:15:43] or you're going to do wrongness whatever
[2:15:44] the motivating factor is
[2:15:46] so but good to have you each and every
[2:15:48] one of you here that let's give brother

[2:25:32] heart out each and every one of you that
[2:25:34] sang preached
[2:25:36] and just walked through the door
[2:25:39] there's a lot of people didn't get up
[2:25:41] this morning
[2:25:43] right there's a lot of people millions
[2:25:45] of people in this 8 billion
[2:25:47] uh person world
[2:25:50] never saw the sun come up
[2:25:53] but I hope they saw the sun come up
[2:25:54] inside of them before the real sun came
[2:25:56] up that's what I asked you today
[2:26:00] don't let the sun don't let the natural
[2:26:01] sun go down on you till you know that
[2:26:03] the spiritual part the son the Son of
[2:26:06] God dwells in your heart because we're
[2:26:09] not guaranteed a day
[2:26:12] a breath a moment
[2:26:14] so this Easter Sunday
[2:26:16] reflect on one thing
[2:26:20] there had to be a death
[2:26:22] before there could be life
[2:26:25] and thank God for that you know it would
[2:26:28] be good to to to to give you life for
[2:26:31] your kids or I give my life for brother
[2:26:33] Chris but you know what there's no
[2:26:35] there's nothing inside of me that's good
[2:26:37] enough that when I did die I could go
[2:26:40] into Chris and make him better
[2:26:43] one man can do that
[2:26:45] only one
[2:26:47] only one man had that kind of spirit
[2:26:49] inside of him that's what he's talking
[2:26:51] about Adam Adam thought he could save
[2:26:53] Eve well he didn't save her like that
[2:26:56] because he wasn't her savior he was the
[2:26:59] son of God
[2:27:01] he could cover
[2:27:03] he could protect her
[2:27:04] but he didn't save her
[2:27:06] there was only one savior one man
[2:27:10] the Lord Jesus Christ died for your sins
[2:27:13] being God Almighty and the human flesh
[2:27:15] he put that flesh aside
[2:27:18] but guess what
[2:27:20] he rose
[2:27:22] at the third day he came back out of
[2:27:25] that grave
[2:27:26] to do one thing go inside of his people
[2:27:28] and as brother Chris said to birth
[2:27:31] himself
[2:27:32] into his children
[2:27:34] as only one man can do that
[2:27:36] and that's the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:27:39] he's eternal
[2:27:40] and if we connect ourselves to that as
[2:27:42] old brother Ernie Villanueva Lord bless
[2:27:44] his soul may he rest
[2:27:47] he said we plugged ourselves into the
[2:27:50] eternal
[2:27:51] we got unplugged in the garden
[2:27:53] but we now by the new birth we got
[2:27:55] ourselves plugged back into that Eternal
[2:27:57] strand that Eternal court and that's
[2:27:59] what we live off of we live off of that
[2:28:02] power of his resurrection that we can
[2:28:05] have a resurrection the Bible tells us
[2:28:06] into newness of Life as we do in the
[2:28:08] baptismal service we resurrect in
[2:28:11] newness of life I pray that your life
[2:28:13] from now on will be new
[2:28:15] and that you'll think more about the
[2:28:18] Lord pray more study more
[2:28:21] have more of a fervor because
[2:28:24] I was telling them the other day brother
[2:28:26] Chris you people think we're strange and
[2:28:28] we isolate ourselves we don't we just
[2:28:31] speak a different language
[2:28:32] if I went to you know if I went to China
[2:28:36] I'm not I'm not Chinese I don't speak I
[2:28:40] could learn it
[2:28:41] but I wouldn't learn it fluently as the
[2:28:43] person that spoke it from birth
[2:28:45] hello somebody spoke it from birth
[2:28:48] through birth we realize that we speak a
[2:28:51] different language
[2:28:52] amen so we're speaking a different
[2:28:55] language now than the world speaks a
[2:28:58] different thought process that's why
[2:29:00] they didn't like Jesus and why I didn't
[2:29:01] like the disciples
[2:29:03] it's because they were different but
[2:29:04] they were made different by what was
[2:29:06] inside of them
[2:29:07] and I was telling the other day brother
[2:29:09] Chris if you took 20 people out in the
[2:29:11] world just brought 20 people off the
[2:29:12] street set them in here today and let
[2:29:14] them listen to your sermon or any sermon
[2:29:16] with with Enlightenment or more light
[2:29:19] they'd think you're crazy what do you
[2:29:21] mean talking about a seed and talking
[2:29:22] about this and talking about that they
[2:29:24] just don't speak our language but I pray
[2:29:26] to God that that language will be so
[2:29:28] simple though that you'll be able to
[2:29:30] understand it the Common People heard
[2:29:33] his message gladly the Common People the
[2:29:39] dollar bill people not the fifty dollar
[2:29:41] bill people the dollar bill people hurt
[2:29:44] him gladly so good to be here today
[2:29:46] thank you all for coming thank you for
[2:29:50] giving up your time to be here this
[2:29:52] weekend for the three days that we had
