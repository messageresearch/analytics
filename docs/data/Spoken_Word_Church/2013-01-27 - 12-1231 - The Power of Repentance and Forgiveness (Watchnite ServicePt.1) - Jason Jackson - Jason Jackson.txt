extra time tonight so amen amen W Cy hit me cuz I didn't preach long enough yesterday but he wasn't here so open up then brother Toren told me I had lot more time tonight too so Terrence rather and so T ter long as we don't forget to call him for supper Psalms 32 and verse 5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin CA may God that is blessing you may be seated this evening I want to just look at if we can for a little while this evening on the power of repentance and forgiveness and actually I got this thought sometime back I was laying in bed one morning about 3:00 and I woke up and I had my iPod going and I I heard the words from Brother R say repent right so I began looking at that and going through the scriptures and studying it and and actually it goes together repentance goes together with forgiveness right amen and actually before repentance confession precedes that right right because if you don't confess that you're wrong how are you you ever going to repent amen right so so there's a great power in in the prayer of repentance there's healing in Repentance amen second chonicles 7 said If my people who are called by my name will humble there's the key humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land so forgiveness and healing are available when we turn from from our wickedness and when we repent of the sin that's in our lives amen Jason why are you preaching on repentance tonight cuz everyone of us he Paul said I die day so every one of us has a level of repentance that we have to do and every one of us is on the on the scale of 1 to 10 we all fit in here somewhere on the Forgiveness level also there's those we need to forgive and and we need forgiveness amen so and the power of repent begins with a humble confession and the acknowledgment of who we are and what we have done Amen brother Brandon says this in Perfection I'll give him a second to get it on the on the screen he says what is it oh God requires Perfection amen he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him amen but he's looking tonight no matter how much you sin or how little or how much you're still a sinner right and you cannot you cannot get it no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever think of it it's not nothing you do right it's not turning a new page no it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that bring brings you to Perfection and you are perfected in Christ Jesus so joining a church will never cover your sin right joining the church will never change your desires or change your life or change anything about all joining the church does is join is CH you jump from this one to this one all it does is change where you're dwelling out with exactly where you're fellowshipping with but if you still have a problem right you're the problem right right that's right I heard you've heard people say I I just need to change jobs I I just yeah you better get that out my way I just need to change jobs I need to I need to change I need to move from where I'm at and everything will be better everything won't be better because the trouble will follow you the first thing Lord what is wrong where's the problem at God remember said the problem's not your brother the problem not your sister the problem is me right exactly I'm the one that gets in the way I'm my work enemy and if I can recognize Lord I am my worst enemy I am confessing that to you I am going to repent and repent is not just to say well Lord I'm sorry right right right come on brother that's not repentance repentance is to turn away from what you're doing and go a different direction that's real repentance so no and brother says like this no drye confession will ever cover your sin no sir amen right it takes Godly sorrow and repentance and the grace of God to cover sin for the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed that Calvary to cover your sin that's God's provided way is repentance confession showing a result he said bringing forth meat of repentance showing sincerity right come on he carth for you he cares that you care rather right he said Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right that's right glory to God when when you not just say well you know I come up here and I give a little dry-eyed confession and or maybe I I dabbed a couple of tears away listen you have to die repentance means to die out and to change directions and I'm not living that way anymore I'm not going that direction anymore I don't have time to go that way anymore I have started a new route now and I repented of my sins I've been baptized and now he has promised to give me the gift of the Holy Ghost he said when you thoroughly repent and believe on the Lord and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's right you may make God a liar if you don't receive the Holy Ghost and God is not no liar listen he can do a lot of things but he can't lie and he can't fail right right many people in the church in the world today Desir to be delivered mhm but how bad do they desire it right right righten they want to be free from guilt free from chains that have them Bound for so long right right but they aren't ready to acknowledge and take our own responsibility that's it there's the key and and take responsibility for their behavior take responsibility for their actions right and they always going to say well the devil made me do it yeah oh yeah brother re he's the quot I think it's in' 64 65 and I can't remember the message but he says he says oh brother Brandon he said oh the devil made me commit adultery he said the devil didn't make you commit adultery he said if the devil made you commit adultery and you were full of the Holy Ghost then he had to be born again just like you are and then he'd be your brother cuz when God is sealed in the devil sealed outly amen he ain't my brother right oh no I'm not no K to him right amen fact we live in a world today in an age when no one wants to take responsibility for anything that's right well the devil made me do it or the preacher made me do it or the Deacon made me do it or Wade made me do it or somebody else my wife made me do it nobody everybody just wants to pass the buck along that's the way it's been since a garden of me and since the woman you gave me right yeah exactly oh God yes God help us amen I'm not going to ask any husbands in or not how many has ever said that Lord the woman you give me careful huh careful okay I'll skip that part of the message and you know every court trial actually begins with a plea that's right yes sir most people begin to ple of not guilty that's right all right we have you on video surveillance we saw you pull the trigger yeah and shoot the man I'm not guilty you're not guilty yeah did you do it mm well I'm not guilty yeah I'm not telling you what I did well there's a video camera right here you you did it I'm still pleading not guilty right and then the trial begins and you know hey what one excuse after another excuse after another excuse and you know cuz it it wasn't the guilty party's fault no right you take marriages when they fall apart nobody's at fault right well I didn't know it was her I didn't know it was him if he had just acted better she had just acted better see somebody's got to accept the responsibility and say Lord maybe it's me that needs to die maybe it is me that accept Paul help me if I'm wrong yes sir nobody wants to accept it nobody wants to accept sin in their life I'm guilty of sin yeah no we make excuses yeah and try to cover it up and try to pass the buck Hey listen the Deliverance portion of the cycle begins with confession and if you can't fess up to it to what we have done we will never ever experience the power of repentance right amen we'll never experience the power of even forgiveness right amen cuz what a change it makes it our life when Jesus comes in and he sets you free and Paul said that is therefore no condemnation any longer to them that are in Christ so we're just going in a cycle hide didn't do it tonight it ain't my fault yeah people get fired from a job I don't know why the boss fired me yeah I mean he caught me asleep for an hour and a half but you know it wasn't right fa yeah well whose was it right what me brother Jon well amen he wasn't your boss's fault he don't got to set the alarm clock to wake you up from lunch right and often we find ourselves become bogged down even by difficult situations that we need God's delivering Grace from but often but God will often wait and and for the burden and the consequence because now it's it's pushing down and we won't admit to it so now here comes one thing and here comes one thing and here comes another thing and if you are the elected seed of God God is going to get you to the place sooner or later till you're willing to make a confession that I'm wrong exactly amen right oh God that's right if you're the elect he's going to get you one way or the other he's going to call something to Humble you amen amen thank you Lord listen when you begin to confess you know you you watch the story unfold of David for 2 Samuel chter 12 David he the scripture tells us that he's a man after God's Own Heart and David he he was in love with God but he was also in love with women yeah right he had plenty of them 500 wives or whatever and 300 concubines Lord one yeah one I can Mar they afford one one yeah yeah right praise the Lord I don't need 500 I don't need two right but David he here he was and and the prophet comes to him one day and the na unto David and he came and unto him and he said there were two men in one city and one was rich and the other one was poor and the rich one had an exceeding many flocking and herds but the poor man had nothing but one little bitty lamb yeah right one little bitty L yeah which he had brought and nursed and grew up together with him and with his children and and then eat of his own meat and it drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and it was as unto him as a daughter and and and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own block and of his own herd to dress for the warfaring man and that was coming to him but he took the poor man's lamb and he dressed it for the man yeah course you know the scripture says more blessed is it to take that's what that's what the man's thinking you I'll take from him I'll keep what I've got right yeah actually the scripture says more blessed is it to give than it is to receive but David and David's anger rose up in him and he greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man have done this thing shall surely die right now watch watch the Judgment he's good exactly how many times do we the scripture also tells us judge nothing before sign and here's David given judgment for what the man was that was just above it little did David know he was the man cuz this was just a parable to David and David didn't catch what was going on now he's telling David he just David tells him he said this man shall die and he shall restore the lamb for old because he did this thing and because he had no pity and Nathan said to David you're man right I don't want to die thus say the Lord God of Israel I anointed thee King over Israel I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul and David and he begins to tell David what his punishment will be yeah his punishment wasn't what David was going to punish himself with right but God had a plan amen yeah and God says and I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Master's wives into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah and it and if that had been too little I would moreover have given thee such and such things wherefore thou Hast despise the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammono right now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house exactly because thou has despised me yet he's a man after God's Own Heart right but thou H has despised me Y and has taken the wife with your R to hit tight to be thy wife thus sayith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house right and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto Thy Neighbor yeah y de and he shall lie with thy wives and in the sight of this son yeah for thou did in secretly but I will do this thing before all of Israel and before the son and David said unto Nathan listen he didn't say I didn't do it no right no no you're wrong you're wrong Nathan listen a prophet is never wrong when he's bringing the word to the people cuz he's the one whom the word cometh to so now Nathan comes and he didn't make a mistake and he said well you know I should have chose one of somebody else life Sur that was the man that s to UAH what no it was David amen and when the word come to him David didn't get mad right who's been talking to the preacher yeah yeah yeah no David said I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto him David the Lord also hath put away thy sin and th thou shall not die listen David should have died but God rich in Mercy Hallelujah the Forgiveness power of God when a man of God admits that I've been roong the power of forgiveness and the power of repentance takes a man and puts him back in contact with God yes sir this well this man failed and this man committed oh let me tell you there's a lot of men that makes mistakes and they do a lot of terrible things but that don't mean they can't be saved amen right brother amen exactly yes sir we had a situation back home one time and man did a horrible thing wasn't even part of the church at the time horrible thing I won't even tell you it was it was bad and people said he ought to die for that you they to put him in prison and give him the death penalty everything else well what about us yeah come on right have we forgotten where we came from what did Apostle Paul say such were some of you some of you were adulter some of you were Idol some of you was this and that and the other but now he has Sanctified you he has Justified you he has cleansed you by the power of the blood exactly listen and if we take away the blood that we take away the the thing that keeps us how bit because of by this de thou H has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blashe right the child also that is born of thee shall surely die right and Nathan departed into his house and the Lord struck the child that uriah's wife be to David and it was mer you watch if David would have just waited be Shea was going to be his wife eventually anyhow yeah cuz that's who the seed line had to come through it was all in the predestinated mind of God the plan but he got ahead and had a man killed right and David listen to what David did David went in David therefore besought God for the child and David fasted and went in and lay all night upon the Earth Yep and Elders of the house of and went to him to raise him up from the Earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with him right it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the Servants of David feared to tell him when the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken into our voice how will he then Vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead right and when David saw that his servants whispered David perceived the child was dead and David therefore David said unto his servant is the child dead and they said he is dead and David got mad and stomped his feet and said I'm just going to quit serving God no no sir I asked God and God said he give me the desire for her and he didn't answer I'm just going to quit brother no I what David did cuz neither want anybody if they're after God's Own Heart David [Music] arises watch himself yep anointed himself changed his apparel came into the house of the Lord and worshiped amen then he came to his own house when he required and they set bread before him and he did eat we we have a sister back home one of you know Sister Jamie last or some of you do her mother goes to our church and I I was talking to her the other day on the phone and she said this is before she actually started getting better she said brother Jason I don't want to be selfish so I asked God if he would I'd like to keep my daughter but I don't want to be selfish she said and if for some reason he chooses not to let her live she said I'm going to get up I'm going to wash my face and I'm going to go to the house of the Lord and I'm going to worship amen right you know if you can keep that kind of an attitude in the midst of trouble let me tell they ain't going to have no problem with you confessing when you're wrong right there ain't going to be no problem when you getting forgiven this right right then his servant said unto him what thing is this that thou Hast done thou did Fast and weak for the child while it was yet while it was alive but when the child was dead thou did rise and eat bread and he said while the child was yet alive I fasted and we where I said who can tell whether God will be gracious unto me that my child may live but now that he is dead wherefore should I fast can I bring him back again no but I can go to that's right I shall go to him but he shall not return to me amen amen I can go to them sure listen when it's God's time to take somebody ain't going need me questioning right no sir right I don't understand a lot of things I'm L A lot of people die I don't even understand all together why my mother died when she was 57 years old you know I wasn't the one to question right right cuz it's all in God's Tim right amen and God's way righten and as I thought on my way brother says I wonder tonight and and wouldn't say this but maybe there'd be another David sitting here tonight that's as guilty as David was and when you turn your light out at night you see your brother's face yeah the man that you defiled his loving wife broke up his home yeah flickering on the side of your wall right or some woman you see the woman's home that she broke up by running off with her husband yeah it ought to bring you to repentance and sackcloth and confession what the church needs tonight is a confession right and making right to come back to the testimonies of the Lord there's Mercy forgiveness seems that it would haunt people going on know that you're walking hour by hour in the face of death why do we continue on with selfishness and greed and ungodliness right and our eyes on the things of the world is time we turn back to God testimonies to God testimon as I follow on my ways I turn my feet to thy testimony amen amen know I think of the the lady who was losing her mind and she'd been in ever insane institution and tried to get help everywhere right I'll try to stay behind up here brother and he says I I tried to you know I've tried to Adit at everything and I and I can't find peace and they can't find out what's wrong with me right and brother B looks at her and in just 5 minutes time or less he says I'll tell you what's wrong and the doctors and the psychiatrist and nobody else will ever find it and you'll never get any better unless you repent right well what is it brother bam he said 20 something or 30 years ago you were in a green dress and you and another man had an affair right she said but brother brand I repented of that yeah to God he says you didn't sin against God yeah come on he sinned against his wife or she sinned against her husband that b Sinn against his wife right and he said the only way you'll ever get Deliverance is to go make it right right she said my husband would leave me it would be over with you know I I can't do that he says then go on you're not going to get any better you're going to continue you're going to lose your full mind and finally finally he says okay I'll tell you something else your husband has the same thing to tell you right yeah and it happened day before yesterday or last week it was the woman he was what was in a pink dress and he was in a Chevrolet car on the other side of the railroad track and she said not my husband he said go get him yeah right bring him here they leave and sister goes you think they'll be back he goes they'll be back yeah it wasn't wrong here they came yeah and there he began to make his confession she made her confession her mind comes back to her she is restored again and he's a deacon in the local church down the road and he said I'm going to go home and resign and the prophet said no you go back and continue as you are they figure that one out yeah abolutely right brother that's right sometimes we put God in a box yeah and just about the time we put him in a box by the way he blows the top of it I would have thought he stood re but see we miss the power of repentance we miss the power of that forgiveness that come you miss the power of the blood thank you Jesus what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood right Lord so then repentance is more than just a confession right right amen repentance frees you from your sin amen hallelujah the sin that has held you bow when you really repent it frees you from that right amen confession is just an acknowledgement of the sin right repentance is an actual turning yeah right from that sin right and going a different direction brother l i i i repented of that online pornography but I went back to it the next day you didn't repent right you might have made a confession which was starting that way but the repentance was I ain't going back to that right exactly oh that thing's not going to continue to follow me oh brother it went through my whole family and you know it's just something I have to live with because my daddy fought with that battle and my mama fought with that battle or my great great grandpa was high Pastor let me tell you there ain't nothing in this world that the Holy Ghost can't control and if you have a problem with something committed to the Holy Ghost the prophet said that little girl there that had the epilepsy that came from her great great grandmother right but he said as I was saved when that Abstract title deed comes and she receives the Holy Ghost everything that was ever held against her is then stri it off exactly that's the power right of this word sorry bu we was even talking today I believe it was brother w we don't understand things when God tells a prophet to go marry a right absolutely huh he says go marry a woman of whoredom yep y that blows our minds cuz that's against the levitical law right right but who can figure out the ways of God right no nobody can no so this was more repentance and changing and and and and and confession it's more than just saying the way I lived was wrong yeah right amen changing the way you live right Hosea 14:1 says oh Israel returning to the Lord thy God amen for thou H has fallen by thine iniquity take with you words and turn to the Lord and say unto him take away all iniquity and receive us graciously so we will render the calves of our lips as sure shall not save us we will not ride up horses neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands you are Gods you are our gods for in thee the fatherless find Mercy I will heal their backsliding will love them freely for my anger is turned from them right right that's what looks like oh here in this verse verse 1 through3 for the Lord ha stumbled we have stumbled because of your iniquity take take words with you return to the Lord right and say to him take away our iniquity forgive us of our sin we're not going to do the things we once did we're not going to worship these people we're not going to tell them they're our gods they had a confession and they had a real repentance amen amen then what happens God always comes by and would heal their Nation absolutely amen heal their land and if a person will ever completely come clean right right then they'll never if they don't come clean they'll never experience the power of exactly you see people Bound in mental conditions and most of the time I'm not saying every time most of the time when people have things like this and they have demons upon them something happened somewhere to allow that Spirit to come in right and if they try to go around the bush about it or beat around the bush and they never will come clean with it then they'll never really get Deliverance you can put them in hospitals you can put them in AA meetings or whatever they are alcohol and on you can put them in rehab and it might help the person get free from that but it don't deliver them from the spirit it takes the power of the Holy Ghost to come down and deliver brother praise the Lord constantly you see people they constantly one brother called it camp meeting cramps yeah they ever camp meeting same peoples at the altar say every same people yeah pouring their heart out confessing confessing confess I won't you go back and start professing right yeah I'm different I'm changed I'm not going that way oh but I I've lived such a horrible life listen Jesus Christ don't care how horrible of a life you live he's not looking at the life you once live once it is put under the blood he can no longer remember the life you once live who's the accuser of the Brethren the devil is he's the one that comes pour this thing up somehow no I'm not ju forny I'll put it in my pocket there you go Joel would blow your mic so it causes a person to live a defeated life y cuz every time they get down to prey there's the sin again yeah right well I I need to conest it again cuz you know it's still there yeah no one you ask God he don't remember it any longer listen I wouldn't want to dig up my past I'm sure you wouldn't want to dig up your past and I'm sure there's a lot of people oh no don't go down my 10 turn alley but let me tell you the Holy Ghost is here to examine our hearts and life and he'll go down our 10 10 if it ain't under the blood the Holy Ghost is that deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart and he's the one making his way down on the aisles he's the one we invited here tonight he's the one that comes and quickens to our mind but you did this Lord I confessed it I was guilty and I Repent God by your grace I'm never going to do it again and I'm going to walk the other direction amen amen you take a man he gets up and he goes to work first morning he goes this way and he falls in a hole I'm zeld the hole continues on the work works right here next day he gets up he goes out he falls in the same hole something ain't going on right right cuz now he's going over here all right next morning he gets up let's hope he

defeated life right and when you see them one Sunday oh praise the Lord next Sunday yeah mhm they not a maning no they not raising their hands right what's wrong brother oh I've had such a terrible week yeah and I I've counseled couples before older couples and they're fighting and going back un for I said you know what you need to do you need to start listening to tapes together you need to start praying together you need to start doing things together right amen oh okay 6 months later I said you do what I told you to do the first time well no then why are we here again I'm going to tell you the same thing again right yeah right amen and until they can until people can learn to do what the word says right that's it why give them something else right right give them more of the word well they're going to have to start with the basics right right and if people can never completely repent you can never right have Victory right amen you have to completely be honest with yourself right and a lot of people can never forgive theel right there's where the Forgiveness comes in now they could never forgive well I did so many things and and I harmed so many people true amen true maybe true but what can wash away your sins huh oh how could I ever how could I ever forgive myself I heard a family I busted up a home let me tell you there's been a lot David busted up a home but David repented and God gave him forgiveness exactly Luke chapter 17 said then said Jesus said unto his disciples it is impossible but that offense is will come yeah so there's going to be things coming our way right to try to detour us right yeah and he said but woe but but woe unto him through whom they come yeah right it were better for him that a millstone were hanging about his neck he was cast into the sea then he should offend one of these little r take heed to yourself he says if I brother trespass against thee yeah rebuke him right and if he repent forgive him amen exactly and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn to thee again and say I Repent Thou shalt forgive him and in one place he says 70 times seven exactly if I come up to you 490 times and I punch you right in the nose sorry yeah sure you going to have to forgive me I'll have to repent yeah oh Hallelujah that's pretty good for forgive us both Lord and the apostles said unto the Lord increase and listen Jesus is telling them what to do how to forgive and they say Lord increase our faith right Y and the Lord says yeah if you had Faith as a grain of a mustard seed you might say to the SIC ofine tree be thou plucked up by the root y be thou planted in the sea and it should oy you amen listen another place Jesus says if you say to this mountain be REM but in this place he says if he says to this sycamine tree be thou removed and plucked up he said he pluck it up by the root and don't leave the root there right yeah leave the root there to grow again right take the root out get every bit of it out because listen offenses are going to come but woe unto him by whom they come and when you forgive somebody don't leave one o of root of bitterness there get every bit of it out or will come back again right well brother Jason what in the world the disciples said Lord increase our faith what does faith got to do with forgiveness good question yeah yeah brother B said faith is based on forg right faith in God's pardon and mercy he said will enable us to overcome the greatest difficulties in the way of forgiving our brother yeah right now listen I can understand Sinners not forgiving one another right right I can totally get that right but what I can't figure out is how people and I don't know none get problems here so I'm how people go ahead who claim to be brothers and sisters mhm who go a church with each other how can they good to see you brother Dutch and sister April glad you can make it amen I told him I was going to get you when you was late I forgive you though how can brothers and sisters who sit in church together come on brother how can they sit there with bitterness in their hearts how can we sit there with hatred in our hearts and yet claim to be Believers listen how can we do that we don't have any Faith right oh brother Jason Brother Sam pray for me yeah pray for you yeah you hate half the church right right what good you going to do me to pray for you right until you can forgive Those whom has brought offenses to you or Those whom you think have brought offenses those that might have hurt your little pet feeling or maybe the preacher preached on something you were doing or whatever the case then you can actually forgive them from the bottom of your heart you ain't going nowhere exactly just stuck here right right that's right brother amen true brother Jason Hey listen I had a lady tell me one day she yelled at me actually on the churchyard in front of the deacon and said I don't have enough

no harm now listen you heard us what we preached yesterday on the anointed it listen it isn't just ministers that's anointed exactly but if you offend one of these my little ones it'd be better for a millstone hung about your neck and you cast into the sea cuz you are the anointed children of Jesus Christ you are the Lamb's wife right Budd so I have trouble understanding why people that can set beside each other righten and we're all going to heav together oh yeah we are we're all going to heaven together oh yeah I have to sit right here cuz there's 200 people in here and I can't stand stand

they're mad at him because he's spiritual and he's telling them dream and he's prophesying to them what's going to happen to them and what's going to become of him and all these great things and they get mad at him they take him down they sell him well then they throw him in a pit and oh you know we're going to have to take this coat we're going to have to tell them you know the story that Joseph died yeah oh yeah he was attacked and he died yeah but through the whole thing Joseph was a man with a pure heart right he was a type of Jesus Christ and as he stood there and his brothers were were doing all the persecution to him he never got angry right right scripture never tells us he got angry kicked on him no hated him right now he's put in a position to preserve life right right right they did it to be able to preserve life they didn't know they did it for that reason neither did the Jews know that they were rejecting Jesus Christ so that they would preserve your life but yet that's what happened right exactly amen and so here they are you know get rid of him get rid of him he's down here in Pharaoh's house and before long he's become the man of the man and there's a famine happening right and the brothers begin coming and Joseph has changed in 30 years right looks quite a bit different yeah might lost a little hair yeah got gray whatever the problem yeah just got a little older and it ain't long they're beginning to tell him these things and he sending them food right then he begins to ask them yeah what about your father where's your daddy at don't you'all have a daddy right yeah we we have a daddy he's he's pretty old right now and he's sent us down here and and you know then he begins asking what you got anybody you got any other brothers yeah yeah man oh yeah we got one more his name is Benjamin oh man something happening in Joseph's heart cuz that was his own flesh and blood and he had never seen him yet and he tells him hey you know the story he goes through it you're going to have to bring Benjamin up here for I release anymore right that's good brother we're not going to be able to bring daddy don't want nothing to happen to Benjamin yeah well if you want anything else you're going to bring Benjamin right well we'll see what dad says he lets him go they come back when they get Benjamin there Joseph dismisses listen to he even dismisses his wife right right leaves her in the palace right amen and begins to reveal himself to his brothers right and then they fall down and say oh Joseph you're surely going to kill us for all the horrible things we did to you right and Joseph says don't be angry with yourselves don't be upset with yourself God allowed it to happen to be able to preserve life amen that's right amen hallelujah to preserve life and he begins to fall upon the neck of Benjamin and begins to weep and he reveals things to them hey we wonder what happened to you we told lies upon you yeah but I don't remember your Li I will forgive your Li I'm a tye of Jesus Christ righten offences must come y Joseph didn't seek revenge amen exactly that's right Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart right for they shall see God Amen and Joseph knew what the value of forgiveness was right yes amen amen therefore he could forgive his Brethren who had never asked n for forgiveness that's right Amen brother J owe me an apology a lot of people probably do yeah yeah you know what you are to forgive them regardless if they ask you or not the scripture didn't say only forgive those who ask nothing right right on forgive them anyways oh Lord I don't want nothing in my life I I'm coming to you God I am confessing my fault I had hard feelings against this brother or that sister but Lord I confess that thing tonight and I I'm going back that way anymore and I'm seeking your power of forgiveness in my life change me God and let me forgive them also I don't want that roote of bitterness you leave the room there hey there's a reason why Jesus said pluck the tree and the root and all exactly you have to get rid of the whole thing that's right WIP their slate clean y amen I tell you right now we begin looking at people under that angle yeah you look at everybody cuz the devil shows you everybody's faults yeah say well brother Samuel ain't got any faults well oh I don't know what they are but you hang around them long enough right you'll see things man that ain't I didn't know brother Samuel did that but start looking at it through the eyes of God and every individual that comes up before you

whole lot of things rode in it and you don't want nobody looking at you at what you was when you was 15 years old or 17 years old or 25 years old but the day that you give your heart to Jesus Christ and he made you a brand new creature and he took away the old man and buried that old man you have all those things wrot in the book but when now the accuser comes and he says well what about all

who who so you mean there's people sitting on the few next to us that might have an organizational spirit cuz they're someone Discord right absolutely so it's Discord among the we should be standing in the brid and saying we are brothers right some people only want to cut down the tree but it says get rid of the root right well if I just cut down this part of the problem and cut down this part of the problem well if you don't get the root out it's going to grow again as soon as a little somebody comes by sprinkles a little bit of water on that thing right there a little bit of fertilize you

iten but he's going to have to realize it may be me yeah yeah amen right ain't nobody in the church right I'm the only one yeah well brother B said there wasn't going to be but a few yeah yeah he did yeah that's what he said yeah but he didn't tell you how many was a few right right might be one here he said might be one here might be one there right and he also said sometimes you got to preach like everybody's going right right sometimes you preach like ain't nobody going right but the one thing about it is make sure you're going if I preach that ain't nobody going say well he didn't preach to me tonight cuz I know I'm going I know my heart is right I know no matter what the devil brings at me if he brings offenses at me the scripture tells me no weapon formed against me shall ever Prosper but I will be Victorious and in today we're living in Satan's on a war path right amen he's got every form of entertainment every form of everything he can get to you just to try to keep you from coming to the house of God to try to keep you from praying to try to keep you from div Amen brother you'll wake up too late mm company will stay too late yeah you'll work too hard and it's just as easy to say oh Lord bless the day yeah yeah that must have been pretty close right there yeah app yeah thank you here we are not not to you I wouldn't say it to you but yeah you got to come quiet and when the enemy listen we got to continue to grow in the word of God I want more of God than brother said read your Bible and pray every day amen good friend of mine out west said they was in a meeting they or they wouldn't they got Brother Hey brother give us a edge tell us something that nobody else knows yeah weig above everybody yeah yeah give us some give us a little bit he read goes pray pray pray read your Bible every day amen on Amen they were like what yeah that's it so he's looking for something you know a little more detailed than just reading your Bible and praying but that's as simple as it is listen if you'll read if you'll pray Lord why am I here huh we'll get closer to God right see listen when the enemy comes in like a right right the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard right but if we're not being there Lord keep me in your will keep me in your word reading our Bibles praying seeking God seeking his Direction when the enemy comes in it's going to go over the flood gate right but he said I will raise up a standard and the waters come up and almost get over it sometimes and he raises it up a little higher and it comes back up he raises it up a little higher and the rain comes a little more and he raises is a little bit high and every day you're still awake you're still on fire for God oh I thought I was going to lose it today but just about the time I thought I'd lose somebody gave me a phone call and told me that God loves me that's right bu amen yes sir this is a true story there's a brother one time he was he was crippled and he was in a wheelchair and he couldn't get out of his wheelchair very just to walk around the bar one day he got up and he was walking his way around the bar and he was getting him a glass of tea did and he's depressed and he said Lord just wished I could hear you tell me verbally your voice Lord I just wish I could hear you tell me that you love me and his pastor's out working in his barn and the spirit of the Lord comes on him and says call brother so and so and tell him that I love him amen praise the Lord right right amen right he said I just picked up the phone brother I don't know why I'm calling you other than the Lord just told me to call you and tell you that he loved you amen listen God's mindful of his children whatever we have need of Lord I need you tonight more than I need healing in my body I need salvation I need the whatever you have need of just breathe it to him Lord I need it and he's ever present there to give you what you need right ever presentent help in the time of TR amen that's right enemy comes in God raises it up enemy comes in and if you ain't up where you need in a couple of weeks you're going to be overflowed that's right yeah right right and everything's going to be going haywi you're going to wonder why am I sinking but if you're sinking do like Peter did cry out for help Lord save me amen listen at least he made a step at least he stepped out by faith to begin with yeah he began to look at the circumstances and he might have began to doubt a little bit and he began to sink down a little bit but Jesus was there to pick him up and his despair when he recognized his wrong he asked for mercy God says those that draw nigh to me I'll draw nigh to live amen amen now Jesus says the prayer in Matthew chapter 6 teaches his disciples how to pray right and the prayer says forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us right now if you pray that prayer yeah that's the most scariest prayer right in the entire Bible right list how is that scary cuz you're asking God right to forgive me like I forgive others come on now come on and if you don't forgive others right you don't get forgiveness exactly your your forgiveness is based on how you forgive others right Lord forgive me like I forgive others right mm that's that's pretty that's pretty scary right but that's why what we're asking right right listen oh they did this that doesn't matter forgive them move on if you don't it'll destroy you will amen yes sir it will I've seen families destroyed I've seen individuals destroyed all because they kept something in their heart that if they' only said you know what they didn't mean to do that right I know they did well come on brother that Spirit meant to do it right but they didn't to do it right right oh God Jesus telling them how to forgive and how often to forgive and the disciples said Lord increase our faith right cuz without faith it is impossible to please God listen you know the story there in Luke chapter 5 verse 17 there's a man who's lowed down through the roof and on a certain day as he was teaching and there was the es and the doctors of the law sitting by yeah which were come out of every town of Galilee in Judea right and behold men brought in a bed which was taken when man was taken with a py and they sought means to bring him in and they lay lay him before him and when they could not find they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up on the house stop talk about faith we're going to get there whatever it takes we're get to Jesus and they let him down through the tiling and his couching into the midst before Jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto the man man thy sins are forgiven right what's forgiveness of sins got to do with being well right come on brother huh and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies yeah who can forgive sins but God Alone Oh yeah they didn't know who was in their midst right right it was God Emmanuel made flesh standing there able to forgive sin before the blood was even shed that's right that's right yes sir God but when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason you in your heart whether it is easier to say thy sins be forgiven or to say rise and walk right cuz if his sins were forgiven he was rise right amen but that you may know the son of man have power upon Earth to forgive sins amen he said unto the sick of PA I say unto you arise take up thy couch and go into thy house right amen glor see what God's looking for is respect sir glor right he respects the faith that's in the individual right yeah right mhm that's even why that's why even brother said prostitutes could come through the prayer line right and receive their healing yeah right and real Born Again Believers miss it yeah right and I was and I preached on that one night and I was down at McDonald's and a sister asked me said I don't understand how people can walk up and be healed before they get to their seat and they're sin in their lives I said help me Lord yeah come on and I just open my mouth start speaking Yeah take no thought of what you saying that now that's right right that's right Lord help me yeah right he said it wasn't their prayer it was their faith in the prayer right it was their faith if they got before brother b or if they got before whoever to anoint them and pray for that's going to be made well G so it was faith God respects the faith he said that's in the individual and James 5:14 he said if any sick are among you let them call the Elders of the church let them anoint them in all and pray over them and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and if they've done any sin it shall be forgiven them talk about power in this word the power of forgiveness the power of repentance can't you see the benefits a Believer has amen man there's healing there's forgiveness there's joy there's peace there's happiness there thank you Jesus Hallelujah there's all kinds of things right when Jesus when Jesus was dying he uttered some of the most powerful words y that would ever be uttered upon Earth yeah but in Jesus is dying he's expecting in 3 days to resurrect yeah all right in three days it's going to be the biggest event that's ever happened yet amen but if he don't get up from the grave there is no New Testament Church there is no Pentecost there is no any of those things if he don't raise from the grave hey we're all lost right but Jesus in his dying moments thought enough about it to stop y right and say father forgive them right amen they don't even know what they're doing right that's right yes sir bu and if Jesus thought enough about that what about us right right come on sir listen Jesus could have not have raised Lazarus from the grave that never would have changed one thing no right he could have not ever healed the leopards it never would have changed one thing but if he didn't forgive those men and he didn't go down in that grave and he didn't resurrected out of that grave Hey listen we ain't having church tonight exactly we're still under the blood of PS and goat but because he was able as even a man when he went to the cross that Spirit left him and he had to die a man cuz the spirit can't die right and when he went up there as even that he said father I pray that you forgive them right yeah and then after him here comes along Steven he was a deacon in the church right right and he testified and did all kinds of things and even Apostle Paul hel his cloak while he was stoned to death and and and Steven sat there and he says the exact same words Jesus did right am cuz he's a Son of God father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and when offenses comes to a Believer we should say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing exactly right amen it don't matter if he never heals your body right that's right come on right right now exactly you can't forgive right you can't be forgiven and when Jesus was riled upon he didn't R back right and when evil oh this is when evil was spoken of him he didn't speak evil back right right amen come on yes Hallelujah everybody shall yes it's hard yeah right when somebody's giving you down the road oh yeah and somebody's always persecuting you yeah it's hard right but you have to make the decision to rise above it listen you've got to make the decision I don't have the time to give into this bitterness or to get into this unforgiving Spirit I've got better things to be doing right praise God brother that's what Jesus taught the disciples in Matthew chapter 6 M yeah Y and all of us are on some level as I said that when we first started that we need forgiveness or we need to show forgiveness right Jesus forgive them without them ever asking him right to forgive them right exactly they never said forgive us I still got B it's all right good he forgive him without them asking him to right and he was willing to forgive you right amen thank you Lord listen when you are yet a sinner right you are in his mind very Calvary you never even asked him to forgive you but he forgave you before you ever even asked forgiv he already knew you would be forgiven Hallelujah That's The Power of my God that's right amen that Sinners men that could be born in sin and shaped in iniquity who could be worthless scum of the earth yet he can reach down his hand for you and pick you up out of a pit and know your very desire of your heart Thank You Lord says this in 1950 so there was a lady come across the platform another instance and I took a hold of her hand and she had a female vibration and I said you have female trouble and she had a little boy on her arm she said yes sir I said you believe me she said with all of my heart and I told hold of her hand and I began to pray and it wouldn't leave her I said sister I don't understand why are you a Christian she said yes sir and a vision began to move yeah now remember the woman standing there and was told of living untrue to her marriage vows four days before that before the audience of 20,000 people over this was in Jonesboro Arkansas better listening and she started crying and The Man Behind her was her husband and he jerked her around and said what's this you see why I had to pray often he said what's this she said darling I'm sorry he said I just let myself loose and it moved over him and told him the same act he had with his bookkeeper right right and the car they were in and where they were at and he turned white and he said brother what must I do and he looked at her and he reached his hand out and said darling I've been a rra that's what he was amen I've been a wrapped said if you'll forgive me I'll forgive you and we'll start life a new right here before God's people and she said I forgive you and that little boy between them hug one another and knelt down there on the floor and give their hearts to God listen that's what happens when the anointed word is their PR it's deserting the hearts and lives of men right amen then they went and got baptized and was added into the church right so that's the way the Lord HS amen so forgiveness is a gift that not that you give others right but that you give yourself you're saying when you forgive someone I can't afford yeah to put this much energy yeah into being angry with you right I can't afford to every time you walk in the room I'm upset with you there's too much energy to put in that direction and I need to be put it into getting closer to God and encouraging other people so therefore I forgive you amen you talking about feeling a whole lot better right yeah right brother it'll lift the burdens off of your shoulders that's right brother amen everything will be so much better right amen so Hey listen there might even be somebody here tonight that's holding The Grudge yeah come on or holding just a little bit of bitterness yeah but what you need to say tonight is that very same thing I ain't got the time of day to spend it upon what you did to me I've got a
