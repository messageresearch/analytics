and amen holy holy [Music] and amen and amen and amen good to be back upstairs and hearing everybody's singing and music and everything really great amen glad to be here yeah we've made the statement Wednesday night we'll make it again tomorrow where you can understand if you want to set down the stars feel free to there's nobody ruling nothing of doing if you want to sit down stars and view the services it will be made available if you want to come into your car and park out in a parking lot it will be made available to wear that you can because we don't want nobody to feel that they're obligated to have to do this that or the other this is all coming to church should be volunteer basis anyway nobody can go out and compel you to do and make this that or the other and in all that's not true not the right thing to do but just it you know if you want to if you want to or brothers are having a mask if you want to wear a mask that's fine nobody has any problems we just want you to be satisfied within your own self and doing your own part and serving the lord from that does everybody understand that that do it now I make a couple of announcements this morning that a figure need to be made you know we don't know what the hour is of how that things are going to keep working and what they're going to do we do what we do for the church and you know and and doing the best that we can to serve God here in the search and the doings and and to serve Him because that's the one we're here to serve we're not here to try to satisfy anybody else I think that we done the right decisions when we made the decisions to you know move about do things and and everything like that I think it was right to do that and if necessary we'll do it again whatever is necessary because as long as the government is not fooling with our spirituality I feel that we can you know go along with what they're doing and things like that maybe 30 40 years ago you might have had a different idea and I might have had a different idea but still it's come down to the last days you know I've altered you from day one I don't believe this is the end of the world and that respect but I believe it is the beginning of the end I believe it's in the basis of the volunter state because he's going to come in by flattery you know invited in and etc like that not forcefully so it won't be a great forceful thing to beginning it's going to be gradual you know you say well what do you think about the economy for this I don't know because man they can change this thing before we get home that's serious and it is very serious so I've encouraged you to do one thing I'll get your ducks in a row for naturally speaking and things like that you know keep everything going don't go out and and you know be wild about it just be what you want to be and and serve God and and you know like that now and that would we'll take care of a lot of the the situation's of life because we don't know you know I don't know we've never been at a place like this now we've had world time troubles and we've had countries that had troubles but we never had a time that the entire world was at a problem it's not just our nation and not just our point every nation in the world is is involved in this because it is an economical Christ I don't know why it was brought on I've told you somebody else that's pulling the strings that's all I can say and all I know it ain't this that or the other you well I'm against this I'm against there we're just doing the best we can to survive and and be a Christian in what we're doing so remember that way and keep it in mind and like I said if you want to go down start if you want to do those things do it and feel free to but to you that want to come up here and sit down and worship and and have a good time in the Lord we can worse you can sing down stars whether you can sing up stars you know you can do all of the things and we can have that alright now it may come until word that we don't know from data one to two you may be and we all may be without a job within a week oh that's been proven that it's been done alright that's what I my warning is is to look at the signs around us because they can do anything they want to naturally speaking you know because they can just whack it down right now and some of you have already had to take pay cuts you've already had to be up days off you've already had to change things so you don't know what that's going to be now the only thing I'm going to make this away and make it to where we can stay clear with everything we as the church cannot pay everybody's bills I mean that's just you know we can't do it we don't have the money that's plain all right but you know but we've always tried to help everybody that had a need and you let your needs be known the Bible says and you can let them be known to the Deacons the Deacons will transfer that up the line coming on up to the things and you can talk it over with them and it'll finally come up to the basis through the trustees and own out if there's anything that has to be handled it will be brought down to the last two which is Terrance is the CEO of the church the way the government is set up I said the way the government is set up I'm the pastor of the church the way the church is set up so then that way we make the final authorities will be brought through into that basis so don't just say well what I'm going to remember it's gonna have to go through change to go up word code we may be all without a job it may be to the point that we're saying okay we'll give you 20 bucks get gasps to come church and we'll do the best weekend as long as we can but we can't pay you payments just make that plain and blunt we can't pay your car payments your house payment is that and you shouldn't expect it to be all right and for heaven's sake don't keep money in your bank account or in a joke out in the yard anywhere you put your money you know what I'm saying you can put it in the you know everybody looking at my jug in the yard you know I'd be good on the internet but the old-time way was to take a fruit jar and put it in the fruit jar and set it out in the yard and hide it that was the bank you had you were banking on that fruit jar holding it and some of you're old enough to realize that that did happen in a lot of cases but we're not able to handle everything so you shouldn't expect to come and ask for help if you have money in your bank account in any form I said it with minute minute Wes said it any form if you got it in the you know bank account you got it in and all of these other things that can be done don't expect somebody to pay your bills for you if you have money in your name that shouldn't be a Christian attitude all right so don't just don't ask that shouldn't be in we're talking about things when we have need to work that we have to handle things we have over the years here giving a lot of people money to come to church you know just taking maybe some are still doing that I don't ask questions but you know we expect to do stuff like that we'll do it as much as we possibly can and keep it as straight as we can but keep it to where we can can be able to handle it so even anything that said repeat now everybody standing up so you're not believers White's if you want to go to the basement feel up free to if you want to wear face masks feel free to if you want to do those things if you need it and all like that do it if you have a need then let us know through the chain you can come through the Deacons it can come up the chain up to to myself and into Terrence to where that we can help if you need it but remember just make sure that you don't hold up money and and keep it in somewhere hidden there are some secret bank account you know to where that it won't be done okay let's see I've got it wrote down because that would have to come through all of it has to come through once we're sitting of the way we're doing it everything has to come through a channel upward and come through the Board of Directors to where that they can handle things but the final decisions will be brought down to the life's to this there'd be Terrance in my cell so that'll be you know you won't be nobody won't having to do anything we haven't we'll do it out of ways everybody understand that's it's not something we're just saying this because we don't know what's gonna have we may have to cut I told the brothers always told the missionary brothers we still hope we still do our missionary as much as we can we will we'll send money to the missionaries as much as we can but I told them to start with they'll come a time when we can't send it so don't burden us about trying to get it because we don't have it see we have to take care of our home first everything here and then we can take care of other things later okay all right any other things that would be said remember now to the ladies this coming Thursday you will be headed that way this coming Thursday we will be heading that away so what the men so don't get it mixed up and getting the wrong car okay we have to have everything running in order so all the men to be going that way and all the women to be going that way another that'll take care of it we pray that you'll have a good time in in doing and you know and enjoy it and just pray one for another because we have it we always have had a good time to where we can get together with the brothers if you can't come up come on up you know one evening or up and eat with us on Friday we always have the big old thing about six o'clock on Friday we'll have a table covered half this room and you can just eat all you want to you know and have a good time together and then you can go out and go fishing and things like that huh that'll be up to you what you're deciding to do because remember me and go that way with the boys women go that way with the kids Irene I say that cuz some of the little ones are you know we'll have to go that way be boys too so just make sure we get it all in there all right father we thank you for this day and your grace unto us and we ask you to just bless us with your understanding that we may walk in you forgive our sins and Lord just help us and guide us be with us in this day you promised it so we believe that we've never been concerned about what's going on because we know you promised you'd always be with us you'd never forsake us you never seen you your righteous forsaken or the seed begging bread we don't have to worry about it you'll take care of all things because it's all in you because we're we are the body of Jesus Christ and you'll take care of your body have your way now as we speak - about your word you come and open our eyes to that understanding Lord that we may see you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name you mean quetions one brother lluís will be speaking Lord within Wednesday so we'll get that all right this may turn out to be because it's already turned into two services so we'll see how it's going to work okay visions one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ what is the believers position heavenly places according as he has chosen us in him that was what we were on last Sunday can't earring on with her thought chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will he may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word as I said there last Sunday I think it's still a good idea to do I came in today done my usual routine Terrence doesn't know he comes behind me does it too but all the doorknobs all of the rails coming up and down everything is wiped down with stuff I think that's a good idea I mean I don't think it's any problem I think it's a good idea you say well we ought not be sealing to will then go drink alcohol you know don't be silly let's go get you a bottle alcohol drinking some of it don't worry about it you know what I'm saying say let's don't be silly let's be brothers and sisters in Christ and let it all work out for the glory of the Lord okay now I've got a little something now got to explain because of the lies message but I hope you understand is right Aaron What did he say Wednesday night don't take what I say take what what I mean okay see last Sunday I made a lot of slip back and forth because that message was an injection I had notes to go in another way and it turned out but I kept saying to begin with that Paul and Peter had you know they never had no differences well I still true I wasn't freaking about Paul and Peter but that was in my mind and it just kept running and Paul and Peter did have a difference but it was never a difference in doctrine so what I was a saying was right so take what I meant the Paul and Peter had according to the scriptures they had problems there and Paul had to rebuke Peter but brother Brennan said they had no problems in doctrine everything was right he said that proved the whole thing you know God can keep us together all right but then see what it is is Paul and G and James was the two that I was bringing it forward because I was trying to explain the point of what I said we need to cover not to study in the Armenian in a Calvinistic form but to you know I don't really care for crossing that because you know it'll be fine we will to a degree but see Paul and James never had no contradictions you know no and I kept making mistake but I noticed in there so just without all that other you own the internet and it is you know just put that to the eight-year-old forget it but remember Paul and Peter did have problems they had troubles but nothing in doctrine you know that's what I love about that because that was too born-again Christians expressing their their point of view and thing and Peter just getting caught in a little bit of a natural thing you know that probably happens to us every day just about it and Paul said now Peter that ain't right you know you shouldn't do that but it wasn't anything to be derogatory to Peter that he was doing anything wrong it was just the fact that Peter wasn't behaving himself because really the story is he studied it is that they had this meeting they got together and they was a bunch of brothers together and Peter was over here talking with these brothers and associating with him but when Paul steps in Peter kind of backs away runs over kind of little Locker maybe that Peter was a little bit embarrassed at the time or something happened but anyhow there was no doctrine and Paul said okay now Peter that ain't right said because what she was doing while ago before James and myself and these others coming in because James was the one caught into not this James now that we're talking about in the book but that james r was called the legalist you know he was kind of a turn legalish but he was one of the Brethren all right so then he said now when when we came in said you run away from these brothers well they're just little embarrass and he said you shouldn't do that well Paul never said it well I mean Peter never said worried about what Paul said he's a matter of fact he bragged on him he said no Paul you gotta watch him cuz sometimes that he says things hard to be understood he said a lot of them struggle to her own destruction trying to do right but what were we talking about James and Paul James is counted by mankind as being more of the legalistic Armenian side of works all right show me that your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my works okay right now Paul was more counted by I'm saying it the well meaning now by mankind he was counted more or less to be a Calvinist because it was more you know on God has done this it's taken care of we don't have to worry about it all of this that and the other but I kept making the statements but I didn't read them but I want you to think about it because maybe you wouldn't understand me to say it but I looked like one thing is going one way and one going another but remember if you keep them going that away don't forget this Calvinism and Arminianism is both in the Bible the scriptures for both of them all right now and they're right in what Paul and James said what they were teaching was right he said no no no no no you're not listening what they were teaching is right what you think they were teaching is where the wrong comes in what mankind thinks about it because there was no contradiction between James and Paul well James wouldn't it was an Armenian that no no James wasn't an Armenian Paul was not a Calvinist it's what we call him to be we credit that to me we say that Paul was Calvinistic in his teeth Paul was not Calvinistic in his teaching remember you're dealing with two born-again believers faith of God statue of a perfect man at least up to what it says and the headstone hadn't come yet but at least at that point you gotta count Peter and Paul and James and John and order those up at that position because it was the faith of the fathers so James was a born-again believer and what he was saying was right see that's what's hard for people to say is you said but now he was Armenian no he wasn't I mean Ian he was a born-again Christian faith of the fathers saying what the same thing Paul was saying the same thing James was saying James was saying the same thing Paul it's a way of saying it that's worth it after I'm warning you and I that that's the easiest way for us to get messed up and I believe that's what's wrong with the people of this message trying to follow the Prophet because they take what they wanted the quotes and they run it down the line they'll take what they want of the quotes and they run it down another line I don't believe in that I never have I've always been maybe that's mean I'm sorry if I've ever had any ministry whatsoever it's in the one line that have always been tore let's take this and this and see it come together and when we do we've got a revelation because now listen Calvinism by itself is wrong I'm gonna fixing to read it to you arminianism by itself is wrong it's wrong I mean I'm who runs that is wrong but when you put them together in the middle of the road you got a revelation right so you know let's let's read that if we don't get into the main part of the message we will at least get this cleared up but let's go go ahead to number one brothers and let's get started on this at least clear this part up right here because I want you to this is what I want you to see all right he says I'm taking the Bible and say anything here like the church says the Holy Ghost was for just for the group back there you can take the Bible this point what you can make it say what you want to but if you take the Bible in the wording of the Bible and correctness you can't make it say what you want it just like it's you twisting what you're reading you're not reading the Bible the Bible is not contradictory okay so what the church says so in the scripture says whosoever will I can't make that hit the target I can't make Calvinism just believe on the Lord and you got eternal security now he said I can't just go that way well yes you'll hear a man explaining but that's exactly the way you come to salvation it's believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that brings you to eternal security but what's he saying just believing in the Lord if you I can't make Calvinism like mankind believes it to believe in the Lord he rolled it up mr. Hurley I can't make Calvinism just believing the Lord and you got eternal security and Arminianism that if I just touch not handle not taste not I'd like to do it but I can't do it he said I can't take those two because one is going one way and one is going down that's right now watch what he says he's got I've got to see where they both got scripture but it's got to hit the target work now in the middle okay Arminianism is too far away from Calvinism and they both are wrong okay now we're reading what a prophet says Calvinism is wrong our meaning ISM is wrong yet and we're gonna read where he says they're right all right let's see Calvinism by itself is wrong our median isn't by itself is wrong uh-huh but just got to hit the target and in the middle and when it does I say it this way but I can prove back up what he said see to me Calvinism proves Arminianism is right okay you're not listening to what I'm saying you're listening to what you think I'm trying to say no see arminianism by itself is wrong because it leans totally to works all right arminianism is wrong excuse me arminianism is wrong go to leanings work Calvinism leans to call it we call it grace but yet put them together the ever born-again believer I'll say it this way the deeper depths that understanding to bring you on into here until it depends on the fact of whether or not we can look at these things and come out with the right point and that's why I said it Paul's not a Calvinist he's a born-again Christian James is not an Armenian he's a born-again Christian both of us got truth but put them together and then they don't contradict each other right see which one are you I believe in works don't you I thought our works wish to follow our salvation I thought we were supposed to be Christians and live right now you're coming to the middle of the road then you're coming to the basis of seeing that Calvinism by itself won't work I mean it is more but put them together and you got a born-again believer who's serving God out of a pure heart cuz listen to what you probably has to say going into the next one cuz we'll hold that one faith without works is dead first thing it looks like Paul was speaking to the Romans 4th chapter just to find that it looks like he was justifying Abraham by faith and James is justifying him by works but it does not contradict well now you got one quote up here that he says well I said what's broad said he said there's wrong well they wasn't wrong we were the ones wrong well then when the Prophet comes forth and says James and Paul wouldn't contradictory see then I believe that but yet if you go across the street over here you'll find one or the other prevalent and do it and it's like I said I I listen to my own services I did twice this week so see if make sure I get things the way that I need to get it I made a statement in there that's probably a lot of you didn't think too much about but you know that ever born-again believer starts as a baby you start as a baby your babes in Christ according to the Bible right the Bible says we're babes in Christ well you don't want a baby in a legalist because you know yourself you used to things people go walking by on you you know you're looking at it and well they're not a Christian but then town goes on and you kind of get settled down and you see things and you say well you know I didn't I shouldn't have thought that about that person because I'm I'm in a sunshade we'll see a baby looks at everything legalistic I don't do this I don't do that I don't drink I don't know I don't well alright but see that's where God allows things I guess to happen to work maybe it fits in a situation but you see that's what I've been told to ever since we've been in this message we don't do this we don't do that we don't the women don't cut to her they don't paint their face they don't well that's great it's a if it's from a born-again experience if not it's just something that's you know that people do so we're either legalistic are we Armenian one of the two so we better consider it I'm not preaching to somewhere else I'm preaching here in Lula anybody else to listen that's their business I'm talking here are we Calvinists ether we Armenian I want to be both because both of them how scripture so I want the scripture all right listen to what the Prophet is saying like Abraham by faith James is justifying him but works but it does not contradict Paul was speaking of what God saw in Abraham and James was speaking what man saw in Abraham both of them looking at the same man right one of them sees him and thinks he's a little bit too much on the legalistic side the other one sees in thanks he's a little bit too much on the gray side but I'm gonna say this now whether you like it or not I think if it'll come together in the middle you get a revelation and listen I'm gonna say it now if it don't come together as being one thing you do not have a revelation that's as plain as I can be whether you like the pawn or whatever that's just the way I've always been I believe your works is supposed to prove what's inside of you I believe that I believe you should live a Christian life we have failures and problems right we do wrong all right if we hang to the Calvinistic we're gonna miss it see if you know how something really know if you keep leaning on the Calvinistic and keep doing wrong then you gonna you're gonna be lost cause you're gonna lose yourself so we better believe it make the right way to say it but that's all right forgive me lord give me something else we better depend on getting this much of that word that's right over here on Armenian is I mean get that right and get this over here that's right on Calvinism and give it right and put them together the work won't be contrary one to the other then that way we we can say hey wait a minute you mean that we have a right to go out and do it no no no no Calvinism never talked to her Paul never told that she had a right to go out and live like the devil but still claim to be hey be a safe Christian that's what I'm trying to get you to say he never taught that that's what man says he told well we can't figure it out called Paul says it's and James says it well why can't you say both them saying the same thing they're not contrary one to the other now you can see that when you get a revelation of a true born-again Christian a true born-again Christian lives each day in their life not trying to do things to please God no don't don't try to appease God there's no need what could we do time we get through trying to feed them and something devil don't come up with something else don't worry about it just be a Christian you mean now your sisters don't cut you higher does that mean you're saved no but if you go cut your hair off it could prove your loss okay okay is that true see we're gonna prove what we are you know see that way you don't have to make yourself do or not do and then you would in no way say well boy I'm glad I didn't do like brother Dale did because I don't know where God would have saved me if I'd have done what he done well I don't believe you would cause none of us didn't do nothing worth any time I mean the whole thing the whole nine yards you better believe in a little bit of grace now don't be into disgrace because that's us badness we went into disgrace with it and I'm not throwing off on them just saying what it was they said once saved always say we've ever said we're gonna be safe well that would be true if you truly was born again but if you're not saved then you're gonna go back to where you come from gonna go through the wall of the Mater my slob uh-huh but you see that's what I'm trying to get us to see are we Armenian or are we Calvinists or do we have enough of each side of it to understand I believe brother Brennan's message what's the putting together of those signs when they say imagine divorce he says he'd go so far out this way he says you fall off he said you go so far out this way he said you fall off he said come back to the middle of the road and just be a Christian they all right let's get the next one number three they learned the message that I word now Paul was justifying Abraham by faith James justify didn't by works Paul said Abraham was justified Romans 4 by faith so James comes over and says that he was justified but worse now both of them one confirmed the other remember who started off he said they're both wrong all right you take Calvinism by itself it's wrong you take arminianism but I say that's wrong put them together you got a revelation in the middle then you can see why that we do have an advocate to take our place but yet we don't use our advocate for I've always told you you know an angel will have to apologize to mine when I get there cause I've done wore him out he probably had to call in help for reinforcements you know because and I don't mean that jokingly I mean it's truth we're just human beings sure we make mistakes we do wrong but that don't mean we're lost so are you getting to which one you're on which side are you on well Brazil you've done that you're lost where does it show that in the Bible you got to get them both together seeing one of them will confirm the other one it's confirmed make it an established I put it into order or bring it to where it's supposed to be all right Calvinism is right we believe in doing the things and not doing the things we believe in it that's a Christian we don't live like the devil in turnaround say I believe in Paul's Calvinism now Paul didn't have that kind of Calvinism that's what I'm talking about Paul never taught Calvinism that away that's what we take you mister being teaching neither did James teach this you could be saved because of your works works is faith expressed we're supposed to be a Christian we're supposed to live like Christians act like Christians we're supposed to be a Christian not to have to well others don't understand you because you go one way then you go the other way well I'll give you the pulpit one day you want it come in just plain it I don't mean that jokingly I mean it right see if they don't both come together how can one confirm the other to your faith that you have in God is confirmed in the basis of how you live the way you live confirms what's within you are shows what's within you and sees in that way I don't have to worry about it you say what about us children I don't know that's what I'm trying my best to explain it to the children and all of us but I found out a long time ago that the older children is one you how the trouble trying to explain something to you like that or love it the older ones are the ones you have trouble trying to explain it to the children they just take what you say then they realize well hey brother Dale he he says a lot of things that are crazy but you know what he loves this and he tries to help us and he does everything for us and he's trying to do this he's trying to do that he's tried to be a Christian before us I believe that I believe in just being what you are I don't have to make up nothing I don't have to get up in the morning say well I'm a Christian so I got to act like one today I would I'd differ but I gotta act like a crucian cuz I'm expected to know I get up saying lord help me this night but I know I'm gonna stumble and fall so you help me and so Lord take care of it then it not the last thing I say Lord I'm sorry for all of the day and what I've been go to have it been right and haven't done what I should have done and I should have done this or should have done that but Lord forgive me and help me then about three hours later he wakes me up and he says well you forgot this you ain't never done that you never had him to wake you up remind you you know well sometimes that's why I get a sermon and it reminds me all right what do you see what I'm talking about you can take brother Brandon's message and make it say what you want it to say because they just gave you a quote that brother Branham says Calvinism and Arminianism is wrong then it gave you a quote where he said that they didn't contradict each other didn't give you one where he said that confirmed each other tell not trying to live a Christian life that's that's always been my pet peeve to say people say you know that they trying to brother they're trying to get you to little critter now he's trying to get me to do that like Fred Hooper said years ago you remember when that happened down there with the Jim Jones and the things that a little brother Fred hope we used to go to church and we start work one day and this man come up and he said the only was talking about the Jim Jones situation and he looked at Fred and he said his brother Dale ever want you to kill yourself he said ever service he said he tries to get me into whoever serviced to kill myself and live a Christian life alright that should be our goal see we expect God to take care of us like tons of troubles like we are now we expect God you know the world and all to take care of us and help us that's good but what if he's expecting us to move a little closer come a little closer to him you know all of these things serve him more honor him more especially yes I see do you have to make yourself do things do you have to make yourself do them see then you're trying to lean towards Arminianism you're trying to find some form of works that will save you work will never save you my brother Brennan said you can have what you women there's not cause you got long hair and long dresses maybe he didn't make the statement I'll make it you could you didn't get that Crystal Gayle ever what her name is and let her walk down through here and her hair is gonna run but does that mean she saved no well she don't go to hire does that mean you're safe because you don't got your heart if it is your Calvinists do you understand this if you think that you can do something or not not do it and God would save you or or whatever if that's what you're thinking then you're trying to to bring some forth and that won't work I'm trying to bring a boat to a point I think we order to live a Christian life I'm gonna state this way but I hope you and always have made that statement about brother Brown never had to come to teach the women and not cut to her and the close to her you Pentecostals now come on get on with it I'm 80 years old but I didn't come through Pentecost but you know yourself the Pentecostals they they've believed in that long dress long hair and men with the long sleeves and the nothing they was dire and that was robbed brother branham didn't have to come to straighten us out on the fact of what we thought that meant it's where he came he came to set in order all of those things to show us that it was not a Christian because that we had long higher but to show us that it if that if we do that by the love of God within our heart then the higher and all is the honor and glory see that way we're not legalist we're not trying to be saved I think if you'd agree with about the biggest portion of our lives and then we try to get out of being saved the way we've acted now at least right but you see Church what is it so you never chose him let me get to this part of the message just a little bit you never chosen him he chose you yeah but but but brother Dale I chose God I pray that cry I've tried to explain that here we go over here for a little while and then over here for a little while all right you cried and you prayed and you saw God the Bible didn't tell you you're wrong by doing that but then it said you never saw God at any time now you said wait a minute now you're over here one time and you're over here one time well why don't you put him together he chose you the way I like it really is the way the scripture says that man that's the title we'll use for a while he's chosen us in him whose to him that looks like there's a person standing there that looks like there was a person accepted and now you're in that person and you're accepted we don't want that struggle chosen us in him who Jesus Christ you see we're not trying to tear engines we're not you know not trying to be but if we get into the predestination in the correct order and bring it back all the way to where you can get to the mind and then look at that from the mind and maybe it'll help us to understand but what about it what is your goal now remember if he chose me I didn't having to do with it that's what I'm trying to explain I'm trying to be human to where you won't misunderstand and say well I don't believe this and I don't believe that I wanted to I believe that you saw God because I did I cried and prayed and fasted and and done everything and tried for that and gotten away from the world and the bad distant even this that much in the doctrine of the Baptist Church that I didn't drink didn't smoke didn't shoot and do those things I didn't have to quit that when I come into message come on you know yourself what I'm talking about most people say when I come into the message I quit drinking I quit you know I didn't have to because I believed it's a Baptist war to be a Christian I believe that one doesn't the Baptist Church were little Christian huh I didn't do it I didn't say that I said I believed in it that's why that one of these days you will wake up and realize that brother Dale is try this best to do one thing I've never tried to beat you in to believe in something I've never tried to make you believe in anything in Jesus Christ I've tried to make it to the basis that it is in the Word of God for you and me and it's in there in the correct order arminianism is Dyer Calvinism is there bring them together bring them together to word that we can see Christianity and it really is it won't be a hard life to live that's what I told the people in this message they told me said what do you mean you seeking the Lord I said I've been seeking the Lord two years and they found him yet I said that's after coming in the message will you believe the masses I see I think so-called I read six books and listened to tapes in one day you ever tried it I didn't mean it sarcastically I mean it's the truth I put my life dedicated it to study in this message that was all I had that was all my desires brother Kali can tell you I had a good boss and a good job and and everything and I can just set up there with him half the night he's up by rolling tires and meeting him talking about the Lord and he's rolling tires and stacking them up at a good time what you see Church I'm not trying to appease God I never did dad I just didn't want to smoke I didn't want to drink I didn't want to do those things why because I believed if I was going to be a Christian the first thing I said when I was 18 years old and you know I said well if if I'm gonna be a Christian I need to know what the Bible said so I set out to read it and I admit when I got to those things that were you good 1,400 times that it said so and so begat so and so and so and so begat so and so you'll run into them you ain't you ain't read the Bible through you can't read the Bible through well you don't know you never read it through you're laughing about it now because you realizes that's what you read that so once over got sunset songs over God's run so now I got tired of that but all at once one day right in the middle of it you know one of those 10 times reading their twenty all at once they was just something that was placed in there and it's like heaven wow look what I demystified have turned over and had the cat than reading this one so we got Chandra so I slowed down and I read the Bible and I tried to read it for myself because if I don't believe in Christianity for myself I was gonna believe in it in the Word of God I did I tried to do that and my wife's you can verify the point I told her one day I said look like to me there's gonna be two prophets coming for the end of the world I was a bad just reading that out of the Bible cause I had Malachi thread Malachi 4 well I wouldn't read through that I didn't see nothing well okay I'm not going off on you I'm just saying that's what happened to me then I read and heard it look like who here's one coming and look like over here's another one coming I told you about it when brother Moe got to talking to me about a prophet I said cuz I was kind of little bit tricky stew and he started telling me about a prophet and he was talking about Malachi forward I said well okay explain Malachi 3 well I thank God I didn't have to run up on somebody didn't know what I'm talking about I'd run up on a man and note exactly he quoted exactly straight through and he said this is Luke 1:17 and this is this and I said come on see once he got through explaining Luke and explaining those things about the coming of Elijah sound was well settled I was in the word I had my answer of two prophets looking forward to one coming but looking and seeing the other had already come I didn't have any trouble with those things you know why cuz I'd read the Word of God well how many times have we put our lives on the basis of how much we've read it's like I said if I was gonna be a Christian I thought all to know what the Bible said yeah shouldn't that be what it is well I begin to read it to see what it was I've told you so you get into this message in and you mentioned adoption then this messiness just as how Buddhists about it or predestinate has really gone off the other imagine divorce is really man you just out you nobody knows anything about all these thing well I know a lot about a lot of things for I come in this message cuz I'd studied it over and over then what was you trying to be Armenian or Calvinist matter of fact I didn't even know what neither one of them men I think that about the basis of all those sitting here biggest fortunate people don't even know Armenian of Calvinism you say it like anything what is it one of them is Calvinism it's trying to find some beautiful thing or something you don't or didn't do or something that's that the other some reason for God to save you our meaning is omit some works you've done thinking that's what made it to where God would save you but both of them is wrong that away we'll put them together what do you got put them together you got a beautiful story of the plan of salvation that God gave you and I an opportunity chosen us in him who him the word he said well that meant this person accepted this person over here and if within that person why no no don't don't get into that's your going into your your regard deals at the end and stuff like I don't do that just think about it but I ask you one time why did he save you well he saved me cars are so good what's the I'll just tell you right up front that ain't salvation nothing like you missed it I'm just serious I think you missed it I think you need to get saved Oh no matter how you ready Rhetta no major oh you're beating on me hard you're saying that I ain't say you that's what one brother said I said no brother I didn't say that you told them my ones I didn't say that I said if you act like that you're proving you ain't safe that's now you quote me riding I don't care if I act like the devil then I know who I belong to well what a wonderful opportunity to be able to understand these things maybe that encourage you to read a lot more the message you know encourage you to read and listen to a lot of types and get a good understanding of what's being say it because I think for certain if anybody should have the right maybe I don't shouldn't say this but better way but if anybody has a right to understand the Word of God it should be the people of this message I don't mean this cause you read it I mean because of why you're reading it at least some of that dwelt in it some of that caught in to us and hung on you know like I said how many of you would have talked about Armenian and Calvinism as I have today afterward that I can stand here and take a profit and say he's right but say that he said Armenian and Calvinism was wrong then he said they don't contradict each other then he said they confirm each other you show our master no cause you see if you'll just wait on God you'll just ask him and wait on him he'll come out and explain it to you they'll all come to the right place and you'll see that way Lord forgive me because I have had Armenian ideas I have had Calvinistic ideas I don't have to tear it out of the Bible that's what a brother told me one time he's talking about something he said they will take that out of the Bible I said give me your Bible cause you don't think it ought to be in there don't take it out give me your Bible he wouldn't do with it he knew me I don't take it out I'd have been glad to borrowed him another $50 $100 Bible replace it but I was gonna take that out of that Bible called he said it wouldn't be in there I was doing it call to him what you see we try to make things to be what we want him to be instead of letting it be what he says it is chosen us in him the word and he chose us before the foundation of the world yeah but now wait a minute you getting it to a little bit too foreign Calvinism well if we don't act and live like our Christian duty in our life here now we have no right to say we're Christians right we are no right to say we're Christians if we don't act like it see Paul then he's telling you what God saw in Abraham James is taking the same thing and explaining what man sees and put it together and you got the Christian experience of living for Jesus Christ every day you live and having a wonderful time about it then your fears and things are gone Rodell did you have any fear when this came on us with why because they ain't nothing they can do and what I could put you in jail any minute brother branham's wonder said it I love it he said you can't get sick unless God lets you you heard that one he said he allows it to come on here and he said this for our good but he says now he ain't gonna let it go too far what do you pray then brother Dale I pray lord help all these people around the world you promised the little bride that you'd be with her nothing wouldn't be able to conquer us you promised so believe that Lord help these poor old people of the world you don't ever pray for them lord help these poor little people around the world the trapped are dying and what about it okay I hope you get the point so where's no native trying to move on me and I'll get next week that's one thing about preaching you can just carry it on to the next service and don't go again but do you understand think about it are we Armenian are we Calvinist are can we take the truth they were presented passo Paul brought the truth about salvation James brought the truth about salvation we try to figure them out and we have them fighting each other they are not fighting each other Paul is explaining salvation as the gift of God that your predestinated that you're chosen in him not of him you're chosen in him well who was doing the choosing who to God himself you don't have to have another person to add up to were chosen in him who in God what about that well that means I can go I do what I want to now you're proving that you're lost you're leaning to your Calvinistic form and you're proving you're lost let us take the truth of all of it and bring it together that's why I love this message you know yourself I'm not saying it and Ron why we're saying it in a rally you know yourself you can read one thing run around and say yes and the next day you'll read something sound like it's different if you admit it you used to do that with a Bible you used to read this in the Bible and then you'd read this in the Bible and you had it contradictory but then come to find out it's both of them is telling the truth now it takes a revelation now that takes an understanding to come together salvation is of the Lord Jonah - or not we get into predestination just remember this one time he predestinated by foreknowledge but now you've got some calling an election we'll have to eventually get into calling an election that's where we look at it we thank predestination well that this means predetermined that's it if he predetermined me before the world I can be saved if he didn't I can't be then your prophet said you're wrong he said he didn't prove didn't choose by his own choosing city chose race for knowledge what you don't want then according to that now let's just make one little thing and I'll quit according to that then let me be a little bit on the Armenian side and this say I thank God that he has revealed its Word to us and we can do and realize that it's not what we do or don't do but yet if we're Christians we will do and not and then that'll make it come out to the rabbis and then we'll realize that hey it is a hall of grace but we don't want to make it disgrace and bring it to a baptist once saved always saved I come through there I know the doctrine but I'm not throwing off on them because that's what we thought and I'm true I believe it what's truly born again you're truly born again I believe in it I believe the Baptist had it right they just didn't know how to explain it this Baptist was predestination or do you know her or not so that's really technically whether the Baptist split over two brothers that was preaching on predestination and it divided the Baptist Church up in a descent it never Direction me but they had truth those people had truth I mean do we look at Martin Luther as fact that he was so confused about everything but God gave him one little thing the just shall live by faith no if you want to come to the house I'll see if I can find I'll find what John Wesley and Newt they're both was teaching things that we think brother Brandon was the one that started teaching them no they were teaching truth back down through there in a lot of areas but we want the truth they took this message to bring the truth this message puts together Arminianism in Calvinism and this brings it in a beautiful picture and we say thank you Lord for saving us now I ain't trying to work nothing out but I'm trying to just do one time let me be what I'm supposed to be and forgive me when I fail because I'm gonna do it Bank on these things let's Dan come on musician you want to study a little bit study on predestination and think about but you just remember it all starts from chosen in him starts there some reason that he chose you why don't you search for there's some reason I like it this way there's a reason for you women don't have to worry about preaching so that solves that right you don't worry about it comes from women not smoke sprees so you solve that well I find a woman I'd be happy I say thank you Lord at least I know once I got out to preach go seek when you come through Pentecost do you had a bunch other it was preaching and everything out and that's alright I'm not though - but you think there's some reason that you're here today well I guess we got up and I go to church that's good there's some reason I like what the Prophet said he said when the bride realized who she is and what she's here for he said she'll be an invincible army you just realize somebody chose me I didn't choose him he chose me he had a reason because one of these days you see I'm going to preach on a predestinated eternal gift that'll go with this a predestinated eternal gift what is eternal life it's through Jesus Christ and he's the word well we got ready oh [Music] you have a name he's come and believe and see [Music] right Morningstar [Music] and good to be here to be able to look like and see see faces [Music]
