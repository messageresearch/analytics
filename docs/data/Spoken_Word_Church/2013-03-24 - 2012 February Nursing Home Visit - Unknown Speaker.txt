is is he shall is away oh is is oh is jesus christ with all my soul he's just so good to me he was so thrilled of me i don't know why i was 100 from god when i first got saved and i fasted and prayed and i didn't know nothing about fashion but i just thought it i would do about food that god blessed and we started from there and i always had a hunger for the lord to see the lord i want to see it oh i want to speak look up on his face and her to sing forever and one day we'll see him face to face face to face with him saying that for years that he's coming but one day it'll happen it'll just happen and you said well it don't look like it happened it's going to happen and it's going good to be ready anything in your heart he loved it he loved it so much he gave himself he gave himself a random word off of us and i just fell in love with him when i first made it there and that opened that night and if you were here tonight and you don't go into the free part of thin you only couldn't start studying yeah because you know the prophet says that that we say well we've been said jesus is coming for years he said some people don't say one day it'll happen and then it'll all be over but where will you be uh it ain't the point that people hadn't come yet but it becomes what would you be doing will you be praising his name would you be ready to go if you're not here that you don't know the lord jesus and the three partners then i'm not trying to preach and i'm going to preach it but you better get ready because we're in the end time that's right that's wrong with that for you we're living here for you that's right yeah it will happen it might look like it's not going to happen but it'll just happen and this happens that's the way it is you know a lot of times we're not expecting our people to die and all that once maybe a heart attack hit them and they're gone just that maybe you a lot of people don't believe you can backfly you can get cold and then different right but you need to keep on the foreign land of god i don't mean to talk so much oh where rivers are is is jesus is hey is is is it is i shall not breathe i shall just like the trees foreign is i me by the way
