[0:34] alright alright let's go in
[1:11] we're in chapter 2 of Hebrews thank you
[1:14] all for being here we we already talked
[1:19] about something so we're not gonna go
[1:20] those let's go to verse 11 and backed up
[1:24] and went to verse 14 but let's go to
[1:25] verse 11 what can't increase chapter 2
[1:32] for both heated sanctifies and they knew
[1:35] are sanctified are all of one
[1:40] you turn everything on yeah but I need
[1:44] to make a note right here with notes for
[1:55] mojitos sanctify that they are saying
[1:57] goodbye to all one because he's talking
[1:59] about Jesus Christ for weeks cause he
[2:01] has not ashamed to call them brethren
[2:02] because what happened while we were
[2:04] talking last Sunday verse 9 but we see
[2:09] Jesus who was made a little lower than
[2:10] the Angels see what we're talking about
[2:12] in our illustration here's the here is
[2:16] eternity of this way and here is time
[2:19] down this way right now the creator and
[2:22] the creation began in eternity and then
[2:26] when the fall happened then we had time
[2:29] alright so this is an eternal line here
[2:31] of those eternity is always up here to
[2:34] hope of God he was the son of God the
[2:36] Creator the one to create and what did
[2:39] he do is is when the fall happened he
[2:41] had to this man despair God had to
[2:44] become a flesh died to take away our sin
[2:47] because least I had my new sending their
[2:50] flesh they didn't send her soul her soul
[2:52] is eternal
[2:53] they send in their flesh alright
[2:56] and it was animal flesh someone asked
[3:01] one time I kind of want to clear this
[3:02] out someone a small talent it's a good
[3:04] question someone said well why did God
[3:06] put us in this kind of flesh with you
[3:08] understand what a man with the organs
[3:10] and everything that we are the human
[3:11] male and female if he knew what we were
[3:13] gonna do well seeing creative evolution
[3:16] which we believe in creative evolution
[3:18] God created the animals first well they
[3:20] were procreating with a male part in the
[3:23] female part before even up in here when
[3:26] God created the heavens in the earth and
[3:27] created everything before the sixth day
[3:29] when he created animals they were
[3:31] procreate and they were having babies
[3:34] okay but what happened when God he took
[3:37] and just put up this is not this is sure
[3:40] this is human flesh but this is animal
[3:42] flesh this is animal this so what God
[3:45] couldn't God couldn't get away from the
[3:47] pattern of a male female dog the male
[3:49] and female cat mental female this so
[3:51] when he took Eve out of the side of Adam
[3:52] he put her in a female body of flesh
[3:56] according to what he had already created
[3:59] in the animals and he put Adam in male
[4:02] flesh from what the male party is of the
[4:06] animal kingdom so he and then remember
[4:09] the everybody's trying to find the
[4:10] missing link we all were in school
[4:13] trying to find the missing link when we
[4:15] know what was that beast oh god in
[4:17] creative evolution he creates creates
[4:18] great grades up higher higher higher
[4:20] fifth day creates the beast in the
[4:23] animals we created the beast which is
[4:26] the Matt one between McKean and man all
[4:29] right he gave that species but
[4:34] human-like body we say human my body but
[4:36] really work this is just this is flesh
[4:38] animal it comes from animal you know we
[4:42] know we're human no you don't get me
[4:44] wrong but in creative evolution God pit
[4:46] and create mentally mMmmm female and
[4:48] then that's with no way to reproduce but
[4:52] we weren't supposed to reproduce that
[4:54] way who's supposed to reproduce by the
[4:57] spoken word which come from the inside
[4:59] this guy right here is all male no doubt
[5:03] son of God is a male he's a man he's not
[5:05] a woman
[5:06] in demand alright but you know it
[5:08] doesn't take a woman for him to create
[5:13] he created without sure we were all
[5:16] inside that they wouldn't allowed but
[5:17] they're one that's the two people
[5:18] standing up there it was one Creator God
[5:20] but when he come down here
[5:22] in human flesh to take away the sin
[5:24] first he had to come through a one a
[5:27] human one to take the same curse away up
[5:30] even from the womb all the way down
[5:32] alright so so it's not and then like the
[5:35] other man said when we go back to that
[5:37] theophany body which is inside of us
[5:39] it's not going to be it's not going to
[5:41] be for sexual pleasure or anything like
[5:44] that it's going to be the spoken word is
[5:47] the original seed sure God's got a bride
[5:50] and we all are feminine in nature but
[5:52] that person inside of us is not a girl
[5:54] in person inside was a man Christ Jesus
[5:58] in spirit form now again and the son of
[6:02] God that come to the church ages but he
[6:05] had to come down in flesh because what
[6:07] this is man blood son of man is man if
[6:11] God was blood then I got that that's
[6:15] what the son of man that's why brother
[6:16] Graham could not beat thee son of man he
[6:18] was born sexual birth no one born sexual
[6:21] birth is good no one period so brother
[6:26] Branham was not the Son of Man Jesus
[6:28] Christ the Son of Man because he was
[6:31] born without sex at all men you and I
[6:37] were in every spawn a total in the
[6:38] Philippines I see you look around us and
[6:40] I might be an American you I feel
[6:41] Filipino you might be a lifter that we
[6:43] come the exact same way no one came
[6:47] different we all come by say every
[6:50] person on the face of this earth I don't
[6:51] care if it's artificial insemination it
[6:53] came by the act of a male or female they
[6:55] had to be an act of something being done
[6:57] so but not with this man so this is the
[7:01] son of man but he had to come back to be
[7:04] the head so at least be the body he had
[7:09] a physical body on earth but he took
[7:11] that physical body over into another
[7:12] dimension and now we're his body were
[7:16] the bride we're the bride where the body
[7:17] is us all right which makes us like
[7:21] mother Dale's preaching and we are in in
[7:23] time we are these not a man as a
[7:26] collective body of believers we believe
[7:29] that now God is trans
[7:31] forming from the inside out changing us
[7:34] into that form this inside of us that's
[7:38] why that I don't say does it Joe the
[7:43] people like sister cleaning the ones
[7:44] that are heading toward their end
[7:46] seemingly in their older age there
[7:50] there's that close to their debacle
[7:52] until they took a change you say no
[7:55] they're gonna die on one thing cuz
[7:56] there's our live time they don't step
[7:58] over in another dimension
[7:59] yeah be more alive than they are here
[8:02] because in here you got pain and
[8:04] suffering and all that stuff but over
[8:06] there there's not so I just want Christ
[8:07] came let's see it was made lower than
[8:10] the Angelus no angel created by God can
[8:16] be a son of man or a son of God okay
[8:20] angels are created beings for worship
[8:23] now they do make a choice because Satan
[8:27] made a choice those guys that I made you
[8:29] perfect Ezekiel I made you perfect until
[8:34] iniquity was found in you so he made a
[8:36] choice and part of the Angels made a
[8:38] choice to go Satan that's who's
[8:40] bothering us now the part of them did
[8:42] okay so they do make the choice but they
[8:45] aren't they they're not ever in flesh
[8:47] their their worship beings they're
[8:50] actually God's helpers as we read in
[8:57] verse one are they not all ministering
[9:00] spirits sent forth to minister for them
[9:03] that shall be heirs of salvation who's
[9:05] there of salvation we are we're the only
[9:08] ones that are the heirs of salvation
[9:10] right mm-hmm
[9:12] that I can see today you understand what
[9:14] I'm saying but you're giving an angel
[9:16] the Prophet to God told us yeah aim to
[9:18] have birth to take care of you now
[9:19] that's not your theophany I've heard
[9:21] people in the nation's preach to that
[9:22] was in no way your theophanies not
[9:25] maintain your being often it is you your
[9:30] theophany is I don't understand that I
[9:34] really know I don't understand that that
[9:37] that God gives you a God gives you a
[9:40] spirit I think what that is that spirit
[9:42] being the inside
[9:43] you it somehow it has to be once this
[9:50] come down here because remember Jesus
[9:52] Christ when he was born he was Almighty
[9:55] God he didn't have a spiritual being of
[9:58] no one else okay
[10:01] his nature was the nature of God but
[10:05] remember when he was at now that didn't
[10:07] make when he come out of the crib he
[10:08] stood up and started speaking no he was
[10:15] for a lack of words he was encapsulated
[10:19] in him in a human body and could not get
[10:22] out he had to be to be our brother and
[10:25] he had to be born just like we are in
[10:27] that way not not my safe but by that way
[10:29] through the womb but when he come out he
[10:32] was Almighty God about 50 was Emmanuel
[10:34] God with us all right but he had the
[10:37] growing grace of knowledge the Bible
[10:39] said he had to he had was made per being
[10:41] made perfect why because he was
[10:43] encapsulated by that humanity then he
[10:46] come into all right but now see that's
[10:49] different for me you we weren't born
[10:51] with the Holy Spirit as our spirit we
[10:53] were born with a spiritual part of us
[10:57] memory reason conscious facing
[10:59] imagination now remember those things
[11:01] don't develop much until you're older
[11:03] you don't have you don't have a memory
[11:04] when you were sucking your bottle so
[11:08] you're developing that but now the soul
[11:11] is inside of you I don't know this
[11:14] little baby I just I don't at that part
[11:17] of donors name because remember the age
[11:20] of accountability is when you begin to
[11:22] make a choice of your memory reasoning
[11:24] conscious affection imagination because
[11:27] it's not bad for a five-year-old kid to
[11:29] imagine thing or use their you don't
[11:33] have much of a memory but my brother
[11:34] Brown said you put the five year old boy
[11:36] in the five year old girl in the in the
[11:38] bathtub give a shower they play with
[11:39] their toys and don't even worry about
[11:41] anything else going on but don't put a
[11:43] fifteen year old kid in the 15 a 15 year
[11:45] old boy a 50 little girl in the showers
[11:47] you get a whole different idea I think
[11:48] huh probably yes you
[11:52] so but you face the same two people but
[11:57] what's developed in their mind is what
[11:59] I'm saying is about even with Jesus he
[12:01] wasn't he didn't come out of the womb
[12:03] quoting scripture yeah he wasn't Word
[12:06] made flesh he had to develop as a child
[12:09] now when he got 13 years old which I
[12:12] believe after her brother Brian kind of
[12:13] got his because listen you can't I need
[12:16] some accountability brother Brown says
[12:18] it's when you realize right from wrong
[12:19] that can be 13 or 30 and with some that
[12:23] and this is another thing say we can
[12:25] what are we getting in Bellevue well
[12:26] that's the only question you know but
[12:30] listen what about a one about somebody's
[12:31] now listen God didn't give a
[12:35] soul I give them perfect soul
[12:38] but what they were born into their
[12:41] genetic makeup some way and their
[12:44] spiritual being got messed up somewhere
[12:47] because God didn't put a slow learning
[12:51] soul or alimony bucks they were targeted
[12:55] but remember brother Graham said they'll
[12:58] go to heaven they have a special angel
[13:01] he said it a special angel is given to a
[13:03] person why because he knows
[13:05] that's going on he's gonna hurt him all
[13:07] through this life and that's why just
[13:10] for an example like like Donnie's
[13:13] brother Tommy he was hurt at Birth by
[13:20] five or six your goalies in the car car
[13:22] run over himself well he's been slow and
[13:25] not right well he's got a more chance to
[13:29] get to heaven then I told them did some
[13:31] of them brothers said that to think
[13:32] their religion he's got one good chance
[13:35] of getting into heaven which I believe
[13:37] you will because God said to a prophet
[13:39] then when somebody's like that
[13:41] we'll see that's not it his salts not
[13:43] but what happened to what he
[13:46] was living in was messed up okay so you
[13:50] see that's why I thank God brother Brown
[13:52] give us a definition of a body a spirit
[13:55] of salt and even told us that you could
[13:57] commit suicide and still be a born-again
[13:59] believer now but
[14:01] that don't fly in denomination
[14:03] denomination especially the Baptist
[14:05] if you commit suicide that's your
[14:07] straight ticket to Haiti there is no
[14:11] maybe trust me I've talked to them they
[14:17] said no there's no way no that's it man
[14:19] they just lose their mind yeah I just
[14:22] lost their mind and did what they did
[14:24] you know but thank God for a prophet
[14:27] they come separated all that out for us
[14:30] and gave us the definition of a body
[14:32] spirit result but Jesus Christ came on
[14:35] earth made his self lower than the
[14:37] Angels all right which we got there in
[14:44] verse nine he was made lower than the
[14:47] Angels
[14:48] why because an angel didn't walk around
[14:51] him in this dimension in human flesh no
[14:54] their spiritual beings they can move in
[14:56] and out they they're not completely in
[15:00] that box like I said before you and I
[15:04] got caught in the box when that really
[15:06] did what they did there's here you go
[15:15] you've got three dimensions and you're
[15:17] stuck in then you are stuck in three
[15:19] dimension laughs like matter for this
[15:23] radio waves and we can't pick up can you
[15:26] pick it away from your head now some
[15:28] people may think I bought it today but
[15:33] you think one of them let's go Christ
[15:35] when he came though he hadn't be stuck
[15:37] in them three dimensions here to be
[15:40] around right to be and to be our total
[15:43] example to even be the headship that's
[15:47] why we can't understand this guy here
[15:48] how can you understand it God that just
[15:51] what was he standing on when he created
[15:53] them don't matter he had to be somewhere
[15:59] brother Graham said he's not a spirit
[16:01] like that he's not like he's not
[16:05] spiritless just there's a fog just
[16:08] he's always been human or we were made
[16:10] Foggs just as one said let us make man
[16:14] in our likeness and then our image mm
[16:18] God's always been a human being always
[16:21] been a human being but what was he
[16:25] standing on when he said let there be
[16:27] over here this galaxy with the seven
[16:29] billion stars and let there be this over
[16:31] here but that same person came down here
[16:33] and human flesh so that we can
[16:34] understanding come he said I came from
[16:38] God and go back to God well there wasn't
[16:41] gravity okay there's been that somewhere
[16:46] but you guys I want to say that we could
[16:49] not comprehend that's why in the Old
[16:51] Testament there was no comprehension of
[16:53] God he was just this something so
[16:56] massive that that we couldn't understand
[16:58] him and even when he went when Moses
[17:00] went up on Mount Horeb
[17:01] to get to to get the word of the Lord
[17:03] you know remember the the people said no
[17:05] to you Moses you going up there and get
[17:07] it no God want to talk to all the people
[17:11] because he told Moses he said you bring
[17:14] your people to this mountain when you
[17:16] get out of Egypt and I'll tell them all
[17:18] of it remember what they said no Moses
[17:22] you going up and get them you know they
[17:25] were scared they were afraid of this big
[17:28] guy thank God but we're not because
[17:31] remember we can now come boldly to the
[17:33] throne of grace we come boldly to this
[17:35] what do you remember this man in spirit
[17:40] form would come down into the temple
[17:43] into the Holy of Holies and you can even
[17:47] look at him except use the high priest
[17:48] and you hadn't do exactly what was said
[17:50] or they drug you out there remember they
[17:54] couldn't even touch the are members of
[17:55] godly I mean one what about a nice guy
[17:58] like Thailand he sees the are getting
[17:59] ready to tip over and he reaches up push
[18:01] your heart back up God kills it while he
[18:04] couldn't break us a lot its lawsuit you
[18:06] couldn't touch ER but thank God we can
[18:09] touch it now we can touch this thing now
[18:12] subscribe because he this great one
[18:17] became he funneled itself down to this
[18:19] man called Jesus Christ
[18:22] right which is the son of man which was
[18:24] making over the Angels he took on man
[18:26] blood or man flesh
[18:27] listen brother Brown said Jesus could
[18:30] have had children so that means he in
[18:31] all functions he was a male all
[18:34] functions so he wasn't this elevated
[18:37] something well we know he was inside but
[18:40] he was in calculated like I said in the
[18:42] human body he obviously had asleep head
[18:45] they they had new things while but he
[18:49] sanctified himself remember I set myself
[18:51] apart i sanctify myself for this
[18:53] situation which is wonderful but we see
[18:56] Jesus it was made a little lower than
[18:57] the Angels for the suffering of death
[18:58] those remember he can't die here son of
[19:00] God
[19:01] never never never died the son of man
[19:03] died now when the Son of man died he
[19:06] released that that was caught inside of
[19:08] him which was the Son of God he released
[19:10] that life to go back into theophany form
[19:14] alright the oppening form is not some
[19:18] midst of rain it's a person God's always
[19:24] look like he did he never changed he's
[19:27] always like I said before he's always
[19:29] been a twenty year old guy always he's
[19:33] never been old yes body is real it's a
[19:47] real body it is not a we put your hand
[19:51] through you know Jesus even proved that
[19:53] even in a glorified body when he came
[19:56] back he walked through a concrete wall
[19:58] yet he ate fish right remember he
[20:02] appeared in front of them and then
[20:05] disappeared out of their sight you know
[20:07] if you have anybody that eat a piece of
[20:09] fish and it didn't hit the floor it it
[20:10] went somewhere God got a stomach yeah
[20:13] I'm stone you'll how it's done you're
[20:15] human but now remember there is there is
[20:20] a connection there because remember
[20:22] those people across the curve
[20:23] the time said we don't eat over here so
[20:27] you have to be careful they don't eat or
[20:29] he's remember they told him we don't eat
[20:30] over here what they're waiting to come
[20:32] back and get the body they ate in this
[20:34] body yes so they come back and get this
[20:39] body it meshes together makes it glorify
[20:42] just like Jesus did mm-hmm so that's
[20:45] what crowned him with glory and honor
[20:47] property God said hanging on a cross
[20:49] that's okay but when he come out of that
[20:51] tomb instead of all power in heaven
[20:53] earth has been given unto me no man had
[20:55] ever done that before
[20:56] oh yeah they've been people raised from
[20:58] the dead we know that but nobody had
[21:00] ever went from mortal to immortality
[21:02] that's what the Bible says no man has
[21:04] reached immortality except one man and
[21:08] that's Jesus Christ that's why my
[21:10] brother Brian wanted to see Jesus he was
[21:12] back up here in this dimension where you
[21:14] couldn't see him he was in the seventh
[21:16] dimension but he took that glorified
[21:18] body with it remember this body had to
[21:22] be made eternal Jesus Christ's body got
[21:26] an inheritance it was eternal life
[21:28] preached that many times before many
[21:32] times
[21:32] brother Brown says the eternal life that
[21:34] he inherited so he describes when he
[21:36] came on this earth as the son of man he
[21:38] didn't ever he didn't have eternal body
[21:43] he looked fifty years old he was only
[21:45] thirty so his body was wore out right so
[21:50] obviously that wasn't eternal but at one
[21:52] time when I was standing other day when
[21:54] he walked out of that tomb he didn't
[21:56] have that old body anymore he was a
[21:59] young boy that's my Mary Magdalene
[22:01] didn't know who he was he turned back to
[22:03] a twenty year old person he he he had
[22:06] connected back with a theophany
[22:07] that was inside of him that guy they
[22:11] said let us make man that's why he
[22:13] discussed it before Abraham was I am the
[22:15] I am was back there Jesus Christ put
[22:17] them back there the flesh man the I am
[22:21] was back there though this is he I am
[22:22] right here the Sun God see I am Moses I
[22:28] am that I am Jesus dead before Abraham
[22:32] was I am
[22:33] then you come over to Revelation 20
[22:36] I am the Alpha and Omega I am all these
[22:39] things alright that's what we're trying
[22:41] to get the people in Philippines to see
[22:43] we'll talk a little bit about today to
[22:44] see that now that if that guy is the I
[22:47] am then if he's inside of you ones that
[22:50] make you that makes you the I am I come
[22:57] from God I go back to God we don't start
[22:59] believing that we're going to keep going
[23:01] we're just gonna keep dying we have made
[23:03] ourselves a second person separate from
[23:06] God that's what we're dying
[23:10] you ain't hair and dress and no TV
[23:13] washing dishes and whatever you know
[23:17] it's a laundry death no well if we don't
[23:21] truly believe that now our flesh in hi
[23:24] flesh we are going to make manifest in
[23:27] another form called a bride we're just
[23:29] going to keep that because the son of
[23:32] man proved that the body change can
[23:35] happen this guy didn't need a body since
[23:38] I didn't need no change in he ain't
[23:39] changed since eternity but this man to
[23:43] come down to be your brother that flesh
[23:46] he was then had to be made eternal so he
[23:50] inherited eternal life in his flesh you
[23:52] and I may inherit eternal life in the
[23:55] flesh Jesus didn't come to grant you an
[23:57] inheritance no if he come to bring you
[24:02] an inheritance he had a beginning he
[24:06] came to return us back to our
[24:08] inheritance
[24:08] what God cut off was when this was went
[24:11] into time that could offer our
[24:13] inheritance of being spoken word
[24:14] children there has no one listens there
[24:18] has no one since Adam been a spoken word
[24:20] child except that man right there
[24:23] but by the word coming back in the in
[24:26] town in the son of man ministry to prove
[24:29] that God is now in human flesh your
[24:33] flash in my flesh that we can take a
[24:36] body change while we're standing on
[24:38] earth we don't have to die okay
[24:42] I committed to me that's the whole
[24:44] essence of this message the essence of
[24:48] this message is not hair and grass and
[24:50] being good that was way before brother
[24:52] Graham got here it was lost in the
[24:55] traditions of doctrine of denomination
[24:59] brother Branham came back to brother
[25:01] Brennan Jesus Christ came back three-way
[25:03] and ran to tell us that we are now sons
[25:07] and daughters of God we are the son of
[25:09] man made manifest we are God in human
[25:11] flesh
[25:14] brother brand a long time ago preach God
[25:17] in flesh and then maybe we wanted to
[25:20] head to India trip so he's outside that
[25:22] is it was his whole goal was to turn us
[25:25] back and to bring this revelation of who
[25:28] this man was that he's not appearing
[25:31] anymore sure he came back in the form of
[25:34] the Holy Ghost the Son of God to go
[25:35] inside of you but still that's not all
[25:38] because if he just got the Holy Ghost
[25:40] inside of you you gonna die I'm just
[25:43] gonna prove it to you it's happening
[25:45] already it's been happening brother
[25:47] branham's dead
[25:50] rotate them brother mode brother duncan
[25:55] i hold on sister doctor they've all
[25:59] passed on they're over there in their
[26:01] company having a wonderful time in the
[26:03] Lord and another dimension waiting on us
[26:06] to destroy death over here because why
[26:10] don't you come back into a place that
[26:11] they're still death and they will be to
[26:14] the outside world but in Goshen where
[26:17] the bride is death will be destroyed
[26:20] we're not gonna get anywhere but we see
[26:22] Jesus who'd make a little lower than the
[26:23] Angels for the suffering of death
[26:24] crowned with glory and honor see that's
[26:29] why I'm I think you know that's why
[26:31] Pilate didn't care everybody they were
[26:34] going wow this guy's wanting to make
[26:35] himself a king no the Jews this time to
[26:38] make yourself a king Pilate said are you
[26:41] trying to make yourself a king what did
[26:44] Jesus say he said if my kingdom was it
[26:47] this there in other words if my kingdom
[26:49] was of this earth you were
[26:50] now change you and how jams they said my
[26:53] kingdom not of this world policy hey Jim
[26:56] it's just a lunatic like the rest of
[26:58] them let him go let him play take his
[27:00] little group and go out in the desert
[27:02] you know and he'll just die normal death
[27:04] like that other guy did member the Bible
[27:06] said somebody took 400 out into the
[27:08] wilderness and they all perished well
[27:10] that's what Pilate was not fearful of
[27:12] hit Jesus that left the kingdom in his
[27:16] kingdom in Pilate Kingdom you understand
[27:19] that's why he said oh I find no fault in
[27:23] this man and then of course you know the
[27:25] Jews what they did they don't want him
[27:27] to be the king so anyway so that's what
[27:30] happened he by the grace of God should
[27:32] taste death for every man which he did
[27:34] it's not a man died God can't die but
[27:38] the Son of God inside the son of man was
[27:40] captured inside that body and had to be
[27:45] broken to be released and that's what
[27:46] happened to Calvary he broke open and he
[27:49] released the body into thy hands I
[27:51] commend my spirit
[27:52] no man till Jesus he died himself he
[27:57] died when he wanted to die he didn't die
[27:59] when somebody made him die he died when
[28:00] he wanted to die right for it become
[28:06] became him for whom are all things the
[28:09] Creator and by him all things in
[28:11] bringing many times on this glory which
[28:13] is up to make the captain of our
[28:14] salvation perfect through suffering so
[28:16] Christ was made perfect through
[28:18] suffering for both he that sanctifies
[28:21] and they they are sanctified are all of
[28:23] one they didn't say - this is one for
[28:28] which cause he is not ashamed to call
[28:30] them brethren saying I will declare thy
[28:32] name unto my brethren and then the midst
[28:34] of the church last thing praised under
[28:37] they and again I will put my trust in
[28:39] him and again behold I am the children
[28:42] which God hath given me for as much then
[28:46] as children as the children are
[28:49] partakers of flesh and blood that's you
[28:52] and me we protect numbers not eat we're
[28:56] potatoes when we were born we were
[28:57] flesh and blood he also himself likewise
[29:02] took part of the same what'd I just say
[29:04] baby was born in the womb he was a
[29:06] little baby he cried he had to have milk
[29:08] and learn to walk he didn't just come
[29:11] out of the womb quoting scripture and
[29:14] walking into the temple no there's
[29:17] nothing to talk about of him until about
[29:19] thirteen years old and then he goes into
[29:21] the temple and like I said I believe
[29:23] that maybe for a brother I'm kind of got
[29:24] the age of Kalin deal accountability of
[29:27] being about thirteen to sixteen thirteen
[29:28] to fourteen years old go there was Jesus
[29:30] in the temple talking to the priest so
[29:33] he had learned some things right all
[29:36] right so now let's sing with it share
[29:39] part of the same that through death he
[29:42] might destroy him that had the power of
[29:45] death that is the devil because when
[29:48] this happened and we stepped out into
[29:50] town we stepped into who's Satan's
[29:52] domain we fell that's why they call it
[29:56] the fall we fell from something but now
[30:01] what does redemption do though
[30:02] Redemption tation from whatever you fell
[30:05] to it takes you back to free fell from
[30:09] okay and deliver them that through fear
[30:14] of death were all their lifetime subject
[30:16] to bondage and it's still happening now
[30:21] that's been 2,000 years ago the same
[30:22] thing happening now right for verily he
[30:25] took not on him the nature of angels but
[30:29] he took on him the seed of Abraham
[30:31] remember he I think was the natural seed
[30:36] of Abraham Christ is the spiritual seed
[30:38] liquor because remember it says in
[30:40] Galatians not to seeds as of many but
[30:42] one seed which is Christ that one seed
[30:45] is come from the faith seed of Abraham
[30:47] not the natural genetic seed a natural
[30:51] genetic sperm seed will kill you I don't
[30:53] care what you where you put it and
[30:55] whatever happens we're dead in that
[30:58] that's what killed animes what's this
[31:00] list of having the liberal act primarily
[31:06] he took not on him the nature of angels
[31:08] but he took on him the seed of Abraham
[31:10] we're for in all things it behooves him
[31:13] to be made like unto his brethren us
[31:16] that he might be merciful and it might
[31:20] be a merciful and faithful high priest
[31:22] in things pertaining to God to make
[31:25] reconciliation for the sins of the
[31:27] people now there's no sin from here up
[31:29] this is the eternal line remember
[31:31] there's no sin up here
[31:33] he gotta bring himself down into sin he
[31:36] went born in sin
[31:37] but he was born in sin they sinful place
[31:40] he was not born in sin he was born in a
[31:43] sinful place hey why does his body get
[31:46] old because he was born in a sinful
[31:49] place the fall everything you fell down
[31:52] all right
[31:53] but remember like I said when he come
[31:56] out that tune he went no 30 year old man
[31:57] who looked 50 please
[32:00] Lord know that the offing inside that
[32:03] man was never got older than 20 years
[32:06] old that's why I believe brother Graham
[32:07] took that 20 years old the problem why
[32:10] God that listen God's not one
[32:13] millisecond older than he was when he
[32:15] said let there be life we just don't
[32:17] understand that but when he came down
[32:20] here and became the son of man we
[32:22] understand him more because now we can
[32:23] talk about going back to that parent
[32:25] saying well he's not he's not this guy
[32:27] never got old with this guy dead he got
[32:30] old because of me and you didn't get old
[32:32] but he needed to or what he to him he
[32:34] got old because of me in you
[32:39] wherefore and all things that behooves
[32:41] him to be made like into his brethren
[32:43] that he might be merciful and faithful
[32:44] and faithful high priest what to us he's
[32:48] not high priest by what she a priesthood
[32:52] opening eyes at 51 which one did that
[32:57] piece of do Peter
[32:59] Pete stop where did I believe that
[33:03] report who has declared who will declare
[33:05] the generation on their feet soon to
[33:09] become my faithful high priest in things
[33:10] pertaining to God Comerica
[33:13] for the sins of the people see we don't
[33:15] know what we don't understand is is
[33:17] Christ can do nothing else but what he
[33:19] did on the cross and what he did coming
[33:21] out of the tomb he can do nothing else
[33:23] beside that we just have not come to a
[33:27] position of believing that it's already
[33:30] done
[33:30] it's finished I mean there's really
[33:33] there's nothing that Christ is going to
[33:35] come back to do except get his people
[33:39] for in that he himself hath suffered
[33:42] being tempted arrested he was tempted of
[33:46] women Mary Magdalene was a prostitute he
[33:48] live didn't live with her you understand
[33:50] me but he lived in the same household
[33:51] because it flatters him Magdalene
[33:54] Margaret Martha thank you they all live
[34:00] together I mean they lived in the same
[34:02] area
[34:03] Lazarus yelled actors were there with
[34:05] mom you'll read you'll see them all kind
[34:07] of together sometimes you know so so I'm
[34:10] sure he was tempted but he is able to
[34:13] secure or to aid or help them that are
[34:18] tempted that's us
[34:21] okay that's ice now remember man put
[34:29] chapter 3 in there this is a continuous
[34:31] rhyming of Paul he's riding a lever and
[34:34] this is a continual riding because he's
[34:37] continuing his thought man put that
[34:40] chapter three of them
[34:42] so what's he saying where for what it's
[34:45] where for
[34:46] listen to what I was just saying because
[34:48] I'm gonna sum maximize this whole thing
[34:52] up right here wherefore holy brethren
[34:54] partakers of the heavenly calling
[34:56] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[34:58] our profession he narrows it down to one
[35:02] man Christ Jesus all of that in Chapter
[35:06] one and two it started off a chapter 1
[35:08] God willing sometimes a diner with
[35:10] divers manners spake to the prophets
[35:12] speak through the prophets now speaks
[35:14] through his son well he's your son
[35:16] Christ Jesus who was faithful to him
[35:18] that appointed him as also Moses was
[35:21] faithful in all his house for this man
[35:24] was kind
[35:25] worthy of more glory than Moses Michael
[35:27] he's Almighty God as much as he who have
[35:29] builded the house had more honor than
[35:31] the house Christ built house Moses
[35:39] didn't build house you understand what a
[35:43] man he built the natural temple but guys
[35:46] want to build everything else in other
[35:48] words you go back to the same thing
[35:49] about the the Potter and the clay how
[35:52] can we there's no way we can say you
[35:55] made me this way there's no way you can
[35:57] say that all right
[35:58] don't everybody's made with a choice for
[36:01] every house is builded by some man but
[36:04] he that built all things is God want
[36:07] khalida created he created all things
[36:09] Hey
[36:10] and Moses barely was faithful in all
[36:14] this house as a servant for a testimony
[36:16] of those things which were to be spoken
[36:18] after hour afterwards but Christ as a
[36:22] son over his own house whose house are
[36:25] we
[36:26] if being worth nothing if we hold fast
[36:33] the confidence and the rejoicing of the
[36:35] hope firm and to the end okay remember I
[36:41] told you one of my favorite scriptures
[36:42] he doing doors to the end shall be saved
[36:44] that's that's really a promise you got
[36:46] to endure to the end listen we've been
[36:49] in this thing a long time now and you
[36:52] say why wait well got no results well
[36:54] then you just not eat it maybe you're
[36:56] not part of the results maybe you're not
[37:02] part of the results if you don't see
[37:04] that there's any result or anything
[37:05] going on in your life then don't blame
[37:06] anybody else blame yourself yeah if you
[37:12] do what God said you might change the
[37:16] blessed
[37:20] but Christ is the son over his own house
[37:22] whose house are we if we hold fast the
[37:26] confidence and resourcing of the hope
[37:28] firmament to the end wherefore as the
[37:31] Holy Ghost that said today if you will
[37:33] hear his voice know what watch here is
[37:37] remember we talked about interpolating
[37:40] for those you work here it's not
[37:43] interpretating it's interpolating means
[37:46] it means that that you're going to stop
[37:49] just a second and and you're going to
[37:51] make this square for if you take all
[37:54] that take this out see that parentheses
[37:59] over there it ends right here so Paul is
[38:02] interpolating he actually introduced
[38:04] this itself to explain what he's fixing
[38:07] to talk about because look it's supposed
[38:10] to say wherefore wherefore wherefore
[38:18] take heed brethren lest there be any of
[38:20] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[38:22] departing from women cause that's the
[38:23] way it should have been written but Paul
[38:26] interpolates wherefore stop a minute I'm
[38:31] going to explain what this where forward
[38:32] is going to be wherefore as the Holy
[38:35] Ghost said today of you we hear his
[38:36] voice actually most of the time when
[38:39] Paul interpolates he's quoting you the
[38:42] Old Testament
[38:44] khalakka say it's actually an Old
[38:46] Testament scripture almost verbatim as
[38:50] the Holy Ghost said today if you will
[38:52] hear his voice harden not your hearts as
[38:54] in the provocation now what is that
[38:56] that's back in the of children of Israel
[38:59] in the wilderness they were provoking
[39:02] God that's what provocation means our
[39:05] rebellion and the day of the temptation
[39:08] in the wilderness when your father's
[39:11] tempted me proved me and saw my work 40
[39:15] years wherefore I was grieved with that
[39:18] generation and said they do always err
[39:21] in their heart and they have
[39:23] no no way so I swear in my wrath they
[39:25] shall not enter into my rest he's
[39:31] explaining what he one God's fixed in
[39:33] one God room told Paul right now I'm
[39:35] sure God told him to write this because
[39:37] it wouldn't be in the Bible if he would
[39:38] but that was the great Apostle Paul
[39:41] interpolating and telling us explaining
[39:43] to us what God has told him to write
[39:46] down cuz watch what did this talked
[39:50] about this talked about that generation
[39:52] we preach on this because what you will
[39:55] see in some of the things this afternoon
[39:57] the the theme of brother Royals
[40:00] anniversary meetin was the Joshua
[40:02] generation the ones that rose up and
[40:04] went over because the old ones did not
[40:07] they did not enter into the Promised
[40:09] Land now the promised land is rest the
[40:12] Holy Ghost is I promised land it's a
[40:14] type of what they went over into if I
[40:17] understand that one what the children of
[40:19] Israel went over into was the rent you
[40:21] know they went the old fighters all died
[40:24] it was only Joshua Caleb and the young
[40:26] people that were twenty years old and
[40:28] younger that started to journey well
[40:30] they had grown up and got older but all
[40:33] those old fighters had died God had to
[40:36] get rid of it cuz he told him he said
[40:37] they're all dead maybe Jesus didn't we
[40:40] man in the wilderness and Jesus together
[40:41] all dead that were damned is eternally
[40:44] separated they'd had to halt die off
[40:46] because why they were unbelievers Joshua
[40:49] Caleb was only to true believers that
[40:52] started the whole journey right they
[40:54] were the only ones who believed and then
[40:57] they got the other group to start
[40:58] believing all right look they shall not
[41:02] enter no my wrist so now wherefore take
[41:05] heed brethren lest there be in any of
[41:08] you an evil heart of unbelief see that's
[41:11] what I was trying to give us the see but
[41:13] he told palm to go back into the Old
[41:15] Testament and bring up a group of people
[41:17] that were known believers
[41:19] departing from the Living God that's
[41:22] that whole interpolating right there if
[41:24] you ever see that the parentheses that
[41:27] is Paul
[41:30] explaining what's coming up there okay
[41:34] with it
[41:37] take heed brethren lest there be any of
[41:40] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[41:42] departing from believing God but exhort
[41:44] one another daily while it is called
[41:46] today lest any of you be hardened
[41:49] through the deceitfulness of sin for we
[41:51] are made protectors of Christ if we if
[41:53] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[41:54] steadfast unto the end not let's go
[41:59] let's start right there next time
[42:09] [Music]
[42:17] yep that's where you're standing yep
[42:45] Aaron you take that back okay
[42:47] hit that button
