TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh the old we holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen amen appreciate the opportunity of gathering here in the house of the Lord this morning I want to hear you amen there you go thank you I you know it's been a while since I've been to Georgia amen and I wanna just uh I've enjoyed the Welcome that I've had here since I got here got a chance to fellowship a little bit with the Dales they're at Rachel's house but you know there's a longing in my heart could be with the Bride of Christ and it just it's just a joy to be here with you all so I want to just let's just start into the scripture but before we start into Scripture let's let's go before the Lord in prayer our dear precious Lord and Heavenly Father we're so grateful or God for all your for the opportunity of gathering in with your Brides or God the Lord Jesus as we humble ourselves our God not to just let you speak Lord God to our hearts Lord Jesus we pray Oh Lord God anoint myself Lord God that I would be able to get out of the way and speak to your people Lord Jesus let your Holy Ghost Lord God just manifest itself here Lord God amongst us once again Lord God we know beyond any shadow doubt that your pillar fires still here north on your word still here nor God your resurrected and you're here amongst us for Jesus and I pray O Lord God that you can just use the ministry Lord Jesus we believe in the ministry Lord God and we that you would use the ministry Lord God to just get out of the way there God yield themselves to you many a times Lord God we listen to the tapes and we see that brother Branham didn't even know what you're saying sometimes in Lord Jesus we we pray in the same way Lord God that you just use our lips or God to speak to your people we pray Lord God we but we ask your blessings Lord God upon us as we endeavor to go into your word Lord Jesus name Amen amen that's turning in the gospel the gospel of Saint Luke the 14th chapter and start at the at the let's see that'd be the 16th verse and st. Luke 1416 then then said he unto Him a certain man made a great supper and bed many and and sent his servants and sent his servants at supper time to say unto them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they and they were and they with one consent began to make excuses the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must need go see it go and see it I pray thee have me excused in another said I have bought a a five yoke I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come notice so the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house began being angry said unto the servant remember it says servant not servants said unto the servant go quickly unto the streets and unto the lanes and unto the city and bring hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servant said and the servant said Lord it is done and has that has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and into the hedges and compel them to come and in that my house may be filled filled for I say unto you none of those whom met those men whom were bidden shall taste of my supper a man s bar has once again our dear Lord Jesus were grateful or God first of all for your work and Lord Jesus we pray O Lord goddess we go into your the rest of the ministry Lord God I pray O Lord you bless us all in Jesus name Amen bless your word amen and I also read the it's almost a similar story that Matthew talks about Matthew 22 1:14 he talks about that same same incident when others had other excuses but you'll find out that the call to this gospel has gone out you know if you look at it that call went out when Jesus was there that call has gone out when Jesus came back in this day and age in the message of this hour that call went out to bring bring in those that were invited bring in the Pentecostal people bring in those that have that that are talking about the restoration of the gifts bring in those that that that understand that that that God is doing works like he used to do in the in the Old Testament I got a cough drop in my mouth so if I sound funny bear with me because my throat's not helping me much just work the same evening but so you find out anything flies please just don't let it hit your eyeballs one time I was preaching enough and I noticed a little bit of slobber going out and Isis Isis uh and quickly I just said say it don't spray it I'm sorry brother so but nevertheless bear with me just pray for me for my throat a little bit but there's water up here but let me let you know that that call went out that call went out to the Pentecostal people to bring them in to the to be the Bride of Christ but it wasn't in the Pentecostal people and the ministry so jealous of the of the power of God moving within the message of this hour within one man that they said how can this man lead us all how can this message be the only message out there you know and now it comes down to like one time I was talking to my dog my sister-in-law married to my my my brother-in-law Daniel and and and or just yeah that would be a sister-in-law and I she asked me and she asked me why I've made some mistakes here I called Joseph some more that he wasn't okay but I came down and I and she said how can it be that you're met that the message you're talking about is the only thing out there you know how could it be you must have a real big head to think that you're the only word of God that that's here on the land today I says I've been to many bunches of churches find your people than you are nicer people than you are more considerate people than you are and and yet you say you're the only church there is and I thought to myself like brother Brown said one time he says Lord when he said to that that infidel he said lord help me to be able to say something to her I said the same thing Lord help me put in my heart something to say to her in a and I waited a little bit and all of a sudden they started coming Isis you know that's an interesting question I said if it was that we were in Noah's day I said and Noah was standing at the door of the Ark bring on the ark every day in this family there and you're standing there looking at the Ark being built and all of science is telling you there's no such a thing that's roister up in the air in the atmosphere and you're standing there I says would you have gotten in the ark and she says of course I would okay I says come down to the days of Moses I says if Moses was what's calling the people out and telling them to give up the world give up the the fun things the joys of this of this world and come and be a separate people be at different people and it is served the Living God because our fathers worse was telling us through the word that were to leave Egypt under our strong hand in the mighty arm would you have followed Moses she's of course I'd have followed Moses this is okay I says in the days of Jesus if you would have been there and describes him you were part of the scribes and Pharisees in that religious order of that day and he comes and tells you follow me like he told the rich young ruler but yet he said give away all your riches to the poor and come follow me become a poor man like I am and come follow me would you have given up all your riches to follow Jesus Jesus of course I would this is okay now you ask me that question about the message of this hour I says we have come to a day we see the pillar of fire once again in our mist we've come to a day where God is raising up the dead healing cancers power the power of God's manifesting itself amongst us again I said and will you step out of your denominations because he said come out of her my people be not partakers of her sin and be part of this truth that's been given would you step into this message she says yeah I can see what you means but she did never come so we stand here and we look that many our bid many are called many are called there's a call gone out and there's a call gone out to the masses not just to the sick there was a healing service not just a sick you look at the pictures in all the all the books and you see the masses of people that were coming for the healing where are they where are they today where are their kids for their family they should be here they should crowd this church so crowded you couldn't fit another person in here they should be lined up outside my goodness this place would be packed out all the time why because there's a word of god that's coming our our but where are they the healing service is done by now there's a call to the masses there's a call go out to the highways to the corners to the calling them they'll compel people to come there's a compelling that's gone out now the Word of God is compelling people to come and now you come to a place where you're standing here and you start to think well how am I playing into this scenario okay so uh so we start to look at at the at the day we're living in now let's move over to another scripture you know there's been a let's go over to when you see where's my scripture Matthew 16 and 13 let's move over to Matthew 16 and 13 bear with me because I'm working with my wife's Bible which I'm not familiar with but it was smaller and it fit the suitcase back ah the C orange Matthew 16 mix Matthew 16 and 13 then Jesus came unto the unto the coasts of Caesarea of Philippi and he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said aunty and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some say Elias some Elias and others Jeremias Jeremias and one of the of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said unto him thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God well from a belieber standpoint yeah he could say that now I got a question for you if we take a look at the scriptures and we look at the different things that God when when they are where I wound does men say that I am the disciples only said a few things there was a lot more said about who Jesus was if you look at it some said that he was a bad man for he took a whip of cords and started turning over the money changers and excuse me turning over the money changers and I would take a I take that Oh turning over the money changers and and now and and and and sending out the Sheep and letting all the doves and and the zeal of his house what consumed him and you find out that that G the people that were that there scribes and Pharisees that were sending there says he's a madman he's a terrorist he's some kind of crazy man he wants to make a make everybody then then you say well and then then others said no well he wants to can bring division amongst us because he preached he said let the letter if you look in now if he preached saying that that in Matthew 10 30 feet that that turn he came to bring division he says he's going to turn it a father against his son and a son against his dad in a and a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a daughter against her mother and that's also in st. Luke out of Saint Luke 12 53 where it seems that he's bringing division amongst the people in this and they stood there saying he wants to make us he wants to divide out people unto himself and not be part of the religious organization we have here not part of Moses's teachings and some some said said in that day they said out well some said he was born in sin some son said that he was his mother was was was pregnant before she came together with Joseph and so she he was the illegitimate born in sin and the law says that and any illegitimate child can't even come into the congregation of the Lord so they said he's born in Sydney how can he how can he be a man of God because he was a virgin he was virgin born that's what we understand but they're saying no he wasn't virgin warned some said he was that Mary had gotten with some Roman soldier or something like that so you start to see that the testimony of what they're talking about God about our Lord they're they're giving out a bad testimony of our Lord and you start to look at who does man say to them they said he's blz Bob by the Prince of Devils he can cast out devil so you say well they're calling our Lord these things and you say well ah the opinions of man if we're going to stand by the opinion of man he's leading the people astray he's taking him away from the map though the message of the hour he's taking him away from the law of the prophets he's taking him away from the priesthood he's taking him away from temple worship he's taking him away from all these things they said that about Jesus our Lord but what did the faithful say the faithful the faithful man said one day he says he opened my eyes and I was born I was born blind he says nobody can open a man Matthew 2923 it says but if if this man were not of God he could do nothing so the blind man was was standing there with his eyes open saying this miracle can be nothing but the hand of God and you don't know where he comes from you guys thinking you know you can't figure out where he comes from and they said you're born of sin you come to teach us and they cast him out of the temple Isaiah said he's Emmanuel and by interpretation in Matthew 129 it says that means God with us believers saw him for what he really was Peter said right in that same scripture reading thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now becomes another question talking about the messages our hoo doos does men say William Branham is you know according to 2 Matthew 24:24 they say he's one of the false prophets because he you know the scripture tells us Jesus was giving a warning that at the end time there will be false prophets amongst us so they come back and say he's an antichrist or one of the false prophets that's to come into the world at the end time that's what they say about this message or this William Branham that came unto this endtime people they tell him all he's he's a powerful medium he's a mind reader he's a soothsayer they gave all kinds of descriptions to try and say that this power of God that was moving amongst the people they were giving all kinds of excuses to print it towards the demonic side but yet you see some people that saw something in that manner TL Osborn says I saw Jesus with us once again in the ministry of William Branham who really is William Branham the Bible the the Bible should be able to identify him and we can see him according to Malachi four and five that he's the one that will bring back the hearts of the children back to the Father he's bringing us back to the book of Acts and we're seeing that in our day and age the book of Acts once again portrayed amongst us and as we look at the ministry of William Branham we can see in Amos 3:7 that your Lord your God will do nothing least he revealed himself to his servants the prophets Cisse jesus said who do you say that I am and if William branham's would have said who do you say that I am where do I identify in the scriptures where is my place in this gospel right and over and over again through the different messages that we listen to we see him identifying himself is the word of God for this hour we see the the places where we see it now we start to look at the scriptures and we see that there's mysteries that have been hidden through the ages in the Book of Daniel Daniel 12 14 it says that that let's go over there Daniel 12 and for Daniel 12 and for there's no okay Daniel 12 and 4 it says but Thou O Daniel shut up the words it's in seal the book even until the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase see there's things that have been hidden through the ages that have been hidden holy script you know I reminds me of my mom you know I loved cherries we went and pick some bean cherries one time we don't grow being carries in from cially we grow the little pie cherries little things like that and the Robins get him most of the time so we never get very much of them but in their sour but we went down down to lower lands and found some bean cherries and we picked them and my mom doesn't pick just a little bit she picked tubs of them and and she can them all and she sealed those cans inside a pressure cooker those bottles inside a pressure cooker and every so often I would sneak into the pantry grab a bottle and grab a spoon from the from the the silverware and take off out to the barn and I'd eat all those cherries of that bought jar and all of a sudden I and I'd hide the jar back there and behind the chicken coop out there and all of a sudden mom comes out there and she is she was cleaning up back there and she finds that bottle and that spoon stuck in there and all the little pits and she says who got this you know who got this Daniel did you bring that out here cuz yeah Jesus why did you do that just I really like those cherries um and she says well she says I don't mind you eating the cherries take them inside the house put them in a bowl don't leave my jars out here and bring the spoon back so there's things in this word that have been sealed up for us in this day and age I didn't need to die in some of the Terry's when they were fresh but they were so good even when they were sealed up for a long long time and you know what the Word of God has sealed up power for you for this date and for this age the Word of God has brought things to pass he's he's preserved his word so that you can have a fresh taste of this manna the hidden manna that was preserved for you for this day for this ministry to give to you a faith that was once delivered to the Saints hallelujah so we stand here beneficiaries of the Word of God for our hour has been brought to pass so that we can so we can stand here and by faith look upon the Word of God and say this is for me I don't doubt that this word of God has produced the healing virtue that I have need of it produces the resurrection that I have need of it produces the power of God that I have need of for this day an hour that's why I can look at every promise in the Word of God and say this is my possession why because mama seal those cherries up for me you know heed father God seal this this word of God up for you for this day and age and we look at the Word of God and we start to see the different places that God has has brought the Word of God and shed sealed it up for the end time and now he's decided to open it up so it can be revealed to his bride to give his bride a rapturing faith he cares for us he knows your name he knows who you are he knows what you're going through hallelujah so we realize that as we look at the revelation of the seven seals revelations 501 it says that it was given for our day and age oh I hate to use this costing for blowing my nose excuse me recognize that this word of God has been sealed up through the ages and it's sealed up so that you and me a little kid running up through the the woods up there in osceola would come to a day that this would be a revelation to me that this would be a truth that can be revealed in my heart and then it can be manifested manifested in a people that will take him at his word hallelujah and we've come to a place when we start to look you know the question now comes up we know that Jesus when they said who do you say that I am whom do men say that I am we could have ain't going to give him a long list of things then when G when the believer said who do they say that he is they recognize them for who he was the devil's recognized him too but we start to look at who brother Branham was for his day and age although they called him all those things we the believers have come to a place where we recognize never a man spoke like this man it was Jesus's anointing upon that man that caused us to come to this faith that we now know and now looking at this truth that we're standing on we start to look in one more question the question comes up now when I stand here and say now who do you say that you are I stand here and I say who do you say that I am you say well your brother Daniel you your your your your minister it comes out of brother Manuel's Church out there in New Mexico and that's not that's true in a way they're very superficial but in truth when you start to look at who you are in the scripture who you are in the word you start to look at for the bride has made herself ready you start to look at the signs of the time that we're living in you start to look at the at that that Google car driving out there in the streets of California already of post completely by remote control and you start to see the Word of God is coming to pass brother man would sit there and look at Israel returning to their homeland and it would bring something up in him but a man would see Hitler's fall or Hitler's rise and then inners fall and it would bring something up inside him right why because it was not set the Lord that had come already now you're coming to a place where you're sitting here and you're starting to see that that does set the Lord every item is coming to pass science is advancing we stand in the in the in the day of a nuclear war we stand in a day when when the unite uniting of churches is is being pressured they've been telling brother Manuel he's getting letters and stuff telling him are telling them you should come to these meetings you're a minister you should be coming to these meetings these meetings are to unite the Brethren everybody has to unite you have to be part of this of this big what do they call it organization and of course who's going to be the head of it you know you know that the biggest organization is going to be the head of it Catholicism but there's a big pull to be uniting time there's a uniting time and it's of the denominations though the scripture talks about the parable it says the weeds are gathered first and then the weeks gathered the weeds are gathered to be burned and they're gathering strong there's a strong gathering pull together and that's listening to Trump on one of the speeches and he's talking so much about Catholicism how good Catholicism has been and all this and then I listen to brother Branham saying you know there'll be some Ricky like person that a woman's man they'll just sell out you know sell this whole thing out you know I thought wow could this be Trump I said my gosh I just you don't realize that you know that that the Word of God is going to come to pass you know when it is you know when my Kyah gay when elijah gave the prophecy about about a hab my Chaya came back and said that the angel oh Lord I mean that the that the Lord was asking who will bring this thing the Word of God to pass in an evil spirit came up to make it happen you start to look at it you start to look at all things all things work for the good for those that don't love Lord you know we have Joseph was showing me a and you know I work in a nuclear facility I work on the atomic bombs I know what's there and Joseph was showing me a film of the power of the atomic weapons being developed and I knew that they were way strong but you know to see them in comparisons the mushroom cloud in comparison Isis my gosh I says we one of these new new weapons that they have out there could crack this world right in half and send the pieces out to space I mean there'll be nothing left and this is in the end there and they're over there sabre-rattling out there and in uh in what is it uh South Korea and and and we're saying oh you dare try and do anything we'll bought nuke you you know we're not holding back this guy doesn't know what power is yielding right we know that he can't do anything until the Lord says it's time so we're we're standing here looking at the the day but you know what what we say what who do you say you are who do you say you are who do you undergo what does man say you are that doesn't matter what does the word say you are if you start to look at I'm the bride of the Living God I'm the Bride of Christ and I live for this word of god that he's given me in my day an hour that will bring me to a rapturing faith and the knowledge of who he is you know we're standing in the day of the Jubilee R we're already I mean if you look at 50 years were a past time of the Jubilee year but we as believers should be coming to a place where we're we we've got the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost inside of us is producing something it's producing a faith the kind of faith that was once delivered to the Saints the kind of faith that you'll stand there and say well silver and gold I don't ever what I do have I'll give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up to your feet we've got that power because it was given to us by the Word of God by Pentecost everything that was in Pentecost is amongst us today as believers as we hold as believers with some monsters today and we have a right to it don't don't don't you know what a pardon is not a pardon unless it's taken as a part of it and your faith has to be stand in the forefront so you say I believe that everybody here that has need of healing will be healed because it's God gave it to me in his word and I have faith in his word so I'll take this pardon I'll take what he did at Calvary he said by His stripes I am healed and I'll stand here and I'll say I'll testify of the truth that God's given to us in this day and age amen so we stand here you know when brother Branham said you know if you reject the seal of God you're taking on the mark of the beast we've got to be a people that know that we've got the Holy Ghost know beyond any shadow of doubt that the Spirit of the Living God lives within you lives within your heart stands at the forefront will compel your words to come out of your mouth even if you don't realize what you're saying you'll say the truth you'll say his word you'll confess his word you'll believe his word hallelujah so what happens so we stand here as a bride of Christ and we start to look at the places we fit into scripture for the Bible says the bride has made herself ready revelations 21 I mean really come and see the bride it says revelations 21 9 and you start to look back and it says for revelation 21:3 let's go back there and see it real quick we start to see scriptures that talk about well the bride has made herself ready you start to see the scriptures that that are fulfilled in His Word and revelations 21 3 it says then behold I heard a book and and I heard the great voice out of heaven saying behold the temp the the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and and be their God and then comes skip over to a 21-9 it says and and it says and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show thee the bride the Lambs wife do you identify with that do you stand here and say well that's that's not til after the Millennium that's not till after the Great Tribulation you stand here say I'm identified in the word that's my part I am the Lambs bride I am the Lambs wife and it's his spirit that has come down to dwell in me to produce what this message is calling for in the last days you say what's that a third pull what's that a rapturing page what's that just believing is word for your healing believing is word for everything that identifies you in the Word of God it's been sealed up and it's been held until this day to be poured out upon you hallelujah hallelujah earthquakes in diverse places it's a woman's world they want to control I have a woman boss and let me tell you it it comes to a day and age where you start to look at the people coming to a place that they take hold of the pillar of fire they may not be able to see it with their eyes but they know his president they can feel this president really Brown used to say when you when people will come up close to him is he don't don't worry he's just that feeling you got it's him it's just it's his power coming upon you right now you should be feeling that right now that's just ministry as his word is coming around you you should be feeling his presence you should be feeling his anointing identify as we close let's stand to our feet we look at that we look at identify if you identify yourself in his word that's you identifying yourself that doesn't really matter that much but he's identifying himself in you now that he's identifying yourself in you you come to the place where you say Lord not my will but your will be done identify yourself at me manifest yourself through me make me Lord God everything you want me to be in this day and age because I know that we're standing in the brink of your rapture I know the gospel is returning back to the Jews and Lord God the Gentile dispensation is about over and we want our children we want our lives we want every aspect of us to manifest Jesus Christ and him crucified hallelujah for we believe you let's bow our heads our dear and precious Lord we're so grateful Lord God for your truth Lord God in your word Lord Jesus we want a revival in our hearts Lord got every aspect on who wanted to manifest you Lord Jesus Lord God we pray Oh Lord Jesus you bless Lord God the people here Lord Jesus let your Holy Ghost Lord God take

you tell her brother how much we appreciate the message because we believe it the bride of Jesus Christ around the world the prophet has said it and we believe it when she recognizes who she is once she's here far in it she's his wife Caesars Brock why wouldn't he listen you realize that God will hear you quicker in here we'll hear an angel well because you're his child you think he's not going to listen to his children hears the cries he knows what's going on don't ever think that God's not listening he knows all about you but you know what he's doing sometimes is waiting on and see what we come to I think he's waiting for the bride to step out upon the word and confess who she is and believe it is that a hard time to think about we're the ones at the end of the world has come upon and and you've had all of those great ones back down through time before us into things we're going to go out of here just by haphazardly floating along you know I don't want my children act like that I wanted to believe and move on and go don't try what about he is telling brother how much you appreciate it with just remember now that tells you meeting for the pageant Saturday and just remember that and then remember brother Villanueva will be with us the Lord willing sunday ministering for just the Lord would bless him and give him you know whatever we have need up because that's what we desire you know what I've always said you want to hear something from God what the prophets say except you want to hear something from God he says God's obligated said here put somebody on the platform to tell you but now well though I believe if it was up now he didn't say that did he he took a dumb donkey one time and rebuked a prophet now what if the Prophet had it went right on the way he was going
