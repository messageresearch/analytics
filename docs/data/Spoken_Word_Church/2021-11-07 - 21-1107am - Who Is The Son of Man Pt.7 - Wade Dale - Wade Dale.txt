here the family's not here because he's not feeling well and then we had a wonderful time at bible study last night the room was packed full of people and we had a real good time in the lord we had some real good discussion in the bible study i wish y'all could all be there and help me a lot more on sunday morning because we talked about a lot what we're going to talk about today some last night so it always happens that way and also we will be having communion this afternoon after the second service communion and foot washing after the second service so we're getting back to where um to some sort of of normalcy so good to be in the house with the lord amen god bless you we love you with the love of the lord let's go ahead and turn to john 1 1 and we'll continue our thought this will be part 7 on who is this son of man because we really we really have not we've got him here on earth but we got to if the son of man is supposed to be the one that we that we characterize ourselves after we need to know what he is what he done why he came and why he's called the son of man not the son of god all right so let's go to john 1 1. just keep all these in prayer we'll announce them again on wednesday and then on sunday so just just don't forget squash casserole next sunday john 1 verse 1 let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us father you truly have given the cream of the crop lord this is your people the greatest people to walk on the face of the earth as we were talking last night we truly are blessed to have the truth not a truth not a part truth not what we think is truth but we have the truth and you are the way the truth and the life so we know that it's also we need to understand who you were while you were down here on earth the son of man lord and we'll see that lord that you were god made flesh and dwelt among us lord forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes lord be with the people that are sick richard roberts are different ones they're not feeling well lord we pray that you'd touch each one in our bodies lord send your healing power lord you said you sent your word and healed the people so may we get a revelation that we're all healed today father any ailment or whatever we have sin sickness or anything else lord we pray that you take care of that lord as we speak the word in your name the lord jesus christ amen in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god that's not three people the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him this person and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john we know that's john the baptist he was to introduce who not the son of god he was to introduce god in human flesh and we see a repeat of that in the end time god sent us a prophet the third coming of elijah was who john the baptist right william branham was the forthcoming of elijah the spirit of elijah and he introduced jesus christ to the world and showing that jesus is back in human flesh again in his people not in a body a corporal body because you can't have two bodies here at the same time on earth we already went through that all right there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light all right separated remember he was not the light he wasn't the son of man he was introducing the son of man but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now here we go with that's one characteristic he was in the world the world didn't know who he was all right same way he's going to be with me and you he came into his own and his own received him not he came to the world he came to the denominations he came to whoever you want to say and they turned him down they received him not i'm reading the bible but as many as received him thank god as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god not the son of charles and alla brown i'm not the son of samuel peggy dale not the son of wherever you come from flesh but as many as received him to him gave he power to become the sons of god as he was talking last we were talking last night he told nicodemus he said you've got to have a conversion from that birth to the new birth amen which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and here we go verse 14. and the word all this all this word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord added blessing to the reading of word just background just a few minutes we want to go to hebrews 10 verse 1 and read for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing remember everything that happened in the old testament was a shadow or a type of christ coming on earth and having a group of people and you and i it's an it's the example remember the bible says these things in the old testament were given to us for what example to whom the end of the world has come upon well guess what the end of the world has come upon the people and we've got to look at the shadows and the types because it was only a shadow because it was speaking of what jesus christ the true lamb of god not just a regular lamb that they put up on a up on a pedestal and and killed it and burn it and god said okay that's fine but i'm coming myself because watch for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comer there and do perfect so there was no perfection in the old testament it was only covering or capo it pushed the sins to calvary it wouldn't let you become a christian because you couldn't because you couldn't get born again you couldn't get the holy ghost the holy ghost was tied up in this man named jehovah all right for then would they not have ceased to be offered in other words one time and it's done no they had offered every year because that the worshiper once purged should have had no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year every year at any feast wherever they were supposed to go to feast of atonement they knew everybody had together they knew the priests had to take the blood off of the they had to uh kill the red heifer they had to put a lamb up for so many days they had all these things they had to do showing in type though that jesus christ was coming but they couldn't take away your sin that's right they only covered it okay so now watch what what is paul saying here but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins all right so it can't take it away it only covers it but what's he going to do wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings thou is not but a body a human mortal body the word was made flesh but a body has now prepared me they fell in human flesh in the garden of eden god had to come back in human flesh amen to get us out of this and we'll read we'll read it in just a few minutes we'll read a quote that's what god had to do that's what he wanted to do that was his master plan that we've been talking about for 40-something sermons on the eternal plan of redemption that eternal plan of redemption hinged on god not a second person he didn't send somebody that would be awful i did something and i'm gonna send josh to take my place no i gotta go do it myself i need to do as they say in in the world cowboy up they fell in the garden god said i'll put in me enmity between you and the seed of the woman in other words i'm going to come back in literal human flesh to take away the sin of the world so that's what john said and we'll read in just a few minutes he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world all right but see you and i we're not we're not looking at a second person of a trinity and we didn't receive the third person of the trinity when we got the new birth we received god or he's not god amen he's either god almighty and human flesh or he's an imposter amen because he said he was coming he said he was going to be here i am going to do this abraham i am talking about abraham's journey last night you know what about a man named abram he's just sitting around in in a little city called ur and he's helping his daddy make idols so they worship many gods right he was an idol maker his daddy was so he obviously had to help his daddy it was a family business but all of a sudden he hears this voice one day and i don't believe it was sound like james earl jones for those of you that don't know who that is he talks real deep you know everybody thinks god talks real deep now the devil talks that way too hello somebody so your god talks to you different than the devil does sometimes you can't tell the difference hello you just got to check it by the word of god you shake it by the word of god and you keep taking it the word of god because satan cannot stand the word of god but now he only added when he came to eve he only added one word he quoted what jesus what god said you eat that you eat of this tree thou shalt surely die all satan said was not thou shalt not surely die he quoted him 99 of the sermon and made one one little one word off threw everything into chaos so that's what that's why that we were saying last night in the bible study that i just believe that that are dumb enough to believe that that god's eternal god's perfect he had to have a perfect people so he could come back into those people in the end time with a perfection of the word of god outside of anything else that anybody else has any other idea or thought he sent the message to me and you amen he sent he god sent the message to me and you yeah now what are you going to do about it right amen you're going to take it and say well it's just it's just it's just part of christianity no come on folks that's not christianity out there they're trying their best they're doing the best they can but they're not living listen like i said last night we're the only people that do things halfway correct even though we are a little bit off and wrong in our humanity we baptize right there's that's the whole thing last night we were talking about listen there's seven billion people in this world let's just say three billion or four billion are christians and not buddhist or hindu or whatever that other is because they don't baptize right but you take all the other christendom roman catholic and just name them all they all have one thing in common they baptized in the name of the father and the son and holy ghost and the bible says the whole world is deceived by that they're deceived by that beast and that beast is what rome and their rome they the whole thing is is father son holy ghost they they deny the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ everybody does except just a what a small few people thank god we're part of that small few people that's doing it right it's not this it's not that well i do it because brother branham says come on people we got to get out of that i do it because brother brown says no i do it because that's what the bible says i don't curse that's because you know what the one that curses god left me amen and the holy ghost is there where it used to be amen same way with all of us if you're if you're born again are in your journey so let's read number one and the masterpiece everybody all right amen and then come finally the great head the head of it all now we're going to talk about that a little bit later we're going to talk about the headstone because look the headstone is not the son of god the headstone's the son of man god in human flesh he was the head of this new race we're going to read it later on he was the beginning of the creation of god that's what god wanted in the beginning is to walk in human flesh with his children with his family on a perfect earth yes you say how you know that brother wait because that's what was there before the fall and that's what's going to be after everything's restored god's going to walk in human flesh with his children on a perfect earth and thank god for the future home where brother brown says god's not going to annihilate this this earth he created it for people to live on his people these other people are just squatters what they're not part of the inheritance you and i are part of the inheritance if we're the children of god and then come finally the great head the head of all of it what if you look that word up that's that's the number one that's like the father of the head of a family he's the one that's the that's the head and everything else is below it same way with me and you he's our head we're the body right the head of it all the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarchs now see in the old testament but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all jesus came on the scene so in other words as we were talking the body was built by the old testament prophecies as we read in isaiah 7 verse 13 says behold the virgin shall conceive all right that's how got it started yeah it's how little that's how it got started a virgin shall conceive nothing's ever happened before isaiah walks out and says hey a virgin shall conceive goes back home and his wife says how. how that's never happened before he said i don't know said i just said what god said and now what a prophet does he says what god said that's right god tells him told him to say it and you know what he thought looked at his wife and probably said and it will come to pass it might have took six thousand years four thousand years after isaiah it doesn't matter he spoke it and that's what gabriel built his whole when he comes to mary he built everything on that right there listen if if jesus christ could resurrect on the prophecy of brother ronald said a backslid prophet david said i'll not leave my soul in hell or suffer my holy one to see corruption he said jesus went down to the grave believing that scripture so that's how the body was built jesus steps out on those old testament prophets because what does he keep doing listen he doesn't have a a paul an irenius he doesn't have these people to talk about when jesus walked on the earth he was in the old testament he talked about moses he talked about abraham he talked about isaac he talked about um elijah right because that's all he had to work with but he came exactly the way the old testament prophet said he would come didn't miss it by one scripture and they turned him down isaiah 9 6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given so there you go there's going to be a baby born a child is born so he's going to come through the womb of a woman he's not going to be just like boom and there he is he's not going to be adam like adam was created a grown man no because you weren't created a grown man you came as a baby so jesus had to come as a baby to be our kinsmen amen i know this is elementary but you know what pretty good to me for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counsel of the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end now i could see caiaphas and some of those high priests reading this scripture because they do read this scripture they read the they read the bible they write they have the old testament scrolls they read this scripture and they're going man when when the messiah gets here he's going to come right into this temple and he's going to say oh great caiaphas here i am because he's going to have a government he's going to bring peace because remember jesus was born under the rule of rome that was roman that was ruling the jews in jerusalem they weren't free people they were almost slaves right so confidence and all them are going like man you know and even even they're gonna say even uh john the baptist said oh he'll make the high places low and the low place is high he's gonna take the curves in the road and he's gonna pull him straight boy when he gets here well he got there and he came the way the bible said but he didn't come the way they thought he should come that's the same way with me and you folks if we're to live the life of the son of man it's got to make you different than the rest of the world like what bob was talking about this morning and what we were talking about last night this this message of the hour will separate you if you live it now see you can limit live a denominational life and you still smoke drink cuts and do what you've been doing now i know that because i've been around them people what do they get saved from i was just with one the other day and he's like i don't see anything wrong with having a little dream i said you're baptist yeah but i just don't see anything there's nothing really that tells me i can't do that and i started to say but i've got a little bit better than i used to i should have said your pastor should have told you that because it's in the bible it says that for you not to you this is the temple of the holy ghost for you not to make put anything in it that you can't use but i didn't i just kind of he said i don't know how you see it he said but that's the way i see it i said okay you're fine you whatever you want how you gonna change their mind because they're told when they go to church they can go in go drive down the road they're walking in church with shorts on baseball hats carrying their starbucks coffee now is that god no but you can't tell them that because they go to church but now listen like we were talking about last night are we though so blinded that we can be sitting in this church and have a laundry list of what we do do and what we don't do and that's your salvation no somewhere you look at all the people that are leaving the message somewhere there's a crack in that foundation and you start building something on top of it it will fall but if you've got the new birth that's right we were talking about last night the the difference in the new birth and the holy ghost because there is a difference you can be anointed with the holy ghost and i didn't read it last night but remember joel promised joel 2 said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh so everybody's anointed brother brown said you can't tell that woman not to wear a pair of shorts cause why she's anointed she's anointed with something false but she's anointed and you can have the holy spirit on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell you'll be just as black inside your soul as satan is yes that's the anointing the anointed ones that's the anointing it's the true anointing of god we were talking about last night but listen that's the difference in the holy ghost you can have the holy ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth you can't have that new birth down in your soul and die and go to hell i'll promise you that you've already been to hell because you know what jesus took his soul to hell preached to the people that were in prison come back up picked his body up and said all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me and in 10 days if you'll go to jerusalem and get up in that upper room i'll bring every little bit of this and i'm going to give it to you amen you love the lord you got to it's a perfect plan he it's perfect there is no way man has messed with it for thousands of years but it's perfect yes and the perfection is here not coming not a new message this is it but i'm telling you you can sit and die in a message church too just like they sit and die in the denominational church you gotta know that you know that you know that when you come to church that that was one of the questions how do you really know you got the new birth how do you really know well look at your life like bob's talking about this morning look at your journey from a to today amen because maybe five years ago eight years ago six years ago ten years ago twenty years ago you're sitting in a bar on sunday morning because you'd watch football all night and you had to sober up hello let's get down on earth or you smoked a cigarette or you didn't even go to church but look at you now you're here with a desire not here just because disguise the door's open it's a nice warm place to be we come here to hear from god that's what my soul feeds on is to hear from god [Applause] and and we were talking last night and and i'm probably i was the only truthful one in the whole building i said i have been to church and didn't get a revelation and everybody's going but i was the only truthful one of the bunch i have sat in church and not got a revelation but i promise you there was something to build on that a month later you've done it how many times you heard brother dale say something over and over again and you just i mean you just brain dead right through it hello and then all of a sudden though what did the holy ghost tell you he said i'll bring things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you amen that's his job and if he does bring it back that's the holy ghost that's something you can put a stamp on you can put a seal on satan will never do that he'll never he can't even give you a revelation he hates revelation amen but we love it so do you know you got the new birth if god keeps revealing things to you and keeps revealing things to you i'd say that's a pretty good showing that you got the new birth is that what responds inside of you not maybe immediately so that's going to help some of you going to go man i thought i was the only one who didn't get anything out of that service no there's several times that you don't get anything but i'm telling you god promised how many times have you read scripture and swore they added that about two weeks later because you didn't read it the first time you read it hello well it was still there how many times have you read a message book and you read it and i'm going to read this quote from the masterpiece 1964 the entire handiwork of god we find in him the perfect reflection of the word and you just read that book a week ago and you never read that it got added afterwards no it wasn't your time to get it you get it in your time you don't get it in brother zach's time your time your you get it in your time amen but see that's the way i know i got the new birth is that continues on and on and on even though you have a dry day listen we walked in the valley of the shadow of death we walked in dark places and where it was just absolutely like brother gary atkins used to say he said man he said three months and lord where are you at i ain't got anything in three months you know that's pretty dry but god didn't say he was going to talk to you every day he talks to you sometimes when you need it that other guy talks to you all the time all right amen i don't know how i got off on that but still maybe it'll help somebody that's sitting there today going i ain't getting a thing he's saying okay okay so if you don't that's okay but you know what god will bring back to your remembrance he'll give another preacher will be preaching somewhere maybe three months from now you'll hear somebody on the tape you'll hear brother branham and you'll go that's what he was saying well that's a revelation satan is not going to give you that he's going to try he's going to try everything in the world to keep you from watching that person online or listening to that tape but if you connect with that see that's god connecting with god that's the new birth it's god connecting to god because what is in your birth it's jesus christ inside of you in the office of the holy ghost not another person or a different person all right well i'm not going to get finished with this all right let's go to isaiah 53 real quick if i don't we'll get this afternoon i want to get to i want to get to a port apart right here first i was isaiah 53 who has believed our report how many of you believe what the report is what is your report the report's what the bible says the reports what the preacher says if he preaches the right truth amen and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed or the power there's power behind revelation that's why satan hates revelation more than anything it's because you get power from revelation i do you should get power when when when you have an aha moment oh that's what that meant well then see that stuck with you your entire life if that's a revelation from god it's a peace that fits somewhere in the statue of a perfect man and if it fits right the bible says fitly join together that we grow up into god if it fitly joined together there's no cracks satan can't get in the crack because he's going to try he's going to try to get into crack that's why you got to have the holy ghost first in your soul as we were talking last night that seals you until the day of your redemption then you've got growth development after that because you know what brother brown talks about the boxcar we didn't talk about this last night but he's got the box car you got product in the box car you got a guy that packs it full you got a guy that seals it but it's got to get to its destination or the product is no good so it's got a what a journey but it's sealed until the day that that gets to where it's supposed to go so it's a journey your journey and listen if you haven't grown any this year or or in even in the past let's just say a year if you haven't grown in a year i'd seriously consider maybe trying to get the new birth i just said we couldn't grow a lot but i'm i'm giving us a year bro bob 365 days now so i'm kind of giving a little bit of grace for all of us if you're not better off with god than you were a year ago you got a problem let's just let's just look at each other look at yourself in the mirror and say look i got a problem maybe i ain't born again maybe i'm just struggling around here in sanctification and that's okay cause the unclean spirit goes out but there's the spirit gonna come back in i'll promise you and fill you with something cause you didn't get it sealed but you need to get if you get it sealed then it come what may it can rain it can rain on that uh box car it can get cold it can get hot but the product inside is going to stay there same way with me and you all right free shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he has no form or commonness in other words he's not a good looking guy and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him wouldn't you think i mean if god was coming down in human flesh it'd be the best of the best we would think caiaphas thought that way look at the roman catholic church they put everything they got in what beauty beauty beautiful this or or even denominations they'll say boy we built this great big beautiful church and it's got usb ports in the back so we can plug our phones in and we can set our coffee and they stay warm in this little warmer right behind the seat and y'all would probably want warmers in the seat or air conditioners in the seat that's right sister i know you would but it would be have to be controlled individually because some of you would turn it up and some of you be this and you turn it down and some of you be going in here yeah so anyway that's the convenience but see that's beauty there was no beauty that we should desire him there was no beauty in jesus there was a lot of times jesus was walking around and people didn't even know who he was didn't know who he was remember the bible says he disappeared in the crowd why he just looked like the rest of them because even one time they said it's not joseph's boy saw him in a carpenter shop ain't that joseph's boy no that wasn't joseph boy that was god's boy amen he is despised and rejected of men so now look this is the characteristic of the son of man in the end time we're promised the manifestation of the son of man in the end time which is god in human flesh so if this is the way he acts that's the way we're supposed to act no different he is despised and rejected of men so don't worry a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief had a lot of friends leave us haven't we when we come into the message and come into the truth and then as we get more truth we have a lot of our friends that were in the message with us that don't even want to talk to us no more hello somebody right when jesus went to the cross when he manifested the son of man he was by himself no one was around him to help him they ran and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our grief and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god you know even when he was hanging on the cross caiaphas and all them were looking at him and they said oh he says he can save the world and he came save himself you know what they were saying god our god our jehovah has now passed judgment on this man that thought he was god look at him hanging there that can't be god hanging on a cross naked condemned to die and hanging there under the cruelest punishment you could get i'm sure they were like you know grab their grab their coats you know and they're like we won't ever see him again god has passed judgment on this man because of what he did he just ruined our denomination he just ruined our thought process oh little did they know little did they know that was god but he was and you know what confidence is going to see him again at too white throne judgment but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed you need healing today read that scripture for yourself but he was wounded for wake dale's transgression i almost you get emotional when you read that because that's what god did this is so simple salvation but that's what god did for your whole journey and remember he had to come in human flesh because you can't whip the son of god son of god can't die we're going to read here in just a minute what the son of god is going to do because he gave his soul a ransom but he gave his body a sacrifice just like a lamb he took the stripes on his literal body for me and you that's the lamb of god that john introduced that takes away the sin of the world but remember it wasn't the box not the body that saves you the body of jesus don't save you the body of jesus didn't come back into you in the holy ghost it was the soul of god the son of god the genesis 1 26 man that was before the foundation of the world god amen all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all did he not do that he didn't have a lot of fun when he was on earth he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth we were talking about that last night we're having some people having trouble around here with temperance and tempers and all that stuff how many days but what about a man though listen what about a man he was every wet man right he would stand before caiaphas or he would stand before pilate the pilot says you king he said to this end i was born but see pilate realized that this one man was not going to hurt him he had the power of rome behind him he had 10 000 soldiers he had all the latest equipment and here stood a man didn't hardly have clothes on it wasn't a threat to pilot because pilot what pilots say he said i don't see no fault in him let him go if he's got a kingdom he can't fight me but that man remember he said i could call how many legions of angels to make this all go away you talking about statue of a perfect man you talking about not my will but thy will be done try that sometime try that when some soldier is going to beat you half to death with a cat of nine tails and just drive drive i'm talking about pushing a crown of thorns in your head they didn't just gently lay it on there and said oh you're the king no i'm sure they took that and probably took a piece of leather so they wouldn't get stuck their self and they pressed it down in jesus's head and you know what yet he opened not his mouth he didn't revile back that's what's supposed to be inside of you and me he was oppressed flicked yet he opened his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears dumb so he opened not his mouth didn't say a word he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation we've talked about this before for he was cut off out of the land of the living now here's isaiah isaiah knows this man's got to be human flesh because isaiah is the one in isaiah 7 said behold a virgin shall conceive so they knew those old testament prophets knew that god was going to come in human flesh it's just that the denominations of the day or the hierarchy of the day didn't believe it so what'd they do they didn't just they killed the prophet they shut the prophets up didn't what jesus said jesus said you wanted walls you go out there and you and what were they doing they were washing the tomb of isaiah boy we just we got this thing it looks should we shine this baby up jesus said you the way to put them in there you put them in there you're the one who put your body in that grave and you're and you're wiping it off because of your tradition he was cut off with the land of living in other words he didn't have any natural progeny he didn't need a national natural progeny his progeny was spiritual his genealogy and generation was spiritual it was not natural it was that genesis 1 26 man that was made in his image and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth sounds like a pretty good statue of perfect man god yet it pleased the lord to bruise him look he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin his soul he shall what see his seed see his progeny when he will give his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasures of the lord shall prosper in his lamb he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities look therefore will i divide him a portion with the great jesus got an inheritance amen jesus got an inheritance and he shall divide the spoil with a strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death not in death unto death he acted the part of death the soul just came out of the body and where did it go it went to hell and preached to the souls in prison and the long suffering of the days of noah right and you were in him when that happened so you've already been to hell you don't ever have to go again amen that thrills my heart because you know what if i identify myself with that man and he went there i don't have to go i don't have to stand judgment he took my transgression he made intercession for my transgression like we were talking about last night the holy ghost is an advocate you can't be be an advocate for yourself that's not allowed in a court i mean some people try to do that but they can't they bitterly fail when you try to be your own lawyer yeah anyway so you have an advocate though that stands up and said hey i'll take his sin i'll take whatever it is that he has or she has whatever it is i'll take it an advocate that stands in your place and says i'll take what this person has he made intercession for the transgressors and that's me and you you love the lord now we know that the baby got here we're not we're gonna skip through all that the baby got here he came exactly the way they said let's go to um if you would go to quote number two god's gift always find their places and i'm gonna back up those two scriptures remember he fulfilled all the scriptures he came as a baby he came swaddling clothes he came in a manger he came in bethlehem micah prophesied that he would come in bethlehem so he came exactly the way the bible said he was going to come and even when herod heard about this he inquires and says where's this king supposed to be born so they knew the scrolls he wasn't a heathen he knew the scripture and they told him they said oh he's to be born in bethlehem bethlehem well if those two wise men saw that and they took them two years to get here because remember the wise men didn't see a baby the wise man saw a child because the bible says the young child was sitting in the mother's lap sitting so he was older why did herod say okay everybody from two years old and down i'm gonna kill them all so because he was gonna try to get jesus and kill him in between those two years right so now watch here what happens with the magi and watch these people these magi they brought him watch the gifts they brought him identified what they thought he was they brought him gold frankincense and myrrh now watch what these symbols that i want to talk to you about now is what these symbols mean now i've got some scripture wrote out here that we'll read just in a moment lord willing now gold frankincense and myrrh now gold in the bible how feeling it fits to christ because gold speaks of deity gold is deity what did they do even if they made something out of brass even if they made something out of wood in the old testament they overlaid it with gold to make it deity or deified and if anybody's going to make a a a god a little idol what's usually made out of it's either got some gold in it or on it why because they signify that with deity well you didn't have to put anything on jesus he was deity amen he was gold gold is deity we'll get to that in just a moment frankincense speaks of service and myrrh is death god deity and service to die and that's what he was the very thing that they brought identified what they thought he was now let's go number three now how fitting these things it's a different different quote fitted exactly the commission from god in his journey on earth now watch this now the first thing god this was god jesus was god in the form of a man that's hard for people to swallow that even today that he was god that's what he was he wasn't nothing less than god he was god manifested in flesh he was the creator in his own creation now he was the creator in his creation by the creation for the creation he liked that so much he said it again he was a creator of his creation by his creation for his creation all whines right back in god the whole thing don't you see fullness of god he was a creator in so much that he was god and he was a being on earth a being of time which meant that he must have had a beginning the body therefore he created himself a body to live in god himself created a body for himself that by his creation he might save the lost creation that he created everything's got to do with creation and there was jehovah lying there crying like a baby can you imagine it the next quote number four god's wrapped gift number five he was god and became man not rich man poor man that's the super sign that's number five watch this let's read the red down here when that first little toothless mouth opened in that manger on that first crib first christmas morning in his little manger crib the first little yell that went from his voice that was god crying how many of you can believe that how many can you believe that that's what god did the first little toothless mouth opened in the manger the first little christmas morning in his little manger crib the first little yell that went forth that was god crying jehovah crying a man come from god and was man ever went man came to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he talled like a man but yet he was emmanuel this is the super sign god dwelling in the creation that he created the super sign it shall be a sign unto you he was so poor when he came to the earth he came through a barred womb a barred womb of a woman and had to borrow a grave to be buried in remember joseph for armathea they just dug the grave and nobody had been in it before and that's where they put jesus now a virgin shall conceive without sexual interception jehovah barred the womb of mary a woman to perform the duty that he'd give an everlasting sign and was so poor on earth after 33 years and a half of ministry he had to borrow a grave to be buried in can you imagine talk about immaculate conception what meanest thou anyhow all right let's finish right here revelations 3 14 this is what i want to get to now are we not in the layout to see in church age i know we're called out of the age because we're bribed but we're living in the time of the laodicea boy if you don't believe that oh lordy you're deceived you're way past this eve if there is a thing because every characteristic of this layout out of sin age we see it manifest today in the world and in people and everything but now watch what he says though and unto the angel of the church of the layout of sins right now what's the angel the church allowed to say we've heard his voice okay these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now that's strange because how can god be created and this says he's the beginning whatever this person is is the beginning of the creation of god all right let's let the prophet tell us in the layout to see in church age so let's go to the quote the 14th verse to the angel of the lord of laodicea right these things which saith amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god oh my we got all we had all night on that right there how the lord would reveal that to us watch the amen is the last he's appeared all the way down through in different things but here's the last church age where it says this is the finish i am the last. now to show that he was the first also as he was he's the beginning of the creation of god oh do you catch it how could god be created if he's a spirit son of god can't be created it is the creator that's the one we were talking about the logos to when we went way back before time brother brown said that was the son of god that was the creator that was that was god stepping over in another form so that we can understand who he is all right how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning but he that as the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest a little toothless baby laying in the manger when god lived in him he is god's creation oh my see the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body what i read in hebrews 10 5 a body thou has prepared me thou who the prophets god threw the prophets he created himself a body to live him when god created himself a body he came down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god see oh isn't he wonderful and now we read john 1 14 says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us jesus christ was the way we were supposed to come had there not been a fall because as the fall happened to restore what was fallen it had to come the same way except for no sex because isaiah said it wouldn't be by sex it wouldn't be by instrumentation of man it would be by god creating that's what he was going to do to begin with how many times you hear that word create create create create god's a creator but he let us fall knowing we would fall he let us fall in human flesh so that he can make himself human flesh because that's what he always wanted was to be a god that we can handle shake hands with touch hug his neck even the disciples after jesus left they said we've touched the word of god because they literally did but they didn't understand who he was they all if they didn't knew who he was they wouldn't run from him that night he got crucified they didn't exactly know who the son of man was they knew he was different but see you and i in the end time and we'll start this afternoon with this man as he walks through his journey he is the son of man and there's no one like him on the earth the prophet of god william branham was close enough as anybody could get but he was not the son of man because what did i say the other day the characteristics of the son of man the son of man is he's got to be virgin born so that just discludes everybody since abel and cain until today only one person was born virgin born and that was the son of man the head of the church we'll read a little bit later on that's why he was made the head of the church he's the head of the church he got a body a body now has prepared me and now he's preparing a body a bride through what through the word of god by spoken word is the original seed not by anything that man's going to do man doesn't run this church the holy ghost runs this church the son of god the baptism of the holy ghost but what is he doing though he's changing me and you as we go up that statue of perfect man because look here's the head ship right here what is that that's we'll see it this afternoon if we get to it that was rejected the headstone was rejected who is the headstone not the son of god the son of god wasn't rejected through the church ages that's what got him in the church age but the son of man was rejected they lost that stone that revelation but he said now that headstone has now become what the chief cornerstone a little bitty headstone right here this whole foundation was on proving that when he got into this age right now today we'd know what we're talking about because they didn't down there because i'll read you in the bible where the bible says zerubbabel is gonna clean this thing off not make a new one you can't make a new foundation because the foundation of the whole thing is built on the apostles and prophets jesus christ being the chief what cornerstone so you can't do away with it but what they done was is they rejected him all to the church ages they rejected him but today is the day that we don't reject him no more today is the day of our salvation not just for our soul but for our spirit and our body that we can live so close to god that we'll raise the dead and get out of here let's stand to our feet musicians come i know sometimes it's tough to follow but that's what our requirement is folks in this end time is to be the son of man the lord jesus christ in bride form on this earth doing the same thing he did and you can't do it with false word you got to do it listen there wasn't one moment one moment in the son of man's life that he was wrong now he might have made human mistakes he probably dropped a fork somewhere he stumbled over a a a rock on the ground he got scuffed up he was a man but when he stood up and said i and my father are one he meant what he said when he said all these things all these things he said because you know then you go well i ain't perfect you ain't perfect i've heard that joke all my life and it's junk the bible says be therefore perfect and we'll read it this afternoon jesus even had to be made perfect because it says being made perfect became the author of our salvation now that wasn't talking about his soul i wasn't talking about his soul that was talking about his humanity that he yielded to the father and made that thing live so where's that man now brother darny is he gone somewhere off and we just we there's no access to him see that's what the world has said that's why they put the son of man out they said we can't live that i ain't god and you ain't god well that's not what the bible says jesus said father i pray that they be one as you and i are one now how was the father and jesus one they were one so he's praying that we'd be the same we just got to believe that there stands that man that can do it our advocate our high priest our healer our redeemer our savior don't ever forget what god did for you let's sing a song god bless you thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done what have we done to deserve this such glory be happy that you know this be happy the word's been made available to you now what are you going to do about it you're going to throw it away and walk out into the world what are they going to give you that's just more trouble more heartache [Music] but come into this and he'll give you peace he'll give you joy he promised it you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done to

year whatever you got inside of you let it out if you got the new birth you got the creator inside of you let him out let him do his work he's bound by our tradition i said ours our tradition our individual tradition ever what you want to make that be our unbelief that's what god's bound he's bound by that and we're trying by the word of god to get you just to see who you are i want you to see who you are i tell you who you are people been telling who they are for centuries where the bride where the bride where the bride where the bride we're the bride brother brown said there's been brides brides churches brides churches he said but there's going to come one and i just believe i'm part of that one the one that's going to see the manifestation of the son of man where when we speak [Music] things will happen listen have not you been bound and oppressed long enough haven't we went around and around horeb long enough 40 years and the promised land's only three days journey 40 years they wore their self out all because they sinned and didn't believe what the prophet of the day said that sound familiar prophet moses they didn't believe what he said so god said look you're not going in you're gonna go round and round until the unbelievers get kicked out but i'm going to raise up a group [Music] i'm going to raise up a group that's going to believe what i said let's bow our heads do heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us forgive us of our sins lord if we've said anything lord against you father we're just trying to get to people to see who they are lord not who they're going to be but who you've already said they were lord and you saw a group of people make it lord and you sent a prophet you sent the holy ghost you sent us everything we need lord now what are we going to do with it father i pray that we'll take that sword of faith and it will lord leave this building lord better people that you'll be with us lord and take care of us until we come back and furthermore the service bless our pastor lord and keep him strong keep him healthy lord be with each one in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you're dismissed god bless you i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man [Music]
