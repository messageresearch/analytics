========================================

thank you my parents are with us this morning and my mom just retired so she's feeling good all right we're going to look at Matthew chapter 7. and verse 16 today not dead fishes Matthew chapter 7 verse 16. a lot of times we read Rome speak up we can't hear you good okay here's a scripture that a lot of times maybe we look at a little wrong so uh what this is what I want to look at this morning um Matthew chapter 7 verse 16. let's start at verse 15. beware of false prophets which come to you but inwardly they are having rules can y'all hear me I can turn the fan off no no no no no no just speak up yeah inwardly they are ravening rules you shall know them by their fruits the men get a greatness of thorns or feets or thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree brings forth evil Freedom a good tree cannot bring forth evil for you neither can a corrupt three bring forth good Freedom every tree that bringeth not forth good for you is handed down and cast Into the Fire wherefore buy their fruits fruits of the spirit and and a lot of times we read through the nine fruits and we see that you know you're supposed to have them express love and joy and those things and and uh you know brother Brown said that the Christian Science expresses more love than we can and so you look at them and think uh a more love a lot of times it seems like we do and uh so what exactly is love and why is it so important you know brother Brown talked about um the evidence with the evidence of the Holy Ghost really is is that you believe the word for your day the word that was brought in the season that it was supposed to be brought in but here Jesus says it by by their fruit you shall know them and this little picture here is a fig tree and these are fish and uh you know uh if you look at a fig tree one time Jesus in Mark chapter 11 Jesus was walking by a peak tree over there in Israel where they they just grow so huge when he looked at the tree and he said well there's no fruit on this tree and so he cursed the tree because here in in Matthew uh he said a tree that doesn't bear forth fruit is going to be hewned down and cast Into the Fire so uh he wasn't just a person at haphazardly but he was trying to teach his Apostle something and you know uh right after he spoke that right after he cursed it he he proceeded to tell his his disciples uh he he began to open up what fruits were and if you kind of I won't read the I believe we're familiar enough with the with the little story that he began to talk about you know when if you really have faith then you can say to a mountain be cast into the seeds and it will it will obey you because you're bearing for through the lure for your age is is being pushed up within you and quickened by the spirit of God that so that you act just like Jesus active so that you obey you obey the word you uh you move in the same line that Jesus moved in now there's what's really interesting about the Fig Tree is that you never see you know with a lot of other plants uh there's a little honeybee or a different wasp and things come along that you can see but with the Fig Tree it's a mystery how it gets fertilized how uh the the pollen from One Tree comes into the pollen of another tree and fertilizes it and you know to me it's a mystery in the gospel how that happens how all these things are are just Mysteries you know Paul talked about in the Old Testament they look through a glass Darkly it was like they uh or even today you know it's not it's not maybe not clear what's what's going on but what happens is um there's a little wasp called a fig a fig wasp that coke slides into a small small hole and as it does it tears off its wings it loses everything it loses its wings and its antenna because it's trying to get through this little small hole and once it gets in there it pollinates that uh that uh that fig and it stays inside of that feed and it gives its life it dies inside of the Fig so that that fig can drop and be more be uh produce another another fig tree and you know you can say if you look at this in the spiritual you say well if if you look at yourself like that fig you say well you know I always was eternal I always had this this predestinating seed so I don't need that wasp but that wasp had to come and fertilize this food and it's a it's a a mystery because you can look at that and not see and you know I was thinking about how the you know brother Brown before he preached the seals he's increased that sermon Christ hidden in Simplicity and revealing and saying how the gospel is supposed to be so simple and I I've just been reading a lot of quotes it's been real good for me about all the things that little brown had to say about how simple the gospel is because the gospel is received by a real simple people and it's supposed to be real simple so that just so simple that just a little small little wasp so simple that the world overlooks how how just Sublime it is that a little wasps will fertilize this so let's uh since we kind of talked about that listen let's turn over to Genesis chapter one and take a look at how what we're talking about and then we'll read some quotes let's look at verse one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form of void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water now now this is a big stumbling block for me because you know schools are teaching evolution and you say well how could the world be really millions of years old or whatever now brother Randall said when you read this there's a period at the end of that first verse in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and now he created it and at some point now the world was in darkness and it's voided just like when you were in sin you were in darkness that's right within a long came life and at some point maybe you know brother Graham talked about uh there was laying in the earth seeds already Seas laying in the earth and when the light struck them let's turn over to verse 11. and God said let the Earth bring forth grass there's yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after it's kind and seated in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth your ass and Herb yielding the seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good now there's the whole story of the whole Plan of Redemption everything right there is that they will see the Earth and God when the light is showing up when it began to produce and over time you know that seed take take a take a look at this one little seed in it it's sprouted up and it began to grow and grow from to the stall to the shook until that Original Seed that laid in the ground produced the same thing again the the uh you know brother Brown talked about the corner the corner wheat and and that's what down through the seven Church ages God the whole earth has been waiting and rolling for the original sea to be made manifested again and the original sea is what what uh what we're looking for is for this fruit to be born out the the fruit is the Original Seed made manifest again so think about the nine spiritual fruits these nine fruits are the attributes of God made manifest and somebody that's walking on the earth love joy and peace and we look at these love joy and peace and and long-suffering and Temperance and faith and all of these fruits and think and and you know without the revelation of the Holy Ghost we have a conception in our own mind that's different than what it really is what love really is so let's look at Psalm chapter one David called a vision I believe and you know a long time you think well you know I don't have visions of things but I know a prophet that came and saw Ephesians and he gave me the vision that we could fulfill it you know without a profit you know we we would be proven in darkness without knowing what to do but a prophet came in the season that God ordained it to come so that we can manifest the word for our age now so Psalm 1 verse 1 blessed is the man that walked at the knot in the Council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sit up in the seat of the storm I'm just read it the whole uh down to verse three and then we'll go back through it but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate day and night I think she'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper blessed is the man now think about how blessed you are if you are born of the spirit of God because you're not part of the denominational system anymore you're grafted in to uh the grafted into the vine you know a people that didn't even deserve it would put this gentile people that were part of were put into were grafted into the original life this Divine that we can become partakers of God a great Plan of Redemption so we're not we're so blessed and that walketh in the counsel of the ungodly now you know the scriptures make a big difference between ungodly and Sinners and a sinner is uh you know vote around talk about how God loves Sinners he hates sin but he loves Sinners because he's he's drawing that they have I hope but now ungodly they say I'm you know they sit in a church and say I understand the law I understand what the Bible teaches but it's not made manifesting them okay just like the Pharisee said we know what the law teaches we know you know they say I that you're not supposed to be healing people are on the Sabbath day you're not supposed to be uh uh teaching on the Sabbath and these things but the law was made alive right in front of them the fruits of the word were being born right May manifest right in front of them and they still receive it because they have they had the word the letter of the word and it wasn't Made Alive it was a very very forth fruit now that's ungodly as they say I I am a Christian but they're not bearing force of fruits the word is not the word for their day is not being made manifesting in you know and knows that he uh probably a lot of people said we're we're we can go to church or whatever the uh the plan of the day what you know that we go to a denomination or we uh we we're Christians or whatever you know they might have said then but Noah was the one in the ark because he he wrote a message for the day they didn't catch his vision then they uh their tree was healing down and swallowed up in the fluid and uh and then the next verse let's see the next little piece but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and his law that he meditate day and night now I believe this is how you bear forth proofs by listening to the books and the tales by keeping your mind constantly on God you see if you say well I'm going to let uh just to be frank don't let go to hell do my studying for me I'm going to let uh I'm just gonna uh worry about reading the Bible worry about reading the the message in the Sunday school class but you must constantly be meditating on the word and program taught us how to how to meditate he said when you when you stop and think about the Lord don't blink your mind out because that's when the Devil comes in but think about how things fit together and think about how you know run it through if you can't run it through all the scripture from Genesis to Revelation that something's all for your Revelation and meditate on it constantly you know Joshua said the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night the thou mayest observed to do according to all that is written therein within Thou shalt make thy ways prosperous and then thy shalt have good success that man subserved to do to do according to all that is written therein now we put a lot of weight on understanding and knowledge but you know all down through the scriptures they they didn't just it wasn't just their faith but they had the works to go with it what if Abel would have said I I have a revelation of faith that I should take a lamb and he didn't do it he had to take the lane of him it had to be offered I remember reading a story from Charles Spurgeon where he said he said uh there was a man in this congregation that said he had been working with him and trying to get him to see that he needed to be baptized and finally the man saw it I see what the scripture is saying about being baptized but he still wouldn't go and be baptized and what what kind of state does that put that man in where he sees it but he won't go and do it just like uh at Candice Barnett they saw or they should have seen I'll say it like that they should have seen that they should go on then but they didn't okay let's see where a man and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water by the rivers of water now the rivers are what we're talking about these nine spiritual gifts now how did you come to the water you can't go Water by seeing these nine uh these nine fruits manifested in somebody whether it was bug random on the tape or whether it was somebody that came and sat down with you and explained to you the scripture through these rivers that came out of this one water it was one water not by one phase by one baptism by one Lord we're saved by one water and these nine Rivers come out and reach out to grab us through through people for one water and uh you know brother Branham explained it he talked about how it was the nine spiritual the nine fruits and he also said it was the Old and New Testament that sins major contribution on what it is is the word the fruits and I think about the fruits all of the Bible being made manifest the nine spiritual fruits all the old and the New Testament coming to life and that's what the the the Sadducees and the Pharisees failed understand is it's not just a uh but it's not just being able to read and being able to quote what program said I mean that well you know they they look they were able to quote what Moses said they had it they had it so ingrained in their mind what Moses said that you know is is told that they could take a scroll and roll it up and put a pencil or a poke hole through it and know which letter that what they poked it through with every letter that they touched but they knew the word so much but the word wasn't alive again these fruits weren't made manifest the fruit is the life that bringeth forth his fruit in his season that bringeth forth his fruit now you are a tree you're a part but to bring forth these fruits you've got to be part of that tree that gave his life on doubt so he's bringing forth his fruit in his season is God's fruit in the prophet season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prospered you know the the brother Brown priest a sermon called the dry tree and you were just looking at how uh to fertilize one of these things you need two trees you need a bright green tree and you need a bright tree and Jesus came to Earth to bridge the gap so to speak between so that you know there was no way for us to get back to the variety that's right because Adam and Eve had turned it down in the Garden of Eden so he had to come and bring that gap for us and give his life just that little like that little fig wasp he gave his life so that that fig would be fertilized and once he gave his life that bridery was planted on the day of Pentecost and it began to grow and grow and grow until that's why it says his Leaf also shall not live the plan and the purpose of that dry tree is not going to is going to be accomplished because uh is predestining to be fulfilled just like in Genesis 1 11 the seeds that were in the earth were predestinated to come forth to make manifested to make manifest The Original Seed and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper his Leaf shall not wither that's a promise for us too when you were born again you will never die you're uh filled with the Holy Ghost and you have a promise but whatsoever he doeth shall prosper why he got predestinated fruit in there you can't destroy it because it's predestinated they're Philippians 1 11 says that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness and we know righteousness coming from the Hebrew word which means one new numeric surpasses their iniquity how can my marriage surpass my iniquity the only way my mirror can surpass my iniquity is if I'm part of that tree that in his life on Calvin that he died in his Merit uh surpasses my iniquity now fruits all down through scripture the fruits were the the bore record of what was true um let's uh well I won't turn there I'll just tell the story in Numbers chapter 17 we were looking at the number 17 a while ago here's a number 17. uh they were the Israelites wanted to know if Aaron really was the one you know that the one that they should the the priest if he was the one that God had chosen now here's how God knows prove to the world that God has chosen to divide me but believing the word for your day and then making it come manifest in your life so they wanted to know what Aaron are you the right one that all this contention in the in the midst of the people and so Moses say put your name and and your in the staff you know they put the staff in the 12 Trials of Israel and Aaron put his name in the staff of Levi and then laid it before the in before the the presence of the Chicago just like the seeds in Genesis 1 that when the light came the S the light from the s-u-n Came Upon those seeds and they Rose and made manifest in order yeah so they deleted it before the life of the son behind that Shekinah Glory and that staff that was dead it was it was chopped off it brought forth and only it didn't just bring forth leaves and everything but it went through the whole process until it was fruit and they bore fruit and that's how they knew that God was with Eric in Galatians 5 22 23 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness temperance against such there is no law now how can you have a law against God's word being made manifest there is no law That's the Law being fulfilled that's law of Grace right there but brother Dale's been preaching on Law and Grace now you can read the Old Testament law but when it becomes a grace to you that's the law being made manifest so what is What is love now program said any questions and answers 1964 he said now he's talking about different things that we look at as the evidence of the Holy Ghost that's no evidence of holy ghosts you can't rely up on that you can't rely upon the fruit of the spirit because the first fruit of this period of love and the Christian Science exercise more love than anybody I know of and they even deny Jesus Christ being Divine you know I think a lot of times we have our own mental conception of what love is and today love is acceptance of anything anything goes just whatever wrap your arms around it and draw it close to you because as long as this you know as long as it's out there then you know people say you're not lovely if you don't Embrace just whatever Embrace false Doctrine Embrace uh wrong living Embrace everything that's not right but um Real Love is in John chapter 5 and I just got about is that I don't know if that clocks fast anymore so let's look at John chapter five to see what real love is John chapter 5 verse one after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there's that Jerusalem by the sheet Market a pool which is called in a Hebrew tune but this is having fried porches in these led great multitude of impotent folks with blind hot withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and Troubled Water whatsoever then first after the trip whosoever they first draft of the turbine of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and eight years when Jesus saw and lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto them wilt thou be made whole now our conception of Love is that he would just go through and just because he had the power within him to just heal everybody why did he go and brother Brandon said this man he he escapes me I can't remember exactly what he said was wrong with him but he could get up and walk he he uh he he uh you know they were I'm sure there were much worse cases than this man so why did he go to this man it was because we have our conception of love is not what God's conception is and brother Reynolds said that love and compassion is to do the will of God that's what love is it's to do his will so uh you know brother random told the story about how people were coming in to say why don't we pray for my aunt so that they would be healed why why won't God just heal my aunt or somebody that they have relatives and people that didn't even believe the message didn't even believe weren't even Christians but they wanted them to be healed but God doesn't work that like that he goes according to uh he's got to manifest his word it just it amazes me the goodness of God how people would come into the prayer line and say you know just horrible sins in their life and brother I will say do you repent and you think well maybe they've got to get go through a little grace period where a little trial period where to prove them and things but no right then they would receive their healing they didn't have to didn't take a long time you repent and you're healed but that's that's what uh God doesn't just go out and heal willy-nilly but he goes he knew that this man would receive it he knew it and that's how you predestinated by four knowledge because he knew that this man when he would come to him and say well thou be made whole the infinite man would answer him said and say uh that he would he when he told him rise took up thy man and walk he knew he wouldn't argue with it that he would just rise and take up his bed and go believe him and that's what real love is and uh just finishing up first John 2 15 says love not the world that we're talking about manifesting the word I'm gonna just leave it real quick hello not the world neither of the things that are in the world if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in it now manifesting the word if you love the things of the world the love of the father is not even in you you see John 14 15 if you love me keep my Commandments there's another if you're if you have faith then manifested mine works John 14 23 Jesus answered and said in the name of a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our boat with him in John 15 9 as a father have loved me so have I loved you continue in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love of loving God is is doing just like Jesus did which is obedience to God's Will and we'll stop right there
