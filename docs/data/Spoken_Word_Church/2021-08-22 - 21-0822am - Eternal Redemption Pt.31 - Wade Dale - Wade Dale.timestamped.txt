[5:35] for the young people
[5:37] and we will
[5:39] get more with you as we go on as to who
[5:41] needs to help
[5:43] um in that so
[5:45] all minds clear if you've got your
[5:46] bibles let's turn to the book of hebrews
[5:49] i know marshall and john's not used to
[5:51] these long services so if
[5:53] it'll be okay
[5:57] listen if jesus christ can hang on a
[5:58] cross for three hours
[6:01] with nails in his hand
[6:03] beat like hamburger meat
[6:05] we can set for a two-hour service
[6:07] he saved my soul doing that hey man
[6:09] maybe this will save yours
[6:11] hebrews 9 verse 11.
[6:13] let's pray before we get started
[6:14] heavenly father we pray today lord
[6:17] number one that you'll bless this girl
[6:18] named angie
[6:21] lord in this school father we know that
[6:23] the devil's a cruel person and he uses
[6:25] people
[6:26] lord i pray that that devil will can
[6:28] will stop doing what he's doing to this
[6:30] little girl
[6:31] and that you'll cover him lord as
[6:33] brother bob said lord the angels
[6:35] are encamped about those that believe
[6:37] you father so i know this little girl
[6:39] needs you lord and we pray that you'll
[6:41] put those angels around her lord and
[6:43] that bullying part will stop
[6:45] lord we know you're a god that comes on
[6:47] the scene lord if we ask because we're
[6:49] your children
[6:50] we're not as the angels where you
[6:52] created them for worship but lord you
[6:54] created us to be your children
[6:56] sons and daughters of god
[6:58] to live on the earth and i what as
[7:00] brother ernie always said we're we're a
[7:02] supernatural being come down here to
[7:04] have a human experience
[7:06] and lord this experience
[7:09] lord is what's going to carry us through
[7:10] father we pray now that you'd be with
[7:12] each one that's under the sound of my
[7:14] voice
[7:15] heal the sick lord be with the ones that
[7:17] are sick be with the
[7:18] brother jim babb's family there lord and
[7:20] happy valley that passed on lord we pray
[7:23] that you comfort them comfort that
[7:24] church lord as they're going through a
[7:26] battle we pray that you comfort each of
[7:28] your bride around the world lord that
[7:29] you'll be with each one may we continue
[7:31] this service lord under the leadership
[7:33] of the holy spirit in jesus name we pray
[7:35] amen now we've been on this this is part
[7:38] 31 so i'm going to have to background
[7:40] just a little bit
[7:42] for the new ones that are here so uh
[7:45] let's read hebrews 9 verse 11. now the
[7:47] whole theme of the
[7:49] of the service is going to be eternal
[7:51] redemption
[7:53] all right because we needed redeeming we
[7:55] were lost
[7:57] undone come to the world speaking lies
[8:01] part of the devil's economy
[8:04] amen
[8:07] right
[8:09] and then we had to be
[8:10] redeemed we had to be called back or we
[8:13] had to be taken out of the pawn shop we
[8:15] had to be pulled up out of the mire in
[8:17] the muck and who did it jesus christ but
[8:20] christ being coming high priests of good
[8:21] things to come by greater and more
[8:23] perfect tabernacle you like that
[8:24] marshall you can see that it's got big
[8:26] letters
[8:27] not made with hands that is to say not
[8:29] of this building
[8:30] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[8:32] but by his own blood he entered him once
[8:34] into the holy place having obtained
[8:37] eternal redemption for us now remember
[8:39] he was the eternal one but his body was
[8:42] not eternal
[8:44] his body had to die as a sacrifice
[8:46] according to the old testament
[8:49] in isaiah 53 that he gave his soul a
[8:52] ransom but he gave his body as a
[8:53] sacrifice he was the lamb of god to take
[8:55] away the sin of the world all right
[8:57] let's go to revelations 11
[8:59] verse 3 because we're going to talk
[9:01] about the two witnesses
[9:02] i will give power unto my two witnesses
[9:04] and they shall prophesy one thousand two
[9:06] hundred 203 score days which is 1260
[9:09] days clothed in sackcloth now let's go
[9:11] to isaiah 65 i hope we'll get to this
[9:13] this afternoon
[9:15] isaiah 65 verse 17 says be behold
[9:19] i create a new heavens and a new earth
[9:21] how many of your new creatures in christ
[9:24] amen old things are passed away behold
[9:27] all things have become new for behold i
[9:29] created new heavens and a new earth
[9:30] listen we're not going to live on this
[9:32] sin soaked earth all of our life
[9:34] this thing's going to be renovated it's
[9:36] going to be changed
[9:38] and the former shall not be remembered
[9:40] nor come
[9:41] into mind you may be seated in the lord
[9:43] add his blessing
[9:44] to the reading of word now as we
[9:45] continue this
[9:48] let's go to matthew 16
[9:51] and we'll start right here
[9:53] because jesus told us he said
[9:57] he went they wanted to know lord who are
[9:59] you and he said well i
[10:01] uh you know they said well you were
[10:02] jeremiah and you were one of the
[10:03] prophets and some of the people calling
[10:05] him belzebub and some called him this
[10:07] and some called him that jesus said well
[10:09] who do you say that i am in other words
[10:11] his followers the very people that was
[10:12] with him he asked him said whom say ye
[10:15] that i am and simon peter that peter i
[10:18] like peter he pops up and speaks a lot
[10:20] right
[10:21] thou art to christ the son of the living
[10:23] god and jesus answered and said unto him
[10:25] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[10:27] and blood hath not revealed this unto
[10:29] thee but my father which is in heaven
[10:31] and i say also unto thee thou art peter
[10:34] and upon this rock listen
[10:36] a lot of people think that the church is
[10:37] built on peter the catholic church says
[10:39] peter's the first pope yet they won't
[10:40] let popes have wives
[10:43] and peter had a wife because jesus
[10:45] healed his mother-in-law
[10:46] pretty sensible
[10:47] so it wasn't peter
[10:50] and then upon a rock it's not a rock
[10:53] god's not built upon a rock
[10:55] but what is it it's a revelation
[10:57] rock means revelation upon this
[11:00] revelation i will build my church
[11:03] not the church nominal but the church
[11:05] the the people that are the
[11:07] living
[11:08] sons and daughters of god in the gates
[11:10] of hell is going to be here
[11:13] but it won't prevail against us
[11:15] that's what we're looking at now the
[11:16] gates of hell is going to be here
[11:19] then the bible says there's no weapon
[11:20] formed so there's going to be a weapon
[11:22] that is formed
[11:24] that can stand against this word of god
[11:25] that's why we believe to get back to the
[11:27] word of god
[11:28] stay in the word of god and the word of
[11:30] god will tell us what we're doing and
[11:32] like bob was talking today we're not
[11:34] scared of prophets because amos 2 3 and
[11:36] 7 says the lord wants to do nothing
[11:39] unless he reveals it to his servants the
[11:40] prophets all right so men have problems
[11:43] with prophets i don't have a problem
[11:44] with them but if we didn't have prophets
[11:45] you wouldn't have a bible
[11:49] the only problem is the prophet we
[11:50] believe came in the end time was so
[11:52] contrary to all the others but wasn't
[11:53] jesus very contrary to all the
[11:56] kind of
[11:58] anyway
[11:59] they called him belgium and he was god
[12:02] so now let's look around here and see he
[12:04] said i'll build my church that's okay no
[12:07] go ahead he said i'll build my church
[12:09] jesus didn't say i'll let you build your
[12:10] church he said i'll build my church on
[12:13] this revelation
[12:14] of the son of god
[12:16] which the son of god is what
[12:20] god
[12:21] in spirit form
[12:23] that came on the day of pentecost
[12:26] right the baptism of the holy ghost
[12:28] jesus said i'll send you a comforter
[12:31] in my name
[12:33] so it wasn't another person it was the
[12:34] same guy
[12:36] just immorphied into another form called
[12:38] the baptism of the holy ghost fell on
[12:40] 120 in the upper rim according to the
[12:42] book of acts right
[12:45] and so i'll be with you even in you
[12:47] to the end of the world not just with
[12:49] you i'll be in you to the end of the
[12:50] world but then we look at the
[12:53] he says now he kept calling himself son
[12:56] of man son of man and i was talking to
[12:58] brother rush yesterday and
[13:00] i want you to get this real good and it
[13:02] may be foreign for some but that's okay
[13:04] but remember the wise virgins
[13:07] that we used as an analogy a couple of
[13:09] sundays ago the wise virgins is what
[13:13] they got oil they got the holy ghost
[13:18] right remember there was ten of them
[13:20] five were wise and five were foolish
[13:22] the five wise virgins went to heaven the
[13:24] five foolish virgins stayed on earth
[13:27] because when the bridegroom called the
[13:28] five woke up and they had oil
[13:31] the oil is what signifies the holy ghost
[13:34] all right
[13:35] don't get scared it is a ghost
[13:39] but it's holy
[13:40] some people have ghosts and they're not
[13:42] so holy
[13:43] so
[13:44] but if you got the holy ghost that's god
[13:46] himself
[13:47] so they got the holy ghost though so
[13:48] that made them children of god the wise
[13:50] virgins had oil in their lamp they got
[13:53] ready to go but now remember the foolish
[13:55] virgins
[13:57] didn't go
[13:58] because they didn't have oil in their
[14:00] lamp
[14:01] right oil signified the holy ghost so
[14:03] they didn't get the holy ghost sure they
[14:04] might have been good church members
[14:06] because they were virgins
[14:08] amen they were virgins but they did not
[14:11] continue on with god and take further
[14:14] revelation
[14:16] of what god had for your day
[14:19] not luther's day not wesley's day not
[14:21] pentecostal's day not even yesterday
[14:24] but today
[14:26] amen
[14:27] it's a today god
[14:29] he's the same yesterday today
[14:32] and forever
[14:33] so the son of god down to the church
[14:35] ages that's what jesus said i'll build
[14:37] my church on that
[14:39] and then a
[14:40] foolish virgin is going to come up and
[14:42] they're going to what they're going to
[14:44] be given eternal life
[14:46] but they didn't get it here something
[14:48] caused them not to get the holy ghost in
[14:50] other words they may sit in a church
[14:52] where it says well you just need to
[14:53] shake hands or you just need to shake
[14:55] somebody or you just need to speak in
[14:56] tongues
[14:57] we don't believe if that's all there is
[14:59] to it
[15:00] it's the life behind it
[15:03] amen live me a sermon
[15:06] don't worry about preaching it live it
[15:08] so we were discussing yesterday but
[15:10] remember there's a part that we're going
[15:12] to skip to where we see that paul says
[15:15] we which are alive and remain
[15:18] now see that's a different group
[15:21] alive
[15:22] means you don't have to be resurrected
[15:26] now i'm telling you what the bible says
[15:27] i believe there's a group of people
[15:28] that's going to stand on this earth and
[15:29] death will not have a hold on them amen
[15:33] and we can believe it's you if you want
[15:34] to i'm just dumb enough to believe it's
[15:36] me
[15:37] all right i'm just dumb enough to
[15:39] believe it well me okay thank you
[15:42] but paul says i'll show you a mystery
[15:45] we shall not all sleep
[15:51] that's a mystery
[15:53] a mystery had to be brought to us by a
[15:54] prophet
[15:56] we didn't get this by our own
[15:58] intelligence
[16:00] i show you a mystery we shall not all
[16:03] sleep what we're gonna somebody's gonna
[16:05] stand and be alive
[16:08] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[16:11] in the twinkling of an eye to last trump
[16:13] for the trumpet shall sound it's not
[16:16] it's not
[16:18] it's not
[16:19] brother paul picking up a trumpet and
[16:21] somebody's going to walk out in the
[16:22] middle of the
[16:23] graveyard
[16:25] that's too obvious
[16:28] i thought this was going to be a secret
[16:31] i thought this was going to be a secret
[16:32] catching away i thought he was going to
[16:34] come as a thief in the night
[16:37] to come and get us and the graves are
[16:39] not going to be opened as they say open
[16:41] and you're not going to go out there and
[16:42] see a mound of dirt thrown off
[16:44] i know that's silly but people believe
[16:46] that
[16:48] you know the only reason jesus rolled
[16:51] the the stone off was to show me and you
[16:54] that he came out
[16:55] i mean in a glorified body i believe he
[16:57] stepped through a wall about several
[16:59] hours after he was resurrected he just
[17:01] walked right through a wall so he didn't
[17:03] have to pull that stone away but
[17:05] remember the seal of death was broke so
[17:07] he had to signify to the world that that
[17:09] seal was open and he stepped out and
[17:12] said all power in heaven earth has been
[17:13] given unto me all right everybody with
[17:15] me
[17:17] and the dead shall be raised
[17:18] incorruptible
[17:20] and we shall be changed changed from
[17:22] what changed from these vile bodies that
[17:24] we are and to young people as abraham
[17:27] and sarah were changed back to have
[17:29] children that's another great mystery
[17:31] that we see in the bible
[17:33] for this corruptable must put on
[17:34] incorruption and this mortal
[17:36] must put on immortality and we see that
[17:38] god
[17:39] by this eternal redemption we know that
[17:42] by the baptism of the holy ghost you and
[17:44] i are now
[17:45] eternal in our soul sitting in heavenly
[17:47] places with christ jesus
[17:52] but this thing's not
[17:55] this is the one you got to work on or
[17:56] we're going to have to do the ashes to
[17:59] ashes dust to dust thing everybody got
[18:01] that
[18:02] because we're heading toward a grave
[18:05] we're heading toward it
[18:07] i didn't say we had to get in it
[18:09] i said we're heading toward it
[18:11] because there's going to be somebody now
[18:12] read your bible roll it back down
[18:15] and
[18:17] we shall not all sleep
[18:21] so there had to be a message
[18:25] come
[18:27] not above and beyond man's comprehension
[18:30] but above and beyond man's comprehension
[18:34] you understand what i mean
[18:37] because how many people's heard we're
[18:38] all gonna die
[18:39] you all gonna die
[18:42] we all gonna die well somebody is and
[18:44] they do it every day but somebody is
[18:46] gonna have to fulfill this first
[18:47] corinthians 15.
[18:49] and then another scripture where he says
[18:51] we shall he says we alive we which are
[18:53] alive and remain to the coming the lord
[18:55] shall not what prevent or hinder those
[18:57] which are asleep for the trumpet of god
[18:59] there is that trumpet again
[19:01] now what is a trumpet as we look and see
[19:03] trumpet trumpet is a message
[19:06] what does a trumpet do it sounds a
[19:08] battle it actually gives you
[19:09] communication back when there was no
[19:12] communication you know the old indians
[19:14] used to do the smoke signals
[19:16] but back when there was a trumpet there
[19:18] was a certain sound that a trumpet made
[19:20] to either charge or retreat because your
[19:23] battleground was spread out all over
[19:26] miles
[19:27] and you couldn't communicate that quick
[19:29] but if you blew that trumpet and it was
[19:30] the right sound
[19:32] you knew what to do
[19:34] you'd have to have somebody you knew
[19:36] what to do when you heard when you heard
[19:38] the message
[19:40] you did what the trumpet said
[19:42] so that's what we're not looking for
[19:44] we're not looking for a trumpet that
[19:45] stands out outside in a in a graveyard
[19:47] into dootin and you see this arm push up
[19:50] out of the
[19:52] no come on
[19:54] that's silly that's old wives tales
[19:57] it has no foundation in the bible i
[19:59] promise you that
[20:01] so now let's go to revelations 4 1.
[20:05] try to hurry through this
[20:08] but i want to kind of background a
[20:09] little bit
[20:10] because now that we see i tell you what
[20:11] pulls chart up the first chart not the
[20:13] daniel 70 which chart pulled the first
[20:15] chart up that i did
[20:17] a long time ago
[20:19] and this is what we're looking at now
[20:22] just pull it up just there you go
[20:24] so we got jesus resurrected
[20:27] he goes to hell and preached to the
[20:29] souls in prisons according to matthew
[20:31] 27.
[20:32] all right now he's here for 40 days
[20:35] acts one verse three what happens jesus
[20:38] ascends
[20:39] he takes that glorified body up into
[20:42] another dimension
[20:43] right
[20:44] then he sends not the body back
[20:47] he sends the holy spirit back that was
[20:49] the motivator inside of him he sends it
[20:51] back on the day of pentecost they're
[20:52] buying all right with that
[20:54] amen what'd i tell y'all about amen
[20:57] when we got visitors
[21:04] sometimes you say stuff and they're like
[21:06] nobody says hey man and the visitors are
[21:07] going they don't believe what he's
[21:09] saying either
[21:13] but we do i know you do
[21:15] you wouldn't be sitting here every
[21:16] sunday if you didn't
[21:18] hey man
[21:19] okay what
[21:21] that's what i thought goodness gracious
[21:24] we need to go hannah can you come teach
[21:26] this class it's like kindergarten
[21:29] okay so he says the holy ghost back on
[21:31] the day of pentecost and it's the new
[21:33] birth because your first birth was wrong
[21:36] amen you needed a new birth he said
[21:38] nicodemus you must be
[21:40] born again
[21:42] from where above not from your mom and
[21:45] daddy because look what he said in his
[21:46] carnal mind
[21:48] i got to go back and get in my mama's
[21:49] womb and be birthed again jesus said no
[21:52] that's your problem
[21:53] you came out the first time
[21:55] right
[21:56] but you need to be birthed from above
[21:58] and that's what happened on the day of
[21:59] pentecost
[22:00] 120 little sons of god
[22:04] i'll build my church jesus said on this
[22:06] rock revelation i'll bribe i'll build my
[22:08] church to revelation that god did come
[22:11] back not as the third person of a
[22:13] trinity sorry
[22:15] no such thing in the bible
[22:18] we don't believe that cutting him up in
[22:19] three pieces it was the same person
[22:21] in the form of the holy ghost and what
[22:23] in the believers as bob was talking
[22:25] about then then you've got people that
[22:27] are
[22:28] that are not angels with wings
[22:33] you've got earthly angels
[22:35] that come down and preach a sermon that
[22:37] come down according to revelations one
[22:39] two and three that you see ephesus
[22:41] smyrna pergamus thytara
[22:44] and and well know that that we know more
[22:47] about wesley and lutheran wesley and and
[22:49] the prophet in the end time than we do
[22:51] all these others but remember they had
[22:53] to be here because of the gentile church
[22:56] age is everybody okay with that well
[22:58] there is a gentile listen god's not
[23:00] dealing with the jews at the moment
[23:04] now he may be dealing with them
[23:05] individually
[23:06] and birthing them in the body of christ
[23:09] as born-again christians but not as the
[23:11] nation of israel
[23:15] paul said blindness in part
[23:18] right
[23:19] has come to israel until the gentile
[23:22] nations in other words be gathered
[23:23] together and we take a rapture just like
[23:25] we're going to read here in revelations
[23:28] 4 1.
[23:29] so after the church ages are over
[23:32] excuse me there's going to be a
[23:33] resurrection
[23:36] and then after that resurrection then
[23:37] what are we going to have according to
[23:39] revelations 4 1. let's go to there now
[23:47] this is john on patmos he said after
[23:48] this i looked and behold a door was
[23:50] opened in heaven
[23:51] and the first voice which i heard as it
[23:53] were a trumpet talking with me said come
[23:55] up hither see there's no word there's no
[23:57] rapture word in the bible it's catching
[24:00] away or coming up all right
[24:03] remember rapture is
[24:05] ecstasy or the epitome of what something
[24:07] is going on the rapture is going to
[24:09] happen because we come up
[24:11] because we're raptured out of this
[24:13] out of this age come up hither look and
[24:16] i will show these things which must be
[24:17] hereafter and immediately i was in the
[24:19] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[24:20] heaven and three sat on the throne
[24:24] what'd that say
[24:26] one said on the throne amen
[24:29] one said on the throne all right so now
[24:31] the church age is over
[24:33] the bride's in glory according to the
[24:35] bible we don't go through the
[24:37] tribulation
[24:41] y'all have y'all forgot what i just said
[24:43] a minute ago
[24:48] hard group today
[24:54] so let's go back to the chart
[24:57] so we've been raptured so we're out of
[24:59] here so now what happens is god turns
[25:01] where
[25:02] according to revelations
[25:04] 7
[25:06] is that right
[25:07] according to revelation 7.
[25:11] in revelations
[25:13] 11
[25:15] he gets two witnesses right here there's
[25:17] two prophets
[25:19] see we're not scared of prophets
[25:21] they're good for us
[25:23] revelations 11 there's two prophets
[25:29] there's two prophets that come on the
[25:30] scene but let's go to matthew
[25:32] 24 21 because
[25:36] when the church leaves now when the
[25:37] bride leaves
[25:40] god is going to turn to the jews
[25:42] according to revelations 11 right
[25:44] all right so that's what's going to
[25:46] happen and what's going to happen to the
[25:48] foolish virgin remember the foolish
[25:50] virgin had to stay here because the
[25:53] bridegroom call came
[25:55] the the wise virgins left
[25:58] left the foolish virgins here and there
[26:00] was weeping wailing and gnashing of
[26:02] teeth that's right amen so it wasn't a
[26:04] really nice place that they found
[26:06] themselves in because they didn't have
[26:08] the holy ghost okay and then what god
[26:10] does is he removes himself from the
[26:12] gentile church and he goes and opens the
[26:14] eyes of the jews
[26:16] because he promised to in revelation 11.
[26:19] but now let's go to back to the chart i
[26:21] mean let's go back to
[26:23] matthew
[26:24] go to the next one
[26:28] now the tribulation now watch this is
[26:30] matthew 24 this is jesus speaking he
[26:32] says for then shall be great tribulation
[26:35] now look we have tribulation every day
[26:36] this this virus and all this stuff and
[26:39] work is tribulation
[26:44] some of you that don't have to go to
[26:45] work tomorrow
[26:51] but we have tr we have tribulation but
[26:52] not a great tribulation
[26:54] this great tribulation is the wrath of
[26:56] god poured out upon a
[26:58] sinning world
[27:02] they're sinning now with us in it but
[27:03] the reason that god's not pouring out
[27:05] his complete wrath is because what his
[27:07] bride's here
[27:08] his children are still here amen i mean
[27:10] we're still here but once we leave
[27:13] he's only going to deal with 144 000
[27:16] right the whole world is going to be in
[27:18] chaos they're just going to start
[27:20] well it'll be a lawless world
[27:23] you know man's good
[27:26] as long as there's a law
[27:30] because without a law
[27:33] for then shall be great tribulation such
[27:35] as was not since the beginning of the
[27:36] world to this time nor ever shall be and
[27:39] except those days should be shortened
[27:41] thank god there should be no flesh be
[27:43] saved for the elect say those days shall
[27:46] be shortened so who's the elect us
[27:48] we're the elect of god we're the ones
[27:50] that are holding off the wrath of god
[27:53] and we once we get out of here though
[27:54] it's not going to hold the wrath of god
[27:57] and it's going to be
[28:01] let's go to revelation 2. we'll see
[28:06] now jesus is talking he says now
[28:08] because remember on the isle of patmos
[28:11] john was commissioned to write what he
[28:12] saw
[28:14] all right and then the one standing in
[28:16] the midst of the golden candle sticks
[28:17] like unto the son of man he was the one
[28:18] that was talking to john who was that
[28:20] that was jesus christ all right
[28:23] notwithstanding i have a few things
[28:25] against thee because thou suffers that
[28:27] woman jezebel
[28:28] who called herself a prophetess remember
[28:31] she elevated herself
[28:33] in israel and ahab was just as bad as
[28:36] she was
[28:38] but watch what this is because remember
[28:40] a woman is a type of the what church
[28:42] always a woman is the type of the church
[28:44] in the bible
[28:46] this woman jezebel which calls herself a
[28:48] prophetess to teach and seduce
[28:50] my servants to commit fornication now
[28:52] look that's not natural
[28:55] you take any other doctrine besides the
[28:57] true doctrine of the bible you're
[28:59] committing fornication that's what the
[29:00] bible says
[29:01] and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[29:03] and i gave her space to repent how long
[29:06] did he give her 2 000 years
[29:10] 2 000 years to repent of all the junk
[29:13] that we went through
[29:15] i mean god's not this confused
[29:19] but look what happened
[29:21] she repented not
[29:24] the church
[29:26] nominal
[29:28] repented not
[29:29] behold i who's i god
[29:33] jesus christ i will cast her into a bed
[29:37] and then that commit adultery with her
[29:40] into
[29:41] great tribulation
[29:43] except
[29:45] they repented their deeds you've still
[29:46] got a little chance left
[29:48] amen
[29:50] so let's go to revelation 13 4.
[29:52] now this is what's going to happen
[29:54] the way we see it according to the bible
[29:56] after we leave
[29:58] that this is what's going to happen and
[29:59] they worship the dragon now it's not a
[30:01] dragon
[30:04] it's a symbol
[30:06] of a person with some authority and
[30:08] power
[30:10] which gave power into the beast it's not
[30:12] some big beast standing up there listen
[30:14] folks let me tell you something all
[30:15] these analogies that we see in the bible
[30:18] now
[30:18] probably uncle marshall could go through
[30:20] them better than i could but that's not
[30:22] going to be a beast like a beast like an
[30:24] animal it's it's a symbol of a person
[30:27] with power
[30:28] everybody got that
[30:29] because remember what does a horn mean
[30:31] in the bible power what does water in
[30:33] the bible mean many people tongues and
[30:35] nations so god is using these symbols
[30:39] and they worship the beast it must be
[30:41] one person
[30:43] saying who is locking to the beast who
[30:45] is able to make war with him so there
[30:47] somebody's going to rise up
[30:52] and listen
[30:53] he's not going to look like a beast
[30:56] he's a slicker
[30:59] uncle john satan is not a red guy with a
[31:01] tail
[31:05] he's met a few maybe
[31:07] but he's a slick guy he's deceived
[31:09] everybody but just a few a little group
[31:11] of people
[31:13] a deceiver is somebody that's so close
[31:15] to the very
[31:16] thing that you're worshiping
[31:18] remember he wanted to be like god
[31:21] then he says in the temple as god in the
[31:23] end
[31:24] as the beast that has power
[31:27] because who's going to be able to make
[31:28] war with him we're talking about this
[31:29] whole world
[31:32] who's going to be able to make war with
[31:33] this guy
[31:36] and there was given unto him a mouth
[31:37] speaking great things in blasphemies and
[31:40] power was given unto him to continue how
[31:42] long
[31:43] 42 months how long is that three and a
[31:46] half years
[31:47] same time that the two witnesses are
[31:49] preaching their gospel to the 144
[31:52] thousand that's right
[31:54] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[31:56] against god into blasphemous name and
[31:58] his tabernacle on them that dwell in
[32:00] heaven and it was given unto him to make
[32:02] war with the saints and to overcome them
[32:03] and power was given unto
[32:05] him over all kindred tongues and nations
[32:08] this guy's pretty powerful
[32:10] and he's a slicker though
[32:12] he's going to bring you into not the
[32:13] bible say with flattery
[32:15] oh it's just come to my church it'll be
[32:18] all right
[32:19] wait a minute you did stop
[32:21] and all that dwell upon the earth look
[32:23] all right
[32:25] amen can i get it amen
[32:28] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[32:31] worship him
[32:33] not god
[32:35] whose names are not written in the book
[32:38] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[32:40] foundation
[32:41] of the world
[32:43] all
[32:44] will worship this man
[32:46] thinking he's a religious head of
[32:49] something
[32:50] you can call it the pope or whatever
[32:52] whoever you want to call it i don't care
[32:54] we're not going to be here to see it
[32:56] we're going to be gone
[32:58] amen we're going to be out of here we're
[33:00] not going to worry about this
[33:01] because everybody else is going to be
[33:03] deceived by him look
[33:04] except those whose names
[33:07] are written
[33:08] the ones that are not written is going
[33:09] to be deceived the ones that's names in
[33:11] the book of life which is what
[33:14] the genesis 21 26 person
[33:17] his own children all right let's go to
[33:19] revelation 3 now and see what happens
[33:22] now god says and i will give power unto
[33:24] my two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[33:26] one thousand
[33:27] two hundred and three score days clothed
[33:29] in sackcloth now how long is that
[33:31] three and a half years you say no that
[33:33] don't add up remember
[33:36] god's calendar is 30 days not 31 and 29
[33:40] and 28. god's calendar's 30 day calendar
[33:43] all right
[33:44] so 30 days into that will be three and a
[33:46] half years 42 months
[33:48] these are the two olive trees now what
[33:50] olive always is
[33:52] israel
[33:54] the two olive trees and the two
[33:56] candlesticks standing before the god of
[33:58] the earth
[33:59] and if any man will hurt them fire now
[34:01] listen they're not fire breathing
[34:03] dragons
[34:05] what is fire
[34:07] god's anointing that what they say is
[34:09] going to come to pass
[34:12] fire proceeded out of their mouth and
[34:14] devoureth their enemies and if any man
[34:16] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[34:18] killed remember i said before don't you
[34:20] think these two witnesses are going to
[34:21] pop on the scene
[34:22] people hate israel anyway
[34:25] they're going to really hate them when
[34:26] we leave
[34:27] but these two witnesses are going to
[34:28] stand right in the middle of that
[34:31] and they're going to preach jesus christ
[34:34] and the mossad the fbi the kgb the cia
[34:38] they're all going to want to kill these
[34:39] two men
[34:41] and you know what they're going to try
[34:43] because if any man will hurt them he
[34:44] must in this manner
[34:46] be killed these have power to what shut
[34:48] heaven
[34:49] now who shut heaven in the days of the
[34:51] old testament
[34:53] one more time
[34:54] thank you elijah
[34:56] that it rained not in the days of their
[34:57] prophecy and have power over waters to
[34:59] turn into blood what man turned into
[35:01] blood
[35:02] let everybody else talk okay you're
[35:04] right up here in the front
[35:06] it's always the kids in the front
[35:09] oh
[35:10] but no who turned the water to blood
[35:12] moses all right so so the spirit of
[35:14] moses and elijah will not be the two men
[35:16] it will be the spirit of moses and
[35:17] elijah
[35:19] that will go to because listen
[35:22] whether we believe in prophets or not
[35:25] israel surely believes in them
[35:27] they are looking for elijah according to
[35:29] malachi 4 before the great and terrible
[35:31] day of the lord they're looking for an
[35:33] elijah to show up
[35:35] and as i preached a long time ago
[35:37] remember that they put a cup when they
[35:40] have their sedar or the end of their
[35:41] year they put a cup there and it's not
[35:44] not got anything in it
[35:46] but they're waiting on elijah to show up
[35:49] they go out in the yard and they look
[35:51] this way and they look this way and if
[35:52] they don't see a man walking down the
[35:53] road it looks like elijah they take the
[35:55] cup put it back up on the shelf and say
[35:56] until next year
[35:58] so they're looking for elijah so when
[36:00] this man comes on the scene that's able
[36:02] to shut the heaven their mind is going
[36:04] to go back to that old testament they're
[36:06] going to say elijah is finally here
[36:08] but they're going to think the messiah
[36:11] is coming to get them
[36:14] right
[36:15] but remember they were blinded and
[36:17] messiah's already come
[36:20] but the revelation is going to be when
[36:21] god pulls the
[36:23] veil off of israel's eyes because
[36:25] blindness was given to them in part for
[36:27] me and you
[36:29] but when they start doing this
[36:32] the whole world's going to see it but
[36:33] there's going to be 144 000 and we'll
[36:35] read that here in just a minute or maybe
[36:37] i took that out but remember the bible
[36:39] says that there's a 12 000 out of each
[36:41] tribe 12 times 12 is hold on 12 times 12
[36:44] is what
[36:45] you got it right
[36:48] she didn't hear what she didn't hear
[36:49] what i said the other day so that's okay
[36:52] yeah 144 000 12 000 out of each tribe
[36:56] and when they shall have finished their
[36:57] testimony in other words after 42 months
[37:00] the beast that ascendeth out of the
[37:01] bottomless pit shall make war now it's
[37:03] not going to beast is not going to climb
[37:05] out of a pit you understand what i mean
[37:08] it's that man that's been in power the
[37:10] whole time but he's he can't kill them
[37:12] because of the 1260-day prophecy
[37:16] right
[37:17] but once that 1260-day prophecy is over
[37:19] the
[37:20] anointing comes off the two witnesses
[37:22] and he is able to what
[37:24] kill him all right so he's going to kill
[37:26] them
[37:27] all right so now let's go to daniel 9
[37:30] verse 24.
[37:33] we might not get to the millennium today
[37:35] that's okay
[37:36] daniel 9 24 remember the book of daniel
[37:40] it's the same as the book of revelations
[37:42] to me and you the book of daniel is the
[37:43] same prophecy that gives
[37:45] israel their prophecy in the end time
[37:48] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[37:50] and upon thy holy city to do six things
[37:53] finish the transgression of who israel
[37:56] this is not me and you we're already
[37:57] gone
[37:58] all right
[37:59] to make an end of sins to make
[38:01] reconciliation for iniquity to bring in
[38:03] everlasting righteousness seal up the
[38:05] vision and prophecy and to anoint the
[38:08] most holy so there's 70 weeks and we
[38:10] know instead of going through all the
[38:11] whole long dissertation it wasn't 70
[38:15] exact weeks it was 70 times 7
[38:18] which is 490 years
[38:21] and it's kind of strange that
[38:24] that a man looked at jesus one time and
[38:25] says how many times
[38:27] do i need to forgive my brother
[38:29] seven times
[38:31] jesus said 70
[38:33] times seven which is 490 years that's
[38:36] how long he give for israel to repent
[38:39] everybody good with that
[38:41] amen
[38:43] thank you sister
[38:49] so now what are they going to go through
[38:50] though
[38:52] let's stop for a minute so they're going
[38:53] to be 70 weeks to determine we know that
[38:55] 69 weeks is already over with there's
[38:57] one week left
[38:58] there was a gentile church age put in
[39:00] between there all right
[39:03] because god's not dealing with the jews
[39:05] as a nation now none at all right
[39:07] not at all he's only dealing with with
[39:09] the gentiles but when he leaves the
[39:12] gentile goes to the jews
[39:15] they're going to those two prophets
[39:16] prophesy 1260 days according
[39:20] to the bible
[39:22] and but what's going to happen during
[39:24] that time let's go to the next
[39:26] go to the next scripture which is
[39:28] jeremiah 30
[39:30] verse 7 and i kind of flew through this
[39:32] wednesday night and i'll kind of stop
[39:34] just a minute
[39:36] it says the last for that great day day
[39:38] is great so that none is like it
[39:40] it is even the time of jacob's trouble
[39:42] now this bible talks about who was jacob
[39:45] he's a jew
[39:47] jacob was jew all right now remember
[39:49] what does jacob's name mean in the bible
[39:52] shyster
[39:54] remember his name was changed to israel
[39:56] because he wrestled with god just like
[39:58] me and you get a name changed when we
[39:59] wrestle with god and wrestle without get
[40:01] the new birth we're called christians
[40:03] all right
[40:05] so it is even the time of jacob's
[40:07] trouble
[40:08] because he was a shyster remember he
[40:10] stole the birthright he did all those
[40:12] things wrong when he was a young guy
[40:14] look he was a
[40:15] he was a con man of the con man
[40:19] him and his him and his father-in-law
[40:21] laban were the two of the best con men
[40:22] they couldn't go to las vegas they'd
[40:24] kick them out
[40:27] because they conned each other the whole
[40:28] time
[40:30] i mean jacob had to con him to get lea
[40:32] to get rachel and work seven years and
[40:35] and somehow laban slipped leon
[40:39] somehow i don't know how that happened
[40:41] but then he had to marry her and then he
[40:43] had to work seven more years so anyway
[40:45] you see jacob's trouble but look but he
[40:47] shall be saved out of it now we can go
[40:49] into the old testament and we did
[40:52] how many times god told israel said i've
[40:54] divorced you
[40:55] you've went whoring you've done other
[40:57] things that you're not you've you've
[40:59] worshipped other gods you've moloch and
[41:02] and and bell elbow bell
[41:05] bell
[41:05] and all those
[41:07] they worship those people
[41:09] right
[41:11] so god said i'm gonna put you away
[41:13] but i'm not gonna forget you
[41:15] you're my people you're the one i
[41:17] started with
[41:19] you're my people i'm not going to deny
[41:21] you or get rid of you
[41:23] but you're going to go through jacob's
[41:24] trouble
[41:26] you're going to go through persecution
[41:27] just like when we do something wrong as
[41:29] a christian what do we go through
[41:30] persecution amen
[41:32] but he shall look but here's the promise
[41:34] but he shall be saved out of it how
[41:37] by the two witnesses going to preach to
[41:39] 144 000 in israel and save them
[41:43] from their sins
[41:45] they're going to preach what jesus
[41:46] christ
[41:48] a jesus christ that they've already
[41:50] crucified because remember they said and
[41:52] i think i took it out but remember they
[41:54] say where'd you get those scars he said
[41:55] in the house of my friends
[41:57] so they mourn and just like
[41:59] when jacob revealed i mean when joseph
[42:01] was it revealed himself
[42:03] to his brothers all right
[42:05] for it shall come to pass in that day
[42:07] now we're reading the bible saith the
[42:09] lord of hosts that i will break his yoke
[42:10] from off thy neck and will burst our
[42:13] bonds
[42:14] and the stranger shall no more serve
[42:16] themselves of him
[42:17] remember what did god tell him
[42:20] he said i'm going to
[42:22] because we're going to read this in a
[42:22] minute god said israel i'm going to stat
[42:25] scatter you all over the world
[42:28] right
[42:29] i'm going to destroy your temple
[42:31] remember the temple was destroyed like
[42:33] 16 different times every time they'd
[42:35] build it somebody tear it down because
[42:36] they hated them jews listen they knew if
[42:38] those jews had a temple
[42:40] god was going to come to that temple so
[42:42] if they destroyed the temple they didn't
[42:43] have to destroy the people they had to
[42:44] destroy they destroyed the temple
[42:47] but look at them so he dispersed them
[42:50] but they they're back now in their
[42:51] homeland remember
[42:53] but they shall serve the lord their god
[42:55] and david their king who i will raise up
[42:56] unto them therefore fear they are not o
[42:59] my servant jacob saith the lord neither
[43:02] be dismayed o israel
[43:05] for lo i will save thee from afar and
[43:07] thy seed from the land of their
[43:10] captivity when he dispersed the jews he
[43:13] sent them into all nations
[43:16] right
[43:17] then russia kicked them out
[43:19] then germany tried to kill them all
[43:24] the only thing they feel safe over here
[43:26] is because we don't persecute them like
[43:27] like the other people do
[43:29] but they're rich people
[43:31] the jews are rich people inherently they
[43:33] just they're they're business people and
[43:35] the world hates them because they got
[43:36] money
[43:39] i mean really look you read about hitler
[43:40] hitler really didn't hate the jews for
[43:42] being a jew they hated the jews because
[43:43] he had all they had all the money and he
[43:45] was trying to fund his
[43:47] campaign of war and they said you can
[43:50] fund it all you want to but you're not
[43:51] using our money so that's okay he said
[43:53] i'll just kill you and take it
[43:54] that's what he did six million of them
[43:58] and jacob shall return and shall be in
[44:01] rest we're heading into the millennium
[44:03] which is a rest
[44:04] and be quiet and none shall make him
[44:06] afraid for i am
[44:08] with thee saith the lord to save thee
[44:11] though i make look
[44:15] every nation is going to that battle of
[44:17] armageddon
[44:19] according to the bible
[44:20] according to daniel you've got the ten
[44:22] kingdoms that come together
[44:25] under this one head of whoever you want
[44:27] to call him
[44:28] pope
[44:29] or whoever
[44:30] which is the beast
[44:32] and they're going to be they're going to
[44:34] be very powerful and try to take over
[44:36] the world but look god said look do i
[44:38] make full end of all nations whether i
[44:41] have scattered thee
[44:44] in other words he's going to make full
[44:45] end to the united states russia china
[44:50] yet will i not make full end of thee
[44:55] what a promise
[44:56] but i will correct the in measure and
[44:59] will not leave the altogether unpunished
[45:01] he hadn't look how the jews have been
[45:02] persecuted since they hung him on a
[45:04] cross
[45:06] by the millions they've been killed just
[45:08] because they're jews
[45:09] that's why i thank god in the fifth seal
[45:11] that there's a fifth sealed jew that's
[45:13] given eternal life given white robes
[45:15] for their stand of who they are
[45:18] they'll be okay with that
[45:22] it's the word you got that right
[45:24] now look
[45:27] let's go to revelation 6 verse 12. and i
[45:30] think we'll
[45:32] we'll continue this afternoon we got
[45:34] plenty of time this afternoon not so
[45:35] much this morning
[45:38] but we hadn't even got to the
[45:39] tribulation we got part of the
[45:40] tribulation now look now beheld when he
[45:43] had opened the sixth seal now this is
[45:44] the bible although there was a great
[45:46] earthquake
[45:48] the sun became black as sackcloth of
[45:49] hair and the moon became blood
[45:52] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[45:53] earth now we've not seen the day like
[45:54] that have we
[45:56] no no
[45:57] okay
[45:58] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[45:59] earth and even as a fig tree cast as her
[46:01] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[46:03] mighty wind
[46:04] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[46:06] it was rolled together sounds like some
[46:07] kind of nuclear something didn't it
[46:09] and every mountain and ireland were
[46:10] moved out of their places
[46:12] and the kings of the earth and the great
[46:14] men
[46:15] and the rich men
[46:17] and the chief captains
[46:19] we look up to all these people and
[46:21] that's okay to give honor where owners
[46:22] do but just because bill gates has got
[46:25] 70 something billion dollars that don't
[46:26] make him a christian he's going to be a
[46:29] part of this group right here if he
[46:30] don't get if he don't if he don't repent
[46:33] let's just be let's just be real
[46:36] we all going to come to a place where
[46:39] nothing you got here is going to do you
[46:41] any good except what's inside of you
[46:44] amen
[46:45] and the mighty men and every bondman and
[46:47] every freeman they hid themselves in
[46:49] dens and in the rocks of the mountains
[46:51] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[46:52] on us and hide us from the face of him
[46:55] that sitteth on the throne there's that
[46:56] one sitting on the throne and from the
[46:58] wrath of the lamb for the great day of
[47:00] his wrath has come and who
[47:02] shall be able
[47:04] to stand
[47:06] who
[47:07] shall be able
[47:09] to stand
[47:11] there's nobody going to be able to stand
[47:14] let's read revelations let's let's skip
[47:16] the
[47:17] let's skip that quote
[47:18] let's go to revelation 7 verse 1. now
[47:20] watch
[47:22] and after these things i saw four angels
[47:25] standing on the four corners of the
[47:26] earth holding the four winds of the
[47:29] earth now what does winds mean in the
[47:31] bible
[47:32] war
[47:33] they're holding the four wars
[47:36] that the wind should not blow on the
[47:38] earth
[47:38] nor on the sea or any tree
[47:40] and i saw another angel ascend from the
[47:43] east
[47:44] having the seal of the living god and he
[47:46] cried with a loud voice to the four
[47:48] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[47:50] earth and the sea saying hurt not the
[47:52] earth
[47:52] neither the sea
[47:54] nor the trees
[47:57] in other words there's not going to be a
[47:58] last war until
[48:01] those 144 000 are sealed
[48:04] we think we've been through we've been
[48:06] through world war one world war ii korea
[48:09] vietnam
[48:10] the skirmish that was over in
[48:11] afghanistan to different places but
[48:14] they're looking at a battle of
[48:15] armageddon it's going to destroy
[48:16] everything and god's not going to let
[48:17] that happen
[48:18] until we leave
[48:20] and the 144 000 leave because look i'm
[48:23] going to take what he promised he said
[48:25] till we have sealed the servants of our
[48:28] god in their foreheads now remember we
[48:30] talked about
[48:31] last week about the mark of the beast
[48:35] the mark of the beast is not the virus
[48:37] the mark of the beast is not the
[48:39] shot
[48:41] the mark of the beast is not a tattoo
[48:46] the mark of the beast is in your
[48:48] forehead
[48:49] it's your attitude toward god in his
[48:51] word
[48:53] amen
[48:54] you know i'm going to find this 666
[48:56] tattooed somewhere on everybody's body
[48:58] are they gonna i remember when when the
[49:00] barcodes came out years ago
[49:02] everybody say oh that's the mark of the
[49:03] bees
[49:04] no
[49:06] the mark of the beast is that beast
[49:08] that's going to make you think you're so
[49:11] religious
[49:14] and you're worshiping the devil
[49:17] amen
[49:18] and without the holy ghost you're still
[49:20] worshipping him now
[49:22] i don't i'm not going to get loud i got
[49:23] older people in the building
[49:26] i'm trying to i'm conserving my
[49:28] energy this afternoon i may let loose
[49:31] but i heard the number of them which
[49:33] were sealed now what is sealed the
[49:35] baptism of the holy ghost right
[49:37] remember
[49:38] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[49:39] whereby you are
[49:41] sealed until the day of your redemption
[49:43] so he has to seal the 144 000 preach a
[49:47] message to him through two prophets they
[49:49] accept jesus christ they know that they
[49:52] killed him two thousand years ago they
[49:54] said oh we're in so much big trouble and
[49:56] what does two witnesses say don't worry
[49:58] it was done to preserve life
[50:01] it was done to preserve the gentile
[50:03] bride now they're gone now we're gonna
[50:06] preach salvation to you
[50:08] a hundred and forty four thousand of all
[50:11] the tribes of the children of
[50:13] israel all right
[50:15] so that has nothing to do with gentiles
[50:17] that's right that's the two witnesses
[50:19] preaching
[50:20] 1260 days
[50:22] and they're going to seal 144 000
[50:24] because remember god doesn't deal with
[50:27] israel as individuals that's right he
[50:30] deals with israel as a nation he deals
[50:32] with gentiles as individuals tom many
[50:36] tongues nations you're going to read in
[50:37] many a couple of scriptures we're going
[50:39] to read not now but later on where
[50:41] there's this multitude of people comes
[50:43] up
[50:44] and they said john who is these people
[50:46] he said i don't know
[50:49] and the angel said well i know who it is
[50:51] he says the ones come out of tribulation
[50:53] the ones just give their life for god
[50:55] and all these different things because
[50:56] you know what john didn't know because
[50:57] he was a jew
[50:59] they were the gentile church age all
[51:01] right everybody okay with that
[51:04] all right let's go right here and then
[51:05] we'll stop
[51:09] what's the next one
[51:13] all right so let's stop we're gonna
[51:14] we'll do this and then we'll stop right
[51:15] here magicians get ready to come
[51:17] and he's he who's this he
[51:22] all right according to the according to
[51:24] what we we read in the bible
[51:27] am i okay with that according to what we
[51:29] read in the bible god will never break a
[51:32] covenant
[51:34] god cannot break a covenant
[51:36] he's a covenant maker we're the covenant
[51:39] breaker
[51:40] right he made a covenant with god in the
[51:42] old testament i mean he made a covenant
[51:44] with adam in the old testament he said
[51:45] eat that tree don't eat that one you eat
[51:48] this one you'll live you eat that when
[51:49] you'll die right
[51:50] now who broke the covenant god didn't
[51:53] man went over there and ate that tree
[51:54] and got and god said okay you broke your
[51:57] covenant now you're going out to die
[51:59] but what do you do with abraham though
[52:00] he said abraham i will
[52:03] so it's an unconditional covenant that's
[52:05] what me and you live under now is an
[52:06] unconditional covenant
[52:09] by grace are you saved through faith
[52:11] all right
[52:13] so this he person right here is going to
[52:15] break this covenant
[52:18] because look he shall confirm the
[52:19] covenant with many for one week
[52:22] which one week equals
[52:24] seven years
[52:26] and in the midst of the week in three
[52:28] and a half years that he's that he's
[52:30] letting these two witnesses preach
[52:32] because he can't do nothing about it
[52:33] because the bible says he's not going to
[52:34] do anything about it he can't because
[52:36] they got an anointing on them right
[52:38] so in the midst of the week which what's
[52:40] in the midst of seven three and a half
[52:43] he shall cause the sacrifice an oblation
[52:45] to cease and for the overspreading of
[52:47] abominations he shall make it desolate
[52:50] who's this he that's the antichrist
[52:52] that's the beast that's the pope that's
[52:54] to whoever you want to call him
[52:56] he comes in and says i'm
[52:59] israel says no you're not
[53:02] he says i'll show you i'm god and he'll
[53:04] perform signs and wonders
[53:06] and everybody that's not sealed of those
[53:08] 144 000 will just fall right in line
[53:12] amen
[53:14] because without the baptism of the holy
[53:15] ghost you're serving the devil anyway
[53:19] i don't care who you are
[53:20] there's not no
[53:22] gray area in god
[53:24] you're either born again or you're not
[53:26] amen
[53:29] for the overspreading of abomination he
[53:30] shall make it desolate even until the
[53:32] consummation what is the consummation
[53:35] that whole last week of daniel 70 weeks
[53:38] if 69 weeks was before at calvary then
[53:40] there's one week left for the jews
[53:43] we're in the middle of it now this is
[53:44] where we're at we're in the middle of it
[53:46] now they prophesied three and a half
[53:48] years and then they're killed in the
[53:50] streets of jerusalem remember we read
[53:51] that last sunday
[53:53] let's read it now revelations 11 7 and
[53:55] we'll stop right there
[53:57] and when they shall have finished their
[53:59] testimony the beast that ascendeth out
[54:02] of the bottomless pit shall make war
[54:03] against them and shall overcome them and
[54:06] kill them and their dead bodies shall
[54:08] lie in the street of the great city
[54:10] which spiritually is called sodom where
[54:12] our lord was crucified where was he
[54:14] crucified jerusalem
[54:16] all right and they of the people and all
[54:18] kindred and tongue and nations shall see
[54:22] now this probably was hard for john to
[54:24] write
[54:27] because john didn't have cnn
[54:30] nbc
[54:31] cbs fox news reuters
[54:35] right
[54:36] because the whole world is going to see
[54:38] their dead bodies laying in that street
[54:40] the whole world's going to hate these
[54:42] two witnesses so bad
[54:44] until as soon as they die they're not
[54:46] even going to bury them so they're
[54:47] desecrating their body they're leaving
[54:49] them there for three and a half days
[54:52] three and a half what three and a half
[54:53] days
[54:54] and shall not suffer their dead bodies
[54:56] to be put in the grave and look and they
[54:57] that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice
[54:59] over them and make mary
[55:01] these people are crazy
[55:03] they just killed two men showed it to
[55:05] the whole world
[55:08] and you see them laying there and i'm
[55:09] sure the cameras are turned on them
[55:14] but here comes god
[55:17] he always comes on the scene
[55:20] and they that dwell upon the earth shall
[55:22] rejoice over them and make mary and
[55:23] shalt send gifts one to another
[55:26] they hated them
[55:29] because these two prophets tormented
[55:31] them
[55:33] that dwell on the earth but now remember
[55:35] they didn't torment 144 000.
[55:38] so the 144 000 is not in this group
[55:41] that's pro that's persecuting these two
[55:42] witnesses i believe they're being
[55:44] persecuted too you and i both do believe
[55:46] that
[55:46] and after three days and a half the
[55:48] spirit of life from god enters into them
[55:51] and they stand on their feet
[55:53] boy six o'clock news oh buddy
[55:56] yeah
[55:57] and they stood on their feet and great
[55:59] fear fell upon them which saw them and
[56:01] they heard a great voice from heaven
[56:02] saying unto them what do we read in
[56:04] revelations 4 come up hither
[56:08] in other words they're going to take a
[56:09] rapture they're going to get off the
[56:10] earth and they ascended up to heaven and
[56:13] the cloud and their enemies beheld them
