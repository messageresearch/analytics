========================================

open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i won't deceive you i shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy amen holy holy amen and amen and amen i want to see him don't you in a day in an hour and a time when everything's falling apart we have an opportunity to look into god's word and find him and be able to find him for ourselves and to walk in in the love of the lord it was a great day and a great time man remember the sick among us remember sister peggy gibeon and operation on her foot and everything and just remember that the lord would would be with her and bless her and take care of him he'd like to turn to our scripture we're reading in romans 7. now what we're doing is we're titling these to where that we're still in the series called marriage and divorce and we'll keep that point but then our thought is the invisible union so then we're moving on over and that's why we're not reading the scripture in matthew of marriage and divorce we're moving into the greater portion of marriage and divorce the moving into how that we're separated from the law so just keep those things in mind and then you know we'll have it all bunched up in one one thought or one series all right romans seven heavenly father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for calvary thank you for salvation thank you for peace and joy and love lord in you and we just ask you to have your way that you may lord guide each and every one of us into thy grace and love and lord that you would touch the sick among us because that's what we desire we desire to see you manifest yourself among us in a mighty way and lord just come and have your way you said you sent your word and healed us so we just believe you and we thank you have your way now god god each and every one forgive our sins and keep us in jesus name amen romans 7. no ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law and that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband lives she'll be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are come become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should walk excuse me that we should bring forth fruit under god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead were in we were hell that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the letter wholeness of the letter so you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word i said we're we're trying to get into what brother brown said paul was doing and you know getting into the greater portion of marriage and divorce and how that christ is to set us free and not to just be forgiven but wind up to a basis to where that we will be totally justified and then knowing that we're illustrating he was here in romans 7 illustrating the relationship the prophet said paragraph 43 of the invisible union said he's illustrating the relationship of bride to christ and you know then brother branham when he gets into it he says now i'm not talking about you women i'm just illustrating he said what you are is between you and the lord all right see we want to read the book and we just want to get in to do this don't do that and come to find out we're still under the law and that's what we're trying to do we're trying to to speak on these things to give us illustrations or understanding brown said it that paragraph 81 it says this is to show where the church stands the church the bride all right and if doing that then you know why would we be concerned with other things in trying to figure it out and all why not just believe what god says see paul is showing that the woman cannot divorce her husband and remarry on any ex circumstances except he be dead that's the only justificational point that the mother the woman has all right she's bound by the law now you say yeah but the law was done away in christ we're not under the law anymore well it's odd that paul was preaching to people that was already born again christians and that's what he was telling them you know and speaking like the law was still in existence you say yeah but but i don't understand you brother dale because you you you just don't preach like other people i agree with you i don't that's that's the difference in me and everybody else i guess but i'm trying to get you and i to see what we are today remember the bible is talking about what you and i are now what happened before if you're going to take the bible as a doing you might as well just rip out everything over to the book of revelations and hang on to about half of that because the rest of it is about somebody else well we we read it and we don't want it related but see it's all supposed to bring us all to a relationship with christ amen you know a salvation of doings but yet see we just we just want to take what we want to take and believe what we want to believe all right and then that way see we really get into trouble all right now remember how we were bringing out this past wednesday that even in verse 1 of romans 7 there it says that the man is under the law we say oh it's just a woman it's just a you know imagine divorce that's all just woman's side that's well go ahead and do what you want to because we've done been around here 50 years almost because of of misinterpreted theologies of mankind so i guess we got 50 more to go of course most of us ain't going to make it that way we're going to go by the grave we're going to march around horeb until this thing is all over with all right so we just might as well settle down and figure out we can go on or whatever we can do all right but remember we were bringing out where paul says it to man the that he's bound by the law as long as he liveth he he's not just talking about the ten commandments he's talking about the entire word of god because that's what we took the whole service about when you say law most people say ten commandments but the law is the bible the word of god the letter of the word is law until we're born again if we're not born again it's still law he said no no the law was done away with christ that's for the born-again believer the law wasn't done away when christ died the law was magnified it wasn't done away and he ended you say yeah but brother so-and-so i don't care what brother so-and-so said what does the bible say and what the prophet has to say we better get down to a seriousness of thinking it over because i tried to bring it out there wednesday and i'll keep trying to bring it out see we we want to take what somebody says well i remember a couple of guys named nathan and cora that made up their mind that they were spiritual also you know moses never argued with him about whether they were spiritual or not right he wanted everybody to be spiritual right he wanted everybody to experience god amen in the way that he had done all right anybody that's ever experienced god wants everybody else to see it that way but yet dathan and coracy they said you take too much upon yourself we the people are spiritual i mean there's really meaning unto them too was but they were saying it you know where it would go out and make everybody feel good because that's the way preachers are you know we we are the word but you got to come to me you know so that's law but you remember how it says there the man i told you in romans 7 then it's not saying that because that word is 44 44 let's see 444 i think it is in strong's it means for the word man in verse one it means a human being whether male or female generically or how you pronounce that word to include all human individuals in other words i've always tried to get you to see and you'll read where brother branham will say that that man that word man means mankind it's not just the man he's got a one way the woman's got another way you know but we're we're not bound by these things we're only bound by this well that's the problem my that's my whole thought now for the next six months is one thing brother branham said we are free from sin he said but we're bound by our creeds i don't have no creeds bless god well you just opened your mouth and said you had some yeah because by saying it that way you'd openly you you got offended some reason or something so it shows that that demon in there is teaching you those things is getting exposed right you wouldn't be that way now sorry to be blunt but isn't it time to be now think about it i'll have to got trying to go slow today my whole sinuses been acting up and i get to hollering very much i'll be like the little boy that told a preacher that time said you hotter than the church reason you can't talk so uh i'll try to slow down a little but now listen so then paul is speaking to mankind and he's saying mankind is bound by the law as long as he liveth well you just you just don't understand we're born again that's only in the soul you're not born again in your body and spirit you're still subject to life right subject to the law no the law is done away and beside us gentiles never was under the law you think that is not a doctrine go out and find out who finds you a good baptist and nothing else they'll tell you about it the law ended at calvary we and we never was under the law just the jews well how many doctrines is in the message like that all right now watch though paul is illustrating now he's illustrating that a man as long as he's immortal you know human being we are bound by the law which is a do's and don'ts point trying to do something to save ourselves as we'll get into in a minute this reason i had to cut off wednesday and just jump over and you know not cover these but then he goes on to illustrate even greater and he says that the the woman is bound to the law of her husband now we are supposed to be the bride of jesus christ right he is supposed to be our husband okay so now we're bound to the law of that husband which is the word of god which is every word of god see then when when we talk about it you know people say it's not in the new testament about women wearing britches that's an old testament scripture well i thought hebrews 13 8 said he was the same yesterday today and forever but i guess we missed that somewhere but think about it you and i now if you don't get anything out of this whole series get this one point whether you think it believe it whatever it is that's nothing to me i'm just the preacher if we think that there's anything that we didn't do or did do that brought us to salvation or born a certain way or a certain lineage or my mom and daddy was christians or whatnot if we think any of that that's the person i'm talking about if we think there's anything that we can do to save ourselves then salvation is not of the lord yeah but you you don't have got it written in here so go ahead you say but you don't want us to live good brother dale no i want you to get born again then we'll get down to where brother random says it like this he says is there anything we can do he said yes we can yield ourselves to god and live what he wants us to live see it's hard to preach the truth because people the way they pull you apart upon your thoughts and statements the prophet said no matter how much you holler and scream and shout he said make sure you walk straight when you come down now what's he saying do you think brother branham or the bible in any way ever had any reference to the fact that we could just live like the devil and it'd be all right paul said god forbid paul said whoever i yield myself to is my master but yet paul was a human that understood human things we'll get to romans 7 on over in a little more romans 8. and see we we're back in the denominations and then we they believed that paul never got born again until the eighth chapter of romans and he finally got saved you know because that that was the way that justified the fact of him talking about the things he would he did not the things he did it would not you know when i served it is that or so with the spirit i serve the law of the inward man but with the flesh i serve so i just can't help doing wrong well you think you live perfect you know what to say no because nobody can live perfect if we did we wouldn't need a savior yet if we don't serve god then we prove our loss how much more could anybody say brother dale don't preach on clothes and hide what else could i say but everyone said there's no way you could get a holy ghost for a woman to put on a pair of pants now quote a few more he said if you're a born-again christian you can't wait for the doors to open but yet we're just getting word that we used to think about having to build on the building i think now we need to rope off a couple of two or three back rows that's right you know see that's just the way we are but we're not under law so think about it now the law the letter of the word now the letter of the word will always be with us and will always be a form of condemnation brother brown said they didn't get what they thought they got he said they got god in a letter formed you know he calls the ten commandments to seals he said when the seals came and the commandments came he didn't have any trouble taking the old testament to apply it to the new testament did he but think on it now the law then as i tried to bring out wednesday and then i'll move on the law is the letter of god's word and the letter of god's word will never bring us to the letter now keeping the letter it's fine wonderful that's great but it'll never save us to keep the law to the letter could never save us yeah but it and it would it would make a wonderful person but could it be as we'll get to it a while or did it try to wednesday where paul said the thing i thought was life keeping the law to the letter he thought was life but he said i found it to be death he says in second corinthians 3 and 6 for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life see without the holy spirit see what they needed back there what they needed in the old testament was the new birth right you just think about those pharisees that had spent their whole life studying the word of god and all they done was talked about god and his word and yet he walked out there one day and they rejected him and killed him and he came exactly the way the word said he would come didn't it we see if they'd had the new birth what would have happened well we know it couldn't have come to jesus christ died we know that for certainty but i'm driving a point hard to think about it you just think about what it would be if you could have the new birth with an old testament person or a person that had studied the word what about the people in the land today that there's people that that can memorize and and quote the entire bible but yet where are they today well they're in church helping people helping people do what try to memorize something so you ain't listened evidently or some of you would at least amen some of you older ones that people used to they'd say you know well so and so they they died a bad part you throwing off on them you think you perfect i remember when he gave two dollars an offering plate he said oh that's silly yeah well i the other one was i remember when he painted the church and paved the parking lot so that gets down to more seriousness don't it you ever heard a preacher preach anybody into hell i've never heard one yet of you i mean literally preached somebody into hell they've always got a way to get them somewhere amen now listen why would israel is my point thank them is we tried to end up wednesday talking why would israel want the law when they had grace grace was waiting for law right come on they had an atonement they had a pillar of fire leading them they had a prophet to direct them and the spirit of god to dwell among them in a mighty wonderful way why would they want law that's what i said it's hard to even read during in in uh exodus and read that and look like it looks like there that god was giving it to him gonna make him take it brother ronan said that was the greatest mistake they made he said it was never the will of god to give the law we've got to quote flynn here we had them wednesday they'd just back away and come why would you want law when you got everything else now watch the two biggest mistakes israel ever made and this i wanted to borrow this on your heart they first wanted law something they could do that led them to wanting a king they never chose god never chose saul the people chose saul god chose david never joe saul but you see brother branham said he didn't want them to have a king you can go through explaining all the things and reading all the things that the king would make them do and all that but to sum it up in one little point god didn't want israel bowing before king now who would be wanting that to take place then if it wasn't god would not that be the devil's inroad of getting worship come on think on these things but there was no saving power in the law well brother dale you're just against the law no not if i can bring it around make it to ten commandments bring that down and put it into the seals i don't think i'd argue too much about that and that's been done so i don't worry about it but if there was no grace no saving power in the law why would anybody want it they already had grace they already had salvation you realize what they done they turned down salvation they turned down the grace of god to get something to do why is it that people don't want to hear grace preached on in the correct way they'd rather hear little do's and don'ts and you know beat you over there you know stomp your shoes a little bit they go home feeling good but just remember about two days later you're gonna feel bad again but if you get a revelation you can last a whole week whole year off just one revelation right but if there was no grace in the law and there was no saving power in the law why would man want it see there had to be another motive inside of them that would come on out eventually and show what mankind really wants they said about dathan and cora moses never argued with him he didn't say no you know no you ain't spiritual no he doesn't he said we're all spiritual he said you're going at it wrong see they didn't believe in a one-man message right and that's what israel couldn't stand that's what the pharisees couldn't stand it was a one-man message that's what the denomination's in the last days can't stand it's a one-man message we all just make too much of that man y'all call brother branham no paul said follow me as i follow christ well no problem well i'll follow christ ain't going to follow him will you know what you're saying i'm not going to follow paul now that's the point i wanted for us to think about within our own sales and see i wish i could go back into the parts of wednesday but it'd take too long but you just think exodus 19 it literally looks like because god said you are this you are this you're that you're this you're that you're this you're the royal priesthood you're chosen people you're this and as long as you do what's right everything is great and wonderful and you're on your way to the promised land and they said whatever god says for us to do will do but yet it turned out to be the most horrible mistake they ever made the golden calf was a problem god looked over those things remember if they'd sinned 10 times between the time of leaving egypt to cadiz barnea the bible even records ten times that they sinned against god and yet god says we're going to the promised land but yet when they got to the point they chose law he said yeah but the promised land and all this was way back over that's what i'm getting at there was a spirit coming down because 2 out of 12 was all that wanted to go in the promised land well three count moses see they had already begin to accept satan's lie right so then when it would come to the time of moses you know that god gave them the desire of their heart if you don't get nothing more out of get that point that's what i tried to end up wednesday just stopping and going on god will give you the desire of your heart the children of israel wanted meat right you remember that one and he gave it to him but while the meat was in their teeth it was plague struck but could we be in the same shape today no no we're believers in the message well as i ended the thought up saying and i have it written back in here to get to it again if we have time for don't do it this evening when the blind man was healed the people said they're going to argue they couldn't argue about the healing right right and they couldn't say the healing healing wasn't of god but what did they say to him he told him who it was you know to open his eyes you're his disciples we're moses disciples in other words we got moses and by taking it like that that is what killed them was by saying we're moses disciples that's that's horrible in it but there's no grace whatsoever there's no saving power in the law it was given as a policeman to put us in jail and that's trying to explain the other day and i know they don't need trying to explain because everybody's going to argue anyway but if you're going one mile over the speed limit the law has a right to put you in jail they might give you a little grace or whatever this is or that but they got a right to if you steal they got a right put you in jail and they can't do that to me i'm american citizen yeah they'll judge that see there's no grace in the law but jesus christ never come to do away with the law he come to magnify it make it honorable the scripture says because paul said the law is spiritual he said but i'm carnal now him are born again a christian why would he be talking about him being carnal don't you think he was a christian sure but think about it let's read a little bit go ahead with number one brother hear him 57 925 e31 what if we took the there's no flesh justified by the law moses represented the law the law has no salvation now you say well i don't believe what you're saying well then you're going to read what brother branham said let's see if you argue him of course the same spirit in you said i ain't going to agree what brother dale said if i say the truth it's going to you're going to say the same thing about what brother branham said then you're going to run over to some of these churches now that's proven he's wrong here and wrong there because that way you justify people's got to have something see by being a human being we've got to have something to hold on to even if it's proving everybody else wrong you know so the law is a policeman the law brings you under condemnation the law puts you in jail it has nothing to bring you out with it just jails you and tells you you're a sinner and guilty that's what elijah represented he represented the law all right go to the next one just get a few things read and then we'll get back to our point go to paradox now if some of these jumps up when we get on the wrong thing how do i remember my printer wasn't working at the house and i had to come here and get it all straightened back up and redone because i couldn't print nothing there this is a message called paradox 1965 16-17 they started out really with grace to begin with before they had the law they had grace while they were in egypt without law no one down there was just a priest and so forth but they didn't have any laws they didn't have that while they were in egypt they come on out they're saying a while ago but they were laying the thing was getting in order the law had not been given grace provided them a prophet and also grace provided an atonement a sacrificial lamb we're getting into that this week on the sacrifice the blood because there are lays your healings the atonement had been provided before there was any law grace was before law during the law and after the law joshua was dire to represent as we gave the other night grace but he could not read what the prophet said he could it couldn't be enforced joshua represented the grace but it couldn't be enforced while law was in existence may i say it this way if you and i think that we've done anything to save ourselves we're not saved by grace grace is you accepting a pardon that's all we got that we can do i'd like to get on down into that one but one of these days the prophet said this church is going to come to an ephesians again but we won't get to our go ahead do number 2a which you hear him program 31 57 725 what if we took the law there's no flesh justified by the law moses represented the law law has no salvation laws of policemen let's see is that the same quote yeah okay all right that's what i said i double quoted him okay we'll go on because i had all these laying on there go ahead to the next 2b go to b this is your hymn which is preaching 57 807. how would you try to keep the law no man is justified by the law no flesh can be saved by the law the law had no salvation the law was a prison house now see we want to say was that's not what i'm talking about if paul was talking about him with a carnality about him in life and talking about that the man is under the law as long as he liveth then we're still under the law of carnal commandments no i'm born again that's for the soul why did the prophet say we had the marriage in divorce situation misinterpreted theology all right the law was a prison house the law come and told you he was a sinner and put you in jail but had no power to bring you out so i won't i wouldn't want to be a prisoner and that's what the law does shuts you up condemns you says thou shalt not if you do it you're in prison there's no way of getting out so i wouldn't want the law but peter wanted to build a denomination and call it the law do you remember where peter was at on the mount of transfiguration let us build three tabernacles he wanted to build a denomination think on these things as we read them look at number 2c hebrews chapter 1 57 8 31. now the law was a type of the grace the law had no saving power in it law only was a the law was a policeman the policeman put you in jail but you see you're taking grace to get you out so the blood of jesus christ would have to come and set us free now i'm trying to get all of this lined up to word that i can preach on the invisible union and bring it forth of the new birth all right but it was a policeman he told you you was a sinner there's nothing else you could do okay going to number three let's see what your prophet had to say that's 2d going to number three try to bypass some of these things this is taking abraham's covenant 1961-317 e-17 abraham to come by faith abraham never received this promise while he was in circumcision under the law why is he saying that why did he talk about abraham which was way before law and yet he says under the law before he circumcised me rules regulations do's and don'ts things we think we do and think we don't uh i'll remind you i'll get to it later but i remind you as quick as they sinned in the garden they made them some fig leaves but god wouldn't take it all right abraham never received the problems while he was in circumcision under the law but when he was under grace before circumcision was ever issued therefore it's not nothing that we could do to merit it's god's grace that gives it to us by faith abraham believed god and it was imputed to him for righteousness the law is what man wanted not what god wanted okay law is what man wanted no god was going to give him the law show me where he was paul concludes it by saying the law was given because of transgressions is that scripture it was not god's will to give the law yeah but now you're talking about spiritual law now be careful brother because that law is spiritual i agree with you but why do you need law if you have the law giver in your presence right why do you want a book of rules if you got the one who wrote the book they had the prophets they had the sacrifices they had the grace it had to be some kind of a situation look at the next one that was back an early minister brother dale okay let's go in his later ministry let's go to does god ever change his mind about his word 1965 418 evening service paragraph 96 god permitted israel to take a law in exodus the 19th chapter when grace had already given them a prophet pill or fire sacrificial lamb a delivering power and they cried out for a law it wasn't god's will what's now but it was injected because man wanted it now read that next verse real careful and he was cursed by the very law did he want it see it's not god's will it was permitted going down reading down through there while i'm talking you'll find him explaining that god will take his permissive will and make it work out for his perfect will because what else could he do when they were out there saying give us something to do i keep emphasizing god i want you to read it because that bored on me for many years you read exodus 19. it doesn't even look similar to what brother branham is explaining it but we've got to believe what he says or else you the prophet let's believe you see that's what that spirit is trying to do it looks like there that they said god said you're this you're this you're this just make sure you don't mess up your okey dokey and they say everything god says to do will too looks very simple don't it but he said it was not god's will to give it to him and said the man was cursed by the very law that he wanted you know the good old baptist used to preach but there was no law until moses came and it wasn't there wasn't any law until moses came well ain't no condemnation where there ain't no law that's paul come on read it where there's no law there's no condemnation but you don't keep on reading where paul said but unto those see before the law they were judged by the he called it similitude of adam's transgression those that sinned before law was brought into being to keep a record was guilty of sin because of the similitude are the acts of adam the doings of adam you never heard people preach like that well they wouldn't know before there was any law there was no sin well i thought that's what he's done in the garden you know i thought that was the problem in heaven but you see there wasn't no record keeper the law is a record keeper that's what it's doing you go down to the law you do it break the law they make a record you get just a little ovidi i remember one brother come here you know he he didn't think too much about them old parking tickets he just you know ain't got time to fool going down there well one day they pulled him over going in front of the hospital and he wound up jail for about three months called the parking tickets he really thought he's smart with it i mean two bucks a parking ticket or something you know paid 30 all my i think it was 90 i went to see him while he's in jail i won't call his name but i've done everything trying to help him get it out and there just wasn't nothing you could do why because he had a whole bunch of parking things he wouldn't go pay him the law had a right to keep him there the law was just a record keeper see before the law came into being man was judged by the consciousness of the man and that's what we've always been judged by when the law came it didn't change that that's what i want you to see the children of israel wanted the law god knew they wanted law so he gave it to him man even though it looks like it was he just went down and gave it to him you mean you're telling me that brother dale that the law was a word of god but god wasn't intended to give it not that way not that way what do you mean by that i mean there already was grace standing there why would they not want it that way that's when i say it's hard to preach truth why wouldn't why would anybody i'm talking to you and me this is plain why would we want some kind of rules or regulations or something or why would we look down on everybody else you know that's the way you do come on you go around looking at people i see they're not lined up to the word right just remember one thing one scripture that's always built with me whatever condemnation i pass out will be meted back to me according to the scriptures well don't you believe in people dressing right no i believe in people getting born again any well-dressed right if they ain't dressed right they ain't born again is that simple how many people in your steals and lies and cheats and come on well no i'm a christian well i thought that's what the whole bible was to be but you see law was never to bend god's will if it'd walk right on down through there it'd come right straight to jesus christ but no god knew i'm keep emphasizing that point where you'll get it god knew what they wanted even better than their own wordings of what they wanted amen their wordings sound good we'll do what god says to do don't you think that's a good statement to make wouldn't that be a good pledge for anybody to make whatever god wants me to do i'll do it but if god knows your heart why you're saying that he knew they weren't going to keep no law well how do you know by his foreknowledge he could look down and see what they done the next day the day after you know really my definition of legalistic things is probably a funny one but you know we're all trying to justify ourselves in some way that's what gets people called is because you know it's hard to go out and kill somebody and just not tell nobody you keep your mouth shut you never would be able to solve the crime what do you do you go talk to somebody why because you just don't want to be by yourself and you don't go down before the judge and say judge i'd like to tell you a little secret i killed a man the other day no no you don't do that you'll pick a buddy someone close to you that kind of sympathizes with you because you want somebody to sympathize with you well you know and after a while they said well you know i gotta right kill that feller they've not done what they done i know i run that guy off the road but it was his problem being on the road see we can always justify and that's what we try to do but see who was that now the question is asked here who was that of israel that would won't may i illustrate it but donny's got an away model i guess he still got it but and it runs it's good and they're good to set up in the barn and look at but you don't want to go across country right i mean you just don't want to go across country with them they're good to look at they're good shiny fine little toys that's good but you know i'd probably pick a bicycle if i had to go from here to california i'd probably pick the bicycle over the a model but i figured i'd make it quicker that are going to be working on a lot well what are you talking about i'm talking about choices we make why would israel choose law instead of grace why would eve commit adultery with an animal it must have been some other outside influence motivating as i said in israel they chose law the next step was they chose a king the next step they chose satan you want to quote brother around them he said when they rejected jesus and freed barabbas said that put satan to his highest apex of his being exalted him need that quote you see the same one that caused eve the problem in the garden was the same one that was in the people wanting them to choose law it was the same one it was in the people that wanted them to choose a king the same one that was in the children of israel that chose to parabus to be freed and crucify jesus the same one that's wanting you and i to think that we got something to do in our salvation even your prophet you remember when he shot he said only thing i can say was that i didn't commit adultery you see you go talk to people and they're dying or something they'll they'll try to pin it onto something but i've never done that i never done the things that that them other people done but where does that make me of any value or a thought see they chose law instead of grace we're going to read a good bit in a minute on that in other words wouldn't it not be that they chose law thinking it was grace they thought that was god's will for their life to have a book of rules now as i said about the a model illustrating it see you got a prophet that can tell you all your problems and troubles to straighten everything out you got a sacrifice that was made for you you got an unconditional covenant the unconditional covenant came to abraham before the law ever came into being right i mean in the scripture it's genesis about 15 unconditional covenant you've got to get on over into exodus and things before you get to the law numbers what about having all of that and saying but we want something to do give us something to do what are we thinking about what we do and don't do well i ain't like that other person right i kind of remember the story behind that was it not two people praying and one of them said i haven't done this and done that and i haven't been like him yet the bible said the old sinner just wept and said father forgive me he said now who went home justified oh when that guy walked out of the building and wanted to pray for everyone but let's go and i prayed my prayer i prayed my prayer one and i went through my prayer and in my prayer i said i'm not like him and i thank god i'm not like him probably wound up in hell right right yet he sure didn't think he's going you know brother ryan said the one that's going to be the problem when you get to the white throne judgment is the preachers say have not i done this and have not i've done that happen to all this thing they said depart from me i never knew you listen to a few quotes let's read some all right go ahead with number five brother let's just read some of the things we bypass number four where they wanted the king and brother brown said when they accepted saul as their king they denied god as their king that's where where has thy strength gone samson 1959-702 they wanted a king and and when they accepted saul as their king they denied god as their king and when we accept denominational barriers and handshakes and classical things instead of the holy spirit then we're denying god our king okay now look the sumerian church age prison 1960 1206 trying to cut down i stood upon the bank and had a pentecostal meeting they did but listen moses sang in the spirit miriam took a tambourine and ran down the bank beating this time of rain and dancing in the spirit and the daughters of israel followed her dancing in the spirit if that ain't a pentecostal meeting i never seen one little did they believe that the the promised land was 40 years ahead of them it was only about 40 miles but it take them 40 years to get 40 miles is because they chose the wrong thing they chose to have a law instead of the letting of instead of letting the holy spirit lead them the filler pillar fire to take them on through and lead them they wanted to have something to do themselves they wanted to have certain priests and certain dignities and a little theology they could fuss about instead of just going on and letting the holy spirit lead them they were in the spirit god had provided everything but they had have something to do into it something to do what is it that we have something to do i've told you this and i try to do it as an illustration a lot of people jump up run into the message and say i've i know i got the holy ghost because i came in the message when i came in the message i saw immediately i did not have the baptism of the holy ghost yet i was a deacon in a baptist church at 23 years of age i was teaching adult sunday school classes when i left the church but yet when the prophet started talking about the baptism of the holy ghost and the person of jesus christ i knew i didn't have it and for two years i sought it reading praying everything i could do to try to find god you see that's the problem with people they don't understand why paul would say that he was the chiefest of sinners because he didn't do what people had done people that have done things can repent of what they do and they feel good about it but what about people that hadn't done things becomes a very religious society within yourself it's harder for a good man to be saved than it is for a bad one amen you may not believe that but that's all right look what they've done god has a provided way number six e62 i mean e-72 little did they know then when did they there was only about 10 days from the promised land knowing that they were 40 years away from it why because they refused to follow god they wanted a law instead of grace and they got it so they couldn't make their own way so that they could make their own way and have their own so and so man's always tried to do something by himself and god let every one of them perish in the wilderness and raised up a new generation and took them to the promised land what are we doing look at number seven return in jubilee i'll try to scan through this because this is a long reading we're going from paragraph e46 to 50 i guess and little did they know raise this one up brother they were dancing in this dancing on the banks of the jordan there on the dead sea that they were 40 years away from the land little did they know there was only about five days away and they made their rash ratio mistake in exodus the 19th chapter where they accepted law instead of grace where they turned down god's way to have a way for themselves give us something to do that's been man's idea all along well that's not my idea first with the prophet now remember it's been man's ideal that's the nature of man what save yourself adam expressed that in the garden of eden when he was lost instead of going back to god for grace he tried to make himself an apron and ever since then he's tried to have something to do with redemption when redemption is a free offer of the of grace by god god alone there's nothing you can do to save yourself god saves you no way at all you can do but man wants something to do into it man wants something to do to save yourself i've always said if it was told to go stand on your head and pay a ten thousand dollar fine you'd become a christian the churches would be slapped full that day might not be out of the end but that day they'd be there to make sure they go through that ritual because that's what churches do right a good old brother he's a member in good standing i'm not throwing off on him just making a point the preacher preached it my brother-in-law was raising tomatoes up in heaven because god needed somebody to raise tomatoes and he was good at it you know well i hope he's there i wouldn't tell nobody if they're lost and not going that's not the right thing to do either i've had to preach funerals that i didn't know about people you know what i preach about like brother branham said he said preach to the people right you notice i'm not too straight about what's going on i preach to the people if i understand somebody i'll try to do the best i can but he said mankind today don't want the leadership or the church don't that god has provided they try to think of some other way they go to seminaries educate their men come out with a theological experience that's off that same message paragraph 50 on it e50 yes sir they made a rational mistake when they did that they wondered for 40 years that's exactly what they'd done they wondered for 40 years when there wasn't over five days from the promised land it's about 40 miles from the red city where they went they could have walked in three or four days and been in the promised land but they made their own choice now you understand what i'm trying to get out you may not read revel exodus 19 and see it clearly but read it and see it clearly of this god knew what they wanted and he gave it to him he knew what they wanted in their heart god the prophet said god will give you the desire of your heart they chose law grace had furnished them a lamb i'm just going on down to skin and so moses was a prophet grace provided everything they had need of but they wanted something to do themselves wanted something to do themselves that's exactly what pentecost did when god revealed some new thing something in the scripture instead they call it new issues or whatever they want to do about it but when god revealed something instead of accepting truth and test it with the bible this is from the message oh lord just once more verses 63 6 28. instead of accepting the truth and test it in the with the bible they pulled out and made an organization separated himself and then along come this and the other and now you stand you won't be correct you're corrupted go to number nine this is a message paradox 1965. if you'll notice then their journey in the wilderness is where they're got their greatest mistake that israel ever made until calvary was when in exodus 19 they accepted the law instead of grace they had grace they had a prophet they had a sacrificial lamb they had redemption they had been brought through the red sea they had been healed of their diseases they had water from a smitten rock they had manna out of heaven everything had they had need of had been supplied and still they wanted something else they wanted to be like the rest of them how much more do we need he said well brother dale don't you want us to do anything a paradox paragraph 71 now that's where people think today of divine healing or something any other work of grace that there is something that you have to do you there is nothing you have to do but believe just believe god then the next one what did he say you do have something to do on down in the message a little into it that's your surrender of your own will to the will and idea of almighty god that's finished take his promise don't think nothing about it just keep moving trying to get down to the last one number 11 let's get it oh excuse me let's go on to number 10 on the paradox paragraph 76. there you go they wanted the law and all god always gives you the desire of your heart he promised to but we find out when they turn one step from the side of what god had reasonably promised then that was a thorn in the flesh until the law was taken away until jesus christ came and was crucified always gives you the desire of your heart so if you want a book of rules he'll give it to you look at the lies when hear him preach in 1962 7-11 number number 11. let's see see they made their mistake i'm having to find where it's at so i got 79 rolled it up all right yep right in here okay but you see where they made their rational mistake was exodus 19 when they got away from grace that god had already provided for them and got them a prophet and a pillar of fire and a sacrificial lamb and doing signs and wonders grace had provided that but they wanted something to do themselves they had to have something to make themselves doctors of divinity so they wanted a law and theirs where they died no that was the last statement i wanted to get to the prophet said there's where they died when they wanted law you know brother dale we're not wanting to be under law why do we judge everybody else by our own book of rules like always gets me as a lot you know that people will say i don't understand how come brothers sisters so-and-so didn't see it i saw it immediately and i'm the pastor that's been around here all these years know that it took me four or five years to get some of you even thinking correct on those things but yet you saw it immediately sister gayle's one on the one in the building secondary and said i didn't you see church we can have a book of rules and call it grace my point what they chose law instead of grace they chose law thinking that was god's will for their lives yet the prophet said it was not god's will to give the law then we'll get to it this evening what is the law given for then as a schoolmaster it's got its reason see god turned around and took it they chose it god gave it but he gave them himself in a letter form what do we got i believe the message brother dale i believe everything the prophet said amen i remember and we'll get to him this evening and somebody man seemed like during the bible said one time said have you received the gift of the holy ghost since you believe that's what i say to you and i how we receive the holy ghost since we believe well i come in the message that's reading i know i'm born again what is your evidence what is your evidence of the holy ghost whether you want to believe it or not we all have it and that's the point of driving down hard to get us to see because we can't get if we can't get this driven down hard enough to see then we'll never know what in the world a new birth is because a new birth to most people is just live in a book of rules right leaving a book of rooms but what is the new birth you realize what i'm talking about if they'd kept right on walking and not accepted law one one time he said five days by the time he said ten days that's just a man talking right that's not mistakes ten days or something they would have been in the promised land you realize how quickly they struck that promised land if they could have believed it jesus christ would have come on the scene because it was lost they needed a savior but if they had just accepted it went on he'd have met him right there in the promised land of course you and i wouldn't been involved in all this you know what i'm glad they did i'm glad they went the way they went from you and i oh we wouldn't be here but now what are we going to do with come on brothers what are we going to do with it what they wanted that's the question or the thought that i put out today they got what they wanted and it killed them they died but they died believing is right when are we going to get to the point to where that we will accept what god has to say unto us and accept it as grace i've heard sermons preached that a prophet is law that's right he is but then why don't they preach that he's grace too amen he's grace why did they need a king to lead them they're going to start bowing down before him that's what satan wanted if you understand what i've tried to drive you especially wednesday night and this morning that there is a reason why israel chose law it was the devil in them that they thought it was god in them it's not the devil didn't bring the law you don't you misunderstand me devil caused them to want it by doing that it proved it and they died it cursed them the very thing that they thought was deliverance was cursed them paul said what i thought was life i found to be death but you know it's so hard to get away with brother you're just not leaving anything that we can depend upon to say i'm saved because i didn't do or done it it didn't it did what you know what do we need a reason or thing we're not believing god let's stand well not believe what he says there is no grace outside of believing god's word there is no salvation in the book of rules you can't make yourself good enough to be saved if you could jesus christ died in vain come on folks so let's accept what he done for us okay what are we covering 6 12 anybody have a need don't want to ask the lord you are me and you are my brother even though lord jesus our little sister she wants us to pray for her family lord what a great thing you just keep that desire in your heart lord and then you move on to sin and you just manifest yourself through the family and let her look sister see that desire that she has to see you moving in their lives we believe you father because she believes you and we thank you in jesus name anybody else so let's believe believe in a god that can take care of all things father in the name of jesus christ we send this prayer cloth for this one lord our brother's got to concern his heart for her now you come and you
