========================================

okay fine all right last time let's turn back to Genesis for this is what we're really early still you know I love this no you're not listening to my services of the Bears are you sure why I ought to be quiet yeah this is for over 15 year we're reading from and we've been studying on this and the Lord said unto Him therefore news for every slave King vision shall be taking on him Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him so we've been looking at the mark and what the Sevenfold punishment means it compares a Sevenfold punishment to down through the Old Testament how God executed a law and justice and then we're bringing it all up to the time of Christ so last time I was just going through the history the violence of the Old Testament how after the flood god instituted civil justice and then after visualize rejected grace in Exodus 19 then God put in gave them a law that if you um if you break the law then you're guilty of the punishment is capital punishment and and then bring it all up let's see where we stopped so last time I kind of review some of the reasons why capital punishment would be implemented against you some of the crimes again let me just run through so that again just just to the background sacrificing any God other than Jehovah passing children to the fire to my life pushing available false prophecy necromancy blasphemy Sabbath breeding savagely breaking an outsider who gets too close to the tabernacle because the the Levites will position between the inner court and the and the outer coordinator court to keep an unbeliever from entering in to the torture sexual immorality adultery married your wife and mother prostitution homosexuality vaishali and murder smiting a parent cursing appearing disobedient children 54 child's disobedient and the parents were supposed to stone them kidnapping enables your home side for example if you if you didn't have your ox pinned up and it killed someone that you were guilty and she could be condemned to death contempt of course fault witness to a capital crime and see all these things under the law the Justice had to be applied and there was no to think about this when we get into it under grace about how nowadays you've got prison ministries and things that we're because grace is applied grace allows people that have committed murders all of these things we're reading through gives them an opportunity to accept grace coming to the blood so Alyssa the next the next thing is we're just going through the history of violence in the Old Testament and coming up to grace let's look at numbers 35 now I'm kind of doing a little highly water because we're all familiar with a lot of these topics this is the cities of refuge that the bleach verse 6 and 7 and among the cities which he shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge which he lost his shop point for the Mansa langer that he may flee thither until then you shall have forty and two cities so all the cities we shall give to the Levites shall be 40 MHC me to them show you give with their suburbs so what happens if someone unintentionally murdered someone then they could flee to the city and then be judged because every everyone has to stand before the judgment and then if you were found to not intentionally have murdered someone then you can take refuge in the city which is a type of taking refuge in Christ and you would you would have to stay in that city until unless you want to risk your life of being killed by the one of the Avengers a lot of family members for example of the person that you accidentally killed and you stay in that city until the high priest died and the you know Jesus is a high priest of our confession when he died were set free Oh vengeance we were talking last time about vengeance with Cain how God always through the Old Testament he opposed own vengeance let's look at Leviticus 19 see how much deal even though justice has been implemented in the law you still can't take these listen to someone Thanks Leviticus 19 18 chapter 19 verse 18 let's just let's start at verse 17 thou shalt not hate thy brother in the heart thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon verse 18 thou shalt not Abby engine or very any grudge against the children's I can so thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord and it's interesting how they Old Testament and I'm gonna talk about this in a second how the Old Testament bills because they be the profits from building the body of Christ the body of the church by establishing the word that build upon it one thing builds upon another and a whole everything just builds precept upon precept but even in the Old Testament you can see how vengeance is the law of God that that Jesus preached about he was on earth was already being established in the Old Testament and even though law and justice is in play it's still not right to take vengeance on some 10 proverbs 24 29 to 30 proverbs 24 first 29 mr. Street verse 29 see not I will do so for him as he have done to me young will render to the man according to his work now we know that this is going to be a very quick heavy less because I have a lot of quotes that Roberto said we know that a Elijah you know even when the 50 came let's go ahead and read escort the second king is first one Moses represented along Elijah represented justice second Kings chapter 1 verse 9 to 13 this is the story of how they are the armies were sent to bring Elijah and God through well I just smoked the fifties he said three in the third was was favored because they're offended then the king sent under him a captain of 50 with his 50 and he went up to him and behold he said on the top of a hill and he spake unto him thou a man of God the king of said come down when Elijah answered and said to the captain or 50 if I be a man of God then let fire come down from heaven to consume the end I 50 and there came down fire from heaven consumed him in this 50 again also he sent unto him another capital of 50 with his 50 any answer who said on here momentum god that's not the king said come down quickly and a large answer to Senator than five be man oh God let fire come down from heaven and consume D&I 50 and the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him of his beauty and he sent again a captain of the third 50 with his 50 and the third capita 50 went up and came and fell on his knees before lives and assaulted 27 to him oh man oh god I preview let my life and the life of these 50 die surface tension be precious in that site and then my straightener then we come up to what Ramos's in a life and and Jesus were all on my formal the Mount of Transfiguration and brother Brendan said they left represented law justice in grace when Jesus came Gracie it's to degrade slowly see buddies in the absolute you said the very God that could take a little nosed you like all angry and going down there to put all the Christians to death under capital punishment will change him and making my lovely chrétien that same tires tonight can change law to grace any time that he takes a nation to do it now um the Old Testament story we talked about which one we just went over was a dispensation of period work otters were revealing himself in a different way than he is now or relating himself to me in a different way and just to talk about dispensationalism a little bit dispensational your non dispensationalist you started the New Testament and you look at the new testament to see what the Old Testament see it but dispensational has started the Old Testament beginning to the hand and everything builds on these on until the precept upon precept so you start from Cain and you kind of you begin to understand God's motives and objectives and his character you look at the Old Testament see how the the law on that justice is a tight a natural type of in a new testament of spiritual so in the Old Testament they would take a sword up and kill run somebody through if they if they broke a law in the New Testament it's a new testament is spiritual death there's some spiritual death on the Old Testament spiritual death on New Testament to but in an act in the Old Testament we have a natural example that we can learn from and that's what dispensationalism is going from the building up on each other through this scripture and I I many people say it's not really a good idea to read the Bible from cover occur but I think at least once in your life you should start the beginning and read through because they're to just see it helps to learn how everything builds on each other Oh another another thing that dispensationalism has in common with what we believe is that the seishin ilysm it has a literal interpretation of Scripture if when you read about the literal curses that are spoken of Israel you can also trust that the blessings that are given to Israel are going to be given to them one we believe that Noah literally was in our that the things that happened in the wilderness literally happened to the children vision so i was telling brother Wade last time that I hope that last last time I kind of was talking about the Old Testament law and justice and I hope I didn't give me the impression that in the New Testament that we still have capital punishment and we'll get in what brother branham's said in a second because the the crux of the matter is what are we interested in are we interested in death or life and now we're interested in life nincada smyrna brother and said now the Old Testament and all of his characters and characteristics was only a foreshadow of the wage of the Keystone a new testament that joins law and this dispensation to healing many people has referred to this as the Christian dispensation but it isn't this is the Holy Spirit dispensation the Christian dispensation lasted three years of six months the law lasted for several hundred years and then the Christian dispensation was what Brie's dorky stoned and you an old testament together now at the New Testament just to explain what the New Testament is the New Covenant is the New Testament in his blood the life that was in his blood coming back on you and living in that's what the new testimony here you heal he said what did Elijah represent the Justice of God who wants justice brother I don't want mercy not justice we're all born in seeing safe genetically and then come to the world speaking lies we are guilty from the beginning to the end there's not one of us can redeem one another if we're Archbishop's hoops whatever we might be your profits or whatever even if we were angels we would still be unfit to redeem one another certainly I don't want justice never do I call for justice I want mercy God give me your mercy now when we think about what Jesus let me explain what desus did on the cross a lot of people I remember years ago we met this little sister that being worn to a message church for her whole life and she she meant comment that she had just seen what Jesus did on the cross and I'm just to give an example with if let's say if I was a judge and someone came up to me or someone was being tried then as a human judge I might just take the what they had done in the list of their sins and just kind of throw it in the trash can and saying well because of my my human compassion to you I'm going to take what you've done and just throw it away and according to our human laws that might work that might everything might be all right but God is a God justice and that's not just because if you even if you throw it away that your sins are still in the landfill or whatever the mark of the the record of what you've done is still there when he came all across what he did was he a man he took everything that we did yep I'm sorry okay take it upon himself so there's no record do you more the message look he said he was talking about i said well i was calling the case the other day you know he's over here in Texas I got a little certificate from him the other day saving a life and said we went over there for that little acres that may not taken a picture of the angel of the Lord in that night over there Houston they criticize me and said everything in the world about me threw his arms around me hug me said just think brother Brennan the very man that I said was practicing hypnosis has come to save my son from the electric chair that's right I talk there before them all on what did the governor do pardon oh my oh and it was to die in 45 days after was right while interested in life life I said sir you have no right to take the boy's life the first blood was ever spilled one brothers build another he shed his blood I didn't take his life in capital punishment he put a mark upon him that nobody would kill him don't rub that off a man named me and right we're interested in life now I need to make this point if you look at what all of the other denominations believe all the other theologians if you look at what aw pink candy Toby bullinger and all the famous writers say everybody says the capital punishment is still in effect but brother branham differs then he's the only one if I did a lot of reading on what people think and you can't find anybody that could tie like together like brother n appear in your tail 60 he said they killed him because he made himself God he was godly hung him because he died on her capital punishment that's the reason I don't believe in capital punishment Jesus died under the punishment of capital punishment from the government of crying because God willing we'll take capital punishment as a nation and he'll use it against God's people like he's doing brother Yusuf over there and Irene we keep it in your prayer and you can see how God's fighting a battle for him all the nations of the world are coming together brother you said who should have been dead already Irena anything to do with it is your life really other gospel he said I don't believe in taking the people's life he said if you'll notice on your criminal records records who is it that gets cute little electric chairs and things it's not the rich you can afford to get him a lawyer and some pool some dirty tricks and some wheels here and some over here and drive the thing he said its own kids like that they found enough money to buy them a decent meal that's the kind of gifts there's the kind of the electrocute somebody that's like they call a bunch of ignorant when they just hold up their lane or capital punishment I said the first murder was ever committed in the world one brother kill another and God and not taking his life for it he put a marker woman that nobody she take he's a lot right that's the supreme judge i see they took the sent us off with him now they're going to get another truck or still get life now somebody 11 years or maybe stand for all their guilty certainly they're guilty he's not saying they're not guilty they're guilty but they shouldn't get get the death penalty they ought to be set to penitentiary for a lifetime but not their life taken ooh no man has a right to take another man's life no sir I don't believe in at No Andy because we're back just like in the original justice was in God's hands now it's back in his hands again in the bride and uh we stopped a second reef let's look at my ng5 let's start at verse 17 think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I'm not come to destroy but to fulfill and I I don't know about you but sometimes I kind of Miss quote this in my head as I'm not going to destroy but to magnify but here he says I'm come to fulfill to what I was talking about he took everything although all of the sin in our lives on himself and fulfilled it once because he died now we can live because he took all all of the accusations against us and took it upon himself and so where does it say he's going to magnify the law because we know it says that I said Isaiah and don't don't turn their less Isaiah 42 the Lord is well pleased for his righteous to say people magnify the law and make it honorable and then he proceeds to make a follow all this it makes it greater makes it i'm fairly i say to you till heaven earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments I shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall teaching you and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of doing for I saying the unit except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven he of heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill whosoever shall kill shall be amazed the judgment now is magnifying the hall from the old times somebody put witness you killing somebody and say well this person struck them with a sword smote them down but now how are you going to tell if somebody has violated the law but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment Zeus whoever shall say to his brother raca which is kind of like it was a it means um it was expression that you back then to call somebody stupid or say there's there's another AP here that's what it really means it in TN that person is empty-headed shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say that fool and in Psalms David said the fool say that a corner is no God what this really means is a rebel now fool that were biggest person is repelling is God shall be in danger of Hell fire so don't don't call your brother tell your brother sister say they're not a believer accused you accuse somebody not be a Christian in bed with your heart this but my point is in the Old Testament it was apparent to everyone if somebody committed a crime and now it'll always magnified the Holy Spirit has to accuse you in your heart it's not uh it's between you and God there's no way for me to say well brother Danny oh you know doesn't like me or so let's let's take him out and give it a capital punishment and I years a few years ago but I think the thought Harris was telling me about another mr. Church that if you disagree with what I teach them the Deaconess will take you outside and give you a big what there so there are some people that kind of take the capital punishment thing a little bit literally oh that's a yes physically oh the best most is that justice no sir no justice I thought very bad about it when I looked over in the Bible and seeing that every man that ever have a spiritual office in the Bible was connected with the government the government God can call this the seat of the devil think back Moses dear Ryan Daniel all the toughest even Jesus Christ died under capital punishment by the government they can't catch them in morals and anything else of the devil is amazed he throws it all the government that's exactly right yeah and I don't have any political motive for discussion capital punishment because I I'm the last person you want to ask about political opinions but no we're just talking about the Bible here Christ has revealed in his own word brother Brown said so was the priest releases to the core some religious 21 misconstrued they be stoned to death the death penalty of fooling with the word of God was dead that's what's the matter with our country today the really got so many loose leaf things in the earth today the penalties are not strong enough if a man was caught running out with another man's wife they should be both be taken out and put it in cash trader right public and turn loose that's right a man is caught him doing anything wrong down the road speeding he ought to be given less than 10 years he's premeditated murder I strongly and premeditated murder if you call speed to see you put penalties like that on it you'll slow them down but when some crooked politician can get to this one over here passing off and say well he was a drinking little he was getting me to do that kill a man wife and a whole bunch of innocent children letting Ricky get by with it max politics that's the word or less than devil now that Christ is revealing his own words and God said if a man was caught in adultery or a woman take them out there and stone him to death that settled it see if he's even caught picking up a weight of stick on the South they take him and stony you know that used today they even have prohibition on the side on their saddle too they won't even push the elevator button or anything because if you push that low belly button you're doing you're doing work babe they live complete divided along they said they lived it by then and now see we don't have them kind of laws today but the Christian the church what I'm talking to this morning that law of God is in your heart see you have no desire to do it it's inside here you want to keep God's law so perfect no matter what it is you want to be just what if God needs a doorman at the door he wants you to be that door mat you're so happy to be there no matter what it would be you won't be the doormat see whatever God wants you to do that's what you want to do because it's God the law of God is in your heart Christ as a mixture of God our ability said Christ have mercy the law puts you in jail but couldn't get you out the Prophet says God's just to continue and kill you for that's right but Jesus was God to love in revelation to let note refer destined to see that he had ecology their blasphemous names like from his name z said motors representing the law the prophets represented his justice we could not live by the law we cannot live by his justice I don't ask just to someone mercy not justice I can't keep his law when I can't keep his me to justice but I need his mercy and God said the law and justice has been met in him he's my beloved son him that's him that's the one so we won't be in Christ but for those that are even not in Christ you still want to give them life you want to give them a chance to repeat because of that I I was just thinking about when I was studying on this all the all the people that all the prison ministries and different things that I I heard a years ago about this brother over in Africa that had killed I forget how many different people than he heard about the message and be called God's grace he's now one of the he's an apostle I know they're taking the word to jungles and things even though in this in his life he had you know that against his record killed six or seven different me and was into witchcraft and all kinds of different things but never to God's grace and saved it what about the prophets what about Elijah and what did he mean he was just a super presented God's justice a no man can be just outside of Christ Elijah had a commandment from God he went to the top of the mountain and while he was up there the king said let's go up and get that old crank at all go up and get him and he sent 50 min and that will profit stood a little old ski body and whiskers hanging down like a fuzzy were me he said if I be a man of God that fire fall from heaven and consume me that's justice that's what you deserve I don't want what I deserve I don't want just to say don't want judgment I want mercy God gave me mercy and others of all I'm not a denomination not as bishops I wanted to love and His mercy that's what the world is hungry for today is his loving his mercy God's mercy upon us I couldn't stand as with all I can't keep his law and he knows i don't want his justice he would condemn me but I'll accepted mercy and what can Jesus do for you you can save you can heal you you can give you a Salvation it can take you to go or you can cover your sins you can make your love one another you can make the method that shake hands with the Baptist and the Baptist and the presbytery of their arms around penticoff maybe brush stuff few more minutes and the message look brother Brennan said one day a mother boy acutely and he was laying there ready to die and so the little mother stood by the governor's go when they asked him and finally with one of the guard said governor that boys I he wants you she wants to see you and when they open the door and said madam he will receive you that little the poor little thing crawled on her hands and knees after speed ladies hands her hands upon his feet and said governor honorable sir said you're the only man it slip they can spare my son please counselor I know he's guilty he's just as guilty your course of justice founding guilty and how many of us are not guilty in the courts of God your course of justice found him guilty he actually killed and he's subject to death I knew that but sure is a man you have no right to take the life of my boy god only can give life and only God can take life so just to finish God's given us mercy in this dispensation and if you turn that down you you're going to go to spiritual take own spiritual death it's my little horrible thing burn down such grace God is we you can see how God's go from a dispensation of law and justice which is what we deserve and I can give us grace and we should do everything you can to accept it and give our lives to it alright amen thank you
