========================================

God bless you Saints good to be in the house of the Lord this morning did you woke up this morning feeling fine like the song says with Jesus on your mind we're studying through the book of Hebrews and the in our little Sunday school class let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we before we Dive In Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord and we pray Lord as we dive into these scriptures and unpack these things Lord that Paul spoke about that you'll open our understanding to them Lord bless brother Samuel and brother uh brother Lise Lord as they're preparing Lord God to minister this morning and uh and you'll just help us Lord to come in great expectation that that we'll receive what we have need of this morning Grant it Lord in your name amen so uh Hebrews chapter 8 uh Paul's uh we we we got to about verse 13 where Paul's he he's speaking of the New Covenant and and uh last time we kind of left off um kind of comparing the Old Testament and the New Testament where you could say um the Old Testament is uh was fulfilled in Jesus Christ there on the cross where he he just kind of like wound everything up in in his act on the cross as he died and gave his life for us on the cross there and in the New Testament he puts his life in us and he actually fulfills fulfills the essence of the law in us and so you you put those two pictures together of the of the of the of the bride and the bridegroom together and it's got a picture of love and you know you you you think about what the New Covenant is the real what what the whole story is it's it's a love story of God coming down and and to redeem his his bride and and and and she's not she's not uh forced into it at a C csed into it we were um we actually went to a wedding on Friday my my niece got married um we went over to to Birmingham and got to see that got a a little good a little time with with with family and and you know you when you watch a wedding it's that the the whole story of that wedding everything that's taking place it's not because somebody's the the bridegroom is is forcing her to to obey him or anything like that and you see when you when you you want to get the real picture of what the New Covenant is it's it's a picture of love you're not you're you're not you're not coming to church because you're forced to do it it's because you love God you don't pray because you're forced to do it it's because you love God when you get into a fix where you you want to fast you're not doing it because you're forced to do it because you love God you don't read your Bible because you're forced to do it because it's a love relationship so the whole thing is love we're not we're not we weren't forced to marry Christ but but it's because we love him and we recognize what he did for us on the cross cross that he died for us and gave his life for us and now that Agy love that was in him is now put in us now that's real love love you know the Greek has a lot of different ways to say love they've got filio love and and sto love which is like parental love and AOS which is which really not even love but Agape Love Is the Love of God where you love somebody that don't even love you back you love somebody that spits in your face the love that the love that God gives you the power to be able to forgive somebody and to to love unconditionally so you see that the and the new the New Covenant is fulfilled by love that the that the love that you have for one for another fulfills the law is what Paul said in Romans chapter 133 oh no man anything but to love one another that's what we owe one another is to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law so that you can see that all all the things that the old test spoke about in type can be wrapped up and summed up in in a goppy love in the life of a Believer being fulfilled in in your life walking on your feet being used God using your hands and using your eyes and using your lips to show love to the world it's love when a minister studies all night to bring a message to people it's love when you come to church and and give yourself even when you don't feel good when you have a headache it's love when you when you give to God Galatians chapter 5 says for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and James chapter 2 said if you if you if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well and first John said hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for their Brethren but who so hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in word neither in Tong but indeed and Truth what what are the these scriptures are laying down something for us to understand that when you get the new birth there's a change in your life it's not sufficient just for you to say well I've been educated in the in the message and in the gospel and I I understand that Christ died on the cross but when you receive God the way that he wants you to and the new and you've been born again it is going to change your life it'll change your thinking it'll change the way that you approach one another it'll change the way that you approach God because now you're not doing it because you're just looking at a rule book but now the love of God is manifested in you 1 John chap 5 says who whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat if you love Jesus you're going to love those that are born of him loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments oh we got to we got to live live live the word for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous it's not Grievous for us to dress right and to do right it's not Grievous for us to to not drink alcohol and to not smoke and and things because because something's changed in our heart and the desire for that has changed that the conscience of those things has been taken away and so those things are not Grievous for us anymore because the life of God is living in us and we're not living by a rule book of things that we go down a list of things that we've got to do but but we're living by the the a law of love that God is in us and he's living in us to change the the way that we do and the way we think and everything about us and the BR serpent brother R said God has a law and that law is love God can't work against himself then if I love God correctly then I'm going to testify the truth about God if I'm in love with him I've got a wife's here in this building God knows how I love her well you know everything good and everything is going to be for my wife you know that sure just like your husband would be to you well now if we love God then my confidence becomes perfect in him as I love him now he can't break that law of Love see because it's in my heart when you love God and then you know he loves you then you can really come to boldly to the throne of grace when you've got something going on in your life you can come because it's it's not something where you you feel like you're being beat over the head constantly but you're in love with Christ a love relationship so so now we see coming into coming into reality the true definition of what legal legalism is legalism is when your heart's not in it legalism is when you got a just a list that you're trying to and I I know I did it again I the font's too small y'all just bear with me legalism is the conviction just some notes Here legalis legalism is the conviction that lawke keeping is now after the fall the ground of our acceptance with God that you got to do you got to follow a list you got a list but your your heart's not in it how if somebody would say how can I how can I get to God how can I get God to be for me and not against me now the legalist answer is going to keep is going to say I got to keep the law I got to perform a list of rules I got to do I got this list list of things that I have to achieve but Paul said in Romans chapter 3 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law legalism legalism is a failure to be uh and this is just an example of something I I found online humbled broken amazed and satisfied by the grace of God in Christ again your what is it your heart's not in it legalism what happens when you're a legalist you start comparing yourself to other people and saying like that Pharisee that Jesus gave the example of in Luke chapter 18 that stood there praying and he said I I thank you that L thank you Lord that I'm not like this this person here that he thought was beneath him and yet that man whose heart was in it saying God I I I know I'm wrong I failed you that man had his prayer answered and Jesus said the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican see he was he was living by the rule book he wasn't an extortioner he wasn't unjust he wasn't in adultery he was living by all these rules but yet he was he his his heart wasn't in it I fast twice in the week I give ties of all that I possess and the publicans standing AAR off would not lift up so much as his eyes Under to heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exal exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exhausted so what's what's the difference that old the Old Testament was you look at it as it's an outward list of things that you're trying to achieve you know even today the Jews over there in Israel they they they'll hire a gentile to go perform labor for them on Sunday they'll hire that when they get in an elevator the elevators that you don't push a button you wait for it to come to your floor because they got it programmed so that you don't even they're they're they're so abiding by this list of rules that they don't put they don't they won't push an elevator on the Sabbath because they'll wait for it to get around to their floor and none of the buttons work on the Sabbath you see they look at it as an outward list of all these rules that they've got to achieve but you put that list of the law the tables of stone that's why that's why brother R said that those tables of stone that Moses came down from the mountain with are the Seven Seals cuz you put that into the heart of the believer and now you've got Christ revealed in Simplicity where nothing can be simpler than God revealing himself into in in in in your flesh that's that's the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament what's the difference legalism is a hard problem so when you you know we're preachers are preaching to get people not to obey a set of rules but we're preaching the gospel to convert your heart to convict your heart to change your heart to for you to realize that there's something lacking in you so that you're not doing it to just to just so that you don't get preached at but because you love God we want to come to church because we love God not just because we love the preacher or love love uh it's it's about a relationship with God and Jesus said in John chapter 14 or John he said if you love me keep my Commandments in chapter in Luke chapter 6 and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say people can call Jesus Lord and but yet their heart's not in it do they do they do you really love God in second John he said whosoever transgresses transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he has both the father and the son in Matthew Chapter 5 he said for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall no case enter to the kingdom of heaven how how is your righteousness going to exceed the righteousness of somebody that keeps the law to the letter so much that you can take a scroll and and they could tell you if they like brother Dale used to give that example stick a pen right through the scroll and they could tell you every letter it poke through how the only way that you can exceed that kind of righteousness is the righteousness of God is applied to you and his life is actually lived out in you in Galatians chapter 5 it says this I say then walk walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh cuz if you walk in the spirit it's going to take control over your life what's the point I'm trying to make this morning is that when you get born again there's going to be a change in your life you're not going to be the same person that you were you're going to be different in First Peter chapter chapter one he said but as he which hath called you is Holy so ye be holy in all manner of conversation there's your scripture against curing and profanity and things and having a whole not telling dirty jokes because if God's life is in you then your your whole makeup is going to change your speech is going to change you're not going to be telling dirty jokes and and cussing and stuff in Romans chapter 12 he says and be be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that me you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God in Colossians chapter 2 he says as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him he that hath my Commandments John said and keepeth them for he he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him how do you know you love God if you love God so much that you're willing to do what he says that it's not a grievous thing to you to to do just do what he says because you love God you're not doing it because you've been cracked upside the head by preachers but because a you're in a love relationship with Christ and Matthew chap 23 he said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tith of mint and Anis and cumin you done all these things that you think the law requires but is your heart in it and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone and 1 John chapter 5 says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous so now you got a story that's unfolding here uh a wedding story where the old testony is fulfilled in Christ and then Christ puts that same life in you and brother random gave the example so many times that if you take if you took John Dillinger and put his Spirit into you then you would act like John Dillinger all of a sudden you'd be a you'd be a gun shooter you'd know how to shoot and how to behave in a western town you take the spirit of Jesus Christ and put it into a Believer and they're going to act like Jesus Christ that's why he said these signs shall follow them that believe they'll cast out devils in my name and and all those other things all these promises because the Life of Christ is in you fulfilling himself fulfilling what the fulfilling what was spoken of in the New Testament so Paul in chapter nine he says then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary where there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's raw that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubims of Glory overshadowing The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the Holy Ghost this signify that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the s Service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time time of reformation now what's Paul saying here he's saying all of these things in the Old Testament that we could look at the the the the Pod of mana and the and the and the Ark and all the things of the the all the architecture of the of the Tabernacle and how everything was constructed all of it speaking of the Holy Ghost that was was to come all of those are type Old Testament types of what we have access to now in Christ and what does the Holy Ghost do it makes your conscience perfect makes your what's your conscience your conscience is that thing on the inside of you that tells you that you're not wrong you're not right that that that conscious is that thing that makes you toss and turn in the middle of the night when you begin to worry about where you're going to go when you die you begin to think that you're not right but there's something the Holy Ghost can make your conscience perfect to where you're not worried anymore where you know that when you die you're going somewhere that God is going to you've been saved and that that voice is now speak where it used to speak speak condemnation now it speaks confidence to you now I've got this The Voice the um the definition of conscience that I pull off the internet it says an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the rightness or wrongness of one's behavior and everybody's got that that voice on the inside that tells you if you're right or wrong everybody's got that little voice now Disney would twist that around and make it like a little Cricket speaking to you but you've got a voice it's not a cricket it's a gift from God to tell you whether you're right or wrong or not brother BR said in the guide he said oh you you trying to say oh I'm saved I go to church don't you worry you wait till that deathbed comes and you'll know it's different your conscience tells you something inside of you tells you you're wrong see you know if you die you couldn't meet a holy God as we've seen him last night even the Holy Angels have to bail their face to stand before him how are you going to stand outside the the blood of Jesus Christ to Veil you now that's what Paul is trying to say here that those were a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience but now we've got something that can make your conscience perfect that can that can speak back when you read the Bible and identifies you with what you're reading that gives you confidence that God has saved you Paul would go on to say he said but Christ being coming in high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into one entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for us and that's where our confidence is placed in what he did for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Purge your conscience your thinking Purge your conscience from dead work what's dead Works dead works is like where Jesus said that you're you're like whitewashed tombs that on the inside is Bones you're you're coming to church and maybe you're paying your tithes and you're doing everything that the the what you think is required of you because you're trying to work something up but your heart's not in it your heart hasn't been changed you don't love love God the way that you would if you're born again with that Agape life in you you can see you know in the in the in the Jews that what they would do is they would make these tombs like this uh you can see here in this picture and they would go and there's dead men's bones down on the inside of it but they would go through the graveyard and they would whitewash it so it was real bright and nice looking on the outside and you could maybe go walk through the graveyard and say well this is this looks really nice but on the inside there's rotting corpses and that's what somebody looks like in spiritually if they're trying to just they're just trying to come to church and act it out like a good Pharisee and say well well I'm I'm doing everything that outwardly looks like looks like what a Christian would do but inwardly their hearts not in it but the Holy Ghost was sent to purge your conscience from those kind of dead Works dead Works to set a living a living God a living reality where God is raised you from death to life and and in Mark uh Jesus would say he said he answered and said unto them well hath Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites is as it is written this people honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men what's what's Vain about the way they worshiped cuz their heart wasn't in it for laying aside the Commandment of God ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your tradition and another example that Jesus gave he said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess well isn't that kind of a gaggy Thing If you to go grab a dish out of the dishwasher out out of the sink that's not quite clean but maybe the outside's clean but on the inside you still got some ketchup and some leftovers in there you wouldn't want to eat out of that and the same thing with a with a with with a with a Pharisee or or somebody that's faking it somebody that's a hypocrite on the outside it looks clean but on the inside of it's full of full of Filth th blind Pharisee cleanse first that is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you are like unto wided suppers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness so you see you see the the the whole pattern of of cleaning out the inside first you get the inside clean first and then it's going to start working out you know behind me on this wall here is that pattern you you get Faith that God's faith on the inside and then it's going to start working out because works are going to be expressed from a life that's been changed and what are those works that we're talking of what are the works that are expressed what's the change in your life is the virtue of Christ and the knowledge of Christ and the patience of Christ and the temperance of Christ and the godliness of Christ that are working out from your heart being cleaned and from your heart being changed in Hebrews chapter 5 brother R said passed from Death un life that's what mean it means to be purged purged from dead Works to serve the Living God that you passed from Death unto life what do you care what the world thinks what do you care what your neighbor thinks our conscience has died and we're regenerated and Born Again by the spirit of God to serve the true and the Living God there you are your conscience has died to where you only because it's love you love God and you don't care what anybody else thinks that's right so Ephesians chapter 2 says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gifts of God not of works it's not you trying to satisfy a book of rules lest any man should boost boast for we are his workmanship it's it's Christ that does the work in you it's Christ that does the work of justification and sanctification it's Christ that does the work of filling you with the Holy Ghost and Christ that grows you and raises you up through the stature of perfect man we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus un what unto good good works because when you're changed your life your life there's going to be something that others can somebody's people are going to be able to tell that the light is on in your house in your Tabernacle which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them in James chapter 2 he said yeah a man may say thou H has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works cuz you've been purged from dead Works to serve the Living God thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble but wil thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar see us thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect what works are we talking about again but that's that's what the stature of a perfect man is it's the works of Christ Living in you to make you a living a living Idol a living Tabernacle so Paul if we keep going through uh the book of Hebrews in in chapter N9 he said and and and the musicians can go ahead and come we'll close on this for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament what a mediator someone that stands between two and also someone that says I am going to fulfill these promises he the mediator of the New Testament that my means of death for the Redemption of the of the transgressions that were under into the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth and we'll stop there you got a will that you have access to a testament every promise in the book is mine God bless you
