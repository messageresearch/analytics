[17:52] the seals there are six seals and then
[17:54] there's a break then there's a seventh

[17:58] ages and then brother branham come in
[18:00] and preach the ten virgins and he kind
[18:03] of there was a gap in those so we're
[18:04] gonna stop at the sixth seal because I
[18:07] want to catch up up here with them and
[18:09] not have the strain of teaching it down
[18:12] there going into the seventh seal so I'm

[18:45] sunday-school class don't have to listen
[18:46] to me come up here and repeat myself so
[18:49] well we we want you to pray for them
[18:53] that I told told them this morning we've
[18:55] got five me brother Dale Aaron Bob and
[19:01] Louise
[19:02] you got five four minutes
[19:04] here that was real good Wednesday night
[19:05] you the boy that was simple but you know
[19:06] what I got something out of wins you
[19:08] know if you don't get something out of a
[19:09] service you basically fell asleep and
[19:13] you didn't wake up and you're still
[19:14] asleep though you're awake but I never
[19:18] thought how that they even the witness
[19:20] of Jonah went with those guys to Joppa
[19:24] you know and and there was another
[19:26] witness that we didn't even think of in
[19:28] the Bible but that's that onion peel
[19:29] that's that's why I was saying about the
[19:30] seals the seals has a it has a meaning
[19:34] and then there's another layer and
[19:36] there's a natural happening then there's
[19:38] a spiritual happening then there's a
[19:40] supernatural happening so you've got
[19:42] different layers but the same onion peel
[19:45] now you can't start peeling bananas and
[19:47] you're supposed to be peeling onions you
[19:49] supposed to be peeling onions you peel
[19:51] that onion peel back then you get
[19:52] something every time you come to church
[19:54] so now that we know that we've got
[19:56] everything set up so far let's turn the
[19:58] revelations 10 verse 1 let's bow our
[20:00] heads before we get started tell me
[20:03] father Lord you surely are here with us
[20:06] today father because I believe we all
[20:08] brought our little lick of fire and I
[20:11] believe during the song service and all
[20:13] the things that we've done that we
[20:14] prayed we've done we've done all the
[20:17] duties of the church took up the
[20:18] offering prayed the prayer face for the
[20:21] sick now we pray Lord that you'll be
[20:23] with us in the further 'men of the
[20:24] service that you'll take control that
[20:27] you'll be the one that does the speaking
[20:28] in the hearing father we ask you Lord to
[20:31] bless the ones that are not here for
[20:33] many things that hinder people from
[20:35] coming to church father but we pray that
[20:36] you just clear those back in that that
[20:39] they'll be able to come on Lord's
[20:40] service father we ask that you just be
[20:42] with the missionaries on the foreign
[20:44] fields we always think about them Lord
[20:46] because our self have been there a few
[20:47] times and they give them their fruit for
[20:50] their labor and the things that they do

[20:56] kingdom and your honoring Lord today
[20:57] Lord just take care of us lead us and
[21:00] guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus
[21:01] name Amen
[21:03] and we are taking communion this
[21:04] afternoon so I want you to remember that
[21:07] Revelation is 10 verse 1 being first
[21:09] Sunday so I'll try not to be so I've
[21:13] been trying to keep another hour so it's
[21:15] not been too bad and I saw another
[21:16] mighty angel come
[21:17] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[21:19] rainbow was upon his head his face was
[21:22] it were the Sun and his feet as pillars
[21:23] of fire he had in his hand a little book
[21:25] open and he said his right foot upon the
[21:27] sea and his left foot upon the earth and
[21:29] cried with a loud voice it's when a lion
[21:31] roar and when he had cried seven
[21:33] thunders uttered their voices and when
[21:35] the seven thunders had uttered their
[21:36] voices I was about to write and I heard
[21:38] a voice from heaven saying unto me seal
[21:40] up those things which the seven thunders
[21:42] uttered and write them not and the angel
[21:45] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[21:47] the earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[21:48] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[21:51] ever who created heaven and the things
[21:52] that therein and what brother Dale
[21:54] talking about this morning we know who
[21:55] that is then that's the Creator God a
[21:57] man who created heaven and things that
[22:00] say and you know what he's not a things
[22:01] down here he just said the mighty angels
[22:04] come down all right so he come down here
[22:06] and we know the Prophet said that the
[22:07] seventh angel is on the earth at the
[22:09] time of that coming alright and swear by
[22:13] him that liveth for ever and ever he
[22:14] created heaven and the things that
[22:15] therein therein are and the earth and
[22:18] the things that therein are and the sea
[22:19] and the things which are therein he
[22:21] covered every bit of it that there
[22:22] should be time no longer but in the days
[22:25] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[22:26] he shall begin the sound and we're gonna
[22:28] we're going to try to tie that in this
[22:30] afternoon and then move on to another
[22:32] subject in this foundation the mystery
[22:34] of God should be finished as yes
[22:36] declared to his servants the prophets
[22:38] now let's go to Ephesians four now that
[22:40] says the servants the prophets not
[22:42] servant the prophet it takes all the
[22:45] prophets to build the body it takes all
[22:47] the prophets take all the prophets out
[22:49] of the Bible and you have no Bible okay
[22:52] and like brother Dale said this morning
[22:53] the Prophet is is a prophetic person
[22:56] that speaks the mind of God all right so
[22:59] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[23:01] of your mouth but that which is good to
[23:03] the use of edifying that it may Minister
[23:05] grace into the hearers and grieve not
[23:08] the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are
[23:10] sealed unto the day of redemption that
[23:13] you may be seated in the Lord I just
[23:15] blessing to the reading of the word and
[23:16] just kind of settle back and let's see
[23:19] what we can get into this will be
[23:20] foundation part three and we'll get in
[23:22] back into the chart in a minute and try
[23:24] not to make it look so messy I didn't
[23:26] know it looks so messy though I looked
[23:27] over this morning and saw it over there
[23:28] but well maybe try to clarify some
[23:31] things today
[23:31] but I want us to see in this foundation
[23:34] I want us to see why that the Prophet
[23:38] did what he did at the time he did it
[23:40] because remember all prophets come at
[23:42] the time that they're needed Paul didn't
[23:46] come when Irina was needed no Paul came
[23:49] and then Iranians came when Paul's
[23:51] message not Paul's message but when the
[23:53] people started diluting the message of
[23:56] Paul God brings up an arrhenius and then
[23:59] when when man gets in and starts
[24:01] denominating or tearing apart anybody's
[24:04] message all the messengers when they
[24:06] start tearing up God raised up another
[24:08] prophet no man but we know in the end
[24:10] time will see that this prophet in
[24:12] Malachi 4 has got two things he's got to
[24:15] do now the other ones like we were
[24:16] talking about last Sunday the other
[24:18] prophets down through the church ages
[24:19] they had one message they had one job to
[24:23] do bring a message what sound a trumpet
[24:27] a mess sound a trumpet either pronounce
[24:30] judgment or grace because remember when
[24:34] the Prophet hits the earth there's a war
[24:36] stars what a spiritual war not a natural
[24:39] war a spiritual work of the Prophet in
[24:41] other words comes in the place of God
[24:44] being on earth he comes and brings a
[24:46] message from God to the people they
[24:48] either accept it or they reject it when
[24:51] our same thing went with Paul Irena
[24:52] smartin all the way down to the end time
[24:54] but we come to this messenger Malachi 4
[24:56] and if you'll pull it up we'll read
[24:57] these just to recap and then we'll kind
[25:00] of start today on what I want to what I
[25:03] want us to see now this comes from the
[25:05] layout of Sein church age now this
[25:06] messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation is
[25:08] 10 7 see you got to take these two
[25:10] scriptures and you got to pull them
[25:11] apart then you got to bring them
[25:14] together alright cuz there's two things
[25:16] according to the prophet there's two
[25:18] things he's gonna do one according to
[25:20] Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[25:22] children to the father's no we talked
[25:24] about that Sunday and we'll draw it
[25:26] again up here at number 2 he will reveal
[25:29] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[25:31] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[25:34] contained in the seven seals as we were
[25:36] talking before remember the the
[25:38] rolled-up scroll this is your seal this
[25:40] is not the seal this is the seal the
[25:44] seal had to be broke
[25:45] so you could see what was inside of it
[25:47] that all right that sealed the sealed
[25:49] this is the wild horse riders Antichrist
[25:51] and he rides off when he does there's a
[25:53] thunder that opens up what's underneath
[25:55] that seal all right remember we were
[25:58] talking about the the boxcar sure the
[26:02] seal is important but the seal if that
[26:05] seal stays on there doesn't matter if
[26:06] there's millions of dollars worth of say
[26:09] we wanted to send it to Puerto Rico
[26:10] today and we send a container of food to
[26:13] feed those people and one and a man
[26:15] keeps it sealed a man says no there's a
[26:19] seal on it you can't have what's inside
[26:21] well then people will literally die
[26:23] unless that seals broke do you
[26:26] understand what I'm saying a man I'm not
[26:27] talking about natural now unless that
[26:29] seals broke whatever's inside is not
[26:31] going to be brought out and then it will
[26:34] remain a mystery and down to the church
[26:36] ages that has remained a mystery but now
[26:39] according to Malachi 4 and revelations
[26:41] 10 7 this prophet is to do two things
[26:44] and the second one he will reveal the
[26:46] mysteries of the seven thunders now
[26:48] watch he didn't say the mysteries of the
[26:50] seven seals first he said reveal the
[26:52] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[26:54] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[26:56] contained in the seven seals it will be
[26:59] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[27:02] that literally turn the hearts of the
[27:03] children to the pentecostal fathers
[27:05] exactly so but consider this also this
[27:08] prophet messenger will be in his nature
[27:10] of manner as were Elijah and John now we
[27:12] know he's the fourth coming he's talked
[27:14] about itself the people of this prophet
[27:16] messengers day will be as they were in
[27:17] Ahab's day and enjoy and we'll cover
[27:19] that in just a minute and since it is
[27:22] only the children whose hearts will be
[27:24] turned by is only children who will
[27:25] listen so look it will only be the
[27:29] children that will listen because the
[27:31] children have to be raised up to a place
[27:33] to where you show as natural adoption
[27:37] you take a child and you raise and train
[27:39] him up to an adult or heading toward
[27:42] adulthood and then you give him
[27:44] responsibilities that all right
[27:45] mmm all right so let's go to faith I
[27:51] like this quote because I believe it's
[27:53] it's it's pertaining to us listen god
[27:55] bless you
[27:56] well tell you just one thing I know I'm
[27:58] holding along but
[27:59] want this one thing I know and I want
[28:00] you to remember there's something fixing
[28:02] to happen remember I told you that
[28:04] there's a step up coming in the church
[28:06] now see these things that you're now
[28:08] seeing are going to be just little
[28:10] things after a while see that's why you
[28:13] go to Paul and Paul said let's leaving
[28:16] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[28:17] let us go on to perfection he didn't say
[28:19] you raised him he said what in other
[28:21] words used them for a foundation he
[28:25] never said to do away with water baptism
[28:26] no but he said we don't have to preach
[28:29] on water baptism every service we don't
[28:31] have to preach on receiving the Holy
[28:32] Ghost every service now it's got to be
[28:34] hid we know that we know there's
[28:36] different levels but he said there's got
[28:38] to be in other words Paul said there's
[28:39] got to be a group that that goes higher
[28:41] than that that goes up more in same way
[28:43] we're brother branham watch some things
[28:46] are moving I say this by the power of
[28:47] the revelation of Jesus Christ whom I
[28:49] everyone in our doctrine in our baptism
[28:52] we come to a place but there's some key
[28:55] that unlocks something here now he saw
[28:59] the book sealed on seven seals and when
[29:00] the Daniel saw the same we will read it
[29:02] in a minute and when the thunders
[29:04] uttered their voices he said don't write
[29:05] what that was in the scripture but it be
[29:08] revealed in the last days we're at the
[29:10] time were at Kadish and that's 1953 a
[29:14] long time ago and then so he saw
[29:18] something coming and we know for a fact
[29:20] what he was it was that new ministry
[29:21] moving in he just didn't know what to
[29:23] call it it was in that new ministry part
[29:25] he was coming - alright number three
[29:27] let's read this again and I'm gonna
[29:29] condense this I'm gonna read I'm gonna
[29:31] read number nine or paragraph nine and
[29:35] then 27 I read this the whole thing last
[29:37] week but I just want to give you a
[29:39] refresher course questions and answers
[29:41] on the seals then also knowing that
[29:43] right among you things are happening
[29:45] that I just know I know that you don't
[29:47] see it now listen folks I'm not talking
[29:49] to you he's talking to them okay because
[29:54] somebody told me the other day said and
[29:55] said well we're trying we're I'm not
[29:57] talking to you he's talking to them I'm
[29:59] just telling you what he's telling them
[30:01] sitting physically in his congregation
[30:03] that day I know that you don't see it
[30:06] see I'm just positive that you don't see
[30:08] it see and you say brother Brown that's
[30:10] hard thing for you to say that I know it
[30:12] is but look
[30:13] me save this just say this now I suppose
[30:18] this is just taped for ourselves and so
[30:19] forth but let me say this I see that you
[30:21] don't you don't get it and you're not
[30:23] supposed to get it so don't try to
[30:26] interpret anything don't try to put your
[30:28] interpretation to it you'll only get
[30:29] further away now drop down to paragraph
[30:31] 27 you remember all that he went through
[30:33] about radio and all that but watch he
[30:36] left them on out he left them away just
[30:38] like a prophet left the way out David
[30:42] was dead as a hammer if if the Prophet
[30:45] didn't step on the scene and say David
[30:47] you won't die I prayed for you Nathan
[30:49] stood in the gap brother branham stood
[30:52] in the gap there's something was going
[30:54] to happen but he knew that it had to
[30:56] come from a certain group of people
[30:58] because watch now you might may believe
[31:02] that somebody's singing this certain
[31:03] song that might not even be there see
[31:05] but when it actually strikes the crystal
[31:08] that it's supposed to strike then it
[31:12] gives a true interpretation and
[31:14] vindicates it by showing the picture see
[31:17] what I mean so what is he telling them
[31:19] he said to go on with the same simple
[31:20] message in other words I was telling the
[31:22] church today this morning downstairs
[31:25] look we're a special group of people God
[31:29] is dealing with this bride God is
[31:32] dealing with his bride in ways that he's
[31:34] never dealt with his bride before
[31:36] because that group of people has never
[31:39] been on this earth before amen but we're
[31:43] here now this is our time this is our
[31:45] place you're talking about a place that
[31:47] when we realize what we're doing here
[31:49] and what part of this message that we're
[31:52] supposed to bring I was telling them
[31:54] this morning even with the church ages
[31:57] and the seals and all bringing
[31:59] everything together we can talk we can
[32:02] talk we can talk to thing we can talk to
[32:05] Iranian San Martin and even Paul to a
[32:08] certain degree and tell him things and
[32:10] he never knew but not head knowledge we
[32:14] can't it's got to be a revelation called
[32:19] Paul a no real quick if it was a
[32:21] revelation or if it was you talking
[32:23] Paul would know because Paul the Prophet
[32:25] same with brother branham that's why I
[32:26] brother Brad said this he knew that they
[32:29] were saying brother Branham great
[32:30] message and never heard anything like
[32:32] that before but it was not striking the
[32:35] right crystal that is supposed to strike
[32:36] it's supposed to strike somebody and
[32:39] what be and come into fruition come to a
[32:43] manifestation that he was not seeing at
[32:46] that time that's why the seals were for
[32:50] a special group of people it was not for
[32:53] them I'm not saying that he said it
[32:55] you're not supposed to get it I'm not
[32:58] talking to you I'm not talking to you on
[33:01] the internet brother Branham saying that
[33:03] to his group of people okay he said but
[33:06] go on with the same simple message and
[33:08] what happens is people has tried to make
[33:10] it all these different things and you
[33:12] see what in the world the mess it is
[33:13] it's surely become a mess agent no doubt
[33:19] so now let's read number four and then
[33:23] we'll read a couple of scriptures here
[33:24] number four is this the sign of the end
[33:27] sir now what are we looking at now
[33:30] brother Branham preached the message we
[33:34] got it in booking tape and I read where
[33:35] he said we got it in booking tape form
[33:37] and we've read it now for 50 something
[33:40] years amen
[33:41] we've read it in listen for 50 something
[33:44] years and you and I don't say some
[33:47] people may say nothing's happened I say
[33:49] that God's working and bringing people
[33:51] to a manifestation it's just not that
[33:54] manifestation that we're fixing to look
[33:56] at and then where some have went on with
[33:59] the same simple message some has like
[34:01] brother Dale and I were talking another
[34:03] day and it's true
[34:04] there's there's certain times and I'm
[34:06] gonna say this cuz he said it but I'm
[34:08] gonna tell you he said it that there's a
[34:10] certain group even message believers
[34:13] that the preachers preach just enough to
[34:15] keep you safe just enough to keep the
[34:18] Holy Ghost in you you say well you can't
[34:21] come out of me no but you can grieve it
[34:22] I just read that in from the Bible but
[34:26] message is coming to a place to where I
[34:29] don't know something you've got a little
[34:31] bit sideways when somebody said that
[34:32] somebody was preaching a Baptist
[34:34] doctrine that's exactly what it is if
[34:35] you're not preaching
[34:37] if you're not preaching this second part
[34:39] of brother branham's message you're
[34:41] preaching a Baptist dr. Paul dotes do
[34:45] you say man if you won't do I really
[34:46] don't care you're preaching a Baptist
[34:49] doctrine because that's not what that
[34:54] message that he brought is talking about
[34:59] the first part is to what turn us back
[35:02] to the faith of the father's Amen but
[35:08] that's not his message the seventh
[35:11] angels message was to bring the
[35:14] headstone and a Baptist came bringing a
[35:17] headstone sorry the mysteries here
[35:22] number four the mystery here is the
[35:25] mystery a mystery of Scripture is a
[35:28] previously hidden truth now divinely
[35:31] revealed but which is a supernatural
[35:34] element still remains despite the
[35:36] revelation people got a revelation
[35:39] people got revelation of this and
[35:41] revelation of that but there's a
[35:42] supernatural part that only a
[35:44] supernatural group of people are going
[35:46] to get hey listen you get mad at me if
[35:52] you want to I don't care they got mad at
[35:54] Jesus when he told them they was of a
[35:58] Baptist faith you of your father the
[36:04] devil I'm not talking about people but I
[36:07] promise you listen folks i I took a
[36:09] quote out of here a brother branham or
[36:12] heat toward the nominations to pieces
[36:14] and I left it out but it's in there he
[36:18] wasn't nice when it comes to the
[36:19] nominations and we shouldn't be either
[36:21] could you know what that's a compromiser
[36:24] it's becoming now to where I am NOT a
[36:27] compromiser I'm not compromising I'm not
[36:30] even compromising with the people in the
[36:31] message not anymore and after all that
[36:33] junk I heard about different you know
[36:36] different things and you say well you're
[36:38] just you're just like brother Dale you
[36:40] know everybody says well you just you
[36:42] know you I don't think we're there
[36:44] enough I don't think we're to the place
[36:46] to where we can say you
[36:50] you are not preaching what Paul preached
[36:51] you know what brother I'm said we'd come
[36:53] to a place where you're not saying what
[36:55] Paul said why can't we stand up and say
[36:57] you're not saying what brother Branham
[36:59] said you're teaching the people wrong on
[37:01] the seals you teaching them wrong on
[37:02] Daniel 70 weeks you're teaching them
[37:04] wrong on the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:06] now all we got to do is just believe the
[37:07] message well that's a lie the devil if
[37:10] that's all we got to do I received it
[37:15] through justification sanctification in
[37:17] the baptism the Holy Ghost I was born of
[37:20] a man and a woman and so were you so
[37:21] you're not gonna get it any other way
[37:23] amen if not then God is a respect to a
[37:26] person so now let's read here in Daniel
[37:30] Daniel 2 verse 18 says now watch 1 this
[37:34] is Daniel that they would desire mercies
[37:37] of the God of heaven concerning this
[37:39] secret now remember Daniel is talking
[37:41] about the vision that one of them has
[37:44] the writing on the wall and he's waiting
[37:46] on God doing her to interpret it to him
[37:48] what that they would desire now we'll
[37:51] see we've we've had a writing on the
[37:52] wall we've had a writing on the wall
[37:56] that says what many many tinkle up or
[37:58] sin you better get ready now this is
[38:02] your time to get ready because you have
[38:04] been waiting the balances and found
[38:05] wanting
[38:06] alright then was the secret no let's
[38:11] read the first part what's this that
[38:12] they would desire mercies of the God of
[38:15] heaven concerning this secret that
[38:17] Daniel and his fellow should not perish
[38:20] with the rest of the wives men of
[38:22] Babylon what is God doing God is
[38:24] separating remember God is a
[38:26] segregationist prophet of God said he
[38:29] was he he wanted Israel to stay away
[38:31] from everything but you know what the
[38:32] problem was they all got mingled in
[38:33] together then was the secret revealed
[38:37] unto Daniel in a night vision then
[38:39] Daniel blessed the God of heaven Daniel
[38:42] answered and said blessed be the name of
[38:43] God for ever and ever
[38:45] for wisdom and miter his and he changes
[38:48] the times and the seasons he removeth
[38:51] kings and setteth up kings he giveth
[38:53] wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to
[38:56] them that know understanding he
[38:58] revealeth the deep and secret things he
[39:01] knoweth what is in the
[39:03] and the light dwelleth with him Amen so
[39:07] now let's go to first Corinthians 2
[39:08] verse 7 but we speak the wisdom of God
[39:11] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[39:14] which God ordained before the world unto
[39:17] our glory now remember there's a
[39:19] supernatural element you can there's
[39:21] there's layers to this you can read the
[39:23] Bible all every day of your life and die
[39:25] and go to hell but you can't read the
[39:27] Bible read Revelation because revelation
[39:31] will change you amen so watch which none
[39:37] of the princes of this world knew for
[39:40] had they known it they would not have
[39:41] crucified the Lord of glory now remember
[39:44] brother Branham preached the indictment
[39:46] what he indicted a generation for the
[39:50] second crucifixion of Christ who was he
[39:53] talking to the denomination but God but
[40:01] as it is written
[40:02] I'm not seen nor ear heard neither have
[40:05] entered into the heart of man the things
[40:06] which God has prepared for them that
[40:08] love him but God have to reveal them
[40:11] unto us by his Spirit for the spirit
[40:14] searches all things you see that it
[40:16] searches all things yea the deep things
[40:19] of God never look the deep things of God
[40:21] are not going to come to you just
[40:22] sitting somewhere under a tree you've
[40:24] got what you've got to search them out
[40:27] and then you've got to assert you got
[40:29] you know the words you've got to want it
[40:31] because remember to me the deep things
[40:33] of God are the most simple things that
[40:36] we can understand how would God make it
[40:39] so deep that out what how would you make
[40:43] it so deep that an illiterate man can
[40:45] get born again how can that happen can't
[40:48] happen for what man knoweth the things
[40:52] of God save the spirit of Man which is
[40:55] in him so in other words in your natural
[40:57] spirit you can't understand God it's
[41:01] contrary to God we've stopped minded
[41:04] this morning there's there's things that
[41:05] that that bombard our minds and controls
[41:09] us yeah it still controls us a little
[41:11] bit we let them control us in our spirit
[41:15] realm
[41:16] not a soul but in the spirit realm we
[41:18] have a lot of things that's that still
[41:19] that we got to get we can't divorce
[41:22] there's no divorce in this message one
[41:28] more time there's no divorce in this
[41:29] message your husband's got to be dead
[41:32] before you can make Christ or what you
[41:35] are you're committing adultery
[41:36] amen now we have received not the spirit
[41:39] of the world but the Spirit which is of
[41:42] God we are the very manifestation of God
[41:46] what brother Devils how much this
[41:47] morning we are the manifestation of God
[41:50] on earth we have God has in more feed
[41:53] from all those in war fees brother Dale
[41:55] was talking about he's he morphing into
[41:56] a bride mmm and look we can't do
[42:01] anything but what the Spirit tells us to
[42:03] do that we might know the things that
[42:05] are freely given to us of God which
[42:08] things also we speak so in other words
[42:11] we have something to say but it's not us
[42:14] saying it not in the words which man's
[42:16] wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost
[42:19] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[42:22] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[42:25] not the things of the Spirit of God for
[42:28] they are foolishness unto Him neither
[42:31] can he know them because they are what
[42:34] spiritually discerned you and I listen
[42:39] we are third pool people amen
[42:46] the second pool was the discernment the
[42:49] third pool was the speaking of the word
[42:52] we should be through and we should be
[42:55] able to discern not by taking somebody
[42:57] by the hand but discern what discern
[43:00] with the spirit that's inside of you
[43:02] whether what somebody's telling you is
[43:04] the truth or not but the natural man
[43:06] receiveth not the things of the Spirit
[43:07] of God for they are foolishness unto him
[43:09] neither can he know them because they
[43:11] are spiritually discerned but he that is
[43:14] spiritual judges to all things high in
[43:17] the world you think we're going to stand
[43:18] in judgment and go oh I don't know no
[43:23] judgment is sure judgment is true
[43:26] judgment will not fail God cannot
[43:29] say oops you and I can say us but oops
[43:34] it's not in God's vocabulary hey man so
[43:37] we must be able to spiritually judge all
[43:39] things yet he himself is judged of no
[43:43] man for who hath known the mind of the
[43:46] Lord that he may instruct him question
[43:49] but we have the mind of Christ that's
[43:52] the only way we can understand it is to
[43:54] have the mind of Christ is that Alright
[43:56] say ma'am amen so now let's go back to
[44:00] our chart just for a moment because what
[44:03] I want you to see something else that
[44:06] that we were talking about this morning
[44:11] don't collapse again now we were talking
[44:15] about the more draw a bigger one yeah
[44:19] buddy see that Danny can you see that
[44:20] you see it okay sure enough okay if you
[44:24] can't I'll turn it on around a little
[44:25] more but I want us to look how's that
[44:28] there glare that okay all right then
[44:31] remember now you and I you and I are
[44:38] looking at this as the statue of a
[44:41] perfect man which is fine and that's
[44:43] okay we can do that but I want you to
[44:45] see something that how that the Lord
[44:47] lays this in Scripture in two different
[44:50] ways that's why I want you to see that
[44:51] brother branham he tells us that that
[44:53] one seal can tie the entire Bible
[44:56] together so anything now that we look at
[45:00] we can tie back to what we have
[45:01] previously been taught if you've never
[45:05] been taught it how you going to get it
[45:06] that's a background that's that's
[45:08] looking at what you've already seen
[45:11] that's why brother Branham couldn't
[45:13] bring this statue of a perfect man after
[45:15] the seals he had to bring them before
[45:19] because this is to remember this is the
[45:21] faith of the fathers right here and then
[45:24] this is the faith of the fathers alright
[45:27] then you got your gap and then this is
[45:30] the headstone obviously but remember it
[45:35] was rejected and it's gone out of the
[45:38] church
[45:40] he built his church on the Son of God
[45:42] revelation amen
[45:44] this is your seven ages right here seven
[45:48] Church ages if I got that say Amen all
[45:52] right now look where were the seven
[45:53] churches in the Book of Revelations
[45:55] Revelation is one chapter one through
[45:57] Chapter three right is that right
[46:00] revelations one through three is the
[46:02] church ages all right then you've got
[46:05] chapter four I like what I like what I
[46:08] still feasting on what William said
[46:10] about that comma that comma in come past
[46:13] 2000 years so this line right here is
[46:17] going to be revelation 4:1 because
[46:21] remember in the seven churches when the
[46:23] rapture takes place is that right saying
[46:25] ma'am all right now remember we got to
[46:29] be called out of the age and we'll look
[46:30] at that in a minute
[46:31] but revelation is for one didn't watch
[46:33] his brother branham do when he comes in
[46:34] and preaches the breach which is
[46:37] revelations chapter five that all right
[46:41] now watch revelation 6 that's the
[46:47] opening of the seals one through the
[46:49] rest of the chapter cuz remember folks
[46:52] and we'll get to it a little bit later
[46:53] there's only really six seals that has
[46:56] any kind of that has any kind of
[47:00] commentary all right some of you just
[47:05] keep going to sleep that'll be fine with
[47:07] me you're going to sleep right on into
[47:10] the Tribulation Period
[47:12] this needs to be important you need to
[47:14] listen to this revelation 6 verse 1
[47:19] through whatever is the opening of the
[47:21] seals so the seals weren't to open in
[47:23] the church ages per say we had to be
[47:26] called out of the ages
[47:28] revelations 5 is what Redemption a man
[47:33] are that's the breach between the two
[47:38] now watch this now brother Branham tells
[47:42] us into waters of separation now they've
[47:46] got that one I believe you can pull that
[47:48] one up if you want to I I inserted this
[47:50] one now look how many of you know but
[47:54] where you read the quote how many you
[47:55] know there were seven church ages in the
[47:56] Old Testament
[47:57] right and I can place a few of them but
[48:01] I don't have time that's not what I'm
[48:02] preaching on now all right but we know
[48:04] one thing's for sure the middle of the
[48:06] ages the middle of our ages was right
[48:10] here and that's when church and state
[48:12] married is that all right right going
[48:15] into the Dark Ages what Constantine
[48:17] married Rome proper with Rome spiritual
[48:23] and I use it as a lute very loosely
[48:24] right now brother Branham says here
[48:28] Watch
[48:29] Israel natural and the Gentile Church in
[48:31] spiritual seven Church ages right in the
[48:33] middle I didn't have time to put right
[48:35] here but watch what he says and Israel
[48:40] had seven church ages right in its bloom
[48:43] of its best came a hab and married this
[48:45] idolatry brought in an idolatry in and
[48:48] caused idolatry in Israel the Christian
[48:51] Church did the same thing in the Dark
[48:53] Ages
[48:53] come right in and made writing the same
[48:55] thing and brought our Dollar Tree so the
[48:58] seven churches in the Old Testament the
[49:02] Middle Ages was they having Jezebel
[49:04] remember when church and state married
[49:06] its again or the first time then
[49:09] churches stayed married again in the
[49:11] Gentile so there are seven church ages
[49:13] in the Old Testament and seven in the
[49:15] new now here's the whole thing I want
[49:17] you to see as the continuity of this is
[49:19] not just a pyramid doctrine brother
[49:21] Brown keeps telling us that and it's not
[49:23] because remember these seven church ages
[49:26] you had what you had seven ages well
[49:28] what was the seventh aged in the Old
[49:30] Testament John the Baptist
[49:34] Elijah coming at the end of the age
[49:38] that's not for me
[49:39] Elijah coming at the end of the age to
[49:42] what introduce the headstone John comes
[49:46] at the end of the church ages in the Old
[49:49] Testament to bring what he brings
[49:53] Redemption repent and introduces the
[49:58] head what did the property God do comes
[50:02] at the end of the age
[50:07] and introduces the head so there you got
[50:11] your time for your church ages even in
[50:13] the Old Testament New Testament brought
[50:15] into revelations one through three which
[50:17] is the church ages for one there's a
[50:19] rapture okay
[50:23] revelations five is showing the scene of
[50:25] redemption amen and then revelation 6 is
[50:29] that second part of brother branham's
[50:31] ministry so the ministry of brother
[50:32] branham it covers what all the church
[50:34] ages there's not a doctrine he brought
[50:38] that wasn't in the church ages in his
[50:41] first part of his message of his message
[50:43] right but now the second part light had
[50:46] never shined on that there was never a
[50:49] person preached and broke those seals
[50:51] except Jesus himself and he was rejected
[50:55] and cast away in the church ages right
[51:00] but now at the end of the age we have a
[51:04] prophet comes on the scene stands in the
[51:07] breech and brings a message and that
[51:11] message is the revelation contained in
[51:14] the seven seals which are the thunders
[51:17] that no one had ever looked at before
[51:19] now remember brother Branham also told
[51:22] us he said this Lavis in age is a very
[51:24] short age John's message was six months
[51:28] long John the Baptist message was only
[51:32] six months a great powerful message but
[51:36] it was only six months so it was a great
[51:37] message but what his only concern was
[51:40] introducing the head
[51:43] now what did John do John turned back
[51:49] remember
[51:50] hearts of the children to the father's
[51:52] fathers to the children John did one the
[51:55] property God did the other right all
[51:58] right so he's brought us up to a place
[52:00] so we're not caught in the church ages
[52:02] we got to be it's like Paul said Paul
[52:06] said we we're raptured already sitting
[52:08] in heavenly places and then people go to
[52:09] preaching we're already in the
[52:10] Millennium well hey guess what happens
[52:13] now people in Jamaica are preaching that
[52:15] we're already in the Millennium I told
[52:17] them I said take them to the zoo
[52:19] take them to the zoo put them in with
[52:23] the wine and let's see if that line will
[52:28] weigh down and not give you any problems
[52:33] so how foolish no but look people hang
[52:35] on that doctrine we laugh about these
[52:38] different doctrines but take some people
[52:40] hang their very soul on those doctors so
[52:43] we need to be careful all right so when
[52:45] I look so that's the great plan so we
[52:47] see now that that this is foundation and
[52:52] what was I mean you read the church age
[52:54] book all the major doctrines are in that
[52:56] church age book amen all the major
[52:59] doctrines of this message is in that
[53:01] church age book amen
[53:02] but we got a bit but we got to come up
[53:05] higher than that
[53:07] the call was come up get yourself out of
[53:10] the ages and come up into the headstone
[53:14] which the headstone will read it all
[53:16] while we know that's Christ that's the
[53:18] message of Jesus Christ back in its
[53:21] power in its position because remember
[53:24] the position that the I'm go back again
[53:27] that did I miss the mission of the
[53:29] denominations is just really that right
[53:31] there no right right right there they
[53:36] don't bring the headstone so they're
[53:40] stuck they're stuck in the church age
[53:43] that's why they you gonna go by the
[53:45] grave if you don't because you don't
[53:47] have enough to get all the way out
[53:49] you've got your forty nine seven times
[53:51] seven
[53:52] this is folks this is the Jubilee we've
[53:55] been looking for this is the Jubilee
[53:57] this will be the bride's revival sure
[54:00] they have small revivals in here but
[54:02] this is the bride's revival in the end
[54:04] time you and I have got listen there was
[54:08] no voice of the resurrection in here oh
[54:11] sure people will raise from the dead but
[54:13] they died again this right here this man
[54:17] died but will never die again why
[54:21] because there's where the body change
[54:23] comes from somebody's got to raise up in
[54:25] the lap we got to get off of our
[54:31] this and get into Christ you say I'm
[54:36] doing the best I can keep trying keep
[54:40] trying listen keep listening and don't
[54:43] just say well I don't believe that and
[54:45] just cut it off you go right ahead
[54:47] I'll do your funeral me a brother there
[54:52] one but that's the way it looks now
[55:01] dude this church ages because there was
[55:04] denominations in those churches right
[55:08] penticoff badness methods well I'm
[55:10] telling you you preach this right here
[55:12] then you preach this too you preach a
[55:14] Baptist message but that right there
[55:17] it's what they can't find they can't
[55:20] find that stone why because that stone
[55:23] is a revelation that they've never had
[55:25] before
[55:25] hey man you can live right sisters you
[55:28] can drag your dress to the ground hair
[55:30] whatever men you can say well I've been
[55:32] in this message 30-something years 40
[55:34] something it doesn't matter until we
[55:37] received that message that message of
[55:41] the opening of the seven seals and in
[55:43] then into the deep things of God into
[55:46] the things that we need to listen
[55:48] there's only gonna be a few that will
[55:51] but you know what I'm dumb enough to
[55:52] believe it sister bail that I'm the one
[55:55] if there's one vowel said don't forget
[56:00] me don't forget I said God's not gonna
[56:02] forget you you got plenty of time you
[56:06] know what you decide whether you have
[56:08] time or not you decide because God's
[56:11] never gonna ask you Mark why'd it take
[56:13] you so long become a Christian you know
[56:15] why cuz y'all ready how long you become
[56:17] Christian you're just answering your own
[56:20] question no God's gonna say there's my
[56:25] son you gonna listen to what he says
[56:28] cuz he's come to a place that I can give
[56:32] him the sword and he can do the work you
[56:35] give some people a sword and they'll
[56:37] kill people with it right the wrong
[56:39] people but you give the sword brother
[56:41] Bramson in a skillful hand
[56:43] a hand of strong faith that's what we
[56:47] got to have we got to have faith that we
[56:50] are going to be raised up out of the
[56:52] church ages that we are going to come
[56:53] through and see the greatest plan of
[56:55] redemption that ever was to be told and
[56:58] that is what to wit the redemption of
[57:01] our body amen
[57:02] now listen some of your older ones some
[57:04] of you younger ones like Joe signs that
[57:07] names like why didn't all people talking
[57:09] about why don't they want body change I
[57:11] get up in the morning at night I run two
[57:13] miles and I need all I want I don't help
[57:16] me you what do you get 50 something
[57:17] years old 60 70 80 these places are
[57:22] hurting you you didn't even know you had
[57:25] that's why we're groaning we're groaning
[57:28] and travailing what together - what -
[57:33] wit the redemption of our body that's
[57:36] what we got to come to you all right so
[57:38] let's go to the next let's go to number
[57:39] five there by alright with that saying
[57:41] man so you had seven churches so you see
[57:44] how you see how parallels all this
[57:46] background that we've been through for
[57:48] all these years
[57:50] brother Adams message came perfect
[57:53] perfect staff step right up the line
[57:56] those messages were never preached out
[57:58] of order those messages were ordained of
[58:01] God it's the only way we're going to get
[58:04] it
[58:04] look spoken words original seed statue
[58:08] of a perfect man all preached before the
[58:09] seals but it's something that we had to
[58:11] have for a foundation to get us to the
[58:15] seals and then he gets to there and he
[58:18] says well this is nothing for you in
[58:20] other words stay back here eats what he
[58:24] told you in your Jackson what he tell
[58:25] junior Jackson stay here and look on
[58:27] this right staying here and look on this
[58:30] what brother brown said I left them and
[58:33] went to Arizona for what to see that and
[58:37] to come back with that man that all
[58:40] right say man I just want to get this is
[58:42] just the background this is just the
[58:43] foundation but I watch number five the
[58:47] breach we read this last Sunday and
[58:50] we're reading in and revealed as the
[58:55] seals break and are released to us
[58:57] then we can see what this great plan of
[59:00] redemption is and when and how it's
[59:03] going to be done it's all hidden in this
[59:05] book of mystery here next time about the
[59:07] Bible it's sealed up with seven seals
[59:10] and so the lamb is the only one who can
[59:13] break them and the whole thing here the
[59:15] seven seals got the mysteries of God
[59:17] from the foundation of the world all
[59:19] sealed up like we were talking about all
[59:22] sealed up in there and revealed by seven
[59:27] different seals that if God willing let
[59:29] him let us pull back those seals and
[59:32] look down through the book and find out
[59:34] what it's all about oh I hope we have a
[59:36] great time there the mystery of
[59:38] redemption is sealed until this book
[59:39] could not be broken until the last
[59:42] angels message the scrolls there we note
[59:45] it was there we knowed it was Redemption
[59:47] we believed it was Redemption all right
[59:50] so now let's go to the breach now see
[59:55] the mystery of the seven sealed book
[59:56] will be revealed at the sounding of the
[59:59] seventh Church ages message see the
[1:00:01] seventh angel begins to sound and
[1:00:03] there's the messages wrote out there and
[1:00:05] we got it and take that book for him he
[1:00:07] was pretty plain about who who where it
[1:00:09] was to come from I told him this morning
[1:00:11] I read a quote last night where brother
[1:00:13] Brown said please believe my message and
[1:00:15] he stops he says I mean his message it's
[1:00:20] his message not mine
[1:00:22] God corrected him he felt checked he
[1:00:24] said please believe in my message and
[1:00:26] then he stopped and he said no it's not
[1:00:28] my message
[1:00:29] it's his message hey man so this is all
[1:00:31] the message this comes straight from God
[1:00:34] this was not manhandle this comes
[1:00:38] straight from God so you believe it or
[1:00:40] not if you want to that's okay you have
[1:00:42] a free moral agency but look I want to
[1:00:43] show you - now look in the time that we
[1:00:46] have had all this teaching remember the
[1:00:49] teaching that we gave you brother Dale
[1:00:51] and I both was talking about the the
[1:00:54] messenger coming at the end of the age
[1:00:55] Amen you know you had seven you got
[1:01:02] seven Church agents right all right
[1:01:04] there by pay attention
[1:01:05] you had seven Church ages Paul though
[1:01:08] had to come at the end of the age well
[1:01:09] what do you come at the NDA
[1:01:11] of the first age he can't he can't he
[1:01:17] can't be the message of Ephesus and come
[1:01:19] at the end of the Ephesian age so he
[1:01:22] comes at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:01:25] Pentecost 50 he comes at the age of
[1:01:30] Pentecost here is an age of Pentecost
[1:01:31] right here he comes at the end of the
[1:01:34] Pentecostals rebukes them and brings his
[1:01:37] message then hook eye rainiest comes in
[1:01:39] here at the end of what Ephesus comes
[1:01:45] and brings this message because when
[1:01:47] this starts going down there's a
[1:01:48] messenger brings it back up when this
[1:01:51] starts going down and it goes down after
[1:01:53] the messenger is gone some of these
[1:01:57] messengers like Columbo was dead before
[1:01:59] the age started but what he preached
[1:02:00] carried right over on into the age right
[1:02:03] but now you look here we see that if we
[1:02:06] have we got
[1:02:07] Paul Irina's Martin sometimes like in
[1:02:11] Calamba all the way through now we got
[1:02:13] would come up to brother Brown now watch
[1:02:14] let's read a quote him trying to do God
[1:02:17] a service without being his will 1965
[1:02:20] now God hasn't provided an original way
[1:02:22] to do things and he'll never do it
[1:02:24] country I told him downstairs God is
[1:02:27] just he is just constant that's why I
[1:02:30] can depend on the word that's like
[1:02:31] independent God he's consistent like I
[1:02:34] said God never has an oops moment it's
[1:02:37] always exactly what he says that's how
[1:02:39] it's gonna be now he promised in the
[1:02:41] last days that what he would do and it
[1:02:45] sent them us the message and this
[1:02:47] message would have the same
[1:02:49] identification as Elijah had as he lost
[1:02:52] your head as John the Baptist head
[1:02:53] turned the hearts of the people not to
[1:02:56] the denomination but back to the
[1:02:58] original apostolate fathers back to the
[1:03:01] word see remember denominations didn't
[1:03:04] begin until about right here coming to
[1:03:07] the dark ages then Roman Catholic and
[1:03:09] then you come into y'all you about they
[1:03:10] weren't down here the first three ages
[1:03:12] were pure no dot indoctrination but
[1:03:17] little things were coming in but what
[1:03:21] but back to the original Apostolic
[1:03:23] fathers back to the word how these
[1:03:26] things have been have indicated how that
[1:03:29] in the sounding of the last angel
[1:03:31] revelations 10 in the days of the
[1:03:32] seventh angel these mysteries that's all
[1:03:34] been why did the Methodists do this and
[1:03:37] the Baptist's in the Church of Christ
[1:03:38] Jehovah Witness all do that the
[1:03:41] mysteries will be revealed in the last
[1:03:43] day when the seven angels seventh angels
[1:03:47] message when he not when he starts out
[1:03:50] doing this but when he begins to sound
[1:03:53] his message see not the years in
[1:03:56] preparation but when he begins to sound
[1:03:59] the message these mysteries will be
[1:04:01] revealed and here they are not knowing
[1:04:04] them and you people are a witness now
[1:04:06] let's go to work she's faced this press
[1:04:07] 1965 but remember Abraham wasn't in
[1:04:11] Sodom he was called out and there was
[1:04:13] one state and talked to him what brother
[1:04:15] there was someone this morning and the
[1:04:17] one stayed and talked to him showed him
[1:04:18] a sign with his back turned he and Sarah
[1:04:21] was gonna have the baby that he had
[1:04:23] waited on him with his back turned
[1:04:24] he called it God Elohim now that brings
[1:04:27] to pass today because we have faith and
[1:04:31] I know this is of God is because this in
[1:04:34] other scriptures point to this our
[1:04:36] revelations 10 said in the hour of the
[1:04:39] seventh angels message when he begins to
[1:04:41] sound forth his message not in a healing
[1:04:44] service but the message that follows the
[1:04:48] healing service amen
[1:04:50] then all rights amen now number nine
[1:04:53] let's read it - and then we'll stop and
[1:04:55] go back for a minute
[1:04:56] I have heard but now I see 1965 these
[1:05:00] are all after the seals they right
[1:05:02] before it God takes him off the scene
[1:05:03] now we're promised to church age through
[1:05:06] reformers and we've had them but he
[1:05:08] promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his
[1:05:10] pattern in the last days that would take
[1:05:13] place to turn the hearts of the children
[1:05:14] back to the faith of the Apostolic
[1:05:16] fathers for that very purpose and the
[1:05:19] church is so broke up in denominations
[1:05:21] and isms so in the message it's so tore
[1:05:24] to pieces till it's dead I didn't say
[1:05:29] that he did you know I told him other
[1:05:33] day when brother Branham called those
[1:05:34] denominational churches
[1:05:35] Raja's he pronounced judgment and
[1:05:38] they're nothing more than logic go to
[1:05:41] one and see so much confusion they just
[1:05:44] whatever they want to do they do it I
[1:05:46] mean there's no reverence they just
[1:05:48] completely got away from the Word of God
[1:05:49] sorry but that's just what it is it's
[1:05:54] been a carrier it had the word at one
[1:05:55] time and then he promised in the hour of
[1:05:58] the seventh angels message the seven
[1:06:00] seals would be revealed and the
[1:06:02] mysteries of God would be declared when
[1:06:05] the seventh angel begins to sound this
[1:06:07] message not the healing service the
[1:06:10] message that follows and they said that
[1:06:12] twice the message that follows the
[1:06:16] healing service that all right so in
[1:06:20] other words he did his first part from
[1:06:23] 47 to 63 he did his first party through
[1:06:26] the healing campaign he was getting the
[1:06:28] people's attention God was trying to
[1:06:30] tell the people listen the difference in
[1:06:33] William Branham and all those other
[1:06:35] great ones that he talked about they
[1:06:37] didn't have a vindicated message behind
[1:06:40] them there was nothing wrong with all
[1:06:43] robbers there was nothing wrong with
[1:06:45] well he had a message behind him because
[1:06:47] he was in the Bible but you take all the
[1:06:48] other ones dallying and moody and all
[1:06:51] them they were great powerful men and
[1:06:53] there was a lot of healings went on but
[1:06:54] they didn't have a vindicated message
[1:06:57] out of the Bible they said you're the
[1:06:59] one that's going to bring us to this
[1:07:01] spot so that's what we have we have that
[1:07:07] message that God gives a one man to
[1:07:11] bring to a group of people and not for
[1:07:14] us to just throw it under the under the
[1:07:17] seat
[1:07:25] the message that follows remember
[1:07:29] brother Brown said that was the healing
[1:07:30] was always the bein on the hook
[1:07:32] well what was he trying to catch the
[1:07:35] bait of the hook the bait was the
[1:07:38] healing service the hook was the message
[1:07:40] he was trying to get two people to take
[1:07:43] the message and they didn't to listen
[1:07:47] they did to a point I'm not belittling
[1:07:49] no one at all you know that but they're
[1:07:52] dead and gone they can't help us anymore
[1:07:54] lot of people why seek either living
[1:07:59] among the dead that's what the angel
[1:08:02] told him into cemetary they walked out
[1:08:05] so we're looking for Jesus's body and
[1:08:07] that angel said why are you seeking to
[1:08:08] live in the money bed that's the same
[1:08:11] way with you and I why are we seeking
[1:08:13] the living among the dead
[1:08:15] this message is life it will change your
[1:08:19] body but not in the years of preparation
[1:08:25] will it change your body it takes that
[1:08:29] place we are a that Plus people we are
[1:08:34] that plus we are that plus didn't bring
[1:08:39] the bamse we were headstone people well
[1:08:41] then there's this the headstone no
[1:08:43] that's the headstone we're heads don't
[1:08:45] people pray for a revelation but it's
[1:08:50] the message that follows the healing
[1:08:52] service so brother Branham comes at the
[1:08:54] end of what Pentecost again comes
[1:08:58] remember no mention to the aged
[1:09:00] Pentecost had the Holy Ghost right he
[1:09:03] comes at the end and brings his message
[1:09:04] and then brings his message right over
[1:09:06] into what there's not another eight
[1:09:08] search age so what is this message this
[1:09:12] message is the Eternity brought into
[1:09:16] time like brother Dale said the seven
[1:09:20] seals were not preached in one week the
[1:09:24] revelation of those seals went from 63
[1:09:26] to 65 to 2004 to 2014 to 2017 how you
[1:09:32] gonna stop an eternal word
[1:09:35] you cannot stop it no what what
[1:09:38] Laodicean Church age I just want you to
[1:09:42] see in this foundation the position
[1:09:44] you're at I'm talking to you I'm not
[1:09:46] talking to nobody else talking to you I
[1:09:51] like to give you a quotation of what
[1:09:54] this angel beast fits and tell you
[1:09:55] exactly what this angels gonna be would
[1:09:58] it be alright congregation says amen
[1:10:00] being that we got a little time I just
[1:10:02] wrote a little quotation here what I
[1:10:04] thought the angel of this layout of sin
[1:10:05] Church age to end it up now he will be
[1:10:08] at the end of the age now look he
[1:10:11] couldn't come at the end allowed us
[1:10:13] there he came at the end of the
[1:10:15] Pentecostal age to bring his message his
[1:10:18] first part goes to the church who'da
[1:10:24] preached in church he didn't come up
[1:10:28] till about the end about when he started
[1:10:30] preaching the seals and saying now call
[1:10:32] you bride he will be at the end of the
[1:10:36] age like the rest of them like the Bible
[1:10:39] he'd be at the end of the age not the
[1:10:41] first of it at the end of it because the
[1:10:44] angel always comes to rebuke for them
[1:10:47] what they done to the angel the church
[1:10:49] allowed to see his write these things to
[1:10:51] the angel Church Smyrna write these
[1:10:52] things we've been through this preach
[1:10:53] meantime see each one is to the angel at
[1:10:56] the end of the age Paul the end of the
[1:10:58] age and on down into the age the lap
[1:11:00] over the end of the age into the age
[1:11:02] that's what makes it lap like this this
[1:11:05] laps over here to the angel to the end
[1:11:07] of that agency picking up right here and
[1:11:09] made the lap like stair steps going up
[1:11:11] seven Church ages that cleat actually
[1:11:13] this is the way the church ages should
[1:11:14] be drawn because here's here's where the
[1:11:19] porter comes in here's where the lap
[1:11:20] over is it's where the messenger comes
[1:11:23] in because God doesn't abruptly stop you
[1:11:25] know what he doesn't because of me and
[1:11:26] you it is for us not him it's for us he
[1:11:31] brings grace enough that's why I said
[1:11:34] many times that he brought grace to
[1:11:36] those Pentecostal people up to a point
[1:11:37] brothers and sisters but I'm gonna tell
[1:11:39] you something he don't wink at your
[1:11:41] ignorance all the time hey man 1977 I
[1:11:46] believe he quit winking at the
[1:11:47] Pentecostal ignorance
[1:11:49] because this message came you sure he
[1:11:51] was off the scene hold on I got a quote
[1:11:54] let me read it to you that alright can I
[1:11:58] read it
[1:11:59] number 11 I'm gonna read you two
[1:12:02] excellent
[1:12:03] now notice quickly now she is at that
[1:12:05] stage this is birth pains that's why I
[1:12:07] told them downstairs we'd be talking
[1:12:08] about bringing a breech birth I went
[1:12:10] back read birth plans and I believe I
[1:12:12] ever read that book before they must
[1:12:15] have printed a new one cuz I read that
[1:12:17] book 100 times sister Jeannie and I read
[1:12:19] it again and it's like I've never read
[1:12:20] it before but you know what I read it
[1:12:22] with the mentality that we are in that
[1:12:24] breech we were that birth but watch I'm
[1:12:28] gonna let him confirming not me she is
[1:12:29] that that stage beyond - our doubt were
[1:12:31] in the Laodicean Church age so he tells
[1:12:33] us right where we are
[1:12:34] now her messenger is promised in my
[1:12:37] LaCava fourth chapter he's promised to
[1:12:39] do it now this is 1965 after the seal
[1:12:43] the message is to bring back the word
[1:12:46] bring the people back to the word birth
[1:12:49] is to be she's to be delivered of a new
[1:12:52] birth from according to Malachi 4 so
[1:12:55] Malachi 4 did not bring us a new new
[1:12:58] birth still justification still
[1:13:01] sanctification is still about - the Holy
[1:13:03] Ghost the Word of God but it was coming
[1:13:06] under our messenger that birth was
[1:13:09] coming under a messenger where we're
[1:13:12] able to one receive more we're beaten to
[1:13:16] be delivered of a new birth from
[1:13:18] according to Malachi 4 look in the
[1:13:21] church world today there's two systems
[1:13:23] working I think this is where I cut some
[1:13:26] of this out he was you read birth plans
[1:13:28] and I promise you you'll see what I was
[1:13:31] talking about in the church today
[1:13:33] there's two systems are working now
[1:13:34] listen real close now I want to see if
[1:13:36] you're going to say Amen on this there's
[1:13:38] two systems working in the church world
[1:13:40] today I'm going to get this off my
[1:13:42] shoulder and then I have it over with we
[1:13:45] all know that that's the Word of God and
[1:13:47] the denominational system there is the
[1:13:51] two systems at work just as they was
[1:13:54] Jacob and Esau one after the spirit the
[1:13:57] other one after the flesh and what is it
[1:13:59] Esau and Jacob was fighting in the womb
[1:14:02] of
[1:14:02] the mother even to the time they were
[1:14:05] born and so is the denominational and
[1:14:08] the word fighting one against the other
[1:14:12] they have been since Luther first
[1:14:15] brought the first Reformation so this is
[1:14:18] not new I hope that simple enough that
[1:14:21] you can understand it now I like this
[1:14:23] part
[1:14:24] these men if they pick up this listen
[1:14:27] Louis if they pick up this and go out
[1:14:30] with it they can make more sense of it
[1:14:33] see to bring it to a place you would I
[1:14:36] just want to lay this seed that hope
[1:14:38] they make it come to life
[1:14:41] I believe I'm in that sentence right
[1:14:43] there number 12 birth pains 1965 it's
[1:14:54] always been there that's the reason
[1:14:56] she's bearing birth pains because there
[1:14:58] there's a fight in her there's an East
[1:15:02] Hall just a man of the world very
[1:15:04] religious and oh he's alright good fella
[1:15:07] clean moral as far as I know of but he
[1:15:11] don't know nothing about that birthright
[1:15:13] he's born that way he's shaped that way
[1:15:16] and Jacob I don't care what he is he
[1:15:20] wants that birthright
[1:15:21] he's the spiritual one listen now and
[1:15:24] them too today is in the womb of the
[1:15:26] church there's a great big system trying
[1:15:31] to be formed called the World Council of
[1:15:33] Churches and from the womb of the church
[1:15:36] is coming forth to children you just
[1:15:38] mark my word the world's the word must
[1:15:42] deliver the word bride church the church
[1:15:46] has got to be delivered out of her a
[1:15:49] bride for Christ then that fell asleep
[1:15:53] in all ages look we'll make up the bride
[1:15:56] that come out on the world that they
[1:15:57] come out on like from your feet coming
[1:16:00] to your head she gets gets greater and
[1:16:03] more you have to have so we gotta have
[1:16:07] more as the body grows up so does the
[1:16:13] body of Christ girl
[1:16:14] and then finally the head will come to
[1:16:18] it the head of it will now we notice
[1:16:21] because it's all weight to the head the
[1:16:25] head does the turning are the pulling
[1:16:27] all right now one morning well then
[1:16:29] we'll make a few comments and then we'll
[1:16:31] have communion adoption 1960 tell me my
[1:16:34] brother tell me my sister when was the
[1:16:36] time that the sons of God was ever to be
[1:16:39] manifested outside of this time now when
[1:16:43] were there ever a time in the history
[1:16:45] that man manifests the time to deliver
[1:16:48] all nature nature the nature itself is
[1:16:52] groaning waiting for the time of the
[1:16:54] manifestation while before the atonement
[1:16:56] was made before the Holy Ghost was ever
[1:16:59] poured out before although all the Old
[1:17:01] Testament on down there that couldn't
[1:17:03] have been manifestation it had to wait
[1:17:07] till this time now all things has been
[1:17:10] brought coming shaping up to a headstone
[1:17:13] to the manifestation of sons of God
[1:17:16] coming back now look he's in the
[1:17:18] headstone to the manifestation of sons
[1:17:23] of God coming back and the Spirit of God
[1:17:25] coming into these men men so perfectly
[1:17:32] until their ministry will be so close
[1:17:34] like Christ to join him in his church
[1:17:37] together amen
[1:17:40] I believe that our problem is
[1:17:52] improper teaching I mean how can you set
[1:18:00] in a message church for 30 years and say
[1:18:05] that the seals with just the opening of
[1:18:07] the horse riders and I just can't see
[1:18:11] that because we've been well talked and
[1:18:16] I don't feel I don't feel no greater it
[1:18:19] actually makes you feel worse that all
[1:18:21] this time that people's had to - hey
[1:18:25] listen did I not read your quotes today
[1:18:27] did I read your quotes from out in space
[1:18:31] somewhere look those are quotes that are
[1:18:34] common in the prophets message right
[1:18:37] common it's not something that I had to
[1:18:39] read different than you've ever read
[1:18:40] like birth pains I've never read that
[1:18:43] book before I don't know where that book
[1:18:45] came from I just read it with more
[1:18:48] understanding hey man because remember
[1:18:51] brother branham I believe he preached a
[1:18:53] message in that days one thing for sure
[1:18:55] he preached at different levels because
[1:18:57] there was denominational people there
[1:18:59] they was people that was not getting
[1:19:01] anything at all just like here there's
[1:19:04] three times three kinds of people in the
[1:19:06] church to make believe we're nothing
[1:19:07] believer a true believer
[1:19:08] you gotta preach to all of them amen
[1:19:10] listen if you've ever prayed for your
[1:19:13] family pray for them now if you've ever
[1:19:15] prayed for your loved ones pray for them
[1:19:17] now because look the foolish virgin
[1:19:20] remember didn't have time they knew
[1:19:24] where the oil was they went to the wise
[1:19:28] virgins and said give us of your oil
[1:19:30] they knew weren't with that that in
[1:19:32] other words they knew where the word was
[1:19:36] but what did they tell them we don't
[1:19:39] have in other words let me put it let me
[1:19:40] paraphrase oh we don't have enough time
[1:19:42] to get you to the place you need to be
[1:19:44] yeah go find your own that sounds
[1:19:48] horrible but listen I don't know if you
[1:19:50] gonna make it but I know yeah but I know
[1:19:56] I'm gonna make it
[1:19:58] yeah okay so be careful we've got to
[1:20:05] come to a place though that we've never
[1:20:06] come before we've never walked this way
[1:20:09] before we have never come to a place
[1:20:13] where our mentality has got to be
[1:20:15] totally different even Satan in a
[1:20:19] message congregation we were sitting one
[1:20:21] day that was six hundred people in the
[1:20:22] church right at least six hundred people
[1:20:26] and this guy this well-known preacher
[1:20:29] that all we all listened to on one from
[1:20:31] up north he's preaching away just to
[1:20:36] worse doctor and I ever heard that Jesus
[1:20:40] went and gone to the river Jordan we
[1:20:41] heard that and then we hear this other
[1:20:45] well-known preacher that some of you
[1:20:47] listen to online that said that he Adam
[1:20:51] had to place his liberal seat into Eve
[1:20:52] the saber well that six hundred well
[1:20:54] know five hundred and eighty five people
[1:20:57] got on their feet and screamed
[1:20:59] hallelujah praise God jumping all over
[1:21:02] the place that was fifteen of us there
[1:21:04] we didn't get up we didn't clap our
[1:21:07] hands you say well y'all just know you
[1:21:09] know what I'm gonna tell you something
[1:21:11] we're gonna find out who's right and
[1:21:13] who's wrong if I'm wrong you'll know it
[1:21:18] if I'm right you're gonna know it all
[1:21:20] right Paul walked up one day and he said
[1:21:23] you will be judged by what I say now I
[1:21:28] know Paul was a prophet and you're not
[1:21:30] gonna be just what I say cuz without in
[1:21:31] other words he got it straight from God
[1:21:34] we should get it straight from God but
[1:21:37] we have to have a little help we have to
[1:21:39] have a prophet Paul was a profit goes
[1:21:41] remember profit only answers to God
[1:21:43] profit I don't see how these people in
[1:21:45] the message are saying they're above
[1:21:47] brother Branham how he's wrong here and
[1:21:49] he's wrong here and he's wrong here they
[1:21:50] must be closer to God than brother Adam
[1:21:52] boy cuz it's brother Branham in God
[1:21:55] folks and I'm sorry nothing in between
[1:21:58] now he turns and gives it to us and
[1:22:01] we're supposed to teach it right but
[1:22:04] there's nobody between the profiting God
[1:22:06] if if brother Branham needed correction
[1:22:08] God corrected him
[1:22:10] and that's it period if God had to
[1:22:15] correct him it mean if he needed
[1:22:16] correction God corrected him and listen
[1:22:19] I asked to know how much Antichrist can
[1:22:22] you be because Satan is created by this
[1:22:26] great man called God but yet ething
[1:22:29] seeking beat him
[1:22:30] look how deceived he is he deceived part
[1:22:33] of the angels to believe his plan that
[1:22:35] he being a created being can whip a
[1:22:39] creator that created him out of nothing
[1:22:43] you see our deceiving that is that's the
[1:22:46] same spirit now it's the same devil like
[1:22:52] we told him in Jamaica it's the same
[1:22:54] devil just got different names from
[1:22:55] there to here right but you and I must
[1:23:00] come to a place to realize and I want us
[1:23:02] to understand one thing if you think you
[1:23:04] better than somebody else Jesus never
[1:23:08] thought he was better than somebody else
[1:23:10] so that put that put you out of here
[1:23:12] yeah that's why we must be serviced
[1:23:16] that's why I like what brother Claude
[1:23:18] said he said look Rock there's for
[1:23:19] brotherly kindness is supposed to be
[1:23:21] right before the headstone comes because
[1:23:24] you know what brother branham they said
[1:23:26] he didn't you couldn't tell who his
[1:23:27] enemies or his friends were now listen
[1:23:29] I'll promise you one thing give me a few
[1:23:31] minutes with you and I can tell you who
[1:23:33] your enemies are because you'll tell me
[1:23:36] somewhere down the line and I'll tell
[1:23:38] you the same thing
[1:23:39] so I'm telling you it brotherly kindness
[1:23:40] right there is where that headstone come
[1:23:43] down and Father forgive them for they
[1:23:45] know not what they do have we ever said
[1:23:48] that when somebody persecute us or
[1:23:50] somebody bring something wrong against
[1:23:52] us says God forgive them they don't know
[1:23:56] what they're doing they're spiritually
[1:23:58] blind and spiritual blindness is way
[1:24:02] worse than natural blindness amen
[1:24:05] because you know what spiritual
[1:24:07] blindness you don't know you're blind
[1:24:09] poor wretched miserable blind and don't
[1:24:12] know it so we've come to that place here
[1:24:15] that we see now just recap the rest of
[1:24:18] this and then we'll we'll have communion
[1:24:20] we see that there was a message that
[1:24:22] brother Brown
[1:24:23] a message but at the end of the age at
[1:24:25] the end of this Laodicean age there was
[1:24:28] a message brought that was not different
[1:24:31] but it is different right
[1:24:35] same message but more of it amen
[1:24:40] not a different Bible brother branham
[1:24:41] this will be something outside nope this
[1:24:46] will be something so nope
[1:24:48] wouldn't it be no he just stops them
[1:24:51] right there it's gotta be right here
[1:24:54] everything the headstone like brother
[1:24:57] that's your word the word the word must
[1:25:00] come back in power like it was when
[1:25:03] Jesus was here because remember the
[1:25:06] voice of the resurrection was in Jesus
[1:25:10] I'm not looking for a rapture I'm
[1:25:13] telling you again I'm not looking for
[1:25:14] one it's going to happen but it will
[1:25:18] never happen till the dead come out of
[1:25:21] the ground or the Bible is not right the
[1:25:25] Bible says we which are alive and remain
[1:25:27] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:25:29] what prevent or hinder those which are
[1:25:31] asleep for the trumpet of god shall
[1:25:34] sound the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:25:37] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:25:41] will be caught up see there so the
[1:25:42] rapture the rapture is something waiting
[1:25:44] over there we got to get the dead out of
[1:25:47] the ground we got to know that death is
[1:25:49] destroyed you think that bothered him
[1:25:52] death didn't bother Jesus sure the
[1:25:56] natural body cried out but he knew his
[1:25:58] job you and I must know our job is to
[1:26:01] get a group of people up in to the
[1:26:03] headstone so that we can see not that we
[1:26:06] can teach you anything I want you to get
[1:26:07] that out of your head but remember that
[1:26:11] scripture I read you in Corinthians that
[1:26:14] you will search for the spirit searches
[1:26:17] all things yay the deep things of God
[1:26:23] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:26:25] save the spirit of Man which is in him
[1:26:30] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:26:33] but the Spirit of God you can't
[1:26:35] understand without God being inside
[1:26:37] you can't understand when we come you
[1:26:40] can brother Brahim said what the first
[1:26:42] pull imitate second pole can be imitated
[1:26:45] right but the third pole cannot be
[1:26:48] imitated
[1:26:48] that's the third pole remember I read
[1:26:50] you the quote I cut it out to this but
[1:26:53] last Sunday he said realize this is that
[1:26:55] third pole this is the third pole this
[1:26:59] is the first and second pole this was
[1:27:01] getting the people to see the message
[1:27:02] that was coming not the healing campaign
[1:27:06] but at the end of his message with what
[1:27:09] when he begins to sound his message the
[1:27:13] mystery of God will be finished but it
[1:27:18] will take a group of people to carry
[1:27:20] this on brother I'm sitting men that'll
[1:27:22] take this message and sweep it on to the
[1:27:24] coming of the Lord so that's our job
[1:27:27] without it you and I brother branham
[1:27:30] came in vain if somebody doesn't stand
[1:27:33] one day and say well I was gonna say
[1:27:39] this Ruth Kali come out of the ground
[1:27:42] Robert Tatum come out of the ground
[1:27:44] Garry we want you here brother Marlo you
[1:27:50] know what they're that far away that far
[1:27:55] away that far that far you know what it
[1:28:03] just takes us believing what's all ready
[1:28:05] here let's stand to our feet it's
[1:28:08] already here it's just gotta be broke so
[1:28:12] that we can what see or understand open
[1:28:18] the eyes of my heart Lord let me what
[1:28:20] see you let me see not what's coming
[1:28:24] what's already here brother Brown said
[1:28:30] I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying
[1:28:32] he's here then he is the one that's
[1:28:35] gonna hey you and I were in that man
[1:28:41] called Jesus right and when he said
[1:28:43] Lazarus come forth
[1:28:49] when he said Lazarus come forth that's
[1:28:54] right if he'd have said burn Bromstad if
[1:28:55] he would have said everything everybody
[1:28:57] come forth he would but you know what he
[1:28:59] wasn't to fulfill that you and I were to
[1:29:03] fulfill that he wasn't to fulfill all
[1:29:07] come out of the ground
[1:29:08] he brought Lazarus out of the ground but
[1:29:10] you know what when we bring the dead out
[1:29:12] of the ground they're not going back in
[1:29:14] the ground we're not going down we're
[1:29:17] going up hey man let's bow our head
[1:29:22] definitely Father we pray Lord it
[1:29:24] what says been pleasing to You Lord may
[1:29:28] not be pleasing sometimes this old flesh
[1:29:30] but Lord may we chew on these words and
[1:29:33] realize one thing for sure if we don't
[1:29:37] come to a place then your prophet came
[1:29:40] and preached all them years for nothing
[1:29:42] but we know that your word will not
[1:29:46] return void that it will accomplish
[1:29:49] everything that it said it would
[1:29:51] accomplish so now as we stand here as
[1:29:54] the alive living bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29:57] we are that we which are alive and
[1:30:00] remain right now we are preventing and
[1:30:04] hindering from those coming out of the
[1:30:07] ground but Lord not very far from now
[1:30:11] we're gonna see our loved ones again
[1:30:13] we're gonna see the one just went on and
[1:30:15] we're gonna have a time all won't it be
[1:30:18] a time brother jewel that he's talking
[1:30:21] with the Angels I want I really don't
[1:30:23] want to talk to the angel I want to talk
[1:30:25] to the people I know that have went to
[1:30:27] that other side Lord that your prophet
[1:30:30] saw and his brother Dale was talking
[1:30:32] this morning about God having been so
[1:30:34] real in the garden being a spirit he
[1:30:37] could still tear the skins well when the
[1:30:39] prophet went across the curtain of time
[1:30:40] he stood there and he said I could feel
[1:30:43] those people they were solid they had
[1:30:46] feelings so that's what kind of body
[1:30:48] that we're looking at we're not looking
[1:30:50] at some spook or some fake something
[1:30:53] Lord we're looking at a reality we're
[1:30:55] looking that that's been hitting the
[1:30:57] word and God I believe now in this time
[1:31:00] right now today that we will be able to
[1:31:03] see more of what you're doing not what
[1:31:07] you're gonna do show us today there's
[1:31:10] enough power in this room to create a
[1:31:12] whole universe but we're held by what a
[1:31:16] bar and a lot of it is our unbelief
[1:31:21] and I pray father that you would break
[1:31:24] that break that steel of unbelief
[1:31:26] I don't believe had you had any
[1:31:28] hesitation to come out of that tomb that
[1:31:31] morning on Easter morning I don't
[1:31:33] believe you hesitated one bit father I
[1:31:35] believe you came right into that body
[1:31:36] walked out stepped right out of that
[1:31:38] grave and said all power and heaven and
[1:31:41] earth being given unto me well Lord if
[1:31:43] it's been given unto you then it's been
[1:31:45] given to us to carry on this great
[1:31:47] Ministry of Jesus Christ Father forgive
[1:31:50] us of our sins and our mistakes that we
[1:31:52] make be with us now Lord and the further
[1:31:54] man the services would take communion
[1:31:55] may we remember Lord the last thing you
[1:31:58] told us to do before you left and that
[1:32:01] was to take the communion to commune
[1:32:03] with You Father but also to commune with
[1:32:05] each other to bring us closer Lord to
[1:32:08] You Father we pray these things in the
[1:32:11] lovely name of Jesus Christ amen let's
[1:32:14] go into the community anybody have a
[1:32:16] need we'll pray for you but I want you
[1:32:19] to believe in your seats
[1:32:20] that's the Gentile way laying on of
[1:32:25] hands is still in the Bible but it's not
[1:32:29] the way it's supposed to be brother
[1:32:32] Branham says it was a tradition that
[1:32:35] John Wesley started so I don't like
[1:32:39] traditions out for that too much I want
[1:32:41] to just believe believe were you sitting
[1:32:45] if you need to have a connection that's
[1:32:48] okay but I believe that was a Centurion
[1:32:51] one time looked right straight at Jesus
[1:32:53] and he said you are a man of authority
[1:32:56] and I'm a man of authority whatever you
[1:33:00] you know I say you know ten thousand go
[1:33:03] over here or one hundred go over here
[1:33:04] and they go you know what he was saying
[1:33:06] he was saying I know you are in a man of
[1:33:09] authority and whatever you say whatever
[1:33:12] demon that
[1:33:13] is that's taking over that servant of
[1:33:15] mine whatever you say that's what'll
[1:33:17] happen Jesus said I don't even need to
[1:33:21] go in your house I mean whatever
[1:33:24] distance it was it didn't make no
[1:33:25] difference because the person came
[1:33:28] running back and said well what time he
[1:33:29] said well about 11:30
[1:33:31] he saw us about the time Jesus said that
[1:33:34] I said about 11:30 the man got better as
[1:33:37] a long arm reaching out but he didn't
[1:33:39] need it he just needed faith to believe
[1:33:41] that Jesus was a man of authority that's
[1:33:44] what he believed so let's go into the
[1:33:46] community Lord bless you till next
[1:33:48] Sunday take care yourself love the Lord
[1:33:51] love each other we're a special group of
[1:33:56] people don't forget that amen to the
[1:34:07] word you know you think about the closer
[1:34:17] we're getting to the rapture change the
[1:34:20] resurrection of things we did not mean
[1:34:24] that that's the closer we're getting to
[1:34:29] those that have gone on any problem that
[1:34:36] thought you or tinnitus ate it because
[1:34:39] you know won't say something else
[1:34:42] what about then if we're the prophets
[1:34:45] somewhere in the 50s 60s he said those
[1:34:49] people are destined to 20 feet away
[1:34:53] it'll slant well what that means I don't
[1:34:58] know but I don't worry about it
[1:34:59] but you know if you ever thought about
[1:35:00] that when you raised your hands up and
[1:35:04] you wave them to God they might be close
[1:35:09] enough to hold hands with
[1:35:15] you saw that's just crap well okay I'm
[1:35:18] just crazy the closer they're getting
[1:35:22] then maybe we could contact them a
[1:35:25] little more it might mean they just move
[1:35:28] right among this one dinner I thought
[1:35:31] that was what we believed and was
[1:35:34] waiting for that's why we got the
[1:35:37] pictures down stars to where we don't
[1:35:39] have no problems when they're raised to
[1:35:41] see how a young looking person will be
[1:35:48] so remember you might have raised your
[1:35:50] hand a little bit more you know if you
[1:35:53] enjoyed the message and make sure you
[1:35:55] tell my brother he enjoys the Lord for
[1:36:00] the word let's go right on into the
[1:36:03] communion first Corinthians 11 for I've
[1:36:07] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:36:10] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:36:11] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:36:13] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:36:16] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:36:19] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:36:21] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:36:23] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:36:26] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:36:29] my blood this do ye ye as often as you
[1:36:34] drink often oft as you drink it in
[1:36:37] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:36:41] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:36:43] shew the Lord's death till he comes or
[1:36:45] for whosoever shall eat this bread and
[1:36:47] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:36:49] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:36:52] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[1:36:54] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:36:55] drink of that Cup for he that eateth and
[1:36:58] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:36:59] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:37:02] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:37:05] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:37:09] we would judge our if our if we judge
[1:37:13] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:37:16] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:37:18] the Lord then we should not be condemned
[1:37:20] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:37:22] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:37:25] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:37:27] him eat at home
[1:37:28] did you come not together under
[1:37:30] condemnation arrest what I said in order
[1:37:33] when I come let's just have a moment of
[1:37:36] silent prayer and just praying one for
[1:37:39] the other and praying the Lord with
[1:37:40] leaders and goddess
[1:37:55] father we thank you for the word that we
[1:37:57] heard today and we pray that you just
[1:37:59] bless us with understanding of you that
[1:38:02] your light would shine in our hearts and
[1:38:04] life as we go into now to the further
[1:38:06] minute of their service and taken to the
[1:38:08] communion we thank you Lord for your
[1:38:11] grace and your loving to each and every
[1:38:13] one of us cleanse us and make us worthy
[1:38:15] to partake of this communion we love you
[1:38:18] we thank you in Jesus name father we
[1:38:30] thank you for this bread is made and we
[1:38:33] ask you to just let it be in order to
[1:38:36] understand it from that bit we know it's
[1:38:39] not your blood or body that we're
[1:38:41] protecting of this day we know it is in
[1:38:44] representation we thank you we ask you
[1:38:47] to sanctify the bread and the partakers
[1:38:49] in Jesus name
[1:39:02] you know we we don't think too much
[1:39:06] about life and realities from time uShip
[1:39:10] but more to think about who we are what
[1:39:16] we here for
[1:39:18] we're here for a purpose to end all this
[1:39:21] up it's been children our lot to finish
[1:39:26] this bring everything to a conclusion
[1:39:29] and the brain fourth we did the comb
[1:39:33] that's left up to us they without us
[1:39:36] could not be made perfect and then
[1:39:38] they're waiting for that you know is
[1:39:40] that saying we might think it odd to
[1:39:43] think that we can reach out and touch
[1:39:45] someone
[1:39:46] well I don't have to worry about that
[1:39:49] too much I seem like I heard a prophet
[1:39:52] one day saying that he was standing and
[1:39:56] somebody reached over and put her hand
[1:39:58] on his shoulder maybe we could be a
[1:40:03] little closer than we think
[1:40:05] right say well if we can't do this we
[1:40:09] can't do that if we get our mind out of
[1:40:14] heavenly places to thank sensibly about
[1:40:17] the word we might find out this is
[1:40:24] closer than we think
[1:40:29] father we thank you for this wine has
[1:40:31] been made and purpose to represent your
[1:40:34] blood father we ask you to do is just
[1:40:37] strength upon it as we eat the little
[1:40:40] piece of bread and drink a little wine
[1:40:42] Lord tomorrow and be blood cells in our
[1:40:45] bodies we'll be able to live off of it
[1:40:48] we thank you thank you for the truth of
[1:40:51] knowing all what you've given unto each
[1:40:53] one of us sanctify the wine and the
[1:40:56] protector in Jesus name come morning
[1:41:09] walk by the river ah
[1:41:15] [Music]
