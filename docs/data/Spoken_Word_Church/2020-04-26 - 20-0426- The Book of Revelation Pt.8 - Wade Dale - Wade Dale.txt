TRANSCRIPT
========================================
no hmm gonna be here today couldn't have another Sunday doesn't have any Janet wanting to here with us yeah looking for a good day in the Lord we we got some good wonderful weather outside the sun's out the signs up and here Bob still cultivate what Bob said Wednesday not letting it plant that seed let you have cultivated you gotta get you that's right you gotta get you a little shovel a running start get weeds up you tell us Gardens these all right so we were in Revelation chapter 3 and we're we went through Martin Luther's time John Wesley's time and now we're getting into the layout of Stanton church age we've talked about this last Sonny behold I come quickly hold fast that which now past that no man take my crown and one of give me I've been reading in that against Genesis Exodus Leviticus Deuteronomy and it brought back to my memory that you see what it says hold fast which thou hath and then you're going up here a little bit further says you got a name that you called but you didn't you got all these different things that but God said I'll not forget you you know him that overcometh won't make a pillar temple monk another words what I'm saying is mm-hmm Martin Luther John Wesley and the Pentecostal age all had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for their time but it was not like what we getting that's the same Holy Ghost but Martin Luther was the just shall live by faith yet he did all these other things that wasn't excuse me not pleasing to God God's not pleased with the Trinitarian doctrine but he does allow that and weakened their ignorance because Martin Luther had one message each one of these have one message Martin Luther just reeling buffet mark I mean John Wesley sanctification live right have a method of worship have a method of church that's one that collect Methodist because this a method and like I said before if you ever in a Methodist Church look at their songbook the whole front of it tells you exact and they do if you go to an old-fashioned Methodist Church like the white church up there the white building church up there and guiltily on the side for we've to live there Midway you go in and it's just you but that was what God was pleased because that brought back into instead of just coming in and talking in yeah kidding and as they did down in these other ages it's come in have communion that meant just eating drinking and all that stuff well there was a form of worship came back into into being so holdfast what you have I was thinking about this and and I started reading it out it is wonderful that we got a prophet but you'll go back in the Old Testament and you'll see that there was two tribes and a half tribe I believe it was Reuben GAD and half tribe of Manasses now remember what was the promised land Canaan was the promised land so here's I was going to show you this this is kind of the real animal dish God give us all this and sent the message you've gotten it this is the promised land this is Canaan see in Cana our promised land all right then you got the Jordan River all right then over here you've got these were the other lands they come up from Egypt into here and God told them the gold ran to the promised land now we know the promised lands are baptism of the Holy Ghost don't break up that but there are degrees that each person gets of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you you are the one that by your free moral agency you decide when you want to go further with because God's happy and they were happy but you had two tribes and a half drive this thing we would like to have our possession over here the other nine and a half drive went over we're in the promised land with Hood Joshua being a cop of the Holy Ghost right right her Christ job saving some ninety I hope everybody got that that's really neat vision he was a son he had no father on earth so Jesus Christ had no father now we know that Heavenly Father but Joshua was the son of nun he was the son so I have to be in a type of Christ Christ expanding say I I don't have a father bounty of my father's up you know in heaven I'm just a little not a playable words God put them in there for some reason yeah maybe for us to see that so you've got your two and a half tribes Reuben GAD and half tribal of an asset but now what did Joshua tell them to do Joshua will see you can have this don't remember Joshua was commissioned to place them in the land Moses brought them to right here then Joshua was wanted took them over into the Promised Land what is the Promised Land to me the Promised Land for now today is not just the baptism in the Holy Ghost but the full promised land body spirit so nobody got that right but now these were happy enough Reuben Gavin have traveled my Nessman Isis they they were okay but now what did Joshua say Joshua said okay you can have this land I'm gonna make it a point you you can have this land but you're gonna have to go over Jordan into the Promised Land help us fight yeah but you're placing is going to be by a hair yeah they're gonna we're gonna fight as twelve tribes you're gonna help us clean this land of all these i'ts so Joshua can positionally place these now these have already been positionally placed not making them any less right because they all went over and fought and all of a sudden when they got all the and Joshua which is a type of adoption where you get this and placing and you get this and you get you get a judgment coming faith virtue knowledge implication when you get in this land so these two and a half tribes went back to cross Jordan and occupied it not out of the full promised land that they got the promise to go across but they come back and same time brother Branham gave us some wonderful type of that being being Luther Wesley and Pentecost man you said what's the difference the difference is is they didn't go all the way they had so much hold fast which thou hast they went across and got and tight the Holy Ghost in the promised land but instead of going on and being placed in the promised land they decided they decided to come back out here and we'll find a peaceful here yeah but then wearing the promised land you say well how that helping mate Luther Wesley enter and Pentecost got the baptism the Holy Ghost but they didn't get full adoption they didn't get the full plan of redemption to go on with God in the promised land and what have rest be settled them right they come back out here rule them again half travel Manassas typing brother Brown said thank God for a prophet who would you do whatever say that right but then you look at brother brown when you say oh that's that's uh that time its justification st. and baptism of the holy go okay not saying they didn't get your Carter they got a portion they even went across in the promised land they got the whole ego but they didn't go on with God same thing with Luther little bit got the baptism I Holy Ghost but he what he comes back out in denominations we're going to see that today in Ruth because Orpha cotton denominational Church she went so far with with Naomi but she went right back into where she from back in the bowl at brother I'm tell listen many times the tactics the phenomena Church they didn't go on the gun they didn't go on with Naomi to get into the promised land they went so hard any went back now they did these dick over in pumps land they got something but they didn't get a land possession right this land they got a promise okay but they didn't get the full prompt they come back out as lucre steps into the baptism of the holy ghost but he turns and tries to bring some of the Catholic ideas doctrines with him which is not the promised land not the full promised land same way we with Martin Luther same way with John Wesley he comes out of whatever reform that is in Martin Luther's age and he said that's okay but there's more yes and then God tells him hold fast what you got what you got okay what behalf he went into the Promised Land that's just that sanctification you got the baptism of the Holy go but he comes back out and he's still got Trinitarian doctrine he still got water baptism name father-son photo he's still hanging on to a lot of these things at work that's not even his promptly nobody got that same thing with same thing with the hash table which is Pentecost went over the promised land bought the land fall with the people but what they did tones is the evidence they had right back out to the outside don't get the full promise they got the whole ego just like you got the whole ego but I only ghost tells us by the prophet and bottle message of the hour and even Bible Bible the clarity of the Bible that it's not just speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not just that you do this it's whether you agree with the word and the word try today it's full possession placing right all right we get into the placing we should not we can't bring I'm telling you this we can't bring those old doctrines back across the river with us and we can't go back because we've already been took in the promised land by a prophet right okay now most didn't basically take them in but Moses let me put it this way Moses doctrine was in Joshua yeah because God said as I was with Moses so I'll be with you so everything Moses died Joshua got Caleb being a cop of the believers so you got to you've got [Music] you've got I would come at the penguin so you've got all this happening out here so wanting brother brother brother brother come and say look here's where we need to be this is not all of our promised land yeah getting the baptism the Holy Ghost you Pentecostals that's good but let's go on let's go on the end of the promised land which is this land not to land this on the inside yes and look they were still the crimes of Israel they didn't lose anything but position okay they include they came over here saw Pentecost thought it out they talked about is when the whole goes for their day but what do they did they go back and grab the Trinitarian doctrine they go back and grab the father sent the Trinitarian idea wonder about all the things that the previous ones had God they went back out God so God is telling them hold fast that that you have that no man take your crown they're not gonna take your crown is just it they weren't Wesley was not predestinated Pentecost was not predestinate to take forward because you got a hand we're going to talk about today you've got your three works of grace which gives you the Holy Ghost just baptism the Holy Ghost but then what would rather have to bring in the word our adoption well no that's not on this side right of Jordan all this this adoption and all this placing took place on the other side of door yeah the property God gave us the word to take us a cross and then he left the scene just like Moses did yeah but who came on the scene Christ came on the scene in the bride of the day now today the fivefold ministry and the prophets message placing each person in their proper position in the land they're back out there so that's to me that's a beautiful picture so there's really only three works of grace because you can't take those fries now but you got a four for is restoration cuz for bug the four bugs that ate it gotta put everybody back this way the caterpillar think you are Tom Warren all look for eat the tree down from where from down here but brother Brad talks about a bride trees starting back so on this side you have to shoot you haven't stopped you got the tassel but the full grain is what went over in the full grant is what this was the promised land to begin with they got out of the Promised Land got out of the will of God we'll see the same thing with Naomi Naomi was in this Bethlehem Judea Promised Land she goes the mobile app which is way over here and Moab began by the son that was born from Daddy and a woman daddy and his daughter getting together and having a baby which was it's always been looked at brother Graham said the hair and the biscuit so you know you yeah anything he said which in this day in Thomas against the wall but back then I guess it had to be a time there had to be a type somewhere to show us that there had to be an orphan there had to be a Ruth there had to be a Naomi they had to be able ass so there's your four yes they only root or foe both aspect that gets everybody in there and then this type remember we're going to stick the devil in there too because he was a near kinsman because of this guy that's why he that's why they stayed over here on this side and didn't go all the way to the full restoration of the work which will come in the way out of C interphase because he promises right here at the beginning my starting until the Angel of the Church of the loudest and write these things that D Amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of God and the beginning of creation God began here but the who is the beginning of the creation have done the Lord Jesus Christ that was the beginning that should have been and they're not gonna fall it would have been no sex that would have been spoken were children just like Jesus was spoken into the womb of Mary that's the way that's the beginning of the creation of God you say well the God no that can't be created it's the beginning of the unfolding is there has to be a part in us there has to be a beginning of we are time creatures right God's not but he knows we are so we have to know that there's a time everything's got an order you start in the kindergarten then you go for first grade then you go to second grade well it's all building on education all the way up to go build you guys in college you're still building on what you learn back then the one plus one is two going to school on time saying yes ma'am no ma'am doing all the things that spoke you see when a man's child training so that's the way God knew we were going to grow up so that's the way he decided to grow up yes being in the womb that because remember that like we're talking the other day milk acetate was guarding human flesh but he wasn't our kinsman if we're gonna talk about today Boas had to be a close near kinsman to Naomi yes or he couldn't do the right of redemption he could not redeem what and because of the laws in the Old Testament thank god we've got these examples that we can look at in a profit that gives us clarity so in this trkage is the beginning of the creation of God starting with what the baptism of the Holy Ghost when one day of Pentecost 1906 Azusa Street the Holy Ghost came and was the messenger to that part of the age he's the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness nothing is false but when you get a tuning fork it's not wrong but when you hit it you get a true sound that's the same MO because you get a true witness the beginning of the creation of God you know one that says true witness now in Christ there's been a true witness the whole time but these people open vent over here in that has some denominational ideas that were contrary to God they weren't a true witness now they were a true witness in saying we're Christians we believe God died for our sins and all that but we wants you to be baptized man father son Holy Ghost cuz we believe there's a Trinitarian three persons to the Godhead that's not a true witness right so now we have a true witness we have the right tuning fork we have the right person on the scene we got the right messenger all right the beginning of the creation of God but now watch what happens being that that is so true God has got to do what he's got separated he didn't separate it over here he allowed them to have their ideas of Trinity of the all the things that are false now that we see that that the denominations have started didn't start back 200 years ago it started 2,000 years ago when God came on the scene in flesh and Satan came on the scene and here we over the dad denominational ideas back then he says I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would have to tell a cold or hot what you lukewarm you're you're out here you're saying you got all this and you really don't have it all you got some of it but you don't have all of it and I will spew thee out of my mouth because there are blue warm kasi they were on fire for God don't get me wrong in the three Church ages private here keep their pages but Glocks finally said I've had enough I want a true witness and this is the way I wanted it to begin with so I don't want you lukewarm I don't want you see this is lukewarm let me put an Aries on both sides flip-flopping in and out in and out no no this is God move forward wait all this behind if you guys about give them the Holy Ghost you gotta go on I'm going to require that now or I'm gonna spew you out of my mouth which he does was the denominational like the orifice of the world they head on back to the come on the church so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth so in other words I'm not going to deal with you now I'll give you enough word through all this coming of them of them of the Prophet and all these different things in the end time I'll give you enough word now you don't need to be over here yeah this is where you need to be right because they'll say I am rich and increased with Goods I'm okay I'm alright brother brown says it's okay you Pentecostals you got the baptism the Holy Ghost but don't cabbage down on it you drew a big line and you've not gone past it anymore he said now you guys say plus now plus God is moving on remember God is continually moving excuse me then but you're saying I'm saying I am Rick and I am increased with Goods and I have need of nothing go tell them go tell somebody and grounded in a denominational idea they'll tell you we're fine right where we are right and I need you telling me about this baptism in name for Jesus Christ my grandma baptized name and Father Son Holy One you see one thing they are neither nothing that and no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and Nick and you don't even know it that's what's bad you don't know that this is going on in your life you have no clue the dishes going on yeah my brother drowned message watch somebody walking through them through the streets and and then I got a stitch of clothes on you say hey buddy your necking he goes I'm gonna take your clothes oh my god oh my god right here that's how blind they are because God told them you need to get over into the promised land you backed out of the promised land now I give you a land you gotta promise just like Ishmael Ishmael got a promise this is not its mouth lamb this is children of Abraham plan right this is the children of Ishmael plan not saying that blueprint Wesley ritual hats but they didn't go home with God they stayed on this side of the river they went over and helped him find dr. baptism the Holy Ghost in tight but they came back across the river Reuben GAD and have problem with NASA's tight luther Waxman penticoff his brother Ram told us for the one to dish come in so now there's no way out of seeing Church age though God's saying look you're gonna separate them you either going to stay here are you gonna go across there's a group gonna go across because this is the placing of the people in the land by Joshua the Holy Ghost in the end time to place us up this natural perfect man all right they're making out there all right because they'll say I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing no it's not the top wrenching and miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee now see he gives them an out he gives them an opportunity I counts all of thee to buy of me what promised land stuff Promised Land things promises of the promised land gold tried in the fire that don't make me rich and white raiment that them nice to be clothed in other words he's he's putting he's putting everything that he took away back over here so you say you and increased with Goods and they need enough no idea wretched miserable poor blind and naked but now God is trying to reclose you give you gold the Word of God and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear wise in the club you and I'm going the hives with myself that's what the problem here they didn't had their eyes were dim to the full Word of God relation work right we got land we got all this is beautiful over here this is the plains on this side of door and we're good we got we got Cal and we got all you know we got her we got our lot of people but that nine and a half tribes one over there when they got in the Promised Land milk honey but they had to fight for it gold tried in the fire it's not easy going to possession of a perfect man right it's not easy at all it has no easiness at all to it but if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he promised he'd give it to you he promised he'd open your eyes he promised he would clothed you and he promised he would give you gold or a revelation the town man see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten which is us be zealous therefore and repent be zealous therefore and repent it takes a zeal to want to go up a ladder ladder is pretty hard a mountain is pretty hard but man when you see there's a big old piece of rock of gold or something up there on top of that mountain it makes even the old people come on climate but that's what we see we now we see within our high self that God's give us we now see clearly that there is what a colorful mountain and wants us today but it's going to be a hard journey calling sometimes you men crawl but is it but you can get to it as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent then we'll start right here next week let's stop right here and go go upstairs behold I stand at the door knock somehow he got outside of this yeah bride Church but we'll talk about that next week it's now these five men let's corner so we'll be up
