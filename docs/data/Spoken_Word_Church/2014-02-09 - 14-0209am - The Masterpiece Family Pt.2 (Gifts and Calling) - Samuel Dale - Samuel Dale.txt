Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and thank you that you have given us a day because it's a wonderful thing to be able to sit down for a little bit Lord and just relax on a day and have a truly arrest day that we can Lord listen for you and let you speak to our hearts and our lives we just ask you now that you'd come Among Us and open your word unto us because that's our desire we know that when if we want to see you then the way we see you now is through the revealed word because you're not physically here because we are your body while we're here upon this Earth so Lord we pray that you've got each one remember the sick among us you promised it so we believe it said you would send your word and heal us and we thank you for it we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Isaiah 53 remember we're reading this because it was the scripture the prophet used on the Masterpiece uh that he was preaching and he said that was a great masterpiece remember now it covers the Jesus Christ and you and I too so we'll get back one of these days to where the Prophet says the bride is smitten from their denominations in the last days so she's smitten also so just remember that okay who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry a dry ground he hath no form nor communication when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him brother said he looked like a piece of hamburger meat beaten up he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him we were despised he was despised in we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and cured our sorrows yet we did esteem him smitten stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he would bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed oh we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every man to his own way and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is done so he opened notices openness not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he hath done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days in the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I will I divide him a portion with the great and what and he shall divide the foil with a strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and bear the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressor right we go over to Romans 11 and we'll begin reading in verse 26 25. for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in so all Israel shall be saved that is written as it is written there shall come out of Zion to deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake what for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I've asked you to read or listen to the messages there and the prophet priests on the masterpiece and also seed not air with the shuck and that you would read these and it would help you to understand and then you could say well okay we know that's what is being said like I said I can take a and pull in as bad as I am with typing and things that take me half a day but I can type up some things and it not even be what he says you know but uh you know I want you to read and study yourself and then when I speak on it you know or someone else speaks on it then you'll find out that whether we're talking and telling the truth or not all right now notice the background that Paul is giving I was going to read all of this but we'll just go down through it in Romans 11 he covers the blindness of Israel he covers the the world of mankind or the Gentiles you know as we would say uh when he called it the world uh receiving salvation he covers the um Olive Tree you know the Wild Olive Tree the Jew the the Gentiles and the time Olive Tree being the the Israelites and he covers how the roots of all of this is Jewish and then he gets down in about verse 25 as we started reading and he begins to talk about when the fullness of the Gentiles become in all right then he says verse 26 that all Israel will be saved now we know that's not all Israel we know that's fifth seal Jew Israel and the coming in and people come the Jews coming into the Gentile dispensation but then he ends it up in verse 29 by saying for the gifts plural and calling singular now he doesn't say we'll do that a lot of times when you notice right around him sometime will say gifts and callings but it's really saying gift and calling because there are many gifts all right but there's really just one calling you know you're either called or not called that's that's just the way it is so it's not many callings you know you may be called to do a lot of things but not calling of the basis of Salvation there's only one salvation on as we'll read in a minute in the scripture but there's many gifts that go into that and now I want you to listen very carefully to the way that I'm trying to bring it and I'll go ahead and say a little bit in the front I want to cover this in the bases of light we did in the um predestination series and looking at it and seeing that it is a it's a great thing to talk about gifts and calling now there's many gifts all right but yet it's so amazing to me as I begin to think about it and and relate to it as how much the the prophet and the Bible would lay is to cover uh the gifts and how what they are and and the things of it and you know and how they work and uh you know so we'll we'll get to that and I really I really enjoyed brother forney's message is our Wednesday he didn't know I was going to speak on uh this you know because I didn't talk to him any about me speaking on the gifts and callings because he was talking about you know the the head being Christ and the and the ministry and the husband and the different things and and I hope you uh enjoyed that but now see what I want us to think about gifts we just say gifts we just say this say that about gifts you know and uh you know seemingly in the message people and I'm saying Lula as well that we have seemed to have laid the uh gifts as one brother preached here one time and I got so tickled his only time I ever heard brother Moe to actually speak out while somebody was speaking and uh he you know a lot of people did brother didn't say this part but a lot of people have preached about the gifts and just light them up on the Shelf you know just throw them away put them up on the Shelf get rid of them and that brother he was preaching along that and he he made the wrong statement he made the statement he said brother Branham said that that the fivefold ministry was just folded up like a piece of paper and laid up on the Shelf well that's all brother Mook could take he he kind of went through the other but when it come to that he said brother that ain't right something to that degree you know and uh just brought out but see we went we have done these things the gifts are here I believe in the gifts in the body of Christ now if we're going to do away with one or say that it's not important then it's just as well as doing away with all of them because there's no little thing in God and the big thing now there are some things that are more important yes and we have the things you know to look at of the prophet in the Bible to understand it sure but still anything of God is very important thing all right then we'll get down and talk to her you know about it see we have the gift of God as we'll read in a second which is what eternal life through Jesus Christ all right now the prophet of God then said it like this one time he said that you know something paraphrasing it that if we're in the body if you have the new birth and in the body of Christ that makes you subject to the nine spiritual gifts you know that's covered in the scriptures all right and he said that that basically you would have one of those gifts working you know as far as in your life if you got the new birth because it it comes even if you say well the new birth it comes forth and it brings us and we come up to knowledge we'll see knowledge be would be one of the gifts that would be the thing that all born-again believers need to have the knowledge of the Holy Ghost and the word of God right and also that would be it but now think about it there's many different types of gifts so if it takes a couple of services today I don't have no problems with with it I want you to understand what you know uh the point I'm getting at the of many different gifts and you just lump them up into a pile and and you've got a problem uh I'll go ahead and say it like this you you have regulations of some gifts qualifications are some gifts you know that you don't have with other gifts you know so then you got to define it but if you don't then you'll just lump it up into one and just gifts and you you know and you want to understand what the Bible is trying to get at but yet then you put too much emphasis on one gift and not look at all the gifts then you'd be going just as bad that away you know to go off and to go to in all right we come up in the age of of Azusa Street which was the restoration of the gifts that didn't mean that it wasn't working before then it didn't mean there wasn't any gifts it was just basically that he had done like I started out saying a moment ago like we are doing it now and I say we which is the right around the world is we've kind of isolated the gifts we don't have them in working in the the local assembly as far as gifts working and I believe in them right right you know but we've got the regulations see that's that's what people are afraid to use the gifts you know they're afraid to speak in tongues and then somebody else interpret because it they're they're afraid that something might go wrong well come on folks every time I get up here I'm on the spot you know what because I'm having to speak to you what I believe God has given me well I'd be glad to be one who spoke in tongues I would be glad to be an interpreter because an interpreter here's in his own language what the one speaking in tongues this is Brother random so we don't have to worry about it and you know every whole church could be speaking in tongues and if I was an interpreter I just sat there until I heard it in my own language everybody else will be hearing it in in their language I mean you know whatever was being said but I would be hearing it in my language all right and see I wouldn't have no problem but see we're we've kind of isolated things and the prophet of God said that a church without the gifts would be responsible and I'm a firm believer in them and I've never never tried to um kill anybody's influence with gifts I had one brother one time that some of them said well boy he was speaking in tongues well I was dumb enough to to be too much to speak I guess and and I said well that may have been true but he was speaking in Spanish he was just worshiping God in Spanish well it hurt his feelings because and what I say about it is is what I mean if if he would have been right he wouldn't have got his feelings hurt but when I brought it out it he was just worse than God in Spanish then he got offended at me well that meant he was wrong that's me I say it you know you know because it wouldn't bother me or none whatsoever but now let's get down to the thoughts of of doing it but as I said now look at all of the background that Paul covers in Romans to come down to say for the gifts and callings of God or without repentance now we'll get to it later you don't repent to get a gift you either have a gift or you don't have a gift right you don't repent to get one okay I would no way in the world tell you that I could go over here and pick up one of these musical instruments and play it because I don't have a gift there's no problem and to remember the prophet said you've been talking about his two girls one day we're listening to tape the other day and he said said there was one of them said I believe it was Rebecca now I'm not sure that one of them was going to learn uh you know play in taking music lessons and he said the other one said it's just come natural he said well if it don't come natural to you he said you're going to have problems because you can learn you know but it's better when it just flows and and everything and uh it'll work because there are gifts of all kind uh when we was in when I was in Brazil the doctor there he's uh yeah what do you call it um skin specialist type of operating but he uh he was the tops you know of doing those he said I can operate and he said I know right wherever nerve is and he said everybody looks at the way I do it you know doing those plastic surgeries he said I can just cut with a knife and never touch those nerves I said brother don't you realize that's a gift well he just broke down crying you know when he was a a real top-notch doctor you know and he just broke down crying he said never thought of that I said use your gift that's a gift from God doctors are gifts this is a gift that's a gift you know and a lot of us have the other one that we don't need a lot of times there's one called gift a Gab but we all have gifts all right but now what I want to talk to you about is is connecting it together with the revealed word all right now we were talking about and we'll get to back into it in a minute in that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the cedar word right 154 Church age book all right see then in doing that then the person is predestinated by foreknowledge because he knew where the gift was going to fall right all right that's fine but the gift itself is not just predestinated by foreknowledge all right and come on you follow my point now and listen the gift itself is the gift of God just like the gift of eternal life you know the new birth all right see then there are gifts that come actually predestinated ordained for ordained of God to be right now the person that it falls in is by foreknowledge that God knows where the gift will fall and what it will be is a person but yet the gift itself is from God now all right she didn't think about it as we we read a few scriptures I don't I'm not going to pull up a lot of it but I want to use the scripture so go ahead with with First Corinthians 12. because I want you to look at these and think about the things that we're trying to make a kind of a little lineup about and to see about it and Paul says in First Corinthians 12 verse 4 through 11 now there are diversities which mean different you know um differences in the gifts but the Same Spirit now Same Spirit same God working it all right and there are differences of administration with the same Lord and our diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all right now but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all right for the one is given by the spirit right the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit all right now again it's all the same Holy Spirit not many different Spirits all right to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these workers that one and self-sane spirit dividing to every man severally as he will all right then it's one God working through many gifts that he gives all right now and as it is don't think that well this is that now the devil can do things I know that I've got it to the last of the message where the devil can pass out Supernatural gifts don't ask me to explain that I can't it's up to you but it's what the prophet had to say about it all right see then he's got his own ministers he's got his own preachers according to the Bible because it calls them angels of light all right now don't ask me to totally try to explain that I just you know because he some way he has a supernatural ability to do things right and maybe if God allows that I know he would have to permit it or you know it couldn't come I know that much all right but think about it now all these worketh by the self-sane spirit dividing to every man severally as he will and the prophet said he said ever born again believer has a gift all right something in your life something connected some way that you can can uh uh you know relate to it okay now we do not believe I've got it on over later we do not believe in laying hands on well I've got scriptures right here or read them we don't believe in laying hands on people for giving them gifts right you know that's Pentecostalism but that's not in the scripture even though you got two scriptures it sounds like that but yet you know let's get to that point all right so go to First Corinthians 13 2 and look at what Paul has to say and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and do I have all Faith so I could remove mountains and have not charity and nothing so if you had gifts to be able to work and prophecies and knowing and not born again what good is it and it's possible to do that why because gifts and callings are without repentance you don't repent to get a gift the gift is there in your life I mean you know I used to be I told you about it I used to be to the point that you know that that when I talk to you you know how a lot of people do when you talk to them you ever watch them you know they'll they'll look around and look at them they'll never look an eye you know it's just something that people are that away well I was that away and I reckon one day I figured out hey nobody difference in them they are me so we're all the same just a garbage can I'll just look him in the eye so I'm bad now to look you right straight now when I'm talking to you because of that but forgive me for coughing but even back in my early life I saw what would come later you know after I come later you understand me after I got over here I look back and see okay uh you know and we would would uh we're in a vocational school one time and and uh the guy you know he kind of wanted to uh he wanted everybody involved so he wanted everybody to talk and he divided up you know and he he divided he said okay now we want this group to be right in this group to even be wrong so we know they're wrong that we want to do well they'd always give me the wrong side well sometimes I want people over an argument because it was just dire and then when later when I come into the ministry I saw what it was that that was working dire you know and the ability I had coming down even in schooling that I never brought a book home I never done nothing but I could have made all A's if I wanted to I'm honest I'm not that ain't that smart but I'm just saying it because I paid close attention as to what was being said if you pay close attention in school kids as to what's being said you'll learn more than you will at home reading your book just pay close attention to what is being said get involved in what is being said listen to that teacher attentively to where that they can explain something to you Abby the other day she had some work in my Lord first grade I looked at Anna I said how do you do this greater than lesser than all of a sudden the other they had the alligator you know I'm supposed to eat this one because they tell them little stories so she was adding and I mean she was adding like 27 plus 20 you know and uh you know I had to work it out and I sometimes I said well look here honey how about doing it this way I said take that 27 and put you 20 underneath and they still don't have the carry number over you know because it ain't that far up but yeah she uh when I showed her that she said that's the way the teacher said to do it well see that's that's the way you want to get to going you know is and then you can just add and you know what you got you know all right but see pay close attention to what's being said that's why I ask you to read and pray and study for yourself all right so Paul said even if I have those things like that you know it's still not there the prophet in the message called indictment maybe preaching 63 707 he's bringing he down and he's talking about that we do not believe in the ordaining OR laying on a hand we lay on hands for the ministers and ordaining ministers but he said we don't lay on hands to impart spiritual gifts we do not believe that gifts come by laying on our hands we believe that uh laying on our hands is a sanction to what we've already seen I mean all right so it's not a something you lay on hands to get gifts okay do number do first Timothy 4 14. neglect not the gift that is indeed which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery now that looks like it's totally contrary to what he's saying and that's what people will use that they'll use the next one first second Timothy one and eight or one and six wherefore I put in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands all right but yet we don't believe that we don't believe that you can lay hands on somebody to do you remember in the Bible the man that wanted to to have the ability to give eternal life even or whatever salvation you remember in the book of Acts and he wanted to buy it he said can I buy the gift of doing this and see there's many many different things and gifts that work you notice in that one time there was a I can't remember and I get the names messed up so but one time during the book of Acts they were praying for him to get the Holy Ghost and and they prayed for him and the Holy Ghost didn't come on them so they sent for I believe it was Peter and John and they sent for them and they came down and immediately prayed for them and they received the Holy Ghost well see there are gifts and things like that but not just because you put your hands on somebody it's not that away it's not just passing it out you know you're just stirring up the gift that was already there wrote around and said the first thing he remembered was a vision now you man I tell you what I I can only go back about four years old I don't know how dumb y'all are but that's as far as I can go back in my life I can remember about four years old uh chewing my daddy's tuned back and getting sick but uh that's about the first I can remember but he said the first thing he remembered 18 months old was seeing a vision now that's that's a gift all right and so you can remember things in your life that happens that you remember there's something different you know all right yeah but think about it now we don't try to do that we don't try to lay hands on the people to give them gifts because you can't do that but if you see somebody doing you know you see something lay hands on them pray for him to stir up the gift that is in them because you'd have to be God to be able to give the gift no matter what as I said well ago I can't explain how Satan can do it but evidently God has to control that right I mean I do believe that I believe he controls that point but yet see come from God Amen and if you have a gift that's a wonderful thing my wife used to she could sow and then she could just sit down and she just she'd make all work she made me suits she made the kids clothes of all kinds and made Anna all of her clothes well other people I remember Margaret she'd come to Nanny and say well can you sow this you know some people can just do things now tell me to turn a transmission apart and put it back together um we wind up like I did one day when I rebuilt a carburetor my wife came out and you know how you get all these kits and they give you all these gizmos it goes in it but you don't have to have all of them cause it for a different style and so she came out in our carburetor back together and she said what are you doing I said well I'm rebuilding this carburetor she said what about All Imports I said I didn't need it because how would I go and explain to her that just didn't need to be there and that had to be all the things you know but tell me to do something like that you're going to get a transmission Tour Part Richard took a motor apart up in the building one day and I said good luck and he put that thing back together he get them bolts they're just laying everywhere you know surprisingly it run but see there's gifts you sell insurance you know your real estate or whatever some people just can't do it it's just not made for them well that's a difference all of those things are gifts all right now but we want the gifts in the body of Christ and you know and working to help us all right but I want to cover this and then we'll get into to just breaking down some things go to Ephesians brother pull Ephesians there you know where we're going to uh Ephesians 4. go ahead to Ephesians 4. next one because I told them I wasn't trying to quote a lot on some of these things Ephesians 4 18 through 8-13 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now watch when you run that little thing around there I'm dumb but when you do that thing around there that means an insert you know something to help explain something to help you to be with so really you can take this scripture and put it right here right and continue thought because see when you talk about gifts unto men now he's talking about how that he's the one that ascended and he was the one that would he also descended you know so he's explaining what Jesus done the one that descended was the one that also ascended and all uh see then you pick up in the verse 11 and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ do we all come into the unity of the face and or the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now he's stipulating there to tell us that there are some gifts that are given for specific things now notice this and I'll repeat it because I know I won't get through this morning but I'll repeat it uh in the gifts you got the fivefold ministry in that faithful Ministry you got a regulation there of the husband and one wife and Etc et cetera Etc all right but now there is no regulations when you come to the nine spiritual gifts true now there's a difference in offices in just regular things all right so that's what we're we're going to get to you know to go on but he gave some who gave it but just remember if it's a gift of knowledge God gave it to you if it's a gift of wisdom or something it's a gift to teach if it's a gift to to play a guitar if it's a gift to to sing see God gave it to you all right you want to be happy about that and use that gift right let me use that you know for for God and let it work in the the ministry now I just want to go scan down too and then we'll pick our thought up repentance don't bring gifts the prophet said in the sign of the answer 62. repentance don't bring gifts he said you're born in this world for some purpose and you don't your repentance don't bring gifts they are predestinated to you all right so now gifts are predestinated to you okay now these are all got the parts in it where the problems say gifts and callers of God the Bible said all right and he says that in the message gifts 1956. that it's something that God by Sovereign Grace put into the church and God does that himself it's a work and an act of God all right a gift in the church is a work and an act of God all right now by foreknowledge he predestinates these things to happen Okay so now no matter what gift you're speaking of remember the person doesn't come predestinated eternally but the gift does the gift does all right now watch the point we're getting to the he said I'm I I'm trying to explain the gifts he said so it's a work or an act of God and by foreknowledge he predestinates these things to be he's not willing and he said perish so we know that he prayed Yesterday by what by his foreknowledge all right but by foreknowledge he knows where the gift will land right but by predestination he's already predetermined it come on are you with me no matter what gift it is he's already predetermined it you don't become a Christian to get a gift you're you're either born with it or you don't have it right and that's just the way it is you you you can practice and play a guitar but it's never as good as the person that can just sit down there with a guitar and and it wasn't and we used to ride to work together and this old man he he was left-handed and the guy that that in his car that day he up and have a guitar and he said get that guitar out let's play it a little well he got the guitar out and turned it upside down little brother uh Bartley he could do that he'd take a bass guitar play it upside down you know and I mean just beautiful you know and I was I can't play it upright or standing or whatever it is you know but that guy could play that thing and that old Feller said make it sound like an organ he could play that guitar and I mean you could hear it just like an organ playing because it was a gift but you know a lot of those people that have gifts don't want to use them right you know a lot of people brother um Lincoln Barner he could play in music and everything but his brother I can't remember his name but he could sit down and he only done it one day and he sat down and he just I mean it was just beautiful I said why don't you play that all the time he didn't want to play you've heard the old story The painter's house needs to be painted mechanics car foreign it's always that way preachers kids the meanest of all you know it's always tied up to something right but now listen God then predestinates the gift to the age Justice now listen I said gift now so I'm remember my point fleshly speaking or speaking you know us the person is not predestinated eternally but the word or seed is so if the person who's not predestinated eternally as to whatever that's by foreknowledge of where the gift Falls but the gift itself is of God and we take those gifts and we turn them around I'll read to you in a little while where the Prophet said we denominate with them because I could take my gift and I'm not no joke I don't worry about it I could sell fried ice cream to an Eskimo because I have a gift when I tell you and I'll sell you something you're going to pay what I tell you you ain't going to get it one penny less but I'm not going to try to get you any higher either man work one time he said you don't do that he said you have to go up and come down I said okay I rate it up 200 dollars but I'm bringing it back down to where it was because see I know what the gift is you know I'll get started and I'll use the gift and and it's just automatic you'll use it and you can deal with people and things you know like brother marker said they make millions buying cars he says I have trouble selling them it's a gift you know all right but see just like the word is predestinated for the age proving his word me the gifts and callings of God are predestinated to the ages and times and it's dire because it will be there because God foreordained it to be amen that's why you have it see that uh now Luther spoke in tongues according to his own record entire it wasn't that no gifts was working until Azusa Street in the Pentecostals came the gifts were working but they were kind of like I said now they were kind of just pushed down until they were not being used but then the spirit was loose of the gifts to come into order and yazusa Street the Pentecostal see started with the gifts all right and that's why it's called that age of the gifts but remember then it was predestinated to be that he wasn't predestinated of God to be in Luther's age because that's the restoration that we'll get back to later you know that's the restoration that was coming down all right but think about it now it was predestinated now are you gonna follow this one Adam was the word right will you go women there Adam was your word God made him and you know what he was predestinated eternally and uh don't tell me don't don't try to play games with me by well they fail that wasn't in God's predestination we ain't talking about that so that's where you're losing the game the man Adam had no choice he was created like that I'm trying to illustrate it Eve Adam had no choice of accepting a wife or not she was taken from him so that went that meant that that was going to happen you know and there was no way to change that from happening because it was predestinated to happen the same as the Lord Jesus was a predestinated Eternal person now that didn't make his body Eternal I didn't say that that was made Eternal in the resurrection but he was predestinated eternally you agree with that why because he was the word when you're dealing with the word saying something that's why I said that about this sitting there in the scripture Ephesians 4 see that's predestinated what there's going to be a faithful Ministry irregardless of what we think about it all right see there was going to be a Jesus Christ there was going to be the seat of the woman that would come because he was a predestinated person it wasn't something that that was done by foreknowledge to decide right right it wasn't that man fell and then he was four knowledge well okay I got to do something about it no he was the word so he was predestinated a predestinated person because he was almighty God all right and see then in doing that then you're not dealing with just the desires of anybody when you're talking about predestination I told you I wasn't through with predestination in that form I just getting it down to the bases that we could understand all right see Jesus Christ was predestinated for ordained now when you're dealing with predestination you're dealing with it by foreknowledge right God for new all right you keep that in line but when you get to the word for ordained or ordained that means it's determined that means it's going to happen all right see all of that on predestination was just a background for you to and me to understand something when you're dealing with something that's foreordained all right look what he says Jehovah Jireh 1961. now see gifts and callings are without repentance Jesus couldn't help being the son of God he was the son of God for ordained predestinated before the foundation of the world and even slain before the foundation of the world all right now he can use gifts and callings or speaking as to Jesus Christ and who he would be he said gifts and callings are without repentance you absolutely received them when you're born in this world as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1952 the Bible says that how many Believers believe in predestination for Nation election all right Christ was the son of God from the foundation of the world he was a lamb slain from the foundation world you believe that he was the woman's seed that was to bruise the Serpent's head you believe that then he was predestinated for ordained of God do you believe that he said do you believe Jesus was foreordained not a choice that he had it was a predetermined Factor right right why because he's the word now when you're dealing with the word remember it's a word that's predestinated eternally it's the word that's predestinated eternally but Jesus Christ was not so in the basis of having to have a foreknowledge sure by foreknowledge he knew what he would do and that he would die right but remember the he that for ordained it was the he that died order you're not dealing with him looking at something to happen and thinking about it mm-hmm he never thought about coming to the world and dying he knew that's what he was going to do remember the one we're talking about the Son of God had no choice he didn't choose to do that he would foreordained that he do that all right let's get that straight because we cover we'll get that this morning's nothing else let's get it right about a gift and a gift coming from God now what you do with it is don't deal with me on that don't play games with me on your mind with it and say yeah but we can do this we can do it that's you I can take my gift and sell for ice cream to an Eskimo yeah but that's not God trying to sell ice cream to an Eskimo he didn't give it to me for that reason he gave it to me to try to bring the word yeah all right now see then when we look at it we can see that lamb with almighty God he never decided to be a lamb right he never had a choice of being a lamb it was predetermined the prophet says go to Christ the minister God's reveal and see that if God didn't have a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve not maybe he would or hoped he would he said to let himself be expressed right so then we're dealing we're dealing with God the gift of eternal life that eternal life you receive in the New Birth he's almighty God it comes predestinated eternally but you and I where it falls is by his foreknowledge that he knows where to fall but not so with God come on you see why as I said it'll take me a while to preach it because you get it all mingled up in your mind and try to understand just remember you and I are not God the prophets were not God they were used of God and in being used they came so close until he could say that he was God to the people but yet when he stepped back he's Moses right he was gone to the people when he stood there and smoked a rock and water came out to feed up in the water all those two and a half million people in her cattle and everything I never didn't understand that I still don't understand how that River run all the way through because the Bible says it followed him where did it go now there ain't no record of it being no great big Rivers running down through there it evidently went out of existence I don't understand all that I just understand and believe it but now look while he was saying that he was told to Smite The Rock right that was the word of God but when Moses smote it the second time because of it and getting upset with the people that was not of God that set up a denomination your Prophet said and that meant Jesus Christ would have to be smitten again in the end time in this day right you see what I'm talking about but Jesus Christ himself was almighty God you know I I try to make it so strong where you said he didn't come predestinated he worked the predestinator he didn't come by foreknowledge he was before knowledge he was the gift of God because that's the only way to have eternal life that's why I don't agree with people that believe the Old Testament people have eternal life and this that and the other about it no because Jesus Christ is eternal life and he had to die to release that life for it to come they had the anointings for the hour and they had to wait until he came that's why they had to raise with him why because they were waiting on him but remember the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ predestinated for ordained of God I believe that gifts and callings as I said are without repentance that you're born here in the world with these gifts this is taken from gifts and callings or without repentance in 1950. just the same as you're born to be a musician you might give your child give it all kind of lessons but if that musical Talent isn't in it it'll never do no more good is that right but we're born the same way into spiritual Realms listen for gifts and callings of God or without repentance that you might know Jesus Christ was foreordained of God he was the one was seen from the Garden of Eden he said Do you believe it Jesus Christ was for ordained of God because he was God can you get that he was the one that done the forordaining but him and himself coming it wasn't a choice right right but around said when man fell in the garden God knew he had to do something and said he came himself he didn't send a son to die he came himself that's why Jesus would say unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins all right he was predestinated eternally to come and be here and be the word all right turn it all the way back to where we were at all right watch now led by the spirit 19 in 52. now I was born by a gift these gifts don't come by laying on our hands those gifts come by the sovereignty of God all right gifts and callings are without repentance they was foreordained of God to be gifts are born Jesus Christ in the garden he was the woman's seed that would bruise the Serpent's heel who was he he was the word he was the word that would come predestinated eternally all right that's why when we tie together the thoughts of predestination back into what we're talking about in the way we brought it down then surely God did use a man named Moses but remember Moses picked up the thought of God it wasn't his fault he picked up the thought of God and spoke it and it become word right because he himself as a person was not predestinated eternally now God knew where it would fall come on what do you need but how are you going to make it if he's predestinated eternally he's God how did you get it he said well I'm predestinated brother there then you're God if you're going that away but if you're lost and doomed and on the way to hell and realize you need to be saved and get saved then that inside of you right is just as Eternal as God is what kind of because it's God's own life it's not just as Eternal because he gave you something see I'm a firm believer in predestination folks but I'm a firm believer in foreknowledge to keep it straight but I will say this to you that I didn't put into that series that one day I'll get back to it that word before the world was predestinated eternally come on the person that fell into fails in foreknowledge that's why we are The Offspring of God that's my brother Brandon when he gets down to the last message he preaches the communion he said I found out I wasn't a son of Charles and Ella Branham he'd been thrown off when it was Mom and Daddy come on what was he saying he said I found out I always was a child of God what the eternal life that was in him the body wasn't because it died and went in the grave right so he certainly wasn't talking about the physical side you were talking about something inside of him and if that Eternal God could choose to come down to you and I and give his life that we could receive that life why don't we accept it and say thank you Lord and say Lord then now whatever you want done you take care of it wow see because then as the prophets those prophets come predestinated now listen to my point I won't spend but a minute my background this in this evening those Prophets the message they brought which is the word of God you agree remember masterpiece Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph laid the foundation you know the patriarch but the prophets built the body you remember that all right see then without those prophets that body would have not come into being right take out one of even the Minor Prophets anything take it out they wouldn't come into being why because it would not be a complete body those prophets built the body can't you just see as it was coming down all of those prophets and them saying Isaiah stand there one day and say a virgin shall conceive you know that meant somewhere there's going to have to be a virgin right to conceive when Naaman would say cherished Johnson in the streets running like lightning it would mean they would be one day that Buicks Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs will be run up down the highway with lights on because that's what he saw and he just spoke what he saw that never made him God but it made the message he brought right the word he brought was God himself he just used a man why because you remembering the story there in the Bible when they come out God was bringing them out he sent Moses down to do it sure but he wanted to be God to all the people he brought them to that burning Mountain and when I heard the Thunders and the Lightnings and things they said don't let God speak no more said Moses you go up and find out and you come back and tell us well Moses went up early he didn't go up there and said now Lord I want to explain to you they don't want to listen to you they want to listen to God and you when he got up there there's no statements in there that Moses explained it to God when he got up there God said I know what they're doing just like he said to Samuel he said they have not rejected you Samuel right he said they have rejected me you don't have to explain to God all of the things we spent half of our prayers a lot of time explaining something to him Lord you know I've been having problems I've been having troubles get out of business tell him what's wrong with you and what you believed he already Bible said he would for us to pray but see those Prophets born in the specific times for each one of them to be able to bring forth the word for the day that they were living and the word they brought was almighty God right that's why he could say Jeremiah which one of them he said I knew you before the world ordained you did he ordain the flesh that's my foreknowledge but he ordained the son of man right remember those prophets were a son of man speaking of the son of man which would be the Lord Jesus Christ all right but as their message was going forth you know what that message was the son of man that's why you can't separate them and those prophets come what gifts and callings are without repentance you believe in Ford Nation Moses was ordained of God for ordained when he was born and he would found a proper child John the Baptist 74 12 year before he was born he's a voice of one crying in the wilderness Jeremiah I believe it was God said before you was ever even born and for you was formed in your mother's womb I knew you and Sanctified you and ordained your Prophet over the Nations before you were born no can you separate so I said I back up on this again this evening but can you separate the gift from the person see that's where the trouble was we brought around him they couldn't do that they said he was almighty God and with all the signs and wonders was in his ministry no wonder they thought John was a great thing back there right you know John never done one miracle not whatsoever and yet they thought he was Elijah or none of this or whatever but do you understand God gives gifts God supplies the gifts you and I just enjoy the gift right but the main thing is the gift of God which is eternal life and that's predestinated eternally now the human flesh that was here that we're living in is by foreknowledge of God because he looks through and sees that that's right but he knows right where that gift is going to land you say well well brother Dale then that don't give me no hopes it don't if you don't want any come on don't play games if you don't believe you can be saved you know what you can't be God ain't gonna override you three more ages and make it get saved but if you believe it he can work then because he can give you the gift of eternal life his own life then can't you see him standing in those Prophets come on didn't he tell Moses he said Moses go down there and Moses said now who am I going to tell them he said tell him I am well that's pretty close from Moses wouldn't it if I Pharaoh what did I hear Moses say Moses is going to tell me he said I am yeah right that's what he said but Moses knew better than to think he was the one that was going to deliver them right but he knew if the I am was with him right amen so he'd go out you know he had Aaron speak a lot of times but to be flies he just go by and I don't flies no more nothing remember the snake story wrote it down stick and it become a snake The Magicians they just throw dirt down to become snakes too that's where our trouble is we get it all messed up by trying to figure out what God's doing trying to help him instead of relaxing this relaxing that God why because what is he going to do I told you before I've never come to church I have come to this church without an ordained line of which I was going to preach on but yet I don't worry about it I'm not concerned about it a lot of people and I know in the early Ministry when I first started if I was going to preach three weeks later I was already had everything done the first day and I was biting my fingernails and worrying about it till I got there within one day something happened and I said well Lord if it's you okay if it ain't you that's me anyway so get me out of the way so I'll just go to church and say come on I don't brag I just try to tell the truth I told them in the Bible study someone said let's just pick scriptures and and brother Dale you just sat down and start on that scripture you know Romans 1 and just start and read and explain it I said I'll make you a better deal I said let's don't plan those scriptures I said let's just wait to come to the Bible study because see I'd figure it all out I'd have it all explained brother I said look I said this is heaven no I trust a gift so come on we'll just come to Bible study and we'll just sit down take whatever scripture you want to talk about because if I don't know what it is I don't mind telling you I don't know what it is yeah but see a gift is a gift if you can trust it right but now let me say a little more and then get on to this this afternoon gifts don't save you gifts don't heal you run around with this here what are you depending on his gift s don't save you gifts don't heal you well now I just don't understand that brother I believe it does well then why would he go for months and months and months with his wife when that growth was in her side getting bigger and bigger and bigger if it's just like you lay it out to be that he just to do anything why didn't he speak to that don't you think he prayed for her every day I've had many a time my wife would be sick I'd lay over in the bed and just reach over and lay my hand on say the Lord take that thing away in Jesus name never say a word to her a few days later say you feeling better honey yeah that's well I could have told you I could have told you but there was no need of it because it already finished Zach sitting back there when he was born he had what I call yellow jaunders or what they call all those things or the factors in him they'd had to put him under lights and do things and I was down in the woods you've heard me tell it I was down in the woods deer hunting they called me and said Zach's real sick come on home I went and prayed I called my wife I said his act's all right she said yeah but said I think the kids need you I said do you think it helped them if I come home she said yeah I think it would I packed up came on I never prayed for him when I got home why because it already finished it was done if that was God it's going to be taken care of it wouldn't God would go back to the doctor I don't worry about it right come on gifts and callings are without repentance those prophets bring in that word of God the prophet said it was not for not for ordained not everybody 's not for ordained like a prophet's foreign gifts and callings are are foreordained let me get one more real quick this is taken from works as Faith expressed 1965. if what if Moses would have said sir just a moment I thought I was talking to an intelligent being this great I am that you say you are you know the burning bush right well Moses but how in the world will I ever take this little old Crooked Stick I got here in my hand and take over an army of millions of men armed with Spears Fighters and I'm not a fighter I'm a sheep herd how can I ever do that there was no question why why the ground in his heart now listen to what he's saying once God said it to Moses and he met him there there was no question of Moses you understand what he's getting out he said the ground in his heart he was a predestinated person give some calling to our without repentance God had told Abraham that he would do that and there was no was the ground prepared a prophet before Moses had said it would be done it'd be done there so long you know in all the prophets it said and Moses just looked back and said okie dokie if I'm the one it's okay if it don't I just lose my head you know he believed it Abraham believed God why was he some Supernatural person don't you just believe God see that's where we fail at all prophets are predestinated tape the court trial a court trial 64 4 12. all prophets are predestinated we know that gifts and callings without repentance Jeremiah said before you would ever have conceived in your mother's womb I knew you and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the Nations Jesus Christ was the woman's seed from the Garden of Eden John the Baptist 712 years before he was born Isaiah saw him and said he's the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord see gifts and callings ain't laying hands on being hands on one another it's what God does born from that birth and those gifts are right in you when you are born come on musician in there when you're born it was in Moses but just get what I'm talking about now and don't misunderstand me they told us in school one plus one equals two two plus two equals four the next day they said one plus one equals two two plus two equals four I got tired of hearing one plus one equals one but you know what one day they asked me to write it down and I could put it down on a piece of paper and I could mathematically make it match right or I could take it and pull it back the other way and say four minus two is two yeah why because I had some ground prepared over constantly saying it so I constantly say to you where you won't misunderstand me especially internet people I believe that all things in God he foreknew what would take place and foreknowledge comes before predestination your Prophet says it so that's up to you all right it's four knowledge first then predestination those who before knew Paul said in Romans he did predestinate all right for knowledge is first then predestination comes or determining the factor but when it's the word or seed of God it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God that person is predestinated by God's foreknowledge but to see their word is predestinated eternally and is going to take place God gives you a promise don't doubt it he told me Wade was coming someone told everybody was coming the father he went away the more I said it that's just like people you know they try to find some arguments excuses and brother random told sister how do you write that her two boys would be saved you know in a few years after brother run passed on and not it's been back a while ago and you know but they said they both Baxley and gone out in the world that didn't change me well brother Ryan was wrong no he wasn't wrong are they coming back I don't care they're coming by forget it he said it yeah but they're back said I'm sorry that I have too good of a memory the prophet says we backslide every day how would you like that okay is there a big backsliding and a little riding remember the big ones are not the problems it's the little backslidings it's the little foxes that spoils of iron because we don't want to correct them the big ones we want to get rid of them I'm talking about a predestinated word of God that before the world ever begun for he ever it was anything other than Elohim self-existing he already had those attributes and those attributes was himself and he was going to see his children displayed amen when Senator depictionary didn't change the story it made him bring forth the rest of his attributes so those Prophets and they come with the word that word they brought was God you remember who was it Elisha that cursed the uh the the children but when I said that was not God he said it was the gift of the prophet you know he he used it wrong and Balaam had a gift let's talk about it a minute Balaam had a real gift he's in the word of God his writings is in the word of God the Lord would come when it wasn't his already known the different times he's writing was there but yet he took and sold his gift right amen but don't you think God knew what he's going to do sure he knew but the word he brought is still the truth dumb donkey tell you the truth that old donkey was a good predestinated preacher what are we let's stand 206 206. anybody have a need ask me anybody have a name how about it foreign anybody else take away these problems in Jesus name believe and let's see Nation going on a trip to Hawaii so they won't it's hard to take care of them but it's in your Bell phone and that'll need to stay with you and we'll believe it it'll be all right okay father in the name of Jesus Christ we plead the blood for our brother and sister and his family that's going on a trip we ask you to take care of them give them a safe journey and let them see Lord you were hand working with them taking care of them in Jesus name amen amen just believe it anybody else would I rise just make sure that our calling an election is sure remember the scripture we talk about gifts and things but we ought to be concerned with the calling verse calling us to eternal life calling us to a high walk in the Lord calling us up to a rapture this is the age this is the time why can't we believe it so just make sure of that calling also Father just Bless the people to be with everyone in Jesus name you dismissed it's me bye foreign
