where we've been reading in Romans 8. and we'll try to continue our thoughts on we've been off for a while so it's giving you a time to relax a little bit and think about what's being said so now we can get back into our thoughts and ways and going on remember Wade and June to be leaving tomorrow in the morning and just remember that they'll be gone for the weekend and pray the Lord would bless and take care of them and bless each one amen just continue to remember the little little baby there that you know out in New Mexico just keep it in your hearts and keep praying that the Lord would would take care of the child and everything you know make it all right you know yeah Romans 8. the heavenly father we thank you for all things and we know and realize that you give them to us freely so all we got to do is just accept it and say thank you and father then we as the Bride of Jesus Christ cry out for that that little child Lord there that you'd reach down and touch the one there in the hospital there in New Mexico Lord just be with each one be with the family oh Lord you know just bless and take care of everything because we believe you and we thank you and truly our hearts go out for the little ones like that and just make everything to be whole and be right because we believe you and Lord we ask you now to be with us in the service tonight and just speak to our hearts and may Lord we Look to You the author and finisher of our faith and believing that thou art God and you change not so then we can depend upon what you say unto us we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness and guide us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose to whom he did for not for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things what could be said to all of that wonderful wonderful statement if God be for us who can be against us he may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word I hope you've enjoyed the time that you had to hear these other brothers preaching and and everything and enjoyed the fellowship with him we pray that you know that it would open our eyes and we may see the Lord moving Among Us now we've been for some time speaking about the thought of how does God predestinate and we've been kind of you know off for a while on the thinking so we'll just let's just review a little bit and come up to the talk tonight and just move on in the the word and just gradually progress him you know further and further into the the message of what we believe can we see that God predestinates by his foreknowledge not by his desires because he desired it all be saved sure now we're going to get in tonight in going on back into the the back part of of God's mind is the prophet would speak of and all but let's just make sure we get into the right place because see if we just we take something and we take a quote we take and say well these quotes here we believe this and the prophet said this well all right amen he said those things but now does it line up all the way through to where we can keep a thought or have an understanding or you know about something and and all like that because that's the only way that I can go is to follow something and just see it full unfold and unfold if it stops unfolding then I've got a problem because I know and realize that it's not from God so then you know I believe over the years that he has been doing that for us here to unfold his word down through time to where we could could follow it and I certainly appreciate that but now God desired that all would be saved right amen now so then we say yeah but you don't understand brother Dale you don't understand predestination in God and his ways of doing oh maybe I don't but I'm trying and and uh I'm trying to keep a lineup that that I don't have to change as I go along you know or say well that's a little wrong here so I got a line up here you know and I'll uh I'm just trying to move on progressively in the message of the hour that we can see all right then if we can see truly who we are and what we are then by taking the prophet's message we don't have to deny any quotes he says we can believe it all right we can accept it you know and we can go on with with understanding and and that way then something the prophet would say won't be a uh discouragement because we already have the answers to you know what those things are and we believe it see now if you approach to me I've tried to explain it to you it's the way I see it if you approach predestination by not going by foreknowledge first then you're predetermining something and God doesn't do his ways like that he created us made us sure and he knew what we do amen but you know then when the prophet would come along and say you always was eternal right well then just find out what he's talking about right amen I mean that's the easiest way you know we can make a lot of emphasis about big fancy quotes and and saying things you know but will it keep lining up right or are we constantly having to uh correct the prophet you know and all to make it fit our thoughts you know are are saying he corrected himself when we can't find the correction that we just change over you know and go on but see that way if we approach it by foreknowledge then we don't have to worry about any quotes that we have they'll line up with that four knowledge stalk because we've been through it where the Prophet said for knowledge the predestination looks back to foreknowledge all right so then four knowledge comes first then predestinating to the destiny followers after foreknowledge amen so then foreknowledge is always first right right is that a way you don't have to worry about what you're talking about you could say Jacob have I loved and he saw have I hated even before they were ever born that God would know what they were going to do and that he could predestinate accordingly see that it wouldn't be him making the predestination is we make our own predestination we determine our own predestination because he gave us a choice of course if it's like I told you there's people in the message that believes the bride don't have a choice she just stamped and that's it sealed and is over with and don't even need nothing and don't even need Jesus to come and die for us because we always was eternal well I just don't believe it anyway I'm honest and you know and and all but I want to I want to see the truth of it all right and we went over it and over it how that God is infinite and he knows all things before they ever take place if not he's not God what kind of a god do we serve amen amen do we serve an all-knowing infinite God that knew that before the foundation of the world that we would be the way we are are we just serving a god well maybe he does and sometimes he's right and you know no he's infinite all right see then by being that away there's nothing going to be different from what he would be able to have four knowledge off right but now remember one point I tried and we'll read this again in a minute that God cannot make us wrong and judge us for being wrong he can't do that it would be contrary to his infinite wisdom he would be like me and you he would be picking and choosing and and deciding what he wanted and what he didn't want you know right but see it all comes out to The One Thing that he gave us the ability to choose all right and he will not override your free moral agency we went through all of that right let's go ahead and pull up number one and let's read that one because I want these in your mind to think about before we get on over a little further in the message and look what the prophet said this is taken for power transformation of Precinct 65 10 31 in the morning service paragraph 132. he just let them out there on three more agency to let them Act he couldn't make them do it and still be just and what he could put them with put them equal with him all right that's right no and free moral agency and then let them do it themselves and he knew they would do it right so that he gives us a choice a free moral agency and made us equal with him what's what is remember what we were bringing out there's no way as a human mortal we can be equal with God that's that's not the point right right the point is that he gave us the choice and he will not override that choice that's right man see that would make us equal with him not not equal to him trying to be some kind of a great God or his great equal you know like that no no it's the point of giving us a choice right that would make us greater than the animals greater than any other the creation that we can make a choice sure he knew the choice we'd make right I mean he knew that if he doesn't know that he's not an infinite God we'll see if we'd have just took into account a few things down through time mankind wouldn't have been so confused about predestination but I'm talking about the people of this message now not down through organized religion you go around and just to some of the people predestination you know brother Dick's always good about going out when I'll tell you some denomination believes this that or the other you'll go find him one and talk with him well go find you somebody in the message and just get them to explain predestination you'll find mass confusion and they don't deal with four knowledge because see that means if if God is dealing with on the basis and I tried to explain that that if he gave us a choice and by foreknowledge he would know our choice that's no problem because he's infinite but then that would make predest foreknowledge to me is greater than predestination yeah I tried to explain that you know foreknowledge to me means he actually gave me a choice well you just don't understand I agree with you maybe I don't but that's the way I believe it anyway that he gave me a choice and I accepted that choice and by doing that then surely there was a connection in me to eternal life somewhere I can't believe that that's no problem that's what we're going to try to get on to tonight if we can get into that connection that that part that would bring us to a better understanding of life than being but if we approach it any other form then by foreknowledge being first and we gave you that one on go ahead and put up number two words with anybody on the internet they'll see it too this is the power of God 19 and 50. uh five 1006 the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word foreknowledge is better predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination all right but God not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way but God in order to be God he knowed to end from the beginning so he could predict it and set things in order to happen but see if he if we take it the way we're thinking you know well I always was eternal and I just of all of these great doctrines to see doctrines see we haven't got back in there yet to where we want to on that we talk about all about all of us we say oh this eternal seed I just always was eternal well what are you talking about if that be true then Jesus Christ died in vain because you don't need the death of a savior to draw you to a knowledge you're listening you don't need a savior to draw you to a knowledge you need an opening of your understanding right see you say to somebody said well well you know uh what do you mean you always was eternal Jesus Christ died no no he had to die now that I might be able to understand this you're making a knowledge out of it instead of a birth right right he had to die to release his own life not to release his knowledge all right amen amen amen all right what you see then predestination looks back before knowledge all right so foreknowledge is first right then you come to predestination yeah but brother Dale I was just elect well all right go ahead on number three where people will have that and they can read it and you can read it too adoption in 1960 515 the evening service paragraph 106. listen to this predestination looks back to foreknowledge I mean election I want you election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to Destiny but see that's where people don't want this they don't want this quote they want the other quote where running around them says I never was a pig I never was a dish I never was there I was a true seed all the time well now he's the one that said that we were a couple Bird right all right now you're going to have to tear this one out I don't have to because I know what he's talking about the eternal life that you have by the new birth never was a pig or a hog or a kookaburra we were right what do you think we need to be saved for all right amen come on so he says now election look backs to full knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is I was a cuckoo bird don't call me if we got one time you know and I preached about something he said don't call me Serpent seed big boy well I was just quoting behind him but what he'd said you know but the thing of it is see don't call me a kookaburra well the prophet just did so you're gonna have to rip that out so that was one of the things he was wrong about I guess well as he Wellesley brother phone he says he said I was a cucumber I was born in sin saved an iniquity come to the world speaking Life Born amongst Sinners father and mother and all my whole family Sinners I was a kookaburra but all of a sudden I became a wheat grain how did it happen I that what is that election God before the foundation of the world elected that the Kookaburra was to become a grain of wheat now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved right I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved I know I'm not a hog I know I'm not all of the nature or the ways of the world why because I'm saved all right see then that way you could put it all together and you don't have to deny the things he goes on to say your destiny then it's going to take you where you're going but you do you understand now as we try to go on a little bit tonight do you understand what I've been trying to say I believe you must come into the world or that everybody come into the world lost except Jesus Christ I don't care if you talk about brother Brown who you talk about that's right because he said he had to be born again every person but the Lord Jesus Christ had to be born again person came lost I believe then that you must receive eternal life right amen and to do that you must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Spirit not to just believe on Jesus Christ or believe the message or believe the prophet see that's what everybody says I I know I'm safe because I believe the prophet well the devil does too now does that make himself but you see then I believe that eternal life catches up with us down here amen and I'm going to say this and ain't going to explain no more because I just you know I believe then that there's just one eternal life that's right amen that's right that's Zoe I believe we must receive Brother Ray that eternal life to become a born-again Christian that way I believe that there's only eternal theophany I believe there's just one soul that was created there in Genesis 1 26 and 27. amen amen and I believe that Soul then is your theophany and the prophet explains that a sinner even has a theophany right there's only one maybe two quotes I know there's one because of theophany means a amen that's that's the term or thought body of God all right the sinner has a place to go to when he dies right that's his soul right his soul is going somewhere right amen so he has a body right that's a downward currency he has a body right right he he to go to amen the born-again Christian who has eternal life in their soul then our soul is an upward current in your soul then page 80 of the Hebrew Book your soul is your theophany you know that way you got a body for God to live in all right now he's not satisfied with living in this body although he has to on the basis of where we're at that's why he's trying to change it he was pleased to dwell in Jesus Christ in that body totally pleased with that body that he was living in but he's not totally satisfied with living in our body but yet he's pleased to dwell in US I believe that I believe when you receive eternal life that God is pleased to dwell in you but not please the way that he wants it because he wants us to bring these bodies under subjection to him right amen so then we are a body for God to live in but your soul is your the off in the end that that is the body that where God is living he's not living in your body he's not living in your spirit he's living in your soul by the new birth Soul comes to Soul and that's why he had to give his soul a ransom all right giving his soul a ransom he paid the price he said he sent back to baptism of the Holy Ghost his soul right in the form of that baptism of the Holy Ghost amen to give our soul eternal life right now it's us and God together in there he says one because he come in to make your soul Eternal right now your soul is your your theophany you're going upward where before then we were going downward right we have a place to go to right now and see that either way we can look at eternal life and believe it and see that God did as we're going to read he truly did have a plan and a purpose right right that he was going to achieve that would require that he would have to come into flesh and to die to release that life that was within him amen now the anointing it could be unconscious right and was because he prophesied it was better for one to die for than for the whole nation to suffer but see his soul was lost right that's why I don't believe that any of the Old Testament people had eternal life in their soul that's right amen they had the anointing of the Holy Spirit right right to anoint them right but you had to wait of Calvary where Jesus Christ would come and play the prize and then come and live in US go back to spoken word's original seeds and places like that where the Prophet will talk about that there was 120 of them laying in that Upper Room Little Seeds he called them waiting on eternal life waiting on the return of the promise of the Holy Spirit see then that would be the promise there in the scripture where he says he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost they didn't receive it right there your Prophet said that that was a promise amen so then when he said so and so has eternal life just put it where it's supposed to be put it in the category because we're going to find out there is a connection even a foolish virgin will one day receive eternal life you agree right that's right at the white throne you know as far as God is concerned they're already have it as far as he's concerned right but yet they haven't received it yet as far as he's concerned the field sealed you is already sealed in they don't hand it yet you see that's where I believe that we we are we come into the world and God then by foreknowledge knowledge before that he could look down and see who would accept it and who would not right and he could write her name in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world or he could leave it out because he would know what choice we would make see maybe you don't follow it I know I know everybody don't follow the way I think and I'm proud of that going to be a bad world see then by looking at foreknowledge I see that my choice had something to do with it right that's why I gave you the quote there one day that he said about David he said David I know your desires David desired to build God a house when God said you can't do it David didn't get all puffed up Madden and all we're good with blessed God you know no he said okay I accept my part because I lived it I don't blame anybody else for my life right right amen I lived my life what do you do well people don't like me because the way I live well then you lived it if you live different they might not they would probably like you better I know that's hateful but it's truth but you see then he could look down and see my choice mm-hmm and then he could make sure there was a price paid amen amen come on he couldn't be a savior he couldn't be a Healer unless somebody was lost or something right right exactly right well then we are helping him fulfill his plan amen we are the part that was lost but if it's all predestination predetermining then you wasn't lost do you understand if it just totally stamped predestinated for the world you was it you was there that done There's No Redemption in that how could you display him as a savior or how could you display him as a Healer right he wouldn't be a savior he'd be a maker of us wrong in the killing of those that he wanted to right come on what you think about it that one day God just crossed my path and when he did I was never the right from then on no problem when I saw God at 11 years old there was never no satisfaction in this man's heart until he found that God maybe you it was a different age or older or whatever but if you're born again today then you met God somewhere you made a choice somewhere something happened to you somewhere but you see I just never was satisfied and I'm not today because of what I saw but yet we want to make it as to something else and I know the Bible says salvations of the Lord Jonah 2 and 9. that's wonderful that's exactly right why because I was lost and he saved me it's never been him but I still had to accept it amen I had the choice of whether to accept it or not right amen all right by doing that Tim it's not making me as a part to do with my salvation no it's making me with accepting the pardon that he gave to me hmm but I did have to accept it why because I'm a free moral agent like I said you know people who say well I don't want that whosoever will I want that bride I'm bride don't talk about whosoever will to me well I'm glad it says that because there's a whole lot of Samuel Dales in the world and if my name was even written down somewhere you know Samuel Dale was written in heaven which one of the Samuels you're talking about but see when I when it says whosoever will let him come it gives us a not a part to do with being saved but a part to do with receiving Jesus Christ and then I know that I've talked to you this and surely you're going to remember once that baby is born that baby cries and desires and Longs for food to eat you don't have to wake it up it'll wake us up with watching a little old cash today just fresh born and it's so amazing a fresh born cash just minutes after it was burnt it's stumbling and all trying to get up and trying to do and and everything and you just sit there and look at it and just cry because seeing that how God can lead them right and sometimes if that cash doesn't work exactly right that Mom will get nose to nose with that cash and just start backing up is making the cake walk you know after a little bit that cash starts hunting for something and it may start like that one did today three or four times at the front and trying to find some smell all and even started punching up under it where did it learn that thing from you know when a calf when it yep when they start nursing they'll just start bumping the mama you know come on give me some more meow and finally that little guy found that place if God could do that for a cave what can he do for it a child of God but you know that little cave had to get up that little calf had to move around that little calf had to find its way that little calf had to start nursing but you see the way people preach salvation in this message you they preach it at a point of you not having anything to do with it oh the Lord done this and the Lord done that I don't blame him for everything I've done I don't even blame the devil for everything I've done maybe you do but I know what caused the fall but I know what I volunteered for too all right amen I know I had a choice for not having to do them things but are you listening I'm trying to just get a point then we'll just read a little bit and make a few comments about something I want you to see but I want you to understand what I believe if nothing else I believe God set back there and by his foreknowledge not by his predetermining right by his foreknowledge he saw time and he saw every person that ever come into the world and whether or not they'd want to be saved right I've explained to you how I believe as a human or so wonderful the prophet would say that even that Heathen said he'd be judged according to his own laws well I rejoice when I read that because I wondered what's going to happen just to get all them either that don't ever hear yeah I mean are they just wiped out no that's a human being and he judges them according to their own laws or their tribe sometimes that's according to your prophet what a great message we've had to explain eternal life to ever form or talks about it even to something like that to where that a person can never even hear you know how it's taught by organized religion you don't get born again you don't go to heaven foreign what are you thinking about what I'm trying to say I was born a kookaburra right you was born a kirkiver I don't care who is listening or saying you was born a kookaburra brother random was born a cockleberry now don't be that way brother Dale cause we won't put him what he moves out of what you're going to give him salvation without Jesus Christ I don't agree with it well I'm sure glad you know I'm glad that's not all judged on me too I'm tickled to death it is not all judged on my thoughts and my ideas because if I did none of us would have a hoax and that's not sarcastic that's true but you don't realize that God looked down through there he saw Jacob and he knew what Jacob would do they knew what Esau would do exactly and he knew that if he left Esau here for 500 years more he would never change but he knew you would want to be saved so we had it for you when you came what about a savior a redeemer and you and I are displaying his attributes if it wasn't for the carnal mind and the wrong applications I'd like to preach a little bit about you know it was a good thing we failed because we helped God fulfill his desire would you be willing come on would you be willing because your savior wanted to desire for something from you would you be willing to do it amen Paul said he would that I would be a Castaway for his people Israel did he mean that he evidently did but you understand what I'm saying then it's not some picking this and picking that as we'll read in a minute I'll read you one in a minute before you get time I wrote a random I told you before we've read it where he said he said he would Elohim self-existed but it said he'll never be that again you're right it's not justifying our ways of things that to make it turn out to where we could bring a savior I hope your carnality of your mind is not that bad but it's the basis of realizing what we've done you realize he would not be a savior if there wasn't something lost that's right but now get the point being lost don't make him a savior you listening being lost don't make him a savior it's when he saves us amen right amen that's the part we have to do with it Danny is when he saves us then now he's a savior amen to a person that's going to be lost he's not going to be a savior right right he's not going to be a savior to a person that's rejects him and his loss he was there for them if they desired it amen amen right I'm trying to get you to think about your own part because whether you believe it or not the Lord did speak to me something about the Rapture and that right there is where it's tied to and I'm trying my best to explain it that you and I are going to have to find something personal yeah right yeah and get away from just God sent a prophet and we believe it or this we believe that or we believe that this but get down to something personal and if we can't realize we was lost and God come down to save us there's nothing personal about our lives then that's right I'm talking about something that's in your life that he looked down and Saul and he liked it I don't see I could like I don't either I don't see I could like anything in our lives but there was something about you try it he went on top we want to talk about this seed that was in US where do we get all of this thought out before you talk about that you notice I hadn't said anything about it I believe in a predestinated seed I believe in a predestinated Eternal seed those notes are laying on the desk but if we don't approach it this way we'll muddle it up into our thinking right especially we can't find something with our own selves and our own thinking in our lives to put ourselves into the form of salvation he's not a savior for something that's not saved he's not a Healer for somebody that's not healed so then maybe there is something about this that in some way he connects us but it's got to be something personal I've always believed in that I've always believed in first a personal God I do not believe that I serve the same God that brother dick Addison serves it may be the same person maybe the same God may be the same this that or the other but it's not the same God why because he's my God right he's my savior amen you got to have your own personal experience with that savior amen right so that it's not a husband and wife of fire that's right right or sister Gayle she told me when they come up to be baptized she said I'm going to be baptized because my husband wants me to I said I won't baptize you that's what I told her she knows it I said it will not baptize you not just because your husband says you do it I won't do it we talked a little while and I looked over at her I said you're not pulling nothing over on me you see what I'm talking about she said yeah I said okay now we'll do the baptism you see I believe in a personal revelation that's right a personal God that lives with inside of us and that way then we are fulfilling his plans he had a plan and a purpose he knew before the before there would ever even any natural world or anything he knew what he was going to do that's right but he knew that all he had to do was just put us here and we'd fall come on folks don't be so super duper religious thank you God also knows right now you stick your nose in the wrong place you got a problem he don't give you a choice to go running around for those things beware no you'll never be lost not if you're ever saved no I believe in the growth development in growth development in our Christian Life that's right that will bring us to a place that we don't have no other desires but him we all used to in our lives had plans or thoughts in our lives but that ought to be going out of the way now getting to the bases we see what he wants but do you understand that what I've been trying to drive because I want to read something to you and then we'll start from that I believe that you come into the world lost doomed and on the way to hell I was going to title the message not the condescending of God but no I'll have to get back to that on another message and come over but God did come down Amen to die yes oh but brother my God can't die I suggest you find a God that can all right you ever but he's not tangible he's not well you know and like I always say I know that but you know those animal skins that came off of those animals in the garden for Adam and Eve was they removed by a spirit you know well God is a spirit what did a spirit just come down and pull that off that makes him bloody you thank God for being bloody he pulled them skins off them animals and put them on Adam and Eve but I just can't see God that real why after all that we've been through why can't you see him as real come on you mean you're more real than he is but I just never thought about him being that real well maybe you want to start thinking about it well it's just a theophany well that's the oven is the body of God from those animals right well okay well see we want to lay on the bases the people of the message lay on the basis with a lot of there's a lot of quotes that brother Brown will say if you have eternal life of course they leave that out they don't quote if you have eternal life you always was eternal they don't want the if there because that's a possibility or a question right me um no they want it to be I have eternal life I was born with eternal life oh my god well then Jesus Christ died in vain right that's right you had to get it somewhere where did you get it well I always had it well that's predestination then that's predetermining all things and giving no one a choice of nothing you follow me but do you understand we look back to foreknowledge and that way we can follow through the scriptures and read and no problems that those who he foreknew he did predestinate those who before knew he did predestinate that's why I made that little drawing go ahead brother Anderson and pull up that drawing that I made the other day and there's a whole lot of more things could be put onto there but it's just enough to give you an understanding from where you're looking on this and it says mine and if you notice it's split in both forms because it has to be because if this mind here is not according to that mind there then you've changed it somewhere but then you can look over and you can see that even for knowledge would bring a lamb slain your name could be written in the lounge Book of Life only because that he saw the lamb would be slime then you can go through election calling you can go through the mind of God you can go to predestination choosing for knowledge for Saul for no Plan of Redemption you can go through the cedar word and still not be in the back part of God's mind that we want to talk about but you'd be in his mind of what would take place and what would be see then we come over into time and life and you get a free will free more agency Choice Destiny and time receiving eternal life justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost glorified becoming the word adoption Redemption completed Cedar word whosoever will those are just some of the thoughts of getting us into a thinking about a a dividing and it's like I told you over and over and we'll keep going over Judas was in the mind of God so then this just being in the mind of God is not the whole key everything that would ever be in the world is in the mind of God they were personal every thing ever thought ever Nat everything would be in the mind of God see then I don't want to just be in his mind I want to be a part of his mind I want to find my place connected with him because I believe in that I believe that eternal life that you have Brother Gary is the life of almighty God and that always was eternal I just got to receive it here but then by that eternal life is a part of God look what you probably had to say look at we get number four Christ's mystery of God reveal 63 7 28. paragraph 102 103. now God's Great secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind that's the title of the thought of we're still on how does he predestinate but the thought is what back in the back part of God's mind now there would be no way that anyone could uh get that thought like that as I tried to explain the last message or somewhere right in there see we think well I have this thought and I believe that thought was what God had before the world does it fit the word well I I can't rightly find it in well it didn't come from God sorry were you telling me I can't think amen I just told you you can't think because that's what he's done right she said I thank she messed everything up but if we can take them do away with our thinking and get his mind let the mind that was in Samuel oh that's not exactly what it says isn't it it was the mind that was in Christ being you amen the mind that was in Christ in the very Mind Of God Amen back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it now what was his motive in order to let himself be expressed thank you because first there wasn't even a Moon Star at a molecule or anything he was God we didn't actually wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing wasn't nothing to worship Him now we know that he explained in other messages the first thing he done is created angels that was the first thing it wasn't you and me the first thing God created was angels they worshiped him he became God that's where it says in Genesis 1 God in the beginning God created heaven and earth see he had already received the form of God by the Angels worshiping him but that was not the worship that he wanted we're the only ones that can worship him the way that he desires but for to be God he was already gone by the Angels are you with me do you need those quotes you need that dog listen so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed you remember how I preached for years on that God never gained attributes coming this way he always had those attributes well he wasn't a Healer he wouldn't say no that's displaying it right that's a displaying the attribute our manifestation of the attribute he had those attributes in him all right so you're looking back there and seeing a whole lot more about God than we ever thought about what we when we had our organizational Minds about what God was the best we could do would be able to come up with a word something of self-existing but we're going to get down to a point to eventually to be able to see It'll be Sunday I know now but God's thoughts are eternal he could never have a new thought what a wonderful statement but think about it he wanted these attributes to be expressed and him was love and him was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be a savior and him was to be a Healer and all of these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God now he never gained him he displayed him he never gained him coming this way that's why I changed the title of the message I was going to go into the condescending but I'd rather put it the back part of God's mind and you think about the back part of God's mind and just comprehend that a little the back part the only way we can comprehend that or even think about it is by way of Amos 3 and 43-7 where he said I'll do nothing but reveal my secrets to my servants the prophets well even all of those Prophets Paul went into the third dimension you know third heaven or whatever not Dimension third heaven and came back and said I can't even tell you run around and said I believe I went to the first heaven he come back told us about it right Paul now you want my understanding of that What if Paul had wrote it back there what he saw right he wouldn't have been no mystery secret left down Through the Ages and it wouldn't been dependent then upon Malachi 4 as to be where all the Mysteries would be revealed because Paul would have showed us all the Mysteries I believe he went to the third heaven I believe he saw Jesus Christ as no man has ever seen him until the end time by way of the Prophet then we can go back into God's mind and comprehend things or think about what he could think about all right now pull the drawing back up and you'll see what I'm talking about remember in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was going to achieve it was going to express himself so back in here even back as far as you can call him self-existing and that's why I've always tried to say this one little point to you people keep wanting to go back and go back into the mind or go back and and great things that they are or what this are be careful you might take yourself out of existence amen carnalist my mind is I can see that anything on that line that away if that's as far as I go in the doctrine that I'm trying to bring I could go out of existence they mean nothing to you but that's the way I see it if that's all we see if that's all we know going that away I'm emphasizing it then we could take ourselves out of existence as they're saying the other day about me I'm about to say see I don't say C I said c hmm because I want you to see you know but if we can come over here into the back part of God's mind no I'm not a doctor or terminology isn't crazy and all like that because I don't understand but I do understand that the front part of your brain is your intelligent part that you're thinking with you live here this is the the front part is you're knowledgeable existence of here you know and being life and do it is the front part of your mind when you go into the back part of your mind the prophet explained one time that you go into the subconscious see because you have out here the conscious part of you as you're dealing with life and and then you go into the subconscious all right now you took a profit to be able to go back into the subconscious because remember you and I are we're not born with the ability but he was born with the ability when the doctors tested him that day he said you could dream a dream without going to sleep they could prove that with their machinery him said your conscious and subconscious is right together see he could be out here in the mind of God and be back here in the mind of God this is as far as you and I can go I didn't say as far as we'll go like you think because by way of the prophet and without taking our own uh thoughts and Concepts or ideas would just listen to what he says someday we might find us further back than this line that we're talking about I believe in an eternal God I believe in the children of God the children of God are a part of God not a part of Jesus who was a part of God what a part of God if we just keep easing along maybe we'll find out a lot of things but let's be careful how much we think because we don't want to do as the others has done to run off with great ideas of always was eternal now you check this and see if I'm right the biggest portion of those people that teach that I always was eternal in the wrong way have gone into adultery physically now you want to name some names no I won't do it don't have to just listen to what you hear listen to what you're listening to you hear these other preachers preach well how do they preach eternal life they can throw out a lot of clothes and you you get so much as kind of like some of the brothers done with it in that Daniel 70 weeks I never if I went the way they believed it I'd be the most Mass confused person I've ever seen in my life because to try their best to disprove what Wade and I had taught on they would go this way with it and they'd go that way with it and one brother he stood right here and he had he actually preached seven years of Jesus's Ministry back under three and a half years with Gentile under three and a half years with the Jews back Yonder oh my Lord man you got better sense than that but I reckon he didn't not just honest but you see we get a thought and like one brother he said I set up for three or four days weapon a night four in the morning to get this that I've got well he I'm honest I'm sorry he'd been better off his lab I'm honest sorry that don't make me nothing but the truth will stand amen amen just keep moving along real slow let's talk a little bit about this part of him dwelling alone let's go back to that back part of God's mind and think about him dwelling alone and remember the prophet will explain that that is back before atoms or molecules or anything that we speak of you got to go from them back past all of anything you can think of as being in existence you've got to bypass that and go all the way back and to think about the mind mankind has been able to take the mind and do marvelous things why the Bible said you got to put them out he said because nothing is withholding from the imagination of man's mind look at them now this message is striking the Philippines exactly 12 hours because we're talking about the other day but you know what it's live right there 12 hours difference in time but yet it's live you explain that explain all of the mechanical things that they have been able to come up with because of the human mind the Bible says nothing's withholding from the prophet of God said it like this one day he said man has broken into God's laboratory amen you remember that one broken into God's Laboratory with the mind you can actually there's people that can actually Bend metal with their mind it's all that's foolishness no it's not with the mind you know that they're teaching them now and I'm sure they're Way Beyond that because once they tell you they're doing something they're already above that right but it was yours this had been 10 years ago I guess or more that they were talking about an airplane and connected into your brain and flying that airplane by your brain because see if you're flying like this and an enemy comes in over here or bombs coming your way it takes a split second for you to make that connection between the hand and the eye and the coordination and they've been teaching that for for 10 years or more to hook it up to your brain and fly by it because see in that way everywhere you look is where the plane would go the mind of man but then my Bible says what God's thoughts are higher than your thoughts God's ways are higher than our ways so whatever they can do did you read in the paper the other day or that they are now releasing a section of land out there or telling you about it it exists track 51 I believe it is that do you read it some are shaking their head yes and you know what they're dealing with and they've been dealing with was UFOs Stouts bombers millions of acres of land that no one is allowed to go in we're just seeing the trash cans of what the world knows about that the mind has been able to do it was in the paper the other day about it's coming up to a certain time that Francis Powers remember the U2 pilot was shot down I believe in 62 over Russia evidently must have been a lucky shot because that plane was more sophisticated than those stelks bombers that went into Kuwait back 10 years ago what we talk about now on these military guys can tell you that's that's junk pile stuff told you they had a watch a watch entire in the year 1900 that could take pictures we life about get smart and the guy that had the telephone in his shoe you know and all of the things he used to go to the old Buck Rogers movies and they had raygons and interplanatory travel and the ability to do all kind of and they've got it now because of the mind of man but yet God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts to go back into the mind of God is not to get a spaceship and try to fly backwards we used to read about time machines warp machines wonder how much they're doing on it oh that can't be done well if you can fly from here there and get there before you start here that's pretty close right I know that's hours difference I know what you're talking about but I also know that what would happen if you proved too fast they go so fast and you break through a sound barrier and there's no limits to the plane the mind of man but to be able to go back by way of a prophet into the mind of God where all of these things we see come from because of that you say well you believe in UFO no don't believe in UFOs I've done told you over and over don't believe in UFOs I believe in inter-terrestrial beings not extraterrestrial that might not be the way to explain it to pronounce the word but it gets the point across brother random said in 1955 said Russia had flying saucers jet airplanes and flying saucers we knew they had had airplanes because they've captured them from the Germans he said they had flying saucers what a wonderful thing to be able to think about by way of a prophet you see why I love this message why I believe it why I hate to see people that want to say he was wrong here and he was wrong there I'd like to see that person go tell Einstein how to make atomic bomb that's as dumb as you could think about well I know how to work up from wires and put you over here to make that switch work turn this light on I won't talk to you because I think I could help you yeah but we can't help God either but by listening to a prophet as he explains things we can be able to get a picture of what that is right you with me look at number five and what he says this is taken from the message does God change his mind recent 1965 427 but you see God the great spirit the father in him was attributes and these things that you see displayed now is just his attributes being displayed he dwelt alone he was not even God was an object of worship he was the great Eternal one and in him was attributes not with him in him drawing that line back up of what we're talking about and what you're over this way you're talking about with him were you with him before the foundational world Jesus told the disciples said I was with you you stay on that line over this way you can talk about with him I don't want to talk about with him I want to talk about anything I want to talk about that when he dwelt alone the eternal life that I have is not was a part of that life and was with him I said it the way I mean it a minute the way I said it I said the eternal life that I have now inside of me okay and then him was attributes such as to be father to be savior to be healer and now how could he first he had to be father because it proves he was father but he dwells alone he alone is immortal and now but his attributes has to be displayed now to be a savior there has to be something lost go ahead and run it upward make sure they get it and God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeem it okay solves that problem to me what did you think about it that he came purposely make something lost and redeem it you can't do it look what he said and God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeem it it wouldn't be becoming to his holiness in his great judgment why because he would be choosing he would be choosing see and that would be not right lined up with his Holiness because in Holiness is that he wants everybody to be saved that's his holiness in his great judgment that's you he just said he can't make you wrong and judge you it wouldn't be correct would he put man on three more agency knowing that knowing that man would fall and in that he became man himself in order to redeem back man that fell that's the reason that Jesus was Emmanuel if God sent another person besides himself then that wouldn't be just God had to come himself and take place and God could not be come down in spirit and take place he had to be made flesh In the Flesh of his own creative son and he showed here in the beginning that his perfect will was to create Man Out of the Dust of the Earth perfect will no you think of how close we are perfect will the fall is permissive will but by his permissive will of letting us fall we're going to come back to his perfect will if not what do you want are you women he showed here in the beginning that his perfect will was to create Man Out of the Dust of the earth he done that with Adam right but you see he permitted sex to be brought he never did intend children to be born by sex but it was permitted which soon will fade away what about God dwelling alone look at the next one let me get this one let's see no hold on let's just hold that let me get one run over to number 10 please we'll drop back on these Sunday we'll come back to go run over to number 10. paragraph 46. 47 48 who is this Melchizedek we'll get this one and quit and the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes now like that he dwelt alone with his attributes see I believe in eternal life and that eternal life says together is a part of God there is no life outside of that right and then we are his attributes that have eternal life there's where the problem is we must receive eternal life he was born with eternal life it's no need of a savior as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts now where do we get back there these attributes is his thoughts and show you his thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts uh let's see what's his name uh the colleague what's your boy's name I done forgot my run now Myron and and then her brother Colleen and sister Ruth they never sat down and thought about Myra right that's right Brother Anderson sister Anderson did y'all sit down and think about oh yeah you thought about having a baby you thought about you know a name for it but that's not the way God thinks his thoughts is eternally can't have another one all right what that's his thoughts there was nothing but God alone but he had thoughts just like now what she explained here like an architect designing it then we'll get one where he said it's not like an architect and that's both times right because of what he's explaining just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks it's it's his if he is going to build create now he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it in a different form because God is the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then your word is a thought what's a thought when it's expressed as a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's God's attributes then it become a thought than a word we'll come back over these but I want to end it with brother Brown says in the seal book he said first it was God's thought he said it's not a word all right he said it was given to John because he goes back to Moses and the things because where do we get down with Moses on the writing of the Bible he said it's not a word yet it's still a thought he said but then when it's spoken it becomes a word now Sister Gail when you were standing there in the kitchen cleaning and all at once something dropped down and just for a second he said where's God see that was your thought now what if you'd have never spoke that to us we could have never known what you were thinking you see one day you told us about that see it went from a thought two word and see that's what happened with Martin Luther no telling them how many times come on musician don't tell them how many times Martin Luther preached on the just you'll live by faith but one day something clicked a thought that's me and then he went and spoke it the showing that it was not a thought to others someone went out and burnt down Church buildings and destroyed places and done all kinds of things because they thought that's what he meant they never got to thought first is God's thought then it becomes a word Abraham said I'll give you a tenth Lord of all and again he picked that thought out of heaven because you think about it I'll get back on the point you think about it How could a man write what happened in Genesis to be recorded in the Bible of what happened to Genesis he went beyond his own mortal thinking into the thoughts of God back in the back part of God's mind back into his subconscious Faith lays in your subconscious is that a quote you say mama Faith that's our problem we got it out here I believe it by shots I'm Healed it's out here oh I can tell you all the scriptures I give you all the quotes I forgive me folks for being honest but you you can get tapes the word right around them it's prayer lines prayer lines prayer lines prayer line wonderful thank God but that's not going to heal you it may think make you think into the direction to where you can be healed amen but the quotes and the things not going to heal you the Bible says thus saith the Lord you're healed why are we not healed because it's right out here in the front part of our brain and our conscious part would you let it drop back in out of that subconscious and you'll walk out and say doc it's all done it's all finished let's stand what we got 48 in the black notebook number 48. I bless your name Amen in prisoners begin to sing right they went land back there being also pitiful about how bad they felt beating and everything but yet they were letting our praising God and singing God bless your name I get up in the night uh just walk through the house and you're singing sometimes it's just the same verse over and over just singing why because I love good music now mine's bad but I'm just glad God can hear all languages and understanding my hope reach out and reach out and anybody having to eat in Jesus name bless your name I bless your name I'll give you the truth away foreign if you pray that's your name we bless your name imprisoners chain in prisoners chain with pleadings rhymes into the day and he needs prayer about that but I guess most of you heard you probably listening while ago that his son Andy had a stroke so let's just pray that God will reach down and just touch him straighten that up and make everything be all around all right and Blake remember to pray for brother Al's hand because he bummed it up father we love you Lord we thank you you are the Healer you're the deliverer Lord here's your opportunity to display your healing virtues you're not going there and touching Andy Lord just make all things because we believe we thank you just reach down and touch our brother's hand your lord and make all well with it father take away the pain no problems we love you father just remember that little child Out Center yes Lord Lord reached down in Jesus anybody else in your mind reach out and just Reach Out traveling we bless you you dismissed father just be with everybody foreign we bless your name we
