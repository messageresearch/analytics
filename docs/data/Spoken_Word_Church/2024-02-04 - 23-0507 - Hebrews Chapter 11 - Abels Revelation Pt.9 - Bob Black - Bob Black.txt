========================================

morning and God bless you it's good to be it's good to be back we had a wonderful time uh fellowshipping with the Saints up there brother Andre's little church and uh he sends his greetings back and uh and uh we sure I sure I was listening to all the services and everything working in the yard yesterday and I sure enjoyed brother John's Sunday school lesson and uh and and brother Willie Smiley I I really enjoyed that thinking about brother brother John uh his Sunday school lesson there's there's so many things you know if you if if you make the wrong decisions it sure and in your natural life it can sure make uh things a lot more difficult if you make good sound decisions it can make things a lot easier so it's uh anything we can do to make our natural Journey a little bit easier I'm I'm in favor of it now to get things started this morning uh I I I just wanted to read a couple of quotes and then we'll read our scripture um just CU you know Hebrews 11 is is speaking about faith and uh and you you think about what faith faith really is is we got our natural senses and and uh to be able to contact this natural world but God has given us another sense to be able to contact the things that we can't see it's like a like a little antenna that you can you can know that that God's here in the building that you can know whether somebody's preaching right doctrine that you can know um looking beyond the things that you can see that you can know um that God is able to to bring things to pass that he promised and there in a super sense he said the six Sense come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to God's word now let's kind of think about this in the context of what we're studying on Abel and Enoch and and all the ones that are laid out in uh Hebrews 11 uh that that they're looking by Faith by faith in en knew to build the Pyramid and Enoch walked with God and by faith Noah built an ark the six sense uh gives you to to make the five senses and you deny anything that's contrary to God's word that's what the six sens is for the scripture speaks of casting down reasonings the five senses well you can reason well now why should this man and why should but the six sense doesn't see that at all oh think about that the six sense doesn't see the circumstances and so forth at all it's so far beyond it it's so much higher than it is until it don't even have any reasonings at all with it we believe it it's far beyond anything that the five senses would have to say about it now get ready for a healing service see we believe it you walk by that six sense you talk by that six sense you live by that six sense you die by that six sense and Rise by that six sense that super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is and in the unity of one God in the one church he said now what your eyes tell you what your mind thinks you I can't quit it I can't do it I can't stop doing this that's intellectual but something down in your heart says and you are my property remember listen to what your voice in the heart says because it's God speaking to you all of the things will fade just like the night has to fade which is the strongest the night or the day let the sun rise and see what happens to the night it just Fades and can be no more and now let's get to our scripture Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning Lord and as we as we study these things out I pray that you'll guide us through these scriptures to give us a greater understanding of what we can do with our faith and what faith was given for and God that you've given all these promises to us and I pray God that you'll just bless brother Wade as he's prepared pray and Lord back there Lord that you'll help us help our hearts Lord Jesus and that you'll Lord fill the Liberty Lord to be among us today Grant it Lord in your name so Hebrews 11 verse4 says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yet speaketh and we'll uh uh Lord will will kind of make some good progress today and and hopefully move on to verse 5 but you you kind of dive into this scripture a little bit and you find out that the faith Abel had um that God actually come behind it and and testified of his gift that it was correct and that faith that was in him the life that that he lived actually began to even spoke beyond the grave that it still be continued to speak and and Paul's seeing that saying here that he be by being dead yet speaketh that his testimony still lives on today that he was right and will examine these things now the reason that he kind of lay in the background again that the reason why he offered up animal animal life was because he had a revelation that the problem was life and brother Ram said in law or Grace he said see what kind of a blood was that shed animals blood animal life for a human life it just can't take away sin can't now when Jesus come it wasn't only human's life but it was God's own life himself that what was it that's what was in his blood now the reason why we we labor labor life so much I I'll read a quote here in a minute where where where brother R said the evidence of a real revelation of God is that you got the life is on display what happened when when Abel believed that God come down and Vindicated that and you see the life actually becomes a Vindication that your Revelation is correct cuz some something's happening in your life when when Cain saw that Abel's ael's Revelation was Vindicated you know you think about God coming down with fire and consuming that sacrifice off the altar that Cain could look at that and say well something Supernatural is taking place and all these all these messages where brother Brown laid out for us this something Supernatural and God comes down and vindicates your life vindicates your Revelation with a changed life where somebody can look at you and see that God is God is living in God's done something for you that you ain't like you used to be and see that's that's what it all comes down to the life when somebody can see the Life of Christ in you that the fruit FRS are on display there's there's a real Vindication and in expectation he said tonight with our Throne blessings in our heart by his grace to know that we were Sinners and he came and took our place and died as a sinner died in my place he died my death at Calvary he died all our deaths at Calvary and the sin me as a sinner he represented me in his death at Calvary he represented every believer tonight in his death at Calvary and God reconciling us and his love to us raised him up again for our justification and then the message law he said now a beautiful type of the believer today coming believing laying his hands upon Christ's head now look how he's talking about a Believer changed there at the altar or in his seat wherever he meets Christ laying his hands upon him at Calvary and realizing that all that Agony and suffering belongs to you and in your soul deep regrets and sorrow comes with your hands upon him you are changed you'll never never be the same it's taken the condemnation away from you he under the law being a shadow the man went away Justified but still with the same desire now back there in the Old Testament went away with the same desire but in the New Testament because why because of life not animal life or man's life but God's life God's life God's life applied to you will have an effect in you he said let's say he was caught committing adultery and he offered a lamb and the lamb died in his stead he went right right back out of the building with the same desire in his heart he come in with for the blood of bulls and goats says the scripture would not take away sin for it was only a type or a shadow of things to come because the life and the blood cell of the dying animal The Substitute was only the life of an animal but in this case here it is in this case it was not only the life of human but it was the life of God God the perfect one who came into the womb of the virgin in the form of the Holy Spirit the Creator himself boiling up in a blood cell he had no earthly father Mary was not touched by man she was a virgin and God himself overshadowed her or other words the Immaculate Conception that God himself created a blood cell what are you talking about this morning brother Bob I'm talking about why Abel why Abel offered a lamb cuz he knew the problem was life he knew that the reason why they uh were were dying was because life got messed up and and uh you see that I'm just going to kind of skim over some of these notes just to kind of save time time but Satan injected into the human race a carnal mind a carnal birth a carnal makeup but God injected by the New Birth the antidote for all of that to straighten up your life brother R said in a blessing prophet he said bring us back to God not with an injection of Education not with an injection of religious Reformation not in the injection of some kind of man-made theology but an oldfashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost sent down from God out of heaven in a Pentecostal experience a burning out what the carnality and replacing in there the jewel as calling there of a son and daughter of God what's this got to do with Abel cuz when abble believed right then God come down with fire and consumed that sacrifice till we do that brothers and sisters we'll still have bobbed hair make up on sexy looking women and men drinking smoking and calling themselves Christians because they don't know better and in their heart that very root of carnality lays there look how in the unity of one God and the one church just to kind of kind of skim over the high points of this there's many people in that says that the Holy Spirit ain't real but he said there's tens of thousands and millions of them saying it's not so there's many enjoying the blessings of it that to show that the holy ghost is real and he says he fills you with the power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creature in Christ oh to think about about that that the Holy Ghost don't does just leave you in the situation where you are but it actually changes your life it changes you and we'll we'll we'll get into that when we look at what Enoch's Revelation how he walked off the Earth uh I I was kind of studying on uh uh which other denominations believe in a stature of perfect man and I found out that the methodists actually believe in the stature of perfect man and they use they don't call it maybe like that but they use Ephesians 4:13 that we're growing into the unity of the perfect to come to the full measure of a perfect man and they use that to speak about their doctrine of sanctification what they're really calling this is sanctification that we're growing we're growing to be more like God what what is it what is sanctification get rid of that carnal nature that God is God is changing you to be it's all based that life is that life is pushing out in you to change you from the way that you were to be more like him and that's why AEL brought that lamb and the True Vine and the false Vine brother said here come little old Lael pulling that Lamb with a spiritual Revelation that he know that it wasn't fruit that brought him out of the Garden of Eden he know it was blood and life don't lay in plants like Cain thought he could just bring some stuff that he grew in the ground but life life that the kind of life that would help Abel didn't lay in Plants it lays in blood here here he come with a little string wrapped around a grape vine around that little lamb throw him up there and said this is it Lord now now see when you come we when you come to God with a real revelation of what his word is and you lay that before the Lord and prayer and say you said it and I I I know what you're talking about and you come believing and it's real genuine faith God will come by behind that like he did with Abel and he'll vindicate it and prove it oh he he'll bring it up off the page and man manifest it in your life and a real genuine manifestation of the supernatural power of God now now that's why life life don't lay in Plants it's blood that's why Christ had to die on the cross that's why that's why sitting here this morning we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus sitting there talking to Nicodemus and Nicodemus was looking at it from a faise fa Pharisee perspective that just trying to understand things from an intellectual perspective but Jesus told him that which is born of the flesh is flesh we we got to get away from the carnality the carnality of our original birth the carnality of the way that we think but that which is born of the spirit is spirit Spirit the spirit the life of God will change you and he said Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again you need the life of God to change the way that we think think to change the way that we we walk and that we talk and and the unity of one God and the one Church uh brother BR said but Abel by faith chose a lamb for it was blood and life that taken it and he drug him to a rock and hammered his little throat until he bled to death God said that's righteous Abel that's right how did it come to him by Revelation not by intellectual through his heart he knew it now those quotes we read about what a six the six sense is that God give you something the ability to look Beyond uh the the natural and to to get in touch with the Supernatural and that's that's how Abel knew what to do because God revealed it to him in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 brother Ram said look over here at Jimmy Osborne and Louisville out there with that old Boogie wogy rock and roll Old Tommy rod and filth and on Sunday morning take the Bible and stand on the platform and preach what a disgrace no wonder the Bible said every table is full of vomit while we're living in a terrible day and people say oh they're very religious oh don't you know that the devil is religious don't you know that Cain was just as religious as Abel was but he didn't have the Revelation that's it he didn't have the Revelation yeah we all go to church but there is some that's got what what's the difference life somebody's got the real genuine life of God working in their heart that's the ones that's got the revelation of Jesus Christ in their heart not by shaking jumping not by joining Church church but the revelation God has revealed him now you see you think take a look at that picture of Cain and Abel coming and they're they're both we know we we kind of belabor those points they're both going to church both paying their TI both uh you know doing all the things that looks like a Christian would do but what's the difference one's got a real genuine Revelation that'll produce something and the other is just kind of going through the motions now there's the difference between just religion cuz we don't we don't want religion religion is what the phes and the Sadducees had what that that would make them say well how how can I divorce my wife and why can't why are you healing people on Sunday and just getting not having a true interpretation of what God wanted done with his word but a a a real genuine revelation will produce a Meek humble spirit of God living in a person that can deal with other people that's that can forgive and love because it's Christ on display and I were was store brother R said now Cain was was a Believer look at that Spirit what it began at where it began a religious spirit and many people today are trying to I hear ministers on the air trying to say that communism is the Antichrist oh brother I'm not a know it- all I don't want to be that way God forbid but that's pure religious ignorance communism has nothing to do with the Antichrist Spirit Jesus said in St Matthew the 24th chapter the two Spirits would be so close together it deceive the very elect if possible the Antichrist is religion not anti-religion the Antichrist the Antichrist is going to be sitting right there in church acting like a Believer and Antichrist is just so close Judas was possessed with the Antichrist spirit and walked Plum almost to Pentecost with him rejoiced shouting in the camp meetings casting out Devils preaching the Gospel Power on display shouted had great Joy but when it time come time for him to get the Holy Ghost he showed his he showed his colors what he was and what's the Holy Ghost the life of God what's the difference between Abel and Cain the life of God showed a Abel What were what was true and what was what what the true approach was it was life life is in the blood oh you think about these Pharisees I'm just I'm going to Breeze through some of these with the last few minutes of of of of Jesus you know Jesus uh he was he always dealt kindly with the ones that were follow believe in him but he would deal harshly with the religious spirit with the religious people he he had lay it on them he' kind of conk them upside their head if you say cuz religion relig where's where's the biggest problem with somebody that's religious a religious Pro person is going to stir things up a religious person will do like Cain and kill somebody will kill will kill a real belever let go around behind their back and destroy their influence and murder them that religious person is the person that Jesus always had the problem with in Matthew 12:10 Jesus he was talking to the Pharisee behold there was a man which had his hand withered and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath days that they might accuse him you think about somebody in that state of mind that would think somebody being healed uh it would would uh would would be incorrect and we'll just kind of skim through some of these Luke CH chapter 20 they washed him and sent forth spies which should feain themselves just men that they might take hold of his words so that they might deliver him under the power and authority of the governor and they asked him say master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither accept accept us thou the person of any but teachest the word of God truly is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar and no or no but he perceived their craftiness and and said unto them why tempt ye me trying to trying to lay a trap for him because they weren't really interested in whether they should pay their taxes or not they were trying to trying to get him in a fault in Mark chapter 10 and the Pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put his put away his wife and look what Jesus said for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept now there there's a good example of a religious person trying to find an example to be mean to their wife trying to find an example to kick their wife out I I've I've boy I've got a reason that I can and you know some some of y'all Old-Timers can look back and see see examples of that and different people's lives where they're trying to got a good wife or whatever somebody's trying to cook for them in their kitchen and everything but they get just the hardness of their heart they ready to just boot them out for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept but the life of God is going to make you act different the life of God will make you want to love your see there's the difference between religion religion and something real and genuine the life of God will make you want to straighten things that want you want to make you want to sit down and talk talk things over with your wife and find out how to understand one another and and and be a real genuine man or be a real genuine woman the hardness of your heart in Luke chapter 19 he said when he was come nigh even now at The Descent of Mount of Olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him Master rebuke thy disciples they didn't understand how somebody could be praising God and shouting in a good camp meeting and get excited about the word that was coming forth and seeing God fulfilling his promises and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if he should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out because what religion religion is just kind of going through the motions through an intellectual understanding not understanding but but if they those people shouting and rejoicing they had caught a revelation of what was happening in Matthew 5 verse 19 and 20 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the kingdom of heaven and look what Jesus said for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven so your righteousness has to go higher than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees now you think about the people of that day thinking man these these Pharisees and these religious people that I look up to so much they they are really righteous and for Jesus to say your righteousness has to exceed the righteousness of these these people how is your righteousness going to exceed the righteousness of a good religious person by Revelation revelation of God's Word and questions and answers brother R said if you watch the spirits that come up out of Genesis and begin to raise up watch that real classical High classical Church worship look at it back Yonder in Cain look at it today comes right down and moves on down through into the Pharisees and there's two SE of them Pharisee and sadducee see moves right on out and look at it today in Catholicism and great moves like that great beautiful places but look at Abel with a little lamb Abel with his little lamb and God's provided way of dealing with sin he said here he come pulling the little lamb the lamb knowing that death laid near him pulling back I wonder what kind of a death that was when this little fell knowed he was coming and he laid him upon the rock pulled back back his head he perhaps didn't have any knives or lances then so they just took a sharp Rock and began to chop on his Little Neck did you ever hear a lamb die you hear the most pathetic cry you ever heard when you hear a lamb dying anyways they beat him across his little jugular veins with this rock and the blood spurting out bathing his little wool God looked down and said that's it what did it speak of it spoke of some 4,000 years later when the Lamb of God was hang Hing on the Rock of Ages and the judgments of God of The Sinner Man was hanging there and his bloody locks tripping around his shoulder speaking Abel couldn't understand what the lamb was saying and Jesus when he died spoke in an unknown tongue my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me he was God's lamb dying on the altar the innocent for the guilty God dealing with sin in that manner nothing at all you can do God has already did it you have to accept it and by Sovereign Grace believe it and God will vindicate your faith by giving you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what happened when not not the baptism of the Holy Ghost that a God gave Abel but God certainly Vindicated his faith and we'll stop on this brother said in the message presuming what was the difference as the musicians come what was the difference in Moab up on the mountain with seven altars and seven Rams and Israel down in the valley with seven altars and seven rounds but both of them keeping the Commandments of God both of them trying to do it but God Vindicated Israel how did Cain when he made an altar just as pretty or prettier than Ables he offered fruits he gave his tithes he brought his income into the house of the Lord he knelt on the altar he bowed himself he prayed he worshiped just as sincere as any man but God Vindicated Able by consuming his sacrifice God Vindicated Abel's Faith something Supernatural took place and we'll stop on that note God bless you
