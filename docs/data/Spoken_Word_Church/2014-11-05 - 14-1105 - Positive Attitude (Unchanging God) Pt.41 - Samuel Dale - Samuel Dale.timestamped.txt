[4:08] sins and cleanse us from all
[4:10] unrighteousness in Jesus name
[4:14] amen
[4:16] Malachi 3
[4:19] will start with verse 2.
[4:22] but who may abide today of his coming
[4:26] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[4:28] now remember we're down here in the end
[4:31] in the coming and appearing being two
[4:33] different things but he's appearing now
[4:36] so we ought to at least be able to
[4:37] relate to that
[4:38] all right and it says and who shall
[4:40] stand when he appeareth for he is like a
[4:43] Refiner's Fire and like Fuller soap and
[4:46] he shall sit as a refiner and purifier
[4:48] silver he shall purify the sons of Levi
[4:51] and purge them as gold and silver that
[4:54] they
[4:55] may offer unto the Lord an offering in
[4:57] righteousness
[5:00] then shall the offering of Judah and
[5:01] Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as
[5:04] in the days of old and as in former
[5:06] years
[5:07] I will come nearer to you to judgment
[5:10] and I will be a swift witness against
[5:12] the sorcerers and against the adulterers
[5:15] and against false swearers and against
[5:18] those that oppress the hireling in his
[5:20] wages the Widow and the fatherless and
[5:23] that turn aside to stranger from his
[5:25] right and fear it not me saith the Lord
[5:28] of hosts now once for I am the Lord I
[5:32] change not
[5:33] now watch therefore you sons of Jacob
[5:36] are not consumed now he's just not
[5:39] saying that I'm I'm God and I change not
[5:42] you know he puts it to them fact that if
[5:46] he changed they'd be consumed
[5:48] so you ought to remember that to all of
[5:49] us if he don't keep his word
[5:53] what good is it
[5:56] right if he changes what good is it
[5:58] right all right Hebrews 13 7 remember
[6:02] them which have the rule over you who
[6:05] have spoken unto you the word of God
[6:06] whose Faith father considering the end
[6:09] of their conversation now once we read
[6:11] Hebrews 13 8 but we don't do number
[6:13] seven to go with it see whose Faith
[6:17] father considering the end of their
[6:19] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[6:22] yesterday today and forever you may be
[6:24] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[6:26] reading of the word
[6:29] now
[6:31] you'd say well
[6:33] brother Dale
[6:35] I wrote this down where I'd remember it
[6:39] do you think your conversation
[6:43] that means manner of conversation that
[6:45] means manner of life
[6:47] in other words everything involved
[6:49] Doctrine uh living uh
[6:54] talking you know and all
[6:58] uh do you think
[7:00] that
[7:02] what you do try to do and preach or
[7:04] whatever is the same as the Bible says
[7:07] in Hebrews 13 8.
[7:12] I'm trying
[7:14] I'm trying very very very hard
[7:17] to be just that
[7:20] and to be that sure
[7:22] of the word of God
[7:24] that's that's the way I stand that's
[7:26] what I've always stood for amen I've
[7:28] always tried to believe this message as
[7:30] being something personal
[7:33] to you and I
[7:34] to not just be a Doctrine an idea or a
[7:37] concept or or some doings I've always
[7:41] believed it to try to bring us closer to
[7:44] Jesus Christ than ever and I've made
[7:46] myself clear about even today when
[7:49] they're trying to say brother random was
[7:50] wrong here and wrong darn this that and
[7:53] the other
[7:53] well there's one thing about it this
[7:56] message has led me to Jesus Christ
[7:59] so thy glory in that
[8:02] you know of what has been brought to me
[8:05] and then I'm not worried about the other
[8:07] parts
[8:08] I just you know we this is no new thing
[8:11] we've been there and I told you about it
[8:13] see that back in the 70s they come up
[8:15] with a lot of different things well back
[8:17] then you had a lot of the old people of
[8:19] the message a lot of the church people
[8:21] of the message were staunch enough to
[8:23] look at this young generation of peoples
[8:26] and and the people and tell them say
[8:28] just shut up we don't care nothing about
[8:31] talking about it he's led us to Christ
[8:33] we see now it's not dark
[8:36] so now they're just running wild about
[8:39] the message we're trying to show what
[8:42] this is and that is I told Brother Ernie
[8:44] the other day we were talking about that
[8:45] one what is it
[8:47] um the sign
[8:49] I believe the sign I said I'd at least
[8:50] take that believe off you know I mean I
[8:54] he said well I've thought about contact
[8:55] or something like that they ought to
[8:57] take that off
[8:59] because I believe
[9:01] the truth of the hour and I believe if
[9:04] he is has or ever will be God
[9:08] he's the same now we change
[9:11] right we are human beings we change
[9:14] but yet God's word don't change
[9:16] but now God by his word not changing our
[9:21] conversation
[9:24] should never change
[9:26] right you know I mean are they going to
[9:28] come along now and talk you out of what
[9:30] you believe
[9:32] you know are they going to deprogram you
[9:35] you know
[9:36] and try to get out of you what you
[9:39] believe
[9:40] would you be able to
[9:43] see
[9:46] so what are we doing
[9:49] that's what I've tried my best to be
[9:51] plain to you and tried to speak about a
[9:54] positive attitude because I'm telling
[9:56] you right now you me every one of us
[10:01] you me every one of us
[10:06] will fall for Satan's lie
[10:10] if we don't have
[10:12] a personal revelation
[10:15] a positive revelation
[10:20] a positive attitude
[10:23] about God's word oh no we never will
[10:27] well you want to take the rest of the
[10:29] night and start naming just click on
[10:31] that catch the sign things and just see
[10:33] how many of these preachers that got up
[10:35] and preached it they'd never turn
[10:37] against this message
[10:40] well you know somebody ordered to speak
[10:42] to him and tell them that you're a bunch
[10:43] of liars
[10:45] and somebody got you out with a
[10:47] hamburger
[10:49] or a hot dog one
[10:51] because they got you away from the truth
[10:53] all right
[10:54] but see then that's just you know
[10:58] but that's not nothing to do with you
[11:00] and I no amen that's true what everybody
[11:04] does has nothing to do with you and I
[11:08] it's a personal experience with Jesus
[11:11] Christ
[11:13] it's got to be that way see it's got to
[11:16] be something real all right
[11:19] now
[11:21] do you think I I still want to stay on
[11:23] Hebrews 13 8.
[11:25] for a little bit then we'll go into the
[11:27] thought for tonight of how that God does
[11:30] not change because I believe that
[11:32] relates to that
[11:33] but but do you believe that
[11:37] you know you could you could go out and
[11:39] you could ask
[11:41] um
[11:41] anybody religious
[11:44] any religious form
[11:46] and say do you believe Hebrews 13 8
[11:50] has to be the word of God
[11:56] now how many people would you think
[11:57] outside of the Freaks and Fanatics and
[12:00] idiots
[12:01] you know
[12:03] how many do you think would say no I
[12:05] don't believe that
[12:08] that said I swear by that
[12:10] that's just as much as John 3 16.
[12:16] but said then you see you then you would
[12:19] try to say well explain it to me
[12:23] well in their explaining to you what
[12:26] they think of Hebrews 13 8.
[12:30] uh
[12:32] look what's come up in the message
[12:35] Two Souls Two Lords seven Thunder versus
[12:38] Etc et cetera et cetera et cetera River
[12:40] Jordans all kind of doctrines
[12:42] do they believe Hebrews 13 8
[12:46] I say no
[12:50] but who are you I'm me who are you
[12:53] solve a problem
[12:56] I say what I believe
[12:59] you ought to be able to say what you
[13:01] believe
[13:03] now
[13:05] but my point is
[13:08] people would try and watch it because
[13:10] that's what I was trying to get across
[13:11] the last time we're speaking on Hebrews
[13:13] 13 8.
[13:15] that
[13:16] see people's actions and reactions
[13:22] will determine whether or not they
[13:24] really believe Hebrews 13 8 to be right
[13:27] yours mine all of our actions and
[13:30] reactions you know
[13:32] will
[13:34] prove
[13:35] whether we rarely Believe It or Not amen
[13:38] and remember now
[13:40] if we can show
[13:42] that he's not the same
[13:48] do you realize what people are doing
[13:49] with that
[13:51] if you can show that he's not the same
[13:57] then the rest of God's word is incorrect
[13:59] also
[14:02] because you wouldn't know what to
[14:04] believe
[14:05] you know right
[14:09] all right
[14:10] see then watch the actions and reactions
[14:13] or watch people trying to explain
[14:18] and as they try to explain see you'll
[14:21] see that they are not believing him to
[14:23] be the signing
[14:25] yes but he just don't do today like he
[14:27] used to do
[14:28] you don't believe he's Hebrews 13 9.
[14:34] explain
[14:36] I mean come on
[14:38] well it only was only 12 Apostles
[14:45] is that a great church teaching
[14:48] me nobody else got the Holy Ghost for
[14:50] Tim 12.
[14:53] well we're quick to say that's wrong
[14:58] and to use the rest of the scriptures to
[15:00] back it up to show that that's an
[15:02] incorrect statement
[15:05] but then we come over to the day and we
[15:08] say
[15:09] but he don't heal like he used to
[15:17] she will say that well
[15:20] brother Branham had great signs and
[15:22] wonders but we're we don't see that no
[15:24] more
[15:27] well then God changed somewhere
[15:30] I'm honest now you you get upset with me
[15:32] do what you want to about the way I
[15:34] State thing I just try to tell the truth
[15:36] to you because I'm trying to save your
[15:38] soul and mine too
[15:41] if you think that God is not the same
[15:43] today as he was when the prophet was
[15:45] here
[15:47] now I've explained that over and over
[15:49] we're not looking for no one person
[15:52] Ministry no sir Ray
[15:55] but the ministry of Jesus Christ is
[15:57] around the world
[15:59] in a many-membered body or else you're
[16:02] saying God changed
[16:06] see we're quick to explain that in the
[16:08] days of Luther they didn't have the
[16:10] great things that they had on the day of
[16:13] Pentecost
[16:16] that might be true
[16:19] but you know it was the cause of it was
[16:22] the people
[16:24] of the day
[16:26] all right did that change God
[16:33] come on
[16:34] that's all the simple I was trying to
[16:36] explain did that change God
[16:40] you remember how we were dealing with
[16:42] with and we'll get to some quotes here
[16:44] in a minute about it
[16:45] about positive you know partial to
[16:48] perfect realizations
[16:50] brother Brandon would use negative to
[16:52] positive
[16:53] but just remember
[16:55] brother random is negative
[16:58] is a very positive
[17:00] because there's no such thing in God as
[17:02] a negative
[17:07] we want to come up and say well and try
[17:10] to justify and say well really it's
[17:11] supposed to be partial realization to
[17:13] perfect
[17:14] why you don't have to explain it
[17:20] you don't have to explain it because to
[17:22] me negative
[17:26] we've got an electricians sitting right
[17:27] back there you know that negative is
[17:30] more positive than all your positives
[17:35] you think it ain't right pull it off
[17:41] your electric lights all the things
[17:43] won't work without the negative but that
[17:45] negative
[17:46] is a very positive outfit
[17:51] you understand what I was trying to get
[17:52] at
[17:55] see even in Luther's day yes they were
[17:57] not the great signs and wonders may be
[17:59] following
[18:00] but that didn't change God
[18:03] he was positive then he's always been
[18:07] positive he's never been negative
[18:09] there's no negative to it
[18:13] you're not correcting brother Branham
[18:15] was right
[18:19] it goes from negative to positive amen
[18:24] amen but just remember the most negative
[18:27] of negative of negative of God is a very
[18:30] very positive of all positives
[18:35] right
[18:37] right see that's all I've tried to
[18:39] explain
[18:42] see another way I believe the ministry
[18:44] of Jesus Christ is around the world in
[18:46] the bride of Christ
[18:48] foreign
[18:50] artists don't see it
[18:55] then you're saying God is wrong
[18:58] then you're saying God changed his mind
[19:00] somewhere
[19:02] you can't quote Hebrews 13 8 that he's
[19:04] the same yesterday today and forever
[19:07] you can't say that so the rest of your
[19:09] Bible is wrong see why it relates to
[19:11] that it doesn't say his manner of
[19:14] conversation about uh this or that or
[19:17] the other or what it says his manner of
[19:20] conversation
[19:23] and said you check it out to see whether
[19:25] it's Hebrews 13 8.
[19:31] because see there can't be any
[19:32] negativism
[19:38] but remember now my point y'all keep
[19:40] making it
[19:41] the most negative point that you could
[19:44] ever find in God would be is part more
[19:48] powerful and positive than all of the
[19:50] things that we can think about
[19:58] then why would we let things you know
[20:01] into our minds of people to make doubt
[20:04] coming along
[20:09] well he just don't do today like he used
[20:11] to do
[20:15] I want you to do it safe as far as I'm
[20:16] concerned
[20:18] as far as I see it
[20:20] now you gotta hope
[20:22] but if you're saying that he doesn't do
[20:24] it then you're saying God's wrong
[20:29] yes but I've just never seen anything
[20:31] outside of brother Brown's meat amen
[20:34] that was God's Gift in place and doing
[20:36] right
[20:38] more in one service than Jesus in the
[20:41] whole
[20:42] or even more in one service I'll say it
[20:44] for a long self then all of the things
[20:46] in the book of Acts
[20:48] of the accounts or the healings and the
[20:51] signs and wonders and read around them
[20:52] in one service
[20:55] it would be more signs and wonders than
[20:57] that
[21:00] all right
[21:08] all right
[21:10] so now you're back to what used to be
[21:12] said years ago
[21:14] said all God was he poured into Christ
[21:18] oh Christ was born in brother Branham
[21:21] he died and took it with him and we
[21:23] ain't got nothing
[21:32] but you see that's not the damaging part
[21:38] it's not the damaging part of the people
[21:41] who are related back to thinking about
[21:43] brother Branham and the ministry and the
[21:46] signs and expecting him to come back and
[21:47] the things that their way that's not no
[21:49] damage in effect
[21:54] the damaging effect is you and I
[21:57] where Satan can enter our minds
[22:01] and try to talk to us about God's word
[22:08] that's that's why I'm sorry I know that
[22:12] I've always been strong and hard about
[22:14] things
[22:15] because to me there's no gray area in
[22:17] God
[22:21] there's no small amount of God
[22:25] the smallest amount of God is the
[22:27] greatest of anything that we could think
[22:29] of
[22:31] all right
[22:35] but you see we let those things enter
[22:38] our mind
[22:42] and that's what's killing us
[22:44] remember back a few weeks ago a few
[22:46] months ago or something and I was
[22:48] preaching about death and what it was
[22:52] and to death to be our interpretation of
[22:55] God's word
[22:57] which is contrary to the truth
[23:01] our thoughts
[23:03] we're not brother Dale don't you think
[23:05] that that that that brother has a right
[23:07] to believe what he wants to believe yeah
[23:09] I sure do
[23:11] goats couldn't believe all they won't do
[23:15] sheep can't do it
[23:20] sheep can only follow God's word
[23:26] but you see there's nothing negative
[23:31] it can't be anything negative
[23:35] well there you're straight now brother
[23:37] random I ain't straighten it out I'm
[23:39] saying what he says so let's read what
[23:41] he says
[23:43] okay sister said the other day he said
[23:46] somebody said brother Dale said he said
[23:49] something and said I'm sitting there
[23:50] saying my friend didn't say it said he
[23:52] posted up on the screen let me read it
[23:55] well
[23:56] all right look what he said on Abraham
[23:59] preached in 1956 1208 e14 which is the
[24:03] number one on the notes let's just think
[24:06] about it
[24:10] all right
[24:15] showing Abraham's election God calls Man
[24:17] by election for knowledge no man can
[24:19] come to me except my father draws him
[24:22] first
[24:24] all that comes I'll give them eternal
[24:26] life and raise him up at the last days
[24:28] that settles him I'm so happy to know
[24:31] this one thing friend
[24:33] that Christian Christianity has no
[24:36] negative nothing to it
[24:47] then come back to this
[24:52] right
[24:54] look
[24:56] now Christianity has no negative nothing
[24:58] to it it's everything absolutely
[25:00] positive
[25:02] a man that becomes a child of God has a
[25:05] positive hold on Calvary and Calvary has
[25:09] a positive hold on him with the
[25:11] Assurance by almighty God by an oath to
[25:14] himself
[25:15] that he will raise him up in the last
[25:17] days to take him to Glory
[25:20] there's not no if or and or nothing
[25:24] it's something that's positive
[25:29] all right
[25:30] look at the next one here he him verse
[25:33] 56 12 15.
[25:35] 11.
[25:38] you talking about
[25:40] my stripes chastisement of our peace
[25:42] look what he said
[25:43] everything is in past tense by stripes
[25:46] on heal you know everything's in past
[25:49] tense
[25:50] it's done done we'll read that when we
[25:52] get them down all right
[25:54] there's no negative at all in
[25:56] Christianity
[25:57] it's all positive done paid for it's
[26:00] finished amen that make method is almost
[26:03] Shout again wouldn't it think of it
[26:06] it's all completed all finished
[26:09] our only thought is not many things
[26:13] God cannot do nothing else
[26:16] it's already completed
[26:18] Christ stood right here what's now
[26:21] Christ stood right here tonight and
[26:23] you'd say Christ heal me
[26:25] what would he say
[26:27] I've already done it
[26:28] you could cry Satan what did he say
[26:30] already done it
[26:32] all right
[26:34] so then where would we have the right to
[26:35] come up in any way to think about
[26:39] right
[26:42] well I'll tell you what I thought don't
[26:44] you think I got her no if you're a
[26:46] Christian
[26:47] you don't have a right to think
[26:52] well you're just trying to make us think
[26:53] what you think
[26:57] well am I wrong
[27:02] that's all I say
[27:05] is what I say it so far right amen
[27:09] amen that there's no negativism in God
[27:11] there's nothing negative amen
[27:14] that the greatest negative you could
[27:16] think of in Christianity is the greatest
[27:18] positive than all satan could ever come
[27:21] up with
[27:23] amen
[27:28] you remember this one I love this quote
[27:30] go ahead with number three
[27:34] proving his word in 64.
[27:37] now if you belong to a church that don't
[27:40] believe he's the same yesterday today
[27:42] and forever the same in every way
[27:46] get away from it
[27:50] you see one and I've got to believe the
[27:52] positive of all positives
[27:57] and try to teach the positive of all
[27:59] positives and the basis
[28:05] when I've tried my best to explain ever
[28:07] Doctrine
[28:09] ever thought
[28:11] ever thing that brought a random
[28:14] preached
[28:16] through the serpent seed
[28:19] the Daniel 70 weeks
[28:21] the CEOs
[28:22] the marriage in divorce
[28:26] the predestinated seeds
[28:29] you know
[28:31] predestination for knowledge
[28:37] all right
[28:39] why because
[28:42] at least I want you to know what I
[28:43] believe then if you think it's not right
[28:46] according to Hebrews 13 8 you you
[28:50] you're supposed to go somewhere else
[28:53] that's as good as I can say it I mean I
[28:55] don't want to run nobody off never have
[28:59] but if the truth runs you off what do I
[29:02] need to say
[29:04] my brother colleague's been here since
[29:06] 1971 right at your life
[29:09] you mean if there's something I could
[29:10] say to him that would cause him to leave
[29:13] you know
[29:15] well why don't you tell me what it is
[29:17] and I'll say it
[29:18] you get it
[29:20] save us all a lot of trouble
[29:23] just come and tell me to say it
[29:27] because how can you do it
[29:31] if what I preach can't let you know what
[29:34] I am
[29:35] and what I believe
[29:37] at least you don't have to worry about
[29:39] what I believe
[29:43] you know what I believe because I tell
[29:44] you right or wrong good or bad
[29:52] look at the next one
[29:57] blind Bartimaeus now the Bible says that
[30:00] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[30:01] and forever right
[30:03] and he's got to be the same in principle
[30:06] the same in power
[30:07] oh he don't have as much power today as
[30:09] he used to have
[30:11] why because people don't believe he's
[30:13] got the power he used to have
[30:20] right
[30:21] he's got to be the same in principle
[30:22] he's got to say the same in power the
[30:24] same in every way only the Corporal body
[30:27] and he's using us
[30:30] he doesn't need a Corporal body he's
[30:32] using us
[30:33] it didn't change the Hebrews 13 8 for
[30:37] him to leave in a bodily form and come
[30:39] back in a bodily form in a bride that
[30:42] made Hebrews 13 8 correct
[30:50] see Jesus don't have any hands
[30:53] but yours and mine
[30:55] see we are the what he's Divine we're
[30:57] the branches is that right Divine don't
[31:00] bear fruit the branches bear fruit is
[31:03] that right you don't take the fruit off
[31:05] the vine you take it off the branch but
[31:08] what about it
[31:10] do you believe it
[31:13] look at the next one the mighty
[31:14] conqueror
[31:18] e61
[31:21] .
[31:23] and this this Bible said that he has
[31:26] risen from the dead
[31:29] that he is the same yesterday today and
[31:31] forever
[31:33] then he's got to be the same in
[31:35] Resurrection
[31:38] he's got to be the same in power
[31:40] you've got to be the same in principle
[31:43] he's got to be the same in every way
[31:45] except a cardinal body now what was that
[31:48] interpretation of cardinal the other day
[31:50] I kept looking up trying to find out why
[31:52] he would use the word cardinal
[31:54] and I'll go ahead and
[31:57] of most important
[32:00] that's what the Cardinal part means of
[32:02] most important you say well he just well
[32:04] maybe he did but he used it two or three
[32:06] times so that's all right but it's of
[32:08] most importance
[32:11] in every way except a most important way
[32:14] of a body
[32:15] this body the Corporal body of of his is
[32:19] sitting at the right hand of God
[32:20] Almighty and Glory do you believe that
[32:22] he's sitting at the right hand of God
[32:23] Almighty and Glory make an intercession
[32:27] think about it
[32:29] now remember this one go ahead sir as we
[32:31] would see Jesus 61.
[32:33] 409 e22
[32:41] and then if Hebrews 13 8 said
[32:44] it is the same yesterday today and
[32:46] forever then he's got to be the same in
[32:48] Principle as I'm in power to sign in
[32:49] every way that he was yesterday or he
[32:52] isn't the same someone say
[32:55] he's the same in a certain way
[33:00] no
[33:01] he's the same the scripture says that
[33:05] he's the same that was is today and will
[33:08] be forever
[33:10] but he's just in a certain way
[33:13] no
[33:15] well he he don't heal like he used to
[33:19] he don't save like he used to
[33:26] I know I won't get through in time to do
[33:28] it so I'll probably after a while just
[33:31] quit
[33:32] and ask you one question
[33:37] and I want you to be thinking on it
[33:39] how many of you have been healed
[33:43] well I preach in this 41 sermons
[33:52] there's enough hands of Life the rest of
[33:55] the night
[34:00] and yet you don't believe he's the same
[34:06] if brother Branham was just here we
[34:07] could hear from God that's a gift
[34:10] but remember he says my gift quote will
[34:14] not heal you my gift cannot save you
[34:18] that's what he said
[34:21] he said it's your faith in God
[34:27] so what do you think about it
[34:30] no
[34:31] see someone said he's the same in a
[34:33] certain way
[34:35] look at the next one Jesus Christ the
[34:37] same yesterday today and forever number
[34:39] seven
[34:44] it's the same Jesus yesterday today and
[34:46] forever the same same in power same in
[34:49] manifestations
[34:52] the same in every way that he was then
[34:55] he is now are the scriptures wrong
[35:03] okay
[35:05] blessed be his name
[35:09] or the scripture is wrong
[35:15] look at the next one sir we would see
[35:16] Jesus 1961.
[35:21] Jesus said wherever two or three are
[35:24] gathered in my name they're all be in
[35:26] the midst
[35:27] and then that has to bring him in our
[35:30] presence now
[35:32] see we could stop and explain each one
[35:34] of these and spend a night on it
[35:37] then if he is here
[35:39] the invisible Christ okay
[35:45] then why can we not see him
[35:48] like those Greeks wanted to see him
[35:51] verse the same in every way except the
[35:53] Cardinal body Corporal body rather
[35:56] he's the same Christ
[35:59] all right
[36:03] well now like I said a moment ago
[36:06] he was great in this age but not great
[36:08] in that one there is a whole message in
[36:11] the church ages
[36:13] that declares him to be the same in
[36:15] every age
[36:19] so now you're going to argue with him
[36:20] about it not me
[36:22] no so let's just read two or three of
[36:25] these and then we'll get to the point
[36:26] all right go ahead with number nine
[36:28] Christ is the mystery of God reveal
[36:31] look what he said what makes it
[36:33] what was it making Jesus Christ the same
[36:36] yesterday today and forever the same
[36:38] works that Jesus did Paul did the same
[36:43] and they seen God the great father that
[36:46] had demonstrated in the burning bush
[36:48] had demonstrated it to Paul
[36:51] and here he was being demonstrated well
[36:53] now Paul is not not Paul's not God
[36:58] the God Was the Same
[37:01] right
[37:03] come on
[37:06] and he's the same in every age
[37:11] God's threefold minor yesterday today
[37:13] and forever
[37:14] what Redeemer in his church preeminence
[37:18] in his coming King and then going on
[37:21] from perfect from there
[37:24] same in every age is a man here or turn
[37:26] on the lights 19 number 10.
[37:29] 1964 turn on the lights paragraph 61-62
[37:33] a man is known by his credentials
[37:36] the credentials of the word of God
[37:39] if he is sent by the word of God and
[37:42] with the word of God same in every age
[37:45] it's always been
[37:47] you know but I just can't see it back on
[37:49] Luther and Western him and there's
[37:51] trinitarians I know that I'm the one
[37:53] that told you those are you know I'm
[37:55] quick to say those things but the God's
[37:57] the same
[38:00] people are not the same but to God's
[38:02] Society
[38:03] that's all I'm trying to explain
[38:06] see we can't live by yesterday's light
[38:09] yesterday's lightest history we know
[38:11] nothing about it
[38:13] but just remember yesterday the light to
[38:15] us is a foundation for what we believe
[38:17] in now
[38:18] right
[38:20] come on we know nothing about it you
[38:22] can't get warm today by the Sun that
[38:24] shines yesterday that's what's the
[38:25] matter with the churches today that
[38:27] what's the matter with the people
[38:29] they're trying to live by what happened
[38:31] yesterday you can't warm by painted fire
[38:34] certainly not it has no heat to it
[38:37] huh
[38:39] look at the next one a trial 1964.
[38:44] number 11.
[38:49] how can you people say
[38:51] that the apostolic age ceased
[38:55] where did you get it
[39:01] how can you people say that
[39:04] he's not the same in every age
[39:09] but you know there's people that are
[39:11] around the world teaching that
[39:14] now here's my main point okay
[39:19] if he's not the same in every way that
[39:22] he ever was
[39:27] now right now
[39:29] then what all I've read to you
[39:35] which showed it
[39:37] you know something's wrong with us
[39:42] but you see I believe he's the same
[39:44] yesterday today and forever
[39:46] I've taught it I believe it
[39:49] I believe the same God that stood before
[39:51] the foundation of the world
[39:54] as the great eternal
[39:58] condescended into
[40:01] the word
[40:03] the same God
[40:05] and says let thy be
[40:07] in that same God come on down to the
[40:10] Bible and stood on Earth
[40:15] and that same God wrote around and said
[40:17] that walked the shores of Galilee is
[40:20] here tonight
[40:29] then what about it
[40:35] how can a Vine come out and bear today
[40:37] can go out and burn orange or this day
[40:41] by our pumpkin it would have to change
[40:43] his life
[40:44] and in Malachi the third chapter God
[40:47] says I am God and I change not
[40:51] what he was then he is today and he
[40:54] always was and always will be
[41:00] taking it to Malachi 3.
[41:03] that I'm God and I change not
[41:06] what he was then he is today
[41:09] and he always was and always will be
[41:14] now the reason God does not work in ages
[41:17] and things is very simple
[41:20] it's exactly like it was when Jesus was
[41:22] here on Earth you remember he went in to
[41:25] pray for a little girl you know what he
[41:27] done he run everybody out
[41:29] you remember that
[41:32] you run everybody out
[41:34] you know that he came into a city God
[41:37] himself came into a city I'm quoting
[41:40] scripture
[41:41] and he left that City because they would
[41:45] not receive it he could not do great
[41:48] wonders in that City because of their
[41:50] unbelief
[41:52] but did that change him
[41:56] come on be sensible the same God walked
[41:58] in the city same God walked out of the
[41:59] city
[42:00] right
[42:04] it's not in your fault because God can't
[42:06] work
[42:12] he's waiting on somebody
[42:14] I was looking at them today and just run
[42:16] off a bunch of them he's waiting on
[42:17] somebody to call him on the scene
[42:20] he waiting on somebody to wake him up
[42:28] and you know what you don't have to haul
[42:30] and scream to wake him up
[42:33] you know how easy it is to wake God up
[42:37] you don't have to call him on the phone
[42:39] you know how to holler and scream you
[42:41] don't have to shout Glory Hallelujah all
[42:43] that's well and good
[42:44] all you got to do is believe what he
[42:45] said
[42:50] just believe what he's saying
[42:55] well I I believe it all but a certain
[43:06] why is the people of this message got
[43:08] tape services and things like that
[43:09] because they say they want it straight
[43:11] from the prophet
[43:13] well you know what
[43:15] I've always been blunt
[43:18] and don't mind saying that if I had to
[43:21] put up with what most of these church
[43:22] people has to put up with under their
[43:24] pastors I'd go to a tape service or
[43:27] probably just stay at home and play the
[43:28] tapes
[43:32] no problem
[43:36] because you see
[43:40] I want somebody to tell me about the
[43:43] Jesus
[43:45] in their life
[43:50] and you know how I checked out to see
[43:52] where it's right or Not by the Jesus in
[43:54] my life
[43:55] everybody remember that statement how do
[43:58] I check a Doctrine to so two Lords River
[44:01] Jordans except how do I check doctrines
[44:05] by my new birth
[44:08] well who are you I'm me who are you
[44:13] all right
[44:16] that doesn't impress me that's what
[44:18] people want to do they want to blow and
[44:20] blow it doesn't impress me
[44:24] I just go right on down the road believe
[44:25] in what I believe
[44:31] he said I'm God and I changed not
[44:36] and remember what we read there
[44:38] if not the sons of Jacob would be
[44:40] consumed
[44:42] do you realize folks what that means
[44:46] that if you in any way can show that God
[44:49] changed anywhere
[44:51] then there is no God
[44:58] I don't give a hoot what you think
[45:03] you show me where he's changed anywhere
[45:08] and we'll all go home and sit down and
[45:10] forget it because we might as well
[45:12] because there is no God
[45:17] you just don't understand brother Dale
[45:19] my God changed where'd he change
[45:27] come on I'm sorry
[45:29] don't worry about it I'm not invited to
[45:31] go preach nowhere
[45:34] and I'm to the place now that I just
[45:35] turned it down anyway why
[45:38] because I've already seen you can't
[45:40] convert people
[45:45] you can't convert people
[45:48] there's no way to convert anybody if you
[45:51] do you get them in with a hot dog you
[45:52] get them out the hamburger you can
[45:54] convert them to a doctor and somebody
[45:55] else can convert them to their Doctrine
[46:00] that's why I'm just happy to stay at
[46:02] home
[46:06] and try my best to help those
[46:08] that would listen to it
[46:11] look what he says on number 12 go ahead
[46:15] this is taken from the unchangeable God
[46:18] working in an unexpectable
[46:21] way
[46:23] we find that out that the church has
[46:26] changed and the people changes
[46:29] the road changes the scene changes the
[46:33] politics changes but there's one thing
[46:35] that does not change that's God he
[46:38] Remains the Same
[46:40] I am God and I change not
[46:43] no matter how long it is God has never
[46:47] changed one bit and he cannot change
[46:52] what a place
[46:53] the reason he cannot change is because
[46:57] he is infinite anything that's infinite
[47:00] cannot change
[47:06] anything that's infinite can change
[47:09] now are we back to some statements that
[47:11] he made
[47:13] he said God if God healed the first
[47:15] person
[47:17] he said anybody else ever reached that
[47:19] place
[47:20] they're going to have to be healed
[47:23] you know the first person that he healed
[47:25] was not a born-again Christian
[47:29] is in the Old Testament
[47:31] he said the first person that was saved
[47:34] if anybody ever reaches that same place
[47:39] he said God's obligated to save him
[47:44] we talk about the great Seed of Abraham
[47:46] what was the great Seed of Abraham a man
[47:50] that when God spoke to him he believed
[47:53] him
[47:59] he believed him
[48:03] get up
[48:05] get out of here
[48:07] you had a good living a good family a
[48:08] good everything was perfect
[48:13] where you want me to go
[48:16] wouldn't that be something
[48:20] would it be something for you to you to
[48:23] go to you daddy-in-law because that
[48:25] would have been it would have been the
[48:26] other I mean or your daddy or your
[48:29] family and you say I'm leaving well
[48:31] where are you going I don't know
[48:34] well how long it's going to take to get
[48:36] it I don't know
[48:39] well how come you're going
[48:41] because God told me
[48:44] well who's this God
[48:46] I don't know
[48:48] you ever met him no
[48:50] you ever seen him no
[48:55] come on I wish I could spend about a
[48:57] year on Abraham preaching
[49:00] man a man
[49:03] without the new birth
[49:08] believing God
[49:12] and he simply walks out with him
[49:24] has he ever spoke to you
[49:31] what about it
[49:34] go to number 13 Hebrews chapter
[49:37] 6.
[49:40] now if if we'll get down and be real
[49:43] sincere
[49:44] and really come for one purpose that's
[49:47] to learn I want to learn too the Bible
[49:50] is written said it's the scriptures are
[49:52] of no private interpretation
[49:56] that means the scripture must interpret
[49:59] scripture
[50:01] see each scripture must interpret the
[50:04] other
[50:05] all the way through the Bible
[50:08] to make it one great thing because God
[50:11] can't change
[50:13] because these he's the unchangeable god
[50:18] right
[50:20] go with the next
[50:23] God identifying himself by his
[50:25] characteristics
[50:27] there's characteristics never fails
[50:30] it always is the same
[50:33] and remember His characteristics the
[50:35] characteristics of God cannot fail
[50:38] if it does then God has failed and the
[50:41] Bible said in Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus
[50:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[50:45] forever therefore he is the unchangeable
[50:47] god
[50:48] whatever character he was at the
[50:52] beginning
[50:53] he's still that same character now stop
[50:57] there to point out where brother Brown
[50:58] said one time he said I used to think
[51:01] that Jesus loved me and God hated me
[51:04] you remember that one he said I found
[51:06] out one day they were the self-sane
[51:08] person
[51:09] right
[51:12] every way he worked anytime he ever done
[51:15] anything he does this the same way every
[51:17] time
[51:18] if he doesn't it's his character has
[51:20] changed
[51:22] me and his characteristics would display
[51:24] something that wasn't of God see so we
[51:27] wouldn't know her
[51:32] Revelations chapter 4.
[51:34] number 15.
[51:40] it must be the whole Bible not just part
[51:43] of it because God don't change what he
[51:45] was in Genesis he is today and what he
[51:47] was in the middle age he's always the
[51:49] same see now in Genesis when there are
[51:52] these cherubims that's how I come to
[51:55] find them I had to go back and to find
[51:57] out what they was at the beginning
[52:01] is that simple
[52:03] and watch what he says here on why
[52:05] Christ speak
[52:07] 1963.
[52:10] now Moses gave away to that and he said
[52:13] his faith paralyzed the world
[52:16] now you remember how that goes the story
[52:19] of Moses he was down and out but once he
[52:22] stepped out there on his faith he
[52:23] paralyzed the world with it all right
[52:25] either your faith will paralyze glamor
[52:28] or either the glamor will paralyze your
[52:30] faith
[52:33] now you have to take one or the other
[52:35] and you see the Bible don't change God
[52:37] don't change he's the unchangeable god
[52:41] so then
[52:43] what's paralyzing her
[52:46] was paralyzing you and I
[52:51] right
[53:00] I think you got it enough of it
[53:07] let me give you the life's part
[53:10] drop down to number 20.
[53:12] and we'll take that
[53:16] roll up to 20. those in between are the
[53:19] same pointings
[53:22] look what he says now this is from 356
[53:24] Church age book Lady of sin Church age
[53:27] now let me say this here I don't believe
[53:29] that God is calling only to the false
[53:32] Church to repent in this verse he's
[53:34] talking to his elect
[53:36] they have some repenting to do many of
[53:39] his children are still in those false
[53:41] churches
[53:42] now I wish you would uh
[53:47] move up just a little bit in your
[53:49] thinking
[53:50] because when he says a denomination or
[53:52] false churches you you put that in the
[53:55] Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian
[53:57] the Pentecostals uh moving on up to the
[54:00] brown of ice okay
[54:02] that's what I'm talking about okay let's
[54:04] move up to the brand of miles
[54:07] all right
[54:09] many of his children are still in those
[54:11] false churches there are those of whom
[54:13] it speaks in Ephesians 5 14 awake thou
[54:16] that sleep us and arise from the dead
[54:17] and Christ shall give thee light to be
[54:20] asleep is not to be dead these are
[54:23] sleeping amongst the dead that you
[54:25] remember Paul wanted to be raised from
[54:27] Out Among the dead remember
[54:29] these are sleeping amongst the dead they
[54:31] are out there in the dead denominations
[54:33] they're floating around with them God
[54:35] Cries Out wake up repent of your Folly
[54:37] here they are lending their influence
[54:39] giving their time and their money
[54:41] actually their life very lives to these
[54:44] Antichrist organizations and all the
[54:46] while thinking it's all right they need
[54:49] to repent they must repent they need to
[54:51] have a change of mind and turn
[54:54] toward truth yes this is the age that
[54:57] most needs to repent but will it will it
[55:00] bring back the word
[55:02] will it again enthrone the holy spirit
[55:04] in men's lives will it again Reverend
[55:07] Jesus as the only savior
[55:09] I say not
[55:16] for the next verse
[55:17] reveals just astounding and shocking
[55:20] truth of the clothes of this age
[55:23] behold I stand at the door and knock
[55:28] he's not out there knocking on them
[55:30] Church doors
[55:31] trying to get in
[55:33] that should have been out of your mind a
[55:35] long time ago
[55:37] he's knocking at our heart's door
[55:41] trying to get in
[55:43] and if he's already in there but yet
[55:45] we're tied up with all of this other
[55:47] stuff
[55:49] where are we at
[55:55] he said well what's that got to do about
[55:58] Hebrews 13 8.
[56:01] for an unchanging God
[56:09] because most people don't believe
[56:11] foreign
[56:13] even though they have the message
[56:16] they read it they they cherish it they
[56:20] like some people we knew of
[56:23] you know
[56:24] they played tapes 24 hours a day in
[56:26] their home
[56:30] but where can you get the truth to them
[56:38] right right
[56:41] am I
[56:43] arrogant sarcastic hateful
[56:46] Okay I accept all of that but is it the
[56:49] truth
[56:50] now will you accept that amen
[56:56] amen you see it's not how much we know
[56:57] about this message
[57:01] is how much of this message has been
[57:03] revealed to us
[57:12] don't you think they can have a right to
[57:14] believe sure
[57:16] billy goat oh you want to
[57:20] you believe what you want to
[57:23] that's right
[57:25] but if it ain't according to Hebrews 13
[57:27] 8
[57:30] I don't care what you believe
[57:33] and they ride
[57:35] if he's not the same in every way
[57:43] then the Bible's wrong
[57:48] and you and I have been found to be
[57:50] fooled
[57:52] to try to believe something that's not
[57:54] right
[57:58] but you know what
[58:00] I kind of believe that down through time
[58:04] has proven a lot of things about the
[58:06] word of God to be right
[58:09] I believe there's 68 million that died
[58:13] under Catholicism
[58:16] for what they believed is enough proof
[58:20] I believe all of the early church
[58:24] that were killed
[58:26] for what they believe
[58:32] you know
[58:34] have you ever thought about what they
[58:36] were doing in the Dark Ages
[58:39] you ever thought about somebody standing
[58:41] there with an animal to pull them apart
[58:43] on each end
[58:44] and the priest says all you got to do is
[58:48] is just recant your belief
[58:52] and said what I mean by that is said you
[58:55] believe Jesus don't you
[58:58] yes yeah I believe him
[59:03] were you believing to be God don't you
[59:05] yeah I believe him
[59:11] but you don't believe the way we explain
[59:13] it no
[59:18] because it's not according to Hebrews 13
[59:20] 8.
[59:25] do you understand what I'm getting at
[59:31] couldn't you just call
[59:33] class just a little bit
[59:38] you think you're the only ones got the
[59:40] truth I'm the only one that I know of
[59:42] has got it bad enough put it in the
[59:44] internet I don't worry about it
[59:48] but you know what if you can't say that
[59:50] there's something wrong with your
[59:51] experience
[59:54] that don't exalt me that exalts Jesus
[59:57] Christ
[59:58] anybody listen if you can't say you got
[1:00:01] the truth
[1:00:02] then there's something wrong with you
[1:00:04] I'm just loud and mouth smart attic
[1:00:06] enough to put it out on the internet and
[1:00:08] say come on
[1:00:10] show me where I missed it
[1:00:15] well because if I'm believing to be the
[1:00:17] same he's the same now
[1:00:23] I believe somebody's got the truth don't
[1:00:25] you
[1:00:28] I started off by saying I believe
[1:00:31] what I believe
[1:00:39] I believe what I believe not the offline
[1:00:41] statements the things that have also
[1:00:43] something that we do silly stupid stuff
[1:00:47] I'm talking about
[1:00:49] the one true and living God
[1:00:53] I'm talking about the Daniel 70 weeks
[1:00:55] the seals
[1:00:58] a minute
[1:01:00] to you out there on the internet is your
[1:01:01] pastor preached those things
[1:01:04] well now my pastor he's afraid of that
[1:01:06] he's afraid he might get confused when
[1:01:08] you go tell the old boy he already is
[1:01:11] and tell him brother Dale said that
[1:01:16] you said would you or not be that
[1:01:18] sarcastic Why Can't We Be
[1:01:23] what's the matter with you
[1:01:26] well I don't want to hurt nobody's
[1:01:27] feelings I don't either because I have
[1:01:29] feelings too
[1:01:34] but what about the truth
[1:01:38] I thought we believe the Bible said You
[1:01:40] shall know the truth
[1:01:41] I didn't know it says we shall know part
[1:01:43] truth
[1:01:49] but you see that's why I put out what I
[1:01:51] believe
[1:01:52] but the others won't tell you what to
[1:01:54] believe they'll pity better run over
[1:01:56] here they put invade around over there
[1:01:57] and a little you know
[1:02:05] but I thought truth was true I didn't
[1:02:07] know they would put one Faith one Lord
[1:02:09] one baptism one God and father of our
[1:02:12] Lord Jesus our lord Jesus Christ I
[1:02:14] thought that was what the Bible said
[1:02:20] but you see Church
[1:02:23] that's what I said to start with
[1:02:28] how many of you have been healed
[1:02:31] in the past few months
[1:02:34] there's one two three four five six
[1:02:38] seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[1:02:41] thirteen
[1:02:43] fourteen
[1:02:45] fifteen
[1:02:48] no
[1:02:54] that's been healed but yet God don't
[1:02:56] work like he used to
[1:03:02] where do you get that right to say that
[1:03:09] but you think the devil don't fight boy
[1:03:12] you know oh he's up now fighting hard
[1:03:16] sitting down in the woods in the night
[1:03:27] laying in the bed
[1:03:30] and all at once Here Comes his spirit
[1:03:36] wait I didn't tell him what went on
[1:03:38] you don't know it till now
[1:03:42] here come this spirit
[1:03:46] I couldn't breathe
[1:03:52] I couldn't move I couldn't breathe
[1:03:56] it was just so
[1:03:58] but yet I was conscious enough to know
[1:04:00] that hey I'm still breathing
[1:04:07] they just stayed there
[1:04:11] that's raised up and set up
[1:04:15] Wade had to get up and go to the
[1:04:16] bathroom
[1:04:19] I took that opportunity
[1:04:21] to slide on my clothes and
[1:04:24] and I did I told him I said I've got to
[1:04:26] go to the bathroom too
[1:04:29] we came back around and
[1:04:32] I said just go ahead inside I'm going to
[1:04:34] stay out here a little while
[1:04:38] I sat there for two and a half hour
[1:04:46] with that Spirit pressing
[1:04:50] cutting off my breathing and
[1:04:52] doing
[1:04:57] but you know what I say
[1:05:00] I said Lord
[1:05:01] let's be a good place to go from if it's
[1:05:04] over with
[1:05:08] and now I'm no fear
[1:05:11] none whatsoever
[1:05:15] I would have to breathe deep to get up
[1:05:17] to be able to breathe
[1:05:22] I sat there by the fire and just prayed
[1:05:25] and you know what
[1:05:27] I called every one of your name
[1:05:32] who said Lord
[1:05:34] take care of them
[1:05:42] it still didn't tell way nothing about
[1:05:43] it
[1:05:46] next night it was different
[1:05:51] I knew better than to move around very
[1:05:53] much
[1:05:56] so I set up on the side of the bed
[1:06:03] and you know that
[1:06:04] smothering the presence wasn't there
[1:06:09] there was another presence
[1:06:17] I called all of your names again
[1:06:21] for an hour or so
[1:06:25] I said Lord there's something wrong
[1:06:26] somewhere
[1:06:31] until you take care of it
[1:06:34] when Wade got up
[1:06:36] we got up that morning
[1:06:39] I said why did something wrong
[1:06:42] I don't know what it is there's
[1:06:44] something wrong
[1:06:45] but I've prayed about it
[1:06:49] that was a time Brother Gary
[1:06:52] was having some problems
[1:06:55] I've done that many times we wondered
[1:06:57] each one of you
[1:07:00] that when you come on my mind I pray for
[1:07:02] you
[1:07:04] because you see I believe God is society
[1:07:09] I believe he's the same now as he ever
[1:07:12] was
[1:07:13] there ain't no devil in hell can secure
[1:07:15] this man
[1:07:20] but you see our first check
[1:07:22] like I did years ago when
[1:07:25] a great pain struck me
[1:07:27] down through I've told you about it
[1:07:30] down through my rectum I did like it was
[1:07:32] ripping me to pieces and I immediately
[1:07:35] jumped up out of the bed and
[1:07:39] the devil said you went against brother
[1:07:40] so and so now you got cancer and a
[1:07:43] rectum it's going to kill you
[1:07:48] I got up went in the bathroom blood came
[1:07:52] out
[1:07:55] I stood there and I said Lord you know
[1:07:57] one thing for sure
[1:08:00] I've never had no problems
[1:08:03] with that brother or anybody else you
[1:08:05] know I love people
[1:08:07] and I want to help them
[1:08:11] no fish is my time to die let it go
[1:08:13] ahead
[1:08:14] but you know
[1:08:16] that I have no troubles
[1:08:19] three months before I tell my wife
[1:08:20] anything about it because she worries
[1:08:23] about me
[1:08:26] but you see the devil can't get you
[1:08:28] until God's truly here and when he's
[1:08:31] through with you he can get you anyway
[1:08:32] it don't matter who's there right
[1:08:36] I'm saying that there's God is still
[1:08:38] here
[1:08:40] and he's the same amen that he ever was
[1:08:45] and you that were healed
[1:08:48] you just remember
[1:08:51] a lot of times it wasn't because we
[1:08:53] prayed for you
[1:08:56] he was your faith
[1:09:00] I wish I had all not to explain that
[1:09:03] it's not how good I am or what it is but
[1:09:06] if you can believe
[1:09:10] that that person that prays for you
[1:09:12] is in contact with God
[1:09:15] will come down and heal you
[1:09:20] he'll deliver
[1:09:22] because he's unchanging
[1:09:27] but just remember don't think he won't
[1:09:29] let up on you
[1:09:35] sure
[1:09:38] I went on called the doctor and said hey
[1:09:41] can you give me something for coughing
[1:09:43] I get it about every three months anyway
[1:09:47] he
[1:09:50] sends me something
[1:09:52] I'm taking pills for it that's Glory
[1:09:54] Hallelujah
[1:09:56] thank God for healing
[1:09:58] no matter how he brings it to us
[1:10:03] but I'm just saying well some of you
[1:10:05] just like to stand up
[1:10:07] and just testify a minute
[1:10:10] about what you got we'll get to get the
[1:10:15] well I guess it's over there
[1:10:20] just
[1:10:22] tell about your healing
[1:10:25] and like I said
[1:10:26] remember
[1:10:28] you don't have to be prayed for
[1:10:30] you got to believe it oh boy's got it
[1:10:33] he's born already
[1:10:39] bro Sam I'd like to say a couple of
[1:10:43] things here uh you all know that I have
[1:10:45] a lot of trouble with diabetes
[1:10:48] there ain't nothing but a devil
[1:10:50] now God's letting this bride be tested
[1:10:54] above measure sure because we got to be
[1:10:58] tested
[1:11:00] to prove to Satan that we're going to
[1:11:02] stand in Hebrew 13 8.
[1:11:05] now I don't know how to say this I'm
[1:11:07] just going to say it
[1:11:09] uh last night
[1:11:11] or yesterday started yesterday evening
[1:11:13] my sugar shot up to 300 plus well didn't
[1:11:18] do nothing to to get it but I got so
[1:11:21] beyond myself I was so bad
[1:11:26] until I I didn't hardly know if I was
[1:11:28] coming to going
[1:11:30] and what I'm saying is Hebrews 13 8 is
[1:11:34] the only thing the same God that started
[1:11:37] this thing is the same God that starts
[1:11:39] in exactly and that's Malachi 4. right
[1:11:42] I was so I was so
[1:11:45] I didn't even a Peggy couldn't even talk
[1:11:48] to me
[1:11:49] and I was where I checked my sugar at
[1:11:52] that my counter anybody been in my house
[1:11:54] they know who I do it
[1:11:55] and I was right there and and I walked
[1:11:58] around
[1:11:59] toward the front of the house and come
[1:12:01] back and come back to my study right
[1:12:04] there and and I I was I was tried
[1:12:08] on Hebrews 13 8. that's what I'm trying
[1:12:11] to say I don't I don't know I know I
[1:12:13] can't get this out but you have to stand
[1:12:15] and know that he's God when you don't
[1:12:18] see nothing you know he said it be
[1:12:20] certain of God he says when you've done
[1:12:23] everything
[1:12:25] everything and there's nothing between
[1:12:27] you and God he said then you've got to
[1:12:30] know that he's God right and that's
[1:12:31] Hebrews 13 8 exactly you got to stand
[1:12:33] there but I'd like to cherish to to
[1:12:36] remember me uh when I said a while ago
[1:12:39] that I'm already healed
[1:12:40] all the devils in hell has fought me
[1:12:43] about this for 45 years going into the
[1:12:45] four to six years but he still lost
[1:12:48] because I've got that God Amen I can
[1:12:52] take that God or God can take me back to
[1:12:56] where he put my name on the land of the
[1:12:57] book of life before the foundation of
[1:12:59] the world and that name is his attribute
[1:13:02] and and he showed me that he showed he's
[1:13:05] took me back and showed me where he put
[1:13:08] my name there he said and he also told
[1:13:11] me that that he knew the deceitfulness
[1:13:15] of Satan and what he was going to do
[1:13:17] when I got here
[1:13:18] so he went ahead and put my name on the
[1:13:20] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:13:22] foundation of the world and that holds
[1:13:24] me and that's Hebrews 13 8 right that's
[1:13:27] the word of God it's a word you we can
[1:13:29] say Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:13:32] forever in the day and forever but what
[1:13:34] we're saying is the word never changes
[1:13:37] right the word is God he is God he
[1:13:40] always will be God and he'll do exactly
[1:13:42] but see you can say with his stripes
[1:13:45] you're healed for 45 years
[1:13:48] and it'd be true he says no matter how
[1:13:51] much Faith you got it won't alter the
[1:13:53] predestinated will of God he's got a
[1:13:55] journey from you that's what he told me
[1:13:57] and showed me when he carried me back
[1:13:59] but back before the beginning now people
[1:14:01] I don't know how other people does I
[1:14:04] don't know that I just know my
[1:14:05] experience I know what God's done in my
[1:14:07] life and I believe the word I believe
[1:14:09] that Jesus is the same and I believe
[1:14:12] that there ain't no devil in the hell
[1:14:13] could keep his diabetes on me I don't
[1:14:16] know when God's got his own time
[1:14:18] and and and I but I believe him amen and
[1:14:22] I've been healed I've been healed praise
[1:14:24] God I am healed amen there ain't no
[1:14:26] devil in hell can preach me out of it
[1:14:28] take me out here they told me out of it
[1:14:30] it's mine God himself that in the
[1:14:34] beginning
[1:14:35] give it to me he saw me healed he'll see
[1:14:38] me he'll crippled up you don't see them
[1:14:41] bypass surgeries and aneurysms he don't
[1:14:43] see that he brought he what he's seen
[1:14:45] was he'd bring me through them all right
[1:14:47] so I'm Healed I mean I'm Healed ain't
[1:14:50] nobody take it away from you
[1:14:54] but I'll tell you you talk about
[1:14:59] I could be here a rest of the night
[1:15:02] who's next
[1:15:06] yeah
[1:15:07] who's next
[1:15:09] there's somebody that's like
[1:15:11] brother Boyd
[1:15:14] I believe
[1:15:16] then you have your hand up oh okay
[1:15:18] oh oh okay yeah
[1:15:21] Brother Gary
[1:15:23] this is a couple of weeks ago and this
[1:15:26] has happened me uh
[1:15:28] many times but
[1:15:31] I was uh
[1:15:34] I would get in these situations where I
[1:15:36] would be struggling and fighting for
[1:15:38] every breath I took and it was uh
[1:15:43] just a
[1:15:45] a
[1:15:45] terror it really terrorizes you when
[1:15:49] you're suffocating you're actually
[1:15:51] suffocating
[1:15:52] and brother they'll call me that day and
[1:15:55] and I I thought I was dying I really did
[1:15:57] because the presence of death was there
[1:16:00] and I don't know if you sensed it when
[1:16:02] you came over
[1:16:03] but it was brother Dale said I'm coming
[1:16:06] over there
[1:16:07] and he came over I was in the bed and he
[1:16:10] didn't pray well I think he did at the
[1:16:13] end you know but we sat there for about
[1:16:15] 20 minutes and we talked about the word
[1:16:19] and he just said a very quick short
[1:16:22] prayer at the end of that when he left I
[1:16:25] got up I vacuumed the house
[1:16:28] I went on my exercise walk I was totally
[1:16:32] and completely delivered to that thing
[1:16:35] but I tell you if you if you've never
[1:16:39] experienced the presence of death
[1:16:41] it's it's real and and it's I guess it's
[1:16:45] another realm that you can pick it up
[1:16:46] but I just thank God
[1:16:48] amen who's next
[1:16:54] brother Cauley
[1:17:02] I just want to say
[1:17:04] lots of times when I'm sleeping I have
[1:17:08] I was having what I thought was seeing
[1:17:11] sometimes everything I think is a heart
[1:17:13] attack yeah but uh it was
[1:17:17] turned out to be acid free floods and it
[1:17:21] was get so bad at times that if I could
[1:17:24] I choked myself
[1:17:25] to get it to go away but I kept praying
[1:17:30] and talking to the Lord and having
[1:17:33] people here at the church to pray for me
[1:17:35] too and finally it just went away but
[1:17:39] then nice I I know I told a few people
[1:17:43] that I've fallen out of bed
[1:17:45] a lot of times
[1:17:47] but
[1:17:49] you know
[1:17:50] it's just like Satan the next time
[1:17:54] you know next time I get you but
[1:17:59] the last time I fell out of bed I
[1:18:02] thought somebody
[1:18:03] threw me out of bed
[1:18:05] and come close to
[1:18:07] hitting me in the eye from from the side
[1:18:10] my ear around to my face which which is
[1:18:13] swell up really bad for a while but
[1:18:17] I know that Christ is real I know that
[1:18:21] the healing has already been taken care
[1:18:24] of so
[1:18:26] I'm not I'm not worried anymore about it
[1:18:28] whatever happens happens only thing I
[1:18:31] tried to is
[1:18:33] make sure that I believe Christ and keep
[1:18:35] him amen first and whatever happens just
[1:18:39] happens right
[1:18:40] thank you Lord for for looking out for
[1:18:43] him and taking care of them amen that's
[1:18:45] it he'll do that
[1:18:47] he'll take care of him he'll be enacted
[1:18:49] anybody
[1:18:59] I guess it was about uh two weeks ago I
[1:19:03] had to go to the kidney doctor and I
[1:19:06] went up for prayer
[1:19:08] but before I went out during the service
[1:19:11] side
[1:19:12] I kept having real bad heart pains so I
[1:19:16] took a Nitro
[1:19:17] and the doctor said it could take two
[1:19:19] you take that third one you go straight
[1:19:22] to the hospital
[1:19:23] well I took that one and it just kept on
[1:19:26] and I said I'm going up for prayer for
[1:19:29] for when I go to the kidney doctor and I
[1:19:32] said when I do
[1:19:33] it's hard problem is going to leave me
[1:19:36] and it did and I thank the Lord for that
[1:19:38] right praise the Lord amen he'll do it
[1:19:42] he'll take care of it
[1:19:44] anybody else
[1:19:48] yeah I know a lot of you told me said
[1:19:49] brother Dale
[1:19:51] I was healed
[1:19:54] well I believe it
[1:19:56] he's he's the same he
[1:19:59] he just he's wanting us to
[1:20:02] believe
[1:20:05] because when it comes down to a poetry
[1:20:09] when you're laying like I was the other
[1:20:10] night when you can't breathe
[1:20:15] you know why me wait wait up
[1:20:23] I knew what it was
[1:20:25] he could pray with me yeah
[1:20:29] but I knew
[1:20:31] try this when I turned son in I said
[1:20:33] I'll just say daylight came he come out
[1:20:37] at 5 30 started cooking breakfast he
[1:20:39] didn't even know I'd been out there all
[1:20:40] night
[1:20:41] let me tell that
[1:20:44] but the next night
[1:20:46] it was different
[1:20:48] it was one of those nights that when
[1:20:52] you know there's something wrong
[1:20:53] somewhere
[1:20:55] but I'm not a prophet
[1:20:58] so I can't tell you where it's at
[1:21:03] yeah I just believe it
[1:21:06] now just call your name and say well
[1:21:08] Lord
[1:21:10] it's somewhere or something's wrong
[1:21:13] then somebody come along later and say
[1:21:14] will this happen or that happened
[1:21:15] brother Gary was talking he said
[1:21:18] did I had a problem the other night I
[1:21:19] said was it about three in the morning
[1:21:22] he said yeah I said that
[1:21:25] enough for me
[1:21:28] because I believe he's the same
[1:21:31] yesterday today and forever
[1:21:37] all he wants us to do is believe it
[1:21:41] you know
[1:21:43] just believe him
[1:21:45] and accept it
[1:21:47] he'll take care of it
[1:21:49] anybody else before
[1:21:53] right
[1:21:55] you know one more but go ahead with
[1:21:57] yours
[1:22:06] well um I was diagnosed with that big
[1:22:09] fibroid when I was pregnant with Sarah
[1:22:12] and my doctor said we'll schedule an
[1:22:15] operation six months after delivery and
[1:22:18] I went in for my six months and thank
[1:22:20] God we didn't have to do it it shrunk
[1:22:22] and
[1:22:23] I thank God for healing me and even if
[1:22:26] it comes back again it's same devil it
[1:22:28] doesn't make a difference God still
[1:22:29] healed me because it doesn't change his
[1:22:32] word so I'm hanging on that
[1:22:35] Sarah wants to talk too
[1:22:37] yeah
[1:22:40] go ahead brother yeah I just remember
[1:22:43] through a call in 2007 I had
[1:22:46] osteomyelitis
[1:22:47] and I was leading song service one day
[1:22:50] up here on Sunday Afternoon brother Nick
[1:22:52] was out of town
[1:22:54] in the afternoon service and
[1:22:56] the pain struck me so bad I didn't know
[1:22:58] what was going on I just began to sweat
[1:23:00] really bad
[1:23:01] but I've had like four kidney stones and
[1:23:04] this is probably 10 times worse than any
[1:23:05] kidney stone I'd ever had
[1:23:07] and got through that day and then we
[1:23:10] went to the hospital and then you came
[1:23:12] with me we spent a couple of hours there
[1:23:15] and the whole time they were saying we
[1:23:17] don't know if it's cancer
[1:23:18] we don't know what it is and it it took
[1:23:22] about three days I think to figure it
[1:23:24] out and they actually had to get the CDC
[1:23:25] involved
[1:23:27] to really figure out narrow down what it
[1:23:30] was but
[1:23:31] but what it was was that osteomyelitis
[1:23:33] was that bone dying
[1:23:35] literally dying and that pain was so
[1:23:38] great that I would just literally cry
[1:23:40] out I'd work all day and cry out to God
[1:23:42] to take me that's how bad the pain was I
[1:23:45] would land the floor and just
[1:23:46] my whole family be around me I'd work
[1:23:48] all day and just cry myself to sleep
[1:23:51] crying out for God to take me and he put
[1:23:53] me in a port in my chest with both drawn
[1:23:56] blood
[1:23:57] once a week and gave me 2 500
[1:23:59] milliliters of Vancomycin which is a
[1:24:02] drip about the biggest bag you can get I
[1:24:04] took every day for church for work I had
[1:24:07] to go to the hospital but allowed me to
[1:24:09] go sit among cancer patients in there
[1:24:11] and the O'Connor ecology lab I guess
[1:24:13] it's called and brother dick and I think
[1:24:16] brother Gary and some of them come up
[1:24:17] here and we were just
[1:24:20] brother dick bring his guitar and we'd
[1:24:22] sing and
[1:24:23] so it put me in a place other when it
[1:24:25] showed me that just people worse off
[1:24:26] than I was
[1:24:28] but what I'm saying as part of a
[1:24:30] testimony in all that I saw where my
[1:24:33] blood was drawn it was pure almost wide
[1:24:35] in the bowel because of the
[1:24:37] triglycerides and come and get prayed
[1:24:39] for and go back on the next blood draw a
[1:24:41] week later it's completely gone and I
[1:24:45] have to this day I've not had any
[1:24:47] instance where I have a backache back
[1:24:49] pain I could still carry feed sacks on
[1:24:52] each solder I have no problem with my
[1:24:54] back
[1:24:56] because God touched me and all that but
[1:24:59] he also
[1:25:01] showed me one thing and that is
[1:25:03] you got to keep your faith and you got
[1:25:05] to keep your focus on the fact that
[1:25:07] you're healed and you got to claim it
[1:25:09] right because if there's this lady at
[1:25:12] work right now
[1:25:13] told me just this week she said I went
[1:25:15] had a CAT scan and they she said
[1:25:18] something that might have thought I had
[1:25:20] a mini stroke and I said what's your
[1:25:21] confession
[1:25:23] and she says I don't think anything
[1:25:25] something happened but I don't believe
[1:25:27] it's that
[1:25:28] and she said on the next day after CAT
[1:25:31] scan she said
[1:25:33] I haven't heard anything and I said well
[1:25:35] you know no news is good news I said
[1:25:37] what are you claiming she says I don't
[1:25:39] know something happened I said
[1:25:41] I'm claiming that there's nothing there
[1:25:43] right and I asked her today I said
[1:25:45] what'd they find out she said well there
[1:25:47] was nothing there and I said that's what
[1:25:48] you've got to believe you know yeah but
[1:25:50] it's just amazing
[1:25:53] I'm telling you you can doubt you can
[1:25:55] talk yourself right into the grave
[1:25:56] exactly and that's where that's what's
[1:25:58] wrong with so many people and when they
[1:26:00] say I hope it really hurts me when
[1:26:03] somebody says I hope right
[1:26:05] you know because I stand there and
[1:26:07] correct him I said but I believe
[1:26:09] you know or you you should believe
[1:26:11] because brother Aaron did a wonderful
[1:26:14] message one time on Hope
[1:26:17] the hopes now it's not what's going to
[1:26:19] get you it's I believe in believing amen
[1:26:22] but I just thank you that he touched me
[1:26:23] but the prayers of the Saints when we
[1:26:25] all come together praying that's the key
[1:26:28] thing I don't think that we come
[1:26:30] together to each other enough to know
[1:26:32] that pray for this brother right now
[1:26:33] right we need to do more of that right
[1:26:36] because there's definitely here so you
[1:26:39] just call out people's name and I just
[1:26:40] appreciate that
[1:26:42] positive attitude
[1:26:45] that's what do we need
[1:26:47] for the board
[1:26:50] Rachel
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:56] how to say it and um
[1:26:58] I'm really um when I was uh sick three
[1:27:01] weeks ago and um
[1:27:03] I'm not normally one to get sick and so
[1:27:07] um I think what it was was well the
[1:27:10] doctor was saying it was was mastitis is
[1:27:12] with just an infection when ladies get
[1:27:14] when they're nursing their babies and
[1:27:16] stuff and so um well they said it was
[1:27:20] that but I don't know because it was the
[1:27:22] sickest I've ever ever ever felt in my
[1:27:24] life it was um
[1:27:26] just somebody touching my skin it was
[1:27:28] just it I was like I couldn't even stand
[1:27:31] and be touched and I was just I was
[1:27:34] running a fever and everything but it
[1:27:35] was the worst I've ever felt and so on
[1:27:38] that Sunday I stayed home from church
[1:27:39] and Joseph
[1:27:41] um Joseph brought I think Jonas and or
[1:27:44] Josiah to church with him and he told
[1:27:47] everybody here you know what was wrong
[1:27:48] with me why I wasn't hearing everything
[1:27:50] and um
[1:27:52] I'm going to be honest and just tell you
[1:27:54] that I didn't have the sense to really
[1:27:56] think about
[1:27:58] asking for prayer and I didn't ask
[1:28:00] Joseph and I didn't ask anybody and
[1:28:03] um and so I got better after that and
[1:28:06] about two days later I don't know if I
[1:28:08] don't think I'm saying this right but
[1:28:10] just the other day I was thinking about
[1:28:12] it and thinking about how awful I felt
[1:28:15] and how sick I was and stuff and the
[1:28:18] thought came to me and I believe it was
[1:28:20] God and he said see there
[1:28:22] I was mindful of you even when you
[1:28:24] didn't have the sense to ask prepare
[1:28:26] yourself yes and I believe that it was
[1:28:28] Joseph coming here and telling the
[1:28:30] Saints to pray for me and telling him
[1:28:33] what was wrong with me and you guys knew
[1:28:34] automatically to pray for me and I I
[1:28:36] know Joseph was probably praying for me
[1:28:38] but I never actually sat there and asked
[1:28:41] him to pray for me and so you know
[1:28:43] that's the way God healed me and that
[1:28:44] was the worst I think that's the worst
[1:28:46] I've ever felt in my life and so that
[1:28:50] that's my
[1:28:52] I don't think that came out right but it
[1:28:55] made sense in my head and Jonas wants a
[1:28:58] microphone where he can say hallelujah
[1:29:02] little filler sits back there and said
[1:29:04] Hallelujah
[1:29:06] right
[1:29:08] who'll be next
[1:29:13] suspicious I'd like to say one of the
[1:29:15] things especially for the people that's
[1:29:17] got ongoing
[1:29:19] afflictions things that's been with them
[1:29:22] for years like Brother Gary they they
[1:29:24] born with them
[1:29:26] but God is still God sure
[1:29:28] and if you can believe you know Joe they
[1:29:31] say he went for a year
[1:29:33] in all this Affliction he has and he
[1:29:36] didn't doubt God he was so bad he wanted
[1:29:38] to be hit in the ground to the Past but
[1:29:42] I can only speak for my and I'm glad I
[1:29:45] could slow down a little bit I was ready
[1:29:47] to start flying a while ago but uh
[1:29:51] God heals me every second of my life
[1:29:53] because because this thing that he has
[1:29:57] allowed to come on me has brought me to
[1:30:00] to the faith
[1:30:02] that that I have he's brought me to I
[1:30:06] that I believe him in spite of every
[1:30:08] devil
[1:30:09] there he is
[1:30:11] but every every minute every second
[1:30:15] that I live God gives it to me sure I
[1:30:18] don't mean it I feel great and all
[1:30:20] because older I get seems like the worse
[1:30:22] it gets you know but I I still maintain
[1:30:27] that God is the God of all creation
[1:30:29] right
[1:30:30] and he healed me when he put my name on
[1:30:32] the land Book of Life he sees me heal
[1:30:35] and I'm coming to it he said it is here
[1:30:38] it's here with me now because he's
[1:30:40] inside my soul but I I like to say this
[1:30:43] just one one time
[1:30:45] the people that has these things and we
[1:30:49] all you know like sister Rachel God did
[1:30:51] that for her for a purpose so that next
[1:30:54] time and Satan is going to come yes one
[1:30:57] thing you can you can kill and he's
[1:30:59] coming now worse than he's ever come and
[1:31:03] he's more deceptive now than he's ever
[1:31:05] been he's more evil than that if you
[1:31:07] could say that than he's ever been and
[1:31:09] he is trying to get us off of what you
[1:31:12] preach tonight you've got to know that
[1:31:15] he's God right and and if you don't know
[1:31:17] him by the word then I don't see how you
[1:31:20] could know him no you have to study
[1:31:22] yourself
[1:31:25] God you've got to you've got to he did
[1:31:28] something for me last Thursday night bro
[1:31:31] Sam I was in one of those States I mean
[1:31:33] I I don't mean that I was aggravated now
[1:31:36] I was I mean that he was trying to kill
[1:31:38] me
[1:31:39] and I and I went through there and and
[1:31:42] every time I checked my sugar he was
[1:31:43] higher higher and I wasn't doing
[1:31:45] anything higher and higher and higher he
[1:31:48] just goes Plum out of sight and I walked
[1:31:51] I took the familiar trip back toward the
[1:31:54] door to my garage door and done a a 180
[1:31:58] and went back into my study and God is
[1:32:00] my witness i s I come and sat down in my
[1:32:03] chair and I sat there and I reached and
[1:32:06] I got my books to lay in there and I
[1:32:08] picked up the greatest battle ever
[1:32:09] fought and I just read just a little bit
[1:32:12] I preached on it many years and I
[1:32:15] believe it I know that it's the truth
[1:32:17] but I didn't feel satisfied I just laid
[1:32:20] it down and I picked up Abraham's Royal
[1:32:22] seed I did the same thing in in this one
[1:32:25] here but it didn't feel satisfied I I
[1:32:28] just laid it down I knew it was the
[1:32:30] truth and I picked up the reality of
[1:32:32] living realities of God the reality is
[1:32:35] of God and then when I sat down I sat
[1:32:37] there I was just sitting looking figures
[1:32:39] in the other room
[1:32:40] and a word come in my mind just it was
[1:32:44] just there and I took a recent got my
[1:32:47] Bible off my end table and reached over
[1:32:49] and and I knew the word I knew that Paul
[1:32:52] had said it but I wanted to see I
[1:32:54] couldn't remember right off because I
[1:32:56] was going through so much that I that I
[1:32:58] that I was trying to remember where I
[1:33:00] was at and I just went to the reference
[1:33:02] and I found two two scriptures
[1:33:05] and then I won't go into all that but
[1:33:07] when I read those scriptures God began
[1:33:10] to speak to him and showed me what he
[1:33:13] has had me doing to this present moment
[1:33:16] he he the the ministry that he has
[1:33:19] called me to he's he he showed me he I
[1:33:22] mean he showed me I mean I I don't know
[1:33:24] what anybody believes you believe me or
[1:33:26] not that's immaterial to me I can't help
[1:33:28] it I just have to say what you say I say
[1:33:31] what I believe and I believe God's doing
[1:33:33] he showed me that he showed me in these
[1:33:36] two scriptures he showed in all at once
[1:33:39] whatever that was that was that was
[1:33:42] pressing me down like you that had me I
[1:33:44] mean I I thought I would die I thought I
[1:33:47] was going to die and he just took it
[1:33:50] away but I but I just wanted the people
[1:33:53] to know that every second you live
[1:33:56] you're in Pearl if it wasn't for God
[1:33:59] Satan would kill you and you better
[1:34:02] praise God that you ain't got some of
[1:34:04] these afflictions and some of these
[1:34:06] people that are we are we see somebody
[1:34:07] like that right there like brother Dale
