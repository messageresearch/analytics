[31:31] amen thank you Lord
[31:34] Jesus so we're going to take off from
[31:36] where we left off amen Financial Jubilee
[31:40] 11 fighting words fighting words my my
[31:45] my I hope by the time we get through
[31:46] this you have that understanding of what
[31:48] fighting words mean you know when I was
[31:51] young and coming up we grew up what we
[31:53] call the hood it was the hood we a call
[31:56] it it was the hood
[31:57] believe me that's where we grew up and
[32:00] it was something about fighting words
[32:01] you know the one thing they had to say
[32:02] if they said something about your mother
[32:04] your mama that was fighting words period
[32:08] And I wasn't much of a fighter I got to
[32:10] be honest with you my brother he had all
[32:12] those types of jeans so I didn't have to
[32:14] worry too much because he was older and
[32:16] he always had my back but I remember
[32:18] once getting into a little scuffle with
[32:19] a guy and um you know he said something
[32:22] about my mama you know and the other kid
[32:25] would had to remind me you know he said
[32:26] something about your mama you need to
[32:29] act and I did act amen I think that was
[32:32] the last time you ever said anything
[32:33] about my mama that's right so that's
[32:36] what I want you to get when you hear
[32:38] fighting words something should trigger
[32:40] you and sometimes we do have to be
[32:42] reminded we got to be reminded oh we
[32:44] should be armed we're in a fight we're
[32:47] in a
[32:48] battle okay and what I'm hearing on the
[32:51] pulpit is fighting words to trigger
[32:53] something in me to fight we have to
[32:57] that's what this word is it's a what
[32:59] it's a sword he didn't give us a pillow
[33:02] he gave us a sword to fight with to
[33:07] fight for everything see I don't want
[33:09] the devil to have nothing that belongs
[33:11] to me not one penny why would I give him
[33:14] a penny I don't want him to have my
[33:15] penny I'll do something with that Penny
[33:17] but he's not going to have it I don't
[33:19] want him to have my kids I don't want to
[33:20] have my family I don't want to have
[33:22] anything that God wants me to have and
[33:25] I'm going to take this word this sword
[33:28] and I'm going to fight with it so when
[33:30] we look in the word we got to know what
[33:31] it's talking about is fighting words not
[33:34] sleeping words it's fighting words by
[33:37] the grace of God so as we get into this
[33:40] this is what I hope you hear fighting
[33:41] words amen and like I said the word is a
[33:44] sword and we have to
[33:46] hear we hear the word we hear the

[34:51] fighting
[34:52] words I love the story brother Ram told
[34:56] you know of the the the elderly lady and
[34:58] um you know she was living in poverty
[35:02] you know she was dying she was starving
[35:06] to death that's what our Prophet said
[35:07] starving to death poverty stricken so
[35:11] someone turned her into the charity and
[35:12] they went in and they started talking to
[35:14] her and said hey don't you have any
[35:17] family she said yeah I do I have a
[35:18] hardworking son he's in India on
[35:21] business like wow that sounds promising
[35:23] well I mean does he know about your
[35:25] situation well I can't tell him about my
[35:28] situation my you know I don't want to
[35:30] wor he's such a good boy I don't want to
[35:32] bother him he said well you should tell
[35:34] him cuz you you about to die you need to
[35:36] do something she said well I just can't
[35:38] do it but I tell you what he is a good
[35:40] son he sends me the prettiest
[35:42] pictures she said really my said well
[35:46] something is wrong with this boy I mean
[35:48] my goodness he sent his mom pictures and
[35:49] she's starving let me see those pictures
[35:52] she went and got her Bible open up those
[35:54] pictures and what they were they were
[35:56] draft notes from the bank she was
[35:59] actually very very wealthy rich and
[36:03] didn't know it didn't know it my and our
[36:07] Prophet said you don't have to act like
[36:09] the world you don't have to go all bound
[36:10] up you're rich where do you find it at
[36:14] in the Bible you just looked it over and
[36:16] thought it was just a picture book or
[36:18] some other true story but it isn't it's
[36:21] God's word you are rich you are rich
[36:26] brothers and sisters that's to all of us
[36:29] each one we are rich but I can assure
[36:32] you it's going to take a moment for you
[36:34] to recognize that to really live into
[36:37] that to come into that presence where
[36:38] you can act into
[36:40] that there's a song that says our father
[36:43] is rich in houses and land he holds the
[36:45] wealth of the world in his hands of
[36:47] rubies and diamonds and silver and gold
[36:50] his coffers are full he has riches
[36:52] Untold I'm a child of the king I promise
[36:56] you if we could really see and recognize
[36:58] and act on that the way we should we
[37:00] could end this Jubilee right now and go
[37:02] home I can assure you because it's God's
[37:05] word this is our father this is our
[37:09] father but I know because I live through
[37:11] the same thing you do where it's a fight
[37:14] but if I can hear God's fighting words
[37:16] and get into that and be able to
[37:19] recognize and I will see so hear
[37:22] recognize and act on the word of God
[37:26] amen praise the Lord Jesus amen let's go
[37:30] ahead and stand we'll read the
[37:31] scripture in Nehemiah
[37:43] 4
[37:45] 14 it says and I looked and Rose up and
[37:50] said unto the Nobles and to the rulers
[37:53] and to the rest of the people be not not
[37:56] ye afraid of them remember the Lord
[38:00] which is great and terrible and fight
[38:03] for your brethren your sons and your
[38:07] daughters your wives and your
[38:12] houses amen you may be seated my my my
[38:17] what a powerful scripture we have looked
[38:21] and Rose up and said be not afraid of
[38:24] them remember the Lord which is great
[38:26] and terrible and fight for your brethren
[38:29] your sons and your daughters your wives
[38:31] and your houses amen so when you hear
[38:35] fighting words the first thing you could
[38:36] should think about is that there is an
[38:39] enemy there is an enemy and in Nehemiah
[38:42] if you go back and read some of that
[38:44] chapter you will find out what happened
[38:46] as we know he went there trying to build
[38:48] a wall and it had Jewish people raising
[38:52] up Judah who was there they said we
[38:54] don't have the strength it's too much
[38:57] rubbish it's too
[38:58] much adversaries said hey we going to go
[39:01] kill him that's right the Jews that were
[39:02] living close to the adversary said hey
[39:05] 10 times they came up and said the enemy
[39:08] is going to be upon you putting in that
[39:10] fear but here Nehemiah rose up looked at
[39:13] the whole thing and said hey don't be
[39:15] afraid remember the Lord amen and as we
[39:18] get into any of God's promises and are
[39:21] certainly around money remember the Lord
[39:23] that's why it said we're a child of the
[39:25] king we are we are that my brothers and
[39:28] sisters we are children of the king but
[39:31] you got all kind of things and you got
[39:33] an enemy that would want to keep that
[39:35] from us amen that's his job to keep
[39:38] these things from us to keep us from all
[39:41] of the things God has for
[39:44] us and so a army first in getting ready
[39:48] for battle first there's got to be a
[39:51] select some soldiers they've got to be
[39:53] dressed for fighting they've got to be
[39:55] trained for
[39:57] fighting so when you're dealing with
[39:59] anything with God we have to be trained
[40:03] we got to be trained yes we do and I
[40:05] thank God for this church because we
[40:06] know it's a teaching church but again
[40:09] remember what it's trying to teach you
[40:10] fighting words not sleeping words it's
[40:13] trying to teach you fighting words so we
[40:15] can recognize and we can act on it
[40:17] that's what it's trying to do and the
[40:19] same thing I'm doing this morning
[40:20] presenting this to you so you can fight
[40:23] so you can be trained in this area we
[40:26] got to get our muscles up that's the
[40:28] problem we don't have our muscles to the
[40:30] point that we can
[40:31] fight this is a real battle my brothers
[40:34] and sisters this is a real
[40:36] battle soldiers
[40:39] die bankrupt happens divorce happens not
[40:43] outside of this message in this message
[40:45] I'm talking
[40:46] about okay so it's that kind of battle
[40:49] it's a real battle amen as I said every
[40:51] day I'm fighting I'm fighting for my
[40:53] family I'm fighting for my kids I'm
[40:55] fighting my own enemy that's in this
[40:58] flesh I'm fighting every single day so
[41:01] we have to be trained see with the
[41:03] things of money I wish I could go right
[41:05] in and start showing you do this do that
[41:07] do this that's I'm sure that's what
[41:08] everybody wants what what what secret
[41:10] can I do what is the
[41:13] secret you have to be trained to handle
[41:15] that secret right see our father knows
[41:18] that okay if I had a billion dollars I
[41:22] have to be equipped to handle that level
[41:24] of responsibility I wouldn't want a
[41:27] billion dollars and be on my fifth
[41:30] marriage okay I don't know I don't want
[41:33] that but if God had that for me I want
[41:36] to be able to manage that with my wife
[41:40] and my children amen and my grandkids in
[41:43] the generations to come amen so that
[41:45] they see God like our Father Abraham am
[41:49] who is Rich and servants and all that
[41:50] but he knew that money couldn't answer
[41:54] all of life situations it was properly
[41:57] placed properly placed and that's what
[42:00] God wants us to be able to handle
[42:01] whatever he has for us but to have it
[42:03] properly placed but we got to be
[42:06] trained see money Dave Ramsey said look
[42:08] he said it's 80% behavior and I believe
[42:11] that it's 20% knowledge so I can start
[42:13] telling you do this do that and you'll
[42:14] be excited you'll be excited today
[42:16] you're here you here you may recognize a
[42:19] little bit then you'll get home and
[42:20] something else will happen be like
[42:22] well you know what yeah let's go out to
[42:24] eat I'm tired
[42:27] you know don't know what where you got
[42:29] the money don't know where it's coming
[42:30] from but hey look that that was good he
[42:32] said something you know he said
[42:35] something yeah you know what one day one
[42:39] day one day and generations are going
[42:42] past one day one day we had this same
[42:45] Bible that has all of these precious
[42:47] promises it's not a pretty picture book
[42:50] it's a ticket to a billion dollars right
[42:52] here right
[42:54] here this is word of God is every single
[42:58] thing you have need of on this journey
[43:01] my goodness if you are a young person
[43:03] and can see what I'm trying to tell you
[43:05] you want to be able to handle a billion
[43:07] dollars get in this word of God it's
[43:10] that it's your skills it's your job it's
[43:13] your career it's the door that God wants
[43:15] to open for you it's every Avenue
[43:18] everything amen yes we hear of the deep
[43:21] things but all of the small things are
[43:23] included in there if you got $100 you
[43:26] got $1 it's the same it's you've got a
[43:28] bill you got everything so every single
[43:30] thing is in this word of God but we have
[43:32] to be trained to handle all of
[43:34] this we can't handle all of these
[43:37] precious promises without being trained
[43:41] my I think of David and we know he went
[43:44] out and he killed that lion he killed
[43:46] that bear you know and and that was
[43:49] normal for David now you might have
[43:51] thought you know and I always thought
[43:52] about this that David now we know David
[43:54] was human it was a question as brother W
[43:57] was saying this morning he was a murder
[43:58] adultery M he was human so tell me what
[44:01] was going on as a teenager that he could
[44:03] walk out there and not be scared of
[44:05] Goliath either he was crazy right or
[44:08] something was wrong yeah right but I
[44:10] want to tell you that he had to be
[44:12] trained so I'm thinking Lord how would
[44:15] this young man do this this is not
[44:17] normal if he would commit adultery and
[44:19] David was obviously normal so what's
[44:22] going on that he would do that I said
[44:24] well you know he said he killed a bear
[44:26] yes he killed a lion but that ain't a
[44:28] little I said my goodness David must
[44:30] have been going through something in
[44:31] that desert area that made him say I
[44:35] can't go back home with this sheep
[44:37] missing no right Lord I've been putting
[44:40] a rock in a hard place man my brothers
[44:43] they going to go crazy D oh my Lord I'm
[44:47] either going to die or that lion is
[44:50] going down right God be with me I'm
[44:53] going to take you Lord at your word help
[44:55] me Lord I I don't I know what to do but
[44:56] I can't go back home had to be that much
[44:58] distress in his normal day-to-day life
[45:01] that he would say you know what I'm
[45:02] facing it and he went out there and did
[45:04] it and when he came back he was like
[45:06] Lord my God I killed a lion he must have
[45:09] walked back he could tell his brother
[45:10] they wouldn't have believed him he just
[45:12] walked around had it in himself like
[45:14] Lord that lion is
[45:16] gone Lord you are real my goodness and
[45:21] he Joy he started writing music he like
[45:23] Lord I'll take it all for myself Lord
[45:25] you've done this for me praise the Lord
[45:29] my so by the time the bear came along
[45:32] he's like
[45:33] Lord again another test another trial oh
[45:37] Lord
[45:38] God all right Lord you did it once Lord
[45:42] I'm going trust you I'm going to go out
[45:45] did it again my goodness he had lost his
[45:48] mind by that point he was like Lord
[45:51] father you answer my prayers I don't
[45:53] have anything to be scared of please if
[45:55] I killed a lion a bear come on come on
[45:58] please then Lord if I stand up for you
[45:59] if I act if I recognize and I act this
[46:02] little bit my muscles have gotten big
[46:04] enough Lord my so by the time he went
[46:07] out to Goliath he was probably living in
[46:09] that environment like Lord you are just
[46:12] everything I don't care if I live or die
[46:14] Lord you are every single thing so
[46:16] there's no way this uncircumcised
[46:19] Philistines is going to stand up here
[46:20] and say that I'm going to walk in it I'm
[46:22] going to act in this and when he did we
[46:25] know the result
[46:26] Goliath was history but he had to be
[46:29] trained he had to be trained and the
[46:31] same for us we have to be trained in
[46:33] these things and money is just a tool
[46:36] for you to practice practice handling
[46:39] these great things that God wants to
[46:42] give you to bless yourself your family
[46:44] his people but we got to be
[46:47] trained like I tell you you know this
[46:50] this um powerful verse quote I just I
[46:53] really love it said now the people today
[46:54] are expecting God to reach down and get
[46:56] them by the neck say yes that's right
[46:58] you bring me out clean me off heal me
[47:01] and I'll believe you God doesn't do his
[47:06] business that way he gives you the
[47:10] promise but you have got to fight for
[47:14] every inch of ground that you possess do
[47:18] you still believe the prophet brother
[47:20] that's what he's saying you got to fight
[47:23] God is going to give you the promise
[47:24] he's goingon to give you the tools
[47:25] whatever you need he's going to give it
[47:27] to you but you're GNA have to fight for
[47:28] it you're gonna have to fight for every
[47:31] scent of money that God wants you to
[47:34] have that he places it within your hands
[47:38] you're going to have to fight for it
[47:39] amen I love what God allowed me and my
[47:42] wife and family to go through when we
[47:44] ran out there like everybody else not
[47:46] knowing this wasn't just a picture
[47:48] book thinking it was just that thinking
[47:51] oh we were saved and thank God but Lord
[47:53] I guess everything else we got to just
[47:54] get the world's way yeah huh my my my so
[47:58] we ran out there grabbed our 40-year
[48:00] loan 40e loan to get the payment down
[48:03] and my I was like oh thank God I'm doing
[48:06] well look at this you know we were just
[48:09] pleased that they would give us that
[48:11] loan my we wanted a bathroom with two
[48:13] sinks in it I remember I was wanted that
[48:15] we went in that house and they were like
[48:17] no we don't want to do that but we were
[48:20] so happy to get that loan that it was
[48:21] like okay we don't want to ask too many
[48:23] questions we don't want to ask too many
[48:25] thank than you sir we are so grateful
[48:27] for this Lo loan that you're giving us
[48:29] that we oh that's why the Bible says
[48:32] what the borrow is servant to the lender
[48:35] we walked in there servants we didn't
[48:37] have any power but just to accept what
[48:39] they wanted to give
[48:41] us but after God started showing me in
[48:44] this word after we lost so much money I
[48:46] told a story in business and things like
[48:48] that I said Lord something's wrong I'm
[48:51] paying my tithes you know I I I I God I
[48:55] went to college I think I thought I knew
[48:57] about managing money but Lord
[48:59] something's off Lord help me show me
[49:02] Teach Me amen train me and he started
[49:05] training me am he started training me
[49:08] and I've been on that Journey ever since
[49:10] my brothers and sisters and I can tell
[49:11] you my life is
[49:13] transformed because of what God trained
[49:15] Me On by his grace 2007 we owed
[49:19] $32,000 on this house if we would have
[49:22] kept everything the way it was the
[49:24] paperwork that they gave us is telling
[49:26] us you going to give us
[49:27] $836,000
[49:30] but I never looked at the paperwork I
[49:32] just signed it I was okay we can make
[49:34] the payment okay it doesn't seem like it
[49:36] matters cuz I get to have the house and
[49:39] we're so
[49:40] excited my goodness but we pulled oursel
[49:44] together after we start looking in this
[49:45] word like Lord this ain't a picture book
[49:47] father God you telling me if I obey God
[49:50] that I should be the head not the tail
[49:52] my you don't like your children

[49:58] us when we obey you and you got debt as
[50:00] a curse my goodness Lord you're saying

[50:09] supposed to be Lord my my my Lord God
[50:13] you have all of these things in your
[50:15] word and we started little by little
[50:18] walking slowly slowly selling things
[50:21] that we didn't need you know paying off
[50:24] debt little by little by a little paid
[50:26] off a lot of that business debt and by
[50:28] that time I'm like
[50:30] Lord huh that business debt is gone I've
[50:34] never had that much money in my life
[50:35] just by
[50:36] itself so I'm like I could pay that debt
[50:39] off paid it off was around
[50:42] $245,000 I've never had that much cash
[50:44] saved ever period but when I saw that I
[50:47] was like man we haven't missed anything

[50:52] felt more bonded more in love you know

[53:34] could speak a world into existence and
[53:36] go live on it Hallelujah there you are
[53:41] amen we need to start losing our minds
[53:44] because this is the truth our minds
[53:47] can't accept this I know it can't cuz
[53:49] you can't accept that you can have a
[53:50] billion dollars that seems no well see
[53:53] then well and then your mind start
[53:54] telling you all this stuff if you could
[53:56] create a world and live into it my God a
[54:00] billion is a small thing start realizing
[54:03] that it's a small thing amen that you
[54:05] could create a world there's gold
[54:07] streets there's gold buildings there's
[54:09] anything think about that now you think
[54:12] God is just we just making this up like
[54:14] we're just saying this no this is where
[54:16] God wants our mind to get away from
[54:18] where we're thinking is just a fairy
[54:20] tale no he's telling you you got that
[54:23] power that's what power is in the church
[54:25] now it's now but it's controlled by a
[54:28] law see now we start saying well see
[54:31] it's a law see that's why all things are
[54:34] possible to them that believe and if you
[54:36] can believe it whatever God will lead
[54:38] your soul to believe that is yours every
[54:43] place The Souls of your foot can set
[54:46] upon by faith God gives it to you amen
[54:49] it's yours you possess it if you can
[54:52] find the key to this law of faith that
[54:54] op it to you that's right if you are a
[54:57] son of God you are a daughter of God
[55:00] that never leaves you it's with you all
[55:02] the time but your faith gets away from
[55:06] it but it's still there right the
[55:10] billion dollars it's still there it's
[55:13] it's still there okay but our faith so
[55:16] this power it's still here but our faith
[55:20] we we can't we can't seem to grasp it we
[55:22] can't seem it gets away from us why
[55:24] because we're not practicing we're not
[55:26] training he told us we have to be
[55:27] trained he told us that already okay and
[55:31] you have to get your muscles up to
[55:33] handle these types of
[55:35] things so we have to be trained in that
[55:37] we have to fight for these precious
[55:39] promises believe by faith and see all
[55:43] faith has to do with that ability to
[55:45] obey God the ability to obey God that's
[55:48] what David had when he went out and saw
[55:49] Goliath he had the ability to obey God
[55:53] cuz he was trained he was equipped
[55:55] equpped okay and we're trained and
[55:57] equipped then we will be able to handle
[55:58] this power that God has promised us in
[56:01] this day and time believe that by the
[56:04] grace of the Lord
[56:07] amen now remember this Christ in the
[56:10] true church is a continuation of the
[56:11] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[56:13] shows that how the Antichrist Spirit
[56:15] would come into the church and defile it
[56:18] making it lukewarm formal powerless it
[56:21] exposes Satan revealing his Works
[56:23] attempted destruction of God's people
[56:25] and the discrediting of God's word he
[56:28] fights that say that word again he
[56:30] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[56:32] people get the true revelation of the
[56:33] true church and what she is what she
[56:36] stands for and that she can do the
[56:39] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[56:43] Army amen praise the Lord look at it
[56:47] real close look at it we talked about
[56:50] that power we talked about a lot of
[56:51] things so far but this is bringing out
[56:54] there's something the reason it's
[56:55] fighting words because there is an enemy
[56:58] there is an enemy he wants to discredit
[57:01] all of this he wants to disarm you in
[57:05] everything disarm you in your marriage
[57:07] disarm you in dealing with your kids
[57:09] disarm you in this life's journey and
[57:13] have you powerless a powerless born
[57:16] again Christian that's what he
[57:19] wants but God doesn't want that for us
[57:23] he want us to be powerful
[57:25] have the ability to create a world and
[57:28] have the character to say I'll wait
[57:32] yeah I can do it but I'll wait until God
[57:36] tells me to do it and if that's life or
[57:39] death I'll still wait right I don't have
[57:42] to show it I don't have to show it off I
[57:44] can hold it until God tells me move make
[57:48] that move character that's what he wants
[57:50] but you have to be trained into this I
[57:52] hope your mind is just going out and
[57:54] thinking about about your money and the
[57:55] little things that we can't even we
[57:58] can't break away
[58:00] from and this kind of
[58:04] power it's real my brothers and sisters
[58:06] Is that real but that's where we have to
[58:08] come to if we want to be that Invincible
[58:12] Army amen right but remember the devil
[58:15] is fighting that and he's a good
[58:18] adversary like the sister said he's a
[58:21] good adversary he's very good very
[58:26] good Invincible means too powerful to be
[58:29] defeated or overcome impossible to
[58:33] defeat or prevent from doing what is
[58:35] intended amen Invincible comes from the
[58:38] Latin word to conquer that's it
[58:42] Invincible that's what God wants us to
[58:44] be in all areas of our life Invincible
[58:50] with your children Invincible with your
[58:53] spouse invincible with your parents
[58:56] Invincible with any of the challenges
[58:59] that we face and knowing you have that
[59:02] kind of power that God wants you to have
[59:05] see we're intended in this day and time
[59:07] to conquer to overcome right you know I
[59:10] can't help but think about this word all
[59:12] the precious promises finances
[59:15] everything that this Bible laid out for
[59:16] all these generations and we're down to
[59:19] this time the prophet has come the
[59:20] prophet has gone you have seen your
[59:23] parents come up and go you've seen
[59:24] Believers we've seen all of this and we
[59:26] know all of these things because this
[59:28] word that's preached here we know it we
[59:31] cannot say we haven't heard it we have
[59:33] heard it I do believe we're challenged
[59:36] in recognizing it sometimes no doubt and
[59:38] certainly challenged in acting on it
[59:40] because it's not easy amen that's why
[59:42] it's fighting words it's to trigger you
[59:45] to start stepping out there to start
[59:47] fighting to start pressing to start
[59:49] moving so we can get to that point where
[59:51] you are invincible if you had a billion
[59:53] dollars I'm sure many of your financial
[59:55] problems that you have you would feel
[59:56] Invincible you really would be like hey
[59:58] that's that's no problem no big deal I
[1:00:02] feel good my investments are going to
[1:00:04] pay for I don't even have to work if I
[1:00:06] don't want to I'm pretty much Invincible
[1:00:08] I don't have to worry about the car
[1:00:09] breaking down I'll just buy another one
[1:00:11] it doesn't matter hey it's all good my
[1:00:15] what Smiles would you have on your faces
[1:00:17] you know what I mean my goodness
[1:00:19] Invincible yeah that's what I want to be
[1:00:22] I want to be Invincible in all areas of
[1:00:24] my life but I know I have to be trained
[1:00:28] I got to be trained to respond to my
[1:00:29] kids in the right way I got to be
[1:00:31] trained to respond to my wife in the
[1:00:33] right way I got to be trained to respond
[1:00:35] to my own brain right between these two
[1:00:38] ears in the right way trained in it so I
[1:00:42] can feel Invincible I can feel that my
[1:00:46] my my praise the Lord see we haven't
[1:00:48] even talked about financial Jubilee yet
[1:00:50] we're just not getting
[1:00:53] started praise the Lord Jesus but I had
[1:00:56] to set that stage because I want you to
[1:00:58] see that all of these things are ours my
[1:01:01] brothers and sisters all of these things
[1:01:03] and I do I want you to fight for
[1:01:05] everything that God has for
[1:01:08] you we must we must do that every single
[1:01:12] scent all these things praise the Lord
[1:01:15] Jesus it's not difficult things that we
[1:01:17] have to do it's all of these things
[1:01:19] small things that we have to just train
[1:01:21] and fight you know you have to train and
[1:01:24] fight you know don't sit there and let
[1:01:26] the devil just go Haywire on you in your
[1:01:29] life stand up so no stand up whatever
[1:01:33] that takes you know go pray do something
[1:01:37] don't just accept your mind don't accept
[1:01:39] what it tells you you know what I mean
[1:01:41] likey I'm done I'm I'm gonna do this I'm
[1:01:43] going to do that this feels good no so
[1:01:46] no no no I know I know better not to do
[1:01:49] this I know better right not to respond
[1:01:52] to my wife this way I know better it's
[1:01:54] not easy it's not easy but as we
[1:01:58] practice on all of these things and you
[1:02:00] just husband keep your mouth you
[1:02:05] know and go pray that thing off and then
[1:02:08] like oh what was I even upset
[1:02:11] about my she is a wonderful wife I just
[1:02:14] love her it's amazing I mean you go
[1:02:16] through things like that that actually
[1:02:19] happens you know but 2 minutes you're
[1:02:21] under so much pressure it's like you
[1:02:23] know our Prophet said said this he said
[1:02:25] he walked in the house I love the way he
[1:02:26] said it because I don't have to say it
[1:02:29] he said feel like your head is about to
[1:02:30] explode that's what he said that's his
[1:02:33] words look it up yeah he said I live
[1:02:35] through it that's what he
[1:02:37] said so if my head feels a little you
[1:02:40] know sometimes the Lord I can say hey
[1:02:42] the prophet felt that way too yes he did
[1:02:44] you know human
[1:02:46] human but we learn to fight we learn to
[1:02:48] get on our knees Lord help us get us
[1:02:50] through this Lord father give me wisdom
[1:02:52] give me Grace father give me your wisdom
[1:02:55] father that's what I need Lord to deal
[1:02:57] with this situation don't want to be too
[1:02:59] hard don't want to be too soft we got to
[1:03:01] fight to be in the middle of this road
[1:03:04] fight in the middle you see and that's
[1:03:06] what it is and when we come when we
[1:03:07] start talking about money it's it's we
[1:03:09] fight because like if I be rich uh but
[1:03:11] what are you doing with the money that
[1:03:13] you have that can tell you something you
[1:03:15] know I have people I don't want to be
[1:03:17] rich but you got all that credit debt
[1:03:19] you know what what what what do you what
[1:03:21] it doesn't make sense well God don't
[1:03:22] want us to be wait a second huh you
[1:03:25] really think so well my Bible is telling
[1:03:28] me some different things it's telling me
[1:03:30] that God has things for me and I want
[1:03:33] everything that God has for me that's it
[1:03:35] amen I don't care what anybody else says
[1:03:37] I want what everything that God has for
[1:03:39] me that's what I want
[1:03:42] period
[1:03:44] amen Financial Jubilee our Prophet comes
[1:03:47] along
[1:03:49] 1965 he says clean your lives up pay
[1:03:53] your debts
[1:03:54] oh no man Jesus said get all things off
[1:03:57] your hands get everything right Make
[1:04:01] Ready Get Ready remember in the name of
[1:04:04] the Lord something is fixing to

[1:04:18] ready amen get ready for all of the
[1:04:21] promises that we've been hearing about
[1:04:23] amen we don't have time to have all of
[1:04:26] these distractions in our life with such
[1:04:29] promises that's waiting for us we don't
[1:04:33] have the time for it period we have to
[1:04:37] learn to fight quickly how to fight how
[1:04:40] to get on our knees get these spirits
[1:04:43] and these things off of us and move on
[1:04:47] by the grace of the Lord see I practice
[1:04:49] all the time especially in this area of
[1:04:52] money okay and you guys see the the
[1:04:55] older vehicle I have you are probably
[1:04:56] the only people that see some of the old
[1:04:58] old vehicle I have because nobody at
[1:04:59] Works they sometimes see it they don't
[1:05:01] see it but sometimes I walk out and I
[1:05:04] know they oh he's I'm a manager at work
[1:05:07] you know and I can imagine people want
[1:05:08] to say I wonder what car he's in and
[1:05:11] sometime I feel that little Spirit
[1:05:12] coming around me a wait don't let them
[1:05:14] see I'm like what am I doing no it
[1:05:16] doesn't matter like these people don't
[1:05:19] know me I'm going in my car you know and
[1:05:23] I'm getting in
[1:05:25] you know why am I hesitating I mean this
[1:05:27] is this is normal but I'm practicing I'm
[1:05:29] like Lord yes because soon as I'm ready
[1:05:31] Lord and I feel like I'm ready then I
[1:05:33] will but I don't need to do it because
[1:05:35] I'm feeling this and I'm trying to
[1:05:37] impress somebody no they don't know me
[1:05:39] from Blue from left period amen and Lord
[1:05:43] I want to enjoy my b i I do if I can't
[1:05:46] clean this thing up the way I want then
[1:05:47] I don't need to get another vehicle I'm
[1:05:49] no I can't even keep this thing clean
[1:05:51] I'm just running around all the time I'm
[1:05:53] like no no slow down what am I in a rush
[1:05:57] for who am I trying to
[1:05:59] impress I go to church with Believers so
[1:06:02] I don't want to try to impress you but
[1:06:04] we got Spirits so we some sometimes want
[1:06:07] to impress each other you know no now
[1:06:10] I'm not saying anything wrong with that
[1:06:12] but let's make sure it's cleaning your
[1:06:14] lives up not complicating your lives not
[1:06:16] making your lives more complicated and
[1:06:18] now I'm going to do this and honey you
[1:06:19] do this and you squeeze from left you
[1:06:21] pull from right and we'll go pray for
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:25] trust that it come through can you coign
[1:06:27] for this can you I've done all of that
[1:06:30] I've done that honey they need your name
[1:06:32] on the paper you put your name when we
[1:06:33] were doing business oh my God and she
[1:06:36] had enough sense to be like John I don't
[1:06:37] know just sign your name I'm like just
[1:06:40] doesn't matter he just said the husband
[1:06:42] and the wife has to sign why are you
[1:06:44] worrying about it you know you know
[1:06:46] that's how you feel like why are you
[1:06:48] don't worry about it honey just it's go
[1:06:50] I have it all under control until it's
[1:06:53] not under control right but that's how
[1:06:55] you feel like it can't go wrong you know
[1:06:58] and we went in I remember signing the
[1:07:00] loan and we had a lawyer we we were
[1:07:02] doing hard money lending and what that
[1:07:04] means you don't necessarily have the
[1:07:05] credit long as you have some backup to
[1:07:07] it you got a house or something like
[1:07:09] that then they were loan you when we
[1:07:10] were doing business property and they
[1:07:12] said yeah but bring your wife in you
[1:07:13] know this I won't call him a slick
[1:07:15] lawyer but he was a lawyer you know and
[1:07:19] he come on in he had sushi like you can
[1:07:21] have some you know we ate sushi and it's
[1:07:23] like yeah sign in we need your wife to
[1:07:25] sign as well now he knew what he was
[1:07:27] doing but we were kids like yes how much
[1:07:30] we have access to a million oh that's so
[1:07:33] wonderful we could buy all kind of
[1:07:34] properties uhhuh until the stock market
[1:07:37] and the the real estate market started
[1:07:38] crashing and tell us about that huh and
[1:07:42] it's like Lord what is going on Lord
[1:07:45] God all kind of mess so I've done that
[1:07:48] but our Prophet is say clean your lives
[1:07:50] up it should be clean clean clean what
[1:07:54] does clean mean that means your husband
[1:07:55] your wife they can walk in it's clean
[1:07:57] they're not under all kind of stress and
[1:07:59] pressure and all kind of things that
[1:08:00] we've
[1:08:01] caused
[1:08:03] no we cause it and regardless of whether
[1:08:07] your spouse is different than you see I
[1:08:10] I'm trained in business and things like
[1:08:12] that that I promise you brothers and
[1:08:14] sisters God give you a spouse he knows
[1:08:16] what you need
[1:08:19] period my wife is all butterflies and
[1:08:22] love and all that I got none of
[1:08:26] it so we are a great couple you are by
[1:08:31] the grace of the Lord but she keeps me
[1:08:33] sof and I know that I know it I know I
[1:08:35] don't know what I would be probably I I
[1:08:37] don't know without her amen but she
[1:08:39] brings that side and I look back like
[1:08:41] man if I would have got her involved her
[1:08:44] own emotions would have kept me out of
[1:08:45] that trouble yes she was like uh and
[1:08:48] you're like well why logically explain
[1:08:50] it to me no she ain't never GNA
[1:08:51] logically explain it to you you g say I
[1:08:52] just don't like it
[1:08:55] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:08:56] logic but you know but that's how we
[1:08:59] feel that's the differences in
[1:09:00] relationships that we go through you
[1:09:03] know and it challenges you you know it
[1:09:05] challenges you sometimes we think and
[1:09:07] our always laugh with the brother
[1:09:08] sometimes like if my wife if she would
[1:09:11] listen to me any of you Brothers think
[1:09:13] that you're
[1:09:15] wrong if she would listen to me it would
[1:09:18] all be good that's how we feel no it
[1:09:22] would not you would have a nightmare on
[1:09:25] your hands if they only listen to you my
[1:09:29] goodness no we got to listen to God so
[1:09:33] your wife is there to drive you to
[1:09:35] prayer to say Lord God am I just
[1:09:39] overthinking I'm I missing this side
[1:09:41] Lord Jesus well you slow me down we
[1:09:43] don't need to be in a rush clean your
[1:09:45] lives up pay your debts come on man oh
[1:09:49] no man so why should we ever enter into
[1:09:52] this if we're out of it right and why
[1:09:55] are we not cleaning it up so we don't
[1:09:57] have it when he told us this in
[1:09:59] 1965 get all things
[1:10:02] right make ready get ready see fighting
[1:10:06] words as I said look at these words
[1:10:07] clean that's something you have to do
[1:10:10] clean see you're hearing it now but none
[1:10:13] of you are doing it cuz you're just
[1:10:14] hearing it this is the point that you're
[1:10:16] hearing the word you're hearing it but
[1:10:18] you got to recognize you got is this
[1:10:20] meaning something to me but then you got
[1:10:22] to go do this you got to go clean your
[1:10:24] lives up you got to go pay your debts

[1:10:37] this stuff that's just complicating our
[1:10:41] lives because remember in the name of
[1:10:44] the Lord something is fixing to happen
[1:10:47] remember that long
[1:10:50] time but we have to decide to do that we
[1:10:53] got to take these words and make that
[1:10:54] trigger something in you that you fight
[1:10:57] you do these
[1:10:59] things God's part and your part remember
[1:11:03] that that's what you hear when you hear
[1:11:04] the word of God it's easy for us to
[1:11:07] confuse and we hear God's part we like
[1:11:10] yeah huh God is always faithful with his
[1:11:12] part I can promise you that always the
[1:11:15] problem it's our part that's where the
[1:11:18] problem comes it's our part amen and we
[1:11:21] like to hear the pillow part we like to
[1:11:22] hear God's part that's pillow pillow
[1:11:24] talk to me yes it's like thank you Lord
[1:11:27] you got it all under control I don't
[1:11:29] have to worry I Lord I'm really not
[1:11:31] thinking about it Lord you're going to
[1:11:33] provide you yes he's going to do all
[1:11:35] that he has his part but you got yours
[1:11:38] amen believe that brother amen and I'd
[1:11:42] say come you got something to do too God
[1:11:45] just don't poke things down your neck
[1:11:48] you've got to believe it you've got to
[1:11:51] do some fighting amen that's our Prophet
[1:11:54] you've got to do some
[1:11:57] fighting someday I'm going to answer for
[1:11:59] every penny of money that's given to me
[1:12:01] that's what our Prophet said someday
[1:12:03] every penny that's been given to him
[1:12:06] he's going to have to answer for that
[1:12:08] think about it think about it we're in
[1:12:10] the same boat brother God's part okay
[1:12:14] just like Joshua now listen to this
[1:12:16] God's word and I don't want mean to say
[1:12:18] pillow talking that way but if we take
[1:12:19] it wrong it becomes pillow woke like we
[1:12:21] we we we tend to want to sit back and
[1:12:23] like yes God is saying this there shall
[1:12:26] not any man be able to stand before thee
[1:12:28] all the days of thy life as I was with
[1:12:31] Moses so I will be with thee I will not
[1:12:33] fail thee nor forsake
[1:12:35] thee and then shall you have good
[1:12:38] success look at what God is saying look
[1:12:40] at his part it becomes easy to say well
[1:12:43] see and that's I I I believe that being
[1:12:46] around this message a long time you know
[1:12:50] it's so easy that we we go to that part
[1:12:53] cuz it's easy easy it's easier for us to
[1:12:54] just repeat what God Said and he his
[1:12:57] part while he's working okay he's
[1:12:59] working to fulfill his part amen okay
[1:13:02] he's offering grace mercy he's paying
[1:13:05] the price for us think about it he's
[1:13:07] doing that he's paid the price for us
[1:13:10] all of these things he did his part amen
[1:13:13] he's done it okay but he wants us to
[1:13:16] experience some of that glory amen he
[1:13:20] could end it right now amen but he wants
[1:13:23] us to understand that he is Victorious
[1:13:26] he is a mighty conqueror in him in us we
[1:13:29] are the
[1:13:30] same okay when we're at work and we're
[1:13:32] trying to set someone up for a promotion
[1:13:34] or something like that what we tend to
[1:13:36] do we see somebody they working hard we
[1:13:38] give them extra jobs and things like
[1:13:40] that so their talent can come out right
[1:13:42] okay we present okay work on this
[1:13:44] project y do this do that setting them
[1:13:47] up setting them up all of the tests and
[1:13:50] trials that's what God's trying to do
[1:13:52] just set us up up so we can be a
[1:13:55] participant in this great plan that he
[1:13:58] has God's part talked about that your
[1:14:01] part here's Joshua and now he comes and
[1:14:04] say God Joshua you got a part be strong
[1:14:08] and a good courage be strong and very
[1:14:11] courageous observe to do now I hope
[1:14:13] you're hearing these fighting words that
[1:14:15] he's telling Joshua he's like Joshua
[1:14:17] nope you're not going to be able to sit
[1:14:18] down buddy I'm sorry I know you want to
[1:14:21] and I got you that's how is I got you
[1:14:23] don't worry I got you but this is what I
[1:14:25] want you to do right see God is
[1:14:28] expecting us amen we're expecting God he
[1:14:31] expecting us he's like I got my part
[1:14:33] don't worry about my part yeah you worry
[1:14:35] about what I'm telling you to
[1:14:37] do and you will see be strong observe to
[1:14:40] do stay in the word meditate day and
[1:14:42] night observe to do be strong do not be
[1:14:44] afraid do not be a dismayed look at all
[1:14:47] of these things that he puts out there
[1:14:49] for us that we have to take as fighting
[1:14:53] words see there's no reason right now
[1:14:56] that you need to be courageous cuz
[1:14:57] you're sitting all in here we got the
[1:14:58] air conditioner on we you know hopefully
[1:15:00] you're fighting to stay awake you know
[1:15:02] there hope you're fighting that good
[1:15:04] fight but when you walk out this is
[1:15:08] where you now have to recognize and put
[1:15:10] into action what you're hearing observe
[1:15:11] these things stay in the word of God as
[1:15:13] you hear the word see it says faith come
[1:15:15] by hearing as you hear the word what is
[1:15:18] Faith see it said faith comes by hearing
[1:15:20] but what is Faith to me that's the
[1:15:22] ability again to obey God it's the
[1:15:24] ability to walk into it okay so you're
[1:15:27] hearing something but Joshua had to be
[1:15:30] strong he had to have courage he had to
[1:15:34] observe he had to choose to stay in the
[1:15:36] word he had to choose not to be afraid
[1:15:39] he had to choose not to be
[1:15:41] dismayed all sound very
[1:15:43] challenging and we're in the same boat
[1:15:46] but if we can see what God is to us and
[1:15:49] see that he is there to supply that
[1:15:52] power that you need
[1:15:54] then you know if you can have that
[1:15:55] confidence in God and act in it your
[1:15:57] muscles will
[1:15:58] grow praise the Lord Jesus all right I
[1:16:03] see we're getting time is is going
[1:16:05] praise the Lord everybody's still here
[1:16:07] by the grace of the Lord nobody has left
[1:16:10] amen so as we get more towards money
[1:16:14] again you know I have to be able to show
[1:16:18] you whether or not you need to recognize
[1:16:20] this I got to be able to show you like
[1:16:22] hey he talking about your mama yeah I
[1:16:25] know you're not a fighter but he talking
[1:16:27] about your mama so I'm talking to you
[1:16:29] I'm talking to every person here whether
[1:16:32] you're young whether you're old it
[1:16:34] doesn't matter I'm talking to you but
[1:16:36] you still might not be able to relate so
[1:16:38] we got to do something when you go to
[1:16:40] the doctor they do something to find out
[1:16:41] and tell you if you're sick or not so we
[1:16:44] like to call this life Financial bondage
[1:16:46] symptoms okay and I want to take a
[1:16:48] little time to go through this so you
[1:16:51] can see whether
[1:16:53] any any when you checking that button
[1:16:56] does any of this applies to you then you
[1:16:59] go to this room okay so if any of these
[1:17:03] Financial symptoms apply to you then you
[1:17:06] know it's talking to you all right
[1:17:09] number one are you always worried about
[1:17:12] money or you're not worrying about it at
[1:17:15] all either way either way see if you
[1:17:20] have money and marriage problems
[1:17:22] arguments frustration the month too much
[1:17:26] left the money is
[1:17:28] gone or you're on the other side where
[1:17:30] you think everything will work itself
[1:17:32] out I'm trusting God to provide and I
[1:17:35] say it in that tone because that's
[1:17:36] typically how it comes out that means
[1:17:38] I'm not doing anything he going to
[1:17:40] provide but I'll borrow from this I'll
[1:17:42] borrow from that I'll do this I have no
[1:17:46] limits but I'm just trusting God did you
[1:17:49] just take a vacation and now your bill
[1:17:52] is not due but you went to the church to
[1:17:54] borrow some I don't know it sounds like
[1:17:57] you trus in something different right
[1:17:59] see that's what we got to question these
[1:18:01] things okay I'm trusting God to provide
[1:18:06] again remember you are expecting God
[1:18:09] he's done his part he's faithful God Is
[1:18:12] providing but he is expecting you to do
[1:18:15] something remember that so again always
[1:18:18] worried about money or not worried about
[1:18:20] it at all number two bailout right this
[1:18:22] is the out this is just ignoring
[1:18:25] reality okay avoiding the pressure of
[1:18:28] dealing with the issues like I just just
[1:18:30] don't want to deal with it I just honey
[1:18:33] I don't want to talk about it just I
[1:18:35] don't want to talk about it you know
[1:18:36] it's gonna work out just I got it no and
[1:18:40] you
[1:18:41] don't okay God is waiting on you and
[1:18:43] your spouse to be United amen as he said
[1:18:47] he will answer your prayers okay when
[1:18:49] you honor that weaker vessel amen okay
[1:18:52] so we don't have it figured out right we
[1:18:54] can't ignore these things okay and it's
[1:18:56] the reality it's the
[1:18:58] truth we think we can ignore these
[1:19:00] things but I always tell my wife I like
[1:19:01] to remind her that I I am a human being
[1:19:05] don't ever think of me any higher than I
[1:19:07] am I mean I'm trying to do the best that
[1:19:08] I know how period so I have to think in
[1:19:12] terms of that I am not Superman God is
[1:19:15] Superman so I don't want to leave her if
[1:19:17] something were to happen God said hey
[1:19:18] it's time for you to go home I don't
[1:19:20] want if she don't have a clue she's in a
[1:19:22] mess that has happened my brothers and
[1:19:24] sisters period okay so we can't ignore
[1:19:28] it we got to deal with these challenges
[1:19:31] we can't ignore we can't look for the
[1:19:33] big bail out you know this is the big
[1:19:35] one this will fix all my problems I
[1:19:36] don't need to do anything you know 10
[1:19:38] years been barring every left and right
[1:19:40] and every situation and you just hoping
[1:19:43] this will happen this deal will do it no
[1:19:48] it won't you know I when when when I was
[1:19:50] in business I I was thinking you know I
[1:19:52] said Lord he's going to bless me I'm a
[1:19:55] Christian this is how I'm going to buy
[1:19:57] that vehicle that's what I said he's
[1:19:59] going to bless the deal is going to work
[1:20:01] out like he this is how it's going to
[1:20:02] happen okay I hadn't learned any of this
[1:20:05] stuff it didn't happen that way it
[1:20:07] didn't happen it happened the opposite
[1:20:10] way and I learned that I had the tools
[1:20:12] to do it in a way that's going to build
[1:20:14] character and that's a much better way
[1:20:17] so don't ignore it don't don't avoid the
[1:20:20] pressure don't be looking for the big
[1:20:22] one the ba out don't jump at every
[1:20:24] investment opportunity to get rich quick
[1:20:26] and then I'll tell them I'll let them
[1:20:27] know then I love my wife when I'm bailed
[1:20:30] out now so number two number three cover
[1:20:34] up you know this is cover up you broke
[1:20:36] but you have to represent we know that's
[1:20:38] a big one in this day and time that
[1:20:40] means hey you you you looked apart you
[1:20:42] go to YouTube man you see those guys
[1:20:44] with those cars in the background I mean
[1:20:46] especially these young people it's so
[1:20:47] hard for them because they see all this

[1:21:04] that I got the secret sauce for you and
[1:21:06] I promise you you listen to that stuff
[1:21:08] you would tend to like yes this is it it
[1:21:11] got to be true no no no no God is God he
[1:21:16] provides for his children don't look for
[1:21:18] the easy way don't cover
[1:21:20] up amen I like say this is act your wage
[1:21:24] you know whatever wage that you have act
[1:21:27] that way okay don't look for credit just
[1:21:30] because you think it gets results okay
[1:21:33] you feel like oh well it gets results I
[1:21:34] can have that car I can have this I can
[1:21:36] have that no we wanted God's way
[1:21:39] remember what Satan tried to do right he
[1:21:41] tried to offer Jesus the whole Kingdom
[1:21:43] on credit it's like all he did said
[1:21:46] Jesus look I I'll give you what you
[1:21:49] worry about I got you this is easy all
[1:21:52] you you got to do Jesus is just sign
[1:21:54] right here all of the kingdom is yours
[1:21:57] why you want to go that hard way stress
[1:21:59] that was for the old folks that's how
[1:22:02] they used to do it you don't need to do
[1:22:03] that now this 2024 Jesus just accept the
[1:22:07] kingdom
[1:22:08] it's he's not telling you the price my
[1:22:12] goodness think about if our Lord wasn't
[1:22:14] a mighty
[1:22:16] fighter my goodness said now our Prophet
[1:22:20] said that Jesus said our prophet he said
[1:22:23] this and I loved it he said what's just
[1:22:26] a few more years he knew he was going to
[1:22:27] get air to and inherit it he said what's
[1:22:30] a few more years look what our Lord did
[1:22:33] for us so nope I'm not taking the easy
[1:22:36] way I'm going to show my children how
[1:22:38] things are done right he's our example
[1:22:42] praise the Lord greed hey if you feel
[1:22:45] like I deserve it it should be me more
[1:22:49] more you can't have enough you don't
[1:22:51] have that contentment
[1:22:53] you know you just H you see the next
[1:22:56] magazine you're like oh this is how it
[1:22:58] should look I'm going to change this you
[1:22:59] just can't keep that contentment this is
[1:23:01] getting outdated this is you know all
[1:23:03] this stuff just pulling on you now I'm
[1:23:05] not saying it's anything wrong with
[1:23:07] change and Improvement nothing wrong
[1:23:09] with that but you just don't want any of
[1:23:11] the devil's way you don't want any of
[1:23:13] his tactics you want that peace where
[1:23:16] it's love where you feel good just like
[1:23:19] a child you said you feel good with God
[1:23:22] giving you something you see that's what
[1:23:25] we want not a feeling well I I my
[1:23:28] husband don't he's not happy she's not
[1:23:30] happy you know all these kind of things
[1:23:31] no we just wait on the Lord wait for
[1:23:33] that right timing resentment okay you
[1:23:37] feeling resentment pointing fingers God
[1:23:39] not giving you all your wants you feel
[1:23:41] envious of
[1:23:43] others you know and all these things are
[1:23:45] going to be applied spiritually as well
[1:23:47] that's right you know like how did he do
[1:23:49] that or how did she do that or you know
[1:23:52] oh all these kind of things and we got
[1:23:53] to fight off these kind of kind of
[1:23:55] spirits next is Indulgence trying to
[1:23:58] create happy moments right you can't
[1:24:01] afford it so you buy
[1:24:03] more it's called a great escape take a
[1:24:06] vacation or buy and create your own
[1:24:08] happy experience to forget about your
[1:24:11] money problems that's the entitlement
[1:24:14] mentality reward
[1:24:17] yourself you only live once why are you
[1:24:21] waiting yeah
[1:24:23] why are you waiting for you only live
[1:24:25] once well I want to live according to
[1:24:28] God's plan that's what I want to do I
[1:24:30] don't want to create my own happy
[1:24:32] moments I want God to be with me I want
[1:24:35] God to anything I do I want to be a
[1:24:37] blessing and I Lord I want your hand in
[1:24:40] it because I don't want to be thrown off
[1:24:42] course in this most deceiving age that
[1:24:44] we live in and I certainly don't want to
[1:24:47] take your greatest thing that you've
[1:24:48] given me and I think it's just a picture
[1:24:49] book I don't want to take that I want to
[1:24:52] see your word for what it is and if that
[1:24:54] means just waiting a little bit longer
[1:24:55] Lord to start seeing your word for what
[1:24:57] it is then Lord that's what I want to
[1:24:59] see I want to see Lord you're able to
[1:25:00] provide for my needs in the greatest
[1:25:03] things I want to see that for my own
[1:25:06] self so that I have the muscles to
[1:25:08] handle Lord what you have for
[1:25:11] me no
[1:25:14] plan too busy and this is a very good
[1:25:16] one and this is a good one especially as
[1:25:19] we get closer to financial Jubilee and
[1:25:21] some of the homework and the things that
[1:25:24] I got to challenge you on okay not
[1:25:27] having a plan you don't know what's
[1:25:30] happening you're too busy or too
[1:25:34] slothful okay to have a plan you don't
[1:25:37] know where it's going like to say hey
[1:25:39] I'm not a numbers
[1:25:41] person you know you don't know what's
[1:25:44] going to happen when you're
[1:25:47] gone again you're not a numbers person
[1:25:49] but guess who is a numbers persons God
[1:25:52] he is a numbers
[1:25:53] person and you know the Devil he's a
[1:25:55] perverter so he's right and long being a
[1:25:58] numbers person he spends
[1:26:00] billions billions to learn you how to
[1:26:04] Market how to get out of your
[1:26:06] hands what God wants you to have
[1:26:10] billions studying marketing pushing
[1:26:15] planning this whole economy is based on
[1:26:17] that right okay so he's taking his time
[1:26:21] in a plan but we don't take our time we
[1:26:23] don't want a plan it feels just odd no
[1:26:26] God wants you to have a
[1:26:28] plan okay he wants you to have a plan he
[1:26:31] wants you to be
[1:26:34] diligent in everything that we do
[1:26:37] middleman this is living paycheck to
[1:26:39] paycheck that means everything that's
[1:26:41] coming in is going out sorry about that
[1:26:44] everything that's coming in is going out
[1:26:47] okay that's not where we want to be as
[1:26:49] well help wanted this is where you you
[1:26:52] just don't have it to help you wish you
[1:26:55] could be a help but you don't have it to
[1:27:00] help in my spot here okay I like to call
[1:27:05] this like the the broke Good Samaritan
[1:27:07] he just s couldn't would be the Good
[1:27:08] Samaritan if he was broke yeah but he
[1:27:11] wasn't broke he was using everything
[1:27:13] that God was giving him for God's honor
[1:27:16] and glory and we know the story
[1:27:19] today and then the last is the de trap
[1:27:23] thinking it's the only way we know debt
[1:27:26] you know God does not want his children
[1:27:28] in debt as our Prophet said clean your
[1:27:31] lives pay your debts now he does say he
[1:27:34] not talking about your normal bills and
[1:27:36] you got you know your gas and your
[1:27:37] electric bills and things like that
[1:27:40] that's not debt debt is when you borrow
[1:27:43] okay you borrow and now you have a
[1:27:45] additional charge that's interest that
[1:27:48] you're now paying this interest that's a
[1:27:51] cost of you
[1:27:52] borrowing okay that's what he does not
[1:27:55] like okay and I like to like what God
[1:27:58] doesn't like I doesn't I don't like what
[1:28:01] the Lord doesn't like and I like what he
[1:28:02] likes okay so he's given that in his
[1:28:06] Bible he's telling us that I don't like
[1:28:08] that now you decide how you going to
[1:28:10] deal with what God doesn't like
[1:28:17] okay quickly we're we're coming to a
[1:28:21] close
[1:28:23] I think I'm saying that just to kind of
[1:28:25] wake you up a little bit I've saw the
[1:28:26] brothers do that we're coming to a
[1:28:29] close I don't want eyes getting glazed
[1:28:32] over you know my kids they they they've
[1:28:35] been around me a long time was going
[1:28:37] through all of this and I've learned I
[1:28:39] start seeing their eyes
[1:28:41] like
[1:28:43] Dad yeah and they start talking about
[1:28:46] the birds and I'm like huh well it's
[1:28:48] time for me to put my passion down a
[1:28:50] little bit on these kids
[1:28:52] they'll
[1:28:54] learn I'm passionate about the things of
[1:28:57] the lord it's everything to me my
[1:28:59] brothers and sisters his word is every
[1:29:01] single thing and I want everyone to know
[1:29:03] that it's every single thing it is your
[1:29:06] money it's your health it's your
[1:29:08] strength it's your life it's this
[1:29:11] journey principles we're going to go
[1:29:14] through this might hit on a couple
[1:29:16] things and then we will wind this up for
[1:29:19] today God owns it all the 10% is his and
[1:29:22] the 90% you have to manage his resources
[1:29:26] diligently the Bible says the hand of
[1:29:29] the diligent shall bear rule it says
[1:29:33] that money can be your master you cannot
[1:29:36] serve God and Manon you have to be the
[1:29:39] master of money am get that plan put
[1:29:43] things in
[1:29:44] place number four patience wait on the
[1:29:47] Lord we know that avoid debt like the
[1:29:49] curse the Bible says the blessing of the
[1:29:51] Lord maketh rich and he adth no sorrow
[1:29:55] with it that's
[1:29:56] right principle number six save winter
[1:29:59] is coming save a
[1:30:01] little go to the
[1:30:03] ant any of us as we're getting older you
[1:30:06] know you're like different than when you
[1:30:08] were when you were 20 something years
[1:30:09] old you're 30 am my dad is the hard
[1:30:12] hardest working man I I knew in his
[1:30:14] lifetime you know and to see that he is
[1:30:17] now retired you know and not able to
[1:30:19] work he would have not stopped working
[1:30:22] and if if life you know but to see that
[1:30:25] it's like my go to the ant you know
[1:30:28] think about this journey that we're on
[1:30:30] save a little bit giving is the best
[1:30:32] investment the Bible says it's more
[1:30:34] blessed to give than to receive so you
[1:30:35] want to be in a position where you're
[1:30:36] truly giving not where you got
[1:30:38] MasterCard over here taken out this
[1:30:40] pocket and you giv I don't that's kind
[1:30:42] of that's something you got to pray
[1:30:44] through right you know but where you
[1:30:46] really have it is yours that you're
[1:30:48] giving
[1:30:49] see and principle number eight
[1:30:51] contentment godliness with contentment
[1:30:54] is great gain amen that's what we're
[1:30:57] after that great
[1:31:01] gain hit on this principle then we will
[1:31:04] wrap this up but listen to God's part
[1:31:07] okay God owns it all all of it the 10%
[1:31:11] the 90% it's all it's given to you to
[1:31:14] manage look what God says he owns it he
[1:31:17] says the Earth is the Lord's and the
[1:31:19] fullness thereof the world and they that
[1:31:21] dwell therein the silver is mine and the
[1:31:24] gold is mine sayith the Lord of hosts
[1:31:26] he's saying this he owns it all he
[1:31:29] controls it both riches and honor come
[1:31:32] of thee and thou reth over all and in
[1:31:34] thine hand is power and might and in thy
[1:31:37] hand it is to make great and to give
[1:31:40] strength unto
[1:31:41] all the Lord maketh poor and maketh Rich
[1:31:45] he bringeth low and he lifteth up amen
[1:31:49] he provides it but my God shall supply
[1:31:51] all your need according to his riches
[1:31:53] and Glory by Christ
[1:31:56] Jesus but Thou shalt remember the Lord
[1:31:58] thy God for it is he that giveth power
[1:32:01] to get wealth he owns it he controls it
[1:32:06] he provides
[1:32:08] it he says anything that you
[1:32:12] need anything you have need of in this
[1:32:15] earth Journey God Will Supply it if you
[1:32:18] have need of it he promises to supply
[1:32:20] your needs not your wants your needs and
[1:32:24] he's God and he can only get it to you
[1:32:28] as you would believe him amen that's a
[1:32:32] promise these are promises that we have
[1:32:35] from God he owns it he controls it like
[1:32:38] I said a billion dollars what's that to
[1:32:40] God what's that to God we should really
[1:32:43] really honestly have that that we know
[1:32:45] that's a small thing that's nothing to
[1:32:47] the Lord we want this power we want what
[1:32:49] God has for us so we can get all of the
[1:32:51] these precious promises that God has for
[1:32:53] us we want that freedom that God wants
[1:32:56] for us in our life so we can train our
[1:32:58] children so we can have that type of
[1:33:00] Faith muscles in all areas of our life
[1:33:03] right see Satan wants all these things
[1:33:05] to be stumbling block blocks and
[1:33:07] distractions to where we just don't
[1:33:08] necessarily have that freedom we don't
[1:33:11] have that that true
[1:33:12] Freedom okay and and our kids can tell
[1:33:16] our our grandkids they could they could
[1:33:17] tell you know they're looking you know
[1:33:20] they're looking at our home our
[1:33:22] marriages how we handle each other
[1:33:24] they're looking at all of those things
[1:33:26] to see if we really possess what we're
[1:33:28] saying we
[1:33:30] possess you see and we want to be in a
[1:33:33] position where we can possess that where
[1:33:35] we have that but we know we have to be
[1:33:38] trained in these areas and money again
[1:33:40] that's just a tool it's just a tool for
[1:33:43] you to use to practice to see God in all
[1:33:47] of the things all of the things from the
[1:33:49] big things to the little things you can
[1:33:51] see God God
[1:33:53] yes we're going to jump down I do want
[1:33:56] to read one
[1:34:01] thing we'll read this quote says if God
[1:34:04] gives us things to do and gives us money
[1:34:07] so you said who gives you the money
[1:34:09] that's what I'm telling you God gives
[1:34:10] you the money and he gives you things to
[1:34:12] do and he makes us the richest nation
[1:34:14] under the heavens then God's going to
[1:34:16] ask what did we do with it why did we
[1:34:19] spend our money for things that
[1:34:20] satisfies not
[1:34:22] not only to a nation but that'll be to
[1:34:26] individuals if God gives us these things
[1:34:29] God is giving us that money that's right
[1:34:32] he's the one that's doing
[1:34:35] that America is in a bad situation and
[1:34:37] they call it a debt
[1:34:39] pandemic like the national debt has
[1:34:42] never been the high as high as it's been
[1:34:44] and the Consumer Debt that's like
[1:34:46] personal debt your cars houses credit
[1:34:48] cards all that it's never been as high
[1:34:51] as it is is this month period they call
[1:34:53] it the debt pandemic you can Google it
[1:34:55] and look it up and see what's going on
[1:34:57] but it's it's a lot and there there it's
[1:35:00] we been know it's out of control you see
[1:35:02] and we know our Prophet said he said
[1:35:04] right there in the money that will get
[1:35:06] the ball rolling it'll get that ball
[1:35:10] rolling you see so we want to certainly
[1:35:13] be like Abraham we're over here on this
[1:35:15] side we're not caught up in all of these
[1:35:18] things and wrapped up caught up stressed
[1:35:21] out bound down you see if these things
[1:35:24] that God has promised us if they know
[1:35:26] they're coming as our Prophet said
[1:35:27] something is coming in the name of the
[1:35:28] Lord we heard him say that if he said
[1:35:31] that then it's just been Grace given to
[1:35:33] us that we're still here that we can
[1:35:36] listen to these things that we can come
[1:35:38] out fighting as Nehemiah said fighting
[1:35:41] for each
[1:35:42] other fighting for your brethren
[1:35:44] fighting for one another fighting for
[1:35:46] your wives your children and he said and
[1:35:48] your houses I love that he had your
[1:35:50] fight fight fight for these
[1:35:52] things if it's your car fight for it
[1:35:55] don't let it be at you know American
[1:35:57] Express's car or whoever the loan that's
[1:35:59] not your car yet if you got that debt on
[1:36:01] it get that thing paid off so it's yours
[1:36:04] amen if you got a house hey start
[1:36:06] working on it start fighting to get that
[1:36:08] thing paid off free ourselves clean it
[1:36:11] up yes it takes the key word sacrifice
[1:36:15] but that's where you start seeing God's
[1:36:17] grace that's where you start seeing his
[1:36:19] Mercy these these blessings that he give
[1:36:21] to you because you're on his path see
[1:36:23] there's nothing too hard for the
[1:36:26] Lord and I believe that Jubilee I
[1:36:29] believe that Jubilee is something if we
[1:36:31] can have that experience of that
[1:36:35] Jubilee I think it would really do
[1:36:37] something in our
[1:36:39] lives I love this and we'll we'll close
[1:36:41] the musicians they can come on
[1:36:50] up
[1:36:55] can't get my Masterwork here but let's
[1:36:57] go
[1:37:06] on I am going to have some sheets of
[1:37:09] paper in the back I I do want to go and
[1:37:11] pass this out because I do want it to be
[1:37:14] something tangible that you can start on
[1:37:17] I'm going to make it very simple
[1:37:20] actually brother Michael if you don't
[1:37:20] mind passing this out for
[1:37:25] me yeah that's right yep one for
[1:37:42] family and this is just the action word
[1:37:44] so what what this is that I'm I'm going
[1:37:47] to give each
[1:37:50] person
[1:37:53] I don't know why this thing
[1:38:03] is what I'm passing out is is what's
[1:38:06] called a spending plan okay and what it
[1:38:09] is once you get it you'll see that it
[1:38:11] has a lot of different categories on
[1:38:14] it and it has all pretty much all of the
[1:38:17] spending areas that you could spin
[1:38:20] things on so so I I really want you to
[1:38:22] start getting familiar with it that's
[1:38:24] that's the goal just to get familiar
[1:38:25] with it to start looking at it easy easy
[1:38:28] assignment to see if you do you see any
[1:38:30] other expenses that you have in your
[1:38:31] life that's not listed here so it's
[1:38:33] talking about mortgage you have second
[1:38:35] mortgage home insurance real estate
[1:38:37] taxes ground rent electricity water bill
[1:38:40] sanitation Bill telephone bill look at
[1:38:42] all these things that wants your money
[1:38:44] auto payments gas Insurance life
[1:38:47] insurance Dr dentist eating out lunch
[1:38:51] snacks movies babysitting subscriptions
[1:38:54] activities you name
[1:38:56] it it's all the categories that should
[1:38:59] cover pretty much all of your expenses
[1:39:01] all of the money that's going out so you
[1:39:04] can take a pencil and you can go back if
[1:39:07] you want to do more work just try to see
[1:39:08] if you could fill this out you don't
[1:39:10] have to do it but I want you get more
[1:39:11] familiar with the categories because as
[1:39:13] we continue with financial Jubilee we're
[1:39:15] going to go into some of this some of
[1:39:16] the spending and just looking at it
[1:39:18] because I want you to see a plan I want
[1:39:21] you to see your own household plan even
[1:39:24] if you've never done anything like this
[1:39:25] before in your life just to be able to
[1:39:27] see like wow okay okay and then husband
[1:39:31] and wife you can have something like
[1:39:32] this that you both can see your wife can
[1:39:34] know what's going on and if hey we can't
[1:39:37] have secrets we got pray God help us you
[1:39:40] know we we got to be able to to work
[1:39:42] together um through some of these things
[1:39:44] and all of these things is what God
[1:39:45] wants us to have you know to where we
[1:39:47] can kind of relate to each other we can
[1:39:49] make decisions together and things like
[1:39:51] that but I want you to take that take a
[1:39:54] pencil and see if you're able to fill
[1:39:55] out some of those things for your
[1:39:57] expenses that you spend on a month okay
[1:40:01] and and this will show you so and I know
[1:40:03] some people may have variable incomes
[1:40:05] that means their money fluctuates you
[1:40:06] don't have to worry about your income
[1:40:07] for now I'm worrying about what you
[1:40:08] spend out what you spend okay so your
[1:40:12] food your groceries start thinking about
[1:40:14] those things oh how much do we spend on
[1:40:16] groceries a month huh how much do we
[1:40:18] spend eating out a month huh okay uh how
[1:40:21] much is our electricity electricity bill
[1:40:23] gas start getting an idea of those
[1:40:25] things if you got receipts keep those
[1:40:26] receipts it'll help you you know and God
[1:40:29] wants us to be diligent in everything
[1:40:31] that we do and this becomes a framework
[1:40:34] for you to help you on this journey I
[1:40:37] want to conclude by just sharing you you
[1:40:40] know with our Prophet I want you to see
[1:40:42] something that just has been a blessing
[1:40:44] to
[1:40:46] me brother Brenham as we know he had
[1:40:49] that tax situation
[1:40:51] and he came home he said 'I looking
[1:40:54] forward this week to a Revival in my own
[1:40:58] soul I told my wife yesterday when I
[1:41:01] heard some good news and I rushed over
[1:41:03] and threw my arms around her and I
[1:41:05] screamed I'm free and went out into the
[1:41:08] room and started weeping and I said you
[1:41:11] know I want God to give me a Revival in
[1:41:15] myself I said for about five years I've
[1:41:18] been choked down under a great burden
[1:41:22] that's been released now the message
[1:41:26] itself should give you a clue return and

[1:41:40] what started happening in 63 but look
[1:41:43] what he's telling you something released
[1:41:46] that choked down feeling that he had in
[1:41:48] his life I believe paid away paved away
[1:41:52] for his spirit amen to be in an attitude
[1:41:55] a mindset to receive what we are living
[1:41:58] off of today amen that's what it did he
[1:42:02] got free by the grace of the Lord said
[1:42:04] Billy you're free a couple days later he
[1:42:07] said your pardon oh my something run
[1:42:09] over me I ran into the room and grabbed
[1:42:11] my wife around the neck and said honey

[1:42:16] been settled I can now go wherever I
[1:42:20] want to wherever the Lord leads me I'm
