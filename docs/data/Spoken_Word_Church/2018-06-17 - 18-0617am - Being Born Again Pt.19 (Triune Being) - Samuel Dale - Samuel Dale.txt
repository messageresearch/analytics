truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see if you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible how by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever alright let's go over to Thessalonians because we're going to kind of just take a little thought in the line here and want to bring it out so from 1st Thessalonians 5 we'll start reading about verse 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man no see that don't say well I can be bad to this guy cause he ain't my brother no such thing any man would ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quints not the Spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify now once watch the whole thing now because this is our thought let see and the very God of peace sanctify you they didn't just say now the soul or this or that it's holy the whole being all right now cuz that's our thought see and I pray that you're whole and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word no we've been covering for quite a while and kind of staying in the line of you know making sure we're getting the line up correctly in the new birth and getting those things to bring us to a position you know then that way when we do get into the talkin of the virtues and the things like that it won't be something there so well we wonder about this what about now you'll see that it's already there because that's what we're trying to speak about all right the prophet of God said when you receive that new birth he said you good everything that you have need of all right but that doesn't mean you've got everything right you've got what the point or the ability or the situation exists then to where that you can receive from God because that nuber just puts you to the place to work you can start your growing right you can start your growing in Christ and and walking in his love and you know and letting him lead us and guide us this is a natural child you know go forth and trying to explain that in the new birth because that to me is the most wonderful thing the new birth the Prophet said it's the most important thing in your life it's whether you're born again or not know that if you have that then he gets into the statue of a perfect man and he says then if you have this faith this new birth and I'll said don't worry about these other things because they'll be automatically added now listen to the wording automatically added he didn't say added automatically that's entirely different when you say they'll be you know they'll be added automatically they automatically add it to different things to your thoughts are different right see then you know they'll be added because there's something in there that can receive you know something can receive the eat the teachings and the walk in Christ and the things and in that way it will bring out what God wants into our hearts and lives all right we'll see it's not just say well I don't have to worry about it cause it'd be automatically added now that wasn't the way that's not the thought the I mean if what you're saying see if people don't realize when they say something what it means on the other side what you're saying is well my wife just had a baby but we don't feed it it's automatically we won't feed it will not do that be automatically added no they you know that's kind of stupidity right well maybe it's a bad word to use but it's true all right you feed the baby all right so what is it in the Christian life you feed the child and it'll grow up into him which is the word all right now doing that in the new birth then see we can follow it and see that God will just keep unveiling that and if he has given you now this was the point last last weekend see if he has given you the new birth he gave it to you for a reason if he has chosen us he chose us for a reason how does God choose well he just hand-picked he just coded I'll get this don't get everything no no how does God choose he chooses by his foreknowledge because that's the way he can predestinate things to take place and that is his choosing is through his foreknowledge not it just a world was laying out and he said I'll take this I'll take that and I'll take it that looks pretty good okay then who does no no no that's not the way God does he looked down through time and saw what we would be and what we would desire and that way he doesn't even predestinate to prophet said by his own desires he predestinated by your desire alright then that's what we were trying to get across you know that there everybody were predestinated unto adoption alright and adoption then is told in three stages we'll go back to that in a second but yet see if there's people predestinated to all places in Christ there is a field you that's predestinated but God's foreknowledge he knows where they'll come to alright there's a foolish virgin that he knows will receive eternal life one day and those are predestinated by his foreknowledge right and siiver then by the same thing you and i are predestinated you remember how we were bringing it some will just receive the new birth praise God that's wonderful because that's their position and that's as high as they can go that's that's the level all right then others are predestinated to reach into manifestation of God you know in growth development into maturity and it will be all up and down the pyramids you know as far as see summer predestinate adjust to the new birth with someone predestinate here and here here and here and here and here and on but somebody is predestinated for it to come to the headstone the capstone the finish of it all all right now that's the group of people I want to be in I'm not going to be disappointed if I don't make it because I know now listen if I don't make it in the change you know the point and live long enough have to go by the gray there's no problem but I know too that I'm the one that will determine it's not God determining who's going to reach that position you sold yes it is he picked he picked specially for that no he picked because there's something special to be picking right he picks because of what he wants to pick he'll bring it to that place all right would it be because somebody believed it I always been in the Bible I've always tried to emphasize that to you it's always been my thoughts then in the Bible God doesn't use this anybody distill what I'll just pick out one no he knows what we will do and thereby he can choose by what he knows we desire but you know you don't amount to anything unless God you know comes to you and he offers it to you it's not that he makes you take salvation it's not he he demands you do this editor he offers it to you all right he knows surely whether you receive it or not yes but he offers it and then as we accept it it can become a part of us and that way we become his offspring his children right and becoming his children then you know he's not just hand picking this or hand taking that he's picking it because of some reason brother Tom Fogg was had a way of saying it about predestination he said you trigger your predestination well you know I mean you you trigger it you you're the one that sets it in motion the God lays before us all things isn't well that don't sound like predestination way I believe it because I think pre that we did predestinate it well you've got a problem because you're profit you know yourself said it if you want he said God doesn't predestinate by his desires because he desired it everybody be saved he doesn't predestinate you know well I won't pick this when I'm gonna pick that one no no he doesn't he has some reason well when are we going to realize that church that has been my desire since I came into the message and begin to see what the Prophet was talking about that God is waiting on somebody and we talk about the Bible today without us or not made perfect you know that they're waiting on well you know what God is waiting on you and other prophets their God waiting on your not yes God is waiting on you and I he's waiting on us to wake up you remember a few weeks ago the message we're out in denominations asleep oh no no we're really up here in a little denomination sleeping wake up and realize you know that we've got to walk in him he's wounding somebody and don't worry about it if we just have the right desire he'll bring it to pass making it manifest in their lives see that's the whole of a Christian journey is not to try to make ourselves known to the world as some kind of a super-duper a group of people or something like that I've never had that dog my thoughts are to make my father known it's always been that way to make my father known I mean maybe God allows things to happen where you come out differ but see my dad died when I was like four well I don't remember him you know you remember your dad your your thing no my mother I can remember but my dad I don't remember him why see maybe God allowed that to take place to her that I would have a thoughts about my father see I want to make my father manifest I thought that's what the Christian journey was far I thought you know that he was to come and live in us to make himself manifest to everybody else and that's been my desire because I you know it's just within me to to want to try to express Jesus Christ to her that you can see him and want to follow after not me what good is it father after each other that's well and good I mean we've got it oh you call them image personalities or something before us you know that we look at things and want to be like that that's not human but being a Christian is to let God live in us to work that he can manifest himself we were listening the other day too to him back and I've told you over and over where that why I'm right people so tossed about 60 I mean 56 you know they're totally that's where brother Adam would start off talking we were listening to the other Jorgenson's and that was part of our talking about and see he says their ins in 56 God walking on two feet God in his people walking on two feet you know I mean that's his desire if there's any desire whatsoever I think about God if he wants his people to make him manifest to where others want to walk in that I know that I hurt feelings and things by saying things but I'm sorry but is it true is it true that maybe sometimes we prove we present the wrong the wrong way even to our families or our children or our brothers and sisters or something this is the reason they don't want this message it's because that we've killed them with the word that we thought we were trying to save them and we wind up burying them instead of saving them but yet still listen the whole goal of a Christian should be to let their father come and live through them Jesus he said I do nothing until my father shows me that was something he was the father but yet he was so into the human connections by the body that he lived with him that he wanted that body to manifest what was with the end we'll get to the message maybe in a minute see to the whole being I believe in salvation for the whole being I mean that we talk about coming to a change of the body well wouldn't that be the point to were that the whole being the whole being that I am I wanted to manifest God to her others can look at it you know the kids the grandkids and think and look at and say what would you know daddy's got a problem that is getting old and he's got a lot of problems but you don't want he still a good Oh daddy you know I mean that's at least what we should have a desire within our heart to be you know and that way then you're not ruling or lording over your children you know right I've never believed in in trying to make anybody do anything no I thought I've always been I know you say well you're wrong okay I'm wrong what I am I'm just me I've never tried to make anybody believe this message I've never tried to make my family believe this message I've always left it before them to work that take it except to reject and really in reality you know the reason I'm preaching today you've heard me say this before so it's not a new thing just wait like I said finish it what am i preaching whoa oh I have one desire in my heart is for somebody to see Jesus Christ you said well what do you mean you preacher I thought it's called a preach hey I'm glad we've got a prophet that we can quote back with like a he said it don't matter if I preach anymore he said I'm saved anyway he said I'm not saved according to what I preach but see the then he would get the benefits of reaping a lot to go with it because of what he would do yes but yet his desire see and that's means my whole desire I've never tried to make my wife when we walked out of the Baptist Church I told her I said you go you do I'll give you money I won't give money back to the church you know I move on but I'll allow you to go there and do whatever because that's your choice so I don't want her following just a book of rules I don't want her following just me has to be a point I want her to follow Jesus Christ all right then something happens to me and I'm taken out of the way she doesn't lose right the she can go on in God and let God lead her that's the way I want a a church to be I want you to be you know love God and do what you do out of love I hate to give orders that's the difference between a Leo and Aries Leo likes to order no an Aries likes to direct you know I'd rather just do it himself then they have to tell somebody do this or do that I'm just not made that way I just go do it themselves and you know that's true see because that's part of my nature alright but it's part of my Christian nature for the one us to be one time to walk in Christ okay okay but now where we're at Sunday in trying to speak about adoption in three stages all right and we were covering that your adoption is covered in three stages all right the new birth authority and then the really it's not the change of the body I've always tried to emphasize that the Bible is really not doing it the change of the body is a mystery Paul come up to spoke of it see it's not a change of the body it's to wit I've always emphasized that in Romans to wit to understand the change see if we understand the change there's no problem with the change right but remember now to be healed you must confess you're healed before you're healed right to be saved you must confess you're saved then God can manifest that all right so he's going to reveal to somebody the change of the body and it's going to take place mm-hmm because it's already the others are in manifestation of the new birth what see then in Romans that's what we were getting at Paul talks in the Romans about the the three stages all right then think about Peter that's what my emphasis has been so much lately till maybe I'm varying too much on it but my emphases is what Paul and Peter James and John Jude any one of them you want to put there ever one with one goal in mind that's to try to get people to Christ all right now listen real careful Jude I mean a Peter noone is are they're not as concerned with getting you saved that's where our mess-ups always been we we were we tried to get everybody saved but we had no growth development right it's like I told him brothers that we were going overseas to a thing in having a meeting with people and I said that's all well and good but that's it next year are you gonna put the same two hundred people back in the same class and teach them the same thing that God was a prophet I said don't do that I said take the 200 that you've taught it this year of God being a prophet move them over into another room and then bring these hundred over here or so if you bring it in and teach them that but let somebody take these on in the word well I do know that happened to happen from a country they sent them word said you've told us about a prophet now tell us what the Prophet taught well see that's the whole point that listen Peter names not as interested in getting you saved as they're interested in the growth development of after you're saved because Peters saying you're born again he said you've got this faith you've come through the corruption that is in the world and come to Jesus Christ you've come to that but now let's don't just keep moving on that let's go on and Christ in a growth development all right isn't that what Paul was doing adoption okay this is what you become a child of God by faith in Jesus Christ you become a child of God but now let's go on the there's where the problem brother Brennan said you Pentecostals he said that's where you messed up he said thinking the new birth and you got that and all that was well and good he said he said but you've got to go on what do you mean brother down I go to church I pray I do everything what do you want me to do you know the only thing I want you to do is just me what you're supposed to be which is a Christian right and Peter and Paul Anil see all they're not as much trying to get you born again is they're trying to teach you after you're born again to move on in God and not just set back but yet that's the hardest thing in the world because it's always been thrilled to me well we need simple teaching of the new birth all right then I start like this and a series of simple teaching than you'd understand this wouldn't want I thought this would the way I meant for it to be broad you say well is it true did you say what I want no you you wanted some way that you thought was to bring it I can only do as me I'm not I'm honest I've never been one to deal with trying to get people to the altar for salvation now I do because I'm doing but my interest is in after you get to the altar is to try to teach us to walk in Christ and come forth as children of God they don't have to be patted and pampered and things like that that's why that I've always been a sorry but you know the way I've always been you come to this church by volunteering I didn't go out and get you if you don't want to come to this church that's fine there's no problems but there's one thing about it if you leave I'm not gonna try to chase you down I'm sorry I mean that's what pastors is posted oh brother Dale well maybe I'm not a pastor then but that's just Matt my way I expect children to act like children you know what I do I mean I don't there's the kids know it these little ones until I get out and play with them especially used to younger I really did let's see I I don't expect him to be halos all of their whole life you know just walk in one straight line I didn't walk it and you didn't walk it so don't start with me I've always told you you know we had our ducktail haircuts we had our bell bottom pants if we just kept them we'd be in style cause they were hanging off of that back no but you see I don't throw off on the children telling me oh you you've gotta be snow you talk to her about Jesus Christ you don't talk to him about how God hates this and hates Addison and don't you do that because God God don't like that God to be mean to you I mean you making him mad don't do that you remember when you came to Christ did that do much good in your life it sure did it run you off you had to get over it right so I wrote a run said don't do it he said don't go down and that all I'm gonna group and get that person and try to make them come to the altar he said cause you're gonna make him a twofold child he said because it's gonna be harder the next time try to get you to come to the okay just trying to express what I believe about Christianity and what we should be and adoption is taught there in three stages to where we would have something to understand so then the stature of a perfect man is in three stages new birth all right growth development manifestation of sons and daughters of God and then God coming and capping the whole thing off into our Bible that way if you read the New Testament every one of the writings there was trying their best there were not novices to just try to get you to be born again even the corrections even the raw are the Corinthians the Corinthians was written to Christians the whole Bible is written to Christians it's not written to sinners sinners receive it by seeing people as they and like I said with always been one a revival what was it for it was to revive those that were in Christ that others may see Christ and want to come and follow in their that's the revival no no revival get all that well now see that you've still got that old denominational thought well we need to disprove simple things to get the children but around preach souls in prison and the hall-door fool you understand what I'm getting at he preached some deep messages an altar before the why but calls us in Christ see we think we've got it all figured out and what see our problem is is not accepting it and moving on with God okay so with what we found out that we're predestinated to certain positions all right and when that position is reached in Christ I've always taught you tried to get you to believe when Martin Luther saw what he saw it was a position and when he reached that position he lived a while longer right but it was cause he was preaching that just shall live by faith but before sanctification moved into the picture Luther went off for the scene to where Wesley could come on the scene right because see that was as far as Luther could go but that was in Christ that sealed him away put him to the place he's supposed to be that was his position brother Owen said what about that great glorious stain he said adoption he's done adoption is that great glorious stand predestination to realize you and I our concern our thoughts should not be now listen our concerns could not be just to get people saved that was the ages and times I thought should be to get people who growth development to walking in Christ to realize what Christ is wanting to be done can you see as I said somebody's gonna come to a place one day and they're gonna see it because Roman says it there's to the adoption to wit to understand I know what it goes into we're into this and we did and that's right alright but spiritually what is it to understand the redemption of the body and you realize then what a wonderful place that we stand in that God has given to you and I the message of the hour and you see why I emphasize that so much from 327 Church age book or this messenger Malachi for Luke 17 30 I'll gonna do two thing one turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers the faith of the fathers is to read this those writings by the Apostles that would try to bring Christ into being that was their goal for that day but to the ages that begin to die down and as it died down see then it just come forth with people just what we need to be saved we don't need these other things we don't need these deep things we we just need to be saved well all that's well and good but you're just saying I need my baby I'm my baby was born I want it to stay to pi on three pound five minutes I don't want the drawing on that you're not realizing that's what we're saying we'll see the return back all right then the Prophet said how do we get these virtues he said in he was to reveal the seven thunders which the revelation contained in the seven Seth and these it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back so if we want to be turned back to the faith of the father's we want to see God move on then why are we afraid to try to hear deeper things well I don't want to be confused honey you already are so don't worry about that when you say it like that you already confused I said something the other day and I said I'm looking at it right here we'll see that that's this but listen everybody is predestinated to a position in Christ you follow isn't it okay everybody's predestinated to a position in Christ and the prophet called it crisis a mystery of God revealed paragraph 182 through 188 right in there read all of that that great glorious stand predestinated of people into adoption all right just being predestinated to be a little babe in Christ that's a great position to be involved in a growth development of Christianity to walk in our lives until we be no more his house to and fro by every wind of doctrine what keeps you from being took up into these doctrines and ideas well brother den I've got caught and if you think well maybe you ought to consider what you're doing you know I mean maybe you ought to consider the fact that you need to follow into Christ and Ernie learn a little bit more about the word all right see that might be something to keep us from getting caught by these strange doctrines because I thought that's what it was that the Christian life should walk in Christ and that Holy Ghost should keep us away from strange doctrines now we're human and we fall for things yes but then we need to move on in Christ to where we don't fall for these things there's your faith of the father's is not a group of people standing here in the end of the world and people saying well you know if we had what we think we've got then you know Y&T miracles you know why because of that very statement because we're doubting who we are we're doubting what God is doing I thought I was explaining this to my wife I thought I believe in the people right over there if God came down over there in that church and healed every person in that building one prior and every one of them was healed I wouldn't go over there to see what kind of doctrine or whatever I would thank God for his healing that he done I would praise him for what he's doing among the people but I just walk home yeah but I don't you look look there's nobody that's builder that needs healing any more than then we all need some form of healing yes but we can't make God do it but we can hinder him doing it see like I said if everybody over that would heal people that run over there let's go see what they got well that means you ain't got very much if you're going to looking for something is that the best way to say it I just say praise God because I've taught it from the beginning and I'll keep on teaching you one day the Prophet said God will anoint a church and he'll do in one year or what theologists try to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now alright now I've always looked for that he's always you know the quotes have always give you they'll come set your baptism with the Holy Ghost from heaven that'll feel every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture I've always quoted those as believing it right because I believe that will take place but I've always said this at the same time God will be revealing his bride and she will be coming into her full full future you know full fruits coming into maturity as she does the world's going the religious world of grandfather see there's the deception now I didn't write the book the Bible says this is what I sent among you to try you is that scriptural right I sent this among you to try you want to see whether you'll stay with the word or in hot what you see are we going to take the word I thought the whole thing come down you look at the prophets ministry thirty thousand one meeting thirty thousand come to Jesus Christ in one meeting but when he ended his ministry couldn't get thirty people together right now which is the greatest come on so you're into that flim flam's you love a fire with with your thinking yeah I want 30,000 did the profit turn around and walk back and say well we've been wrong I've chewed you pentecostals out and calls you this and that and the other so we'll just go back to the hour and we'll just go back down here where we're getting all of this movement going we're getting really the movement of God and which way we move with it did he do that the further he went the smaller the crowds right why was that not to move of God come on so which was God won't to be up here with bringing a message that he brought through the Prophet in the sealed book and said I've seen the dead raised the sick healed a great sound and wonderful he said but never worked in the room like this well no you think he'd walk backward well brother branham you won't sit healed and dead raises on the other don't know let's go back there what would he say it he just said y'all go ahead I'm just gonna go on the way I am because this is the way God's leading me right let's see we think it's got to be signs and wonders that's what I kept emphasizing that message about revival this is a revival of God's Word well here it goes though when if we had the word did without signs and wonders Oh see don't quote too much with me cuz all right I'm old and arrogant and hateful and I'll remind you that the Lord Jesus had to take people out of side of the city the Lord Jesus couldn't heal the cause of the people that was dark don't quote with me I'm pretty good at it okay arrogant and hateful yes sir but I'm dying to do one thing to see a people that will stand on God's Word come on is it in the Bible see we quote one scripture where if a prophet tells you anything in the name of a prophet and it comes to pice didn't you supposed to believe it right Amen we believe that that scripture but what about the scripture were that if he sends signs and wonders among you and he take you to another God said don't do it he said cause I sent him among you to try you see we quote what we want a quote we make what we want to make out of the gospel instead of listening to God in his word you to a preacher in the gospel that really stays with words not popular in this message because the people don't know what you're doing they want the signs and the wonders and the moving then is it right am i right see then which one is it which is your desire to be a child of God will stay with God's Word it doesn't make no difference what all the signs and wonders takes place because come on Church you don't realize what the Bible to say he said I sent them among you to try you God sent among us that's what I'm getting at when you do come to the places of God moving in the bride in the way that he said he would do it's going to move everywhere else and how are you going to know the to so people is going to say I told you my message is right God is doing signs and wonders seven Thunder Birchers any message any any doctrine that you got even to all of this stuff now I'll do the claiming brother branham's out and ever since either we got signs and wonders and said we done declared the all that brother branham was false prophet y'all didn't believe us we said now we got signs and wonders brother Daryl you mean to tell me yes sir I've always looked for one time for God to move among his people and manifest himself the way he wants to I've always believed it I always look for because I believe in the mind the signs and the miracles and the wonders I believe in Christ but yet it's so hard to get people to settle down to just listen check what somebody says by the word instead of checking them by your feelings or your ideas well that brother I just didn't feel good while he was preaching so I don't believe he was of God you might be turning down the very one that God was using right I thought as children of God that the things that were supposed to be done was for children to grow up that we be not tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine see that's the point that will come down til somebody will stand one day and they'll say I and my father are one is that your words of the Prophet well who do you think you are well who do you think you are that's no problem see God is going to vindicate his bride I've always believed that I've always looked forward to it maybe not the way everybody else is believing it's going to take pleasure no but I've always looked for God to move on the scene and he's never failed me yet to move on the scene when I asked him so you can do what you want to or think what you want but you know yourself you can't come up to me and say you fathered this doctor and you went after that you went after this you went after that none of them doctor has ever affected me and I studied them to see what they were to find out what they were because you don't want to turn something down you might be turning down the very word of God so you better check it huh what you see then what are you doing what brother day I'm looking for a group of people to stand on this earth that will say I and my father are one and brother run said in these other things you know oh that's that's bringing forth the truth of the word of God and to declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and not walk away because that we get caught by some little doctrine or idea you know but to come to the place to really understand the full plan of redemption to where it would come forth then we could look at the Bible and to see this sad to see Peter saying one thing but run said Paul did say something different Paul's teaching the same thing that Peter was teaching Peter's teaching the same things James was teaching all of the adoption is the statue of a perfect man bring it on back to the simple one of what the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness meekness long-suffering the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness meekness right they've read all of the scriptures but come back to the basis of the message to her they would look in Ephesians where it tells us to grow up in here to him and who is he the word visions for that we make grows our by Peter says what the revealed word to grow to where you won't be deceived by all of these doctrines yes but I I enjoy the move of God amen well what if you've got to move on God without God being in it me then what have you got see the whole entire Bible is based upon one thing and that is truly whether or not God is real right see then if God is real he'll make itself manifest well all right if he's not then he won't but listen then this is lifestyle we talk about the adding of the virtues and things to the individual all right and we believe in that so we'll get into that next as we cover what virtue is and knowledge and temperance and thing and move on in the word but the main thing I want to end it with is one thought God lives in a trying being he himself is a crown being right body spirit soul God is real he's a triune being now to do that as a triune being to understand it then he had to come in human flesh alright so then the soul of the Lord Jesus was Almighty God right the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Almighty God God build a body the word he could come and live in that body all right that would make his whole being then too we were that we were trying to bring out the other day what Nana the Lord Jesus his body was not eternal it had to be made eternal in the resurrection you know in the change and the thing and going forward all right so that made him body spirit and soul a triune being to where everything is in the right place okay come on now that his body was not eternal because it was created it had a beginning so it had to be made eternal so he done that and is like Wade was preaching back months and months ago that he inherited eternal life see by following the word and letting all of that growing in him because the Bible speaks of said he grew in grace and knowledge huh and it came to a place till he brought that body totally under subjection all right all he had to do is move a finger and when I entered the whole thing at Calvary but he didn't he brought it all under subjection he yielded himself so much until he just become a complete unit of Almighty God when we get to glory it's not going to be a halo over here a pillar fire over here and there's something over here to represent these line you're gonna see Jesus and know who he is why because he's always been Jesus that's always been his name you don't thank him for that I walk through the house and lord thank you for revealing your name to me your name is Jesus now that's the name of the son mmm he said I come in my father tonight we don't get into those simplicity's do we didn't grow up so far till we don't get back into those topics the Jesus would say I and my father are one he said if you've seen me you've seen the father have we forgotten those scriptures there was God in a human vessel walk through life paid the price then and by paying the price for you and I to receive now listen we're enrollments there the other day where were heirs of God is up Paul and Roman and joint heirs with Jesus Christ right heirs of God is eternal life for our soul and our spirit listen eternal life for our soul and spirit comes from God eternal out in flesh making us co-equal with him is because he's going to change these bodies and make these bodies just as eternal as the soul and spirit will be towards our trouble at our trouble is in that spirit realm right it's in that spirit realm because within the soul of a born-again believer God is sealed in and Satan is sealed out and as a baby what it has to do is eat and it grows a Christian all you got to do is eat the Word of God and you'll grow right because that's part of the doing why because he's adding the word then listening how much do I try to teach you how much we've been over and over this messenger of Malachi 4:2 to 17:30 gonna do two things 1 turn the hearts of the face back revived and the thunders which is revelation containing the seven seals many times we've been over there it takes the opening of the word to bring the bride of Jesus Christ to a place that we can even talk about a change we're going to have to have control of that second room the spirit room before you come to the center I mean come to the change of the outside man right and see the nurse were that the stature of a perfect man comes in there of his divine nature coming into each one of us and what have I always talked he he adds the word this is all I've ever told you take the word you study the word you believe it you listen the tapes you do as much as you can and you're believing it all right and you're taking that word in come on a lot of times you read and don't even get a thing right how many times you said that that I read read read didn't get nothing and then all at once you pick up that same scripture same book or whatever you read it in other ways this opens everything up well how did that happen because he doesn't put the seed in the field you've been doing what was right see if we let him come in to us to give us a new birth then by that part of us inside now these this is the virtues the virtuous is not in the body that's a display right that's a display what your body is is a display of what's within you which is where they're deceiving is that the body can display one looks whereas the real looks is on the other side that's where the problem with the body you can't trust that thing it's got to be changed right you just can't trust it it's gonna give us trouble all over life now I'm now quote brother branham did he say you will be a sticker until the change comes well I can't have it he said there's another one of them you know I can't help it he didn't say that he didn't say you can't help it he said we'd be a sticker that's just God's honest truth we're human beings and long as we're in this world and in his life we're gonna have trouble with this old guy out here so quit trying to get him born again right let's watch the new birth of the denomination there what go to church then go to church getting through this getting past I'm gonna do that you do that go to the real close Oh open it wonderful we are all good Christians dealing with the outside man right but listen how does this thing work upon us this Christian there's a whole unit God brings the word in as we've got to read it right come on come on are you with me we've got to read it we've got to study it you don't just open this up well you need a little cleaning no no no no that's where our trouble is our trouble is we don't study the word well I read a book three months ago well that's real good I read John 3:16 I think he's still in the Bible you know okay sure listen God brings the word to us the Holy Ghost brother branham said now are you listening he said the Holy Ghost is in your soul your inner being whatever you want to call it spirit or soul or though you know the doctor or whatever the inner being of mankind the Holy Spirit comes within that inner being all right and brings within that now listen with that Holy Spirit have any other nature than the nature of God okay now you listening give me a few minutes so then that new birth brings within you and that's what Paul and Peter then we'll say the divine nature of Almighty coffee brother branham say it he said he had that and listen talk about not him Jesus Christ and he said they had a pice for that to go out you remember that he's in stature perfect man said he had within him and the disciples had within them the nature of God in their soul and a pice a way for that to go out because that's the life you live he said that's where the trouble is he said we come here and do things all wrong and everything at all during the week and then we come to church he said people sees that but now listen he brings the word we accept the word and say thank you lord he quickens it to us but I said the Holy Ghost in waiting on you to bring him the word well he is the word what do you mean why don't we know numb right now where the X word yeah well that's good on it so just close your Bible up throw it away he wants me know anything I've had this toad my face you try to tell people the truth and they'll say brother branham's head if God wants you to know he thanks and he you put somebody on the pulpit I had that toad in my face so many times until finally I answered a person I said yeah but if you're in the wrong building okay I got it all I hate that for a long time I said if you're in the wrong building then we're yeah I can't feed you in the wrong building so you're demanded to go for the words out I didn't say he wants you to he either demands it or either you don't do it you go with a word is that to stay with that word until it can manifest itself right why because he inside of you the Holy Ghost he has all these natures the Holy Ghost in you has all these natures right I mean you know we're said nature I mean virtue sometimes all right he has all of that but how is he going to get it back out he reveals the word you take the word and as you take the word then back out through your spirit now here's where we're gonna get it for a minute back out through your spirit he manifests these virtues back out through your spirit from that inward being now so it's not now the new birth of the body no it's not the new birth of the Spirit no hmm neither one of them won't work it's the new birth of the soul all right then that comes back outwardly that we're that natural body out here that's worth nothing the body's dead it worth nothing but through that God can bring his nature his ways back out through your spirit he'll use your spirit to make those manifest but it's not to just say well the spirit rent no it's the whole being sitting there thinking another day and the Lord just said the whole being the whole being is what we want to have in manifestation before God so if God brings us the word then how did that come into the spirit realm God's Word the body will automatically obey now listen I thought you believed in the body's dead no my body's not gonna automatically obey come on if your soul is right and it works back out through your spirit what's the body gonna do well I body to do what it wants to we ain't dumb the body does what the spirit says do right the body does what the spirit says do the spirit does what the soul says do so the whole being is a Christian these virtues will be made manifest out through your spirit after they're sealed in in God after they're sealed in God seals that word into you from the inside out let's don't worry about the body it'll take care of itself it's only gonna do what our soul says through our spirit to manifest through our body your body can't do it it would be some kind of a freak thing you said well I move I move yeah that's the way you'd be as a as you'd be calling yourself a Christian your your body keeps on but you know that something causes that old kicker to kill thicken right because if it it ain't it ain't something inside of our book that we need to be there's a spirit of that human being of course in the dogs is in everything else it's making that life work are you following me see then the the virtues will be made manifest through your spirit from the inner man which is the soul and listen folks a man back there that had his buddy killed that all kind of things went wrong adult reason never worked but yet he says my soul thirst after the old Lord that wouldn't in his body there wasn't any spirit it was any soul he was a human being you'd have one thing right if you'd listened I've tried to explain it for 40 years your soul is a moral obligation to do right now you explain it any other way you want to but your soul is really a moral obligation to do right why because you were created of God see we want these things manifest let them be manifest out through us but let it be because the word has done it to you not because you just decided to do it you decide to do it you're gonna mess up the next day come on but let God come from the inside and let him work on the whole big that's a whole being body spirit and soul Paul said to stand blameless before God how can that happen through the Christian life of Christ coming into the soul and then letting the soul work back out through your spirit realm into your body and it'll manifest it what brother Dale I have so many problems with my body obeying these other things that's right because it's in the spirit realm that's where you're dealing with that guy from he don't work by yourself your body don't work by yourself you said well Lord forgive me now forgive me that's old bodies acting wrong Lord it's closer than that so body ain't acting wrong body just does what something else with my vote motivates it controls it which is the spirit realm all right that's where I've always tried to explain it to you what a Christian can sin is what the Bible says and what the prophecy of Christian can sin but it's only through his spirit that he can see us he came sin with his body because it doesn't work unless his spirit works and he's not going to sin through the soul because that's sealed all right now as each one of these we'll get to this as each one of these come forth into human body I mean the human person the whole being is sealed in that's why I said to you don't they no need a word about trying to get brotherly kindness when you down to bottom that's all right but you ain't gonna do it until it's sealed in you got to let each thing be sealed in and then we'll come to brotherly kindness brother I said it was no hard problem for brotherly kindness it's in the book he said but now to hold keep it as a whole to keep it as a whole there's a hard problem but you understand what I'm getting at see through that part that's inside of you God keeps bringing that word through and it comes through now listen what's how it come just think the whole being or you know it's got to come through the body it's got to come through here so it's wonderful what about that man being able to be brought under control from the outside going in and then let that inside come back out so then really the world I'm going to interstate them really then the world is looking more at your spirit being displayed than it is anything else because your body's not displaying the body just working from what it did these artists were your memory your reason your conscience things come in at there's were II failed in her memory now she couldn't remember something being wrong by car cause it wasn't nothing wrong back I repeat come on listen and get it straight her memory her reason her conscious as I begin to reason on these time she had eternal life in her soul blasphemous names you go do what you want to what's your profit covers bless me miss tonight that Adam had eternal life well if Adam had eternal life that Eve had eternal life because it was in the same theophany now I'm quoting brother Branham okay and see then that comes under the be that there she was in her spirit room don't you think you can never conquer this spirit it's the easier to conquer the body than it is to conquer this spirit the only way you're ever gonna conquer the spirit that's within you is from the inside out you can fast that order go to show you where the prophet see it he said I've never and I know I used to people didn't like it but I I can't help it I found where the Prophet said he said I ain't never fasted over three days and my life misty everybody's oh brother run faster brother in fact he said ain't never faster over three days I'm alive now but he said he fasted constantly because a lot of times he didn't need but one meal a day that was fast for meetings he was having in time he would do and not eat you've heard him telling and how amazing it would be we've listened one the other day where he was talking about and he said said I went over to get something to eat he said cause I wouldn't go to do what would he wasn't gonna do the healing line that night or something he said so I could eat because gonna preach you know but he knew the difference and the way things work within him and he'd say I fasted today a lot of people fast brother Carolina he told us years ago remember he said I eat one meal a day he said I've been doing that for many many year did you only take one meal a day and I believe it I did I believe that he he'd done that yeah but see we put this on the emphasis of this letter they understood to put it on the corner brother instead of putting it on the word what do you mean he'd never fasted with her I'm not saying that you don't need to fast maybe we need a forty day one but I'll quote right around them they ain't no such thing in the Bible all right you know some of those people fasted and fasted we're rid of what they doing I'm not there with no stones a lot of them just got bigger pants you know instead of losing weight they've got bigger pants that can look like you're fasting right because if you fasten your each book let nobody know it other than your wife you know right then you go up and you say well no I can't eat today I'm fasting you're trying to be a Pharisee you won't never bite in the building I used to get so sick of that you remember the old days and you went in a a fake and you'd go in and you know you had sections and you walk in and then you know you'd say Oh non-smoking here two companies and more bless big preachers walking I warned on smoke inside yeah let stand what are we doing what are we trying to do what we got brother go ahead everybody having red yellow there's open number wait this afternoon in the industry but just keep these things in your mind trying to find God's Way well he fled they come from the east and they come from the lands afar to feast with the king who died nationís guests how blessed these pilgrims are by a bleak beholding his hallo baby oh love I love his grace and gems in this bamboo shine since Jesus has set me free I'm happy as hard you see my body trying to do nurse heal that inside man [Music] go get some you see then we can totally be birthed into the Word of God [Applause] [Music] no new birth in your body spirit Jesus until this outside man will follow that inside with the ransom stain don't ditch me [Music] [Applause]
