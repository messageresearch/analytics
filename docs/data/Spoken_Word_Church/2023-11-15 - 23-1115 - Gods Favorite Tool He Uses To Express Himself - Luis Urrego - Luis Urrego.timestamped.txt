[9:43] uses to express himself amen and uh God
[9:47] has tools amen even Satan is a tool in
[9:51] his
[9:52] hand remember that and there is this
[9:55] particular thing that God loves to use
[9:58] in order to Express himself that we're
[10:00] going to read here in 2 Corinthians

[10:06] heads before we read our heavenly father

[10:17] insufficient within ourselves Lord we
[10:19] we're not even worthy Lord God to even

[10:26] blood Lord Jesus Through the Redemptive
[10:29] process heavenly father of of the your

[11:29] hands now and this service into your
[11:31] hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen 2
[11:34] Corinthians 12:7
[11:37] says unless I should be exalted this is
[11:40] Paul speaking unless I should be exalted
[11:42] above measure through the abundance of
[11:45] the
[11:46] revelations there was given me to me a
[11:49] thorn in the flesh amen Paul's speaking
[11:52] here and saying that unless I get I get
[11:56] I get exalted by the things that that
[11:59] God has revealed to me God gave me a
[12:01] little prod gave me a little something a
[12:03] little Thorn to keep me
[12:05] humble and we thank God for that cuz if
[12:09] Paul needed it we certainly needed it
[12:12] amen to keep keep us keep us humble keep
[12:15] us under his his control and there was
[12:18] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[12:20] messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I
[12:23] should be exalted above measure for this
[12:26] thing I besought the Lord Thrice
[12:29] that it might depart from me so he asked
[12:31] the Lord three times for that to be
[12:34] taken away from him and he said unto me
[12:37] the Lord said unto me my grace is
[12:40] sufficient for thee in other words my
[12:42] grace is enough for you for my strength
[12:46] is made perfect in weakness amen my
[12:50] strength is made perfect in weakness
[12:53] most gladly therefore will I rather
[12:57] glory in my infirmity ities that the
[13:00] power of Christ May rest upon me so
[13:03] here's Paul speaking and bringing out
[13:05] his problem and then after God tells him
[13:09] uh my grace is sufficient so don't worry
[13:12] Paul just keep moving on then Paul
[13:15] changes his mindset and says most gladly
[13:18] therefore will I rather glory in my
[13:22] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[13:26] rest upon me amen what a strange thing
[13:29] to say Amen to glory in the things that
[13:33] you are going through I mean not not
[13:35] just infirmities like sicknesses but
[13:37] even the problems that we have domestic
[13:40] problems Financial issues amen God will
[13:43] not give us more than what we can handle
[13:46] that's that's a promise in the word so
[13:48] we rather we we better we better just
[13:51] just might as well just glory in
[13:53] them because in glory in them amen you
[13:56] bring you bring those around around you
[13:59] and say wow that person can praise the
[14:02] Lord even in the situation that they're
[14:04] in and it might give them strength amen
[14:07] praise the Lord Jesus you may be seated
[14:09] this
[14:09] afternoon
[14:12] amen
[14:13] so and so and it it said then he said
[14:17] unto me my grace is sufficient to thee
[14:18] for my strength is made perfect in in
[14:21] weakness amen and that right there is
[14:25] the tool that God likes to use just
[14:28] started off right right there amen God
[14:30] loves to use the tool of weakness in
[14:32] order to express himself amen praise God
[14:36] I remember one time in the scriptures
[14:38] where where uh uh the Bible says that
[14:41] that he has placed God has placed his
[14:45] treasure in Earth and vessels amen what
[14:48] are those Earth and vessels that's you
[14:50] and Meen amen that that is that you and
[14:53] me as
[14:55] weaklings amen because we have no power
[14:58] within our ourselves we have no strength
[15:00] within ourselves we come to this world
[15:02] Amen as babies not having dependent upon
[15:06] Upon A a mother upon someone to take
[15:09] care of us amen and if it wasn't for God
[15:12] Amen even from the time that we came out
[15:14] of the womb amen where would we be in
[15:16] this day where would we be in the hour
[15:18] that we're living in amen if it wasn't
[15:20] for God Amen for us to for us to be hoty
[15:24] and and and and and and and proud and
[15:27] and and and some even blaspheme
[15:30] God not knowing that it's God that's
[15:33] making even the the heart that's beating
[15:36] inside their chest it's Goden and God
[15:40] could stop that right there at any
[15:42] moment amen and it would be it would be
[15:45] there would be nothing amen but God
[15:48] pleased it pleased God to put his word
[15:52] or his treasures in a bride in this hour
[15:57] Amen in Earth and vessels that you and
[15:59] you now you we walk around the world in
[16:01] the day that we're living and nobody's
[16:03] going to think that you are the bride of
[16:07] Christ that's the bride of Christ she
[16:10] looks like that he looks like
[16:12] that they would not think oh yeah
[16:16] they'll say you're a Christian but they
[16:18] don't understand the power that dwells
[16:19] in a born again Christian amen that's
[16:22] part of the body of Christ amen the
[16:24] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is
[16:27] powerful and she does does have to show
[16:29] it but the works amen of God Amen will
[16:33] be expressed through her because why the
[16:35] Bible say brother brandom said that the
[16:37] voice is in the bride now amen we're not
[16:41] replacing the the we're not replacing
[16:43] God no we just speak as God speaks amen
[16:47] praise God so we speak amen because the
[16:50] word of God says it and we're not we're
[16:53] we're not replacing God Amen there's no
[16:55] other like Jesus Christ but the voice is
[16:58] in the bride now amen now I didn't say
[17:00] that brother brandham said that so
[17:02] you're can argue with
[17:04] him praise God we believe that he was a
[17:06] prophet right amen praise the Lord
[17:10] now real quickly brother brandom talks
[17:13] about this in in the uh in Christ The
[17:16] Mystery of God revealed and he talks
[17:18] about the three ways that God wanted to
[17:20] express himself amen and and and and and
[17:24] and the three-fold purpose that he had
[17:26] amen and and one of the ways is the is
[17:30] first is uh to express his completely
[17:34] through Christ amen and we know that he
[17:37] came and he was born and and took up the
[17:40] the the human our human ways and and
[17:42] became a man and to suffer and to to
[17:45] work and to sweat and and to do
[17:49] everything like we so that he could de
[17:53] so so that he could show amen and
[17:56] understand what you and I go through
[17:57] amen
[17:59] and so that he could become our Kinsman
[18:01] amen so that he could uh properly redeem
[18:05] us amen cuz there was no other way for
[18:07] us to be redeemed if we didn't have a
[18:09] Kinsman just like us to redeem us amen
[18:12] and brother Brandon says that God who
[18:14] who was a spirit and and and and and and
[18:17] and took up all space and time and and
[18:20] there was no way for him to redeem us
[18:22] unless he expressed himself in human
[18:25] form amen and he did that through our
[18:28] Lord Jesus Christ and we're just
[18:30] thankful for that amen praise God but he
[18:32] not only wanted to just leave it at
[18:35] Christ because many people sometimes
[18:37] they just put it and leave it just all
[18:39] on Christ but what he put in Christ amen
[18:43] God has also poured into into his church
[18:46] amen praise God and second that he
[18:51] wanted to have the preeminence in his
[18:54] church which is his body amen the bride
[18:58] in in this hour amen do you believe that
[19:00] praise God do you believe that you're a
[19:02] part of that body
[19:04] amen he says here till he could have the
[19:08] preeminence to express himself through
[19:11] them amen praise God and that's what God
[19:14] wants in this hour amen he he just
[19:16] doesn't want to just give a Bible and
[19:19] and and and and and that's it uh we
[19:22] could all just read the Bible and that's
[19:24] it amen but he he wants a living word in
[19:27] this hour amen he he wants you to live
[19:29] the Bible praise God and and so many
[19:32] people can read the Bible but not many
[19:34] people can live it right and that's what
[19:37] the bride of Christ is here to do Amen
[19:38] to express him Amen to express the
[19:42] expressed God praise the Lord and
[19:45] thirdly he wanted to restore this is his
[19:48] this third uh uh uh manifold uh um that
[19:53] the way he wanted to express himself
[19:54] third to restore the kingdom to its
[19:57] rightly position
[19:59] that fell by sin by the first Adam amen
[20:02] so those are three things that God the
[20:05] way he wanted to express himself amen
[20:07] through Christ through
[20:10] you and also through this his kingdom
[20:13] amen he's going to express himself amen
[20:16] through this thing is coming back to an
[20:18] Eden Eden Eden form amen praise God now
[20:22] we we know amen that we are not going to
[20:25] be able to rule this Kingdom unless the
[20:27] kingdom of God first is ruling in US
[20:30] amen and what is the kingdom of God it
[20:32] is the holy spirit praise the Lord amen
[20:35] when we don't know how to rule our own
[20:37] kingdom we won't be able to rule and
[20:38] Reign properly there amen so God is
[20:42] going to restore and God is restoring
[20:45] amen but it has to be it has to start
[20:48] with you amen inside inside out praise
[20:51] the Lord sometimes we try to do it from
[20:54] the outside in and it doesn't
[20:56] work it's it's like brother bandam said
[20:59] you're just putting peacock feathers on
[21:01] a buzzard carcass amen you're just
[21:04] trying to look good but in reality you
[21:07] have you don't have the goods amen and
[21:10] we don't want to be that way in this
[21:11] hour we want to know that we know that
[21:13] we know that we're born again praise God
[21:15] that we are filled with the Holy Ghost
[21:17] and that God Amen is ready has a willing
[21:20] vessel you are a willing vessel that he
[21:22] could express himself through in this
[21:24] hour amen praise the Lord brother random
[21:28] continues to say here in the mystery of
[21:30] Christ revealed but he had to let put
[21:33] man on free moral agency to fall he had
[21:37] to do it so that he might be a
[21:41] savior amen that's right to display
[21:45] what's in him see his attribute of
[21:49] Savior something had to be lost and you
[21:51] know uh for me this was uh this quote
[21:56] and then actually this message was
[21:58] what opened my eyes when I first came
[22:00] into the message it was the first
[22:02] message that I actually read um and God
[22:06] does things in such peculiar ways but
[22:09] yet they're his perfect ways oh amen
[22:13] because as some of you all have heard my
[22:15] testimony I have always I before that
[22:18] time that was in 1999 I had always asked
[22:21] and wrestled in my mind I was a
[22:24] Christian of course you know I went
[22:26] through my rebellious period period you
[22:28] know and and and I I when I did things
[22:30] of the world but but I wanted to come
[22:32] back at the age of 19 started serving
[22:35] the lord but I always asked myself I
[22:37] said Lord why is it that if you know the
[22:41] beginning from the end if you are
[22:44] Eternal all knowing then why did you
[22:47] create Adam and Eve and you knowing that
[22:49] they were going to
[22:51] fall seems like a legitimate question
[22:54] right amen and God there in Columbia
[22:59] 1999 not Columbia South Carolina but
[23:02] Columbia South America I we a cousin of
[23:06] my mom's had learned about the message
[23:08] he gave us some message books and out of
[23:11] all the 1100 messages this was the
[23:13] message that I picked up Christ The
[23:16] Mystery of God revealed it was in
[23:19] Spanish and as I was reading through
[23:22] that through that through that uh
[23:24] through that sermon I came across this
[23:27] and it exactly answered the question
[23:30] that I had always in my mind that I just
[23:32] talked about and I came running out of
[23:35] that room and I I was like was looking
[23:36] for my parents I was like Mom Dad look
[23:38] look what I just read look what I it
[23:40] struck me it did something to me amen
[23:43] amen because it revealed to me God's
[23:46] purpose and that I'm no accident and
[23:50] that you're not an accident amen and
[23:53] that God Amen had to allow sin to come
[23:58] had to allow for Adam to make the choice
[24:03] that he made in order for God to display
[24:07] his attributes because if there was
[24:09] nothing nothing to uh sick that he could
[24:12] not show that he was a Healer and if
[24:14] there was nothing that that that was
[24:16] that was lost he could not show that he
[24:18] was a savior and I was lost and I'm glad
[24:22] amen that he was able to with show that
[24:24] attribute amen so that he could save me
[24:27] amen amen and if he could save you too
[24:29] praise the Lord and I just thank God for
[24:32] that and that never struck me and then
[24:34] it just pil the revelations piled on
[24:36] after that praise the Lord for that amen
[24:40] praise God and you know what when
[24:41] something's a revelation Satan can't
[24:43] even take that away from me amen that's
[24:46] why I don't understand amen how can
[24:48] people leave this
[24:50] word I don't I I don't get it that's
[24:53] right something was not revealed exactly
[24:55] it was just head knowledge but when
[24:57] something is revealed amen the devil
[25:00] amen the demons out of hell amen cannot
[25:02] even take that away from you amen do you
[25:05] think that God could do you think Satan
[25:07] could take away from you uh one
[25:12] God once you know that there's only one
[25:14] God Amen and it's not a trinity that I
[25:16] believed uh throughout the seven Church
[25:20] ages of denominations that I went
[25:22] [Laughter]
[25:24] through you can't take that away from me
[25:27] now
[25:28] amen one God praise the Lord Jesus what
[25:31] a wonderful thing amen and brother
[25:34] Brandon continues to say here amen yes
[25:36] give the Lord Praise amen and the very
[25:39] thing that man fell and become lost he
[25:42] become the savior of
[25:45] that taking his own law and he could not
[25:48] do it as the great Jehovah that covered
[25:51] all space time see he couldn't do it and
[25:54] he had to become a man and he took
[25:57] kinship ship with the man that was lost
[25:59] amen and become a man God made flesh
[26:02] amen praise the Lord Jesus and if if if
[26:05] you I'm going through that sermon again
[26:07] Christ The Mystery of God revealed and
[26:10] uh I encourage you all to go through
[26:12] that it's a it's a powerful sermon amen
[26:15] praise the Lord Jesus now le let's talk
[26:17] about the word expression for just a
[26:19] moment and and and and this is what the
[26:21] dictionary says the word is it says the
[26:23] process of making known one's thoughts
[26:27] or feelings ings amen isn't that what
[26:30] God wanted to do amen God had thoughts
[26:33] from the beginning amen and it wasn't
[26:35] just he didn't want them just in in his
[26:37] head he didn't want it to just be head
[26:40] knowledge he wanted to express those
[26:42] thoughts amen and that's when that's
[26:45] what and that's when he spoke amen and
[26:48] things started coming into existence
[26:50] amen and that's what words are when you
[26:53] say something that is a thought
[26:57] expressed
[26:58] amen you have to think it first then say
[27:02] it that's the reason why sometimes
[27:06] somebody says something to you and they
[27:08] say well I was just kidding but wait a
[27:09] second you had to think that first
[27:12] before you actually said it I was just
[27:14] messing around brother I'm just joking
[27:16] I'm just joking no wait a second you
[27:18] have to think that
[27:20] first right before you say it now
[27:23] sometimes you know some people you do
[27:24] question that you know they just blurt
[27:26] things out and
[27:28] but but but that is exactly you have to
[27:31] think amen before you say something and
[27:34] so so it was so with God Amen he had
[27:38] thoughts amen he had you in his mind but
[27:40] it wasn't that wasn't enough he wanted
[27:42] to fellowship with you he wanted to to
[27:45] have communion with you amen he wanted
[27:48] to have amen a a relationship with you
[27:52] and you can't have a relationship amen
[27:55] with Just Thoughts amen right they have
[27:58] to be expressed they have to be in in in
[28:02] in word form and then come and be
[28:04] expressed amen physically praise the
[28:06] Lord because the word I believe the word
[28:09] is a continual Creator amen when God
[28:12] said let there be amen I believe that
[28:13] word is still going praise the Lord he's
[28:17] continuing to create amen that's
[28:19] something the devil hates because he
[28:21] can't do
[28:23] it amen God's word amen is eternal amen
[28:27] so what he said from the beginning amen
[28:29] continues all throughout eternity praise
[28:32] the Lord amen and it's a continual
[28:35] Creator amen hallelujah and and so the
[28:39] word expression means the process of
[28:40] making known one's thoughts or feelings
[28:44] the act of making your thoughts
[28:47] feelings Etc known by speech writing or
[28:52] some other method you know you we we
[28:54] take a look at for example the famous
[28:57] man in history who who expressed their
[29:00] own thoughts through through uh you take
[29:03] Shakespeare for example he expressed his
[29:06] thoughts through through dramas and
[29:08] through poetry and through writings and
[29:12] and and that was that was his strength
[29:16] in order to express what was in him
[29:18] right amen you take for example uh the
[29:22] famous scientist that Nicola Tesla now
[29:25] who's ever heard of Nicola Tesla amen he
[29:27] lived around the time of Einstein amen
[29:29] but Nicola Tesla amen he was a scientist
[29:32] and that was the way he expressed his
[29:35] his beliefs or the or his his theories
[29:38] or his things amen through his his tests
[29:41] and his experiments and and through
[29:43] science that was his strength right
[29:46] right you take actors today for example
[29:48] you take I don't know Will Smith or
[29:50] Denzel Washington or uh the or any of
[29:54] these actors today they express whatever
[29:58] role they're playing amen because that
[30:00] is their strength right that is what
[30:03] they were called to do I guess but God
[30:07] is not
[30:08] so God expresses his
[30:11] strength through
[30:14] weakness they express their strength
[30:16] amen they they express their thoughts
[30:19] through their strength God expresses his
[30:21] thoughts through weakness think about
[30:24] that amen amen that's what that's the
[30:27] tool that God likes to use and so we we
[30:31] are the weak ones amen we are weak amen
[30:36] we're nothing but sheep at least we
[30:39] should be that's right amen and when
[30:43] we're not amen following the shepherd
[30:45] the way we should be amen then we're
[30:46] just we're just goats
[30:48] then amen we're just acting like goat
[30:51] we're sheep acting like
[30:54] goats amen because sometimes we know
[30:56] better
[30:58] but yet we still want a butt and we
[31:01] still want to rebel and we still don't
[31:03] want to follow the shepherd amen so
[31:05] therefore he has to take his his his
[31:08] staff his crooked staff with the hook
[31:11] and bring us back into the fall and say
[31:13] get back in here you're one of mine I'm
[31:16] not losing not one amen get back in the
[31:20] fold amen and quit your cutting
[31:22] up and I'm thankful for that rod and
[31:25] that staff praise the Lord Jesus
[31:27] amen that brings us in order amen and he
[31:31] does it
[31:32] lovingly amen he doesn't bang and pow
[31:35] and then brings them brings them amen he
[31:37] does it
[31:38] lovingly right he does come on maybe a
[31:41] little jerk that they feel it and they
[31:43] know that he means business but that's
[31:46] what that staff is there for that's what
[31:47] David said amen we'll read it here in
[31:49] just a moment David said thy rod and thy
[31:51] staff they they guide me in Psalms
[31:54] chapter 23 praise the Lord now there is
[31:56] a different difference between a rod and
[31:58] a staff we're going to look at that here
[32:00] in just a moment praise God but God he
[32:03] expresses his mind through weaknesses
[32:06] the world these these artists and these
[32:09] people amen they express their mind
[32:11] through their strengths God expresses
[32:14] his mind through
[32:16] weaknesses through
[32:18] disappointments so that the world may
[32:21] think we are but that's what God likes
[32:24] to use amen amen God likes to use
[32:27] something that looks like it's is is is
[32:29] is is almost at the verge of of of of
[32:33] dying or at The Verge amen and that's
[32:35] where God likes to work best amen the
[32:38] weakest Christian on their knees puts
[32:41] the devil Amen to to on the run right
[32:44] amen the weakest Christian how much how
[32:47] much then a strong Christian can do come
[32:50] on Amen if a weak Christian can do that
[32:52] how much more a strong Christian amen
[32:55] praise God
[32:57] hallelujah amen so Paul said it here in
[33:00] 2 Corinthians 12:9 we just read it he
[33:02] said he said here and he said unto me my
[33:06] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[33:08] strength is made perfect in weakness
[33:12] most gladly therefore will I rather
[33:14] glory in my infirmities that the power
[33:17] of Christ May rest upon me it's so
[33:20] awesome Amen to think it's striking that
[33:23] that that he says my strength is made
[33:27] perfect in weakness that wasn't Paul
[33:29] saying that that was God telling Paul
[33:32] that my strength is made perfect through
[33:36] weak situations through weak weak bodies
[33:40] through weak areas in your life amen God
[33:44] can show his strength through that amen
[33:47] amen and sometimes you know we go
[33:49] through life and we wonder why Lord this
[33:51] has you why can't this be taken away
[33:54] from me right right now and then I I I
[33:57] keep wrestling with this you know I love
[33:58] you Lord I I but I just can't get away
[34:01] from this I I'm struggling I'm fighting
[34:03] amen and God says just keep leaning on
[34:06] my word I'm going to use that to make
[34:08] you a better
[34:11] Christian amen yes sir no matter what it
[34:13] is in your life exactly God uses the
[34:17] weakest things amen the weakest area in
[34:19] your life to make you stronger praise
[34:23] the Lord Jesus amen now let's look at
[34:27] Moses's Rod here for just a moment how
[34:29] many want to do that amen praise the
[34:33] Lord I want us to turn to Exodus chapter
[34:36] 4 Exodus chapter 4 we're going to read
[34:40] verses
[34:41] 1-5 uh and then a few more verses but if
[34:45] we look at Moses's Rod amen Moses's Rod
[34:48] represented Moses's
[34:51] weakness because you think about this
[34:54] now Moses had um had left Egypt because
[35:00] he somebody saw him killing an Egyptian
[35:03] because he was trying to defend one of
[35:05] his
[35:06] countrymen right so he thought he was
[35:10] doing a good deed but he ended up in his
[35:12] own good deed thinking that he was doing
[35:15] something good he ended up doing amen
[35:18] something that he wasn't supposed to do
[35:20] he says well surely this thing is found
[35:22] out and people know about this so he
[35:24] takes off and he runs to median he he
[35:26] gets married married and and and he
[35:28] becomes a shepherd and he thinks that in
[35:31] his life that that is what that's all
[35:34] he's going to do amen he created his own
[35:37] plan this is what I'm doing
[35:41] he you know forget it I you know I can't
[35:45] go back to Egypt sure I had I had good
[35:48] times there at at that church and and in
[35:51] those days we would you know that was
[35:53] that was good that was wonderful amen
[35:55] but I just can't go back I I I've got to
[35:57] continue I got to continue living yeah I
[36:00] got to raise a family and and and I've
[36:02] just this is what I choose right and so
[36:05] it was all about him then it was I I I
[36:09] me me me and that's what we do sometimes
[36:12] amen we put God out of out of the the
[36:14] the picture and we just say I I I me me
[36:17] me and and and and uh we want to live to
[36:20] an island to ourselves and and and just
[36:23] move on with our life and that's what
[36:26] Moses thought that he was able to that
[36:29] he was going to be able to do right but
[36:31] God Amen wasn't going to allow that God
[36:35] had a purpose for Moses amen so we see
[36:38] here in MO in Exodus chapter 3 God
[36:41] Appears to Moses in a burning bush he
[36:42] speaks to him and then here in chapter 4
[36:45] Moses uh replies and he says and Moses
[36:49] answered and
[36:50] said but behold now here he he became a
[36:55] goat
[36:58] all the 40 years that he was away not
[37:01] doing what he was called to do and he
[37:04] ended up becoming a goat instead of a
[37:07] sheep so what God does he's preparing
[37:10] well we'll just read it and Moses
[37:12] answered and said but behold they will
[37:15] not believe
[37:16] me you see that's what happens amen when
[37:19] we when we stay away from the will of
[37:22] God the will of God is for you to come
[37:24] to church the will of God for you to be
[37:26] in his word amen amen we become
[37:29] goats but but but you know behold they
[37:33] will not believe me nor hearken unto my
[37:36] voice for they will say the Lord hath
[37:39] not appeared unto thee and the Lord said
[37:42] unto him what is that in thine hand it's
[37:46] not that God didn't know what it was in
[37:48] his hand but he wanted Moses to tell him
[37:51] what was in his hand what do you have in
[37:53] your hand Moses and he said a rod
[37:57] now I said earlier that a rod and a
[38:01] staff are two different tools that
[38:04] Shepherds use uh they use both of them
[38:07] interchangeably and it's not the same
[38:09] thing and I know sometimes we look and
[38:12] we see sometimes that he one them the
[38:14] the Crooked one is actually the staff
[38:17] the rod is actually a smaller stick that
[38:21] that is used to protect the Sheep to
[38:26] protect them against animals he also the
[38:29] the shepherd also uses it as a walking
[38:31] stick but it was it was almost like a
[38:34] club and he was able to wield that thing
[38:37] much easier it w and he would also use
[38:41] that that that Rod to uh to count the
[38:44] Sheep as well and it makes me think am
[38:47] man about Jesus Christ how he gave that
[38:50] that Parable amen about the the the the
[38:53] Lost Sheep amen he lost he lost Lo 99
[38:57] were found you know 99 were not lost
[38:59] amen but that one was was was lost amen
[39:02] how did he know how many he had well it
[39:05] was a rod that they used to use amen and
[39:08] with that Rod he would count the
[39:09] shepherd counts the Sheep amen and he
[39:12] he's not banging them upside the head
[39:14] he's just kind of you know prodding them
[39:16] and and and and he counts the sheep and
[39:18] to let him know how many sheep because
[39:20] he knows how many sheep he's supposed to
[39:22] have amen he knows amen he's not going
[39:24] to lose not one this day in the in the
[39:26] hour that we're living in Saints he's
[39:28] not going to lose not one amen he knows
[39:30] amen who he predestinated to to be
[39:34] conformed to His Image amen they will
[39:36] come amen you came you aren't going to
[39:39] be lost amen someway somehow he'll go
[39:42] out and find you amen praise God even if
[39:44] he has to pick you up and put you on his
[39:47] shoulders break your leg amen and put
[39:49] you on his shoulders but he's going to
[39:51] mend you afterwards amen whatever he has
[39:54] to do amen but he's he's going to bring
[39:56] him he's not going to lose not one but
[40:00] but this Rod amen is is is is used for
[40:03] protection amen and then the staff is
[40:05] used mainly for the Sheep amen to guide
[40:08] the Sheep to to uh to to lead them amen
[40:13] and
[40:14] so what Moses says here is that he says
[40:16] he has a rod so according to what he
[40:19] said look like he had the the the club
[40:22] is what he had amen and so and we know
[40:26] that a rod and a staff they're made out
[40:28] of wood and wood represents Humanity
[40:30] amen so here is this Ro rod and this in
[40:33] this staff that is made of wood it's
[40:36] it's weak it's not strong unless the
[40:38] human wields it and and uses it amen but
[40:41] it's nothing within itself yet God asks
[40:44] Moses what is that at thy RA in thy hand
[40:47] after Moses tries to give an
[40:50] excuse you don't want to be used by me
[40:52] all right I'm going to use a stick
[40:55] instead
[40:57] and he said now watch what the what the
[40:59] Lord said to to Moses and he and he said
[41:02] cast it on the ground and so Moses cast
[41:05] it on the ground and it became a
[41:09] serpent and then Moses fled from before
[41:13] it in other words he got scared and he
[41:15] ran right I think I would
[41:19] too snakes just looking at him amen make
[41:23] give you the the give you chills amen
[41:26] imagine amen the staff that you were
[41:28] holding in your hand amen and when you
[41:30] release and when he released it amen God
[41:32] could then use
[41:34] it amen it's when you let go of whatever
[41:37] you're you're let you you have a hold of
[41:39] Amen that God can actually use in your
[41:41] life amen and if you don't let go of
[41:43] that amen then God can't do anything
[41:46] about it but when you let it go amen God
[41:48] can take a hold of it amen and use it
[41:50] for for his glory am and to show you his
[41:53] power amen amen what if mooses Moes
[41:56] would have still held on to it God was
[41:59] not would not be able to to to change it
[42:01] into a into a stick into a serpent amen
[42:05] and he said cast it on the ground and he
[42:07] cast it on the ground and it became a
[42:09] serpent and the Lord said unto Moses put
[42:12] forth thine hand and take it by the
[42:17] tail pick it up
[42:19] Moses you just now saw it turn into a
[42:22] snake your stick turned into a snake now
[42:26] why don't you go ahead and pick it
[42:28] up imagine if you were
[42:32] Moses I don't know if if I I would I
[42:36] would I really need
[42:37] [Laughter]
[42:40] Revelation put forth thine hand and take
[42:43] it by the tail and he put forth his hand
[42:47] Moses put forth his hand and caught it
[42:50] and it became a rod in his hand amen
[42:54] right so it became a a rod again what it
[42:57] was originally meant to be amen it
[42:59] became a rod in his hand that they may
[43:02] believe that the Lord verse 5 that they
[43:04] may believe that the Lord God of their
[43:05] fathers the god of Abraham the god of
[43:07] Isaac and the god of Jacob hath appeared
[43:10] unto thee and then let's skip down to
[43:12] verse 10 and Moses said unto the Lord
[43:15] here's Moses again with his excuses oh
[43:17] my Lord after he had just seen what just
[43:19] happened I am not
[43:22] eloquent neither that here to for nor
[43:24] since thou has spoken un to thy servant
[43:27] but I am slow of speech and a slow
[43:31] tongue and the Lord said unto him who
[43:33] hath made man's mouth and or who maketh
[43:36] the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the
[43:39] blind have not I the
[43:42] Lord now therefore go and I will be with
[43:46] thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt
[43:49] say amen amen and he said oh my Lord
[43:53] send I pray thee by the hand him whom
[43:56] thou wil send just don't send
[43:59] me he's still bucking against
[44:03] God and the anger of the Lord was
[44:05] kindled against Moses so God got angry
[44:09] with Moses and he said is not Aaron the
[44:12] levite thy brother I know that he can
[44:14] speak well and also behold he cometh
[44:16] forth to meet thee and when he seeth
[44:18] thee he will be glad in his heart and
[44:20] thou shalt speak unto him and put words
[44:22] in his mouth and I will be with thy
[44:24] mouth and with his mouth and will teach
[44:26] teach you what ye shall do and he shall
[44:28] be thy spokesman unto the people and he
[44:30] shall be even he shall be to thee
[44:32] instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to
[44:35] him instead of God and watch verse 17
[44:37] and thou shalt take this rod in thy hand
[44:40] wherewith Thou shalt do signs amen all
[44:43] right now Verse 18 um let's just skip
[44:46] down to verse 19 uh Moses in verse 18
[44:49] ask his father-in-law let us let us go
[44:53] we I I believe what God said I'm going
[44:55] to take Egypt to take over because God
[44:57] said so I'm convinced and
[45:01] concerned amen and so verse 19 it says
[45:04] and the Lord said unto Moses and Midian
[45:06] go return into Egypt for all the men are
[45:09] dead which sought thy life and Moses
[45:12] took his wife and his sons and set them
[45:15] upon an ass and he returned to the land
[45:18] of Egypt and watch and Moses took the
[45:21] rod of God in his hand so now it's not
[45:26] the rod of Moses anymore now is the rod
[45:28] of God amen amen whatever you put into
[45:32] God's hand amen becomes God's amen if
[45:36] you leave it alone and let God use it
[45:38] amen it becomes his amen if you just
[45:41] yield it unto him amen God wanted to
[45:44] express himself through Moses amen
[45:47] through this rod and not necessarily
[45:49] through the rod but it showed that Moses
[45:52] obedience to God's word and that that
[45:55] Rod was the a symbol of Moses's
[45:57] obedience to his word amen and we we see
[46:00] that throughout the the the the plagues
[46:02] and throughout many times God would say
[46:05] you know uh let out the rod or or pull
[46:08] let it out and and and and then flies
[46:11] and things would come about you see amen
[46:13] so God wanted to express his wonders
[46:16] through that Avenue amen amen a a a
[46:20] simple
[46:23] Rod uh that represents human
[46:26] ity that's what God wanted to use amen
[46:29] and that's how God wants to use you you
[46:31] and me in this hour amen something
[46:34] simple something insignificant you might
[46:36] think but in reality you're worth more
[46:39] than 10,000 worlds your soul is that's

[47:11] obedience to God's word amen and it did
[47:14] powerful things amen it did powerful
[47:18] things when
[47:19] you give when Moses gave it over to God

[47:56] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[47:59] Waters amen he restoreth my soul he
[48:02] leadth me in the paths of righteousness

[48:39] amen the the the sh the Sheep the
[48:42] scattered sheep of Israel amen from
[48:44] their enemies from the Wolves of the the
[48:46] Egyptian wolves that's what God used

[49:30] amen we should be
[49:32] Saints we should be you know sometimes
[49:36] uh sometimes we we get
[49:38] discouraged and sometimes we we wonder

[50:02] God called you and from the beginning
[50:05] amen and how he's LED you even to the
[50:07] point where you are now
[50:09] amen and you're like you realize you

[53:46] the EMB betterment of the body amen it

[54:43] to feed 5,000 amen you know I like what
[54:47] what what what the the testimony that
[54:49] brother uh Vernon was telling about the
[54:51] little boy in the Philippines little
[54:54] first grader I don't know if y'all paid
[54:55] attention to that or not that little
[54:58] first grade boy I thought that was
[55:00] striking that all he did was just he was
[55:03] just going to school and he wasn't he
[55:06] wasn't telling people about brother
[55:08] brandom he wasn't telling people about
[55:10] about the message he wasn't telling
[55:12] people about Jesus he was just living
[55:15] out what his parents were living at
[55:18] home and what he was doing was he was he
[55:22] would pray for his meal and it was
[55:25] strange to his teacher and he his
[55:28] teacher looked at him and he said he
[55:29] said son who are your parents and he
[55:31] said M parents are such and such do they
[55:34] go to church yeah we go to church over
[55:36] here such and such and she said well and
[55:39] so she got a touch in touch with his
[55:41] parents and his parents gave him the
[55:43] gave her the address she went to church
[55:45] and and through that amen she got
[55:47] baptized and accepted the message that
[55:50] little boy didn't never tell her not one
[55:52] thing it was just only him praying for
[55:54] his lunch
[55:55] amen
[55:56] amen just little things like that that
[55:59] God uses Amen to save 10,000
[56:04] worlds amen that was 10,000 worlds right
[56:08] there amen what a powerful testimony how
[56:12] God does things so so peculiar and yet
[56:15] they're his perfect ways amen right so
[56:18] if we're weaklings and God uses us amen
[56:22] our weakness to Express himself we know
[56:27] that Satan amen he's weak because all
[56:30] power has been stripped away from him he
[56:33] has no power in this hour amen he's only
[56:36] a bluff when he talks to you he's only
[56:39] lying when he says you've got such and
[56:41] such a problem you've got cancer you've
[56:43] got diabetes you've got a problem with
[56:45] your heart you've got to have this this
[56:47] that or the other you're family this
[56:49] that or the other your children will
[56:51] never come to the Lord and this that or
[56:52] the other he remember all power has been
[56:55] stripped from him amen praise God and
[56:58] all he is being used is as a tool in
[57:01] God's hand in order to express himself
[57:04] in a mighty way and you watch and see
[57:06] how God's going to how's God's going to
[57:08] perform amen amen all he is is a
[57:11] weakling just like you were a weakling
[57:14] but now amen because you've been born
[57:16] again you have strength through him amen
[57:18] Satan can't be born again like you and
[57:20] me amen he's still weak so he belongs
[57:24] amen man the only thing he wants he can
[57:26] see is the bottom of our
[57:28] shoe that's the only thing that he's
[57:30] supposed to see amen he's supposed to be
[57:32] under your feet and he rises up amen
[57:35] around the little corner or between your
[57:37] toe there and he says you've got
[57:42] cancer you've got
[57:45] diabetes amen you've got this that in
[57:48] your other
[57:49] amen that's right that's where he's
[57:52] supposed to stay amen by your faith in
[57:56] his word right put it to action amen put
[58:01] that thing into action amen and God will
[58:04] take care of the rest because amen he's
[58:06] already a defeated weakling that's right
[58:09] Satan is nothing but a
[58:11] lie
[58:14] amen and he talks to you every
[58:17] day talks to me every day amen yeah
[58:21] three
[58:23] times talk talks to me every as soon as
[58:26] I get up in the morning he's already
[58:28] talking to
[58:29] me so you know what I got to stump
[58:33] him wait you you belong under my shoe
[58:36] just like the roach I killed in the
[58:37] bathroom the other night that's where
[58:40] you belong
[58:41] Satan that's how you got to do it yeah
[58:45] amen that's where he belongs because
[58:47] that's what Jesus did amen he didn't
[58:49] play with Satan right amen right he
[58:53] didn't play his games that's right amen
[58:55] but sometimes that's what we do we we
[58:57] play along and then that's where we get
[59:00] in trouble amen praise the Lord Jesus
[59:03] amen we could take also Gideon amen just
[59:06] real quick and we with this we'll Gideon
[59:08] amen he was a
[59:09] weakling if you read the story of Gideon
[59:12] and in in in in the Book of Judges amen
[59:15] uh uh to me I I I I I like I like that
[59:19] story cuz cuz uh Gideon was just doing
[59:23] what Moses was doing in the
[59:26] desert I'm just doing my own thing I'm
[59:29] living my own life I'm here you know uh
[59:31] doing my farming and and doing and and
[59:35] and and I ain't got time to deal with
[59:37] these enemies around
[59:39] me and the enemies around around him and
[59:42] the kingdom being being taken over and
[59:45] and and and and and here comes the angel
[59:47] of the Lord God
[59:50] himself appears to Gideon and he tells
[59:52] him he said thou mighty man of
[59:56] Valor right he's calling him something
[59:59] that he thinks that he is not Gideon
[1:00:02] didn't think himself that way but God
[1:00:05] did he said thou Mighty Man of Valor
[1:00:09] amen and then so Gideon says wait a
[1:00:12] second so Lord if it's you then if if
[1:00:16] it's you and and if you are real then
[1:00:19] why are all these things happening to us
[1:00:22] we're supposed to be prospering we're
[1:00:23] supposed to be your
[1:00:25] people and he has a discourse there with
[1:00:27] the angel and he says listen I'm going
[1:00:29] to use you Gideon I don't care what you
[1:00:32] think about yourself I have a plan for
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:36] amen and so Gideon had to realize amen
[1:00:39] that through his weakness amen he was
[1:00:41] able to conquer and be the judge that
[1:00:43] God called him to be amen and you can
[1:00:46] read there at the End Amen with but at
[1:00:48] the end amen he he destroys that I for I
[1:00:51] forgot I forgot the the the the city or
[1:00:53] the people that they were supposed to
[1:00:55] fight uh their name but 300 men that God
[1:00:59] used amen that Gideon LED Amen in order
[1:01:02] to defeat over 1500 men amen and all
[1:01:07] they had was just
[1:01:10] lanterns in their hands that's they had
[1:01:13] vessels with with candles in it and they
[1:01:17] were running down the mountain and Moos
[1:01:20] and and and Gideon told them shatter
[1:01:22] those things and and and be and through
[1:01:25] that it caused chaos in the camp of the
[1:01:27] enemy and they thought that it was
[1:01:29] thousands of them getting ready to rush
[1:01:31] them and it was only 300 of
[1:01:33] them right and it was only just Earth
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:38] vessels Earth and vessels made by
[1:01:42] man but when God is in the work when God
[1:01:45] is being you when the word of the Lord
[1:01:47] is being followed God can make it seem
[1:01:49] like amen it's a whole host of angels
[1:01:54] amen a whole host amen Satan can't do
[1:01:57] nothing against that amen that's right
[1:01:59] Satan is amen that's what we do when we
[1:02:01] take the word of God
[1:02:03] Amen take it by take it uh it promises
[1:02:07] amen Satan won't be able can't handle
[1:02:10] that he takes off
[1:02:13] running and that's where he needs to
[1:02:16] be Satan you just run right back under
[1:02:18] my my
[1:02:20] feet where you belong praise the Lord
[1:02:22] Jesus how many love the Lord
[1:02:25] amen amen all right so uh I left my
[1:02:30] phone in here I'm sorry excuse me I was
[1:02:32] going to connect
[1:02:36] it um as you all know we're getting

[1:03:14] uh we helped we helped uh with some
[1:03:17] money some funds to uh brother Robert um
[1:03:22] and his church there in Honduras
[1:03:26] make this big okay I don't know if y'all
[1:03:28] can see
[1:03:30] that okay there you go all right now
[1:03:33] brother Robert he's the pastor there and
[1:03:35] so in October they send me a video of
[1:03:37] the progress of of of how that's going
[1:03:40] what it was is they just needed to build
[1:03:42] upon the the the church they needed to
[1:03:45] have a a kitchen and they needed to make
[1:03:49] more bathrooms because um they're going
[1:03:51] to have a pastor's meeting or or a
[1:03:54] ministers meeting there in this coming
[1:03:57] year and they just wanted to be able to
[1:03:59] accommodate you know the the and of
[1:04:01] course they don't have the funds to to
[1:04:03] be able to do that work so we helped him
[1:04:06] out I believe it was $6,000 that that we
[1:04:08] helped him out with and so they they
[1:04:11] they they sent a video of kind of the
[1:04:13] progress that they were making and
[1:04:16] so this
[1:04:23] is
[1:04:26] so at the beginning right here
[1:04:33] um this is a sister brother Robert's
[1:04:36] wife um this area right
[1:04:40] here is uh going to be the the like the
[1:04:43] little kitchen
[1:04:44] area um and um where they're going to be
[1:04:49] able to cook many meals a lot of food
[1:04:53] for for a lot of VIs visitors that come
[1:04:55] and so that's that's the area that they
[1:04:59] needed and
[1:05:03] then that's the church at the end right
[1:05:05] there that's the that's the
[1:05:10] church and then there's brother
[1:05:23] Robert was provided by by by the church
[1:05:27] so right here is where they're going to
[1:05:29] have the little Pastor study right here
[1:05:32] where where they're taking down those
[1:05:33] columns that's where they're going to
[1:05:35] have that little study that they want
[1:05:37] they were wanting to have because the
[1:05:39] study has always been in the inside the
[1:05:41] pastor's house this is the pastor's
[1:05:43] house where they're at the front porch
[1:05:45] here and so they would I've preach there
[1:05:48] personally and so you go in there and
[1:05:51] that's where you come you come out of
[1:05:52] his house that's the study to go go to
[1:05:54] the pulpit to to to to preach so they
[1:05:57] wanted to have a little an actual Pastor
[1:06:00] study um and so that's what they're
[1:06:02] building right there um and so they told
[1:06:06] me that they were going to make more uh
[1:06:07] give me more updates on that and so I
[1:06:10] just wanted to share that with you
[1:06:13] all also um this wasn't something by the
[1:06:18] done by the church but it was uh
[1:06:20] provided by the funds um and at brother

[1:06:36] this and it was about
[1:06:38] $4,500 and this was a church that we
[1:06:41] were able to build and help build there
[1:06:43] in Honduras that they were needing and

[1:08:15] doctor's visit they those tests came out
[1:08:19] good he doesn't have issues with his
[1:08:21] actual eardrums and stuff it's just that
