[2:57] scripture turn where we've been reading
[2:58] Romans 8 amen and we'll go to Genesis
[3:02] 3:15 so we pray that the Lord would just
[3:06] continue on our thought and may we you
[3:10] know see him made manifest as the main
[3:13] thing
[3:14] right how does God predestinate yes he
[3:18] predestines by for knowledge amen CU he
[3:21] knew all the things that would take
[3:23] place and you knew what would happen in
[3:25] the garden so that's what we're reading
[3:27] about amen is to seeing what happen in
[3:30] the garden to relate down to where we
[3:31] are now and then we can can see the
[3:34] whole thing right amen father we thank
[3:37] you for your love and your grace unto us
[3:39] we thank you for Calvary thank you for
[3:41] being you Lord and revealing yourself
[3:43] unto us and thank you for not staying up
[3:46] in heaven when you created man and we
[3:48] fail but yet you come right down here to
[3:49] be with us and just fellowship with us
[3:52] even in our fallen estate you did not
[3:55] cast us away but now Lord we pray that
[3:58] you would just open our eyes to the the
[3:59] revelation of redemption that we may
[4:02] walk in the light of your grace we love
[4:04] you and we thank you be with each one of
[4:05] these that are sick we know the report
[4:07] there sister Monica's mother's not
[4:09] looking good but yet we still believe in
[4:12] a Healer who can take care of all things
[4:15] we love you and we thank you Father
[4:17] guide us now have your way in Jesus name
[4:20] amen okay Romans
[4:23] 8
[4:26] 28 and we know that all things work
[4:28] together for good to to them that love
[4:31] God to them who are the called according
[4:33] to his purpose for whom he did for know
[4:36] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[4:39] to the image of his son that he might be
[4:41] the first born among many Brethren now
[4:44] remember that Sunday the first born all
[4:47] right moreover whom he did predestinate
[4:51] them he also called and whom he called
[4:53] them he also Justified and them he
[4:56] justified whom he justified them he also
[4:58] glorified what shall we say to these
[5:01] things if God be for us who can be
[5:04] against us right let's run over in
[5:06] Genesis now and just read
[5:08] Genesis
[5:11] 3:15 very famili your scripture with
[5:14] us but yet learning a whole lot more
[5:16] about it am says and I will put enmity
[5:19] between thee and the woman and between
[5:24] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[5:28] thy head and thy shall bruise his heel
[5:31] you may be seated the Lord at his
[5:33] Blessing to the reading of the word
[5:36] now we have
[5:38] been covering for quite a bit on this
[5:43] and trying to get over a little bit
[5:46] tonight we still uh you know put a
[5:49] secondary title to the life two messages
[5:51] plus tonight we'll be talking about part
[5:54] three of the seed of the
[5:57] woman now I want you to think with
[6:02] me about the point that we're trying to
[6:06] bring that I'm not like brother forny
[6:09] now taking off doing I'm just sputter
[6:11] sputter and just clim climber and fall
[6:13] down and get up and walk on
[6:18] okay but see to me
[6:20] now to my understanding and I know it
[6:23] goes spiritual then it goes physical it
[6:25] goes in through every way but see
[6:28] there's only two
[6:31] seeds all
[6:33] right now everybody has to be included
[6:37] within that point of two seeds right
[6:41] okay now two seeds meaning what the seed
[6:46] of the serpent
[6:48] yep and the seed of the woman yep right
[6:51] all right now so then everything would
[6:54] fall as I said within that category of
[6:58] those two seeds that's right right all
[7:01] right and we know that it started with
[7:04] the point of the serpent trying to
[7:07] inject or did inject into uh Eve his
[7:13] unbelief which perverted the word right
[7:17] because there's really not two words
[7:19] there's only one word the other one is a
[7:21] perverted word so then you've got two
[7:25] seeds it's really not two seeds one
[7:26] right seed one perverted seed are people
[7:31] all right and
[7:33] see the serpent has no
[7:36] seed all right so then there was no way
[7:39] for him to be able to uh do anything so
[7:43] he had to use the Beast all right now
[7:47] but remember then we'll get to it in a
[7:49] minute about that seed of the beast
[7:52] that's why it doesn't call it the seed
[7:54] of the Beast right see if it said the
[7:56] seed of the Beast there would have been
[7:57] no mystery right right man would have
[7:59] been able to read the Bible and said
[8:01] with the seed of the
[8:03] beast but by being the fact of saying it
[8:06] was the most subtle of all the serpent
[8:08] was of the Beast all right then it put a
[8:11] mystery in the Bible am that's right
[8:14] that mystery is that there's only two
[8:16] seeds then right all right it's the seed
[8:21] of
[8:22] God the other is a perverted right seed
[8:26] right something that was done wrong
[8:30] right amen all right so now then even
[8:33] the Beast as I said it wouldn't be
[8:36] called the the seed of the Beast right
[8:39] it would be called the seed of The
[8:41] Serpent and then all the way through the
[8:43] Bible you could speak of the
[8:46] serpent but then remember the last part
[8:50] when you're coming into the Book of
[8:51] Revelations you're going back until it
[8:54] speaks of the Beast that rose up all
[8:58] right that's all right so it's a
[8:59] spiritual Point
[9:01] beginning but then it goes into
[9:03] something more than just a a a a a
[9:08] spiritual point there has to be an
[9:10] attribute like there drinking gambling
[9:12] smoking running around with women is not
[9:14] sin that's the attribute of it so then
[9:16] what happened in the garden physically
[9:18] was an attribute of that and that was
[9:22] the way the prophet said that Satan had
[9:24] of trying to enter the human race right
[9:29] he could not create right all right so
[9:34] then he wouldn't be able to do that but
[9:36] now remember he has no physical seed he
[9:40] is a we we showed the prophet said he is
[9:42] a spirit being he he you know he
[9:46] spiritual being he's he has no natural
[9:48] physical seed and he can't
[9:53] create right God could
[9:55] create but see the serpent couldn't
[9:58] create all he could do was just take the
[10:00] knowledge he had of the principles of
[10:03] life and to see that if he could get
[10:07] even that Beast together that God would
[10:10] have to do something right as I was
[10:12] saying our Sunday see the children of
[10:14] Israel you know they were fine but you
[10:17] know they couldn't be cursed right so
[10:19] bam said well all right just get them
[10:21] women down there with them men they'll
[10:22] take I'll take care of he'll have to do
[10:24] something so that's what happened in the
[10:26] garden but in the garden as we'll get
[10:28] back to it later the prophet said was
[10:30] fulfill the predestinated plan of God
[10:35] Amen all right now he predestinated by
[10:38] for knowledge not by choosing he doesn't
[10:41] choose he predestines by his for
[10:43] knowledge he knew what would happen if
[10:46] he created man all right but he knew
[10:49] what he would do amen oh yes now we've
[10:52] been through that part to try to come up
[10:53] to the to the point of talking tonight
[10:56] that he knew exactly what he was going
[10:58] to do sure he is this didn't pull
[11:01] anything over on him he didn't say uh-oh
[11:04] things have went wrong so I better come
[11:06] up with a secondary plan you know no by
[11:09] his for knowledge he knew exactly what
[11:11] would happen yes he knew all right so
[11:14] then he knew how to be prepared all
[11:16] right now so it would come down to be
[11:20] then that so you you would I'm trying to
[11:24] cover a whole over viw of the entire
[11:27] point and and you know I told you some
[11:30] people actually believe that the uh what
[11:35] happened in the garden was this is
[11:37] literally the way they believe it that
[11:39] uh Adam and Eve just uh were supposed to
[11:43] got together on down the road somewhere
[11:45] but they goofed up and got together too
[11:47] early and it messed up the plan and all
[11:49] of the things and or either they'll make
[11:52] it just a spiritual
[11:55] happening all right a spiritual
[11:57] happening I gave you that I quoted that
[11:59] the other day but I wanted to read it to
[12:01] you where you know that that you could
[12:03] see it and see what it means so go ahead
[12:07] brother Joe and pull or Brother Anderson
[12:09] pull up number one which is the 70th
[12:11] week of Daniel
[12:13] 6186 all right now we read this the
[12:16] other day but I want you to think on
[12:18] that point the seed of the serpent
[12:20] that's the killer many people don't
[12:22] believe that but if you'll just read
[12:23] Genesis the Bible said that the serpent
[12:25] had a seed and I'll put imity between
[12:27] the Serpent's Seed and the woman's seed
[12:29] it ain't mentioning no other seeds it's
[12:31] just the the two point so the serpent
[12:34] had a seed and if the serpent seed was
[12:38] spiritual see as some people
[12:40] believe then Jesus was not a
[12:46] man so the woman's seed would be
[12:50] spiritual see if you saw it was just
[12:52] spiritual in the
[12:53] garden you know that was just spiritual
[12:56] well then you didn't have no reason for
[12:59] Jesus coming
[13:00] right go see that would be if they both
[13:03] had seeds and the enmity is still there
[13:06] the serpent had a
[13:08] seed all right but now think about
[13:15] it you you may not consider why I would
[13:18] bring up a lot of things but see it's in
[13:20] people's minds what was brought down and
[13:23] and you know had been taught and uh I
[13:26] try to take that out by letting the
[13:29] Prophet take it out am if it was a
[13:31] spiritual seed then the prophet said
[13:33] then Jesus would have been spiritual to
[13:35] the woman's seed cuz we know the woman's
[13:36] seed was Christ all right so that should
[13:39] take it out of people's mind of any
[13:42] thoughts that would you know of being
[13:44] there all right but let's think about
[13:47] something we know that the
[13:51] Messiah was the promise seed
[13:55] right all right to come but I want you
[13:58] to think about something with me for a
[14:02] minute I want you to really get a
[14:05] thought go ahead with number
[14:07] two which is taken from page 99 of the
[14:10] Ephesian Church age which is church age
[14:13] book and he's reading Genesis 3:15 and
[14:16] I'll put imity between thee and the
[14:18] woman between thy seed and her seed and
[14:20] it shall bruise thy head and thou sht
[14:22] bruise his heel if you give credit to
[14:24] the word that the woman did have a seed
[14:27] then the serpent must surely had a seed
[14:31] also now watch
[14:34] it you'd say well well brother Dale you
[14:36] you you you try to do things and and
[14:39] then you read of something that you say
[14:41] the serpent don't have a seed and then
[14:42] the prophet says the serpent does have a
[14:45] seed all right now that's up to you to
[14:48] figure out so I'd pray for a
[14:51] revelation all right but then to try to
[14:55] help you with
[14:56] it the I love to cover something like
[15:00] this if the seed of the woman was a
[15:04] Manchild apart from the
[15:09] man now are you reading
[15:11] it if the seed of the
[15:17] woman all right was a man child
[15:21] apart from the man in other words not by
[15:23] man
[15:25] right it wasn't by man right see of the
[15:29] woman was Christ which was by
[15:31] creation come on no man
[15:33] involved all
[15:35] right see then the seed of the serpent
[15:39] will have to be in the same
[15:43] pattern and that is another male must be
[15:47] born apart from human male
[15:52] instrumentality
[15:55] right right all right
[16:00] so
[16:01] Cain was
[16:06] born some way without human
[16:09] instrumentality are you reading
[16:13] it yes sir see Jesus Christ was born
[16:17] without human instrumentality no man was
[16:19] used Eve didn't I Mary didn't Supply the
[16:22] egg no problem it was all creation
[16:25] virgin birth right so if that's true now
[16:29] so would it be true that the seed of the
[16:32] serpent would have to come into being
[16:35] some
[16:36] way a
[16:40] part not of human male instrumentality
[16:44] come right but by the Beast sir which
[16:47] was not a
[16:49] human not a
[16:51] man all right are you with me are you
[16:53] with the prophet see all he says there
[16:56] is no student who does not know that the
[16:58] seed of the woman was the Christ who
[17:00] came by the instrumentality of God Amen
[17:04] apart from Human
[17:06] intercourse it is also just as well
[17:08] known that the predicted bruising of the
[17:10] Serpent's head was in actuality a
[17:13] prophecy concerning what Christ would do
[17:15] to accomplish what Christ would do at
[17:17] Calvary all
[17:19] right now read that over and
[17:23] over each one of these seeds that we're
[17:26] talking about
[17:29] is going to come without human
[17:33] instrumentality right
[17:37] right all
[17:40] right everybody got that stoked in amen
[17:43] so that would mean God would have to
[17:46] create to bring
[17:48] Jesus Satan can't do
[17:52] it all right so he goes to some other
[17:57] form to try to to bring a seed into
[18:04] being are you with me y but it wouldn't
[18:07] be no human
[18:09] being so it wouldn't be as some people
[18:11] believe that Adam was the tree of life
[18:16] and Eve was the tree of not of death
[18:19] they got together and it brought death
[18:22] that won't work no all right taking out
[18:26] doctrines as we go along
[18:29] but proving something here now
[18:31] amen now if I don't get nothing else
[18:33] tonight I want you to get one
[18:37] thing we spend a lot of time preachers
[18:40] in this message preaching against the
[18:43] women hammering them to death yeah right
[18:48] right and we know what's supposed to be
[18:50] right and told and
[18:53] truth right
[18:55] right and uh we know where the problem
[18:58] was that we know what happened in the
[19:00] garden right we know what's still
[19:03] happening today
[19:05] right the woman is trying
[19:09] to go over the man that's right right
[19:13] because she started out teaching the the
[19:16] serpent which was the Beast standing
[19:18] there and preaching to him y that's
[19:22] right and the brother R said she thought
[19:24] she was right and he said she still
[19:27] thinks she's right
[19:30] right yeah yeah that's right and about
[19:34] 20 years later Cain still had the same
[19:37] idea that Mama had yeah right so she
[19:41] must have been teaching him some more
[19:44] yeah
[19:45] right that's just dropping little things
[19:48] in for you think of but I want you to
[19:50] think about a point
[19:53] now to bring into to being the seed of
[19:57] the Beast
[19:59] which we know it's not called out it's
[20:02] called The Seed of the serpent all right
[20:05] we know it starts with unbelief leads
[20:08] into other things right
[20:11] actuality all right you realize
[20:16] then that through the wound of woman
[20:21] woman L people I say w ear a lot of
[20:23] times and they wonder how you spell it w
[20:25] o m e r n you know
[20:29] Southern
[20:32] okay but through the wound of a
[20:35] woman Came Death right right you agree
[20:39] right right but you know through a wound
[20:42] of a woman came
[20:43] life same wound amen same very wound sir
[20:48] not same person but same wound right
[20:52] came life
[20:54] right so now the thing that we want to
[20:56] holler and scream so much about the
[20:58] women
[20:59] y you know y God uses her
[21:04] y to bring life
[21:10] amen think about it
[21:12] amen the seed of the woman never come by
[21:16] just a physical creation of laying the
[21:18] egg out on a rock or sperm or whatever
[21:20] you know and let it produce he went
[21:22] right back to the wound y to bring it
[21:26] forth amen
[21:33] okay and that's according to the
[21:37] scriptures all right let's prove a point
[21:40] go to number three couple of scriptures
[21:43] just you think
[21:44] of Genesis 3
[21:46] And1 now the serpent was more subtle
[21:49] than any beast of the field which the
[21:51] Lord God had made and he said un woman
[21:52] you you know all right so now that was
[21:56] the seed of the serpent yeah coming
[21:59] through the Beast to bring into what
[22:02] would be called in the seed of the
[22:03] serpent
[22:05] right not by
[22:08] mankind right the Beast wasn't a man no
[22:12] right look like a man right talk like a
[22:15] man but he wasn't a
[22:20] man then what was he well you argue the
[22:26] point but look at the next one in Luke
[22:28] Luke
[22:32] 135 we find
[22:34] that how the the seed of Christ came
[22:38] amen the angel answered and said unto
[22:41] her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[22:43] and the power of the high shall
[22:44] overshadow thee therefore also that
[22:46] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[22:48] be called The Son of God Amen okay now
[22:52] there is two
[22:54] wounds bringing forth
[23:00] not by male instrumentality of the human
[23:03] race
[23:06] right now you can argue the Beast and
[23:09] what it looked like I know what it we
[23:11] understand the message upright and
[23:12] everything else but he wasn't a
[23:15] man because if it
[23:18] was remember in your creation you're
[23:21] going to have to bring all your animals
[23:23] in on about the fourth or fifth day and
[23:25] Man was created on the sixth all right
[23:29] see so you wouldn't intermingle that to
[23:31] try to bring the Beast and the
[23:32] man right you got to put him in the
[23:35] animal kingdom yes sir amen God proven
[23:38] that you had to put him in the anal
[23:40] Kingdom through the prophet he says what
[23:43] animal was used to cause the fall Animal
[23:47] will have to be the sacrifice he didn't
[23:50] say man would be no
[23:53] right that's right the animal all right
[23:57] now
[24:00] so then we know for a
[24:03] certainty that the seat of the
[24:06] woman was Jesus Christ amen all right
[24:12] that came not by
[24:16] man
[24:17] right okay now then the seed of
[24:22] the serpent would
[24:25] be the degrading
[24:30] of
[24:31] mankind right perverting it degrading
[24:36] it uh Hy
[24:41] breing until it would bring in to being
[24:48] mankind now you can follow a lineage of
[24:50] the Beast and and and we will more as we
[24:54] go along a little because you get over
[24:55] to the sons of God saw the daughters of
[24:57] man and and that sons of God would be
[24:59] the the sons of Seth and the daughters
[25:01] of man is the Sons the daughters of Cain
[25:04] brother R says that so you can follow
[25:06] that down even brings it down and he
[25:08] says that seed of the serpent came down
[25:10] in Judas and the seed of Christ came
[25:12] down you know Jesus Christ the seed of
[25:15] the woman all
[25:17] right but my point has been asking you
[25:19] the question why does it
[25:23] say The Seed of the
[25:26] woman when a woman don't have a seed
[25:28] that's
[25:33] right one
[25:35] is you know the Bible speak of it the
[25:39] prophet uses
[25:41] it why is it saying it like
[25:47] that that's my point to get you to
[25:49] thinking past your your uh Cranium cap
[25:54] of the front of your brain that works to
[25:57] let you think well going on back into
[25:59] the subconscious part of you into your
[26:02] brain and subconscious leading down into
[26:04] the
[26:06] soul and the Soul being the real being
[26:11] whatever beginning you to think
[26:15] seriously why would it be called the
[26:17] seed of the woman
[26:24] on when she doesn't have
[26:27] one all right
[26:30] so now let's jump over Brother Anderson
[26:33] I knew tonight wasn't going to go the
[26:35] way I wanted to anyway but let's jump
[26:38] over to number
[26:41] 18a the ones I gave you they the
[26:44] last and a little message I'd invite you
[26:47] to go listen to it asked Wade the other
[26:49] day I said do you realize the the one
[26:51] this message he loves to preach off of
[26:53] Genesis 16 12 126 and 27 a lot you know
[26:57] and uh
[26:58] I said go see what brother randam used
[27:01] as a scripture for Oneness he started
[27:05] off with Genesis 126 and 27 all right
[27:09] but look what he says now this is
[27:10] paragraph 92 one this notice this now
[27:15] the woman was not a
[27:18] seed see back up behind there he's
[27:21] showing you you know that if it if she
[27:23] had a seed she could reproduce but she
[27:26] can't do it she's only got an egg part
[27:29] all right watch therefore he said I'll
[27:31] put enmity between thy seed and the
[27:33] serpent seed telling her that he was
[27:38] going
[27:39] himself to give her a
[27:43] seed not through an intercourse
[27:46] sexually he was going to create in her a
[27:50] seed right that's right
[27:52] now well you
[27:55] say would that be
[28:00] his
[28:02] seed
[28:05] right now would that be his
[28:08] seed whose seed would it
[28:15] be
[28:17] yes it would belong to Mary then after
[28:20] he gave it to her
[28:23] amen
[28:26] amen see that would be his seed the seed
[28:30] the the
[28:33] Christ but then when he gives it to
[28:36] Mary it belongs to
[28:39] Mary
[28:42] okay this is my eye he gave me this it's
[28:46] my eye but he gave give it to me this is
[28:50] my hand he gave it to me this is my
[28:52] voice but he gave it to me see and the
[28:56] seed that was merry had nothing to do
[28:58] with Mary it was something God did
[29:04] himself see now there's your virgin
[29:06] birth
[29:07] right all
[29:11] right but yet think about it
[29:14] now we know for assurity what it would
[29:17] be it would be the seed of
[29:22] God but
[29:25] now how is God going to bring it forth
[29:31] right to work and fulfill the
[29:34] Redemptive work the
[29:39] plan how can God bring it
[29:43] forth could he just
[29:47] speak
[29:50] no so he goes back to the point of
[29:54] what giving her
[29:58] the seed right you remember in Genesis
[30:00] we talking about Sunday where Eve said
[30:04] Heath appointed right me a seed instead
[30:07] of Abel which Cain slew and brother R
[30:11] said see there said she didn't say she
[30:13] got more seed no or whatever said if he
[30:16] did that would have been Christ coming
[30:18] right back there right right but it had
[30:22] to
[30:23] wait see it's called The Seed of the
[30:26] woman
[30:28] amen because it belongs to the woman sir
[30:32] now without the woman where would you
[30:34] have
[30:35] Redemption
[30:37] right
[30:39] amen come on I can just hear them old
[30:41] preachers out there on the internet well
[30:43] he ain't nothing but a I can hear one
[30:45] side saying he ain't nothing what they
[30:46] jna call me a m show and his Pig and the
[30:49] other side would call look there he just
[30:51] he he's he's speaks up for the women all
[30:53] time I try to tell the truth amen why
[30:56] don't you tell it
[30:58] on right right Adam was the one that
[31:00] done the worst part cuz Adam knew
[31:03] exactly what he was doing
[31:06] right but we don't want to blame him we
[31:08] want to hold him up cuz he's the the
[31:12] male but see it's her
[31:15] seed God give it to
[31:18] her but without
[31:22] her how could it ever come to pass right
[31:26] well he could just create well why
[31:28] didn't he
[31:29] right why why didn't he just create he
[31:32] did but now why didn't he just create
[31:36] without any virgin
[31:40] birth cuz he couldn't been a
[31:44] redeemer a redeemer would have to be
[31:46] somebody like us right amen all
[31:51] right and I said a moment ago then if
[31:54] the seed of the serpent is spiritual
[31:57] then Jesus would be spiritual and you
[32:00] would have no
[32:04] Redemption and we read there in Romans
[32:06] ever
[32:08] service it's talking
[32:11] about the Sons and Daughters of
[32:16] God all
[32:18] right and you realize then what would
[32:21] have to take
[32:25] place God we know came down
[32:29] and created an egg and a sperm or
[32:32] whatever you want to call
[32:33] it placed it in the wound of Mary and
[32:36] just bored
[32:40] that and brought forth a
[32:44] child and that child would be almighty
[32:47] God Amen in human flesh right all
[32:53] right so then he wouldn't be becoming
[32:55] God at the River Jordan etc etc that's
[32:57] right amen that wouldn't be working out
[32:59] he was born Lord the Christ all right
[33:05] now so
[33:08] then as it picks up in the
[33:13] story it would mean that that one that
[33:16] would come in
[33:17] flesh would have to first
[33:21] be K folks y right right had to be right
[33:26] amen right amen
[33:28] amen see spoken words wouldn't kin folks
[33:31] whatever you think of mchz that body
[33:33] that could eat whatever he ate that that
[33:34] would no kin to us that was a creation
[33:37] spoke in Spoke out just look like
[33:40] us Jesus had to
[33:42] come as to be a man amen that's all
[33:46] right sir the man amen Christ Jesus the
[33:50] Bible call right all right see then that
[33:54] man could pay the price yes he could you
[33:58] remember in Revelation no man was
[34:01] worthy it's got to be a man so it had to
[34:05] be first
[34:06] what kin
[34:10] folks right to make a kinsman redeemer
[34:13] to fulfill Ruth all right second
[34:18] off to be a
[34:21] redeemer to be able to pay the price
[34:24] would require not that he would send a
[34:27] second person
[34:29] person cuz that wouldn't be
[34:32] right he would have to come
[34:34] himself to pay the price yes sir now how
[34:38] is he going to come into
[34:43] being come on he came into being through
[34:47] the wound of a woman right
[34:51] right sir
[34:53] right didn't let out on a rock
[34:58] put in the wound of a woman so whatever
[35:01] you want to think about the
[35:04] women and I'm just plain language as the
[35:08] prophet said there's nothing worse than
[35:09] a garbage can than a bad woman and I
[35:12] mean a garbage can ain't as
[35:14] bad but he said she's
[35:18] also speaking of all that is good amen
[35:22] sir so now it's According to which one
[35:23] you want to use right sure there's a lot
[35:26] of garbage can need to be pried against
[35:29] y but what about the true genuine amen
[35:34] all
[35:35] right and see that that would come from
[35:40] her would have to be
[35:43] specially
[35:47] designed you know to be able to receive
[35:50] what would take
[35:52] place the body according to Hebrews 10:5
[35:55] a body thou H has prefered me all right
[35:58] so that body we know it's a creation it
[36:00] was the egg the sperm that was placed
[36:01] there the woman was just used as an
[36:03] incubator to bring it forth but remember
[36:07] she did was connected Navy to it and did
[36:10] bring energy through her so she's used
[36:12] we'll get back to her after a while and
[36:14] we'll see what's taking place she was
[36:16] used to energize or what you want to
[36:19] call it through her Naval core was
[36:22] brought
[36:25] life it was not a discon NE from the
[36:28] naval core and just God just plumped a
[36:30] couple of of good pills in there and it
[36:32] produced Christ no no he used the
[36:39] woman all right sisters that put you
[36:42] over on the other side don't
[36:44] it but we just don't go too far on the
[36:46] other side cuz when we do we start with
[36:48] the wrong
[36:50] thing all
[36:53] right but now as it did and as we were
[36:56] reading this the prophet said nobody
[37:00] said everybody knows any Bible scholar
[37:03] or Bible student he said knows that the
[37:06] seat of the
[37:07] woman was Jesus Christ that's right all
[37:13] right so the Redeemer that would pay the
[37:17] price would have to come from the woman
[37:22] amen now am
[37:27] both
[37:32] seeds come through the woman
[37:35] right that's right right come
[37:39] on the seed of the Beast come to the
[37:42] woman y That's
[37:47] right The Seed of God came through the
[37:50] woman both of them was given
[37:55] her come on
[37:59] it was given to Eve to bring forth the
[38:01] Beast child
[38:04] Cain it was given to Mary to bring forth
[38:07] Jesus
[38:09] Christ all right not coming by
[38:13] man
[38:16] right BEC coming by woman
[38:20] right come
[38:23] on it wouldn't have come by
[38:26] man sure we come by the first Adam a
[38:29] first man Adam and the second man you
[38:30] know
[38:32] okay but get the point where'd the baby
[38:37] come now then the prophet
[38:42] says off the message it wasn't so from
[38:46] the beginning number five you can jump
[38:48] backwards with me now we'll pick
[38:52] up e19 and he
[38:55] says Adam
[38:58] was a created
[39:04] son
[39:07] right Adam was his son a creative
[39:13] son when God became flesh and dwelt in
[39:15] the body that he created which was his
[39:17] only begotten
[39:19] son Adam was his son a creative son but
[39:24] Jesus was his begotten son
[39:29] son
[39:32] okay John 1 and4 it says and he was the
[39:36] only begotten of the father right right
[39:41] right full of grace and
[39:43] truth only begotten of the
[39:45] father all right right amen
[39:49] now what would he be called in to tie
[39:53] together to make it all get to to the
[39:56] right place and you'll see what I was
[39:57] hitting that
[40:00] Sunday he's called in this end time a
[40:03] special
[40:05] designation a
[40:07] special um statement about him so go
[40:11] ahead with Revelation 3:14 and as the
[40:13] angel of the Church of the lady of said
[40:14] write these things say the amen the
[40:16] faithful and true witness the beginning
[40:20] of the creation of
[40:25] God you see folks
[40:29] I'll repeat this again if I have time
[40:32] but you know God didn't stop creating in
[40:35] Genesis like we
[40:40] think we think he just created the the
[40:43] world he created he created this created
[40:45] Adam his life's creation where did you
[40:47] get that
[40:51] from if he's the beginning of the
[40:53] creation of God then you've left out
[40:55] your creation of God
[40:58] you've left out
[41:00] your your
[41:02] story yes sir see he's the beginning of
[41:05] the creation of God
[41:07] right which is God in human
[41:10] flesh you say Well when was God
[41:16] created that cell that was created in
[41:18] Mary's
[41:21] W was the beginning of the creation of
[41:23] God
[41:25] amen amen
[41:28] all right go ahead number
[41:31] eight
[41:33] okay some ear in church AG Church AG
[41:35] book see within her wound a cell that
[41:39] would multiply and become the body of
[41:40] Our Lord that cell was created it was
[41:43] the beginning of the creation of God
[41:46] that's who Jesus is it goes on
[41:50] explaining the blood the holy part okay
[41:54] save time go to the next one number nine
[41:56] won't just get a little point across and
[41:58] then we'll drop back on something
[42:02] else and look what he says about him
[42:04] here on the future home of the Heavenly
[42:06] bridegroom paragraph 3:16 the Holy Blood
[42:09] that was created by God the blood the
[42:11] life the creation of God Jesus was the
[42:14] beginning of the creation of God
[42:17] amen amen that's right oh you see
[42:21] it God made in creation right
[42:28] that's right now Jesus wasn't the
[42:30] beginning of any I you know the
[42:31] beginning like that God never existed
[42:33] before then and all at once he come into
[42:35] being he's a beginning now you know
[42:37] better than that cuz he's he created the
[42:39] world and and he's been all the way down
[42:41] and and Jesus Christ come 4,000
[42:43] years later from even the beginning but
[42:47] Jesus was the beginning of the creation
[42:49] of God oh you see it God made in
[42:51] creation he was Spirit the Bible said
[42:53] he's the beginning of the creation of
[42:55] God how did he begin in the wounds of a
[42:57] woman which is what the woman is not
[43:02] like how them blind people can't see the
[43:05] serpent seed right here the Eve was put
[43:08] here on the earth and before Satan ever
[43:10] touched her or anything else God said to
[43:14] them multiply and replenish the Earth
[43:17] right that's right but Satan comes in
[43:22] here and he messed it
[43:25] up but did he he mess it up like we
[43:28] think did he destroy God's
[43:32] plan or did he help him fulfill it as
[43:35] we've covered about that he was to be a
[43:37] redeemer A Healer a savior
[43:40] Etc
[43:42] okay look at the next
[43:46] one let's see that's 357 we read that
[43:50] remember the Holy Ghost descended Upon
[43:52] Jesus which Jesus was a part of the
[43:54] earth why the germ of God the life of
[43:56] God was designed in the wound of a woman
[43:59] that's right which was the Earth all
[44:01] right and then the life of God came in
[44:03] so he was the beginning of the creation
[44:05] of God right now that was a said 4,000
[44:10] years past physical creation so
[44:13] evidently God didn't stop creating
[44:15] right evidently his physical part was
[44:19] just laying the background or the
[44:21] material or getting things in line to
[44:24] come to the bases that he would really
[44:26] bring his true creation into being right
[44:30] right
[44:32] right because it doesn't speak of Adam
[44:34] as being the beginning of the creation
[44:36] of God no right he was the first in the
[44:39] human race yes right come on S but Jesus
[44:44] Christ is the beginning of the creation
[44:45] of God Amen that's right
[44:48] amen that's when he began to bring into
[44:50] being what he really wanted right amen
[44:54] Adam was only an example right
[44:58] right right so he wasn't through
[45:01] creating right
[45:03] man he was just
[45:07] starting right all
[45:13] right so let's just keep
[45:18] reading look at the next one which is
[45:20] number
[45:22] 11 proving his word
[45:25] 1964 8 16 paragraph
[45:29] 183 he proved the word by saying he was
[45:33] Jehovah made
[45:34] manifest he was the beginning of the
[45:36] creation of God God in
[45:39] creation God was a little part of the
[45:43] creation here that God was living in
[45:47] himself he was the beginning of the
[45:49] creation of God from him begets many
[45:54] sons note he also multiplied the fishes
[45:58] the word because he was the word right
[46:00] all
[46:01] right now think with me
[46:05] then the beginning of the creation of
[46:07] God in a physical extin extinct or
[46:11] doings every how you say that
[46:13] word was when Jesus Christ came into
[46:16] being as the seed of the woman
[46:19] amen through the Virgin
[46:22] birth and brought him in as being the
[46:25] beginning of the creation of God right
[46:28] what about being the last age before you
[46:30] bring that
[46:31] out so it would mean this age is to get
[46:34] a revelation of all of it
[46:36] right a little more to it than just
[46:43] that let's
[46:50] think look the next one why it had to be
[46:52] Shepherds paragraph
[46:55] 98 he started a creation what was it a
[46:59] creation of himself God was made flesh
[47:02] and dwelt Among Us that's the the Bible
[47:05] said in the beginning of the creation of
[47:06] God God was created in human form in
[47:10] Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built
[47:14] his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and
[47:17] lived in that
[47:20] Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he
[47:23] built himself a house to live in so he
[47:26] could reflect his word to his subjects
[47:28] through that you know what God is when
[47:31] you see Christ now then according to
[47:35] that as I said you don't wait for him to
[47:38] become
[47:39] God that's why I've always believed
[47:41] about you know since I come in the
[47:42] message and seeing what the prophet was
[47:45] saying see that body was a
[47:49] creation all right it was not Eternal no
[47:55] his body was not Eternal had to be made
[47:57] Eternal
[47:59] all but you are you reading what he was
[48:01] saying
[48:05] here a creation of himself God was made
[48:08] flesh and dwelt Among
[48:09] Us so there's the
[48:14] Flesh and here come at the
[48:18] birth amen come on right was what the
[48:23] Soul and Spirit of almighty God Amen
[48:28] right now you got one God correctly amen
[48:32] and you're not
[48:33] Oneness because you done brought 4,000
[48:36] years of bringing him to to get him here
[48:39] and it still ain't all finished you know
[48:41] why we don't believe in Oneness around
[48:44] here right Oneness means one like your
[48:47] finger and Oneness come to the point of
[48:49] saying that Jesus was the life
[48:51] manifestation of God now I don't agree
[48:54] with neither one of them right sir I
[48:57] believe one thing for sure the bride is
[48:58] the LI IM morphe of
[49:01] God all right now that's right so he
[49:05] didn't stop creating back
[49:09] there I say he's still creating tonight
[49:12] am
[49:16] listen look at the next
[49:20] one this is the seat of discrepancy 65
[49:24] 118 paragraph 35
[49:28] but they finally came
[49:32] forth until both of those
[49:37] seeds the seed of
[49:40] discrepancy and the seed of
[49:43] God put forth their genuine
[49:48] heads and that wound up in Judas is
[49:51] carot there's the seed of gpsy right and
[49:54] in Jesus Christ for for he was the seed
[49:57] of God he was the beginning of the
[50:00] creation of God he was nothing less than
[50:02] God and Judas was born the son of
[50:05] predition Came From Hell returned to
[50:07] Hell Jesus Christ was the Son of God the
[50:10] word of God made manifest Judas SC in
[50:12] his discrepancy was the seat of the
[50:15] devil come to the world and for deceit
[50:18] just like he was at the beginning Cain
[50:21] his former
[50:23] father all right nothing less than God
[50:27] what do you believe about
[50:29] God see most of the people now are
[50:31] beginning to believe that like I said
[50:33] that he wouldn't go out to the River
[50:34] Jordan and then he was just a man till
[50:36] it got there and then PL God makes jumps
[50:38] into the man and he stays with him three
[50:40] and a half years and then he BL jumps
[50:42] back out of him and he goes and
[50:44] dies all right that wouldn't be the
[50:47] beginning of the creation of God
[50:50] Amen if he was just a man that would be
[50:52] a
[50:54] man it wouldn't be the beginning of the
[50:56] the creation of God he couldn't fit
[50:58] Revelation 3:14 right right
[51:03] right so I think about
[51:06] it
[51:09] 14 Ladi Us in church age or church
[51:13] book page 336 the beginning of the
[51:17] creation of
[51:18] God that is who the Lord Jesus says he
[51:21] is but those words don't mean exactly as
[51:24] they sound to us just taking them the
[51:27] way they sound has made some people in
[51:30] fact multitudes of people get the idea
[51:33] that Jesus was the first creation of
[51:36] God now listen to
[51:39] him making him lower than
[51:42] godhead you just spend all this time
[51:45] saying that Jesus
[51:50] was you're same Prophet what's he saying
[51:53] right
[51:56] then this first creation created all the
[51:59] rest of the universe oh but brother Dale
[52:01] the scripture says Jesus Christ created
[52:03] all things amen I'm glad you can read
[52:05] your
[52:06] Bible but you have a revelation
[52:11] right then this first creation created
[52:13] all the rest of the universe and
[52:14] whatsoever it contains but that is not
[52:17] right you know that doesn't line up with
[52:19] the rest of the Bible the words are he
[52:23] is the beginner or author
[52:27] of the creation of God now we know for
[52:32] assurity that Jesus is God very God he
[52:36] is the creator John
[52:38] 1:3 now what's he
[52:41] saying what is he getting
[52:43] to see there is no doubt that he is the
[52:46] creator he goes to Exodus all the
[52:48] scripture he was the creator of a
[52:51] physical or a finished physical creation
[52:55] yes sir absolutely
[52:57] surely we can see what these words mean
[52:59] now to have any other interpretation
[53:01] would mean that God created God how
[53:04] could God be created when he himself is
[53:07] the creator right now get the point yes
[53:12] sir God himself
[53:16] created an egg and a
[53:20] sperm brought forth one that would be
[53:22] called the beginning of the creation of
[53:24] God that's right
[53:32] that's a physical
[53:39] thing now what was in him was not
[53:42] physical
[53:44] right amen what was in Jesus Christ was
[53:46] not
[53:48] physical it was the creator
[53:52] himself James I think it's 3 and9 or
[53:54] somewhere in there where you go the
[53:56] Jesus Christ created all things all
[53:59] right think about
[54:03] it he was a creator of a finished
[54:06] physical
[54:09] creation that looks like it's all
[54:11] finished doesn't it but then when he
[54:14] come to Revelation 3:14 he says it's the
[54:16] beginning of the creation of
[54:21] God all
[54:23] right getting the thought together then
[54:25] what do we see
[54:31] we see two
[54:35] seeds both coming from the same
[54:38] wound you know not the same physical
[54:41] Point Eve was one Mary was the other one
[54:43] come
[54:45] on we see God using that to bring
[54:49] himself into the human
[54:51] race or into being physically can I
[54:55] state it that way
[54:57] right he came into being
[55:00] physically tangible a man to be a
[55:03] redeemer etc etc
[55:07] right the Beast perverted the rest of
[55:10] the all of the human race is perverted
[55:13] except
[55:14] him that's right that's true that's true
[55:17] am none of this physical creation is
[55:20] worth
[55:22] anything right
[55:26] none of the physical creation is worth
[55:28] anything so we better start trying to
[55:30] figure out how is it that we could maybe
[55:34] become a part of
[55:38] this beginning of the creation of
[55:43] God this new creation this new race
[55:46] that's it right because the physical
[55:49] part is not worth anything brother
[55:52] random on the Hebrew series said I hate
[55:54] to think that I i' only five it's
[55:57] old he said because I born in sin shap
[56:00] in iniquity spouse my mother is wound to
[56:02] Liar see nothing in the physical
[56:05] creation is worth anything
[56:09] true he's not going to re you know
[56:14] remodel
[56:20] something but he has to start a away of
[56:22] doing
[56:23] something all right
[56:27] see we like these things but do we
[56:29] really understand them look at number
[56:32] 15 take them from God in
[56:37] Simplicity 63 317 the morning service
[56:40] paragraph
[56:44] 58 they are the Catholic Church talking
[56:46] about them the organization we're free
[56:48] from
[56:49] that we are the
[56:52] continuation of the doctrine of the
[56:54] Apostles do you believe believe that
[56:57] amen I Believe by way of the end time
[57:00] message and things that the faith of the
[57:01] fathers has been restored to the people
[57:03] don't you amen and we are a continuation
[57:06] of the doctrine of the Apostles we're
[57:08] the continuation of the baptism of the
[57:10] Holy Ghost and all the things that the
[57:12] early church stood
[57:14] for and the Catholic church has none of
[57:17] them right all
[57:20] right so we're we're standing in a place
[57:26] look at the next one let's just read it
[57:27] all together proving his word 1964
[57:31] paragraph
[57:32] 146 so he God came down after going
[57:35] through this and not ever son now ever
[57:38] son excuse me that you eat and born of
[57:40] natural sexual birth the way you come
[57:43] then when it comes to a place to where
[57:45] you go through water baptism then Holy
[57:48] Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes
[57:50] down at the fire baptism and claims its
[57:55] creation I'd like to stop right there
[57:57] about an
[57:58] hour and claims this creation yeah right
[58:01] right
[58:02] amen amen that's why I don't believe
[58:04] you're going to get a new body right
[58:07] am because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:10] will be in you get a new baptism of the
[58:11] Holy
[58:13] Ghost it's this body redeemed right amen
[58:17] it's not a new body it's not something
[58:20] different it's this body made new amen
[58:25] right in the resurrection right not rep
[58:28] change
[58:30] Etc
[58:33] all come down into fire baptism and
[58:37] claims his
[58:38] creation same as it did him now he's
[58:40] covering the person and the world
[58:43] right everybody know that come on the
[58:47] Holy Ghost and God is a self Same Spirit
[58:49] see it comes down and claims this body
[58:53] for the resurrection yep
[58:57] and he was raised for our
[58:59] justification all the father has given
[59:01] me will come not one will be lost I'll
[59:04] raise it up at the last day not one hair
[59:08] of the head will ever
[59:10] perish that is the beginning of the
[59:12] creation of
[59:14] God this is the continuation right of
[59:17] the creation of God amen amen then the
[59:20] whole world has to have a baptism amen
[59:23] why because we yeah
[59:26] yep you see the world follows us right
[59:30] we don't follow the world right we're
[59:31] ahead of the world we don't have the new
[59:33] birth already in the soul the promise of
[59:36] the of the the fiery baptism to cleanse
[59:39] all this out to work that will change
[59:40] this body and bring a resurrection then
[59:43] the world gets all of its doings so
[59:45] we're ahead of it oh yes sir amen why
[59:49] because by the new
[59:51] birth we become
[59:56] part of that
[59:58] beginning of the creation of
[1:00:01] God that's
[1:00:05] right he started in Jesus Christ
[1:00:11] amen he had to pay the price he had to
[1:00:14] do all the things but then he come into
[1:00:15] You and I by the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost and what's he doing
[1:00:20] now already laid claims on these bodies
[1:00:23] so we don't have to worry about where
[1:00:24] they're how old they are what Young they
[1:00:26] are what they look like or whatever we
[1:00:27] don't worry about
[1:00:32] it
[1:00:34] now I know why we're here physically
[1:00:37] until the change
[1:00:40] comes We Are a Human Being mortal that's
[1:00:44] right doomed I'm talking about
[1:00:48] bodywise right going to the Grave
[1:00:52] getting older right ain't none of us
[1:00:54] getting younger you can part your hair
[1:00:56] and put it in a different way it ain't
[1:00:57] going to change
[1:00:59] nothing it don't do it you can everybody
[1:01:03] can tell you how good looking you are it
[1:01:04] don't make no
[1:01:07] difference get
[1:01:09] old all
[1:01:13] right but
[1:01:15] see
[1:01:18] he I'm going back to a
[1:01:21] thought the prophet said he was the
[1:01:23] creator of a finished physical creation
[1:01:28] right all right that was back
[1:01:32] there but now do you realize that when
[1:01:36] he came into the
[1:01:37] world and he grew up to the age of
[1:01:40] 30 and there was a river Jordan
[1:01:43] experience an anointing came on
[1:01:45] him to
[1:01:47] claim that
[1:01:50] body right yes sir and you know that
[1:01:54] when he claimed that body he claimed you
[1:01:56] too yes sir amen it's going to take us
[1:01:58] to go through a change come on we know
[1:02:01] the story we got to go through a change
[1:02:04] of the body to be able to be like him
[1:02:07] that way but the work's already begun
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:13] right he was the beginning of the
[1:02:15] creation of God and we're the
[1:02:16] continuation of that
[1:02:20] creation all right
[1:02:26] getting ready for a
[1:02:29] resurrection when he gave you the new
[1:02:31] birth brother collie he didn't just lay
[1:02:34] claims on the soul he laid claims on the
[1:02:37] body and the
[1:02:39] spirit wherever that Soul goes our body
[1:02:44] and spirit will go if we're born again
[1:02:46] Christians all
[1:02:48] right but he was the beginning of the
[1:02:50] creation of
[1:02:53] God and we're the
[1:02:56] continuation of that creation so then
[1:02:58] the Bible says one day we will
[1:03:02] what we'll have a body like under his
[1:03:05] glorious body right right we'll be like
[1:03:09] him what in the
[1:03:11] resurrection but it's already begun
[1:03:14] right that's the Revelation to the end
[1:03:17] time
[1:03:21] right that's a revelation to come to
[1:03:23] this end time right see he didn't stop
[1:03:26] creating back there
[1:03:29] amen he's creating his own
[1:03:33] Bride come
[1:03:35] on all right go ahead to number 17 336
[1:03:39] Lady of sin Church age Church age book
[1:03:41] that's
[1:03:42] right now he's standing in the midst of
[1:03:45] the
[1:03:46] church as he stands there revealing who
[1:03:49] he is in this last age right he called
[1:03:53] himself the author of the creation of
[1:03:55] God God right are the beginning of the
[1:03:57] creation of God right this is another
[1:04:01] creation
[1:04:03] uh-oh so he didn't stop creating right
[1:04:07] this has to do with the
[1:04:10] church whatever he is we are right
[1:04:13] that's
[1:04:15] right this is a special
[1:04:18] designation of the Bride no no no no no
[1:04:22] no you're getting too far out see you
[1:04:24] jumped off this is a special designation
[1:04:27] of
[1:04:32] himself remember we're talking about the
[1:04:36] seed of the
[1:04:38] woman and we're talking about God using
[1:04:42] a
[1:04:43] womb to bring
[1:04:47] forth the seed of the
[1:04:50] woman all right true we not true I hope
[1:04:54] y'all got all night
[1:04:56] amen he is the creator of the
[1:04:59] church the Heavenly bridegroom created
[1:05:02] his own
[1:05:03] bride now watch him watch him get so
[1:05:08] close now remember what he says he
[1:05:10] created his own
[1:05:11] Bride Watch what he said as the spirit
[1:05:14] of God he came down and created in the
[1:05:16] Virgin Mary the cell from which his body
[1:05:19] was born right yes drops right over into
[1:05:22] it I want to repeat that he created the
[1:05:24] very very Sal in the W of Mary for that
[1:05:27] body it was not enough for the Holy
[1:05:30] Spirit to Simply give life to a human
[1:05:32] ovium supplied by Mary that would not
[1:05:36] would have been sinful mankind producing
[1:05:39] a body that would not have been not have
[1:05:41] produced the last Adam of him it was
[1:05:44] said low a body thou had thou father
[1:05:47] prepared for
[1:05:48] me God not Mary provided that body Mary
[1:05:52] was the human incubator and she carried
[1:05:54] that holy child and brought him to birth
[1:05:57] it was a God man he was the son of God
[1:06:01] he was of the new creation amen yes amen
[1:06:05] man and God met and joined he was the
[1:06:09] first of this new race he is the head of
[1:06:13] this new race now he goes into
[1:06:16] Colossians right and ahead there you can
[1:06:19] see that that through man though though
[1:06:23] man was of the old order or
[1:06:27] creation Now in Union with Christ he has
[1:06:31] become the new creation of God right
[1:06:36] right so he goes to the scripture
[1:06:38] Ephesians and this new creation is not
[1:06:41] the old creation made
[1:06:45] over or it would not be called a new
[1:06:48] creation this is exactly what it says it
[1:06:51] is New Creation it is another creation
[1:06:54] distinct from the old one no longer is
[1:06:57] he dealing by ways of the flesh that was
[1:07:00] how he dealt with uh Israel he chose
[1:07:03] Abraham and Abraham's issue Through The
[1:07:06] Godly Isaac line but now out of every
[1:07:09] Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed
[1:07:13] a new creation he is the first of that
[1:07:16] creation he was God created in the form
[1:07:19] of a man now by his Spirit he is
[1:07:22] creating many sons unto himself God the
[1:07:25] Creator creating himself a part of his
[1:07:28] creation this is what I
[1:07:31] love bringing you and I into it bringing
[1:07:34] us into the new creation then look what
[1:07:37] he
[1:07:38] says this is the true revelation of
[1:07:41] God without you and I in it it wouldn't
[1:07:44] be no true revelation of God you know
[1:07:45] that brother around said the godhead is
[1:07:47] not complete without
[1:07:49] you you need that quote I'll be sure to
[1:07:51] give it to
[1:07:52] you this was his purpose this purpose
[1:07:55] took form through election that is why
[1:07:58] he could look right down to the last age
[1:08:01] when it all would be over all would be
[1:08:03] over and see himself still in the midst
[1:08:05] of the church as author of this new
[1:08:07] creation of God his Sovereign power
[1:08:09] brought right down to the ages now not
[1:08:11] just the end time his Sovereign power
[1:08:14] brought it to pass by his own decree he
[1:08:16] elected the members of this new creation
[1:08:20] he predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:08:22] children according to the good pleasure
[1:08:24] of his will
[1:08:26] by his omniscience and omnipotence he
[1:08:28] brought it to P how else could he know
[1:08:31] that he would be standing in the midst
[1:08:33] of the church how could he know if it
[1:08:35] wouldn't by for knowledge predestination
[1:08:38] for knowledge right receiving Glory from
[1:08:41] his
[1:08:42] Brethren I love that if he did not make
[1:08:46] sure all things he knew and all things
[1:08:50] he worked out according to what he knew
[1:08:52] in order that his purpose and good
[1:08:54] pleasure be brought to pass what about
[1:08:58] it right

[1:09:14] Jesus Christ which is church age book
[1:09:16] now remember this Christ in the true
[1:09:18] church is what a continuation of the
[1:09:21] book of
[1:09:22] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:09:24] how that that the Antichrist Spirit
[1:09:26] would come into the church and defile it
[1:09:28] making it lukewarm formal and poweress
[1:09:31] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:09:34] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:09:36] and a discrediting of God's word right
[1:09:38] down to the end time he time he is cast
[1:09:41] into the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[1:09:44] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:09:46] people gets the true
[1:09:48] Revelation right yes sir true Revelation

[1:13:08] Antichrist through a denomination that's
[1:13:11] exactly the truth I may not live to see
[1:13:14] it I believe I will but you young people
[1:13:16] remember that you heard a minister say
[1:13:19] that that finally that'll finally wind
[1:13:22] up and that is the mark of the beast
[1:13:24] when she formed the World Council of
[1:13:26] churches and she'll give birth to her
[1:13:28] son the Antichrist amen so there's going
[1:13:31] to be two births in the end time which
[1:13:33] side are we
[1:13:35] on the other is pregnated by the word of
[1:13:37] God and will bring forth the body the
[1:13:39] finished body of Jesus Christ finished
[1:13:43] finished body which is the
[1:13:50] bride of Christ it isn't finished yet
[1:13:55] right the body of Christ isn't finished
[1:13:57] excuse me I said Bri the body of Christ
[1:13:58] isn't finished yet how manyan he knows
[1:14:00] that a man and a woman is one in Christ
[1:14:02] is one body in the word the bride will
[1:14:04] have to be the rest of that body that's
[1:14:07] right and the two together makes the one
[1:14:09] body again like Adam was at the
[1:14:12] beginning man his wife are one now she
[1:14:16] the true bride so sold out to him that
[1:14:19] she that she used no mind of her own his
[1:14:22] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:14:25] is his word
[1:14:28] y pregnated
[1:14:36] amen Eve got
[1:14:39] pregnated and brought forth
[1:14:42] death
[1:14:45] Mary became
[1:14:48] pregnated not
[1:14:51] by human
[1:14:53] instrumentality but by cre cretion amen
[1:14:56] and she gave birth to the word amen the
[1:14:59] Bride In the End Time amen is to be the
[1:15:05] one who gives birth to the word
[1:15:08] am so the seed of the woman is hers
[1:15:11] right
[1:15:15] am you followed
[1:15:17] it y the seed of the woman is her seed
[1:15:22] right
[1:15:25] there has to be a birth in the end
[1:15:29] time yes of the
[1:15:33] word and that's the seed of the woman
[1:15:35] see that's why it's called the seed of
[1:15:36] the woman it has to always stay the seed
[1:15:38] of the woman right amen we can follow
[1:15:41] the seed of the Beast and see all the
[1:15:42] things taking place but it's the seed of
[1:15:43] the
[1:15:45] woman this is my eye God gave it to me
[1:15:48] the bride in the end time is given the
[1:15:50] word to give birth to
[1:15:53] amen and it's her seed
[1:15:56] y you see that's going a little bit too
[1:15:59] far to say she's the seed of the
[1:16:01] woman
[1:16:03] why she brings forth the seed of the
[1:16:06] woman she the bride of Christ will be
[1:16:08] the seed of the woman what she gives
[1:16:11] birth to will be Christ the word right
[1:16:17] amen that's it
[1:16:19] amen both are
[1:16:22] pregnated the bride is give birth to the
[1:16:24] word s

[1:16:27] preach to you that's all
[1:16:29] right and when she gives birth to the
[1:16:31] word that birth of that seed will be the
[1:16:33] seed of the woman y
[1:16:35] right now follow the
[1:16:40] story it's the seed of the
[1:16:45] woman you see we are the body of Christ
[1:16:52] amen to give birth to this word the
[1:16:58] seed so the seed of the woman is exactly
[1:17:01] right it's her seed God gave it to her
[1:17:03] the bride is not herself she's himself
[1:17:07] made
[1:17:11] manifest that's
[1:17:13] right
[1:17:16] okay one more simple
[1:17:21] thought according to the Book of
[1:17:23] Revelations
[1:17:29] there's to be a lamb in the end
[1:17:31] time Revelations
[1:17:33] 5 that will take the book
[1:17:40] am you go with me Jesus Christ back
[1:17:44] undertook the book right paid the price
[1:17:47] why is it got to be in the end
[1:17:50] time because it's to coming forth again
[1:17:52] of the seed of the woman right Right is
[1:17:55] coming forth again of the beginning of
[1:17:57] the creation of God and us being the
[1:17:58] rest of that creation and what a
[1:18:00] beautiful picture of that lamb that is
[1:18:02] to take the book The Lamb that took the
[1:18:05] book back there was Jesus Christ the
[1:18:08] lamb that takes the book in the end time
[1:18:09] has got seven horns and seven eyes right

[1:18:23] goodness I could get it to to where we
[1:18:25] could see it is he that hath made us and
[1:18:27] not we ourselves we are his people the
[1:18:29] Sheep of his Pastor come on were we in
[1:18:31] the
[1:18:33] scripture the one that takes a book in
[1:18:35] the end
[1:18:37] time is the one who gives birth to the
[1:18:39] seed of the woman which would be Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ we're supposed to give birth to
[1:18:45] the word right right the lamb and the
[1:18:48] life days has got seven horns and seven
[1:18:50] eyes where did it come from your Prophet
[1:18:53] explains where it came from right
[1:18:55] he said it came from the church
[1:19:00] ages coming identically
[1:19:04] back to what was standing in the
[1:19:08] garden in the garden stood the tree of
[1:19:12] life that's right
[1:19:14] amen but also stood the tree of
[1:19:17] knowledge of Good and Evil right amen

[1:19:22] little
