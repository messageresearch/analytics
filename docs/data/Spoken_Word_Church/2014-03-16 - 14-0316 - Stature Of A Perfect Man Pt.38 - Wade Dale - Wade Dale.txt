========================================

good to be back in the house of the Lord good to have you back got it all we going have we going to need a light or something here not right now that's I want to see this let's turn to Second Peter 1 and uh read the scripture here anybody had their patients tried this past week only two bunch of liars oh right that's better okay well some sleep or didn't Kathy must have slept during the week cuz she didn't have her hand up I your was your patience tried this week no you leave a r don't you Hallelujah then ra that's why he raised his hand anyway we've all had our patients tried somewhere whether you realize it or not you did like a go back to again patience Temperance and Patience are two things that you just get banged at every day just bang bang bang your Temperance and your patience because remember your Temperance and patience is what happens externally see faith is what's inside virtue is what's inside knowledge is what's inside Temperance is what goes on out here what goes on around you yes I mean sure you get mad at yourself but we do that all the time but the Bible talks about getting mad at others or being being off with a brother or a sister and um that's external patience is external cuz you got to be patient what what brother R say we're going to read it in a minute he have patience with God first then have patience with your brother all right second Peter 1 according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises thereby these what these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped you see what it says it says that you might be partakers of some divine nature no it says the there's only one divine nature that's God anything Divine has to do with God that's his Divine the divine nature excuse me having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this that was talking about your new birth besides your new birth amen that's beside your new birth it's what we've been talking about forever and ever all this right here is from is your new birth all this but now from here down and besides this and besides your new birth right yes besides your new birth giving all diligence add to your new birth or your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness now we looked up the word there patience is enduring patient countenance steadfastness constancy in other words constant enduring in the New Testament cuz remember the word patient is not in the Old Testament remember it's only starts in the New Testament cuz Moses didn't have patience he didn't have Godly patience speak to the Rock right right speak to the Rock he smoked the rock kill the person killed the Egyptian walks down to the water and looks around and then he goes into EGP I mean he goes into uh the desert with his people and he says what's your PE what's your problem you know in other words he started you know letting them have it for being who they were and U but all also there was a characteristic of Christ there because I think he became patient because the Bible said he was the meekest man in the world so he gained patience with his people but they could not because the had right it could not totally overtake their being let's put it that way it could anoint them like an anointed one it could anoint them on their Spirit it anointed Moses's Spirit but yet it couldn't get into his soul to reside in his soul for him to be a born again believer cuz to be born again you have to be born again all right but they weren't born again in the Old Testament a lot of people don't agree with that but there's thousands of scriptures and uh even I have a quote where brother R said in Oneness with God he said that the disciples were contrary with Jesus then the next quote he says because God wasn't in them yet and that's the truth God wasn't in them yet now d just like we were talking about here now David those two or three chapters of Psalms a lot of that if you'll realize it was what happened at the cross I I was dumb I didn't speak right you know all that we read the other Sunday my bones they stared at me well David was speaking in the first person that was Christ speaking through David but see remember Christ wasn't I mean David wasn't Christ he portrayed a part of it in the Old Testament like I was preaching upstairs the other day about the the Journey of the Genesis one man you can see the Genesis one man down through where brother Bram said I was identified with Moses sure there were certain things I wasn't identified with Moses when he killed the Egyptian I wasn't identified with David when he had his best friend killed to marry his wife committed adultery first and then had his wife killed then had the man's wife but had the man killed and took his wife so but still they had a part of God that was a um anointing uh it would remember the the anointing would come on Moses and his face would shine well see that was God speaking through through the person Moses but when Moses stepped back must I fetch you water you a bunch of rebels you know I mean he he showed a little bit of things that that a born true Born Again believer shouldn't do David portrayed some things uh different ones um what were we talking about the other day Amos or somewhere which one one of them married a itute well now listen that doesn't apply to the day right God's not going to tell you in this hour to go marry prostitute he's just not because the New Birth has come because now it's a cleansing of the Soul now if a sister is a was a prostitute back in the past life and she's born again she's just as righteous is arrest a pure virgin okay there's a difference between a tight and the original that's correct because the original is here that's right because types in the Old Testament even types in the New Testament of the Bride but this is the reality this is the literal part of God this is the part of God he wanted when he said add to your faith and and let me do this it would be nice if you could do that right here it says according as as divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life life and godliness whereby whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature David couldn't partake of the divine nature he had a part of the divine nature that anointed him so Christ was so real even in the Old Testament but it wasn't residing in a group of people as far as a group of Believers cuz remember get this one point Jesus said John was the greatest of all the prophets is that right that's right but the least in the Kingdom see the kingdom hadn't come in the Old Testament that's right thy kingdom come Jesus said thy will be done they weren't in the Kingdom Abraham wasn't in the Kingdom Isaac Jacob Joseph David Moses Noah they weren't in the Kingdom cuz he said Jesus said himself the least in the Kingdom right is greater than John that's right because they have the new birth residing now John had the Holy Ghost portion but not a residing of the Holy Ghost cuz I'll promise you one thing when they went to John in prison and John started going well was that Jesus or not now that was John right that wasn't a holy ghost if you was a newborn believer and you saw Jesus Christ I'll guarantee you'd know who it was and you wouldn't ask him 6 months later are you the one that's right amen so John didn't have the new birth but he had the Holy Ghost that's right you said well it is the same but it's not the same everybody understand that it is the same but it's not cuz brother B said you have the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell the Holy Ghost he didn't say the new birth that's right he never said the new birth that's right so the Holy Ghost comes but you got to have a new birth to drive that unclean Spirit out right problem with David he still had an unclean spirit that he led after a man's wife yet he could stand back in the temple as a prophet and do the things of a prophet go in and eat the shoe bread go in and do the different things because God knew the Integrity of his heart all right you got a question oh I was just say a while ago you talked about being identified with parts of like Moses and and I just thought can that apply to today I mean I mean cuz when I come here around everybody by the end of the day I just feel like I'm alive you know like I wasn't during the week I mean can can you say that we identified with each other like that if you got the new birth you definitely are the same yes person yes right right a one you got the same person a but one a one a but one that's why that's why people I'm telling you not just for you sister free everybody it's so important to come to church God instituted it and never took it out he said don't forsake the assembling of yourself together and much more as the day approaches the problem is we don't think it's much more we don't think the day approaching cuz we don't come to church like we used to brother BR said a holy ghost filled person cannot wait for the doors to open now that's your Prophet nothing I've said if it makes you mad then tough he said talk to him about it not me he's the one that said it he said a holy ghost filled person cannot wait but that's if you're being said good yes last why 5 minutes till 9: this morning I get all antsy and I start grabbing stuff I get jun's pocketbook and I get all I'm ready to go out the door why I want to be in church I don't want to be early I don't want to miss something Ain just cuz we got to hook all this up this is easy now this an easy hook up I can do this in an instant and don't need some of these computer geeks to help me and thanks to Sister Rebecca she got one that I can have here and one I can leave at home so praise the Lord what was I doing steadfastness let's let's get on to this or we're not going to ever get finished with P we're have enough patience to get finished with patience a patient steadfast waiting for enduring sustaining perseverance when you see the word they that wait upon the Lord what is that word wait patience persever persevere Paul run a race he run a race to win that's what we're supposed to do we're not supposed to lay down and and let the Devils cuz you look what we were reading David we were reading David and he was right here on he was on a high then he got on a low then he got back on a high then he got back on a low then he got back on a high why because he was constantly fighting with that thing that was inside of him God would anoint him to do something and then he said oh my iniquities reach all the way to heaven well see mine and your iniquity should be gone as far as our soul and our new Earth sure we sin every day but iniquity is to do it and know not to do it now to sin willfully there's a problem there when you talking about David H brother bandom I said that where the scripture says David was a man after God's Own Heart he said you know why because he repented he repented that was the difference in David and maybe Saul Saul was maybe a little bit exalted in himself David would do something and he I'm sure after going to the bed of basa he probably repented all day and all night but he couldn't get that off of him he didn't know how to get that off of him right but we we as being born again Believers we have a way to get that off of us cuz the devil can anoint our spirit that's right no no let me refr let me rephrase that he will anoint your spirit that's right I say he can he will doesn't he play in your memory that's right doesn't he play in your conscience that's right affection that's right imagination right all those things all right he plays in all that memory reason conscience affection imagination all those things man that's where he placed but he can't get in the soul of man if you're born again so what we have to do is is we have to take this inward work and make it go out we have to take the inward work and make it push out all right be patient have patience bear long suffer long to be of a long Spirit not to lose heart to persevere patiently and bravely and enduring misfortunes and troubles that was David you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but there shall not a hair of your head perish in your patience possess ye your souls all right let's get on over here and read what brother R says we had got to that yet but just a little bit let's reading statute of a perfect man he's talking about knowledge when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh God see but the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will pass away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you haven't just a manmade halfway SED up belief or Temperance oh ought to slap him down but maybe I better not everybody reading that yep maybe I better not cuz somebody might say me put my name in the paper that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with a sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith no wonder the church is so short isn't that right no wonder I'd say repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and a strict tarian don't believe that said oh Antichrist he's a Jesus name he's Jesus only Look Out Boy I don't know about your Temperance right now why don't you come say let's reason this together brother ROM I'd like to hear this explain then come down and listen to it all right so let's go on then after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith if you got faith it work as patience all right if you got faith it work as patience the Bible said see so this is patient now that's the next thing going to build this stature you know God is got real material in his building see how short we are brothers sisters see see why where we're at yes sir we have Glory we shout things because we got faith but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature you reading with me can't build that we got mean we got faith we got the new birth right he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things we fall slide off of it he can cannot build his church or can't build his church paragraph 233 patience with what what kind of patience first thing is have patience with God okay first thing patience with God in other words patience with God that he'll do what he said he'd do okay right that's why Abraham had Faith he was the father of our faith he said God you said it you going to have to make it happen cuz I can't make it happen all right problem is what we try to do is we try to help God yes right yes we do and we try to do it our way and we mess up first thing is have patience with God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith work is patience that's right when God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience say well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just to sit oh my what patience God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign actually it got worse he was still believing he was patient with God mhm put him always before you let him be the next Crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so and it's going to happen see keep him before you that's right Noah had patience yeah Noah had real Godly patience God said I'm going to destroy the world with rain and no preach 120 years yet 120 years and only as f family listened to him and his family doubt it a little bit cuz watch what brother Brown said then God tries your patience that's right God tries them after he told Noah now Noah I want you to go ahead and get in the ark and that new Noah movie is coming out Mark 28 so it it would be something I've seen the previews and I I think it it it's very scriptural so I'd go take a look at it don't Advocate going to movies but that would be something to watch because man has always said that 40 days and 40 nights of rain would never flood the Earth it didn't the Bible says The Fountains of the deep opened up so you can see Noah looking out in the trailer you see Noah looking he's on the boat and he looks out across the landscape and all of a sudden these big water like water pipes but it's water come shooting up out of the ground and uh that's where the fountains of the deep opened up cuz remember there was no rain that's what it that's why it made it more impossible for Noah to preach that it was going to rain cuz it never rained before so the scientists and the people of the world said they ain't enough water to come from up there to flood the whole world but they just didn't know that they were walking on the thing that was going to open up and cause all the catastrophe right under their feet not coming from above cuz man destroys himself always no I want you to go ahead and get in the ark I'm going to run the animals in there I want you to get in climb way upstairs now so you look out the top window now once you get in in there I want you to tell those people tomorrow what I've been pre tomorrow tell them tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them then we skip on through said now we got that way we got that way add it but if you ain't got it that way don't try to add it it won't work won't work on healing won't work on nothing else see it's got a blend with the same material it's vulcanized too so you got to have the new birth for patience or anything else to oriz with it right because your New Birth has all that in it the New Birth has all the Perfection all the Genesis 126 man doesn't have to be perfected the Genesis 1:26 man is perfect that's right that's God that's right never send a day in his life never had iniquity never did anything wrong that's right but what's on top of that is when you're born into this world with a fallen nature and you got a spirit on all that that's not the Holy Spirit that's right yeah mhm that takes and it runs you into the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which we were born on and it brings us up here not down here everybody understand what I'm saying it brings up here man's knowledge not you know God took the heart man took the edge right so same way with these things even when you're born again though you still got to come right back out and go through the justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost process all over again only on a higher level now we've taught that here forever so so it shouldn't be anything you know strain but it's a process it's always justification just a higher form brother Brown said there's a mysterious part of justification Luther didn't have that mysterious part Luther had justification the just shall live by faith that's it but the mysterious part of justification is is you never done it in the first place did right you're Justified you we got to realize that that's what the message brought if you don't ever realize that you're not going to get this guy changed cuz you're going to condemn yourself where you're not going to take a body change but this statute of perfect man is put in the order of us to get a body change that's right that's right I said in the order cuz brother random had this and he didn't take a body change that's right but you have to have these things that's true before a body change can come right all right you can't Skip and go around and say well I'm just in the message I'm going to take a body chain I hear that and it makes me sick actually because nobody knows the steps or the journey to go through that brother brandham laid out it's not something doctrine that we preach here it's a doctrine that brother brandham tried to get us to see that it's not just be born again and get a change of the body right you get born again you going to die and go by the grave and then you'll get a body change because you have to be purged that's a purging of this man that's right not a purging of the Inside Man the inside man's perfect that's right that's right the inside man's perfect that's right it's this guy it's the one we were born when we were born in this domain we got a nature that was contrary to God right and that Nature's got to die but as that nature dies though you still got a spirit on that called memory reason conscious affs and Imagination that's where Satan runs wild cuz he can get into your spirit and work but he can't get in your soul if you're born again but you can take what's in your soul work its way out and become a stature of a perfect and not a statue right stature is height growth development a statue is just a statue but this is a stature it's a height or a growth growth development all right W work on nothing else same until was vulcanized too that's right got to add it he had patience with God 120 years and if you go on to the story which I cut out for time brother Brown said they got into the ark and remember it was 7 days before it started raining God shut the door of the Ark and he said his daughter or his daughter-in-law comes up and says Noah you you sure it'll rain he say then his son's come up and said now Daddy I know you preach for 120 years and we're sitting in this hot stinking art when's it going to happen he said it will rain see he never lost right then he could have lost all of his all of his profession right there all the circumstances made it worse that's why tribulation worketh patience if you don't have any tribulation in your life you're not going to know whether you got patience or not right yeah let me ask you a question and everybody I'm pretty sure everybody experienced it but I and I've been praying and asking God to help me with it but you know how when you're driving alone and and you know that the people that you see we we got the U ex Street and this guy come in and he's he's he's coming in from nowhere and he's speeding up to get in front of you my patients I've been trying to do it I get such an attitude because he knows that he's not going to turn off but yet he's trying to get in front of you and I'm doing better because now I want to know how do you get that that feeling that you you don't get upset about it but it's still in your heart that you say well you know this this this person is going crazy and you know when somebody cut you off you yeah that's wrong you quit running them off the road right no I never run oh you never okay but saying everybody experien that how do you get the the feeling that this person listen hey it's always going to rise up because that old man sure is dead but that man that's on top of that Spirit that's anointing your memories and conscience it's going to bring stuff up I mean it's going to pop her up just like this I mean see that's the trial that's coming it would be a lot easier to just be driving down the road and you in this fog and you know you you think you thinking I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I've got God in my heart and I'm just singing and all of a sudden the guy jumped and pray you just keep keep right on singing and no no you stop singing that's what I'm saying and you thoughts go through your mind and God knows every thought and God knows every thought whether it's just you in the car by yourself or not there's recording Angels sitting over there going what is she say can we take that back the garden that's where this has got to push it back down that's what I'm saying it's got to push it back down so we just practice on pushing it back down or we practice on pushing it back down I do the same thing you wonder why people do what they do they're just siners yeah and then if you drive low you can't drive from me stop driving you can't drive for me in the back and you going to blow and tell me to go faster cuz you see the light is turning yellow I get an attitude and you the whole thing is I want to get rid of best thing do just wave out just say God bless you I have that problem too just say God bless you and don't whether they hear you or not but okay they you know they may have problems I have they may have problems they need to get to work early or whatever leave home earlier and don't blow but you can there's no way you can take 300 million Americans and make them do that but I'm saying that's what I said you got to control your environment regardless of what's in this environment so God gave God give you something in you to just if that little radar thing goes up a little bit just just just let it go back down because before you would that so and so that and you want to run them off the road and you want to ask them why did they why do that why you need to ask them anything they they have no they don't care who you are but I want to be when when they give you know the finger or whatever you say God L yeah sure you a woman gave me a three mile burden not too long you know when me and ter was working buddy she laid that finger up put on thing right there like and she never stopped she just kept driving and she laid that fer she ter was trying to speed up so he could wave at her you know I mean we made it fun of it but she was mad that's a world record you get a three mile bird you know usually they flip you off and take off but no this lady later I thought her finger had got jammed or something you know thought she had a cramp or something but I looked over there buddy she had it laid on the Wind window you know just laying it to me but anyway I mean to make a joke out of it now you before I might have run that woman off the road get shot yes you know what what might be helpful in this situation is the white dog and the black dog which one do you need more because it sounds like you you're holding on to that you need to think about Jesus at that time no that's what I'm saying but comes like second nature it's going to come out it's going to come up because that's the part of the nature you live with you got to say okay Jesus God bless you but you decrease in what's what's going on you know you don't get as angry at and I I know that but you say you holding on you say well one day the first thing going hit my mind oh that person must have a problem let me slow down when get in front of that's a good idea good now why can't you do that I I have to do I have to I have to think about listen we have to because by Nature I have I see listen let me give you scripture by Nature we are children of Wrath that's the Bible That's Right By Nature that's right the children of Wrath that's right everybody we we we we get up hating people and we go to bed hating people that's in our normal life but now I was going to be um short today but we'll pick this up next Sunday I know y'all had question Rachel help to you know just think about they might be having something going on in their life at that time and so I like to think about that you know no matter what I go through because you know brother talked about that waitress she was having a bad day and you know it doesn't help to get red up about that I mean these people could be rushing to their kids baseball game or or to doctor every time I see somebody broke down side of the road I say God send them somebody I'm not going to stop but God send them somebody and bless them I do it I honestly I might miss one out of a hundred but most of the time if somebody's on the side of the road I'll say God send them somebody and bless them amen and you know I don't care if they're a sinner or a saint it don't matter to me okay so that's what you got to do you're not got not to put levels sin or Saint doesn't matter Tre them all the same the problem is what I do a lot of people say oh I went to Walmart and I had to hear that old music and that's all naked and all that you know what I do I just focus on what I'm going in there I think every one of them are sinners they're doing exactly what they're supposed to they're doing what they're supposed to do they're doing exactly and I'm suppos to we're supposed to do what we're supposed to do what I'm suppos to
