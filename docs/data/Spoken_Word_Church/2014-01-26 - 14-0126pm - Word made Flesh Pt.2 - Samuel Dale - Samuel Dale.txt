for all things as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts because we desire that more anything else in life have your weigh-in guide us in Jesus name Amen okay John 1 1 through 14 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and light shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not the words that couldn't stop it it's not comprehended if they there there's no way they can the world can comprehend but it can try to hinder you know in doing and it's tried it's best but he can't do it since there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might be believed he was not that light but was sent of our witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which was born not of the which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth 1st John 1 that which front was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested in with seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we to you that your joy may be full and we're to the end time is where we're coming down especially right this this then is the message now what's the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now not to back up too much but to tie together this morning to where we can try to move on in the message and doings brother Aaron could you come up and click at least to our home because some are going this away someone going this away just click the click it where the arrow run it metal air-conditioner will take care of itself all right now we were talking about what the word made flesh now we're reading a little bit that the prophet says the word made flesh is the light of the age it's done clicked on itself now Aaron so I guess it took care of its own self it heard me but see the word made flesh you say yeah but that was Jesus Christ well I know that we know the scripture and what it's saying but think about that there's a word for each age and there's somebody to make that word manifest all right then if we believe what Moses was there he made it manifest David was dark he made it manifest Joshua was there he made it manifest etc etc coming through and then we come down through the ages and this is what I'm talking about we come through the ages in each age had a word to be made manifest are revealed to that age well then somebody will have to be there you know or has been there to make that manifest you know and that was the Bible being written that we were speaking of this morning as the Bible being the Word of God it being the revelation of Jesus Christ but in that revelation of Jesus Christ it is showing not just the point of Jesus Christ in one God and water baptism and things like that it's showing also that there are is a people or have been a people and I believe is the people now to make manifest the word or the hour then when we leave here there will be a redemption for the Jews that will be up to them for their word and their day they're not in this day they're not trying to manifest him as you know we are they're not trying to talk about a rapture their interest is their homeland and and you know what future they could receive from that but see that's that's a word that would be made manifest all right we were talking about in the prophets said there have to be somebody to make that manifest all right it has been spoken right now see then don't forget and we will go in the Lord willing next Sunday we will be trying to talk about more like the the ages and how that things turn out to be a carrier and all but then coming out to the full word because we believe that Jesus crisis was covered in this morning he was the word in full well and he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily and he was God made manifest in human flesh are the word made flesh or why can't we believe then that as seeing the ages the time the people that that was God made manifest for the time they the word forever age their a seed remember it's not the person that comes free destinated eternally 154 Church age book but it's to see their word alright the rest comes by for knowledge in the basis that that for knowledge allows him to know where that seed will land and who would be what what see then when Martin Luther we try to connect the end of those type of things when he began with a just shall live by faith that was the word of that age he was not responsible for the seals the things that you and I understand that was not the age he was living in he was living in the age of the manifestation of the word of God to counteract the teachings of the Catholic Church and the things that had brought it into a total works and paying your way and in doing all the things and as long as you could pay God forgive but if you couldn't pay he didn't forgive mostly then that would not be in any basis it that we poor folks could handle you know and it would make very poor and it has around the world made nations very poor you remember the Prophet saying communism the reason it rose in Russia was what because of the Catholic Church bleeding the people for the money no what's the church the word has got to be made alive and it has been now get my point and let's move on there would be no one should be argue that the word has been made manifest by somebody in every age all right so like I said you got Luther with a just shall live by faith he made that manifest then you got Wesley coming along with sanctification he made that manifest it might have been into a form of works in some ways but still it was the word of the hour it was the seed of the hour that was predestinated they are you listening to come to pies because it's the seed our word that's predestinated eternally so there is no way to get out of what you know other than look back and say thank you Lord for fulfilling your word right see then when Azusa Street came 1906 he that was a manifestation of God that's what gets me then when I hear people you know people know big names and think oh the Pentecostal false well you think he'd listen to me quote and brother branham tell him what it was now you didn't listen to me he went right on don't you come right here that night and said it again you know that Pentecost was false there was a false part of Pentecost yes but Pentecost wouldn't Fox Luke that wouldn't false Wesley wouldn't false it was the light of the age the badness wouldn't fall false the Methodists the Presbyterian they all had word coming forth see for the age that they were living well but then we look at it and say well well we don't see too much and that's a favorite thing today because the way the devil has of attacking us well we don't see much going on you talk about us being the word well who's gonna do it it's in the Bible you know what you'd be if you live back in Luther's day don't believe nothing go no he just fanatic he just got it all a little idea you try to draw a following and that's what they thought about brother Branham when the message came what you see think about it if we were a part of God before the foundation of the world has the eternal life that we have within us and I believe that's the only part that was dark then by having eternal life makes me part of God and we were quoting this morning where brother Branham said it he said that God is not complete without you why because he chose it that away sister seed coming down that God predestinated eternally people are predestinated by foreknowledge do you see why I could have stayed a long time back there on that people come predestinated by foreknowledge the world and the things you and I are the same way before knowledge but that word our seed he was going to see it done will get next week the Lord willing to jaw or he said I will restore God promised it well why can't we just believe that we're part of it why can't we accept it it's being that it's easy to look back and see what somebody else was then look forward in a hopes of somebody and maybe being able to attain well now in the days of Luther when he brought the message there was a lot of people rebelled against that and a lot of people believed it right but still he he didn't care why because God had spoke to him what about a Moses of the word of his hour when that when he was dire in Egypt he was next to Pharaoh wouldn't he he led two armies he was in charge all he had to do would just take over when he suffered the reproach of Christ counting it greater riches to go through all that he went through yes for Christ and that was a man without the new birth why would we have trouble bleeding who we are now if we got you know we are in the day of birth certificates etc etc you know to prove who we are but you know right now the greatest proof you have of who you are you know what it is they might do what is it no that's mr. partner and I'm done about in the natural do you know the greatest thing to prove who you are is your telephone number everywhere you go they got to have it birth certificates are so much counterfeited driver's license marriage license any kind of license all of that has been so copied or you know until it no longer good he said I won't take my my birth certificate down do you know another thing that your record in a church of being baptized and the day you was baptized well you want to call it christening where you own the caller that's a better record than your birth certificate you go down now to get your driver's license what do you got to do come on win Georgia I gotta get mine pretty quick you gotta have about three proofs who you are take your birth certificate in let down the old driver's license will you picture on it and you're standing there looks like that'd be enough no mm-hmm your telephone bill your electric bill you got to take something else besides your birth certificate right to prove who you are well as I said about your telephone number see the reason they want that is because everybody has a telephone number he said was social security number no there's so much falsified about it you know until it's just they've done that only one time they had guy was drawn trying to draw unemployment the same time I tried to draw it they held mine for about three months before I got it see somebody had copied my social security number like the security man talking to me one day because we purchased a bunch of stuff he wanted know if it was me I see you guys at me and I said but I'm not gonna give you this out of the other he said look feller he said don't worry about it he said I can get your social security number he said all I got to do is just keep typing do I get it yeah but he said the thing just don't do that don't tell them the secret things that you put on your credit card you know like your mother's maiden name your your etc and he said the expiration date is a great thing on it see there's something my point eaters to try to prove who we are and like a man told me one time he said you wouldn't try to get some credit I think Zach did too and he couldn't get no credit he didn't know nobody but couldn't get no credit then there are certain things that you've got to have to prove who you are what's your point brother Dale I'm not trying now we believe in Luther's justification I believe in that I believe in Wesley's sanctification right I believe we must go through that in this day justification sanctification before we can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you burn I believe in that all right but yet I'm not trying to preach Luther's message that's where you see the people of the message of preachers you know just believe just believe just believe just really believe the Prophet that's Luther's message all right what's the others Wesley's message what don't cut your hair don't punch your face don't don't worry these clothes don't do this don't do that that's Wesley's message well what's the other part of it Pinnacle's I have within me I feel the Spirit of God and it verifies it as the Spirit of God because it agrees for the prophets message I've heard a lot of people say that they had the spirit that agreed with the prophets message but when I got through talking a little bit they of course didn't like me but you know how it is but listen Church the point is what we're not trying to manifest the words of the other ages that is not the seed for this age this is the age of the fully matured word it's not the age of Luther or the west near Pentecost so we don't have to worry about being that let's find out what it is for this age we know what that he is right it's the messenger the hour to message you the hour has a lot in it it's got to be made manifest why because I'm a firm believer they without us could not be made perfect I've made my people to a plane about the latents the things being blunt could have always been that way honest never said nothing about this that or the other but I do believe that that prophets in the grave waiting on you and I to come to the place in the message to pull him out I do believe that but now see them to do that we must be the word of the age we told me this morning there's a man here they could turn on the lights where he said you always send somebody that the word can get into my foreknowledge God knew everybody'd be sitting here today right now he didn't make you come because that's overriding here free moral agency but he knew you'd be here all right and he knew that you would be in this age trying to believe this message okay and in doing that see then there'd be somebody as we said this morning that would make that word manifest I believe and will prove in a few minutes from some quotes that you and I have to be the word made manifest and not just as a part as we'll get to it the Lord willing Sunday when the Prophet will say that Mary was not even the seed then we know she was in the basis that she was a child of God but she was not the seed in the example he was bringing he said she gave birth she had it in her womb but she's not the seed he said the prophets were carriers what you see he allotted so much word for each age we gave you that this morning kind of down at the end and allotting that word for the age that you and I are living somebody's gonna make that alive sure it has to be quickened but before it can be quickened it's got to be planted all right to admit they would have to come a prophet to preach the entire word right you remember what what was one of the last ones that we we come to oh yeah we're talking about Feast of the trumpets he said now remember God is the word in each age has allotted he has lauded the word for each age that would be on the earth he lauded it in the church age and the seven seals revealed every bit of it so the seals opened up to reveal what the word that was to be in this age okay so there's got to be a word has got to be it's veiled as we covered this morning he said you it's veiled you realize that Satan cannot um this is mr. point but you don't Satan we think he's really after us if he ever realized in his mind remember what he's got who we are you ain't seen nothing yet you think that the devil died for us he's kind of like brother Moke told me one time he said the devil's after me he said my water pipe busted I said brother mo it's twenty something years old the things were out that ain't the devil after you of course we thank that I had a flat the devil's after me I'm sick the devil's after me that's life that's living when he turns ever friends you got against you when he turned everything against you and one day you go to doctor and the doctor says unless you own OCO Cara you know you know what I mean now calling his name too much you know if you ain't on there we can't treat you we've seen nothing yet folks you label the devil realizes we are what we say we are be gonna come after us it's been preached by the Prophet it's been told us right into the rapture we don't have to have somebody else to come and tell us something he's already priestess to the rapture all right but somebody's got to make it manifest now I believe the devil was after brother Branham don't you why because he could certainly see that he was the word for the hour and the prophets message and the thing to be made manifest in the day so he attacked him on never hand turning everybody against him doing everything see because he was istream he didn't bother with the Lord Jesus when he was healing the sick right now come on him a rock I tried to make a biblical point out of it he didn't bother Jesus until he began to say I and my father are one my brother brother said when the bride says that then the devil is coming after the bride wouldn't begin to say I and my father are one well in a way we are don't worry about that they don't concern him at all and I hope you remember think about this in the right way I'm not against any of these people that come out in the message and do the things but you ever notice somebody come along with a new idea right people just flock to it old and young they just flock to that let's see the devil he kind of goes along well because he realizes they're seeing something different so he wonders yeah who it is he's wondering if it was the truth or not but then after a while he just slides in and everything goes haywire he just backs out dying the life and said that wasn't it come on can a quote said I thought I got you when I got Moses and isn't that in the other he said I'm sure I got you when I got John the Baptist John the Baptist wasn't too bad even introducing the Messiah but wouldn't again tell Herod he wasn't supposed to be held that wife then he got in trouble he got a little marriage and divorce hooked up his messes huh what you see Church when the bride realized who she is and what she's here for Satan's go to come after her but as long as we keep playing around go on but what do you mean brother then I go to church I'm their ever service that's a good record we'll give you a star a gold button or something you know is it a drudgery to go to church no it should be an enjoyment right if I could do that in the Baptist Church and that won't and I'm throwing that back that away okay land it in your lap okay if we could do that then what about now but do you realize what I'm getting out we've had the message right are you looking for another prophet to come no not to the Gentiles all right then why sit around twiddling their thumbs waiting on somebody and isn't that the way it generally happens you let things start moving and people just run to it I said there's 40 years ago cuz I quoted brother random about probably ten years before the anymore when he said they had come a time when the Methodists and the Baptist would be healing the sick and the things would be happening in the church he was evidently looking at it you know so now when you begin to talk about manifestation they said what are you talking about we got more than you got in a little our cases a half but see they're not trying to be one thing the light of the age they're only concerned with being going to church being good building giving away right and there's nothing wrong with all of that no problem but listen Church if God is not complete without you then he's waving with you and I to realize that yeah but I just don't understand I mean I don't understand either I don't understand how you and I certainly don't understand I took me I mean I thought if that's not just throwing into remark I don't see how I told you about the time when that men passed me going down the road a Baptist preacher you know the Lord why in the world did you choose me and didn't choose him well that man was so popular so great a God I mean great no words ever against him it took it was eight preachers I believe was the number they preached a man's funeral he was known by everybody in the country as a good man and good you know I said Lord why did you choose me to allow this word to be revealed to me well then after a while he said well maybe he turned it down somewhere you see that could be true I don't know I'm still saying why did he choose any of us but he won't somebody well what we won't is a group when sister so-and-so gets traitor brother Shawn's will get straight we're always trying to find trouble in the church don't worry about it there plenty of it but when you're trying to find trouble in the church you're the trouble I don't back up why probably said first pray right he said go run your mouth he said pray but listen Church the word of each age had to have somebody and it's come down to this age we're not in those other ages we've got to find this age and find the word that's predestinated from God eternally we want to look at the vessel to this in we want to doubt the things that it's in unless in another day we was a brother branham we tell them in Isaiah he said a man like me with faults and failures this way says but said God gave him the word what about the age we're living God is the word in each age has he he has blotted the word for the age that would be on the earth and the seven seals revealed every bit of it so then we're not looking for somebody to talk about something else if somebody come along now and started talking about the great millennial reign is next what would you say he said the next thing is a great millennium I'll give you that quote a lot of time that no we're brother Brown said if I don't see you no more see to future home people for next things a future home prophet said it no he's already said there's a rapture the tribulation a millennium a white throne like a fire and all as I and then the future all know somebody comes along now start telling you about this great millennial rang with Nixon Anna that's a wellness he his opinion certainly ain't mine no the next thing according to me is a rapture right you ever studied some of the Jehovah Witness doctrines about things you realize what I'm getting at though their ideas according to what I've talked to him their ideas we're going along here today and tomorrow I witnessed in this great utopia but we're all going to work well driving school bus as well but everybody's happy I don't think that's gonna be at you but you see the church what I'm getting at we have a word and we must make that word manifest see we want to lay there vet on brother branham is that the way he said it did he say it this way he said we want to put it on the preacher and let the preacher do to pray anything he said that is Catholicism paraphrasing you know what he said it was he said the Pope come out of that hey I got to do all your praying if I got to do all your stuff give me a billfold I mean if someone get prayed for you laugh at that that's what the Catholics do right you pay you pay you pay they do it for you well no we don't believe in that no believe in trying to be the word of the agent we're living and that's all I've ever preached for forty some years now is to try to get to you and I'd to see who we are the first message I preached in 1969 in Athens Georgia was the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man Holly eyes Athens Georgia the bride would be the son of man you know what I had to keep saying brother Bradley's not the son of man brother Branham is a son of man God every time I turn around that thing is hitting me we've had these on a man right around his dick no we brought around a wouldn't be son of man he said he wasn't he said he was ice on a man what he done that to fool you well he done a good job but listen Church there's a predestinated seed it comes predestinated eternally right seed our word so ever age was predestinated better unsaid about that little woman as well he could have said how could that seed I forgot to exact wording but he said work its way down into that situation but it works looked like it would come into high priest or somebody else right but instead it worked out a little prostitute waiting on the lot to strike he's kind of like I remember brother would be saying what time that is a good point he said people don't think too much of me some way paraphrasing it but he said they want an Abraham he said willing did you get your Abraham said he gave his wife away in lied he said at least ain't never gave him a wife away well that was a good point but listen many are the flaws I'm not quoting for the church age book of those that lied cheated steal done all kind of thing but yet they were the word benefit for the Aged there were they be Martin Luther you believe he was he in the message he brought was the word for that age you believe that you know he was a Trinitarian you know he didn't want to I've got his own riding he didn't want to leave the Catholic Church he wanted to convert it moat to pop and sit in the pub drinking beer are you throwing off on it no he's telling the truth about him you know what he said one day fight am I wrong in this now if I am correct me he said the Jews ordered me took out to be killed because they killed Jesus Christ I'm pretty sure that goes for that if not that's Dale quote do what you're going to but listen Church my point is we're looking at each other trying to judge whether that person is what they think they are but you know what they're looking at you you know that old song years ago I'm looking back to see if he's looking back to see is he listen Church I believe the Prophet brought the message but people don't want me to quote these quotes you know that brethren said the bride must vindicate Malachi 4 luke 1730 what do you mean you don't believe God's indicator Eve indicated to man yes he did but somebody's got to vindicate his message he vindicated a man and he would stand and say if I preached the truth you come and show me and show you that's right God will come down and heal the sick and he done it right and yet he was preaching the white horse rider what does the Holy Ghost you see we don't get into that do we we don't want to talk like that cuz you making him just a human being no no that's what he was but I've got it it's in one of these notes in here Malachi 4 was a predestinated seed I said exactly what I meant go that's what he say it it's to see the country yes in 80 turn Malachi 4 was predestinated eternally the man that have come through was predestinated by foreknowledge to bring the word but the seed he wrought was he predestinated eternally Missy then if that's right then ever word in God's Bible is predestinated for somebody to live it somebody to make it alive somebody to make it manifest look what he says on there where we stopped this morning turn on the lights priests in 64 it meets that condition every time that God manifest is liked the word itself once the world scuse me itself rejects that light why it's written in the Bible he's aged God has allotted so much of his word for each age and he always sends somebody to manifest that word he lauded it for the age he predestinated it before the world it was predestinated eternally from God the day would be a day when Martin Luther would protest the Catholic Church I go to that because that's where people don't like me to go it's ok we go to Paul or Peter something they don't like for you to hang on to those signs there's a man here that can turn on the light 65 and all ages God has set for so much of his word for each age God always sends somebody that that word can get into and show the light of that ever age it does the same thing always does that a predestinated word Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 that's why you heard no no writers Pauline him didn't even write of son of man I don't want to wrote about it was the Apostles that wrote in their day of what Jesus said son of man show me in the Bible or fouling him wrote about son of man no they didn't get that did they didn't bring it out because they didn't get it it was not the age but here comes a prophet even back in the forties and fifties speaking of the son of man he said the Son of Man is the Word made flesh well I've read about know the Son of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ now watch what he says here on prices identified 64 so in each age when God locks his word for each age now what's his order then when that word is ready to be manifested let's search the scriptures don't just take my word when that word is ready to be manifested then God sends down a prophet and reveals the word to his prophet are you getting it God was ready in the days of Martin Luther a man drops down it's a burden his heart and God uses him to bring a message moved on with John Wesley moved on to Azusa Street moved on to the end time prophet right did you read what our listen to what I'm reading when that word is ready to be manifested he quotes that twiced then God sends a prophet to do what and when the word is ready to be made manifest he's sent a prophet to bring the word come on we can't get it without that when God is ready for something to happen the Prophet came on the scene are you listening ninis word can be made manifest through him now we're gonna get on down here little fighter where there's got to be somebody then make that manifest oh it's brother branham's manifestation I'm not dumb about the gifts the signs and wonder what was the manifestation to show he was a prophet the word that he brought not two signs and wonders go Satan can impersonate not gifts etc it's whether or not he stays with the word a properties not judged by signs signs always come with a profit but they follow false ones too when I started studying this message brother moment was telling me about he said I've seen the dead raised I've seen this thick heel I said brother mo I said I believe you I don't believe you liked him ago then don't eat up I said you tell me what the man talked I'll know whether he was a prophet or not that was the words I told him you know why cuz he come out with the same things cuz I've already read a little bit what run around and said you know and he says if it comes out with the same old message and don't matter signs and wonder fathers it I serve words you did that quote you know matter signs in the earth followers these people that run off I told you the same time I told you many years ago that I'd read where the prophet said these things would take place I told you I said it'll come a day when the two souls seventh under verse approves etc all those doctors will be having signs and wonders and they will say we are of God cause look what is taking place but if they don't stay with a word right I can't trust anything else little run said Satan can pass out supernatural gifts now you want to argue with brother branham but he can't stay with that word that's the one thing he can't do he'll take so much of it sure he said enough to make it work but he won't stay with the word just keep quoting it to him you get talking somebody you know and they really laying down time till you just start talking about the word right Lulla eyes like these girls went to camp one time and they were talking from here and this person came up said I know where you went to church or go to church said you go to little Georgia you know what because they was quoting some things that we talked right just speak the word the devil can't stand out now so when the word is ready to be made manifest god it is mine looks down see the ages the times he sends a prophet to bring the word all right same message paragraph 123 tries to identify the same in all generations when Jesus come he was the word so was Moses the word Moses the rest of the prophets was the word but they were the word in portion P ort eilean as you miss my southern language they don't mean potion portion look they were the word in Porsche he was the word in food he was a fullness of the word he was the word who's that speaking up it's a Porsche another word for each age and how does he make it known he makes it known by servants the prophets if you don't understand where I put all the emphasis then you're blind anyway don't forget it you don't brew light up with all the images on everything that I've ever taught is to come right out of the message listen the message presume in 1962 but that predestinated Word of God laying out younger will bring that predestinated one I'm reading what he says but that predestinated Word of God laying out yonder will bring that predestinated one when he speaks he will come to the earth to the glory under helloo you know under job said I will restore when the predestinated word of god laying out younger will bring that predestinated one that'll bring God among us are you listening mm-hmm restoration to the bride tree 1962 paragraph 170 but the birth the new Burke that comes by Christ cannot die that's one tree and the other tree remember he talks about the two trees do that and this tree though it's been persecuted made fun of us since the very beginning of the Garden of Eden it cannot die its predestinated it's been clubbed and beat and my everything done to it and what happened it cannot die he is he will not die he can't because he's holding in him the predestinated Word of God it has to come forth for us his fruit in his season predestinated season Luther had the message predestinated season Wesley had the message predestinated season for there our the Prophet had the message predestinated CD now you and I have got to give birth to that seat right come on proving his word 1964 how does he make his word known to the people first God knowing that there would be unbelievers and watch the wisdom of God knowing that there would be unbelievers and how the majority would be unbelievers he by foreknowledge predestinated a seed forever age that would believe it predestinated a seed that would believe it what by foreknowledge he said he by foreknowledge right predestinated a seed forever age that would believe it I believe in predestination folks I believe in the seed of God being predestinated eternally I believe people come by for knowledge then when you put the foreknowledge and the pre determining together you can't separate the people from the word come on and if you'll notice in there for each age goes right on with his word everything right on time nothing hinders God he goes right on and every click is moving just exactly right we think sometimes it's not going to work right but don't you worry his clock is time just exactly to the split instant and everything's working just exactly right well brother that letters don't understand how come we're down here I hear preachers I've been in sit with them they'll have to bite my tongue sit with him then say everybody here believed it we're gonna be out of here by 77 have you heard that everybody but brother I a priest in 74 that we could past year 2026 everybody in here you know what that means I'm nobody I got it I'm predestinated seed paragraph 54 it's the rising of the Sun don't fear anymore wherever foreordained predestinated seed of God she'll come to life when the light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordained it to he has raised from the dead see because he not only seems his word he seems his Holy Spirit too quickly because he goes on talks about what is quick made alive now let's see if you can believe this paragraph 4:15 restoration in the bride 362 but what he was God's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory I want to say something directly if he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it that's what he asked now do you believe it they said Amen from the Garden of Eden because he was a seed of the woman right then the bridegroom tree without the female don't buy fruit so he's got to have a bride tree she has got to be borned other same material the Word made flesh in the tree hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride same word he was the Word made flesh Doug listen to what I'm talking about a code I keep referring back where you remember it Luke there was the Word made flesh for his age you know the Lutheran the Methodist the Pentecostals the Prophet in our day but what about me and you when we just sitting around waiting on the bus goes but we you know we can't find ourselves these two the trumpets preached in 1964 paragraph 115 but it will come that is his promise for this age we're living in the age that his coming will be in she must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband brother 2 or 1 and Christ bride had to be identified with him for the two or one and he is a word not to denomination the word we are to be the children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do you know light except it comes from the word all right then we're still reading you might want to write that down these two the trumpets to be 64 719 the morning service paragraph 115 no he talks about the children of the light and the light is a word which is made life for this age how do we know light except it comes from the work all right the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it and the Bible said so the word made flesh is the light of the age why can't we say the bride is the word made flesh and it's with the lights from the rising of the Sun 65 4:18 prayer at 168 that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh it was flesh in that day by the Sun the groom it's the flesh today by the bride its flesh today so when it says you remember I told you this morning John 1:14 1 1 1 through 14 says he's the word and he created all things then it says the Prophet comes to introduce a lot of the age that the Prophet is not the light but he's the one to introduce then he comes down and says but that will make us sons and daughters of the Living God verse 13 and then he says and the word was made flesh sure the word is gonna have to be made flesh by somebody why can't we believe with him brother Branham said you Pentecostals if you won't go God will raise up Baptist and Methodist Mao said this one God raised up blue lights Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholics ain't no telling what else is sitting in here today the Pentecostals rejected it right but the little bride says be it unto me according to thy word but around sin spoken words regional seat he said when she says that I mean we quote that ten thousand times so did Luke there ten thousand times of the Jesse lived my faith one day it was sparked alive he said when the bride begins to say I'm my father one we can say that ten thousand times but when it's revealed he says when the bride says be it unto me according to thy word he said sparks will fly my sin smoking words of reason Oh see sparks will fly when somebody begins to say I and my father are one and he said let me quote it with it and these other things get that quote and look at that he said in these other things what when the bride B begins to be the word and believe she is the word Satan was gonna get mad at her well brother Dale don't preach it he won't get mad at us then let me just say it plain language shut the doors we ain't the predestinated see it was a predestinated seed don't say that the predestinated seed was one in Mary that said be it unto me according to thy word predestinated seed in the little woman at the whales says we know when the Messiah coming you'll do these time faith always comes by hearing and hearing by the word a predestinated chosen seed of God waiting on the church to be able to say that's me what about Jesus you think he didn't have to go that away what about it in Luke one then he was quoting Isaiah 62 the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to bring he said this day this scripture is fulfilled you know what that was the day it was quickened to him what he was doing you know what I didn't mean it you know what he would do it it was quickened to him that he was Isaiah when he spoke up when you and I get to the flesh one of these days do we quit thinking about our own selves and what we are and what we got this that or the other or whatever and start realizing what God has said about us let me at least say what he said I said that in the 60s now I'm saying it today let me say what he said if I can't make it manifest let somebody pick that up and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord and be that then I've done my job I pray that you understand what I'm trying to bring I'm trying to talk about you not me that's why the people couldn't understand come on music they couldn't understand brother Branham knows even the haters thought he were talking about his own self even though their own saying he said I'm just the one that's spire to be used for the time yes don't mean the man had seen the dead raised to stick healed and everything that could be taking place and he'd say don't make nothing out of me there's all him now do you see why I said this morning it's 100% God the Bible is but our people that received the Word of God and have made manifest the god that we talk about in the day they were living so why can't we start saying what he said you know he got over to see the book before he started making this statement he said I call you bride right I called you bride but then when you get over the revelation that said his wife has made herself ready more than just a bride somebody's got to be down you want a picture of how beautiful you are read revelations 21 and 22 John describes a city describes a bride he can't get things straightened out he just he just telling it and he looks at one he sees the other look see this wonderful right say Amen Jonas let's stand together think on these things the Word made flesh is the light of the age hey what we done anybody having a diol doors open Lizzy he's the word who are we the work let me read masterpiece or listen to the tape you

about it you've got plenty of time to do everything else and read love story magazines and all kind of junk no time to listen to the Prophet and yet you say you're the word quit being a hypocrite get in or get out shailen you know why cause it's dangerous to hang around the bride but when she begins to really be what the prophet said she is Sheikh is gonna come after her no brother Dale I don't believe that I believe is going out here on the fly man of each yeah you keep on blending like that it go me a lot of us in the flowerbed of he that nursing home Oleg is running out of this folks I

eternal life and not eternal life is a great product you know what if you have eternal life then there's no way you can turn down the Word of God you know one with eternal life can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost what took your Luther when he was drinking and pub and smoking a pot what took care of him when he was in the Jews were to be took on killed because of crucifying Christ God had to wink in his ignorance how many of you and I as he winked at her ignorance in the time space when we laughed at the word and the time made light of people but a true genuine sea came blasphemy altogether
