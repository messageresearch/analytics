all things will be made well we love you and we thank you bless the little bride around the world as she endeavors for you bless those that are not here because of sicknesses and things lord and just touch each one we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen okay luke 11 starting with 29. now watch i want to use these two scriptures they're saying the same thing but i want you to pick up how it's handled and what is is going with it and you'll see it all tied together and when the people were gathered to get thick together he began to say now this is jesus speaking to the people the multitude all right this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet whereas jonas was assigned unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation all right now watch the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and the greater than solomon is here and the men of nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here okay now just watch the point now and listen to what said go to matthew now 12 38. the insertion of the pharisees or excuse me certain of the scribes and the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee and he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a son there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now i want to just take a thought you know and talk about a little bit about tying this the son of man the jonas and the thing because you know you uh these in arguments always has been arguments about the uh when it would be three days and three nights and and all of the heart of the earth and and the things like that that would be and uh you know they've argued over that point all the way down through time but the scripture is plain in stating it that the prophet jonas all right and it describes that jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly all right now then it said and so how shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth all right so then there's no problem of understanding if we just look at it with simple sense and ideas or thoughts and see that jonas would be three days and three nights and and the son of man would be three days and three nights all right and see like i said the argument has been that he was crucified here and resurrected here and he'd done this and then the other and they try to put together all of the things but just think about it it's not dealing necessarily with three days you know they're there jonas was in the whale's belly for three days all right jesus was in the heart of the earth or that part in the the doing of the of of his part of the son of man and for three days and three nights like i said then you argue this and you argue that well why argue think about what it's talking about all right now jonas was in the whale's belly for three days or three nights all right and then he raised come out all right the lord jesus christ was three days and three nights and then he came out of the grave all right so then it's not to argue how many days of what this is well that's three days they want to say he was crucified thursday friday saturday sunday hung around come up sunday morning and this that the other the arguments backwards and forth but why talk about that why not think about what is being said what was jonas all right the three days and the three nights of jonas was the sign of the resurrection and that's what they asked they asked about the resurrection you know the sign give us a sign they said all right i'll give you the sign jonas was the sign of the resurrection not necessarily had to be three days three nights that's fine that's you you don't get the point don't don't uh put it all out but think about it you're talking about the resurrection instead of three days and three nights because that's what he's dealing with jonas jonas raised he come out all right resurrection all right see the lord jesus was crucified put in and came out resurrection all right now jonas being the sign of the resurrection they now keep that thought in your mind jonas would be the sign of the resurrection all right then the lord jesus christ the son of man would be the sign of the resurrection in his part now listen to what i'm saying so then who is this son of man amen he said well the art the christ the son of the living god you know all right we got many you could go through many many lengthy ways of approaching and talking about but remember the son of man jonas was a tight right for the resurrection the son of man was the type of the resurrection all right now who is this son of man he's a resurrection amen okay keep it to the simple point of thinking about it see jesus was the same as jonas don't argue about trying to figure out what this day is what that day is think about what it means jonas was assigned to the the people at nineveh all right a sign of the resurrection okay sign of the resurrection jesus was the son of man he was three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and then he raised up the sign of the resurrection all right now remember the son of the remember jonas now get what i'm saying jonas is a sign of the resurrection jesus is a sign of the resurrection all right that's it there's no need new arguing over this we firm believer we know what it is because if you take it and put it in there correctly you'll come out to the right dates anyway that jesus was crucified on friday afternoon resurrected early sunday morning making three days and three nights all right you can fuss about that but the main thing is i want you to talk about or to us to think about resurrection resurrection forgive me coughing gets me in this time of the year all right now to the ninevites they saw a man walk out right out of the whale's belly all right which would be the sign of the resurrection the lord jesus christ walked out of the tomb the the sign of the resurrection all right now who is this son of man then he's the sign of the resurrection and once you get that where we'll continue on the thought excuse me the son of man is the sign of the resurrection all right now do you believe that amen because that's what he was he was that let's go into scripture and see if that's true all right go ahead with number one on your notes which would be from john and let's look at this for a minute let's think about this resurrection because my main point is to get you to see one thing jesus when he says this watch he says i am the resurrection who's the resurrection the i am amen right the i am is the resurrection sign that's what i want you to get because you can argue about what dates and times and seasons all day long it won't get you nowhere but get what the son of man is because this is the day when the son of man was to be revealed it's the day you and i are living in well what are you looking for the son of man to be revealed i'm looking for a resurrection amen that's right yes sir resurrection comes before rapture wade preached another night honestly resurrection comes before rapture all right and see that resurrection then it's got to be in this day in this hour that we're living that's right so then look what happened in this day here comes a prophet right which would be to you and i uh uh revealing of the word made known into our heart in love the sign or resurrection sign this prophet had the resurrection signed now watch what i'm talking about it wasn't necessarily totally just the gifts and signs and wonders that's part of it but he was bringing us the word now the word is the resurrection amen come on the word is the resurrection because see we got to be raised out of history amen raised from denominationalism and raising it all there and to do that then we must follow into the resurrection so look what happened here and many of the jews john 11 and many of the jews come to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother because you know what had happened lazarus had died jesus was away he kept going on the way further away you know and then he finally turned and come back now when he comes back then martha and mary's demeaning him and he's concerned but get what he's doing then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming when he met him but mary set steel in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if the highest been here my brother had not died now look at her her point but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee all right she made her commitment she believes that whatever he says is going to do it whatever happens going to be all right now watch jesus answered unto her thy brother shall rise again all right there was an argument among the pharisees and the sadducees basically the point is that the sadducees didn't believe in a uh a complete resurrection like the pharisees believed in it you know they kind of had an argument backwards and forth now don't get me wrong and take it in the wrong direction the the sadducees we've made fun of them you know because we said well they were the sad you see because they didn't believe in the resurrection but now they did right they believed in the resurrection but they didn't believe it like the pharisees the pharisees had their concept to the resurrection the sadducees had their concept of it all right it's not if they didn't believe in the resurrection gets a point not if they didn't believe in the resurrection they believed in it but they didn't have it in the correct way so we'd say that more or less the sadducees would have a little different point and and would be doubting uh things to happen in a certain way whereas the pharisees had it figured out that it's going to take place this this is going to take place and it'll be a a resurrection all right but look jesus said and heard thy brother shall rise again because basically everybody believes that's what i said if that come down see you may have picked up that doctrine through the issues in your denominationalism because in the baptist they did they believed basically that you had their sadducees was sad because they didn't believe in the resurrection pharisees was happy because they were you know they were where they believed in it but both of them believed in the resurrection it's just the way they were looking at it see now watch what happened to under give you understanding what happened with with job the job said i know he come to a position or a place that he said i know my redeemer liveth all right see he was looking at the resurrection job was looking at the resurrection because he said i know my redeemer liveth and in the last days he'll appear amen amen well all right now follow the point then martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last days see now what was she looking forward to she wasn't looking listen she wasn't looking at a point that he would raise right there but yet she made her commitment that whatever you do or say it will it will take place but yet her her whole anchor was based upon just that point that whatever he would say and she didn't see the resurrection standing there come on jesus saith unto her i am the resurrection who is the resurrection the i am who's the i am amen the lord jesus christ the son of man the god of glory he was describing to her he said she was looking and said sure sure my brother arrives in the resurrection job see in his early part of his life that's what he had sure sure one of these days is going to be because he was very smart very intelligent but then one day something wrong a bell in the man's life and he said i know my redeemer liveth that he's here right now but look at what was already taking place he was losing his wife i mean his kids he was losing his cattle he was losing his way we're talking about a while ago what was taking place all of that was going on yeah but he said his mind for one time amen he said i know my redeemer does now that word know there is not to just say i know because you can say i know and you're just guessing you know you're just guessing what's taking place but if you really know and job had reached that point see that he knowed that there was going to be a resurrection all right now do you believe that are you set on that do you know there's going to be a resurrection because see we we're not dealing with whether or not it's three days or four hours or six hours or whatever everybody's arguing about you know what happens in the resurrection and she said i know that if you'd have been here my brother wouldn't have died what's that even now i believe that whatever you say that'll be it now watch him anchor it then what did he say jesus saith unto her i am the resurrection she was looking for a resurrection of lazarus right that's what she wanted and she believed that whatever he would say would take place and he said i am the resurrection see now listen this is something that's going to strike some and and some it'll ring a good bell but listen see the i am is the resurrection the i am is the son of man amen the son of man is the resurrection sign the sign of the son of man the scripture we'll call it we may not get that far but if we don't we'll pick it up later even in the last day see that's what it's to be brother branham had the resurrection signed amen come on the dead was raised sick was healed of all things but he had the sign of the resurrection because he was known to be the son of man who demands say i the son of man i am. now come on we know the story brother random's not the son of man come on don't go to sleep on me on that way just keep it in the right order get it like martha got it get what you got because when it finished up she saith unto him yay lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world she's saying to act to him i believe you are the christ because listen what he's saying to her see jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us out of this do you believe that see he's asking her does she believe him i'm asking you do we believe him amen see we're in a special age a special time a special part we're not like in the church ages that is coming down that would be the son of god right son of god through the seven church ages but in the last church ages to come back to be the son of man amen that's right amen not brother branham as a god or son of man it's the son of man the word larry stewart she said if you'd have just you know if you'd have just been here so i believe you i've walked with you all of these years i've believed what you taught he said yeah but do you see one thing he says you're looking for a resurrection that's what she was desiring right but he said i'm not looking for a resurrection he said i am the resurrection he said i'm the resurrection itself if you believe these things amen the resurrection of life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live come on and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us out of this see we're in the days of the son of man right when the day when the son of man would be revealed that's right we can go on over because it takes it on through into the scriptures and go on later we'll pick it up to go on into uh you know after we get out of here after we leave out of here the great sign of the son of man will appear back on earth again right but hey folks we've already had the sign of the son of man that's not brother around being god no it's the sign of the son of man because it's the resurrection sign come on do you believe that it's the resurrection sign i'm i'm sorry for saying things in the wrong way maybe listen when i was the baptist we talked about jesus being the resurrection we didn't understand the son of man we didn't understand the coming forth into the last days it would happen and be that way because we didn't have it in our comprehension it had never been taught to us but we talked about it i remember some ministers meetings and the things after coming on into the message we were having a minister's meeting in a place and and somebody struck out on the resurrection i just asked him i said the son of man's resurrection i said that's the resurrection sign brother branham had the resurrection sign nobody could do as he said what did he say bring me 15 of your worst cases and i'll guarantee you healing for every one of them whereas anybody could say that the only there was the one that could say it was the son of man dwelling in a son of man making manifest the word of god do you understand i remember that day when i was talking like this yesterday and somebody i said don't y'all understand i said brother branham had the resurrection sign amen said he had the resurrection sign in his life death was called forth challenged and defeated because he could say not him himself but he could say the ministry that i have to you is the resurrection you realize how wonderful that is to think about it we're not in the days of the son of god when he would would be dealing with that in the church ages we're in the age of the son of man there is your son of man coming forth which is malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. all of those scriptures coming forth he could say if you believe if you believe the prophet could say it amen if you believe all right let's pick up a little bit and read something but you understand jesus said to her he said she said to him if you'd have just been here but yet still i believe you he said all right he said let's see if you believe this he said i am the resurrection the i am is the almighty god not the prophet of god the i am is almighty god in human flesh see why look for the resurrection when we have the resurrection among us right go ahead at number two brothers and just pick up a few of these thoughts just let the prophet answer it in a way from the message greater than solomon is here i didn't want to start preaching i said in this meeting i was going to stand here and talk about divine healing all right let's go back in in horror a wicked and an adult and excuse me divine heal all right let's go back to all right a wicked and an adulterous generation seeketh after us after signs they will receive the sign listen now it doesn't mean they will receive the sign it means the sign will come to them they don't receive it because their denominations ain't going to receive the sign of the son of man only the born-again believers of this message can receive the sign of the son of man are you with me that's how straight i am about it only the born-again believer can come forth to understand only the born-again believer can see that jesus could stand there and say i am the resurrection and the life if you just believe it so listen a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after signs and they will receive the sign the son of jonas now watch it now jonas laid in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so much the son of man lay in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights then listen bring it to yourself it may be a little light on the scripture it may be something but it's in the scripture the sign of jonas would be the sign of the resurrection maybe when i started while ago you wouldn't fall in that right we'll follow it now the sign of jonas would be the sign of the resurrection he was in the heart of the earth three days and three nights and he resurrected all right the wicked and adulterous generation that's seeking a sign will get a sign of the resurrection now take it to our day in our time some of you were there and saw the sign of the son of man you saw actually the life the things of sign of the son of man what was that god dealing through a prophet to try to bring us the word because son of man then would go and you get your your concordance and run it through and check how many times in the old testament that it speaks of the son of man what was the son of man word to the people right come on look at number three the third exodus so that's so that's the way it is again today god is calling his elect people and they are elected now and now they are elected for what what are you elected for he said you're elected for a resurrection right and what kind of a sign is he showing them what kind of a sign come to this last day generation who was it the man that they preached the funeral and he said we've seen god walk among us the sign of the son of man amen the resurrection sign god is calling his elected people they're elected now and then and they're elected for what for a resurrection and what kind of a sign is he showing them resurrection sign what was he showing them then a delivering sign to deliver them from the bondage a sign of power that would shut the heavens or could black the skies and now he's showing this power of the resurrection of his son living among them to resurrect them from the grave and graveyard that we're living in that we're in to the land that he's promised to us resurrection sign calling out of spiritual egypt in babylon resurrection sign how happy you and i should be amen to consider the fact that we've had an opportunity and i said some of you were there well it was taking place you saw the dead raised you saw the sick healed you saw the word being revealed well shouldn't we be to the place basis then of saying at least like martha lord if you'd have just been here my brother wouldn't have died she said i believe this i believe it i believe yeah there'll be a resurrection yes he's going to raise one of these days after 4 000 years 6 000 years or so he's going to raise but he said listen what are you looking so far off why are you trying to figure it out i said you're not doing no more than an argument of whether it was three days four days or whatever you understand that was split among the denominations of whether jesus was crucified one of them says that he was crucified on thursday and then had to go and had to hang around raised late saturday afternoon and had that to make it fit and had to come forth and and be able to be raised on you know fourth and appeared on sunday morning we see your prophet come in said he was crucified on friday now do you believe it he was crucified on friday and the bible said he was raised early the first day of the week he didn't have to hang around he was busy he was down in hell getting all of that taken care of and bumping the devil around and doing all the things and showing amen and then he come forth in the resurrection what about you and me we could at least be like mary that would say yes lord i believe if you would just have been here but even now i still have an understanding of you that if you'll just call for it he said i don't have to call he said i'm the resurrection myself said if you just believe that right that's right everything would be taken care of all your sicknesses heart acts and troubles are taken care of if you can believe that you you can stand and believe and say that he is the resurrection amen and that prophet brought this word unto us the sign of the son of man the sign of the resurrection is what i'm getting at he had the sign of the son of man right that's right because he could call forth and the dead was raised sick healed sign of the son of man that's the resurrection sign that's the sign we all need it's to realize what's taking place go ahead to the next one what kind of a sign would a wicked and an adulterous generation find out the resurrection sign and that's what we are promised today the resurrection sign that he is still alive he is the same yesterday today and forever he said as it was in the days of lot as we went through it last night in the days of lot what happened in the days of lot so would it be at the coming of the son of man these things we are promised many more scriptures to keep from taking you know taking up time a little while in the world see it won't see me no more cosmos because what is over he's the same yesterday today and forever you and i should be the happiest people to ever be thought of because we've seen even though i didn't was not there so i said some of you were there the bible says you know talking about and says and some are still alive among us there's some still sitting here today alive among us that saw these things you saw the sign of the son of man but come on what did you see the resurrection amen he said what is who is this son of man in the beginning was the word word is with god and the word was god that's what your prophet said a sign of the son of man amen god living among mankind go ahead to the nation voice of the signs look jonah the prophet look at that sign he was on his road to sarcasm started to go to nineveh and took a road to tarsus many condemned jonah and jonah don't deserve to be condemned he was a prophet the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord jump on down then what notice he said as jonah was in the valley of the whale three days and three nights it was to be a sign so must the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights and a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall be no sign given them from god now do you follow what i'm saying while ago it's for them but they won't receive it they won't accept it it's coming from god come on there shall be no sign given them from god remember but the sign of jonas what is jonah's sign the resurrection and this is that sodom generation adulterous spiritual adultery and all what they'll get it amen the sign of the resurrection see people are not listening to do you realize what's going to happen very quickly you realize that time is running out you realize something's got to take place i'm not a doomsday preacher never been that i've always preached but i've always preached to you a not a future thing or a past thing i've always preached to you but present tense because to me the present tense is the resurrection when he said i am the resurrection he would stand in our present tense he wasn't talking to the future or what had happened with with lazarus the sign of the son of man is the resurrection sign okay continue on fourth of the sign the next one excuse me identification but now what somebody of us says could jesus be in birmingham then tonight yes sir they promised he would how would he be here in the form of what the holy spirit that's what he is saying yesterday today and forever he's in the form of the holy spirit now i wish i had time to inject one more thought here but i probably won't but let me get it it's just quick will you you suffer women for a few minutes i don't want to keep you too late and miss your buses listen jesus said in saint luke the 16th chapter or 17th chapter as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man did he say that congregation what what right along in there he was reading the same bible watch watch the setting of lot and what a sinful nation it was what a sinful what a sinful place look what we're in today look what did he say a sinful generation is going to seek after signs and wonder what are they going to get save time's reading roll it up look son of man the resurrection sign this adulterous generation would receive the resurrection sign but brother branham you're saying they're going to receive it not receive it as a for themselves but the little bride will receive it for herself thank god for the resurrection sign in this last days the resurrection sign it's coming forth some still here that was there when he was here and saw the great things some are now saying it won't be long i'm not a doomsday i'm not a a a person that just throws out all these things but listen son of man the resurrection signed this adulterous generation would receive it they won't receive it as a redemptive get what he's saying they don't receive it as a redemptive form they receive it as the basis that they were glad to hear to have the prophet among them they were glad to have the lord jesus among them when he was walking on the shores of galilee feeding the sick you know healing the sick feeding the people and doing all the things they were glad to have there but yet they didn't go on with it amen do you understand what he's saying this end time is to receive the resurrection sign but they won't take it you think they're going to turn down their churches and things and take this message of the hour no no they won't do it why because they're they're not set for that but the bride is amen right let's keep saying at least we could be like martha to say lord i know even now that whatever you say well you know i've preached for 50 years and my whole thought for the 50 years that i've been preaching has been one thing because your prophetess once said it that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man now how many more services do you need on that that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man the lord jesus christ upon earth in human flesh again there's your resurrection there's the sign that i'm looking for it's for me and you to come to a basis that we can believe it and stand on it and then no matter what takes place we just okay let me be like martha let me at least say well lord i can believe you the sign of the resurrection is given to the church in the last days pull that one up number six queen of sheba all right drop down about the middle but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection sign is given to the church in this last days the angel of the holy spirit in the meet in the meetings showing the same thing doing the same thing across the country across the nation proving that jesus christ has raised from the dead just the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that will receive it who those who believe it those who believe it those who can accept that this end time message was the resurrection message come on the opening of the word is the resurrection message are you following me trying to get it to a life's point the resurrection sign is the sign of the son of man the sign of the son of man is the word revealed in human flesh dwelling in a bride running in you never but do you believe it well i i i've never heard it maybe i've never never considered the thoughts or what kind of a sign would this wicked and adulterous generation the sign of the son of man that's what we find now christ alive among us the sign of the resurrection amen what do we need anything else yeah but if i just seen it if i just seen that i'd believe it believe what as i keep saying at least we could say martha martha says lord i believe i believe what you're saying well can we take the message the prophet's message and say lord i believe it amen because that is the resurrection message what is that he lives now come on what is the resurrection we're finishing up musicians come on what is it jesus standing there raised from the dead standing among the people the great i am the lord jesus christ and saying i am the resurrection and the life we don't have to look for something that's already here the prophet's message has brought us to these things when are we going to believe it that way what kind of a sign the sign of the resurrection do you believe do you believe the sick has been healed among us do you believe the dead has been raised i'm talking about hearing lulu a lot of you are sitting here today because if you believe the word of god and god come down and heal you right the resurrection sign is here the sign of the son of man what is the sound of the son of man i am the resurrection and the life the word is the son of man do you follow me the revealed word is the sign of the son of man you realize when you're studying this prophet's message and reading what he says that's the sign of the son of man but do we believe it so finish it up with one thing the son of man is the resurrection sign the prophet of god had that resurrection signed he was not the son of man no the lord jesus christ as the son of man but he was a son of man that the son of man could come down and live in and speak out and call for the dead to be raised the sick to be healed all manner of things and say i am the resurrection can you believe it can you believe that the resurrection is inside of you was that what the prophet said that's right that is in us in your spirit it's in you amen resurrection let's stand think on
