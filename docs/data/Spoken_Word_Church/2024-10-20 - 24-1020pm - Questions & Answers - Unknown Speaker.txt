========================================

[Music] hey man let's all stand our feet um thank you all for coming I didn't figure this many people be back we got two extra questions so try to answer them too all right let's go to the Lord in prayer um I tell you what brother Boyd how about open a word prayer for the for the service thank you Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord that's right amen you can be seated we'll get right in to the U to the questions um they'll pull them up on the board like I said I've had a couple of these before and I wanted to get the this one right here is a really good one you know sometimes is U and if you ever if you want me to stop ask question it's totally informal okay and um but I hope you didn't bring you popcorn and your drink like we usually do downstairs or or your knitting needle but we always make this statement and we make statements as a as a church and as a a Ministry I say the the message we make statements like that she is him she is him and we shout and we praise the Lord and we but do we really understand what ises brother Ram mean when he says she's him so we're going to cover that one and then there's a few other ones I think I have four on here and then I have two here so oh I think I have five um but we're going to start with this one because it was the first one uh the oldest one but what does brother randam mean when he said she is him all right well now we know one thing for sure get it out of your mind we are not God himself right cuz that's who the HM is the H is Jesus Christ right we cannot ever be Jesus Christ we're mes Jesus Christ but now remember as we'll go through here in a minute as Adam and Eve were literally in one body all right they were literally in one body now us sitting here as husband and wife we we've never been in come out of the same body but Adam and Eve did come out of the same substance same body so in tight we can go back and get into the side of our Adam spirit Adam and we can get in there and become one with him but we'll never be The Headstone we're headstone people so I want you to understand when brother BR says she is him now if you take that literally then you would think well she is just exact no she is him in potential she is him in attribute she acts like him but he's always the head listen we've got one headship and that's Christ amen he was eternal before we were I'm sorry I know we were in the mind of God and all that but I'm talking about sitting here today he was eternal he would never had a bad thought never never anything entered his mind he knew what was going to happen he knew from his very mind what was going to take place and he knew then he would give us an opportunity to come back to where because remember we're going to read this in a minute when you go back across the chasm back into the Garden of Eden she is him right all right she is him same DNA and everything their bodies were exactly the same you know what I mean man and woman but they were of the same Source all right but when sin happened and it separated that we can never because I'll read it to you in a minute remember in the Garden of Eden before the fall they were coal she is him right but now after the fall God said no for now on you got to have a head you've got to be the woman woman's got to have headship just like Christ is our head so don't get it in your mind that we're going to totally morph into him all right because we can't ever be that Eternal person that never sinned listen we got that inside of us that's what we're working toward right but in your state of what you're in right now in the state of we're that we're in when brother M said she is him we'll read some of the things that he said to help us with that all right so the question is what does he mean when he says she is him all right we know we're going back to the Garden of Eden but when that when the fall happened God in Genesis 3:15 he said I'm going to put enmity there's going to be a division between me and you now and as Adam will now be your head Eve I I'm going to be the head of Adam or the head of the church or the head of the bride all right and I want you to understand that as close as we get to him because we are going to be the son of man in the end time but not as one person every person in here's got a piece of that in their being called Soul called The Genesis 126 man all right is everybody with me so we can't be literally him because of the sin curse because of the Fall because of that and I was thinking the other day this sin curse is so bad that what's inside of you by the new birth is as Eternal as God is never had a beginning never had an end and will never die right but if you're flesh dies it dies that thing pulls apart and goes somewhere else that's how that's how bad Sin was in the garden that's how bad that thing was it wasn't just you know Adam had or Eve had a relationship with the Beast and no it was a lot more than that it totally separated us from coming the way we should have come right it totally separated us from God you hear me so bad till God can't even see us now brother Brown said he only sees the bumper blood and he hears your voice up through it amen because this thing is judged as we were talking this morning we're going to look at it a little bit more on because talking about the the two judgments if you're in Christ you're already judged in your soul this is not because remember there's two judgments I'm getting ahead of myself there's another judgment we got to go to to do the to to to have the Deeds Done in your body whether good or bad now your soul can never be bad if it's born again right so that's where you have you two judgments and Paul's real clear on that we'll cover that a little bit later on but don't get in your mind that we are exactly sure we're the same Source same substance brother Ram tells us that over and over and over again but just remember don't walk around and say I'm God now we can say that if you know what you're talking about it takes maturity to know this right here he didn't say this in 1957 he said this in 60 something rising of the sun I believe it is 64 65 he had to come to a place to where he knew what he was talking about but then maybe it trips us up to think that we're going to be we are the greatest thing that ever hit the face of this earth besides Jesus Christ we are you're sitting here today with something that no one else has in the world but I don't want you to sit there and go well I've got it all and they they're all dying and going to hell no we're going to talk about judgment in a little while too all right but let's read this right here real quick and get through I always say we're going to have plenty of time but we may not now here's brother Bram the rising of the sun this is is the quote as he being the groom the bride has to come forth CU it's a part of him now remember the bride the bride that God's looking at is the Eternal part of him everybody with me God's going to Rapture a bride that is changed resurrected changed and In His Image all right that be with me right but he still the bridegroom where the bride but we got to make oursel ready so that we can meet him and be able to what have his potentials and do all the things that that brother R tells us because what happens now in the world if you tell somebody you're the bride of Christ they're going to look at you crosseyed cuz they're all we can't do it we ain't we're none of us perfect you've heard it come on well you think you're perfect cuz you go to church and you no I ain't perfect cuz I go to church I'm perfect cuz I accepted something that was perfect right right I accept I didn't come here with something that perfect I accepted something that was perfect so I put all my perfection in him it all goes back to what the bridegroom but the that's why the church is separate the church doesn't know what we're talking about right sorry they don't the church I'm talking about the nominal church just calls you crazy but you know what they call Jesus crazy too right when he said I and my father are one now as being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it can only be the manifestation not the person the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations now look it's got to take all the revelations for you to see this Foundation don't see this that well you just have to quote it but we're going to become it it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and any others has spoke of the Bride so everything's got to culminate in you and me it can only manifest if it this some does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life is of his life power of his power she is him now watch he goes back to the Garden as man and woman are one and women take woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics right so that's us but we're not again don't ever think that you're the groom you're the bride you're some we are submissive to somebody and I we're going to talk about judgment judgment is absolutely a part of a Christian Life you know you got scripture says would not be judging no one the Bible says we'll judge the whole world okay even the angels we will judge them but listen we got to listen to what God told me that's what he was going to do God told us in the Bible this is what he's going to give it to us right so if he does he's going to give it to us he's not going to want it back he's going to give it to us he's going to give us that power but we are not him and hold of one everybody with me we're a many membered body yes we're we're part of Christ but we're still submissive to a headship if not then we're in bad trouble but I believe the bride in this end time I just believe this we know who our husband is and then what we're going to do is is what we're going to do brother Anderson is we're going to believe what my bridegroom says about me I'm going to believe what he says about me now whether I manifest it it's my business but he said if you'll do these things right if you'll do these things stat your perfect man if you'll do all these things and like brother BR said get all these revelations in line he said I'll work through you like I worked through Jesus while he was on Earth now that I can understand I said like he worked through Jesus all right now watch in Matthew Jesus tells us that we're talking about marriage and divorce putting a woman away and marrying another and all that stuff he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so all right so from the beginning and I like uh long time ago brother Jimmy Harris preached a preached a sermon on it this ain't so cuz he said from the beginning it was not so this was not supposed to happen this is all temporary everything we think we're so good and strong and big and got buildings and we got you can tell one thing for sure hurricane can take care of that much less the wrath of God which that's what it is but we are the Bride of Jesus Christ right we're the frailest people on in in flesh just as the world right that's right but we have something inside of us that makes us him it makes us act like him right CU what did he do he has put his DNA in US yes he's put his DNA and what is his DNA that big old long name what is it it's his word yes no more than it's his the blueprint of every Christian is the word of God amen amen and what Jesus did and his potent what he had inside of him is what's inside of you now all right so she is him everybody with me that's why brother brand he wasn't wrong when he said that but he had to talk to somebody of maturity to be able to explain and he didn't have time cuz he just said she's him she's got his potential she can be this she can be that well all he's doing is quoting the Bible cuz he didn't bring us anything else but what the Bible said the Bible tells you what you are spotless sinless virtuous he said that a long time ago it's just that man with their with their teachings out there is nothing good no no one you ain't no good and I ain't no good I I I agree but I know somebody that is that said I was right that's right so I'm going to believe him amen because remember if you're not bride he's not your bridegroom that's why God separated through a prophet he said now I call you bride because a bride has his potential this over here now remember to make this very soft they married to the wrong person right right I'm sorry you're either married to Christ or you're married to Satan one of the two right everybody with me if you married to Christ you have his potentials you are him made manifest in another form called a bride sitting here today right right and he is going to show us how to get back into the Garden of Eden right but remember we never going to get back in the Garden of Eden and then we look at just Adam standing there God has divided himself out that's what he wanted in the first place see he knew all this we know he knew all this but his whole plan was for was for this to be multiped lied right this was it multiply he said multiply when it was Genesis 126 multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it now we haven't done that part yet we can't hardly subdue this thing right here but we will we got to bring it under sub subjection right him have the preeminence as brother R said the three-fold purpose see see that whole three threefold purpose does what it brings us back to the Garden of Eden right and know what he said all God was he poured all God what he was he poured into Christ all Christ was every potential everything he did he poured it into the church as a many-membered body right and then the third part was to take us back across the chasm into the Garden of Eden but it won't be just Adam and Eve standing there right it'll be a many membered body called The Bride of Jesus Christ now there'll be people foolish virgins will be given eternal life but they never were bride remember cup of water in my name never was bride now remember even Israel can't be his bride anymore right the 144,000 will receive the Holy Ghost but will not be bride right they forfeited that when they as as uh God told him he said I'm putting you away for your fornication I'm putting you away and I can marry you again I'm going to marry a gentile bride so that's only bride now there'll be Jews that'll be Bride come on there'll be Jews that'll be bride but I'm talking about the Jews of the nation of the 144,000 the ones that are over there now that's not bride they're going to be given eternal life they're going to be given the Holy Ghost right but they can't be bride all right they forfeited that the bride's gone we're out of here amen all right we're gone right so you can't have two Brides see he can't be married to two no all right just married to one so he had to divorce Israel to marry us and he's not going to remarry Israel she's going to have have a position she's going to have a place but he's not ever going to go back and marry her again all right so now look so go to Genesis 126 now she is him remember and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them when he said them that pulled it apart right let them have dominion over the fish of sea and foul of the air cattle over all the Earth ever creeping thing that come upon the Earth so what God did he took a piece of himself set it aside for me and you now a peace of God is God but remember you got you right here you came on this Earth and as Bob said this morning God breathed that Breath of Life inside of you that's right he gave you a soul but he gave you a soul that was perfect he didn't give you a soul that was eternal right he gave you a soul to make a choice a free more agent to make a choice and then you ask God to breathe the breath of eternal life in you brother Dale preached many years ago born by the Breath of God and that's what it is listen you were born by the Breath of God to begin with you were given a soul but I was thinking about when Bob U was preaching this morning you know when when you were born as a baby and you first first first piece of air you sucked in your lungs you were dead you breathe death in your lungs I don't care how clean it was I don't care how beautiful the hospital was and all the positive air that's in there when you and started whining crying you started dying right exactly but God give us a way to reverse that yes sir amen because what he did was is the by the new birth why they call it new by the new birth I believe God literally just breathed himself into us when we receive the new birth how else you going to explain it if you received your first birth that way why can't you receive your second birth that way CU you're born by the Breath of God that's why Jesus breathed on them he didn't he didn't go over there and he said I'm going to give y'all all the Holy Ghost right there I'm going give you all the no he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost right so born by the Breath of God it's the Eternal Breath of God that bursts us into the body of Christ right now we still sucking the same dirty air that we we've been sucking all of our life but we got something inside of us a new nature yes that when we blew out this way when we were in the world things came out that shouldn't have come out before amen bad words bad thoughts bad ideas all that stuff we let it out but by the grace of God he cleaned that up and we don't have that nature anymore am but we're still breathing in this world and we're still dying and we're still getting older but this piece of God sure it is God but it's God dividing himself CU he wanted a family right and God didn't you know as we were growing up I I don't know if Ryan and Gabby said we're going to have four girls surprise but uh you know you want to procreate you that's what we were put here for to m multiply and replenish the Earth right and as they did that now they didn't know how many kids they going to have but God did God knew exactly how many whereever seed would fall all right I'm speaking a little off here but so the kids can understand it a little bit y'all can explain it to them at home but there was many seed went out God has planted many seed out in the world he's give everybody life he gave Adolf Hitler life right but now he didn't breathe the breath of eternal life in him to make him a new creature to put the SE SE Gene of God in that person right and let it develop I like what brother brandom said he said it starts out as a little he even illustrates it as a little Bey uh button little white light and then it just continues to grow and you and I are not we're not just born by the Breath of God we continue with the Breath of God through our Christian experience and if we have to breathe our last Last Breath of the Fallen condition here that doesn't make any difference cuz the first breath you're going to draw is the breath you should have draw had it not been a fall oh yeah they're breathing over there they're not just sitting over there they're human beings right brother R said they human beings they just don't have a body I mean a flesh body your theophan is who you are it doesn't it it doesn't uh that only changes your Dwelling Place so what's inside of you here is going to develop over there it's actually developing here it's just going to you can't take this with you to that other dimension but when they come here now that's another subject when they come here that's a whole different ball game when they come here there's something happen that's going to transform our body and change the very atoms that we have and then we will be Body Spirit and soul that what he saw when brother Brown said God took a picture you before the foundation of the world that's what we're heading toward but remember he's still our father he's still Our Savior he's still our healer but he'll lose some of those when we get across over the other curtain a time all right we don't need healing over there we get healing here we'll always know he's a savior but we won't need to go and bow and and ask forgiveness of our sins that'd be made somebody happy to go through an eternity and never have to say I'm sorry you said all that no we're going to be perfect we can't fathom that you know what I do though I put my confidence that he's already got it set up for me that's right I was thinking the other day been away from June for a week and uh we had our 45th wedding anniversary and I just love I love her and I I I love her to death but brother Ry said that's a drop in the bucket to what that love is that you're that the Cy love amen but think about that you love your wife and you think well man if I go across a curtain of time I'm going to lose that no brother Brown thank God he said you'll always know know she was your wife right there's some things we'll know some things we won't but but you'll think man I'm going to lose this love no no that love is temporary that love is filial love that love has an end when we get over there that agape love is going to be don't what I'm tell tell you don't worry when you get to the other side you'll still remember know that your wife's your wife but you will not love her like you did here it'll be so much higher till you we can't fathom it we can't we cannot fathom it but I just have to believe that God's got it for us yes yes sir you think' married do what no what you have to ask her probably not right don't have to ask her we all know the answer saying if it had been for the word if it hadn't been for if it hadn't been for the Providence of God why you put me on a spot like this if it wasn't for the Providence of God no we would not still be married okay probably not Jun said yeah we would see that's do what yeah yeah that's true that's true but we would well that's why people in the world just say you know that's what I'm saying see you later well like like God said he said what man's joined together I don't know about but what God has joined together let no man put us under so what God joined together will always be together one way or the other all right Jo everybody with me on that okay yes ma'am yes yes oh I thank you I thought of sister Sharon Rose brother's daughter she died when she was 18 months but she somehow knew Billy Paul was her brother and she asked how is my brother Billy Paul right we know I don't understand that but God there again God saw her as an 18-year-old girl whether she made it that or that there or not which obviously she didn't in this side but there's remember there's not going to be babies in heaven brother I just wanted to add to the uh comment on on why because there there is doctrines and there is people that believe this message supposedly that have come to that point to say that the bride is God like literally God yeah and so you fight that a lot in in in Central America and there's but um so so so what the way I think it because I'm just crazy and you all know that amen uh I'm I'm very crazy and and this is simp simple to think I guess maybe to help the the the little ones but a body without a head is a freak body right absolutely but then a floating head by itself without a body is a freak body as well right you'll see those in a couple weeks oh yes and then you see them here in Halloween Halloween so so Satan uses the freak bodies but when it's it's the whole body together the head and he wants us to stay separate that's why he wants us to stay separate if Satan can keep us separate from our head we're afid and we have no power a body don't have any a body can think of moving it hand and if there's not a body there or if a body's there and it's like well I want to walk if there's no head to tell it to walk it's not going anywhere and we do need Christ he is our head amen and and if you say she is him I think it maybe why this question came out she is him now you got you can't literally take that you got to have deser erment as we're going to talk about later on we going to you got to have discernment to discern what brother Brown's saying yes we are God made manifest in another form called a bride so he set a part of himself to the side that b with me the Genesis 126 man CU remember when Adam and Eve sinned there was nothing else coming out of that Genesis 126 man until he died in Calvary right everybody with me I didn't get me many amens are there Adam and Eve were supposed to produce this Genesis 126 man Christ Adam first Adam Christ Eve the bride every how you want to say it it wasn't sex cuz that's what got him out of the garden right but it was spoken word the spoken word of God then we were supposed to come forth right that didn't happen we know that well you know why it didn't happen cuz God saw it he brother B said he he the way he says things is just Scholars don't know nothing brother R said God knew when they were put in flesh bodies they would fall yep all right so he put them in there anyway though because that's what he wanted to do he wanted to have he wanted to fellowship with us not in spirit form in flesh form but the spirit inside of the flesh but what happened was that couldn't happen in the garden and that's why there was a CM God said I'm going to have to take the book back Adam you can't do this I'm going to come and do that's where the Covenant was there was a there was a covenant down here that you're equal but God knowing that they were going to fall and made the second Covenant and we'll read it here in just a little bit in Genesis where he says now sisters you'll have to go under your head and you'll bring children in sorrow and pain and anguish and it don't it and and at Birth it don't stop when you got kids like ours Sister Barbara your old too I thought of it for a while now as Jesus being of the Christ because it takes a head and a body to make one entity so together they are the Christ right exactly good point that's good sister Barbara's quiet but man she can come up with some stuff appreciate sister barbar we should always do appreciate her appreciate at her uh her attitude for the word of God all right so so there we go then you got to have a head and a body Christ listen Christ decided to do this it was his decision nobody remember he said I don't take counsel from nobody because his counsel first is perfect how you going to have how you going to listen to somebody else that was perfect he's the only perfect one so whatever he decided that's way it was going to be he looked down through time we know that in predestination he saw everything he saw all the attitudes he knew Adam was going to do what he did he knew Eve was going to do what he did right but remember as Adam didn't destroy Eve Christ didn't destroy us he's going to enhance us right because that book came back with Jesus on the day of Pentecost that scripture right there was in Jesus Christ wrapped up in him all right it it wasn't in bulls and goats it wasn't in Moses it wasn't in Isaiah hello it was in Christ this was a part of him that he held until he came on Earth and then he had to die to release that book to start releasing the names of his children which would be Peter James John all the ones in the upper room all right everybody with me on that but that's what God decided and if you think well I got it way to do it than you're God and you're the Antichrist now hello that's exactly what Satan wanted to do somebody said that this morning I think that's Satan's whole problem he wants to be God right and that's why you got to be careful with that Doctrine you can get to where you can say I'm God and I can do whatever I want to do right that's what they'll do they but see the the balance I can tell you today that yes we are God made manifest in another form and what we do in our soul what we do is God like it is him that's right all right but on this side over here we're not God to where we make we make decisions above the word of God you can't do that then what you've done is you've made yourself head you've Ed authority over the word of God and there is no word uh authority over the word of God so so that's where they go off on this side but see Satan likes that cuz Satan likes to go over on this side and say man you're right there in the word your Prophet said she is him just like the polygamy thing the the polygamy Doctrine come right out of marriage and divorce where brother R said it wasn't right but he said it was right at a time well somebody I guess figures it this is the time well bless them people want more than one wife so so God created man as own image and the image of God created him male and female now he he's very specific that he pulled them apart and made them male and female right so there's got to be a male and a female because it's got to be a type all the way down Adam and Eve Christ and the bride right it's got to go all the way down so God created man his own image and the image of God created him male and female created he them Genesis 2:7 the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground breathed into his nostril the breath of life and Man became a living Soul right and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward of Eden and there he put a man now watch he put the man woman wasn't there to begin with she's inside of him all right so Genesis 2:20 and AD Adam gave names to all the cattle foul the air beast of the field but for Adam there was not found in help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God took from man he made a woman he took the substance of the man right flesh everybody with me a rib was taken from Adam that was a flesh piece of Adam it wasn't his Spirit it was a flesh piece a literal piece of him and God expanded those cells and made a body right everybody with me all right remember brother Brown said she wasn't created she was from the same Source showing a top that when we get back into the sight of Jesus Christ like we're supposed to be we're of the same Source all right bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life and Adam and brought it to the Man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh literally she shall be called woman which is a man with a womb W man all right because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed there was something going on there that hid them to the carnality they were fixing to head into all right is everybody with me CU we know what happened in the garden all right they walked around naked for centuries and pro and never bothered them one bit until something a little seed was planted not in Eve's physical womb but in her her womb up here right this is where Satan got to her first right here and brother Brown said she stopped brother B talking about moving on she stopped and and just to put it all in context that's why that you know God's not mad at at at at sisters okay God's not mad at sisters right uh when he said you know you can't preach Earth of authority but look what Eve did without an authorative head come on look what she did with her feminist feelings emotions overtook her and she never even considered going and asking Adam what can I do with it what's going on here no she was there she did it cuz she thought brother Ram said she thought she was right so therefore God said I can't allow sisters to teach and preach everybody with me so God's not mad it's the female but what happened in the garden God's got to keep that pattern all the way down through because now here we are at the very end and we have a dominating female Spirit what she ERS authority over her head right naturally and spiritually man I mean naturally now you see things is going on wow if they want to be a woman they can if they want to be a man they can they do whatever they want to do it's just like before the FL when the Bible says every man's thoughts the imagine of every man's thoughts were evil and they thought they were doing the right thing well Eve thought she was doing the right thing all right so the Lord God said unto the serpent now the this is after the fall because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and every beast of the field and on belly Thou shalt go remember turn him into a snake now remember he didn't curse Adam and curse Eve and kill him and you know destroy him he didn't change him into a snake why because he still had a type and a purpose to use that's right where now there's got to be headship and I will put enmity between thee and the woman now Serpent and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel remember that's the promise that Jesus Christ was going to come right through the same thing not through adultery but through creative act of God but still come through a natural womb that baby was born Mary had birth pains right Mary carried that baby and and she had that baby just like all y'all have a baby right all right but it was not of a man it was of God right the way it should have been that's why as we started into the beginning of the creation of God that's what God wanted yes to begin with to to produce the egg and The Germ just back from the Genesis 126 man place it in there and then have baby sorry that's just the way I see it so he put emity though and that's a division emity means to separate so in other words God said look I can't deal with you like I've been dealing I've got to kill this lamb throw it back into there it's going to be the blood now that's going to cover you you got to go to the altar you've got to make a sacrifice and now there's going to start what we're going to talk about in a little while judgment because Adam was judged he was driven out of the garden Eve was judged she was going to well we'll read it and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children now remember at this time she was already pregnant yeah with the two seeds with the with the the Beast and Adam she was already pregnant right here so those two are going to come in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now there's where the Covenant changed where you got headship with a male female under submission all right Genesis 3:20 and and then Adam had to name this person cuz remember she was under him now she wasn't by him she was under him so she had to have a name that separated her from Adam and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them and the Lord said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and and live forever in other words he had to drive them out of the garden he had to separate he had to separate them from from the Tree of Life which is what Jesus Christ right because Adam couldn't be Jesus Christ Adam couldn't be your savior now he typed the first Christ yes he did because when he took Eve he didn't destroy her he took her sin right and said Put it on me God and that's what God did he said okay I'm not going to curse you but I'm going to curse the ground I'm going to curse everything you do you're going to sweat you're going to work that's going to be a word that's still now a bad word in the 21st century let's go now to First Corinthians real quick we got to get through this 1 Corinthians 6 ver verse1 15 know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ all right now here we go shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an Harlot God forbid now remember God separates that in the Book of Revelations there is a harlot church and there's a true church all right shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot God forbid Paul said what know you not that he which is joined to an Harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh but now watch but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit see that Paul he he he he comes down through there and sometimes you get lost in Paul if you don't read the whole thing but you said but but he that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit by one Spirit we're baptized into one body that's why we all have it's got to be something new that's why I totally disagree with people to think we came here with something special already inside of us we had potential God knew what we'd need God had it right there with and and praise God he did put an angel with you when you were born I believe that even through all the bless that Angel's heart all the filth he had to watch well pray for me well don't pray for me it's under the blood you don't have to pray for that any more but we all God knew we'd come to a place how many times have you really thought you was going to die before you got saved I mean several times sister Rebecca got her hand up a lot of us we're just inches of being killed or within inches of ruining our life really right and we were saved by that angel but it wasn't because we had something in us it's because God said hey go take care of that kid right there because when he gets an adult he's mine Lord when he gets an when he get now that to me that's predestination by for knowledge not that there was some little glowing something in me as I was going to The Beer Store I pray for me know y'all ever went but there wasn't there was something there that shielded me from anything well talk about the Providence of God Amen talk about the Providence of God you not knowing one thing caring one thing didn't even know where God was and he had an angel right there beside you the whole time right amen and that angel was given charge just for you keep that kid safe Satan's going to try to kill him amen keep that kid safe cuz I know I got to work for him when he gets older he's going to come to a place he's going to love me and realize I loved him first boy don't ever forget salvation folks we ain't done above down that no we're not above salvation right amen wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord all right for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of that body or that church therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now watch husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it right that he might now listen that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word right being your husband he's going to clean you up if we accept that right if we accept that like brother Rob was talking about the unclean Spirit that's why I can't understand where was that unclean spirit before he was born again it was in your soul right it wasn't playing around in your body it wasn't playing around in your spirit it was in your soul so how can there be an unclean thing and a clean thing in that house right God said I won't dwell in an unclean vessel now the Bible's real clear it says the unclean Spirit right had to be driven out so that the clean Holy Spirit could come in to me that's just you know what it's too simple for people it's just too simple The Simple Plan of Salvation I was lost I was dead and God came and saved me put his soul inside of me and then I was born again right amen two simple for some that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word now what that watch now he might that he might present it to himself you think it say present it to the father or present it to the world but he's going to present her to himself cuz she is him there's where brother R could get that she is him but now look that doesn't mean now watch what Paul says watch this in the red that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish now that's what God said about us now watch the next thing he says now he's going to keep going he's going to drop down on the earth so ought men to love their wives as their own body now he's down here now he that loveth his wife loveth himself okay he that love loveth himself his wife loveth himself he's going to present it to himself CU he loves his wife cuz she is him she has the potential she has everything that he wants in a bride right for no man ever yet hated his own flesh oh no we didn't we've got it all together today and I hope you did for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but look nourish it and cherishes it now remember who are we we're the body so Christ is going to nourish us he's going to cherish us even as the lord of the church which is us now watch for we are members of his body all right so now God's taking us back into his body of his flesh and of his bone Colossians 1 ver5 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist Paul's really laying it out there pretty thick and he is the head of the body the church now remember it took a prophet to tell us what that church was right there cuz see they can read it and say oh he says we the church the church church church church brother BR said I call you bride there's a separation here you're the true church but you're the bride right who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him now watch should all fullness dwell not us in him right and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself he's reconciling his bride back to himself we got separated from him in the garden by him I say whether they be things on earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated wow we were separated from God yes enemies in your own mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblamable unreprovable in his side he did all that for us now notice the quickening power we'll be finished with this right here I think in just a second I'm trying to show you that when you raised when when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you yep right everybody with me amen now remember that theophany that was in Jesus was that Genesis 126 man right that's right that's what Adam should have done over here all right he had a book and he couldn't produce it sin couldn't get us where we need to be right somebody born when no sin had to get us cuz that remember the Genesis 126 man never was born of a Woman by sex no we're born by the Breath of God adults or even kids can get the Holy Ghost but we're not babies a baby can't a baby can't receive the Holy Ghost y'all hear me anyway can't you but so that book was given when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you right but now I want you to realize something when Jesus was body was laying in the Tomb you weren't there exactly brother B said the word the word laid cold and dead in the grave the word body but this is the theophany where did it go it went to hell took you to hell with him right because when he raised up what did he do he just puts the two back together and then was able to not be caught up in this flesh he could Ascend and then send this thing back just say here start producing my children by spiritual birth amen born by the Breath of God now when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickened to life with him you are now quickened to life although then you were but an attribute in in his thoughts but God had saw all in him at the Finish are we not at the Finish we're at to finish when God looked down upon that body the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die a man that's where the people get the quote where they say that Jesus U wasn't God to the River Jordan and then he wasn't God when he's hanging on the cross if God didn't die for me we got to find somebody can that's right cuz God had to now we know God can't die but that body was God's body right I don't know whether you know when the question was a couple of couple of uh ministers meetings ago about Jesus's body being the body of God well let me answer me who's it was answer me tell me if his body didn't come from God then it came from a human man and we're in trouble that's right exactly right so that was God's body amen that's the one he UC from himself his own body and his own blood that was his own guts that was his own heart that was his own lungs and all his other body parts that was God that's right he didn't have to do it remember friends he didn't have to do it that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh we know that for a fact he didn't if he'd have went up there as God he'd never died that kind of death now we understand understand what happened the spirit left him or the anointing left him not the spirit the anointing left him so he could die all right can't kill God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you and him all right she is him but remember we weren't there as individual people that running around inside of Jesus just like you weren't running around inside your daddy right everybody with me yes come on now potentially you were if you look back and know exactly what's going to happen to the exact seed that you were which God did but your mom and daddy didn't right you weren't even in their thoughts but you were in God's so he could take this one and this one put them together to put them together to bring your body here to match the attribute Esau what a mighty God we serve so yes this is all orchestrated by God God had his hand in everything we do if you're a Christian today he had his hand in everything you did uh the bad don't worry about that he saw you repent he knew you'd repent he knew you'd know how to repent and then he knew that when he run this message by your path you'd accept it cuse this message is him the word's him the message is him she is him so that way I can understand that but keep them separate to where we don't pray to ourself we don't pray to oursel hey God what do you want to do today well I don't know what do you want to do today that's silly we have a Heavenly Father we have a headship we have to pray we have to ask God right so that makes him our head right right so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed now watch it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one same same word the same word this is where the quote comes from that like she is him and then he says this later on the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride right amen now he decided that he worded this message the way he wanted it worded amen can you imagine now brother randam is preaching 1100 sermons is everybody with me he died in 1965 let's just say until about 1971 when the church was started here not just because of this church but let's just use it for an example that brother Mo started preaching and he would reach and grab a quote he'd grab a book that brother Ram had already preached this is exciting he reached and grabbed the book and he read a quote that matched the sermon he was preaching that's right not the whole message quote and brother Bob comes today and I'm reading a quote right here that God knew I would use so he had brother R say right right amen what a mighty God we serve right you you think of all the Snippets of quotes that we pulled out I mean like Dad used to use he used 30 quotes from different messages so it was spread out way over here and God knew that brother R was going to have to say this and what a mighty God we say he was going to say this in New York he was going to say this in California he was going to say this in Edmonton New Brunswick he was going to preach this sermon of leadership and all that but there was going to be a man stand here one day and take 30 of them and make a sermon out of it for the present time that's why that was a voice of God yes let's don't throw this thing out it is the voice of God yes sir all right everybody with me on that so she is him we have our potentials everything we do when we are when we are made right again when our body is changed and we're standing in the uh well for us in the Millennium but when we go up to the to the new city that body is not going to be the body that your parents brought oh yeah it's going to be the same frame brother Brown said but not exactly the same gases right and it's not another one it's one that that your parents gave you but it's been changed because the one my parents gave me you're looking at a 64 year old piece of it right you're not going to look at that when we get to the other side you're going to look at a 20-y old piece of what do you what do you mean we're going to be changed that's why that says changed in a moment in the twinking of an eye right all right all right here yes please yes but I don't believe that body is hanging up there on a nail well now listen wait a minute brother random son he's got two or three quotes where they say he that you you know your body's being formed up there right there's a lot of people in this message believe that you got something hanging over in in another dimension and you step in it it's like a bodysuit brother Brown said that body is being formed in you right now right your soul is your theophany right amen what happens when somebody passes away listen the body is in the three dimensions right we can't go through this right here right right right but my soul if it leaves this body it goes right through there and never leaves a hole right just like right now what I'm saying today is going to go in the air waves and it's going right out through the through the the um fiber cable fibers up into the satellite over into another country just like that goes through clouds wood paper metal same way with your soul your soul that's what I was thinking the other day this thing is in such bad shape it is so this right here is so contrary to God to we literally limit that thing coming out of us right when does your soul leave your body when the body can't function the way a human functions right something has happened in your human body because this what you're looking at to me 98.6 this may be stupid as a the day is long but that 98.6 that you are right now when you put a thermometer on you you're everybody should be close to 98.6 degrees do you know why you're 98.6 degrees because your cells are firing they're moving that's your soul your soul is causing that cuz what happens when you die yeah it ain't 98.6 I promise you that we were went down to brother Barry edins and and he I was there when he passed away but just to to make a point I was looking at him and we' been through through dad you know but he didn't have a an oxygen meter on his finger well brother Barry had an oxygen meter you know what that is tells your oxygen count like should be normal 98 97 999 if you're a smoker 88 but usually below 90 they get real that's right well they had one on brother Barry because he was home hospice and there's none of them going to listen to this so I don't want but I want to make a point when oxygen meter was on him when he was getting ready to die it went it was it stayed for an hour it stayed 92 3 94 92 93 94 and when he got got ready to pass away it went from 94 to 88 to 86 to 83 went all the way down to 60 went to 44 and blank and that's when he passed away that oxygen was flowing in but it was shutting down everything was shutting down and his soul was getting ready to leave his body so it was getting ready to take off so that oxygen meter kept getting smaller smaller smaller cuz he couldn't breathe oxygen anymore right his soul was getting ready to leave his body right that's how fragile we are but that's how your body works because you're at the temperature you are now it's because your soul is firing on all cylinders now remember if your temperature goes up it's because something in your body is wrong right right it's not your soul but something in your body has got wrong see that's the Paradox you can go have surgery but you can be born again and June went and had her two shoulder surgeries she ain't got two bad shoulders in her soul and the doctor didn't fix her her soul Dr Jesus did amen ain't that a paradox I mean you can go have all kind of things done I mean even like uh the brother at um what's his name brother Neil storm uh he had his arm cut off years ago he he always said he said it's there I just can't see it you just can't see it he said my theophany ain't got just one arm and he's right that's how that's how that we can't see in that other dimension but he's right I mean God's not going to create it over there when they cut when they cut Paul's head off his head rolled down into the into the ditch well when he stepped across the curtain of time he didn't have to pick his head up and put it back on his his body listen you can't kill a soul only God can kill a soul that's right you can be shot up and everything else and you'll leave the body that you're in because it can't function anymore but your soul is over there ain't got bullet holes in it ain't got scar marks on it that's right it's just as perfect as it ever was if you're a Christian right oh what a mighty God we serve he's got all this figured out we're just trying to all figure everything out but when you're if you're firing today what is making me do what I'm doing my soul right my soul is making me do what I'm doing cuz if my soul wasn't in his body I wouldn't be picking his finger up moving it praise God Amen okay all right let's go here's the second question when we go into the Rapture what happens to the left behind all right now remember there was a movie called Left Behind in some of the denominational World they believe that you can get saved after the Rapture takes place don't get silent on me you've never watched Left Behind go watch it with Kurt Cameron years ago planes are falling out of the sky cars are having wrecks because people are disappearing but he's there and somebody else is there and two or three other and some one of his friends is still there but they get saved after the Rapture takes place that ain't going to happen sorry that that's not going to happen thank God for a prophet that could tell us those things so when we go in the Rapture what happens to the left behind now here in first Thessalonians Paul tells us for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep in other words we're not going to prevent we can't hold back there's a bar holding back those Souls right Dad and all the different ones there's a bar all right but when that bar is loosed you ain't going to say oh no we're not ready for them yet hold the door no they're coming here they're coming they're coming here that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend now see the world is waiting on that event right there yep right we already seen it yes sir we're actually part of it amen see that's where you and I yeah we're special people cuz we pulled we picked mind of God and that's what we know what he's meaning when he says that for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout we know what that is it's not he the voice of an archangel and Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first you and I are included in that that's right amen these two scriptures are is everybody sitting in this room right now the first one is we which you're alive and remain all right and then those that are coming when the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds now look if you take that scripture you say well the Dead's going to raise then we're going to what are we just going to go up with them or no brother Brown said we'll be changed then Paul tells us again so you will be changed in the moment in twink of an eye you got to put why I took a prophet to put these scriptures together for us then we which are alive and remain may I interpolate will be changed right right in the moment in the twinking of an eye we which are alive and reain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words 1 Thessalonians 51 but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I Rite unto you now this is Paul Now look for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief and a KN all right so it's not going to be this event everybody's looking for right listen this whole thing to take the bride home is secret yes it's a secret catching away nobody's going to know about it but the bride remember brother ran said they'll go where's brother Ryan well he probably took a trip took a vacation him and the kids and wife you know there they'll be back all they won't for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape now this is the Left Behind group everybody with me right here let's go back for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night that is the rapture of his bride everybody with me that's the Rapture of his bride it's not talking about the church now talking about no judgment yet just a bride for when that the Left Behind is that okay I know it's warm and we're back to sleeping again but I'm going to answer these questions anyway whoever's whoever ask them is going to be awake so for when they and we're we're archiving it too so you can watch it online for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them that's not us right folks brothers sisters have confidence that these scriptures that are that look horrible are not for me and you right amen that's why you want to try to get them all in because you know that destruction is coming right these things that happened in Florida and North Carolina toothache compared to what's coming yes sir toothache I was thinking yesterday all that effort and we've been doing it and brother Boyd's been doing a real good job him and Sister Janet we it didn't bother us right none of us down here I mean probably 45 of the 48 continent States not Alaska and Hawaii they weren't affected either but we weren't affected so we're sending resources they're going to have so much stuff they probably not going to want to do with them right but what if that happens all over the United States what if those events happen in California New Mexico Texas Kentucky Arizona new me uh New England states if that spreads itself out sorry folks it's going to be like that that that woman did a good job she was a mayor of one of them towns Sarasota or somewhere she said if you stay you're going to die she said you decide to stay write your name on your arm and your next of Ken on your arm cuz you're not going to make it right pretty plain well guess what if you're not bride material you're not going to make it and then you can't write your name you need to have your name written in the loue Book of Life don't worry about it writing on your hand right for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape think about it again we we we've just sent tons of stuff to one area what if your area is affected and then your neighbor's area is affected the EMTs are going to be blessed their heart if they're left here they're going to go crazy they won't be able to get to all the the what's going on fire engines and all that stuff that we can take and send I mean they sent in Florida they had what they have like 5,000 trucks of electrical trucks and yeah they kind of got it all put together together in about 2 weeks what if that happens all over the United States they ain't enough trucks listen folks this is a wrath of God that's coming amen that you will not Escape right but ye Brethren are not in darkness now he's talking to us that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night they that are drunk are drunken the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath amen God said but God said I'm not going to point the this any of this that's going to happen I'm not pointing it to you for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ Matthew 25 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be liken under 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom now listen folks this is 10 people that are part of Christianity this is not five the five foolish is not five drunks no right they're church members they're churchgoers right everybody with me five of them were wise five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessel now what is the oil the Holy Ghost we know that while the bridegroom carried that's what's happening now the bridegroom is taring they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him now look they all woke up right they all woke up and do was it five kept sleeping and five woke up then all those virgins woke up trim their lamps the problem is is like brother Bob was saying this the problem is is these over here in the foolish Parts they'd Sanctified they thought they had the Holy Ghost they thought they had the oil right these five over here continued on they made sure they went to their closet made sure they had oil in their lamps right you better make sure you got oil in your lamp amen right cuz the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out now look the Holy Ghost is for everybody you can't exhaust the Holy Ghost but there's going to be a time when he said this is it right brother Bown even makes a statement I tried to find it but I couldn't word it right where the Holy Ghost will lift up lift up off the Earth wow did you know what we're going with it now that Holy Ghost is going to come back on 144,000 but when we come up all that wrath is going to take place and the food they said under the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you sounds really selfish but you know what they're saying you've had time you've had time you've been with us we've been in the same church not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go and rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut no one else is going to be saved after that door shut right afterwards came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh questions and answers conduct order and Doctrine at Mount trans Transfiguration before Jesus went to Calvary there stood Moses and Elijah standing there talking to him certainly they did they're not dead and they never died they're Mortals they got to die so they're just in the glorified State waiting for that time and then when they come back and preach exactly three and a half years under the anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember he didn't say New Birth under the anointing of the baptism of Holy Ghost while the blessings are taken from the Gentiles and the church is taken up and the cold formal church is hunted down like dogs by the communist and Roman parties and then they're hunted down and killed they listen they're still virgins they still got a testimony right they just missed it they didn't go they didn't further go further with God some preacher stood behind the pull pit and said you believe the message don't you you always was well how else are they going to hear that they going to hear from somebody that says you're all right we're not all right right amen then these prophets preached three and a half years the Bible said that they were killed in the street of C Sodom and Egypt where our Lord was crucified that's back in Jerusalem back in Jerusalem spiritually called so when we go up there's no more person saved I don't care listen they'll probably fill churches up when start stuff starts happening that's what happened in 9911 right they put prayer back in they had a National Day of Prayer and you can't even pray in school that's right but after a while what happened oh that's been 20 years ago now we we're good now we can do whatever we want to do taking sides with Jesus we we we realize in Revelations that just the one two three chapters to the church now remember Revelations 1 2 and 3 the church goes up in the fourth chapter it does not return anymore till the 19th Chapter that's after the tribulation period when God calls out the Jews that's right and like Enoch he went up before one drop of rain every hit the earth he was gone then the tribulation set in now remember Enoch TI the bride Moses I mean Noah does not typ the bride no no types of natural Church they got to go through yeah right and like Enoch he went up before one drop of rain ever hit the earth he was gone then the tribulation set in see Noah was in the ark before any tribulation set in lot was out of Sodom before any tribulation set in and the church will be gone before any tribulation period now we know he's talking about the bride now during the tribulation that will be the sleeping virgin will be hunted down by the dragon and spurts water from his mouth which means multitudes and people armies that will search down and take this woman REM her seed and will kill her now that will be in the tribulation period but the church will go home right all right first seal now notice he'll conquer and almost has in his grip right now talking about Antichrist while he's still Antichrist before he can become Beast you talk about cruel punishment you just wait watch what them that's left here on Earth will have to go through there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth for the dragon Rome spurted water out of his mouth and make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that was left upon the Earth after the bride had been selected and took out and the dragon made war with the remnant that didn't want to come in was hunted down and the real church will go through that if it was possible but you see they are done under the blood of the grace of Christ and not going through have no tribulation period the next thing for the church is the rapture that's why I said the great one of the great Revelations you can have all the other ones my Revelation is if I'm born again there's a lot of stuff in the Bible I ain't going to say I ain't going to be able to see it I'll read it I'll know it's going to happen but I really don't think though that we're going to be in a marriage supper and we're going to have to look down and go I wonder what's going on down no we know what's going to happen right future home just a little while will be summoned then the Rapture will come just a little bitty group like Enoch will be taken up then the remnant of the woman seed that keep the Commandments of God remember they're trying to be Christians right Jews have the testimony of Jesus Christ Gentiles will be hunted down like dogs and shall give their life for their testimony then one great morning the break of the Millennium for the honeymoon will start then the rest of the Dead live not till the end of the Thousand Years then at the end of the Thousand Years there was a judgment showing that ham was in the ark cuz remember judgment went a cross he had to be judged on the other side ones that heard it and rejected it will have to be judged all right now here's here's the number three please explain the two judgments now remember there's two judgments in the Bible all right here's the first one Romans 14:10 then but why Dost thou judge thy brother or why do thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ now remember that doesn't say white Throne judgment that says the Judgment seat if you look in your Bible pilot had a judgment seat somebody in a couple of people in the Old Testament had a judgment seat and he was a judge he sat on the seat and they would come in and he would judge their issues all right for it is written as I live say the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God as I've said many times before everybody's going to do that but me and you do it with honor yes others are going to be made to do it right so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling BL block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way 2 Corinthians 5:8 we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that's the second time Paul said that that everyone may receive the things done in his body the Judgment of your soul is over but there's going to be some things lingering we'll get to it in a minute there's lingering things that you're either going to have to give an account here or there right right not of Salvation not of not of um eternal life but remember we all get crowns and we get places to we get Thrones dominions this thing ain't going to be I don't think it's going to be like we think it is you know the first government we talking about government government you know what the first government is was God set up the first government and he said he put it on his shoulders that's right we'll have government a governing body that's right aren't we going to be the governing body the bride in that City and then you got billions living outside the city that may not even know Jesus was even a person and we're going to get to tell him about him right oh you don't think that I do for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according that he hath done whether it be good or bad now this is us this is not this is not the white Throne judgment all right this is the white Throne judgment but now watch in Revelations 20 brother brownon makes a statement I didn't bring it cuz we're going to using more time than I thought we would Revelations 20:4 says says I saw Thrones and they sat upon them now obviously the people being judged are not going to be sitting on the throne let's not talking about them right so where are these Thrones and who are these people they're the bride that's right and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that would be headed for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon his forehead or in his hands and they lived and reigned with Christ 1,000 years so that has nothing to do the people that are going to the white Throne judgment when they die they're not going to be alive through the tribulation I mean through the um um Millennium white throwing judgment is after the millennium right right amen but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years Revelations 20:1 and I saw a great white Throne now we've come to the place to where it's all going to culminate and be done with and him that sat on it for those face the for whose face the Earth and Heavens fled away now that's not us we know our God right and there was found no place for them you know these people been born lived and rub shoulders with you that there's no place for them except hell that's right wow and I saw the dead small and great stand before God now that's not us come on that's not us and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life we may cover that a little bit later on and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to the works I thought we I thought we were judged by Christ that's right he took our judgment so whatever he is that's what we get right so he's the one sitting on the throne we're the one sitting on the Thrones amen judging the Earth and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to the works you and I will never as bride be judged according to our works for eternal life thereby with me but you will have to be judged we're going to get to it in a minute some men sins go before some go after all right so hang on a minute we are going to all Paul's right we're all going to go before the Judgment seat of Christ but that's not the white Throne judgment it's two different judgments all right is everybody with me right and the Sea gave up the dead death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to the works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast in the Lake of Fire there some people named was even in the book Canon father God knew if you give them a million years to repent they never would repent right that's the God I serve the god that knows everything amen Daniel 7 and I beheld till the Thrones there we go again plural were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit remember what is he the judge and whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool his throne was like fiery flame and his wheels burning fire a fiery steam issued and came forth before him thousands now love this right here thousand thousands ministered unto him stop and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him am there's way more people going to be judged before him than they are ministering to him brother Brown said said the bride ministers to her husband right so that's the bride thousand thousands but look down there 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open now what does that mean using the context of a legal trial to refer to a final finding statement or ruling based on a considered weight of evidence talking about judgment called adjudication which you take what does a judge do a judge sits there and takes this side and this side and he judges them right all right now remember Paul tells us a little bit later on Paul tells us that he's the righteous judge but then he tells us that the Saints will judge the earth and the Saints will judge the Angels 1 Corinthians 2:14 but the natural man now this is where watch real quick but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God all right they're separated there's a group of people that don't care about God so they don't receive receive any of the blessings of God right for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned but now watch brother Bob we the Judgment you know there's a place in the Bible says judgment one and don't judge and do this and do that and if we we read a scripture for a communion it says judge not that you be not judged watch now this is where it all penel down to one little area but he that is spiritual judges all things right amen EXA yet he himself is judged of no man wow yes sirud that's correct I think I got I think I may have that scripture but I know I have it yes he didn't say not judge no no but you can't you what he's saying is and and let me put it this way we go and I got to have some water but I got to get this Bible people people will say uh don't judge me because the Bible says you know judge notless be judged first right right but now watch this is the Bible this is the word of God right it's not a pair of binoculars it's a mirror it's not a pair of binoculars I'm looking at your I'm judging you judge yourself that you be not judged right now listen folks sometimes I have to put on binoculars being a pastor I got to watch for the Sheep right okay I have to do that but you got to do it with righteous judgment not with well I think I'm right and you're wrong but use this as a mirror quit doing this well if if if if brother boy is straighten up well he just said him I'll amen me brother way to straighten up everybody else says amen and start reflecting yourself cuz right here but he that is spiritual judgest all things am yet he himself is judged of no man now watch for who hath known the mind of the Lord you got to have because Paul says look that he may instruct him for who hath known the mind of the Lord who the bride and it's got to be a mature bride I'm not going to go into a courtroom and have a case tried and I have a June sitting judging she's like really what would she know it she would have no knowledge we have a righteous judge that has knowledge we have a we have a white wigged one but even in the courts of the United States they don't put people in judgeship at 20 years old no how many of you ever walked I've never been but one courtroom and he was an old man why because you have to have if you're spiritual you can discern spiritual things now watch for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have all right we can't instruct God and him do the Judgment but we have that same mind of the judge right if we do it right if we spiritually discern things watch this right here moreover it is requ ired in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you now this is Paul talking to the Corinthians who were babies right Corinthians the book of Correction they were babies they worshiped Idols they they had the Lord's supper and they were getting drunk and they were having a a feast instead of having the solemn Lord's Supper Paul had to always tell them you're looking at Idols you're doing this you're doing that stop it quit right right right but with me is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment yay I judge not my own self now hold on if you stop right there then you've done away with me saying this needs to be a mirror cuz that's what you do you judge yourself right for I know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby Justified but he that judges me is the Lord right see if you take somebody like Paul and brother brandham that were true prophets prophets to the end time to their time and they were true word prophets they are judged of no man they're judged of God only right we don't Jud we have no right to judge brother brandom that's right cuz we're not spiritually Discerning it that at that high of an office is that good enough at that high of an office you don't judge a prophet you can't say brother Ryan was wrong here here and here and here no he told you when he was wrong and I accept that amen all the other times he's right right for I know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby Justified but he that judges me is the Lord now watch therefore judge nothing before the time right until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart and then shall every man have Praise of God now let's break this down just for a second therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart all right and then shall every man have Praise of God 1 Timothy 5: 24 some men's sins are open beforehand I've done something against brother Donnie I've said publicly or even privately forgive me of that sin if you do that it's done right now if I do something to brother Donnie and I don't ask forgiveness it will follow me to that day that we're at the Judgment seat of Christ where we got to give an account of the things that we not what we got rid of here but what we carry there even being born again Christians right come on cuz if we all got to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ there is a judgment right some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after in other words they go with you well somewhere as I said before Christianity is based on righteous judgment everything actually after the fall is under judgment amen or no right all right now watch likewise all Al the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hit you remember I told you several years ago when I started preaching after after dad's um stroke I told you that the Lord kept convicting me about that one thing I said about a brother right right right if I had not got that right number one it would have hindered my experience it would have hindered my Ministry yes sir you know why cuz it eat at me that's right he didn't even know it it eat at me y so when I called him and got rid of that listen I'm telling you asking forgiveness is one of the greatest feelings you'll ever get in your life amen it's the mirror that's right but you'll never be judged for that if you get it out but right here God said he'll get it right that scripture before he's going to get it right into the counsel of your heart yeah he's going to dig it out and he's going to tell us whatever time that judgment is the Judgment seed of Christ he's going to say brother Wade you wrong brother Donnie and you didn't ask forgiveness right now here's the problem this is not a blanket forgiveness will y'all just forgive me for anything I've done yes and I can't stand somebody to say this if I've done something wrong good Lord if I've done means I had I don't think I have but you'll never get forgiven for that you're going to it's going to judge you when you get there Godly sorrow the Bible says leads us to repentance right when you're sorrow really sorry I was I wasn't sorry for what I said about that brother when I said it cuz I meant it but it was wrong and when I called him he said brother wait I don't even know what you're talking about said but I sure forgive you for it and that will never have to go with me right I think a lot of the times even our Christian experiences hindered because we think we're right so much in our eyes that we don't see ourselves we just leave it right there some men's sins are open beforehand some going before the judgment and some mens they follow after likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid you we're not going to hide anything from God I don't care if you're an absolute Christian you still got a spirit y that is contrary to God right regardless you got things in your spirit that's not in your soul amen right vice versa exactly right now here's one right here Book of Luke Luke 6:36 y'all just hang with me that these questions are important it's important the person to ask you I remember brother R said that one time he said this may not to be important to you but it's important to the person that asked the question all right Luke 6:36 be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful we ought to try that sometime judge not now watch Judge not and you shall not be judged but now we got to keep going can't stop there that's right or either I'd have nothing to preach brother Randon would had nothing to preach Jesus would have had nothing to preach if there was not some kind of judgment that went with what was being said right judge not and you shall not be judged look condemn not and you shall not be condemned forgive and you'll be forgiven right if you can't forgive God's not going to forgive you that's right I mean with an honest heart I'm sorry sorry I crossed the line I did something wrong but if I didn't give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down and shaken together now this is Jesus talking and running over shall men give unto your bosom why because you give give it shall be given to you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give un your into your bosom for with the the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again yes Jesus said that 1 Corinthians 6 verse1 now here's Paul this is the prophet dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the Saints he's asking them a question and let's stop right here because somebody asked me a question one time this says what we'll read them a little bit further but dare any of you having a matter against another now he's who's he talking to the Bible is written to Christians everybody with me he's talking about a brother suing a brother or a brother taking another brother to court he didn't say a heathen listen if somebody hits you and and and breaks your body up and you know and and and it was their fault and they were drunk you listen you can do what you want to do right well I ain't supposed to take a brother to court that ain't your brother somebody asked me that one time I said that ain't your brother it says a brother has a problem with a brother don't go to court right You' put Bob out of business if somebody didn't sue somebody a lot how many lwes you got in that firm 600 sorry buddy you ever read them scriptures about Jesus said La was go enter into heaven no he said it was hard for a lawyer to enter Heaven that's right you don't have many Bible studies down there do you nope do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall J judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life and yes if you have an ought against a brother let us come together here brother brother bring the deacons bring the elders the the preachers let's get this thing worked out don't take somebody to court and sue a brother cuz somebody backed out here and our parking lot's full and morning most of the time you back out and hit somebody or or knock somebody down don't go to court settle it here right that's right that's a brother and a brother now you get run over out there on the Highway by some drunk that ain't your brother right and you can do what you want to do you can forgive him or sue him he ain't going to make it this is not what this is talking about this is people in a church sitting taking I I don't like brother Lu he did something to me I'm gonna take him to court and we're GNA let heathens decide our fith no if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life watch set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church yall know what that means the least person in the church that has the Holy Ghost now can be set in judgment can can determine judgment that's what he says set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church I speak to your shame is it so that there's not a wise man among you what is one of the nine gifts wisdom know not one that shall be able to judge between his brother so don't take a brother to court we judge it here right Revelations 19 verse1 we got to hurry and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power Toto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with a fornication now we're going to get to something in just a second where does judgment begin Bible's pretty plain brother brand has like 200 quotes judgment begins at the house of the Lord right but not the building it's not the Judgment of the the church you know no we'll get to it Ecclesiastes 314 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor taken from it right thank God for that God can't lie amen God can't tell an untruth God can't speak and it not be true right and God doeth it that man should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be Authority been and God requires that which is passed so he covered what Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now watch and moreover I saw Under the Sun the place of judgment that the wickedness was there and the place of right rightousness watch that iniquity was there wow I said in my heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked right now to me there's your two judgments CU remember what is Iniquity remember it's the first seal but you know what iniquity is it's it's knowing I have an odd against Louise knowing I have an against Louise and don't do anything about it that's iniquity the Bible said iniquity shall abound and that's not just for out there that's for in here right here's what it says look and the place of righteousness that iniquity was there I said in my heart God shall judge the righteous judgment seed of Christ and the wicked that didn't accept Christ white throwing judgment for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work Ecclesiastes is pretty heavy but if you read it it's good for you Romans 2 ver4 despises thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God see leadth you to repentance if you don't believe you need to repent you won't right hello right you won't cuz that's the Devil's Playground no you ain't got to do that what brother Dell say if you didn't get it out of the way real quick about 2 days later it was their fault right a't that the truth a't that the truth right it was their fault to begin with yeah right but after th hardness and impenitent heart treasur up unto thyself wrath what building up unconfessed sin building up iniquity against the day of Wrath and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God now watch who will render to every man according to his deeds questions and answers now we've been through that if a man can be a sinner and be punished forever he can't be punished forever because he's got eternal life if he's got eternal life he's saved you know what he's covering so there's only one type of eternal life and that's the Zoey life of God and he can't perish but the wicked are in a place of waiting in torment for their judgment they're not being judged right now they're in a place holding for their judgment but it's not a nice place to be judged according to the Deeds Done in the body at the last day but some men's sins go before them some follow after them now if we confess our sins he's just to forgive us therefore we'll never have to stand the Judgment of of God the white Throne judgment we will not stand right you get it look Romans 8:1 therefore there's no condemnation to them they're in Christ Jesus pass from death into life let's keep continue to saf for time and I've been accepted in Christ Christ took my judgment and I accepted his perpetuation for my sins how can God judge me he's done judge me when he judged Christ then I'm free from judgment then when I see the blood I'll pass over you see but now the wicked is not so he goes into a place of torment and we know that that's true the wicked is alive he's in a place of Torment 1 Peter 4:16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God in this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first began at us what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel of God in other words if we're being judged here oh my the world has got to go to the white Throne judgment there's no other they weren't judged in here I don't mean in this building I mean in the word of God right and if the rightous scarcely be saved where should the ungodly and The Sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as into to a faithful creator brother Bri Redemption by judgment listen cadis barnel was once the Judgment seat of the world there a great spring and many little Springs leading off of it which is the perfect type again Christ being the Big Spring the church be the little spring off of Christ the Judgment seat judgment begins at the house of God here's where we are judged and isn't it a pity that when we see that we're wrong watch and doing the wrong thing living the wrong kind of Life associating wrong and everything that we're just not big enough to walk up and say God I'm sorry I'm the one that's wrong that's right wow you're right and I'm wrong and you forgive me and help me to do better the next time if we if we just that that real about ourselves but we don't we hear the gospel preached and we say oh well I don't even believe it that way 2 Timothy 4:7 Paul's coming to the end of his life he said I fought a good fight finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing he's appeared right have we missed it so what happens we have two judgments one judgment is a judgment Deeds of the body whether good or bad when we leave this place then you got a white Throne judgment that's over a thousand years later that is going to be the thousands times 10 thousands of people are going to be judged by the word of God which that's what you are right so so there's your two judgments all right couple more what is discernment now here's a quote from brother brandham he knows that if the people now we've quoted this many times but let's see if we can understand it a little better he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and that and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church let me stop you right here Judas and Jesus were in the same church Judas was Sanctified according to the Bible hello Jesus Sanctified him hello that's how close it is Jesus was the only one that knew who Judas really was the other 11 didn't have a clue they were totally out and left fi and by God's spirit discern now that's the question is what is the discernment of that and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it and with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them now we just got finished talking about judgment judgment and discernment go together because you discern to judge right all right you discern to judge now discernment means the ability to judge well or in Christian context perception in the absence of judgment with a view to obtaining spiritual guidance and understanding then the example was without providing for a time of healing and discernment there will be no hope of living through this present moment now brother Brown tells us 600 and something times he talks about Discerning in the prayer line now what happened during that discernment CU that's a perfect example he goes into somebody's life God goes into their life he don't right God takes him into their life and by discernment says you wor the there yesterday he had on a blue coat he had a um clipboard in his hand the nurse was standing beside of him and there was your X-ray now he took all that all that was discerned to be the truth all right and then off of that he made a judgment because of what the person was standing there because remember he said sister one time he say sister you're you're not getting this it's going over for you you know she he was really trying to and he was talking to her she was the only one he was talking to and she missed it cuz she didn't discern right now watch Romans 12 ver1 now what is discernment I beseech you therefore brethren for the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing over your mind now watch that you may prove now that word prove if you look it up in the in the Greek that word prove means discern or judge cuz you got to be able to discern the good and acceptable perfect will of God as brother Bob and I were talking a little bit ago and I'm working on a sermon somebody come up to you and say the Lord spoke to me and told me X right well I'll promise you folks if act don't come to pass you probably got a different Lord you're listening to the wrong Lord somebody said the other day we talking said that's the most that word is what the Lord told me what the Lord told me but the Lord's been wrong a lot no sorry he ain't wrong you're listening to the wrong Lord cuz remember the Satan can be the Lord of your life oh come on oh no not me I'm a Christian no don't start that with me he'll jump on all of us if you let him right exactly but when you say the Lord told me because listen when you discern that it's God it's got to come to pass that's right if you discern it's God and it don't come to pass brother R said you got an evil spirit on you remember what brother R said one to stand up and and and speak in tongues and one prophesy or somebody prophesy and say tomorrow brother Anderson's house you going to burn you need get out of your house well tomorrow nothing happens next day nothing happen he said you've got an evil spirit on that person and in your church right find it it'll tell you he said because God's never wrong the discernment brother R had never was wrong because it wasn't his it was God's right and be not conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so back over here we see discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit now remember where is the Antichrist Spirit oh it's out there in the Baptist Church oh I'm sorry it's in Rome it's at the Vatican it might have come out of the Vatican but it's right here our thoughts against God are anti- good that's why as Believers we got to keep believing and believing and saying God I don't see it but I believe it right and if I can put it in your word and and these ministers can line it up with the message of the hour and we can have take the Bible and put it right like brother R said the two you know looking at the at the U sites then believe you that's the will of God and that's the that's we've discerned the perfect will of God right so now a couple more an example was Judas and Jesus here's Jesus he discerned that spirit because he's the son of man he knew that all the other 11 thought that Judas was just going to go out and buy buy some more food or pay for the food right cuz remember Jesus said go do what you're going to do he even said the one that stops a bowl in front of me is the one that's going to betray me and there's Judas sing in the bowl all 11 were de except for one man the son of man is the only man that wasn't deceived that's why the son of man in the end time has to come back to discern the very Mind Of God right you say oh we can't be right yeah we can if the word's right and we bring it right and we catch the mind of God right then the think can't be wrong now watch this Matthew 24:23 says then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not oh pretty good now that that that person is acting like Christ to a degree might now this is in the seals all right Jesus is preaching the seals Matthew 24 for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders well we're just sitting here dead as a door now trying to preach word of God best we can but boy they got they raising the dead over there well what do they believe well they're polygamy but that's okay that's all right you know they they believe in two Lords and they believe brother randam was God and well that's okay as long as they raised the dead people are going to flock to it folks they going to take the bait leave the hook right for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before now this is Jesus wherefore if they shall say behold he's in the desert Tucson nothing against toon but that's a desert go not forth behold he's in the secret Chambers believe it not and I preached about this a long time ago do you know why you know where God's at where Christ is you know he's inside of you that's right I don't have to go to the desert to find Christ but what if I don't have Christ in me what if I am a foolish virgin what if I am been told that I got to go to the desert to listen to brother so and so Jesus said believe it not right now watch for as the lightning cometh out of the East East and shineth even into the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be nobody's going to know it but the son of man for wh soever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together you will be deceived if you're not born again no doubt you're going to be deceived you are deceived if you're not born again that's right acts 9:4 and he fell to the Earth no I'm sorry this is um a question that um a sister gave me the and I didn't know the answer was this till till several years ago uh in Acts 9:4 remember Saul Saul was on his road to Damascus God knocked him off his horse maybe that's what we need and he fell to the Earth our high horse and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying un to him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks now I didn't know this and until uh brother Jeff traml told me what this was and he's old enough to remember it but when you have an ox cart or when you have a donkey that's pulling a cart sometimes that donkey gets a little ill and he starts kicking the cart well down at the bottom there's a rod or iron go that sticks out at the bottom of it to when he kicks against a prick it kicks him it punctures his leg and he puts his foot down that's what he kept telling Paul he said Saul you keep kicking against the very thing that's trying to carry you you're kicking against the prick so that's what it is is an iron go for urging on ox and horses and another Beast of Burden hence the proverb to kicks against the go or to offer Vain and perilous or ruinous resist resistance in other words God said Saul I've been trying to work on you and you're just you're just kicking us the same place all the time so that's what kicking against the prick means anybody else have a statement on that but brother Jess trma he said yeah we used to have him out here see if when cuz he was like 80 something years old 20 years ago and uh he said yeah we used to have them said the old mu would start kicking backwards and he'd knock the whole card over he said you put a rod out there with a little um um sha um shave it like a pencil he said that thing kicks it one time and when he kicks inside that hoof he won't kick it no more so that's what God was saying Paul you're really hard-headed you need to if you kicked it one time and it pricked you you need to quit kicking it again all right Sarah marunga what does married to Christ mean Sarah's grown up look at her she is so grown up married to Christ means that you have the new birth that's pretty much the whole thing you can't be married to Christ and be married to the world you got to shun the world get rid of the world and to get married to Christ brother Brown said he puts on the wedding band of Grace unmar favor and you become his wife that's when you get born again when you get born again you become attached when I got married to June we became attached to each other all right so I was married to her she was married to me so when we get married to Christ that means we give him everything male and female we're all females in the body of Christ everybody with me Bride is a wife even though us strong males we're still feminist in the body of Christ so we have to lay our head over on Christ when we become his wife we give everything to him amen and that means your soul you give it all to him and then you're married there's a union so you and Christ can talk together not you and your mama or you and your dad you or your brother you and Christ it's an intimate relationship and and that's what happens when you get married right there's a relationship there well that's the same way with Christ but it's not in a carnal form it's in a spiritual form all right that okay to be married to Christ is to be born again you will be his bride um Sister Barbara can't be my bride because I'm not married to her I'm married to Sister June all right so we're coming together we we're coming together and making a marriage ceremony so when you get born again that's your marriage ceremony all right okay couple more and then we'll be done if you are uncertain about a personal issue and the scripture isn't clear on how to go about dealing with it do you reach out to your pastor yes absolutely or a minister or somebody with wisdom and somebody listen somebody you have confidence in CU if you can't get an answer for yourself then maybe you're either not going about it right yes right right that's why he's talking about judgment we shouldn't go out there and let them tell us like if say sister Bella goes and and um goes out there and and they say well you you can wear pants you what do you mean you no no I don't I don't because the Bible tells us that's a judgment against them everybody with me there's a judgment against them all right but they're trying to judge you and say you're wrong that's where you got to have discernment and judgment and it be the righteous judgment and have the righteous discernment to have the right discernment like sister Junes says if you've got a spiritual question you can't go ask a drunk what are you going to get right I mean really what are you going to get why would you why would you if you had a and I'm talking about a spiritual if you need a natural answer if you got parents go to them first is that right cuz brother R said your daddy was your Holy Ghost until you get the Holy Ghost amen or you marry somebody and you better both have the Holy Ghost so if you've got something a personal issue I'll be happy happy any of us um ministers uh to counsel with you to go about dealing with it but don't go out in the world and and listen counselors have a place everybody with me counselors have everybody's got a place right I don't say go to counseling but why would you go and listen to Somebody That was that has a totally different view than you do they're not born again they wear pants they they do all the things of the world and you need to get spiritual advice from them or they can help you with their Spirit you're deceived right right that's why the Bible says judge in here that's the same thing right judge in here if you've got a personal issue please come to me I'll talk to you anytime or uh like I said if you're a young child or anything I don't know who this is I can't the writing is got to be a female cuz I can read it um I couldn't read if it's a male but uh if if you have a an opportunity um if you have a parent go to them first but I mean if you're 30 years old and you got 50y old parents yeah well you're not married but listen there's a headship there you got to remember there's a headship one more time there's a headship we'll be done here in just a second there's a headship your dad is your head while you're at home right amen right right same way with the men or boys daddy told us said long as you put your feet under my table and eat my food you going to do what I tell you exactly that's right if you want to do your own thing go find your own table find your own food and find your own place to live and that's why I told my kids they said why dad why can't we do what we want to I said all right I said I'm going to bring you the mortgage I'm going to bring you your car payment and mine oh by the way I need new shoes oh I need Air Jordans I don't want none of them con them Converse uh uh knockoffs oh and I need I need you you know I like State dad or son just can you get me some of all that I said oh the power bills due next week it's like 180 bucks oh the cell phone yeah you you need to pay that too and I just kept rattling off all these things and they're both going I said when you can do all that you can have total control of this place right amen but it's as long as I'm the king of this castle and I pay all these bills and I go to work and work two to three jobs and you don't you're going to do what I say I don't care if you're 100 years old right so they left so they left so they left and went somewhere else where' Josh go he let he knew I was going to talk about it but I did they said dad what can we do to be able to do what we want to do I said either leave or do this one of the two I said you got a choice I said if you go out there ain't paying you bills but the same way with a personal issue you got a father talk to your father if you don't want to talk to your father then come to me please and we'll discuss it if it's a sister we'll have to have sister June youall understand one thing it ain't because we want to both know what's going on but I'm not going in that room with a with a female by myself I don't care if you're the greatest friend in the world my mama and my wife would be the only two people i' go in that room and shut the door with all right because it just keeps the devil at Bay right all right the church has gifts does that mean without the body of Believers that's gathered in the building are outside individuals hold on a minute I like brother Ram he brother BR one time he said hey can you read this can you read this the church has gifts period does that mean within the body of Believers that's gathered in oh okay I got it I got it see I'm like brother Brown say oh I got man got it I like one do you remember that when that brother random answered and the lady was definitely talking about nursing a baby I mean definitely talking about nursing the baby he said yeah it's good to nurse you need to go out to the hospitals and help people she was talking about nursing a baby it's in there somewhere you put he says oh yeah you it's really it's commendable that you want to go nurse he that that sister wasn't talking about that but that's okay that's a Humanity that we are that that uh um sometimes we discern wrong and we need we need everybody to discern right listen everybody has some sort of discernment in their life especially if you're a born again believer you have discernment to discern right from wrong listen listen you discerned in your soul that you were lost right that's the greatest thing that you knew you were lost and that you discerned that it wasn't the world that was going to save save you it was Jesus Christ that was going to save you all right then you come into the message and you said I can wear whatever I want to do I got to read the Bible and the Bible says do this and don't do that you got to discern right the church has gifts does that mean within the body of Believers that's gathered in the building or also outside individuals no well now there's gifts as the Bible says there's diversity of gifts there's people has gifts out in the world but they're not of God come on they're not of God you got these people that are that are um uh mediums and there are people that can help you out that does have a gift of wisdom but I'll promise you if they've never stepped over in the church they can't give you the right determination or the right discernment if they don't know anything about if you're talking about your spiritual life you can't go talk to to a prostitute about it that's pretty blunt but that's true why would you go well I'm going to go to a prostitute and ask him about my spiritual life no you need to ask him about their spiritual life that's right but you have a sister or a brother in the church or sisters and brothers in the church that have these nine spiritual gifts wisdom prophecy uh Faith all these different nine spiritual gifts go to them you're not going to hurt my feelings n right right but but now here's the whole thing like brother Dell's always said and brother Brown even says it too if somebody has a a question in the church all right now I don't mind if brother L got a question him and brother Bob get together they're ministers okay but if their decision that they come up with is different than what the pastor believes we got a problem right that's why brother Bram said pastor should be at every meeting between indiv between people in the church right why because sometimes we do get it wrong sometimes I get it wrong but we need to have that flow of information where what gets the church in in problem is is brother Donnie not just using you s you're biggest one in the place I'm going use you you and brother Anderson the next biggest person tallest person in the place y'all get together and say now now what brother wade mean when he said XYZ well I think he meant and I think he meant and I'm going to go talk to Brother Gary see what he thinks about what he meant well come to the man that said it and see what he meant that's right and if he can't tell you what he meant get rid of him that's why that you you shouldn't have secret meetings is that that's what brother Brown was talking about and even dad said the same thing you should never have a Deacon meeting you should never have a meeting between people and and discuss Doctrine as in what do you mean by this what do you mean by that no go to the go to the person that said it say hey what do you mean by this amen everybody good I didn't think we'd ever even get this at 4:30 but I I apologize but we got the questions answered if you got any more we'll do this maybe in um November's coming up I know it's jammed up everybody's got personal things to do and that's fine but we're still going to have uh first Sunday foot washing communion um and remember bring your money to give to
