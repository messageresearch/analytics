[15:08] house of the Lord you'd like turning
[15:10] your scriptures turn back where we've
[15:12] been reading in Hebrews
[15:13] 11 and try to continue our thought for a
[15:17] little while and then play a tape there
[15:20] from the super
[15:21] sense preached in 59 and is let the
[15:25] prophet say all of the things at one
[15:27] time on the best that we can do
[15:30] now sister
[15:34] uh Julie said that if we'd take a prayer
[15:39] cloth and pass them about that they
[15:41] would try to you know and I've sent two
[15:44] one for brother Mark and one for sister
[15:46] Jeff so just take them and pass them
[15:49] among you say a little prayer let it go
[15:51] all the way down come around make sure
[15:54] don't get it stopped just whisper a
[15:56] prayer and uh we'll send it to them to
[15:59] show them that we are with them and
[16:02] praying that the Lord would will take
[16:04] care of everything and we believe it
[16:06] because he is God and he changes not so
[16:09] just you know do that for brother Mark
[16:12] Jeff there and we pray to you know
[16:15] everything is
[16:17] well good to see everybody in the house
[16:19] of the Lord I I hope we welcomed
[16:21] everybody this morning I got to thinking
[16:24] about it did we well say welcome to you
[16:26] anyway so you know we're we're glad to
[16:30] you know see you in the house of the
[16:31] Lord and everything and I did wonder did
[16:35] I welcome brother Lewis and his family I
[16:38] didn't know where I did or not so
[16:41] welcome that's best way to say it
[16:43] welcome you know that's the best thing
[16:46] anybody can say when you can say welcome
[16:48] that's really a good point right well
[16:51] let's just get right into our thought
[16:53] and we'll try to uh bring this to a
[16:56] conclusion today on this part now not be
[16:59] out of Hebrews we'll be still in that
[17:01] because we're still on the positive
[17:05] attitude you know and like I've said
[17:08] anybody in the Bible that ever amounted
[17:10] anything had a positive attitude so
[17:12] that's what we're trying to speak about
[17:14] is a positive attitude and you know for
[17:17] you and I what for everybody else is
[17:20] wonderful but we got to have something
[17:22] for ourselves so let's just pray and go
[17:25] right on into the
[17:27] service Lord Jesus we thank you we love
[17:31] you we thank you for your grace and your
[17:33] guidance unto us and we just ask you to
[17:36] help us and Lord as we read your word
[17:39] you come and speak to our hearts and we
[17:41] realize that in speaking that a lot of
[17:44] times our human words are inadequate to
[17:47] be able to
[17:49] express what's really even Upon Our
[17:52] Hearts to talk to the people but we do
[17:54] the best we can we ask you to just open
[17:57] our eyes that we may see you and to come
[18:00] and walk in the light of your love
[18:03] father forgive us we know cuz we are
[18:05] human
[18:06] Mortals we have many problems and
[18:09] troubles and heartaches but yet we know
[18:12] one who will take care of all things we
[18:14] ask you to be with each one of these
[18:15] that are sick we're glad Brother Gary
[18:18] there's back with us this afternoon we
[18:20] pray that you would just touch him and
[18:22] open up those things in his valves in
[18:25] his heart or I mean his lungs or
[18:27] whatever it is is closing the problem
[18:30] and we pray that you would just let
[18:32] everything be well we love you and we
[18:34] thank you guide us now and keep us in
[18:38] Jesus name
[18:41] amen Hebrews
[18:46] 11 now Faith is the substance of things
[18:49] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[18:51] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[18:54] good
[18:55] report through faith we understand that
[18:57] the worlds were framed by the the word
[18:58] of God so that things which are seen
[19:01] were not made of things which do appear
[19:05] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[19:07] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[19:09] he obtained witness that he was
[19:11] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[19:14] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[19:18] faith Enoch was translated that he
[19:20] should not see death and was not found
[19:24] because God had translated him for
[19:27] before his TR translation he had this
[19:29] testimony that he pleased God but
[19:32] without faith it is impossible to please
[19:34] him for he that cometh to God must
[19:36] believe that he is and that he is a
[19:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[19:42] Him you may be seated the Lord add his
[19:45] Blessing to the word so just make sure
[19:47] now that the prayer claws get around to
[19:50] everybody and let everybody uh pray over
[19:55] them and uh do
[19:59] now I pray that you understanding what
[20:03] I'm trying to
[20:04] say
[20:07] um I always always say whether you
[20:09] believe it or not I want you to know
[20:12] what I believe and the way I believe it
[20:15] and then in doing that then uh you know
[20:19] I I can wait and see and and hope that
[20:23] something will come out of it but we
[20:26] were we've been talking about faith and
[20:28] this morning especially when we got into
[20:30] talking about faith being the six
[20:33] sense all right and that six sense is
[20:37] greater than all of the
[20:39] five because we we know that the five
[20:43] senses is only to touch this world or
[20:46] contact this world but God gave us
[20:49] another sense to be able to contact
[20:51] him and we've covered how that even a
[20:56] sinner can be healed
[20:59] a sinner can be
[21:01] saved you know because that's God is
[21:05] able to enter into the soul of mankind
[21:10] to where that he can bring forth you
[21:14] know from that inner being part of us
[21:17] that is wonderful now just because a
[21:19] sinner can be healed doesn't save
[21:22] them that's that's the point we've
[21:24] always tried to make and see then the
[21:27] even the old test
[21:28] Saints they had their salvation for
[21:31] their day and their time and it was the
[21:33] blood of bulls and goats and things but
[21:36] it could not bring the life of Jesus
[21:39] Christ into them and and all and you
[21:42] know and we've been through that where
[21:43] that the animal life had no soul could
[21:46] come back upon the
[21:48] believer so thereby It could only be
[21:51] faith for that time that they lived and
[21:55] and be for them but yet there was a
[21:58] Salvation for them as their belief was
[22:00] in the the blood of the bulls and goats
[22:03] as of what God Said right and then
[22:06] coming into the New Testament we move
[22:09] into a different situation entirely
[22:13] because now we've moved into the
[22:15] position that we you know they did on
[22:17] the day of Pentecost
[22:19] that we canot just be uh Sons and
[22:23] Daughters by creation or the children of
[22:26] God or whatever you want to call
[22:28] servants but we can actually be Sons and
[22:31] Daughters of God by spiritual creation
[22:35] by the new birth to where that we can
[22:38] can say that it's not I Paul said that
[22:41] live but Christ that liveth in me all
[22:44] right now then that way I live by the
[22:47] faith of the Son of God as he said all
[22:50] right see then Faith to a
[22:52] Christian see that new birth puts us
[22:55] into a different
[22:56] real a dimension as we read this morning
[23:00] uh you know to where that we enter
[23:02] therein resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[23:04] places in Christ Jesus all right and
[23:08] that gives our soul eternal life so it
[23:11] places within us the six
[23:13] sense and it's just not a believing unto
[23:17] I've got one quote where I was reading
[23:20] where brother R said Abraham had it
[23:23] potentially we'll review a little bit
[23:25] Wednesday and then go on with the
[23:27] questions
[23:28] answers but see back then it could only
[23:31] be in a potential
[23:33] form because Christ had not come and
[23:36] died to give his life so there was no
[23:39] way that Holy Ghost could enter there in
[23:42] had it entered in to the man before it
[23:46] had driven out the unclean Spirit look
[23:48] what a situation would be and see even
[23:52] in the New Testament God will not dwell
[23:55] in an unclean vessel so he has to drive
[23:59] out that unclean spirit before he can
[24:01] come into to give new birth to the
[24:04] individual all right now that should be
[24:07] uh clear to all of us and we should
[24:10] follow it but what I want to hold a
[24:13] point this
[24:14] afternoon and then we'll listen to the
[24:16] tape part of showing is
[24:19] that as we read this morning where
[24:22] brother Brandon said there's only one
[24:24] class of
[24:26] people that has really that six
[24:30] sense he said that's the Believers
[24:33] amen a born again believer then enters a
[24:37] real to live in that real right our
[24:40] problem is is we do as we quoted this
[24:43] morning that the prophet said where we
[24:46] fail in the garden we fail in those
[24:49] reasoning factors in things you know to
[24:52] the point of the C test fa smell and
[24:55] here because it all worked no matter if
[24:57] it was within in a spiritual sense it
[25:00] still had to come outward into those
[25:04] five senses and we could you know then
[25:07] Eve could see she could hear you know
[25:11] all of the things could go into
[25:14] motion but we know too that we covered
[25:17] that the prophet saying it like this
[25:19] that man is to
[25:22] be controlled in the natural by those
[25:26] five senses you know our lives and if
[25:29] one of them is not working then we're
[25:32] not into full control all right but that
[25:35] then when that sick sense comes in it
[25:39] comes in to abide within us and control
[25:43] us all right dominate
[25:48] us bring us to a place until we
[25:52] can be what God wants us to be all right
[25:57] in that that Rim all
[25:59] right then we got down kind of to the
[26:02] last part where he said it like this he
[26:05] said is praying I think it is and he
[26:09] said Lord wake up this six
[26:13] sense you know we have
[26:16] it we have it if we have the new birth
[26:20] we have that sick sense within us but we
[26:23] can let it become so uh dormant whatever
[26:27] you want to call it
[26:28] lifeless uh you know so uh not let it in
[26:33] full
[26:35] control until it becomes to a place that
[26:38] is hard for God to contact
[26:41] us because he contacts us through that
[26:44] six sense all right and then when he
[26:47] does then that puts us to a place that
[26:50] see we need to have that one inside of
[26:55] us woke up and we were listening to a
[26:57] tape the other night and even though
[26:59] brother R him and said you know he
[27:01] preached a message called U gowake Jesus
[27:04] was for
[27:05] one but he he's he's quoting something I
[27:09] forgot how that it brought out but he
[27:11] said why do we want to wake him
[27:15] up he said he's not supposed to be
[27:18] asleep and I thought well you know
[27:21] that's a good way of putting it he's not
[27:23] supposed to be asleep he's supposed to
[27:25] be awake anyway all right
[27:28] all right now but let's get into the
[27:30] point of dealing with you and I as
[27:34] Christians bring us over into our
[27:36] thoughts into the New
[27:39] Testament and in the New Testament we
[27:41] still have the condition of where that
[27:46] uh a sinner can receive
[27:49] healing it can be revealed to them that
[27:51] they're healed uh things gifts can
[27:54] operate in Sinners remember there were
[27:57] without repentance and they can operate
[27:59] and they can see things and different
[28:02] things but yet the real sick
[28:07] sense that only comes by the new
[28:11] birth and that should put you and I in a
[28:13] place to at
[28:16] least you know think
[28:20] about what we're here
[28:22] far and we're not here to just
[28:25] haphazardly play along and be good
[28:27] Christians and go to church you know and
[28:31] live and die and
[28:33] just you
[28:35] know we're here for a
[28:38] purpose and I believe this end time
[28:41] bride is here for the purpose of one
[28:44] thing for that that six sense can be
[28:47] woke up and we can learn to uh deal in
[28:52] that six sense more I believe that's
[28:55] what these virtues are for am I I
[28:58] believe this is what the faith virtue
[28:59] knowledge Temperance patience call you
[29:01] know love joy peace goodness meekness
[29:03] long suff all of those things the nine
[29:06] spiritual gifts and is in the body of
[29:10] Christ but we need it to be open up and
[29:14] he even said if I can remember it to
[29:16] find it in
[29:17] here he says that we just put the six
[29:22] sense form onto healing and things but
[29:26] see it's for everything
[29:29] you know it should be our daily
[29:32] thing and I know we're human God knows
[29:35] we're human you don't have to explain to
[29:38] him you're human but I do all the time
[29:40] don't you you know I mean I I really try
[29:44] to tell him Lord now you know you live
[29:45] like I did so you know but you know the
[29:49] point we don't have to explain it to him
[29:52] he
[29:54] knows but yet what we need to do
[29:56] sometimes is is to let
[29:58] ourselves be to the place that we can
[30:02] constantly believe
[30:05] him and I I like the quotes the prophet
[30:09] would make about a
[30:11] Christian
[30:13] and he said who was it
[30:16] uh
[30:17] Joshua he said he didn't have to pray up
[30:20] to stop the
[30:22] sun he said he's prayed up for the
[30:24] foundation of the world all right
[30:28] now if he was what about Born Again
[30:31] Believers okay now that's the point now
[30:35] I I'll get to a lot later on is us to
[30:38] think of things more positive instead of
[30:41] so negative because naturally the first
[30:44] thing you do I mean you get down to pray
[30:46] for somebody and the devil says you
[30:48] ain't
[30:49] worthy now he don't talk to you that way
[30:52] if he
[30:54] don't pray that he'll move off of me
[30:56] sometimes get on to you and I don't mean
[30:59] that wrong I just mean that he does that
[31:03] to all of
[31:04] us and you'll start and you think you're
[31:06] doing pretty good and you're feeling
[31:08] pretty good and you you you're getting
[31:10] ready to pray and about the time you're
[31:12] getting ready to
[31:14] pray the phone
[31:18] rings
[31:19] right something goes
[31:22] wrong you
[31:25] know and you know I listened to brother
[31:28] randam and what he's saying here's a
[31:30] prophet and he said get out in the woods
[31:31] and be praying before service he said
[31:34] get down to pray and he says to the
[31:36] briers or you know leaves he said
[31:39] sticking my knees and hurting
[31:42] them he said then I get to pray and move
[31:45] over a little and he said the mosquitoes
[31:48] come now here's a prophet you know but
[31:52] he's just
[31:54] honest he said I just get up and and
[31:57] start praying anyway you
[32:00] know what about a man that says is so in
[32:03] contact with God until he can speak the
[32:05] word as he did but he'd say I had to get
[32:09] in my car and ride down
[32:12] through Kentucky somewhere up to there
[32:14] he said Indiana he says to get in the
[32:18] spirit of the
[32:20] Lord and I think if I done that I'd be
[32:24] 25,000 miles around the Earth I'd make
[32:26] about three trips trying to get you know
[32:29] in the point of being able to
[32:32] pray but what is my point my point is
[32:36] one thing let's don't make something so
[32:39] big and so great until there's no one
[32:44] that would have the ability to reach
[32:46] unto
[32:48] it and I'm not talking about sinful
[32:52] lives we should be
[32:55] repentant to get rid rid of that and
[32:57] keep that part clean I'm talking about
[33:00] believing
[33:04] God that we should go every day and
[33:06] thinking Lord what do you want me to
[33:10] do what do you want me to do Lord might
[33:14] change a lot of
[33:15] things for us to do a lot of praying
[33:18] about what we're
[33:20] doing then you've heard stories told I
[33:23] was going this way and for some unknown
[33:25] reason I just turned went the other way
[33:28] and come find out there was a wreck on
[33:29] that
[33:32] road I believe in predestination if I
[33:35] was going to go it would have got me
[33:37] anyway if you believe in
[33:39] predestination you better believe in
[33:41] that little nod telling you go the other
[33:44] way
[33:46] right you better listen to that if
[33:49] you're going to talk about
[33:50] predestination because that might save
[33:52] you some trouble along the way all right
[33:57] but now think about
[34:00] it only the
[34:04] Christian there only one class of people
[34:08] that can really rest in the six sense
[34:11] and that's the Born Again believer
[34:14] because the six sense is not
[34:16] something and I hope I can get this
[34:18] point it's not something out
[34:22] yonder right see that would be C field
[34:25] smells in years you
[34:29] it's within
[34:32] you it's not out somewhere else it's
[34:34] within you brother R said we have our
[34:37] Resurrection
[34:39] where he says inside of
[34:43] us where's the change of the body going
[34:46] to come
[34:47] from well one of these days a bus is
[34:50] going to pull up you know
[34:55] no don't come from the end inside
[34:58] out all right so we're trying to get to
[35:01] see what really faith
[35:05] is and I know that when I ask the
[35:09] question that sometimes you say well why
[35:11] does he keep saying that but has God
[35:14] ever really dealt with you until you
[35:17] know
[35:19] yourself that it was God and God Alone
[35:22] dealing with
[35:24] you well I've never had that brother
[35:29] but yet think back through your
[35:32] life uh brother I can't remember his
[35:35] name but I remember brother Zer knew the
[35:38] man and talked with him and some way one
[35:42] man told the other one anyhow brother
[35:44] randam had told this man
[35:46] said he was coming from one place to
[35:49] another the Jeffersonville he said the
[35:51] devil fought you all the way
[35:55] here no brother I believe it's brother
[35:58] Zer pretty sure you know he went and
[36:00] talked to the man and he knew him he
[36:02] said did you feel any different he said
[36:04] no I got in the car and drove to
[36:06] Jefferson
[36:09] Bill there's a lot of difference in the
[36:11] story right the way we
[36:15] think but what was in that man's way all
[36:18] the way that got took care
[36:22] of the Prophet said the devil fought you
[36:24] all the way
[36:28] see think about the simple things of
[36:32] life you and I ever
[36:35] day are supposed to be walking in a six
[36:40] sense and I will admit to you and I wish
[36:44] I had more contact with
[36:47] it I wish I had as much contact with a
[36:50] sick senses I do the
[36:53] five
[36:55] right but still
[36:58] the Bible didn't
[36:59] say I'll be with you
[37:02] always it doesn't say
[37:06] that it says I'll be with you all
[37:12] way that's what it says always is
[37:17] meaning whenever it is necessary for me
[37:20] to be there to help you always is never
[37:24] leaving
[37:25] you
[37:27] right but all way is just when he's
[37:31] needed to be there he don't need to be
[37:33] on the moon today because as far as I
[37:35] know there not anybody up
[37:37] there he don't even have to be there to
[37:42] record but you think about it now so
[37:46] let's just get a few quotes and then
[37:47] we'll we'll get on with it I go with
[37:50] number we jumped over we got over to
[37:53] number
[37:55] 15 and all of these quotes would be
[37:58] relating
[37:59] to the new birth
[38:02] to you cannot have the six sense without
[38:05] the new birth and and the things and
[38:08] you'll see that it's relating to you and
[38:11] I okay this is a message
[38:14] Serv we would see Jesus paragraph or
[38:18] page
[38:22] 14 now listen to what your Prophet this
[38:25] one really caught my
[38:28] attention and we believe him to be a
[38:31] prophet but read this read it with me
[38:34] look CU he's talking to a lady about
[38:38] something and she says well well we
[38:41] never live back there and we never seen
[38:44] him see we didn't see God like they saw
[38:47] him look what he
[38:50] said and I have seen
[38:52] him and I said thing of it is I thought
[38:59] Lord now I'm before two great smart
[39:04] churches now you've got to give me
[39:07] wisdom so then I heard
[39:10] myself go to
[39:14] Talking I want you to examine
[39:17] it never thought of it in my
[39:23] life I said man today has to be like he
[39:26] was then because he's the same man he's
[39:30] made up for five senses and if he stood
[39:33] and looked at him right in the
[39:36] face he still he would still have to
[39:40] have that sick sense of Faith to believe
[39:44] him no matter what he looked like he'd
[39:48] have to believe him
[39:50] anyhow when I come across that one I
[39:52] thought it's running six cents in your
[39:54] computer and you got days of searching
[39:57] of the things he
[39:58] said but he said Lord I need it and he
[40:02] said I never thought of it he said then
[40:06] the Lord speaks to him and
[40:08] says that man is the same
[40:12] today he's the same man we're made up of
[40:16] five senses just like Noah
[40:18] was but what's the difference in
[40:22] us what's the difference in us and Noah
[40:26] now to an unregenerated person there's
[40:29] not a bit of difference just because
[40:32] we're born in the New Testament don't
[40:34] give us a new
[40:37] birth it's the same
[40:40] people all right but that six
[40:43] sense when it comes in and that's what
[40:46] he's saying so no matter how much
[40:48] anybody can do it but if he don't have
[40:50] that six sense he can never see
[40:53] it what a wonderful opportunity to be
[40:56] able to see and see God you don't never
[40:59] thank him for
[41:01] that look at the next one that super
[41:04] sense we'll hear this in a minute where
[41:06] he says may the super sense May the
[41:09] sense of faith that belongs to the
[41:12] believer because he has to have it in
[41:14] order to believe Lord give us more of it
[41:17] oh Purge it Lord and try us fill us thy
[41:21] goodness and thy power let us walk it
[41:24] walk all the days of our life by the six
[41:27] sense by the six sense that's only given
[41:31] by Jesus
[41:37] Christ the new birth is only given by
[41:39] Jesus
[41:41] Christ because he goes on to paragraph
[41:43] 53 for the same
[41:47] message he's given your to contact you
[41:51] but there was given a six sense and that
[41:53] six sense belongs only to the
[41:59] Christian and you cannot have this six
[42:03] sense until you become a
[42:06] Christian it is the only way that you
[42:08] can ever have any more than the five
[42:12] natural
[42:13] senses for the natural
[42:16] person but six sense is better known to
[42:20] Christians as
[42:23] Faith the Christians now all
[42:27] right jump over now
[42:30] to number 20 we'll try to get this one
[42:33] and then we'll get on with the
[42:36] message this is paragraph 60 of the
[42:38] super sense you'll hear him say in a
[42:41] minute he says you cannot believe it
[42:44] until you're
[42:47] regenerated the Bible said that no man
[42:49] can call Jesus the Christ only by the
[42:52] Holy Ghost we went through that you know
[42:54] and he said people didn't understand him
[42:56] especially Pentecostal people he says
[42:59] you're only taking what somebody else
[43:01] said what you learn by
[43:04] intellectual what you learn by the
[43:06] natural five
[43:09] senses but when the six sense comes in
[43:12] the Holy
[43:14] Spirit is he telling you what the six
[43:16] sense is the holy spirit it takes away
[43:19] all the
[43:20] reasonings of these six and five senses
[43:24] and lifts you up into that six sense
[43:27] make you believe things that you can't
[43:29] see taste feeli smelling here does
[43:31] something to you then you can say Jesus
[43:34] is the
[43:35] Christ because you have witnessed
[43:38] it not by intellectual teaching has
[43:42] taught
[43:43] you but what you've
[43:46] experienced don't you you follow with me
[43:51] now in this dispensation in this part
[43:54] where we're talking of a sinner can
[43:57] receive healing
[44:01] right a person can receive salvation
[44:05] right you know that's
[44:07] lost but the main thing is the six sense
[44:12] of the new birth which is
[44:15] Faith all right and when that
[44:19] speaks that's the part of you that
[44:22] speaks to tell you like I said this
[44:25] morning when I had it all figured
[44:28] out I had it all written
[44:33] down I was ready to preach
[44:38] something and something said you make
[44:41] your Tope greater than your anti
[44:44] top so s up burn it
[44:48] see all right have you ever had
[44:51] something to just tell
[44:54] you
[44:56] if you ever really had a
[45:00] revelation that God is
[45:05] real or is it just what we had when we
[45:08] was an organized religion or that they
[45:10] have an organized religion an
[45:12] imagination a
[45:18] concept then you think they can take a
[45:20] trinity and deprogram
[45:23] you into believing in three gods
[45:30] I'm going to
[45:32] hurt and I mean for it to
[45:35] hurt because when you get hurt at least
[45:38] you'll do something about it you'll
[45:39] either get up and leave or you will do
[45:42] something about it how can you swallow
[45:45] all of these doctrines that's in the
[45:46] message that are carrying you to another
[45:54] God and yet you say you can't be
[45:59] deprogrammed I mean you're still
[46:01] wondering whether there's two Souls Two
[46:04] Lords River Jordans whether Jesus was
[46:08] God or
[46:13] not the biggest portion of the people
[46:16] are already deprogrammed and don't know
[46:23] it I'm sorry but is it the
[46:26] truth if you take you to another
[46:30] God and another God is our
[46:33] thoughts or ideas contrary to God's
[46:41] word see the biggest portion of people
[46:43] ain't got to worry about being
[46:45] deprogrammed they're already
[46:47] deprogrammed or maybe they never was
[46:50] programmed that would be one way of
[46:52] saying
[46:54] it
[46:57] that's why I fight so hard against
[47:01] doctrines because I know the human mind
[47:04] loves to play with new
[47:08] ideas you remember Mars
[47:12] Hill they loved a new
[47:15] thing a new
[47:18] doctrine they wanted to hear something
[47:24] new but I want you to listen to the
[47:28] prophet and listen even to some of the
[47:30] things that he
[47:32] says and I want you to think about your
[47:35] own
[47:36] self you'll hear in two incidences
[47:40] speaking of when he walked up to a wreck
[47:44] and there was the kid was crying or the
[47:47] person in the car don't move the car
[47:49] you'll break my
[47:51] back he walks
[47:54] around and he said that six sense came
[47:57] on the scene and said the car flipped
[47:59] back
[48:05] over talk to another about a woman you
[48:07] don't do
[48:12] it but just think about it God is trying
[48:16] to get you and I to see who we
[48:19] are that's what this message came
[48:24] for let's go ahead we'll we'll play the
[48:26] tape and then we'll get back and how the
[48:30] communion the foot washing once he
[48:33] finishes go ahead brother I guess we we
[48:35] have to turn out the
[48:38] lights I don't know where we'll have
[48:41] to I got the background all right give
[48:45] this to Sister Julie book of
[48:47] Hebrews and the 11th chapter just for a
[48:51] a short message being a little horse but
[48:56] I had a wonderful afternoon with
[48:59] Brethren and sisters and never got in
[49:02] till almost 6
[49:04] o' and I just run into the room and
[49:07] knelt down at the side of the bed at the
[49:09] bedroom and prayed for a few moments got
[49:12] up and picked up my Bible and started to
[49:15] read and I seen a magazine laying there
[49:18] and I picked it up and it was wrote in
[49:20] africant so I couldn't read that and
[49:23] sometimes in reading you'll strike a
[49:25] word
[49:26] and that word becomes alive to you
[49:29] that's way a minister gets his his
[49:30] message just start reading reading the
[49:33] Bible something first thing you know you
[49:35] strike something then something adds to
[49:38] that something something adds to that
[49:39] something then underline it and just go
[49:42] to the pulpit and read it God will do
[49:44] the rest of it you'll take care of the
[49:46] rest
[49:49] now sometimes you get so carried away to
[49:51] you make little thoughts of what little
[49:53] notes of thoughts that you thought
[49:56] sometimes in a meeting where you have to
[49:57] come quickly to the platform that just
[50:00] read over them little thoughts that you
[50:02] had maybe the Holy Spirit Will quick
[50:03] them to you again done that many's a
[50:06] time now Hebrews 11 let's read the first
[50:12] verse beginning and we'll read quite a
[50:15] few
[50:18] verses now Faith is the substance of
[50:21] things hoped
[50:22] for the evidence of Things Not Seen seen
[50:26] far by it the elders obtained a good
[50:29] report through faith we understand that
[50:32] the worlds were framed by the word of
[50:37] God so that things which are seen were
[50:41] not made of things which do
[50:44] appear isn't that
[50:47] Rich let me read that third verse again
[50:50] listen
[50:51] closely through faith we understand that
[50:54] the world were framed by the word of
[50:59] God so that things which are seen were
[51:04] not made of things which do appear is
[51:07] the word of
[51:09] God by faith able offered unto God a
[51:13] more excellent sacrifice than
[51:17] Cain by which he obtained witness that
[51:20] he was righteous God testifying of his
[51:24] gifts
[51:26] and by it being dead yet
[51:30] spake by faith Enoch was translated that
[51:34] he should not see death and was not
[51:38] found because God translated
[51:41] him far before his translation he had a
[51:45] testimony that he pleased
[51:48] God 500 years of life
[51:53] too but without faith it is impossible
[51:57] to please
[51:58] him for he that cometh to God must
[52:02] believe that he is and that he is a
[52:06] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[52:10] Him by faith Noah being warned of God
[52:14] are things not seen as yet moved with
[52:18] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[52:22] his
[52:23] house by which he condemned the world
[52:27] and became heir of righteousness which
[52:30] is by which is by
[52:36] faith now let us pray just a moment and
[52:39] bow our
[52:44] heads Lord our most gracious God and
[52:52] Father we come now into thy presence
[52:55] again with
[52:58] Thanksgiving and not only are we now
[53:02] feeling that we are in thy presence
[53:04] because that we have bowed our heads to
[53:07] pray but we believe that we are
[53:11] constantly in thy
[53:15] presence because that the eyes of the
[53:18] Lord run to and fro through the
[53:21] Earth and you know all
[53:24] things and you know the thoughts of the
[53:28] heart therefore Lord the reason we bow
[53:31] our heads is to ask this
[53:34] petition that you would forgive us for
[53:37] all of our trespasses and transgressions
[53:40] against
[53:41] thee and that thy mercy once more would
[53:45] be extended to us in so much that you'd
[53:48] open our lips to speak and our ears to
[53:52] hear and that Thy word might become real
[53:55] to us
[53:57] tonight that these few verses that we
[54:00] have chosen to read might become a great
[54:04] help to every member of thy mythical
[54:08] body on the earth thy spiritual church
[54:12] the church of the first
[54:14] born that church that's been bought by
[54:18] the blood of Jesus that's been washed
[54:21] and has been Sanctified and will be
[54:25] presented to God that day without a
[54:28] blemish or a
[54:31] wrinkle how we thank thee to have faith
[54:35] to believe that we are partakers of this
[54:38] goodness of God through the
[54:40] righteousness and mercy of our Lord
[54:44] Jesus praying now that you will heal all
[54:47] the sickness thanking you for touching
[54:50] that little girl just a few moments ago
[54:53] Lin doubled in the room in that there
[54:55] from
[54:56] Pain see her walk out that little
[54:59] childlike faith and accepting you and
[55:02] your
[55:04] mercy and we thank thee for this and
[55:07] pray that you'll remember Sister Baker's
[55:11] little loved one over in Kentucky and
[55:15] the ones that brother Neville spoke of
[55:17] and oh God the innumerable Camp of the
[55:22] sick
[55:24] everywhere
[55:25] and especially Lord those that are
[55:28] unsaved and Know Thee not if they should
[55:31] die in their sins they cannot come where
[55:34] you
[55:35] are we pray that you'll give us witness
[55:38] and power boldness to speak the word and
[55:41] wisdom to know when to speak
[55:44] it and then speak to us when we have
[55:47] said enough that we might walk away and
[55:50] leave the people in the amazement
[55:53] wandering of the great Holy Spirit in
[55:56] his work granted Lord hear us now we
[56:00] pray in Jesus name we ask it
[56:07] amen I would like to speak just far a
[56:11] short time upon the subject of
[56:18] Senses we are taught that the natural
[56:21] man has five senses in those five senses
[56:26] control his his or give God gave him
[56:32] these five senses to
[56:35] contact his Earthly
[56:38] home and those senses are known as see
[56:42] taste feel smell
[56:45] hear those five senses which are known
[56:48] to the Natural
[56:51] man and they are good
[56:55] and we
[56:57] cannot operate or live a normal
[57:01] life when one of these senses fail to
[57:04] act your sight hearing feeling smelling
[57:08] or
[57:09] tasting we cannot be normal without them
[57:13] there's something
[57:15] missing some potion of life that we
[57:18] cannot contact without that sense
[57:23] acting and there good and they're
[57:26] useful and they were given to us by
[57:30] God God gave those
[57:35] senses but they're given to you as a
[57:41] gift and it depends on how you what you
[57:45] yield these senses
[57:47] to will be the way that your life is
[57:52] controlled the way you yield those five
[57:56] senses your what you see what you hear
[58:01] what you taste smell or
[58:05] feel whatever those senses are yielded
[58:08] to they will dominate
[58:12] you and we are grateful to God that we
[58:16] have the five
[58:18] senses but by no means was these five
[58:23] senses given given to you to guide
[58:28] you they were given to you for Earthly
[58:34] contact but there was giv you the six
[58:39] sense and that six sense is belongs only
[58:45] to the
[58:48] Christian and you cannot have this six
[58:51] sense until you become a
[58:56] Christian is the only way that you can
[58:59] ever have any more than the five natural
[59:03] senses for the natural
[59:06] person but six sense is better known to
[59:10] the Christian as
[59:13] Faith it's the one that governs and
[59:17] guides you and it is superior to all the
[59:22] other
[59:23] senses
[59:25] it's a
[59:26] superior to all of the senses the other
[59:31] five
[59:32] senses now I would not say that because
[59:36] that we receive the six
[59:40] sense that the five senses are no good
[59:43] no more yes they are those five senses
[59:48] were given to you by
[59:50] God and they are to be
[59:53] used but
[59:55] when the five
[59:58] senses act contrary to the word of God
[1:00:02] then they are
[1:00:06] lying now the six sense cannot
[1:00:10] lie it's a super
[1:00:14] sense and that's what I want to speak
[1:00:16] about this morning I spoke on a super
[1:00:20] sign and tonight on a super
[1:00:23] sense
[1:00:25] and the super sense is the Holy Spirit
[1:00:30] the faith of God that dwells in
[1:00:34] you and if you
[1:00:38] let the five senses be yielded to the
[1:00:42] six sense it'll guide you and bring all
[1:00:46] the other five senses under control of
[1:00:50] that super sense for it's so far above
[1:00:54] the natural sense as a spiritual man is
[1:00:58] above the
[1:00:59] natural it's as far and as high as the
[1:01:02] heavens is above the natural man and his
[1:01:07] five
[1:01:10] senses it makes you believe things that
[1:01:12] you cannot
[1:01:14] see it makes you act where you do not
[1:01:17] think the five senses would ever think
[1:01:20] about
[1:01:21] it the devil can get into these senses
[1:01:25] and lie to
[1:01:27] you but he cannot touch that super
[1:01:31] sense that's far beyond his
[1:01:35] reach that come from
[1:01:39] God it's called
[1:01:43] faith faith is that great
[1:01:48] thing
[1:01:50] and the five senses does not control the
[1:01:54] six sense but the six sense controls the
[1:01:57] five
[1:01:59] senses the super sense controls the
[1:02:02] natural
[1:02:04] senses and the the five senses is C
[1:02:10] taste feel smell here and the super
[1:02:13] sense is something that'll make you
[1:02:15] believe God's word for that's the only
[1:02:17] thing it'll speak
[1:02:19] about and it'll make you believe for
[1:02:22] things that you can't see taste feels
[1:02:24] smell
[1:02:25] here because it'll take God's word and
[1:02:29] it will deliver that word to you and
[1:02:33] make you walk contrary to any other
[1:02:37] thing there is but God's
[1:02:39] word by faith faith does
[1:02:44] it now in giving this
[1:02:48] illustration of the senses the natural
[1:02:51] man is borned with these senses so they
[1:02:54] are nature given
[1:02:57] senses and that's really only thing
[1:02:59] he'll ever know about it in his
[1:03:02] intellectual thinking he can only think
[1:03:05] as a man he can see as a
[1:03:09] man he can understand as a man you hear
[1:03:13] as a
[1:03:14] man but when he becomes governed are
[1:03:20] regenerated or we would call it borned
[1:03:23] again
[1:03:25] then that sick super sense takes a hold
[1:03:28] of
[1:03:31] him doing so that super sense raises him
[1:03:36] up into a spot that where he has Faith
[1:03:39] to believe things that he could not hear
[1:03:42] things that he could not see
[1:03:45] understandings that he could not
[1:03:46] understand he believes in anyhow because
[1:03:48] he's governed by that six
[1:03:51] sense that super sense
[1:03:56] oh how marvelous it
[1:03:59] is to know it and to think how simple it
[1:04:05] is to believe it now you cannot believe
[1:04:09] it until you are
[1:04:12] regenerated the Bible said that no man
[1:04:15] can call Jesus the Christ only by the
[1:04:17] Holy
[1:04:19] Ghost we went through that this last
[1:04:22] week and SP such a stumbling block
[1:04:25] especially to the Pentecostal believing
[1:04:29] people when they hear me say that Jesus
[1:04:32] said in Saint John 5:24 he that Hearth
[1:04:36] my word and believeth on him that sent
[1:04:38] me has eternal
[1:04:40] life eternal life comes from God
[1:04:45] alone and no man can say Jesus is the
[1:04:48] Christ only by the Holy Ghost you're
[1:04:52] only taking what somebody else said what
[1:04:55] you learn by
[1:04:56] intellectual what you learn by the
[1:04:58] natural five
[1:05:00] senses but when the six sense comes in
[1:05:03] the Holy Spirit it takes away all the
[1:05:06] reasonings of these six senses and five
[1:05:08] senses and lifts you up into that six
[1:05:10] sense to make you believe things that
[1:05:12] you can't see taste feel
[1:05:16] smell does something to you then you can
[1:05:20] say Jesus is the Christ because you have
[1:05:22] witnessed it
[1:05:25] not what intellectual teaching has
[1:05:26] taught you but what you've
[1:05:31] experienced what is the six cense to do
[1:05:34] then brother brandom why did the six
[1:05:36] Sense come the six Sense come for this
[1:05:40] reason now six sense is the faith the
[1:05:43] super
[1:05:44] sense now if the six Sense come for this
[1:05:48] reason only that was to make the five
[1:05:52] senses in you deny anything that's
[1:05:56] contrary to God's word amenu that's what
[1:05:59] the six senses
[1:06:01] part the scripture speaks of casting
[1:06:04] down
[1:06:05] reasoning the the F five senses will you
[1:06:10] can reason well now why should this man
[1:06:14] why should but the six sense doesn't see
[1:06:16] that at all it's so far beyond it it's
[1:06:21] so much higher than it is until it don't
[1:06:25] even have any reasonings at all with it
[1:06:28] we believe
[1:06:30] it far beyond anything that the five
[1:06:34] senses would have to say about
[1:06:36] it now get ready for a healing
[1:06:41] service see we believe it you walk by
[1:06:46] that six
[1:06:47] sense you talk for that six sense you
[1:06:52] live for that six sense
[1:06:56] die by that six sense and rise for that
[1:06:59] six sense that super
[1:07:02] sense something that's in you that's
[1:07:04] different from what the natural man is
[1:07:07] the natural man only has these and
[1:07:09] they're all right if they can be brought
[1:07:12] in submission to the six
[1:07:15] Saint if the natural mind says reads the
[1:07:18] word of God and says that is the word of
[1:07:20] God is speaking the truth but if it
[1:07:22] reads and say it's not all the word of
[1:07:24] God or or it's was something it was one
[1:07:27] time but it isn't now then that six
[1:07:30] sense comes in and says he's the same
[1:07:32] yesterday today and forever
[1:07:35] amen see that's the
[1:07:37] difference that's why that's so many
[1:07:40] people fail to be
[1:07:43] healed they're trying to come with an
[1:07:46] intellectual
[1:07:48] conception they say oh I U I do this or
[1:07:53] I believe this and so forth but if that
[1:07:56] six sense is saying that then there's
[1:07:59] nothing will ever shake them from that
[1:08:01] six
[1:08:04] sense the six sense is come upon the
[1:08:08] human being to make them deny anything
[1:08:11] that's contrary to the word of
[1:08:14] God any
[1:08:16] symptom any symp that's contrary to
[1:08:19] God's promise the six sense says it
[1:08:21] isn't
[1:08:22] now
[1:08:26] if the Christian that's bned
[1:08:29] again and the first thing you know some
[1:08:31] Infidel unbeliever gets around to the
[1:08:34] Christian and said now look here there's
[1:08:37] no such a thing as that Holy Ghost
[1:08:39] you're just mistaken in that you're
[1:08:41] crazy if you believe such stuff as that
[1:08:44] there's no such a thing as it that six
[1:08:46] sense goes right straight to
[1:08:49] work let me show you in the Bible where
[1:08:52] you can't receive the Holy Ghost you see
[1:08:54] I can show here where the disciples got
[1:08:57] it but uh but I well you say look at the
[1:08:59] six cents of points you over say but he
[1:09:01] said the promise isn't to you to your
[1:09:03] children well that meant their children
[1:09:05] there that didn't mean for you it isn't
[1:09:07] for you but that six cense knows
[1:09:09] better why it's already in
[1:09:12] you they've said it too late you've
[1:09:15] already received
[1:09:19] it people who talk to through there's no
[1:09:21] such a thing as the Holy Spirit don't
[1:09:23] know what they're talking
[1:09:26] about like a boy once peeling an apple
[1:09:30] and was asked by an Infidel debating a
[1:09:32] meeting he said what do you want what do
[1:09:35] you want up here he said I want to ask
[1:09:37] you a question while he was eating the
[1:09:39] apple and enjoying it a very simple sort
[1:09:42] of a look like a delinquent person with
[1:09:45] the hair hanging in his face and one
[1:09:48] tooth out in front and an old dirty
[1:09:50] overhauled jacket on he said just one
[1:09:53] question I I want to ask you the Infidel
[1:09:56] just said there is no such a thing as
[1:09:58] God it's all emotion it's nonsense to it
[1:10:02] it's all it is and the boy said I want
[1:10:05] to ask you a question Mister is this
[1:10:07] apple sweeter
[1:10:09] sour he said how do I know I'm not
[1:10:11] eating it he said that's just what I
[1:10:13] thought walked right back how do you
[1:10:16] know when you haven't tasted the Lord
[1:10:19] how do you know when you've never
[1:10:21] received the Holy Ghost whether he's
[1:10:23] real or whether he is
[1:10:24] not how do you know where there's faith
[1:10:27] and power how do you know there's not
[1:10:29] joy unspeakable and full of Glory when
[1:10:32] you've never tasted the
[1:10:35] see the six sense leads you to that the
[1:10:39] six sense declares that to you there's
[1:10:42] no intellectual Powers at all will ever
[1:10:44] bring that to you the intellectual
[1:10:46] Powers will reason and say why it's
[1:10:48] psychology it's something this way it's
[1:10:50] emotion with the people but when the
[1:10:52] sick sense come in it denies all those
[1:10:55] things and moves a person straight into
[1:10:58] the bosoms of
[1:11:00] God he that cometh to God must believe
[1:11:03] that he is and a rewarder of those that
[1:11:06] diligently seek Him by Faith by faith
[1:11:11] Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob
[1:11:15] all by
[1:11:16] faith it's a six sense that does it six
[1:11:21] sense denies all Simpson all symptoms
[1:11:25] anything contrary to God's word any
[1:11:28] feeling emotion somebody say oh well I
[1:11:31] was prayed for but I just don't feel any
[1:11:36] better six sense would never stand still
[1:11:38] for
[1:11:40] that six senses say it's a lie I feel
[1:11:45] better I'm getting
[1:11:47] well God said so that settles it yes
[1:11:52] amen amen amen God said so six sense
[1:11:57] only feeds on the word of God that's
[1:11:59] super sense it's super above the senses
[1:12:03] it's a greater sense it's a faith it's a
[1:12:06] power that stars and
[1:12:11] drives
[1:12:13] amen it's something that makes you do
[1:12:15] things that you never thought you would
[1:12:17] do it's the six Saints the super Saints
[1:12:22] you get prayed for
[1:12:24] say you got got a hand you get
[1:12:25] prayed for your hand you come up there
[1:12:28] and you believe that God's going to heal
[1:12:29] you the pastor prays for you you go back
[1:12:32] the old natural man will say this you
[1:12:35] don't feel any different than that hand
[1:12:37] you're no better than what you ever was
[1:12:39] but the six sense comes along and say
[1:12:41] that's a
[1:12:43] lie you've been prayed for that settles
[1:12:48] it amen like a woman that come to a
[1:12:51] meeting one time and she come come here
[1:12:53] meeting two of them they crossed the
[1:12:56] platform they'd seen the
[1:12:58] discernments them women were just just
[1:13:01] swallowed up they were both real
[1:13:05] Christians one come up in the spirit
[1:13:08] came and said you are suffering with a
[1:13:11] stomach
[1:13:13] trouble and her face lit up she said
[1:13:16] that's
[1:13:18] true uh and the Holy Spirit said through
[1:13:21] me said and it's an aler it's caused
[1:13:24] from a nervous condition you've been
[1:13:26] examined by a certain doctor and he said
[1:13:29] that you could not have that I had to
[1:13:32] have an operation have it cut out she
[1:13:34] said every word of that is a truth then
[1:13:38] seen she's such a great believer and it
[1:13:41] said your name is Miss so and so you
[1:13:43] come from so and so in such and such a
[1:13:45] place he said that is the
[1:13:48] truth what was it the six sense catching
[1:13:52] it amen the six sense and the Holy
[1:13:55] Spirit was standing side by side the
[1:13:57] Holy Spirit was speaking the six sense
[1:13:59] was saying amen there it is something
[1:14:02] has to
[1:14:07] happen when Martha run out to find
[1:14:12] Jesus and when she said Lord what's the
[1:14:16] six sense if thou would have been here
[1:14:18] my brother would not have
[1:14:20] died but even now whatever you ask God
[1:14:24] God will give it to
[1:14:26] you there's the six
[1:14:28] sense Jesus pulled himself together and
[1:14:30] said I am the resurrection and life he
[1:14:34] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:14:37] yet shall he
[1:14:40] live whosoever liveth and believeth in
[1:14:42] me shall never die believest thou this
[1:14:46] what are you going to say reasoning
[1:14:47] there's a man laying on a dead and the
[1:14:49] worms is crawling through him but he's
[1:14:52] just got through saying he was the
[1:14:54] resurrection and the life that's God's
[1:14:58] word that's six sense beyond the
[1:15:01] doctor's care beyond the thoughts of
[1:15:04] scientific research def find all def
[1:15:07] find all reasonings and cast them
[1:15:11] down it's witnessing to God's word I am
[1:15:15] I know I will be I was I am
[1:15:18] now resurrection and
[1:15:21] life man he that believeth in me though
[1:15:25] he were dead yet he shall live and
[1:15:27] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:15:29] shall never die believest thou this he
[1:15:31] said y Lord six
[1:15:34] sense I believe that you are the Son of
[1:15:38] God that should come into the
[1:15:41] world Hallelujah thy brother shall rise
[1:15:45] again
[1:15:47] oh to the Grave they
[1:15:51] went them two together there something
[1:15:53] had to happen that was a super sense
[1:15:57] with God standing present something had
[1:15:59] to take
[1:16:01] place the sense was super sense was God
[1:16:05] there was something telling Martha that
[1:16:08] she'd seen him she knowed him she didn't
[1:16:11] recognized him to be the very Messiah
[1:16:14] and she know if she could only get to
[1:16:16] him if she could only get close to him
[1:16:19] and present the
[1:16:21] case just he One Promise come from him
[1:16:24] that's all she
[1:16:27] wanted when he said I am the
[1:16:29] resurrection of Life ye that believeth
[1:16:32] in me though he were dead that's all
[1:16:34] Martha wanted to
[1:16:35] hear all she wanted because the six
[1:16:39] sense the super sense her faith was
[1:16:41] moving her to
[1:16:42] confessing
[1:16:45] believing this woman when she left the
[1:16:48] platform it was thus sayeth the Lord go
[1:16:52] home and eat
[1:16:53] Jesus Christ makes you well
[1:16:56] oh she went
[1:16:58] home that night a friend of hers living
[1:17:02] in the neighborhood was third or fourth
[1:17:05] behind her and she had a big knot on her
[1:17:09] neck and here she come all thrilled
[1:17:13] about her her neighbor was going to be
[1:17:15] healed that ulcer that had bothered her
[1:17:17] so much this is one of the hundreds of
[1:17:20] cases thousands of them and this big
[1:17:23] knot sticking out on her neck and she
[1:17:26] come up I said no one would have to
[1:17:27] discern
[1:17:29] that but you're happy about something
[1:17:31] you've been thrilled because that woman
[1:17:33] sitting over Yonder is a neighbor of
[1:17:36] yours Holy Spirit she thought how in the
[1:17:39] world could that man know that it has to
[1:17:42] be something to reveal it to
[1:17:45] him so when that was said it said you're
[1:17:49] thinking about your neck yes do you
[1:17:52] believe it'll believe I believe it she
[1:17:54] said with all my heart I said thus
[1:17:58] sayith the
[1:18:00] Lord go home and you will receive your
[1:18:04] healing the natural man looked around
[1:18:07] and couldn't see no
[1:18:10] sign the woman with the AER went home
[1:18:13] and tried to eat in my she liked to
[1:18:16] died oh the natural man the natural
[1:18:19] sense of feeling still declared the
[1:18:22] offer
[1:18:24] there so after about a week or two had
[1:18:28] passed she went through the neighborhood
[1:18:31] to all of her people in the church
[1:18:33] testifying the Lord has healed
[1:18:36] me and they said are you eating
[1:18:39] now no not exactly everything I want but
[1:18:42] she said I'm already healed for by his
[1:18:46] stripes I am
[1:18:49] healed no matter what it was she was
[1:18:51] healed anyhow
[1:18:54] one morning the children had gone to
[1:18:57] school and she got real hungry she was
[1:19:00] standing washing the dishes by the
[1:19:02] window she came to the meeting another
[1:19:04] meeting about a year later and she was
[1:19:07] washing the
[1:19:08] dishes and when she uh first thing she
[1:19:12] felt a real funny feeling go
[1:19:15] over and she thought what was that felt
[1:19:19] like I wanted to
[1:19:21] scream and her husband had told her said

[1:35:24] at the healing of Margie margan I went
[1:35:26] down there and there wasn't nothing that
[1:35:28] woman could do should be dead within the
[1:35:30] next few hours they had a shot atud they
[1:35:33] could give her and that was all it had a
[1:35:35] female operation cancer R through her
[1:35:38] spine they scattered it when they
[1:35:40] operated it there was nothing to do for
[1:35:42] the woman I want to talk to her about
[1:35:44] healing but she said sir you are a
[1:35:47] minister of the Lord God and I'm not
[1:35:50] worthy that you would come into my
[1:35:53] house counting herself unworthy for a
[1:35:56] minister come she said I've lived the
[1:35:57] life I've danced and I've done things
[1:36:01] that I should not have done I've used
[1:36:03] bad language or whatever more she told
[1:36:05] me her sins and she said I'm not worthy
[1:36:08] of it I seen she was hitting the right
[1:36:10] line she'd have to get Christ in here
[1:36:12] before that sick super sense would ever
[1:36:14] go to
[1:36:15] work we knelt down I talked to her about
[1:36:19] though your sins be as Scarlet she gave
[1:36:21] her life to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:36:23] when she did she said oh oh I feel so
[1:36:28] different Something's Happened to me
[1:36:30] something's happened to me I want to
[1:36:32] shake hands with all of you just then I
[1:36:35] looked out and I seen her in a vision
[1:36:37] going back behind the house to a chicken
[1:36:38] coop I said Mrs Weaver thus sayith the
[1:36:42] Lord God you will make a trip to that
[1:36:44] chicken coop and you'll
[1:36:47] live she couldn't go over the way she
[1:36:50] felt can't caner eat her up she couldn't
[1:36:52] go what the doctor said she was dying
[1:36:56] and that's been I guess 14 15 years ago
[1:36:58] Miss Weaver 14 years ago she staggered
[1:37:03] up to this Tabernacle when she simply
[1:37:05] didn't look like she's able to get out
[1:37:06] of the
[1:37:07] bed little old bony arms because she
[1:37:11] promised God she'd come and be baptized
[1:37:13] in the name of Jesus we picked her up
[1:37:15] out of a wheelchair almost out a chair
[1:37:17] tuck her down in the pool and baptize
[1:37:19] her in the name of Jesus and there she
[1:37:21] she sits tonight look at her if you want
[1:37:24] to see a species of hell why Hallelujah
[1:37:27] casting down reasonings and scientific
[1:37:30] researches and everything else amen
[1:37:33] because the six sense went to
[1:37:35] word that's
[1:37:37] it look let me say this again just for a
[1:37:41] minute Jesus passed by a tree one
[1:37:45] time and it was a fig
[1:37:48] tree and he looked at the fig tree
[1:37:52] now please don't miss
[1:37:54] this he looked at the Fig
[1:37:57] Tree and there was no figs on it and he
[1:38:02] said he cursed the tree and said no man
[1:38:06] eat from Thee the disciples looked
[1:38:09] around tree looked like it always did an
[1:38:13] hour from that it still looked the
[1:38:16] same God never opened up the Earth and
[1:38:18] swallowed it
[1:38:19] up God never sent a Fark and lightning
[1:38:23] out of the skies and burn it to a
[1:38:24] charcoal he could have done
[1:38:26] it sure he
[1:38:30] could he never did those
[1:38:33] things what did happen the tree had been

[1:52:48] 1960s I believe it 611
[1:52:51] 1960
[1:52:53] of Faith the six
[1:52:56] sense and listen to these over and
[1:53:00] over think about it for I have received
[1:53:03] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:53:05] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:53:06] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:53:08] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:53:10] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:53:12] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:53:15] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:53:17] also he took the cup when he had subset
[1:53:20] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:53:22] my blood do do ye as often as you drink
[1:53:25] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:53:27] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:53:29] you do you the Lord's death till he come
[1:53:31] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:53:33] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:53:35] unworthily unworthily shall be guilty of
[1:53:38] the body and blood of the Lord but let a
[1:53:41] man examine himself and so let him eat
[1:53:42] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[1:53:44] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:53:46] eateth and drinketh Damnation to him him
[1:53:49] s not Discerning the Lord's body for
[1:53:53] this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:53:54] among you and many sleep for we would
[1:53:57] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:53:59] but when we are judged and I love that
[1:54:02] we're chasten to the Lord that we should
[1:54:03] not be condemned with the world
[1:54:05] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:54:07] together to eat t one for another and if
[1:54:09] any man hunger let him eat at home that
[1:54:12] you come not together un condemnation
[1:54:15] the rest will I set in order when I come
[1:54:18] let's just have a few moments of Silent
[1:54:21] prayer and just praying before the Lord
[1:54:22] and thanking him for the word that we've
[1:54:25] heard you know thank him for the ability
[1:54:28] to be able to talk about a six
[1:54:31] sense and not to just talk about it but
[1:54:33] have it living within us and knowing it
[1:54:37] is the new birth that we're talking
[1:54:39] about we're not talking about something
[1:54:41] that we've got to attain
[1:54:44] unto it's something that he has given
[1:54:47] us the new birth
[1:54:50] that's the six
[1:55:07] sense open our eyes Lord un Thy word
[1:55:10] that we may see ourselves therein and be
[1:55:14] able to walk into to that that we know
[1:55:17] is already living with in our
[1:55:21] hearts in our lives the baptism of the
[1:55:25] Holy Ghost the six
[1:55:27] sents even just with that Lord is the
[1:55:30] only way that we know for shity what
[1:55:33] this communion is about and to see what
[1:55:37] it took place what happened for you and
[1:55:40] I back there a long time ago but it's
[1:55:43] still real
[1:55:45] tonight we love you and we thank you in
[1:55:48] Jesus name
[1:55:54] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:55:56] it father we thank you for this bread
[1:55:59] and we pray it's been made for this
[1:56:02] purpose today and that is Lord that we
[1:56:05] may partake of this communion and we ask
[1:56:08] you to just sanctify the bread we know
[1:56:12] it's not your body but it's in symbol of
[1:56:15] it speaking of it an example how truly
[1:56:19] amazing it is to be able to see an
[1:56:21] example that would be a live meaning in
[1:56:24] our hearts and lives sanctify the bread
[1:56:26] and the partakers in Jesus
[1:56:36] name then it's a very solemn serious
[1:56:41] matter be able to take the
[1:56:44] communion to be able to know what it
[1:56:47] is and not be blinded like the the world
[1:56:50] that would go up and take a piece of
[1:56:53] bread and think that that forgive our
[1:56:57] sins or anything related to
[1:57:00] that but we do know the one thing that
[1:57:04] by the giving of your
[1:57:06] blood you know the Lord himself made a
[1:57:09] way for you and
[1:57:11] I be worthy to take the communion and to
[1:57:15] know what it is and to be able to walk
[1:57:17] in it
[1:57:20] and that way we don't have to worry
[1:57:21] about the the things of life we have it
[1:57:25] we have it in our
[1:57:28] understanding this is not the body this
[1:57:30] is not the the thing that the Lord lived
[1:57:34] within but this is an example unto each
[1:57:38] one of
[1:57:46] us father we thank you for this wine
[1:57:48] that's gone through the process now and
[1:57:51] Lord it gets better every day we praise
[1:57:54] you and honor you Lord for giving us and
[1:57:58] understanding this is not your blood but
[1:58:00] it's this example of it but it is
[1:58:03] something that once we eat that little
[1:58:06] piece of bread and we take this wine
[1:58:08] even in the natural it will be blood
[1:58:10] cells created in our body because of
[1:58:13] that we just ask you to sanctify the
[1:58:17] wine and their partakers that we may all
[1:58:18] be one together in you in Jesus name
[1:58:32] amen come
[1:58:35] morning I
[1:58:37] walk by the
[1:58:40] river I'll rest me the Ever Green
[1:58:48] Tree
