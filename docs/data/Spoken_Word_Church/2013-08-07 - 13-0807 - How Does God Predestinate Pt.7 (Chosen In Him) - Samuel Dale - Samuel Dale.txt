stuff don't worry about it if you want to go so remember that amen amen and we just pray for my wife and I today our 505th wedding anniversary and uh I told somebody today I or when was it yesterday or something any I said the only problem was that I wish I'd married her two years before and that would have made me 16 her 14 yeah but we made it up to where I was 18 she was 16 cuz if ID have married her I wouldn't have got out in the world into you know life and things as much and all so I I wish I had her but that's the way God has it ordained to be right and I believe it and I love her and I I really cherish her I appreciate her cuz she's been the the backbone of the family she's the one that keeps them all straight I just kind of run around with a little Whip and crack it every once in a while but the she keeps them all straight keeps it going but we appreciate her amen I wish everybody in the world had a wife like my wife I didn't say I wish everybody had a w my wife yeah man it work one time he tried his best to trade with me and it's because he's such a good cook and we took in some food you know and he said anytime you get ready to trade wise I'll just trade with you see because your wife is a good cook you know and she is amen amen all right Romans 8 and Ephesians 1 is any other announcements which in me we generally forget Something Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight tonight and your love and your grace and your kindness thank you for Calvary thank you for all the things Lord that you've given unto us and thank you Father tonight especially for salvation and then in the secondary form we thank you for a wife that's been with us for 55 years Lord and we thank you for the love that she's had for us and to stand beside of us and knowing I know that it's been a hard road because she just didn't understand me and I know that but yet she stood right there with me and always been there we thank you for that we ask you to be with us tonight in the service bless and guide each and every one of us the father we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28-31 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us what a great statement right now let's go to Ephesians 1 1 and we'll start with verse three down through verse 14 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded to toward us in all wisdom and Prudence now what I want you to do the reason I'm going from verse uh the thought will be taken from verse 4-6 but what I want you to think about is all of this here is what has happened to us here in this world right amen all right that's my whole point now is we you'll get back and you'll see what I'm talking about so then catch the point now in whom we have Redemption where at here through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according now surely we'd want to know that would be here but according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will Prophet said that is to adopt us according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that notice Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of the of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen and you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now uh I brought brother Joe ran these off a moment ago and uhu it's all of the the uh list and things of the video streaming and it was very odd because I've never noticed this place before to appear maybe it has but you know and I'm sure it has but in a place called poo Alto I guess you'd say it p a l o and a l t o California in July alone there was 575 hits the most of all p a l o a l t o pal California 576 what the odd part is we were only H 7 days into August there's already been 160 hits from them so uh somebody's listening am you know it must be a whole lot of them so uh we say welcome you know welcome I I don't remember seeing that before I'm sure it has been on there but you know but we say to you welcome uh just do the best you can putting up with me in my ways and trying to explain myself all right they three hours behind yeah and they're three hours behind us so that puts a a doing it amen they're going to be later all right but now what have we been talking about how does God predestinate Amen all right we've covered this then in uh trying to show and we had a the picture brother Joe has it on the the internet thing and if any of you need these we just made off a little drawing to where that you could kind of see the things that that we have put we split a part called as mind you notice a line going through and we got God Elohim self-existing now the service tonight if I can get it into the way that I want to it will be borderlining in between these two it'll be connecting to both places and that's what I said now from verse 7 on through in our readings we we know for a certainty that that's in life and journey and you know the things here in this world all right but we know also that for knowledge is the greatest thing of all because we used to think predestination was but then we begin to pay close attention to what the prophet was saying and he says about five or six times that you know predestination looks back to for knowledge he said then for knowledge will look forward to to Destiny am and then we covered our uh the P service that predestination would look back to election but election goes all the way and looks back to for knowledge so we covered you know make your call calling an election sure right in other words be sure that you know what you're talking about right that's what Paul was saying make your calling and election sure in other words know how they're doing what transpires all right see because we know that many are called but only a few are chosen but how come are they chosen now that's what we're going to get into tonight we read there in Ephesians that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world all right now how does God choose without being a respector of persons so we went over it and over it and over it with the quotes of looking at for knowledge and seeing that God predestined Ates by forn knowledge or fora forne whatever words you want to use in that we went into one time speaking of in in the mind of God but we've been trying to Define some things or divide them I have to where that we can uh better understand in reading the scriptures I said if we would read them I've always said you know if we just read the scriptures but read them with this common sense you know you said well you mean we're not common no we were blinded by doctrines and ideas of man and no matter what we read in the word it never corrected those doctrines and ideas we just bypassed that I remember brother Tatum saying one time he he was beginning to see the water baptism and he said he would read you know Matthew 28:9 wasn't so bad but when he get over acts 238 said he wanted to pass over that because there was something there that was bothering him well it bothered him until he got it straight then when he got it straight then he he he got it done am all right and see if you just read the scripture read it as they said we can look back in for knowledge and look back in uh predestin destination and things but the two things we're going to deal with and we'll try to get to it more at the end of the message is what we read that Paul says that we were chosen in him right before the foundation of the world Amen all right then it goes on to about verse six and it says that he's made us accepted but that's not dividing the point of just accepting you but it says he's accepting Us in the Beloved see if you left out that part you would just say what we just accepted us and then we can say well the choosing is just you know well he chose me because you know I I'm a I'm a predestinated seed all right all that's well and true but hard do we've been through with the prophet that he didn't even choose by right his own desires right amen he never predestinated by his own desires he really predestinated by our desires you know what we desire amen all right we've been through service after service trying to hold a point to where of looking at it of saying well hey look God being infinite had the ability to set back there in eternity before even atoms or molecules or anything came into being for Angels or or anything that he could sit back there as infinite God and with his infinite wisdom wisdom amen he could think about you know world and Mankind and and he knew that if he created us that we'd fall right amen he knew that why did he create us then to display his attributes of Savior healer Etc but he couldn't make us fall right amen he cannot override our free moral agency that's right amen true he can't do that see so then he goes by what we choose and he could look down and see us of what we would choose after we got here amen so I'd rather approach it that way you know all of these doctrines and they got their ideas and oh I was a predestinated seed and and if I happen to come from Adam I can be saved but if I come from the Beast I can't be and try to get all these natural gen seeds in there you know and and the scripture said it's not a and the promise wasn't even to Abraham and his natural seed right amen amen but it was through the promise right all right but yet you're not going to change anybody's mind about those thoughts right I don't try to do that I try to preach to you here and if anybody else is listening let it go down into their hearts and and see what's in their hearts and lives and let God deal with them cuz that's all we can do but yet we know that he didn't choose one and reject the other so in Jacob and Esau it couldn't have been that he you know chose Jacob and and rejected Esau as we think of the word choosing but yet he saw what they would do all right then he could go ahead and write it down he could even write the Bible about what you and I would do surely we believe we're in the age of Lady see people's rights right that's right and falling apart conquer the leoty right amen right well if we can see that why can't we see that there's also another side of that because that was the scriptures we use and showed that some were foreordained unto this condemnation right that's scripture because God knew the way they would go but yet the way that I've always said it and I love it he didn't stay up in heaven and just predetermine it stap it go over to the other end sit down and wait on us now he come down here to live with us don't you think that his uh Infinite Wisdom would let him know what was going to take place down in in uh Sodom and things but yet he said he come down to see if the things that were said were so amen amen he's a lovely God Amen so I'd rather believe in forn knowledge am and believe that God saw me as to accepting him as my savior I'd rather be that way than to try to approach it by some predetermined Factor right cuz amen the prophet said one time he said you know we talk about whosoever will see the people of the message they preach it to Big preachers they want to preach it that's not us that's foolish virgins and free moral agency only deals with foolish virgins and things but see I'd rather have whosoever will than to have my name written in the Bible that's what he said right he said because there's a lot of William Brams right but when you say whosoever will I can believe that's me amen that's right I want to stay in that line amen the point I'm trying to get you to see is I'm trying to drive it down you and I have a whole lot more to to do with this thing than we think amen cuz even like saying that we have nothing to do with our Salvation we're going to get through that tonight the Lord with it we don't have nothing to do with him dying right now you say Di for our sins that's fine but you know what I mean we don't do it we didn't do any part to kill him but we're here and why can't we believe that he died for us then why can't we believe that we do have something to do statue of a perfect man you're born again at Faith but then you got to grow up the pyramid right that's right not just lay back and wait the pyramid to fall on you but just think about it now because we're looking at Chosen and looking at accepted and both of them is in him right so the one that chose us accepted us amen right right then really truthfully it's not whether I'm chosen or not I'm not much concerned about that you said well I I am sure now I settled that a long time ago about you know being born again or not but you see if he was chosen then I can read that I was chosen in him but if I can't find that he was chosen yeah I I don't know what I've got right but see he you can say he chose me well then I can go back in into the for knowledge and and we can see how that's done right but the main thing is whether or not he was Joseph right y you what do you mean we know that well is it true that that's in our mind see then all I got to worry about is being in him amen right that's all I got to be concerned about if I know for a certainty he was chosen then I don't have to worry about whether I was chosen or not why because I was chosen in him right at the same time he was chosen well you sure sound like a trinitarian well I'll let you explain it yeah he was chosen all right and all I got to do is make sure that I make my calling in my election my choosing correct right like what does that scripture say uh where Jesus talking about I and you and you and me right well now it's easy to figure out you and me you know but how is he in us I in you and you in me right am you and me was settled before the foundation of the world right but I in you you is dealing with my life now that's right amen right and then we see that what that can go to the point of what that where Heath made us accepted in the Beloved I was reading one night the other day where the Prophet said that ought to make us run the A and rejoice to think about right yes Lord that we were chosen in him amen that we were accepted of him now if he accepted you I probably won't get on the notes anyway but if he accepted you there had to be some reason right sir are you listening amen sure there was some reason he accepted you right if not he just picking here and picking there and choosing one accepting one doing one there's got to be something about you the prophet said that God liked that's right you know I like that amen sir CU you see he accepted me remember what we were talking about David God said David I know your desires see an honest and the contrary heart was what God was looking at in David surely not his natural life and surely it wasn't in his genetic genes cuz if it was it short didn't mess up with basba to take a man's wife and have him killed to get his wife and then we think something could come through there to be holy right nothing need natural flesh is Holy at all amen amen but we make our calling and election sure other words find out how he done it we know he done it by four knowledge amen right that does not you know make him a respector of persons right he could stand back there before the world it just illustrating and look all the way through time and see the end of it if he can't he's not God that's right and I ask you a simple question to me I don't I don't have any problems is this what God saw or is this what God is seeing yeah I mean we do we want to get back here and look down there he's not back there and he's not over there right amen right he said I'll be with you always right amen he's here amen now come on folks a God over there ain't much help if I need him real quick he might be tied up on something and back there he might be if you don't like him terminologies you tell me something else to say and I'll say it to just show the point I'm kind of like the fell was that said he didn't want no secretaries you know when they asked or told him you know praying I don't I I want my calling an election sure I want to know there's just one true and living God and then he's not over there and he's not back there he's ever presentent which he's here right now see then that way I can think about how glorious it is to live in this life in the most horrible of conditions that we could ever exist in pain Agony or whatever heartaches troubles and still be happy amen see Church there is things coming rest we believe in that but why can't we be happy with what's here now amen that's right if we don't get this right here they ain't going to be no future right so why don't we live like it is here see I God off up in Yonder like I've always told you I know I'm dumb and ignorant and all that but God has helped me a little bit to try to explain something but see sometimes it' probably be a pretty good idea if there was three gods cuz that way I could pray to this and to pray to that and to pray to that one and maybe some way you know one of them to help me but I don't believe in that I believe there's one true and living God Amen and I'm not talking to a father that's a secretary or a son that's a something else I I want to talk to the head man amen amen Lord forgive me for terminologies like that but I can't say nothing else but think about it see my whole point of the message is we're chosen in him or were chosen in him if you want to put the when before the foundation of the world Amen and when he came here I was in him amen that's the part of me that's Eternal tonight am that's right not the Body Spirit soul of Samuel Dale with the soul of eternal life right and when he walked the shores of Galilee I walked the shores of Galilee that's right right am but when he died I died you know what he went to hell for me right amen but when he raised I raised amen I don't get back to that in a minute somebody remind me to get that quote about where he raised or not where brother R says it was and he uses some words that Webster don't have but you know cuz it had his own words just you know let me let me get that I sat there I lie sometimes with a third grade education that I mean the seventh grade education the man had and I got a ninth and I thought me and him could really talk am let me see if I can find it oh yeah go over to 9A brother brother Joe this is taken from law and Grace 1954 106 paragraph 1 68 while he's getting over to finding it there you go and look what he says am oh my how I love him is his grace nothing I could do nothing I could nothing you can do but we coming together as Christian men and women confesses that we're unworthy unworthy and accepting him in our stad accepting that one that I know just just as sure as God accepted him and raised him up he raised me in a figary there's no word form the same time he raised Christ amen I got to stop but look in a figure ter form and go on look at them the dictionary I hope you find some dictionary that's got it in it where we can get a definition but he said it was in a figary form or a figary form he raised me the same time he raised Christ he raised you the same time he raised Christ but that was for our justification amen the best definition I can come up in any way was the word figurative which means reesing representing by means of a figure or likeness no when he raised me when he raised up I didn't physically raise right come on he physically raised amen well my my body hadn't even been brought into existence as a body was l in the Earth but see then it goes on to say that that's the way we was accepted in the Beloved so it's a it it it means the best that I can Define it is a a basis of not physically but I was represented in him are you with me that's the best I can go with it I was represented in him in a form now what would that form be my body didn't raise when he raised so it means there's something within him and that's what's accepted that's right you and I as people are persons have to had to come in this life and accept him and then he could accept us remember not you accepted him that's right it's whether or not he accepted you all right so now if we were chosen in him and if we raised when he raised and we didn't raise physically you know tangible flesh but we raised in a form in him according to my Bible it says that if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead be in you it will change the form right it will Quicken your mortal body so there is a change in form amen so then before the world ever was the Bible says and I showed you on the thing that we used it that he stood as a lamb slain but that's over in here dealing with coming forth from his mind toward reality toward reality in doing see from here that way deals with all the things that will transpire and I don't mean all of these are all of them but the things that will transpire upon Earth the adoptions the becoming the word the baptism of the Holy Ghost justification sanctification calling an election choosing for knowledge even Cedar word cuz he knows where that cedar word will fall right amen so then think about it if we don't believe in predetermining then we believe that or much believe that in the mind of God not in an actual physical transpiring but in the mind of God he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world right now if he had never come to that in this world that would have make that false prophecy but we know he did amen so then God could look down through and seeing it from back there he could predetermine it but he could look down through and see you wanting a savior amen all right that's right what is a predestinated seed or what is a nonseed the prophet say a nonseed there's nothing to Quicken nonseed is a seed that doesn't have a seed or a hybrid is another word for it but you see God looked down through and he saw that you would want to be saved that's his for knowledge you know what before the world he could predestinate that there no problem with me right see he could predetermine that you'd accept would come to him but you know what I like about it I still don't believe he stayed up there on vacation right amen how many of you can remember in your life maybe a accident or something or in your accident oh great tragedy that took place that you realize that there has to be a god somewhere MH right amen and that he was concerned enough to take care of me at that time when I wasn't serving him that's right before I started serving him I mean how many of you can think about in your life and just remember things that transpired that could have very easily taken your life but yet something happened amen right even until we told like with Josh where the people that was in the car behind him when he had that wreck they wanted to know where the other person was at it was in that car three people saw somebody get out of the car and walk away my point even though he knows what it'll be that's right he still loves to come down and fellowship with us and let us know how great he is amen that he could just know in it in the quote we had up there brother around says and just as the same time that he accepted Christ he accepted me in Christ amen on down close to the bottom at the same time he accepted him he accepted you when are we going to start realizing church that we have received a message to correct all of the ideas and thoughts that we once had and our worries and our burdens and things that we carried because we didn't know the answer and yet we can just read a simple prophet's message and God can speak to us and give an answer am chosen how does he choose by his forign knowledge or else you're making him pick one I've got one in here where he said well it's the first one go ahead not number nine Joe excuse me back up one where you were at number nine which is adoption uh part two 19658 he said I want to stop on that word of predestinated predestinated Now predestinated isn't say that's not what it is now I'll choose brother Neville and I won't choose brother beer that isn't it it's the for knowledge of God that knowed which one would be right and which one wasn't right so by for knowledge God knowing what he was going to do he predestinated by his full knowledge to make it all things work together for the good of them that love God what are we dealing with as I said the other day then in the message you know you hear the preachers of the message and the Le too oh if I just believe I was in the mind of God and if I in the mind of God then we just remember Judas is carot was in the mind of God right when he thought of Jesus Christ coming on Earth it was necessary that he think of Judas being there to betray him not to make him betray he would say oh he didn't have no choice he was a son of predition I believe he had a choice am I believe everybody has a choice because if he doesn't have a choice what what's God going going to do with it are you listening you know we see we want to lay on that we were chosen back there well that's wonderful but remember it was in him now the story is not that God was up there going one 2 3 4 leave that now 6 8 10 12 all them chosen now Jesus you go down and be the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world now what kind of a God would that be but yet in his infinite mind and wisdom that he would even know as the prophet said that if he created us that we'd fall and said he had to put us on free moral agency amen and he had to put every man on free moral agency he said and then he would know our choice or our our choosing of which way to we wanted to go and there's any problem then he could write the Book of Life know is that a a point that we he would write one 's name into Lamb's Book of Life and leave another out would that be choosing no it would be because that he look down and seen and then see when he was accepted back there I was accepted in him amen that's the way I was chosen was in him by what by him being accepted he was chosen to do a job as poor we saying he was chosen to be come into the world and die and be our savior now we'll get back to that that's what I said this message tonight is running a borderline close on that part where you see mind in there that there a line in between right in the middle because we're going back on over closer to the predestinated seed and see what that is and how it falls and what it takes place but if we don't get this for knowledge correct that's right we won't be any difference than anybody else right but if we get four knowledge to the bases that God fornew then he could write a Bible before the world right amen but he didn't just write down Revelations on it 138 who whose names were not written in the L book of L for the foundation world is that the only scripture was written no the whole Bible was written that's how he could know Jacob how I love and Esau how I hate why because the whole Bible about what Jacob and Esau would do was written back there right we're just f fulfilling what was written we're just making manifest what was written before the world us sitting here tonight you sitting there listening to me is just a manifestation or of what you call it a materializing of what God saw before the world why can't we believe that well well it just don't make me feel good brother T that's what I said you ain't hit forn knowledge right yet if you don't feel good about forn knowledge to know that God looked down and saw amen that you would choose Amen to accept him as your savior if that don't put a thrill into your heart amen maybe you don't have one why would it say to the prophet because you've chosen this way a great portion of Heaven awaits you am now what if he hadn't chose it like I was saying the other day when he's riding down the road saying I'll just quit go back up the mountain be a prophet stom out give him a message go back God showed him a trist D burning y yep he said that's where you'll be he made a choice look like it'd be all right for him to go back and be a prophet and just come stomping out it would have been okay in the Old Testament cuz that's the way they done but a new testament Prophet can't do that a new testament prophet's got to live with the people right but you see what I'm talking about he had chosen Us in Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world Amen all right why because he was chosen that's right am that's right he was accepted and I was accepted if I have eternal life see now it's back in my lap why would it say choose you this day whom you will serve if you didn't have a choice he wouldn't say that he said go on and be happy and forget it if you happen to be you happen to be see he chose us in him right because he saw we would choose him down here why have we forgotten that part of predestination amen oh what everybody wants I've got the quotes if you want them L on my desk especially you never sought God God sought you right it makes me feel good there's that for knowledge I'm talking about am you said what is he talking about brother he said you never sought God no man sought God at any time that's exactly right when you was a sinner was you seeking God no no way but he was seeking you right amen right amen see we want to put it all well I don't have nothing to do with it now whatsoever because he sought me he picked me he chose me he accepted me and I'm on my way to heaven I wish it was that way right then if that would be true then the Rapture change would be some automatic process of time running out I drop little points every once in a while about what I'm thinking about and you might order to write them down other words when I come right in the middle of a predestination for knowledge thought and then start talking about the Rapture if I was you I'd pay close attention for a little bit and write it down I'm just telling you you see the Lord showed me what the Rapture was just a little glimpse of it that's what I'm preaching how about you own four knowledge if we don't get this right don't worry about it if we don't get our call in an election sure if we if we can't find out how we were chosen and how we was accepted you know that he was accepted to the father and when he was accepted I was accepted in him amen right I have our brother back here with us and see it chosen in him not by him choosing for his own desires or thoughts but because he knew knew what you'd want here's where we get so messed up in it though cuz I know the human thinking cuz that's the way I think okay we think uh Brother D I just don't understand when brother BR said that I never sought God because I prayed and cried and fasted and well that's good you know what that's what God was looking at MH right but it didn't make him save you no he'd already done it it didn't make him choose you he already chose you he chose you before the foundation of the world am cuz he knew you'd cry out and desire for God and brother BR said no man sought God God he's not doing away with praying and crying out and seeking the Lord well don't just he'll run me down if you ever wants me if he don't want me I just lost anyway you know well that's good is it that ain't even good Baptist yeah they did at least try to predetermine it to be something right but church are you following me an infinite God could look down through time and see every gnat that would ever come into the world and how many times that gnat would bat its eye and you mean to tell me that us peanut brain human beings is going to pull something over on him but you see we want to we take one thing we take it a wsid it well I didn't seek God God sought me that's good cuz when you as a sinner you never sought God I didn't either but one day he caught up with me amen thank you Lord and when he caught up with me there was just just enough of let me say if I can quot it right brother R said any person has ever come into the presence of an eternal being he said he'll never be right the rest of his life that's the best way to say it I guess they'd never be right the rest of his life let God cross a man's path and he'll never be no different I mean never be something that work he he just can't be the same no more right that's why I said you go into the four corners of the Africa and find a person that never heard of the name Jesus or talked about that way of God and he's worshiping an idol right and yet he's sometimes better off than we are but he accepted us and he had a reason let me get that point he had a reason why would he allow you and I to hear the end time message that's right why would he give us the new birth that's right why would it be that you and I could see things that the world can't see that's right I like the scriptures myself even like where it says blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness the prophet said one day like this he said it's a blessing to hunger and thirst y amen you you know what a lot of people don't have it right but to have a desire in your heart to serve God is a wonderful opportunity amen but see we try to figure it all out is to try to find some form of something that makes us something that's always been man in his ways that's what causes denominations and and organizations and doctrines and ideas is people wanting to be greater than somebody else I got that first I first want to preached on that well he accepted us are we willing to lay down all of our thoughts and ideas and see that the great Eternal God had some reason for you and I am well I'm just a housewife I'm just a this I just you got your parten you got your part don't you just be your part amen why try to figure out to be something else yeah but I need to help God we don't need to help God right amen he called you to do something just go do it but if you don't never call you and tell you to do not just sit down and be so happy where was the Revival started back there in the ages one time you know by a lady on Wells Revival by Lady cleaning the pews and saying Lord bless that's this person that sits right here I started a a Revival that was one of the greatest of one person and don't you think that God before the world knew that right but you know what he was waiting on he was waiting on that lady he wasn't up in heaven he's waiting on that lady he's waiting on Martin Luther to run out of all of his thoughts and ideas and then he could cross his path and say that the just shall live by faith amen start a Reformation to the whole world well brother Dale do you believe Martin Lu was a predestinated seed I believe ever born again Christian is a predestinated seed that's the way I believe it I believe everybody that has eternal life is a predestinated seed amen that's the way I believe it no but there's some predestinated is something what are you trying to work it out with yeah you why I just be happy say thank you Lord let me just do what you want me to do Lord I'll get my job done accepted in the Beloved elected by for knowledge we think boy election's got to do with something you know elected by his for knowledge that way it's not God choosing one and rejecting the other right it's us choosing what we will do that's right but yet God already knew that if he if he's God if not let's forget it he knew before the world what we would choose that's right he never brought this message down in the ages V right they couldn't handle it you think a man like Martin Luther great man come out there a great wonderful man yet he was still a trinitarian he said all the Jews were to be T and killed but you know God didn't fuss with him about that right he never jerked him up and send him to hell because of some thought he had right cuz he knew down in that man's heart was ringing out a thought that just shall live by faith Amen Let Me end it up by just saying this could your desires or your thoughts tonight be what God is working on right see I think one of these days somebody's going to catch it we're going to walk off this Earth You know I believe that amen un likee brother MO I always like the way he Illustrated it he said when you're climbing up a ladder said just take one rung at a time right he said don't back up and run towards the ladder and try to jump up on it he said just take one step at a time I said that's right Lord let me just step out as he reveals it right amen but I believe that somebody is going to come to a place until they're going to see not the past and not the future that's right but they going to see what's going on now that's right why would we worry about the future we're not there yet it'll take care of itself we're not there but if we're not here in present tense and get this right what does it matter if we step into another day do you realize how simple I'm trying to say the whole world was in Mass confusion and one man said the just shall live by faith that's right turn the whole world upside down amen one man has already brought us the message in the end time but that man was not capable of fulfilling all the things and he never preached it as he was capable or was called to do it right right he gave us the scriptures and gave us the thoughts the five full Ministries for the perfecting of the Saints that's according to the Bible and according to the prophet and we want to say the prophet is f where's the scripture where's the quote I want it right if you bring it to me I'll say I won't never preach again that's right no problem with me Butz I know you can't find it they said that ain't going to change nobody that believes it that way but all it's going to do is give hopes to those that are maybe not knowing exactly where they're at and saying Lord show me what's going on show me what's going on Lord and my part of it what I can do church I I've always just been one that tried to do one thing I've always tried to is just to take the Bible and believe it I believe there was had to be a man I'll get back to this one of these days they had to be a man man come into the world because the Bible said there'd be a voice of one crying in the wilderness that man came and from his youth he was trained and one day God told him he said go on out I got your job ready for you now you're going to introduce the Messiah John the Baptist stood out there and the whole World against him and said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world y that's right he didn't care who was against him that's right was it was a simple message I believe the Rapture is the same way somebody is going to walk right into it and it's not a positive thinking point right but yet we've got to be positive we're not positive we're negative anyway so but it's not a positive of somebody just said okay now what we going to do here everybody in the church now what I want everybody to do now I want you to 14 times a day to say or 10 million times be better to say I'm already redeemed that probably make us all happier and we wouldn't be so down and out at the mouth you know so sad but that wouldn't do what I'm talking about God chose somebody to bring the message in the end time that's right amen I believe that message amen sir now he's chose you and I Amen to make that message alive why would a prophet himself say the bride of Christ is to vindicate you on the Internet run it NC he said the bride of Christ would vindicate melachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 that's right he said well God's already Vindicated that well why did he say the bride would vindicate it that's right amen see we got a job to do get all of our ducks in a row as we call it and start walking in the line maybe we can find it I believe it'll be a very simple message right right but it won't be with just one preacher preaching it that's right I've never believed that we had one Prophet we don't need anymore no but we need a five-fold Ministry that's right around the world then we need a bride a group of people to make aive what that Ministry is saying that's right that's right I believe in it see that way we all then got aart come on brother that's right amen we got aart had a lot of quotes about Chosen and what it was if you can't believe that we were chosen in him before the foundation of world all the scriptures has been read and what I've said and what the prophet has said and what all has been said then you're not going to believe it anyway but just remember what I started off with it's not whether or not I'm chosen that I'm trying to to figure out if I can take the word and prove he was chosen right and all I got to do is make sure I'm in him amen it's not whether or not I'm accepted it's whether or not he was accepted if I can believe he was accepted and I know I was accepted in him very simple maybe sometimes it's too simple because people lik this great things that makes it look so beautiful and you know great swelling words but all I'm trying to do is get you to see Jesus Christ and he died to take my place all he wants is me to die to let him live that's the whole story the Christian Life right so it's not whether or not you're and I worth anything my whole dependen is in whether he was worthy go ahead brother let's Stand Together sing number 612 in the spal book as a dear p de the you alone what about it church do you believe he was chosen I don't have any trouble you I don't have any problem beleving he was chosen but I know he was worthy you are and all I got to do is make sure that same life that was in him is in me you are my and you are my brother even though you are my king whatever let's just believe let's believe and say thank you Lord all be taken care of Father we lay our hands upon our brother believe in one thing the same God you saw before the foundation of the world as you being God and seeing all things saw that Jesus Christ would stand as a lamb slain but not only that he'd be the healer the Redeemer and we believe you Lord we lay our hands here and believing all the group together we believing that by your stripes this problem that Terrence is having is gone because we believe you father and we just accept it because we realize you accepted us you're
