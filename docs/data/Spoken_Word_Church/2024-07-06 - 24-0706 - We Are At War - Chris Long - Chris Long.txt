great for the kids and I enjoyed being there I attended the kids Tabernacle cuz they have two for the under 13 and for the older ones and actually they have for the Youth too and brother Trevor did the youth and the other brothers did the big one and I took the kids to the kids Tabernacle and it was interesting there because they like demonstration you know preaching with demonstration and it was wonderful uh the one that stood out for me was brother John Sanger I may say their name wrong he's from Pennsylvania so he had planned all these Salmons for the kids and he took the morning morning service I believe morning services and so he taught them Bible scripture Sarah can remember all of them and one of the services he brought a plow you know we're supposed you know if Sarah could say the Bible verse I forgot you know no one is the one who looks back when plowing is not fit for the Kingdom so he brought that and so what okay that that was one the one that stood out for me was he taught them the devil being a scammer how the Devil is a scam cu the brother actually was scammed his identity was stolen for the singer yeah he's a pastor and so through all that he came up with that sermon and he had uh a real a real person that was part of the sermon and a fake um scarecrow so he had real fake real fake different things and when it came to the fake owl you know the devil being the fake owl he didn't have a real bird and he didn't know how to catch a bird how do you catch a bird and bring it so so keep that aside now there's this couple from Guyana who've been coming to that camp since they started I believe 40 something years just coming to clean the bathrooms clean you know whatever cleaning pick up trash just a black couple from Guyana they're old now and this year they called brother um the one who organizes brother the Doug and told Brother Doug brother Doug it looks like we won't be able to come this year uh why would you come uh the lady who keeps her parrot is not able to keep the parrot this year so well brother brother dck says um so they're in New York so brother uh brother Dak asks them is the parrot a Christian cuz the camp is for Christians uh he says well sister the wife wife preaches to Ruth her name is Ruth the the the parent she preaches to it I guess it's a Christian so brother Doug says well we've never had a bird just bring it in a cage what do we do we need you so they come and the guy who was driving them had to call the state to confirm that they can drive a bird through state lines which is a big thing but they finally made it so now time to preach for brother Doug then he he has as a parrot you know he has as a parrot and he didn't have that so I like wow look how God organized things and uh that really stood out for me I thought I better share amen glory my my my the Lord cares about all the details praise the Lord Jesus amen what a wonderful testimony amen amen that just gives me a little Joy let's

on the other side perhaps God will let him look down today am and uh see the fruits of his efforts amen here at the Tabernacle amen and I want you to know something that now he is pulling for us he was pushing on you while he was here but now he's pulling for us because they without us cannot be made perfect and so we're we're we're we're in a battle we're in a fight brother and uh brother Mike said that uh he was uh I love brother Mike oh I tell you what love brother Mike is's a is's a a man of to me a man of wisdom abely and the way God deals with him through the word and his thoughts are wonderful to me uh they really do help me I get lots of uh notes uh maybe they're not directly from there but uh just just wonderful and he said that he was uh kind of scattering it out and of course I immediately I thought of the Waffle House I didn't say anything but immediately I thought of the waffle he said salad and I said no scattered smothered covered whatever that phrase is he had it all going on Amen I really enjoyed it so then he mentioned and brother Wade said something about meat well I told my wife earlier today I said I'm going to tell the folks that I'm going to be bringing them dessert we're but we're not bypassing the main course I'll tell you why have you ever had minced meat pie well I grew up on it yeah I know it sounds terrible but the minc meat pie that my grandmother grew up on was minced meat right all right we're not going to mince any words with you that's right I can tell you that right now but the mince meat pie that I grew up on was made out of different things like pecans and raisins to imitate yeah mince meat and you know if you know me at all you know that I like anything sweet amen that's why I love my wife thought I'd get that in there everybody comfortable all right I'm going to take you up to the Natural Food okay now I give the title of the message I've been preaching at home and I feel like I'm at home you're just an extension of the family of God around the world and and uh I I've been preaching on war amen we are at War amen you may not want to be at War and you may not realize that we're at War but we we are at War whether we like it or not and let me tell you something about the bride of Christ she likes it amen she likes it because she knows that God ordained her to do a job and that job requires a battle amen so this may seem like a strange scripture to read but I want you to turn to psalms 27 yeah okay does doesn't that seem like a strange scripture to and you all know me I'm I'm learn the I'm learning gadgets but I'm not that good at him okay but I'll get the hang of it you just give me a minute I'll get the hang of it I'm going to do my best to stay in line with the thoughts that God has given me psalms 27 all right better find it myself got it right here how many knows where this scripture is found in the message the Rapture seems like an odd scripture uh for me when I first listened to the message Rapture many years ago I said I wonder why he's reading that scripture why ain't he reading Thessalonians or why why ain't he reading uh 1 Corinthians 15 why wh wh what what what what is the why not Revelations 4:1 psalms 27 whether he knew it or not God knew something you ready amen the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear amen all right the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fail all right we're at War you know amen though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War yes see should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock let's pray father now father many years later it's been revealed to me father and to your children why this portion of scripture father makes perfect sense makes perfect sense to me Father for the oncoming Rapture that we are anticipating Lord because we're finding out in these scriptures that there is a hiding place but it does not produce fear it produces confidence and we know that the enemy is not going to relent he's not going to relinquish he's he's not going to back up Lord we even know so much about the enemy that he thought he had you when you showed up down there in hell but you showed up there for a different reason father he didn't have you yeah you wanted them keys back yeah and you got them now Lord I pray tonight that you'd give us at least one of those keys which is Faith Amen to believe every word Lord amen we know father that without believing every word we'll never have the token n we'll never be able to enter into this Pavilion father because the token is required amen help us each and every one father I pray bless your children in their efforts here father for standing firm those that are on the stream or the hookup Lord bless them Father help them I pray because our desire father is not to be seen or heard but it's to present your word father in such a way where it'll turn on the light cuz there is a man who can turn on the light father we're thankful for him amen we're thankful for you let it be for your honor and your glory father we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you may be seated I'm so sorry for keeping you up but see I I I didn't even realize when I was first uh uh uh penciling this down and getting these thoughts and I've been preaching at home on the token and I've taken it uh to the place where brother Mike presented it to last night as as well as I've ever heard it presented and that is it's one thing to see the the signs wonders and miracles it's one thing to know the acts of God but it's another thing to have a personal relationship with God and today the token is the life of God and we realized that the blood that was applied back there uh in the days of of The Exodus was a sign yeah the token did have a meaning right um it it it but it was a representative meaning amen you understand that that blood that was applied to the doorpost and lentil uh of every home that that had a revelation to apply it um it it was a sign that a life had been given that's really what it meant that blood there was was a sign that a life had been given up and what that blood represented was the life in so much that it was the carrier of that life see now I got to thinking about carrier and I could preach on aircraft carriers but brothers and sisters do you realize that the day you and I live in as brother Mike said last night so eloquently is a dispensational change something is happening in order for us to make the Rapture there's going to have to be a change in the way we think the change in the way we The Way We Walk and the way we act and so forth and and and I and I and I realized something right away that the devil is is is is on is on the ropes we're in a fight we're in a war he's on the ropes but he is not going to give up all right I remember uh when I was a boy and by the way you don't know this but my middle name is clay and he's the Potter yes that's right amen but I wasn't named after a pot I was named after Cashes Clay it's my father father was a boxer okay and that was some of the Young Folks don't know who that is Mohammad Ali he he changed his name oh so there is a name change a name that's right huh people do it all the time down here on Earth right but a lot of people don't want to accept the fact that we're going to have to change something's got to happen amen now the reason why the devil's on the ropes is because he thinks that we're dopes yeah right that was the tactic of Muhammad Ali he was the fastest most powerful quickest boxer of his day yes but he was also the most intelligent amen and he beat most of his opponents before he ever got in the ring with them through psychology but we don't serve a god of psychology we serve a god of his word amen and we need to learn how to take God at his word in such a way where we are indefensible that's right amen I think that the prophet of God called us an invincible Army is that right and I believe that's what we represent today we are in a battle some of you right now are battling with would you tell that guy to get off of that platform I've heard enough yeah well come on on I mean it's we're all different yeah righten I'm not imputing you or demeaning me what I'm saying is human nature yes is always looking for the easy way out but that's not the God we serve amen there is a way out amen and that way out is through God's word amen and God's word is declared as we're going to find out that whether we like it or not we're in a war amen all right amen and the reason that the devil is so adamant about keeping us uh away from our responsibilities and duties is because he's had it once you and I come to the Revelation that we are what God is going to use to defeat the enemy at the last battle amen which by the way is the greatest battle ever fought that's right amen amen now the war the word War can I give it to you oh yeah a war is the entire conflict so from the beginning to the end where did this war start Revelations 12 tells us that Michael and his angels fought and Lucifer and his angels and Lucifer and his angels couldn't Prevail over Michael and his angels in heaven amen so God gave them a way of Escape y cast them down here to Earth and the war has been going on here ever since all right we all know that am okay so War the word War represents the entire conflict so think about this the younger people maybe World War I yeah there was many battles there was all kinds of Nations and ideas and Generals and soldiers and weaponry and so forth but the Bible tells you and me that there ain't a weapon formed no amen not one weapon formed amen that can Prevail against us right but God has given us the most powerful weapon there is and that's his word now brother brandom in one place I've got it here causing an atomic bomb that's how powerful the sharp two-edged sword of Hebrews 4:12 is it's got Atomic power in it and what Atomic power represents to you and me is the ability to change molecular structure huh like brother juel I love I love brother juel I wouldn't know you if it wasn't for brother juel right he's he he's he's as good a man to me as he's ever been I told him at The Breakfast Table a couple of day look brother juwel if if I if the Lord doesn't permit for you to get back to your former self you have already won the battle already now I'm not I'm not taking it away from the Lord he can be restored see you and I this battle that we're in is a battle such as this well he's he's old he's done his work he's he's had these health problems and I'm using everybody as an example now we got brother Barry edin down here in in Augusta Georgia and and he's 84 and and he's lived a long life and and and and and a lot of times I'm I'm I'm uh confessions good for the soul I'm telling you that that that that I would look at that picture say well he's lived a good life he served the Lord he's suffering so so it's it's time perhaps for him to go to be with the Lord right okay so so but there there's nothing wrong with that but it it's sort of the easy way out right why can't we believe when people are in those situations or conditions that God is more than willing and able to be able to bring them back to whatever condition he wants them to be in and be satisfied with that but we also serve a God in the Book of Judges chapter 7 who said Gideon I want you to go fight a battle for me and and here's a deal there's going to be so many of you and and and and and Israel's had so much success that that the people are going to begin to think it's them and not me talking about the Lord now so he told Gideon if you read it we just just just let me just go over it for a second he said I want you to go to battle and the Bible tells us there were 32,000 people ready to go to battle it uses the word people yeah so that could be men women and children you know over in Israel you got to go you've got to go in the military that's right whether you like it or not because they need to defend themselves at all and every cost right now they're just a type we understand it's a natural type how many understands that brother Brenham said all scripture listen careful all scripture and all prophecy is compound yes those are the words of the prophet and I believe them amen compound yes that means one thing and of course brother Brandon would give us the example of I've called my son out of Egypt right you understand he used Moses and then he used Christ well we're in a Third Exodus amen sure we are amen all right don't don't discount the last one now okay and I I'm going to raise my hand and I'm going to tell you that I have fulfilled now the word compound means two or more you and I have fulfilled at least the compound of that scripture by being called out of Egypt amen Egypt to you and I is the world we were born in the condition we were born in we have been called out amen right right amen I believe you believe that yes amen but let me get into the meat amen of the fight the devil knows he only has so much time that's right so so he he had special Elite fighting forces that he's been training since the beginning of his time right and they are called the 200,000 th000 Horsemen from the river Euphrates they was let out in the natural Sense on Israel right but in the spiritual sense they was leted out on the bride now you'd say the church but what them 200,000,000 Horsemen are able to do is separate out the church from the bride right away because the church turns tail and runs amen but the bride of Christ stand she don't understand but she'll stand no matter what the cost amen now the God we serve wants to make sure that there is just the exact amount of people right amen left behind that are going to have the intestinal fortitude to take him at his word and realize that we're on the threshold of the Rapture but we're at War yes now I see why brother brandham read that scripture cuz God does have a safe house for us there's a safe place tomorrow I'm going to preach on God's infirmary yeah amen oh he's got one don't you remember the prophet of God saying wouldn't you have liked to look in Moses's bag to see what Moses had in there oh yeah you didn't know this but Abraham carried one too right right yeah his bag was full of Faith yeah amen and that's all you need yeah but it's got to be the Revelation the faith of Jesus Christ it can't be any other faith if you mix your own intelligence if you mix your own reason if you mix your own conscience if you mix anything of yourself in there it's polluted and it will fail yeah amen say well where are you going with this brother Chris we are in a battle yes now I'll keep reading but let me just preach amen the situation with you and I as we look at things like the greatest battle ever fought so remember now a battle is a conflict inside the war amen the war is the beginning and the end of this thing there are many conflicts and skirmishes inside the beginning and the end amen all right and we are in the greatest battle ever fought amen but here's the difference between the way we think and the way God thinks you and I since we have come to know the Lord or have we heeded his call you with me because we found out out that no man seeketh God love the way brother Mike put it God seeketh man but see we think God's out there in the universe seeking this no he's inside of the seed that he put in you and I before the foundation of the world and the deep is in their calling and when the Deep responds it says here am I Lord who said that who was that I've often said this in Matthew 16 when Peter made the Declaration Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God in Me it would have been inside of me if I was Peter it would have been who said that yeah cuz remember Peter denied him a little while later so you see there was more to Peter than meets the eye there was another Peter there was another Peter in there but it was not it he hadn't been converted yet so as brother Mike would say last night there was a still Small Voice down inside that seat saying let me out of here I want out this ain't the real me that's right huh amen the real me is a Believer what's going on oh we're in a battle we're in a fight and the way you and I look at things because we're in the flesh we're creatures of time yes right right you know we have we have uh uh H perimeters and boundaries and and things that that that that that we bump into and that that hold us up and we stumble over and we have to climb over and we have to go under and we're in a battle amen and we think it's the greatest battle ever fought but let me tell you folks something for the bride of Christ she is Victorious over her old nature she becom the Overcomer of Revelations 3:21 amen she's now in condition to fight amen oh bro I've been fighting all along but you're fighting yourself that's right and you're Your Own Worst Enemy you're see as long as the devil has got you and me occupied with battling within ourselves we can't be a soldier in the Army that's going to take it to the devil at the end we're busy fighting ourselves we're busy fighting with one another but the Bible declares this is not a battle against flesh and blood as a matter of fact the Bible confirms that Paul telling us that flesh and blood cannot inherit so here we are preoccupied spending what little time we have here on Earth fighting something that is not going to inherit right amen amen right bud we're in a different kind of a battle once be once H how do we become Victorious over the enemy that we call ourselves it's real simple love brother Mike again God and simplicity it's so simple that we're too busy and we Overlook it you know we we we we want we want to Google it yeah yeah we we want to go on the internet we want to find out what what a so so it's people why did you stay off the internet do you think it's doing you a bit of good oh brother I get a good deal on stuff that's not what you use it for yeah busy looking and occupying and presuming and assuming and okay and I'm not preaching against you don't don't oh brother Chris we can't you I didn't say that no I said you're in a battle Yeah amen you're in a war amen right so you got to be careful about the weapons that have been formed yes that's right huh no weapon has been formed that's right but you know as well as I do your mother said don't you run with those scissors yeah huh you could fall and stumble you could stumble oh we're getting into the now you could stumble that's right and accidentally impale yourself you with me a lot of people think Saul committed suicide he did not commit suicide huh brothers and sisters we're in the greatest battle ever fought amen but the greatest battle ever fought is taking it to the devil yeah amen it's so simple you want to overcome all you've got to do is believe yes the word of God which says I paid the price Jesus Christ said I paid the price for you my blood is sufficient my grace is sufficient that's what gave Paul strength abely think about it Paul struggled you know with with the battle inside of him what was it well he persecuted as we heard again that's why there was brother Mike was led of the Holy Spirit as far as I'm concerned cuz I had my notes already and I said that's it that's it that's confirmation Lord I don't need anymore just stick with the notes amen right stick with the thoughts that God give you yeah right CU we're in a fight am but it's not against flesh and blood and and and what do we find ourselves fighting so often flesh and blood it's not even going to inherit no that's what the scripture says yes praise the Lord war is the conflict the entire Conflict by NE by definition war listen now is a state of hostility conflict or antagonism yeah right do you want me to break that down for you you got any hostility how about conflict oh well watch the third one antagonism I just read this out of the dictionary yeah War see this the this is the entire [Music] conflict war from the beginning to the end we're going to find out in our Bibles before this is over that the bride of Christ is Victorious I just don't want to go there yet also it is a struggle or watch now oh man when I was reading this brother Aon I said this is it war is also a struggle or competition yeah I didn't make this up the dictionary said all right all right between opposing forces or for a particular end so let me read it to you the way that I put it down out of the dictionary war is a struggle for a particular end war is also competition between opposing forces for a particular End Amen yeah okay we're not going to end no am brother brother Samuel is just on the other side he's not it's not over amen the prophet of God told us all of our loved ones that have gone on before us is just taking a nap right amen they're we're going to see them listen now in the morning oh tomorrow morning see we're we're contain we're boxing ourselves in in the adoption series brother Bram says God is not a creature of time he does not look right the way you and I look so what I'm proposing to you this afternoon brothers and sisters is let's change the way we see that's right amen let's see we're creatures of time so we're on the inside of this thing looking out yeah you know we we spend trillions of dollars and we send telescopes out there and you know what they're looking for for God Amen they're looking for the beginning y they're looking for other civilizations other Earths other lives sustainable brothers and sisters we could have saved them as a matter of fact if I ask for a show of hands of who would like to divvy up the amount of money that say they just spent on the super telescope and give it to us who could give them the answer right they're looking for the God we serve sir Einstein was one of the few people brother brandham said in that sphere in that realm that admitted this has all got to have happened because of an in of an infinite being amen of course he didn't say Jehovah God but he recognized that somewhere out there is the center amen amen that's Center is centered right in your heart if he's living there at all and the only way he can live there is to have him had himself in there before time began so there is no end right amen that fulfills Revelations 10 for you and I time shall be no more oh the clock is still going to be moving the calendar is still going to be in the wall right but for the bride she's found the center of the universe and for her time means nothing absolutely nothing am now can we look from that perspective amen let's stop looking from the inside out and let's move outside the perimeter going beyond the camp and let's focus down on how God sees it amen amen because brothers and sisters that's what God is expecting out of you and me that's right amen I believe brother Mike again and I love referring to him because it's just so Dov Tales he talked about the the the he he he used a phrase I'm paraphrasing like the greatest uh uh event outside of Calvary I and I said brother Mike I put the word down yesterday in my notes before I ever come to church we are Co responsible yeah amen God has made you and me co- responsible amen for the other half of Calvary yes amen now we're not giving our lives for the sin of the world but what we are doing is we are taking the claim come on brother amen he paid the price but he never claimed brother Bram told us in the seal book you and I have been given the Reco responsibility what did I get that from you think marriage and divorce brother brandham said before the fall Eve was co-equal with Adam which was a type amen amen it was a type absolutely God wants you and I now to begin to look at his word from a different perspective we're not fighting flesh and blood so why would we want to use Flesh and Blood to to to oh well he said this and he said that yeah what we need to do is put on the mind of Christ amen amen now the mind of Christ was a special mind because Christ never bypassed his theophany amen you see he knew he might not have declared it all the time as you and I were talking brother Wade about men that have come and gone and and brother Brandon mingling with men how about Jesus Christ Judas the scariot same table he didn't kick him out of church right he didn't give him the boot you know how come cuz Judas was Sanctified so he had he had no premise to put him out yet he knew the son of predition look how sharp the devil is he climbs up into the Realms of sanctification so much so that he uses the same law that's going to condemn him according to the scripture if you live by the law you're going to die by the law and the devil uses the same law that's going to condemn him to try to bring you and I under condemnation true brother amen but we're still in the greatest battle ever fought and he ain't going to let up no I remember reading from this Pulpit one time a quote where brother Bram said he's going to be kicking and screaming while we toss him into the bottomless pit amen amen he's still going to be preaching his gospel he is amen yeah we're not fighting Flesh and Blood no God has called you and I to the highest Authority absolutely and that is to break the mold and break the hold that the devil has on the bride of Christ not the bride of Christ the way you and I think but the church the way she thinks right and that is to be to gain back the position that's right of co- equal having the mind of Christ is to believe it's not robbery right Amen to be equal with God now the pro the difference between between the bride of Christ and Lucifer is he doesn't want to be equal with God he wants to be above God he wants to sit in the house of God he wants everybody to worship him as he is God what do you think it's called Satan's zeden for what do you think it's called the God of this evil age for brothers and sisters you may not realize that each and every one of us in this room the devil is afraid of you yeah that's why as long as he can keep you and I fighting within ourselves he's got time yes he does that's that's it but I'm here to declare to you he's out of time yeah amen the Bride of Jesus Christ with the Eternal Word of God as her weapon that weapon is so powerful amen that weapon is so powerful I got to read it to you it's Hebrews 4:12 yes everybody knows these scriptures but listen to what the word the word of God is quick what's quick lifegiving yes amen it brings back to the life who who was singing Paul and Silas brings back to the life to the ones that's dead now i s there's a man in here so he fed 4,000 with just seven loaves of bread right amen right that's the God we serve yes amen that fulfills the scripture where Jesus said don't worry about where your next meal is coming from stop it we're so concerned we we we're focusing so much on on on the world the cosmos how much money we got how much we can make our Ambitions our education our scholarships there's nothing wrong with those things as long as they're kept in perspective but God should be number one always number one and who's number two not you you're number three Prophet said said your family yes right right family's number two and let me tell you something folks God keeps his word he is number one and he knows it he said there's only going to be one God and there ain't going to be no other gods before me and if you are my family you are number two yeah amen and in God's way of see you you and I are putting numbers on it but God is really telling you and I come on up yeah amen sit right next to me amen come on little Queen come on up and sit right next to me come on amen yeah and and and and and and if you'd like I'll tell you what I'll do I'll let you take it to the enemy yes yes Amen brother CU God's God he's already won he is the victory but he is Faith is our Victory yes sir that's right and that's the only way we're ever going to beat the enemy amen is by faith we heard it last night again oh you should have seen my notebook brother listen now Faith is the substance y it defeated hope yes see faith is the substance right those things that are hoped for are fine as brother Mike said until they get to a point where hope also relies on the element of Reason yeah yeah amen I hope it happens I hope it happens I hope so brother BR told us this is not a hope so religion this is a religion full of Faith amen is the evidence is that right faith is the substance yes faith is the evidence that what you don't see right now is waiting for you to bring it into existence by faith which is what the Bible says God did he formed and framed the worlds the universe right we need to get in the battle I was thinking about War I was thinking about battle I was thinking about fighting brother Wade and and and here's the way that you can fight the good fight and never doubt and never fear get in the fighten I'm I'm speaking from a witness brother Donnie when I before I was saved remember my daddy was a boxer when you're in the ring and the bell rings if you're afraid you've lost but what you've got to do is you've got to put your Reliance and your confidence in the trainer that trained you he he's he's watching your enemy he he knows and brother Brandon bring up sixc Smith and how he had the dream and so forth he knows the movements the style the stutters the steps the backwards the forward the left and the right the hook in the uppercut the right cross the knockout punch he knows it of the enemy so he's training you oh yeah too yeah amen that's right but he's also listen now it's not a matter of just defense in that training while you're figting the punches he tells you now he opens himself up when he gets in this when he steps just like this he's got this small opening give him an uppercut that's right it'll knock him out yeah come on he's got a glass jaw yeah amen GL amen no wonder why there's a sea of glass that's right Amen in the Bible judgment right brother amen brothers and sisters we're in we're in the driver's seat because God has introduce the driver's seat to you and I I believe we are a group of the people on this this planet there were 32,000 people ready and willing and able to go to battle in the days of Gideon and God said hold it he said uh this is what I want you to do Gideon I want you to go down to the flock there and I want you to make it clear to them that if there's anybody afraid if there's anybody doubtful y y if there's if there's anybody that's weak if there's anybody that like confidence I want you to tell them they can go home right you want me to use the word the Bible uses it's a return Ministry cuz he said tell him to return tell him to go back right amen and you know come on everybody has their weaknesses and it's like well I got my kids I got my job I got my you know I better I I okay God said God said it was okay so I'm going to I'm going to return that's the Bible uses it okay and they returned y the Bible says and then God said okay Gideon how many you got left I got 10,000 he said no no 10,000 isn't going to work here CU still the people of Israel are going to feel like they are yeah responsible yeah right did you get that yeah not co-responsible they're going to feel like they're responsible right for for the damage they do to the enemy yeah but we're not fighting Flesh and Blood here brothers and sisters you you ain't going to do to the devil like Israel done to their enemy right amen we don't have the ability to knock him out yeah but our trainer does amen and that's the Holy Ghost brother B told us yeah that's the teacher that's the instructor okay and isn't it does anybody ever found it curious in the Bible that that that that this the instructor is also the one who puts the seal on you oh it makes perfect sense to me when you're talking about training somebody you see the instructor takes you when when when when when you're moldable when when when when you can be manipulated and turned and twisted and and and and brought around and oh you're going to get brother Bram said in that dream why are you hit me so hard yeah right he said cuz I'm training you oh yeah yeah but she nearly knocked me out of the ring lifts me up a couple of feet off the ground he said he said I'm training you for something that's right amen and brother bab said I don't get it he said listen he said listen Billy he said when you get in there your opponent is every bit as tough as you are and he thinks he's better than you are and he thinks he's going to win and he thinks you're going to lose so the only defense you got is to be able to withstand his punches watch what he said because they stop the blood amen amen that's boxing you hit a man hard enough and it shocks his body and it stops momentarily the blood from flowing through his body but you got to recover instantly amen amen right see that's what the devil's trying to do he's trying to stop the blood amen he's trying to convince you by punching on you hard as he can that it's not worth it yeah on that it ain't working that that that what I'm trying to do is failing but there's Faith amen and faith says Nope the blood the blood that came from the cross and the body of Jesus Christ is the most powerful it's a sharp two-edged sword right amen you see because as the blood is the carrier of the life so is the word of God the word of God carries God's life in it it's a form of a carrier but where the prophet of God has brought you and I to today and the reason why we are the Overcomers of all seven stages of the journey amen you realize that each one of you by living in this age to get to the seventh stage of the journey has already overcome the six stages amen that's why the Sixth Seal was opened right because it was judgment and in the world you and I live in there are seven natural seals and there are seven spiritual seals amen the seven natural seals pertain to Israel and the church the seven Supernatural spiritual seals pertain to you and I and where do we find them at on the back of the book amen oh God knows what he's doing he knows how to train us I want you to notice there something about the book The Seven spiritual seals are here now a seal shows both sides so the seven that are out here are also imprinted in here has every anybody ever seen a seal from their uh notary public where they squeeze the paper and it shows the indentation on the paper flip the paper over y right it shows both sides that's an official seal yeah amen if it only shows on one side it can be counterfeit amen you can counterfeit the new notary public stamp oh yeah come on I can order one I just like the one that you got but you can't order God's sealen because it makes an imprint so solid you know brother bandam says when when a man pulls that woman up against him that is going to be his wife that she makes an imprint on him that that's the kind of seal that's represented by you and me God had us in him before the foundation of the world and it has made an imprint amen it has made more than just an impression it has left marks it has left numbers it has left words it has left lines it has left jots and titles and not one of those will pass away noen brothers and sisters We Are the Champions yes we are amen if we'll be willing to submit co-responsibility to God it's not us doing it amen I want you to notice something about the the battle that Gideon was going to partake of as the leader 10,000 were left oh well you know everybody's pretty comfortable with it 10 grand you know 10,000 maybe that person will go and I'll make it maybe that person will get injured and I won't I'll stay in the middle of everybody and that way everybody on the outside gets it God said thought you'd say that so I'll tell you what I'm going to do Gideon I want you now I'm going to do the separating the the first time God told him what to say but the second time he says now I'm going to do the separating get in you just follow my instructions right huh right he said now listen take them all down to the water hole all 10,000 of them down they have the 22,000 left it's 32,000 and went down to 10,000 because 22,000 left and 10,000 were left and God had a number in his now Gideon didn't know Gideon did not know that number no take him down to the watering hole so it's a type brother Wade take him down to the water what is the water a type of take him down to the spirit let's get where where did Judas show his colors amen The Watering Hole yep Pentecost yeah cuz water is a type of the spirit and he took him they they they marched all down he said now now here's the deal he didn't know how many he said you take account of those that lap the water like a dog and take account of those who' be now now you you and I would think the people that got down on their knees would be oh they're in yeah uhuh no you ain't fighting down here no unless you get to the war room right amen yeah that's the infirmary by the way amen that little room off the side of the tent yeah amen I'm teasing you for tomorrow what the angel tell brother brandham I don't understand brother Bram said that closet he said it's scriptural go into your closet and pray I ain't going to tell you what the word closet means yet it's an infirmary though we find that out in the vision right and if you're going to go to battle you say well nobody's going to get injured we're talking about the perverted birth yeah right amen aren't we yes but how many people brother wadeer in their Doctrine absolutely amen how many churches are paralyzed yes amen how many churches have lost one of their limbs to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and we find out that an arm as brother Mike said represents power but in the dictionary it's a limb what's a limb behold my servant the branch yes right amen Zechariah and Isaiah absolutely and then you go over and find out that Jesus said in St John I'm the vine you're the limbs you're the arms you're the branches you're the power you're the ones that I'm going to reveal myself to in such a way amen you're going to believe this report and God knew it because something down on the inside of you brothers and sisters I got nothing to do with it except I am the carrier right amen right of that life but let me tell you what God has done for you and me in closing he has made a way where the carrier and the life become one amen father make them one as we are one amen see he's not talking about the Oneness that's being preached through the churches oh come on brother we all need to get together all get together with you like Mya got together yeah you want to get together around the word of God revealed I'm there yeah amen but don't call me into some social services Mickey Mouse yeah unqualified disqualified unauthorized group of people amen amen I'm busy fighting amen and I'm not fighting flesh and blood but listen you take the wrong people into battle with you you're going to find yourself come on y stuck usually in the back yes but stuck yes sir brothers and sisters we ain't got time for that this is the hour we heard it last night we are on the threshold of whipping the devil 100% so much so that he is bound by a chain amen of circumstances that's what the prophet that's a chain of circumstance for a thousand years so we can rest what are we going to rest for a thousand years for battle's not over yeah not you're right we get to go to a supper and a battle and a battle and a supper look what happened to Abraham after the battle was was over Abraham had MDC show up and they did some communion and then there was another little Gap in there and then they had the Lord's Supper yeah and guess who mzc is the pillar of fire huh what does the bible tell us when Joshua met the captain of the host of the Lord and by the word the word host is where they got the word Army from so a host is an army yes and we've seen in in in in in Psalms 27 they talked about a host there's an army amen 200,000,000 demons y there are my wife and I were recently at some meetings where brother Doug Baker did a little math y'all know he's a rocket scientist so he's real sharp retired and he did the math brother Wade and he he kind of used the numbers like brother brandham said if there's one in a million and there's this many million and and he got down to how many Christians there would be on the earth and then he divided up 200,000,000 into there's like 30 38,000 demons on each one of you fighting you you know I mean they're after you right amen I don't mean they're in you they're after you amen y if that math it okay so let's say he overshot the target brother wait and let's say there's 10,000 yeah right a piece it doesn't matter one of them is enough amen and if you got one and you kick him out he goes and gets his friends cuz he's coming back to fight for his place you know why because the angels that did not believe Michael's message left their first estate and they'd like to have it back now right they went out there and wandered around and said like the prodigal I got a place that I used to live in and this guy worked and he made good money and he took showers and he ate good food and I don't like living out here in the pigy yeah and and his buddies said where's that come on seven more come on let me take you and show you but if that house is filled with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords the captain of the host of the Lord that Joshua was so Joshua was not intimidated why cuz he put all his confidence in God's word cuz God's God told him Joshua listen now you're going to go to battle you're going to be the greatest General The Greatest Warrior I've ever had and what I want you to do is take me at my word Joshua and I want you to believe me and he already knew Joshua was going to believe him we heard that last night because the life of God was responding back and forth see he said you do it exactly the way my word says and you'll never lose brother brandom used it he said wouldn't it be nice to fight a war and not have the Red Cross not have the hospitals not need the doctors and the bandages and and not lose any blood or no Flesh Wounds nothing see what carried Joshua was his confidence in God's word he went into battle and think about this brothers and sisters let's say you're a person with one sword and you're facing 50 Philistines 100 200 and in your soul the word of God has declared you can't get injured right come on W come you're the baddest man on the battlefield cuz you don't have anything or anybody to be afraid of you're not worried about Who's Got Your Back N cuz God's got your back oh yeah you're just taking the sword and you're mowing down the enemy like Samson did with a jaw bone an ass amen think about it that's the kind of confidence you and I are expected to place in God's word amen and when he met the captain of the host of the Lord the C he said who are you for us are are you for our enemies yeah I I want you to know he didn't say are you for us or against us he said are you for us are you for our enemies who side are you on Amen Joshua I can just imagine and the host the captain of the host had his draw s his sword drawn right right as soon as he spoke you see because the spoken word is always the original se he told Joshua who he was and he said Joshua take your shoes off for the ground you're standing on is who said that before in the Bible the pillar of Fire that was in the burning bush said that now you and I have access to the same Pillar of Fire but now it's not the captain of the host of the Lord on the outside it's the Lord himself on the inside and when you draw his word with the faith that you should have in it you're you're an invincible Army yeah amen please stand woo God is good amen all the time see that's the attitude we got to have it's it's not it's not enough to say God it's all the time praise God Amen as the musicians come you already know I can't sing but I like to sing amen God is good all the time [Music] you better help me once we get going I'll go with you good all the time he

give the Lord a hand clap our brother wonderful job amen glory great job for us today thank you brother Chris for yielding yourself to the Lord yeah last night we were all just kind of looking at each other and and I knew that sister Joan and brother Chris they were they knew that what Chris had preached before and I knew that that he was right on the beating in the same plowing in the same field so so we knew we were going to get a little extra that today so we sure appreciate and that's got to be God it's not a coincidence that you read the same scripture and a brother that's 2500 miles away comes and preaches for you and he preaches the same thing you preach but brings it in a little different way a little different angle but it's all one word of God you know I was thinking while he was preaching this devil that that that he's talking about the advis all right the adversary he is right that's right God created him first physically created him first to be the worship Angel to to do his bidding stay in his position yeah but he didn't that's right Bible says iniquity was found in his heart he wanted to be above God he don't want to be God he wanted to be above God sure he wants to slide himself in and be like God and then sit in the temple of God showing himself to be as God but you know all that he's done you got that right chrisan what a waste of time all that he's done he never will touch something you have that's right as powerful as we think that the devil is we say the devil this and devil that no he's the right-hand man of God but he's fell and he's this and he's that and he's all over the world making people do stuff there's one thing he can't have that me and you have right here today if you're born again you have eternal life he was created and he's going to have an End Amen that's right and sure you had a time when you come down here and you were created in the womb of your mama and you came here on Earth but like Chris said before the foundation of the world that seat of God was up there and as I told the church Day sister Joanna don't ever say God don't like me or God hates me or God don't let if God ever loved you one time it's he can't change his mind he can't change his mind if he loved you one time amen if he says I love you Jesus said like you said make us one right as we are one in other words put us all back together again right right that's what we're doing so what power does Satan have he cannot touch your soul if you're born again it's something listen that's territory that as brother R said I was talking to last night brother R said he said you know get to a place to where Satan don't even know what to do with you see he's got thinks he's got this thing all figured out he thinks he's got this thing all figured out he's going to come down he's going to anoint a group of people and they're going to do what he said right and that's what happens to probably seven and a half or 7.9 billion people in the world on but there's one group of people that's right oh he can play he can have battles but he can't touch your soul if you're born again that's right he can't even go where you're going as I said at the funeral the other day death the death angel didn't take my daddy across CU he passed Jesus said you have passed from Death un life when you don't like something sister Joanna if he he likes dunky Donuts but if if if you didn't like Dunkey Donuts you pass right by it right oh no no I know you wouldn't but oh no you need to we'll get you some Dunkin Donut before you leave but what if you don't like something what you do you pass right by it yes that's what Jesus said you have passed right from Death un life so a death angel don't come and get a Christian oh no no no Michael comes and gets the Christians that's right he makes sure as Brother Richard Wilson boy I'm telling you I want to I want to put that quote down Brother Richard said brother Dale knew where to go when he passed he preached himself right into that place amen amen there's many people um I've always said the pope if he's not converted and these jihadist that's going to get these virgins when they pass away they have a real bad moment when they step over into another place cuz they're lost they don't know where they're at they think this is what they're going to get they're going to get you know be in the have 72 virgins and and the Pope says well I'm God here I'm I I'll be God over there no but you and I this is so real yes even eternity is so real on this side till if we do have to step over on the other side we just step right into eternity and it's not something that we have to that's why Paul said death where's your stain grave where's your victory we have all things through Jesus Christ because we passed from death into life can't kill a Christian we can kill the devil though like like I hope I hope we're there where we can all get a good swift kick when we kick him into that bottomless pit never to see him again but thank God we got a heavenly father that we're going to see for an eternity and we'll be able to commune with him and talk with he's not going to be somewhere Untouchable where we can't get to him he's not going to be setting up on a hill maybe he is but you going to be right there with him if you need to be oh praise God thank God for the word of God that we have in this end time that we can understand these things that the question mark has been taken out of the lot of a lot of things just because God sent us a prophet amen he sent us a prophet to get up to to be able to see these things and then what did he do he called us to come up and do the same thing he didn't leave us down here looking up no he said come up a little higher amen come up be eaglets he said your little eaglets so guess what we can fly too amen so we can get up and we can see Revelation and and understand things that that the the the world don't even understand you ask somebody sometimes what happens when you die oh it's horrible bad you know bad bad well if they knew God it wouldn't be that's right right right just a portal brother R said what was it a vehicle to take him from here to there put him in the presence of the Lord so thank God for brother Chris coming and preaching for us today we sure appreciate that thank you all for coming I think the truck's out there so let them get I trying to give them a little bit of time and um I got here about 4:30 so what's going to happen now is you need to if you want to do your kids first you do whatever you want to do but there will
