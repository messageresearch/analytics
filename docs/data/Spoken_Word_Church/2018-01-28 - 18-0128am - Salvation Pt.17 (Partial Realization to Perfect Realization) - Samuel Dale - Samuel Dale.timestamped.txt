[4:30] turn in your scriptures turn to where
[4:34] we've been dealing with Jonah 2 and 9
[4:38] and 10 and then we're going to Hebrews
[4:40] 10 good to see the visitors with us this
[4:43] morning we always say to you when you
[4:46] come here one time you're a visitor you
[4:48] come two times you're just part of us
[4:50] because we don't have anything to join
[4:52] up with we just part of the body of
[4:54] Christ we've got a lot of sickness among
[4:56] us now so remember to pray for each one
[5:00] my wife she's having troubles they gave
[5:02] her some antibiotics the other day to
[5:04] try to help her with her congestion and
[5:07] things and it just reverted different
[5:09] and gave her headaches and she's been
[5:11] having trouble with that for a few days
[5:12] and not able to sleep or anything else
[5:15] so just pray at the Lord we would touch
[5:17] her it take care of remember - this
[5:20] coming Saturday will be the Bible study
[5:23] so remember that got a long list coming
[5:27] down so remember each one brother direct
[5:30] called an old Terrance had already
[5:32] covered these but he called from the
[5:34] Philippines and I don't know where the
[5:36] his brother-in-law is over there over
[5:39] here we don't know which way but his
[5:41] brother Dan all passed away and so just
[5:44] remember to pray for that now sister
[5:47] Janet helm as far as we know life's
[5:50] notice they're supposed to operate on
[5:52] her tomorrow for gallbladder she had a
[5:54] an attack yesterday and everything but
[5:58] they thought it might have been in the
[5:59] heart they run her through everything
[6:01] everything was okay but they did say
[6:04] that she had gallbladder problems and so
[6:07] just remember that
[6:09] - brother Louise
[6:13] he's over preaching for brother gene
[6:15] Williams
[6:16] today so remember that and pray for him
[6:19] - Lord would bless him take care of him
[6:21] Lord willing brother Bob will be
[6:23] preaching for us this coming Wednesday
[6:25] he's back there in the office getting a
[6:29] getting the message because what I said
[6:31] I got a whole lot of different ones so
[6:33] if I leave anybody out don't don't think
[6:36] I done it but we just brother Daugherty
[6:38] will be starting treatments there
[6:42] sometime maybe this week or 1st of next
[6:44] week so remember that I guess that's
[6:48] pretty close to all of them at least
[6:50] enough anyway so gives you something to
[6:52] pray for all right but just for if the
[6:55] Lord would bless all of these and we
[6:57] know that around the world even today
[6:59] everybody I was reading the other day
[7:01] where there were so many cases of just
[7:05] colds and flus and stuff like that in
[7:08] the United States that were just really
[7:10] from what I'm looking at it was almost
[7:12] everybody in the whole thing was sick of
[7:14] one thing or another you know there's so
[7:16] much going because that's the day in the
[7:19] hour that we're living all right father
[7:23] we thank you for your grace and your
[7:25] love Lord and we thank you for all
[7:27] things and we pray that you would just
[7:29] bless us now as we speak about you Lord
[7:32] and we pray that as we speak about you
[7:35] then you would come upon the scene and
[7:38] there our hearts and our lives and
[7:40] quicken your word unto us and Lord if
[7:43] you'd got us we know you said in your
[7:45] word that you sent your word and healed
[7:47] us and delivered us from destruction so
[7:50] we believe it for all of these that are
[7:51] sick and operations they're facing and
[7:54] different things that are taking place
[7:56] we pray that you be with each one and
[7:59] let your love be made manifest and Lord
[8:02] forgive our sins because we want to be
[8:04] covered and just kept into thy grace
[8:06] have your way we love you and we thank
[8:09] you in Jesus name
[8:14] Jonah we've been speaking about
[8:17] salvation so we've been reading this
[8:19] from the Book of Jonah 2 and 9 but I
[8:23] will sacrifice unto
[8:26] the with a voice of Thanksgiving I will
[8:29] pay that that I have vowed salvation is
[8:33] of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the
[8:36] feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the
[8:39] dry land let's go to Hebrews I hope we
[8:44] can get over into this enough but
[8:47] Hebrews 10 I wish you would read 9nt and
[8:52] we might pick up a little bit of it in a
[8:53] little bit but it would give you a
[8:55] better thought of what we're trying to
[8:58] bring Hebrews 10 one for the law having
[9:02] a shadow of good things to come and not
[9:06] the very image of the things can never
[9:09] with those sacrifices they offered year
[9:12] by year continually make the comers
[9:15] thereunto perfect now Washington let's
[9:18] seize all of that is back there they
[9:20] shattered under the law and the things
[9:22] you know that it couldn't do it couldn't
[9:25] keep it now you don't have to turn to do
[9:27] it but all I want to read in between
[9:29] here of Hebrews 9 and verse 8 he's
[9:33] talking about the Holy Ghost signifying
[9:35] that the way into the holiest of all
[9:38] way-o was not yet made manifest while
[9:42] the first Tabernacle was yet standing
[9:44] all right we'll get back to that in a
[9:47] minute but just bringing into that
[9:49] Scripture all right verse 2 for then
[9:51] would not day how ceased to be offered
[9:54] see if it done if it worked you would
[9:56] only had it one time right then would
[10:00] have ceased to be offered because that
[10:02] the worshiper once purged from heard
[10:04] should have had no more conscience of
[10:07] sins but in these sacrifices there is a
[10:12] remembrance again made us sins every
[10:15] year in other words it had to make a
[10:16] sacrifice ever year right it wasn't just
[10:20] a one you can go on down through the
[10:22] description find out Jesus Christ died
[10:24] once for all to take care of it alright
[10:27] but we're not getting to that point
[10:29] we're trying to hold to and verse 4 says
[10:32] for it is not possible that the blood of
[10:35] bulls and goats should take away sins
[10:37] you may be seated the Lord had
[10:39] blessing to the reading of the word now
[10:43] trying to bring a point that will be
[10:51] very valuable later on as we begin to
[10:56] speak about salvation speak about the
[11:01] new birth because that's where we're
[11:02] going on into we're going into the new
[11:05] birth we're going in to the things of
[11:08] the scriptures that you must be born
[11:10] again we're going out into adoption the
[11:13] Lord willing and where was Wade was
[11:16] saying their last Sunday he said you
[11:19] know daddy's doing this and I'm doing
[11:21] that if you take what we're doing I'm
[11:24] down here below this is the new birth
[11:28] I'm down here trying to come up to here
[11:30] he's up here trying to go on up that way
[11:32] so it'll all tie together if you just
[11:37] listen and think about the things that
[11:39] are saying because he's in the seals and
[11:41] going on into things and maybe one of
[11:45] these days I'll get ready and start up a
[11:47] little bit and move up kind of to the
[11:50] understanding arm but now remember what
[11:54] we've been talking about we've been
[11:59] talking about the fact that the Old
[12:01] Testament it had a form of salvation but
[12:09] that form of salvation was under the
[12:12] blood of bulls and goats right and Jesus
[12:17] Christ had not been crucified and that's
[12:20] why I read that Scripture in Hebrews
[12:22] nine and eight that while that
[12:25] Tabernacle while that atonement was in
[12:28] place of the Old Testament they had to
[12:32] go back and do over every year offer
[12:34] offerings every year but see when you
[12:37] come to the New Testament and you come
[12:39] to Jesus Christ you find that if he
[12:42] offered once for all see so he paid for
[12:45] all of the sins of the Old Testament
[12:47] because that back tire was that those
[12:51] sins could not be told
[12:53] annihilated they could only be covered
[12:56] by the blood of bulls and goats because
[12:58] there was no life in the animal to be
[13:00] able to come back up on the believer to
[13:03] cleanse him and make him right but it
[13:06] was a capo as you call it a covering to
[13:09] her that it pushed all of those sins of
[13:12] mankind was pushed over to Calvary and
[13:16] that's why I said that scripture says he
[13:18] awful was offered once alright he paid
[13:21] the price for all of it we'd had to come
[13:24] over to that time or while it was in
[13:27] existence of the Old Testament see then
[13:31] they were under a partial realization of
[13:36] salvation we'll get to that later in the
[13:40] message trying to bring out they were
[13:41] under what we were using the words
[13:44] potential or potentially they because it
[13:50] was speaking of what was to come
[13:53] all right so we know that John 739
[13:59] speaks of Jesus Christ and it says that
[14:03] the way in and other words up to the
[14:06] Holy of Holies let's just read that and
[14:07] then we'll get it they don't have to
[14:10] pull it up at will we'll get this John
[14:17] 1:7 alright I want these two scriptures
[14:21] put together with you the one in the
[14:23] Hebrews where it says you know that they
[14:26] couldn't it didn't change so I want
[14:28] these to read together but it says in in
[14:30] John 7 and 39 but this spake he of the
[14:37] Spirit which today that believe on him
[14:41] should receive now listen for the Holy
[14:45] Ghost was not yet given because that
[14:49] Jesus was not yet glorified so in the
[14:54] Old Testament now keep that and read it
[14:57] with the word we were in in Hebrews all
[15:00] right read it where we were in Hebrews 9
[15:04] and verse 8 the Holy Ghost does
[15:06] signifying verse 7 talks about the
[15:09] priests going in and offering the
[15:11] sacrifices for the errors of the people
[15:14] the Holy Ghost
[15:15] this signified that the way into the
[15:18] holiest of all was not yet made manifest
[15:21] while as the first test tabernacle was
[15:26] yet standing right now so we know that
[15:29] you know we always talk about Old
[15:32] Testament New Testament all right and we
[15:35] talk about doing those praying at the
[15:38] park and I I'd like to say that because
[15:41] you know you can say to most people you
[15:44] know turn to the first book of the New
[15:46] Testament they'll turn to Matthew well
[15:50] let's see Matthew is not the first book
[15:52] of the New Testament
[15:53] yeah but brother Dale it says in my
[15:55] Bible he says right there New Testament
[15:58] you know well that doesn't mean it that
[16:02] way it just means that's where mankind
[16:04] put it because that's what he thought
[16:05] the first book of the New Testament is
[16:08] the book of Acts because the Bible said
[16:11] to testator see there was no way to have
[16:16] a New Testament until you had to death
[16:17] of the testator right you can't have a
[16:21] New Testament until the death of that
[16:26] testator and I always make it plain like
[16:28] this people say oh see we Baptist was oh
[16:31] we're not under the Old Testament the
[16:33] Lord we're under the New Testament you
[16:36] know well we were out over here in this
[16:38] New Testament and they always ask him
[16:41] say well heard that start well it starts
[16:43] - Matthew now as I say in our last week
[16:46] see the Bible says in Galatians our that
[16:48] Jesus Christ you know there was no way
[16:53] he could be the testator until he died
[16:57] it had to be he had to give his life all
[17:00] right and then giving his life and being
[17:03] the would could start a New Testament
[17:05] but yet while he was here he was still
[17:09] under the Old Testament law when he
[17:13] heals a person there
[17:15] he said go all for the sacrifice of
[17:17] Moses they do you understand what I'm
[17:20] talking about
[17:20] see we just say New Testament and we
[17:24] said well Matthew's a New Testament now
[17:26] the Bible says that Jesus was came under
[17:29] the law to redeem them that were under
[17:32] the law he had to give the sacrifices of
[17:37] the Old Testament law as we call it
[17:40] because it was still in being while he
[17:43] was alive well season trying to get a
[17:49] point see that we're looking back there
[17:51] and seeing something as a partial
[17:54] realization are seeing it as then to the
[17:59] point that it's potentially which
[18:07] potentially is something that is not
[18:11] fully in the manifestation
[18:13] now when you say potential that means
[18:17] something that could happen or may
[18:19] happen I could do no that's not the word
[18:22] potentially potentially it's like what
[18:27] I've tried to bring to you you ask for
[18:29] an old tree I give you an acorn
[18:33] you have the life of the old tree and
[18:36] now listen there's no way to get an oak
[18:40] tree without an acre
[18:43] all right you got it there's no way to
[18:47] get an oak tree when I went down yeah I
[18:51] didn't get a necklace no but somebody
[18:53] planted that and the care of it right
[18:56] because there's no way to get an oak
[18:58] tree unless you start with an acorn the
[19:01] guy worked one time he kept telling me
[19:03] how that pecans was that casserole that
[19:06] was hanging off of the tree you know and
[19:10] he said that's the seed of the pecan I
[19:12] said I'll make an agreement with you
[19:15] I said you plant that pastor what you
[19:20] want to call it and you put it in the
[19:21] ground I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna
[19:24] because I knew it wouldn't break but I
[19:26] said I knew how to do it I said I'm
[19:28] gonna crack up pecan
[19:29] where it will do it faster where we can
[19:31] get it through and if someone put this
[19:33] in some dirt and I'll bring you a little
[19:36] pecan tree when I said you bring me up a
[19:39] country off of that tie so that you got
[19:41] well he found out in the hurry that
[19:43] didn't work you've got to go back to the
[19:46] seed of something so then my points out
[19:50] been what for many services whatever you
[19:53] start with you got to end with a same
[19:57] time whatever salvation it was in the
[20:00] Old Testament which was won by the blood
[20:03] of the bulls and goats right spoke off
[20:09] when Jesus Christ would come for the
[20:12] blood of Jesus Christ to be the perfect
[20:14] one because there was no life in the
[20:16] bull than go-sees can come back upon the
[20:19] believer all right so then it was only
[20:21] potential back tyre which meant it was
[20:25] good it was wrong wonderful but it was
[20:28] waiting for a time to be fully made
[20:32] manifest or his brother least was
[20:35] talking about wind see when you get into
[20:38] that word perfect you know and you begin
[20:41] to look up those words and you find out
[20:43] perfect means a full age are complete
[20:47] all right see then we look at the Bible
[20:50] we say well nobody can be perfect
[20:53] would Jesus said be ye therefore perfect
[20:55] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[20:57] huh
[20:58] now he required it so you're saying we
[21:00] can't be it then you're saying he's
[21:02] wrong how'd he do it he didn't he gave
[21:07] his own life think the one that was
[21:09] totally fully complete gave His life to
[21:14] be able to come back into you and I to
[21:16] make us complete all right are a full
[21:19] age come on then follow the point now
[21:23] they said you asked me for an oak tree
[21:26] I'll give you an acorn you have
[21:29] potentially the oak tree but you've got
[21:34] to plan it you guys got to have water
[21:37] it's got how the moisture and then
[21:39] things like that it's got out of the Sun
[21:41] to bring it forward and make an oak tree
[21:43] out
[21:44] well that's the way it was in the Old
[21:46] Testament salvation all of those
[21:51] sacrifices spoke of the coming of the
[21:55] Lord Jesus Christ right all of those
[22:00] animals that were sacrificed
[22:02] spoke of the coming of Jesus Christ and
[22:06] what it was doing was just pushing the
[22:08] sin forward not totally annihilating it
[22:13] because there was no way under the blood
[22:15] of bulls and goats cuz it was why did
[22:18] Jesus have to die he said well it could
[22:20] be this one no no just get plain
[22:21] sensible Jesus Christ would have never
[22:24] had to died if you could do some
[22:27] perfection without him coming so you
[22:29] can't do it alright that solves a
[22:31] problem I don't care what you think you
[22:33] say well I think well that's what he
[22:34] said in the garden see that's what
[22:36] messed it up get the truth and settle it
[22:39] in your mind there's no way in that Old
[22:42] Testament that life could come forth in
[22:46] the reality of perfection we're gonna
[22:50] read in a minute we're brethren said the
[22:52] prophets only had the Holy Ghost
[22:55] potentially see because that was not
[23:02] into the right place but get what I'm
[23:04] talking about if you're wanting this to
[23:06] Ray to bring something into reality
[23:09] you've got to bring the seed of it a
[23:13] beginning a starting and then it can be
[23:17] brought into reality and when it's
[23:20] brought into reality you know what I
[23:21] like now let me let me say it the way
[23:27] you you'll understand it are you
[23:31] listening you own an oak tree I'll give
[23:36] you an acorn right
[23:42] is that true now that's the only way to
[23:46] get the oak tree right but you know what
[23:48] you're not gonna get just one oh come
[23:55] come on ever oak tree that will ever be
[24:01] come on let's with Apple where you'll
[24:04] follow it right when you take a seed of
[24:08] an apple and you plant it in the ground
[24:11] it grows up makes a start comes forth
[24:14] you know it makes a tree do you realize
[24:17] every bushel of apples that will ever be
[24:20] come out of that seed put one oak tree
[24:26] you know what anchored in the ground
[24:30] millions of oak trees will come from
[24:33] that one acorn so you ought to think
[24:35] about that it's not a potential like we
[24:38] just said we'll see you're saying well
[24:40] you're trying to make it something that
[24:42] it's not you're making it too small
[24:43] how much greater could I make it 1 oak
[24:49] tree one acorn millions of oak trees are
[24:54] you following it seem to make it where
[24:57] your father what the Prophet said one
[24:59] seed of an apple put it in the ground
[25:01] and every bushel of apples that'll ever
[25:03] be on there comes from that one seed so
[25:09] potential is not just well if Norina
[25:12] said don't do don't do potential as much
[25:16] you do is you do potentially because
[25:19] when you just saying potential you'll
[25:21] run aground cuz it can mean not the real
[25:24] thing but potentially you've got your
[25:28] oak tree they had salvation back during
[25:33] the Old Testament but it was based upon
[25:38] their faith and their believing in the
[25:45] blood of the animal that took their
[25:48] place and their salvation was based upon
[25:52] that that they could believe that
[25:56] that the atonement was made for them go
[26:00] read the songs getting there where David
[26:02] cries out in his heart Lord returned me
[26:05] into the joy of thy salvation if you
[26:08] think that they wouldn't repentant
[26:10] sinners and the Old Testament you had a
[26:12] bad thing if you can't read you know
[26:14] read your Bible and see how they cried
[26:16] out before God continually nor take away
[26:20] these things which there was nothing to
[26:22] take it away that's why they had to
[26:26] offer this offerings and keep on
[26:29] offering the offerings because there was
[26:34] no way to take away that that caused
[26:36] them to be like they were but yet they
[26:40] were good people right really probably
[26:46] loved wives they probably lived a better
[26:49] life than you and I do
[26:50] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost why
[26:54] because they were concerned they knew if
[26:58] they done anything wrong they had to go
[27:00] to the high priest they had to go
[27:02] confess they had to go make it right
[27:05] they had to go pay the penalty that went
[27:08] with it
[27:08] are the to make an atonement see they
[27:13] had a salvation back there and like I
[27:15] said to you over and over that salvation
[27:17] of the Old Testament so great it
[27:19] provided a place for them to go to once
[27:22] they died they went to a place called
[27:27] paradise the bosom of Abraham and they
[27:31] stayed there until the resurrection of
[27:33] Jesus Christ and still some of it is
[27:36] still left even til now because the
[27:38] Bible didn't say they said it it didn't
[27:40] say everybody that raised it said part
[27:43] of them did all right so you say well
[27:46] now know the old oh no no no that was
[27:50] done away with well then you you're
[27:51] fighting one scripture with the other
[27:53] one because the other scripture says
[27:55] that everybody didn't rise see that's
[27:59] where we want to get our thoughts we're
[28:02] smart enough now in the message wise
[28:04] until we've studied it until we're
[28:07] getting our thoughts too
[28:09] into a basis that we think we got it
[28:12] figured out well if it won't let with
[28:15] the rest of the scripture where you have
[28:19] it right see that that's the point I'm
[28:24] trying to get you to look at something
[28:26] because we see it there it's all based
[28:28] upon your believing salvation is based
[28:33] upon your believing you've got to
[28:37] believe that Jesus Christ died for your
[28:39] sin I just said what we all take it cuz
[28:43] I believe that you know everybody says
[28:44] it so I believe that no you got to have
[28:46] a personal experience alright we'll get
[28:49] to those things but listen salvation
[28:53] back there was based upon faith in the
[28:57] blood of the Lamb that paid the price
[29:04] enough to cover it but not to eradicate
[29:09] it because we did what is Jesus after
[29:13] die but it couldn't eradicate it but it
[29:20] could potentially cover it until that
[29:26] potential the important he had started
[29:29] with would come out to a reality which
[29:31] would be coming out to the blood of
[29:33] Jesus Christ see now when it comes to
[29:37] the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of
[29:39] Jesus Christ is not a potential it's not
[29:42] potentially you're not potentially saved
[29:45] when you come to the blood of Jesus
[29:47] Christ but now when you talk about
[29:50] statute of a perfect man when you talk
[29:52] about adoption those things will be
[29:55] going through then you can see there
[29:57] still is potentially a lot of things so
[30:01] the random said Luther and Wesley and
[30:03] him was only potential oh well they
[30:06] didn't hell don't know he says now wait
[30:08] a minute I'm not saying that it now the
[30:10] Holy Ghost I'm looking at quotes if you
[30:11] want they learn on my desk I'll get to
[30:15] him later what what is it why would he
[30:17] say Luther and Wesley and him had a
[30:19] potential because it was potential
[30:23] the part of the word but it was only
[30:26] justification right it was only
[30:30] justification so they would have it
[30:33] potentially waiting for the Holy Ghost
[30:36] to come to bring the word in the last
[30:38] days all right
[30:39] we'll get to those things as we go along
[30:41] but now watch we ended up last Sunday
[30:45] speaking of partial realization
[30:50] comparing it to perfect realization all
[30:54] right now let's use what we're talking
[30:56] about potentially and let's use it as
[31:00] types and shadows that we did last
[31:02] Sunday and then use it as partial
[31:05] realization compared to perfect
[31:07] realization all right so now what is
[31:11] partial realization it's a part of
[31:14] something it's not the fullness of that
[31:16] it's a part of that all right so when
[31:20] Jesus Christ now I'm looking into church
[31:22] age book reading it basically also when
[31:24] Jesus Christ when the Old Testament lamb
[31:28] was slain that was potentially because
[31:35] it could not come forth in reality but
[31:37] when it come in Jesus Christ it was
[31:39] perfect realization right all right see
[31:44] then that would be the same thing as
[31:45] types and at the top that would be why
[31:50] Jesus said I'm the bread that comes down
[31:57] from heaven and they said no now Moses
[32:04] gave us that brief he said the word
[32:11] Moses never gave you anything I gave you
[32:14] that I am the bread you need to eat you
[32:18] saying see partial realization was the
[32:21] bread in the wilderness remember it
[32:24] rotten it done all kind of things but
[32:27] perfect realization Jesus is the bread
[32:29] that comes from heaven to sustain us all
[32:32] in our salvation all right partial
[32:36] realization
[32:36] and perfect realization types and
[32:39] shadows you know type back there there's
[32:43] being a shadow of something to come it's
[32:47] not fully there in the top but yet it
[32:51] spoke of in the top and it's partial
[32:53] realization all right so then
[32:56] potentially that's what we're recovering
[33:02] potentially the Old Testament people had
[33:06] salvation but now remember I keep
[33:11] explaining how to don't you to go off on
[33:13] the wrong end or other Dale don't
[33:14] believe them Old Testament people that
[33:16] any salvation now that's where you're
[33:18] wrong you're not listening you're not
[33:20] listening what I'm saying you want to
[33:22] listen to refute what I'm saying to you
[33:24] you're arguing in your mind I'm not
[33:28] asking you to blank your mind I could
[33:30] run around said don't ever do that right
[33:33] you know what a lot of people say come
[33:34] on black your mind out and receive what
[33:36] I'm say I never have said none like it
[33:38] because I found what the Prophet said he
[33:40] said the devil wants you to blank your
[33:42] mind out no think about what I'm saying
[33:46] don't blank your mind out onto something
[33:48] or get on to some other thought in your
[33:50] mind just listen and see if it's right
[33:56] she's in that salvation back there was
[33:59] for that time but it will not do today
[34:04] the blood of bulls and goats won't work
[34:07] today well because you've changed
[34:11] dispensations you've got the death of
[34:14] the testator you've got all of the
[34:16] things in view and you coming to perfect
[34:18] realization or understanding of
[34:21] salvation see then that salvation back
[34:27] tyre was based upon their faith in God
[34:33] what is your salvation based on he said
[34:40] well my salvation based on blood Jesus
[34:41] Christ it's not that didn't go through
[34:45] too good it it's supposed to be based on
[34:48] the blood of Jesus Christ paying the
[34:51] price because the life was in the blood
[34:57] right see that's where you go oh you're
[34:59] not in the blood no more the life was in
[35:01] the blood without the shedding of blood
[35:03] there was no shedding of the life all
[35:08] right now see then the lamb as it laid
[35:13] there and was sacrificed in our place
[35:17] God looked at that lamb and said okay
[35:22] you're covered but that lamb had no soul
[35:27] it was alive right it was alive but it
[35:33] had no soul to come back up on the
[35:35] believer all right see then it would
[35:39] take Jesus Christ to come himself to
[35:41] take our place all right the animal is
[35:44] not a living soul it only speaks of
[35:50] today so you're the only speaker back
[35:53] there it was working it it doesn't mean
[35:55] that time don't lose that yeah I can go
[36:00] through a lot more with you if you want
[36:01] to honey but I mean really yeah we think
[36:05] oh they just done and done and done you
[36:07] better remember under that Old Testament
[36:11] they wanted a law and they thought it
[36:16] made them righteous but you know what it
[36:18] does it made a record come on
[36:22] the law made a record now come on you
[36:28] say oh you just commit adultery and then
[36:31] the next year you just commit adultery
[36:32] and the next year you commit adultery
[36:33] you ain't read your Bible I had a little
[36:39] bit better understanding of that I'm
[36:41] sorry to slap you with it but I had a
[36:44] little bit better understanding in the
[36:46] Baptist Church than that if you commit
[36:53] adultery
[36:54] there's that one atonement
[37:00] you better be careful with number two
[37:04] now you want to get in the Bible and
[37:06] stay with me for a long time on that
[37:07] we'll talk about it but there's no need
[37:11] of it because there's no need to do it
[37:13] because the Bible it's what it was the
[37:15] law was a record keeper I can show you
[37:19] where brother Brennan said you but not
[37:20] come back for the same thing the next
[37:22] year well there was a lot under that Old
[37:29] Testament we don't deal with you know
[37:32] that our Old Testament added I mean the
[37:34] law was added because the Bible said
[37:36] because of the transgression you realize
[37:38] that law was added to expose our lives
[37:42] to bring us under condemnation come on
[37:50] they thought they got something they
[37:51] didn't get around said he said they got
[37:53] the revelation of Jesus Christ the
[37:55] revelations Jesus Christ ought to be
[37:57] able to bring our sins out you don't
[38:00] have to have a rule book do this out of
[38:02] the other the rest said you don't have
[38:05] to have no no Bible or anything to tell
[38:08] you that shalt not commit adultery he
[38:11] says you don't need that
[38:13] well because it's solved you know it's
[38:18] just wrong that's that's what gets me of
[38:20] all this stuff with the message people
[38:22] then you know if they come up here and
[38:24] they try to Judah and Tamar and this and
[38:26] that and the other you know and take
[38:29] Judah and Tamar which is that brought
[38:31] around called it adultery and he said
[38:33] there's no way a predestinate seed come
[38:35] through adultery now I'm quoting him
[38:36] would they take that and make it to be
[38:38] the channel of God
[38:41] did he use that that's what gets me is
[38:46] why there's so much truth why is people
[38:49] want so much error okay now listen so
[38:55] potentially you had a form of salvation
[39:04] in the Old Testament I'm not trying to
[39:07] lay that background or not lose to the
[39:10] people that wouldn't hear last week to
[39:12] listen and
[39:12] oh well all right see then potentially
[39:18] you have the Acorn which you need to let
[39:25] it grow into a oak tree so they had the
[39:30] salvation back there but he couldn't
[39:36] grow into a full reality because the
[39:40] testator was still alive Hebrew says the
[39:46] way in we read it in Hebrews it would
[39:49] not made right threat you know for it
[39:51] then you remember what we were talking
[39:54] about last Sunday you remember in the
[39:57] Old Testament it was death to go behind
[40:00] the vital right if you wasn't ordained
[40:06] dressed right everything right you could
[40:08] not go behind that veil that's why I've
[40:12] always said if you telling me to go
[40:14] behind the veil not back there either
[40:15] gonna set Moses would you do me a favor
[40:18] would you stay up all night tonight and
[40:21] look me over real good to make sure I
[40:22] can go in tomorrow because I don't want
[40:25] nothing missing because one little thing
[40:28] and they did he was dead see it was
[40:32] death in the Old Testament go behind the
[40:33] veil but now watch it what is it now you
[40:36] realize this death now not to go behind
[40:38] the veil we ain't trying to go over
[40:39] there to a building and find a veil to
[40:41] walk behind its death now not to go into
[40:45] words Jesus Christ as that or your
[40:48] salvation to bring you to a perfect
[40:50] realization a reality into your life
[40:54] right cuz see now listen you remember
[41:00] this one from what we were talking about
[41:04] your prophet had a way of explaining
[41:07] things that's the way I like it go ahead
[41:09] and number three we will pick up and run
[41:11] this a little bit with some quotes
[41:13] though we're a firm believer in the
[41:17] Prophet brought the message off of the
[41:20] unveiling of God preached in
[41:22] Jeffersonville 1964 now watching book
[41:25] before if
[41:26] man walked in behind that veil that was
[41:28] sudden death right Old Testament and
[41:32] we're going to get a lesson here in a
[41:34] minute see if you can you can receive it
[41:36] to walk behind them skins even one of
[41:39] the priests sons tried to do it one time
[41:42] and died don't go behind that veil no
[41:45] man that walked behind why there was no
[41:48] redemption yet in that there was no
[41:55] redemption there was a covering you can
[42:02] call that redemption enough but get what
[42:05] he's saying there's no redemption under
[42:09] the blood of bulls and goats cut if it
[42:13] was why do you need Jesus Christ if
[42:17] there was a redemption that you don't
[42:20] need you said what you said a minute ago
[42:21] they say that's right but it never
[42:24] brought him eternal life it never
[42:30] brought eternal life to the Old
[42:32] Testament people the blood of bulls and
[42:36] goats couldn't do that because there was
[42:38] no life to be able to come out to come
[42:40] upon the believer to bring eternal life
[42:46] yeah but I think sorta well that's your
[42:52] thinking I've got well go ahead because
[42:57] you're just worrying yourself to death
[42:59] you're not getting the point because
[43:01] listen folks I'm doing what I've tried
[43:04] to do for 50 years I've tried for 50
[43:11] years to preach salvation to people to
[43:17] where they could accept it you saying
[43:22] we're all lost I've told you over and
[43:25] over I don't have nowhere I've told you
[43:28] I'd rather go down the road all of my
[43:31] life seeking after God and get it to end
[43:34] of the road and find out I had it all
[43:36] the time
[43:37] then to go down through my life and not
[43:39] seeking after God because of some thing
[43:41] that I do and I shouted I spoke in
[43:43] tongues I cried I done this I've done
[43:45] that I seen visions that are and come
[43:48] down the end of the road and he said
[43:49] depart from them well I'm trying to
[43:53] preach to you salvation it'll get you to
[43:56] realize your lost well brother now you
[44:00] can't you can't tell me I'm lost
[44:03] well why are you getting upset I mean I
[44:07] don't know probably I'm just preaching
[44:11] yeah yeah but I've done this I've done
[44:14] that I believe the prophets message
[44:15] praise God soldiers a devil so now
[44:18] everything you name that you say you
[44:20] could do we're gonna get into it I'm
[44:22] asking you have asked you over and over
[44:23] to do I've asked you to read or listen
[44:25] to the inner Vail are the Intervale or
[44:29] why as God's people so tossed about now
[44:33] there's a description even in their
[44:35] books of that brother Branham preached a
[44:40] message called Intervale
[44:41] they titled it and retitled it Intervale
[44:46] then they retitle it to why are my
[44:50] people so talked about Intervale and
[44:52] Intervale is two different messages you
[44:56] better check it the priest one of them's
[45:00] in Spurgeon's michigan and the other one
[45:03] is in Jeffersonville Indiana see they
[45:05] goofed in trying to figure out what was
[45:07] doing they should have stayed with the
[45:09] old original inner veil but they changed
[45:14] it to Intervale it is corrected which
[45:17] you can't correct it because there's two
[45:19] different messages you want to sit down
[45:22] and with me and look at it I wouldn't
[45:24] tell you something that I hadn't looked
[45:26] at what do you look at us yeah I'm I'm
[45:29] concerned my soul is involved in it but
[45:31] you don't want your soul is involved in
[45:33] this that's why I have to be so specific
[45:37] listen I have to listen to the prophet
[45:40] and look back in that Old Testament
[45:44] there was no redemption yet in that Wow
[45:47] it was potentially
[45:52] well it was under the blood of bulls and
[45:54] goats under the Old Testament it was
[45:57] potentially watch him he was just
[46:01] potential than what anything potential
[46:04] is not the real thing yet
[46:09] the oak tree the Acorn is not the oak
[46:13] tree yet but it's potentially everything
[46:18] that'll ever be in the oak tree is in
[46:21] the Acorn right so come on anything
[46:25] potential is not the real time see
[46:27] yes potentially it was ridden sin was
[46:29] covered now he's explaining what's
[46:32] happening in the Old Testament what
[46:33] happened sin was covered not omitted it
[46:41] couldn't be done away with then he says
[46:43] remitted rather watch him not remitted
[46:47] remitted as divorced or put away and
[46:50] divorced and put away is not even Corral
[46:54] now come on I can quote if you wanted us
[46:57] getting married and divorce if you don't
[46:58] run a little while the coaches the blood
[47:04] of bull you put it try to put it under
[47:06] the blood some way you just about as
[47:07] well put it under the Old Testament
[47:09] blood of bulls and go you better get it
[47:11] ride read what he's saying he's simply
[47:15] saying sin was covered it was not
[47:18] eradicated it was not done away with it
[47:24] was not totally to use the word remitted
[47:27] as divorced and put away because it
[47:31] couldn't be done and so the blood of
[47:34] sheeps and goats could not do that
[47:37] so Jehovah was hid behind the veil now
[47:41] back behind this rail where he was hid
[47:43] to enter into there a man drop dead to
[47:46] try to enter into it potentially
[47:51] potentially the blood of bulls and goes
[47:59] potentially turn away we're seeing of
[48:03] mankind
[48:04] potentially because it could only cover
[48:06] not eradicate it not totally annihilated
[48:12] it couldn't be done in the Old Testament
[48:15] that's what Jesus Christ had to die if I
[48:19] will said he died once for all old and
[48:22] new he had to pay the price for
[48:26] everything so what was it the redemption
[48:31] was not back down and that's why Hebrews
[48:37] 11 it tells you of all of the people of
[48:41] the Old Testament st. and said they
[48:44] without us could not be made perfect may
[48:49] I say that this way they without the
[48:52] blood of Jesus Christ
[48:55] under the blood of bulls and goats they
[48:58] can't be made perfect you ain't but
[49:01] called me and you something okay without
[49:03] us they without us but that's us boy
[49:06] we're we're South mainly what now you're
[49:10] getting off this too bad going the other
[49:11] way they without us they without the
[49:16] salvation that we have within our hearts
[49:20] and our lives cannot be made perfect our
[49:25] complete are finished all right see it
[49:32] can't be done
[49:38] potentially wouldn't totally remit the
[49:46] sin he wouldn't do it he would cover it
[49:55] then Jesus Christ would have to come and
[49:57] give his life to remit it or do away
[50:00] with it or destroy it well brother
[50:05] they'll see that's what we're going to
[50:06] get down to one of these days and and
[50:08] it's gonna jump out on you like a I'm
[50:10] praying to God every day and not in day
[50:12] for one time to appreciate to where
[50:15] everybody in here can come to a place to
[50:17] look at there
[50:17] on sale that sister in that message on
[50:22] the blasphemous names she said because
[50:25] of the way that you are preaching the
[50:28] new birth read the message of asking -
[50:30] he says because she said because of the
[50:33] way your preaching
[50:35] said I'm wondering if I have it the way
[50:42] he was preaching it because he wasn't
[50:47] playing around with those sugar tits on
[50:49] Baptist doctrine well we got everything
[50:51] one who believed and see that's what
[50:54] you're feigning in your mind you said
[50:55] well I believe what do you believe I
[51:02] believe Jesus Christ paid for my sin and
[51:04] died in my place amen now can I say
[51:08] brother Branham can I quote him you have
[51:13] accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior
[51:15] that's wonderful but can I ask you a
[51:18] question
[51:19] has he accepted you is that the quote
[51:24] from the Prophet has he accepted you
[51:29] well yeah he said and I believe it
[51:35] that's good but has he done it now then
[51:42] I'll say the rest of it goes with the
[51:44] story because the Prophet said it this
[51:46] way he said if he's accepted you then
[51:49] you can't turn down one word oh so you
[51:56] can't argue with anything that I've said
[51:58] about the Old Testament Saints and where
[52:00] they're sitting because it's the Word of
[52:02] God well I just don't believe it's good
[52:06] way I don't care what you believe I'm
[52:09] trying my best to get you the place -
[52:11] you don't even know what you believe
[52:12] what see if they're that way by the way
[52:16] you can do something about it you see
[52:20] you're the funniest preacher I've ever
[52:22] heard
[52:22] cuz everybody wants to get us build up
[52:24] and build up yeah build up in what
[52:31] tell most you to realize you're lost can
[52:38] I quote wrote around
[52:39] he said we're too full I can quote to
[52:43] you know he said we're too full he said
[52:46] we need to be have empty vessels well I
[52:54] just I just can't go ok ok ok now watch
[53:00] him as he go don't go to number four
[53:02] which is God's provided place of worship
[53:05] notice also then science of the Old
[53:08] Testament potentially under the
[53:12] sacrifice they were waiting for this new
[53:16] one to come and a good conscience toward
[53:22] God they were potentially it wasn't lost
[53:31] they're saved but no the Old Testament
[53:36] had the new birth and where do we get to
[53:39] that and ask you a simple question what
[53:42] is the new birth I believe on Jesus
[53:47] Christ I'm looking at notes laying on my
[53:53] desk where brother Branham said as long
[53:56] as your confession is right you're saved
[53:59] but he said if your confessions changes
[54:02] you're lost
[54:03] oh brother down you're trying to say we
[54:10] can be saved and lost we can be we can
[54:13] be saved and lost well we can't be born
[54:15] again and lost there's a difference in
[54:18] the statement we're gonna get down to
[54:25] some technical thing where the Prophet
[54:29] said you receive eternal life when you
[54:30] believe
[54:35] you
[54:39] Nene's gonna say you can't believe
[54:41] without the baptism the hold of God sort
[54:50] of said we had a long ways to go to find
[54:52] out what this new birth is why is it
[54:59] I've asked you why is it that it took
[55:05] the disciples 3 and 1/2 years of walking
[55:09] with the Lord Jesus before they could
[55:12] ever come to a born-again experience but
[55:22] yet once that Holy Ghost failed in the
[55:27] upper room outside of a matter of a few
[55:30] hours later the Holy Ghost fell on three
[55:33] thousand then you run over to kinesin
[55:41] house and just by hearing the word the
[55:45] Holy Ghost falls on them and don't
[55:47] forget now we got scripture says if they
[55:52] receive the Holy Ghost like we have like
[55:55] we did oh they just got this they just
[55:58] got that you you got a lot to go through
[56:03] let's go number five Jesus Christ the
[56:07] same yesterday today and forever and
[56:09] think about what he's saying now the
[56:17] prophets could not be sanctified now
[56:21] watch him the toe just using that the
[56:23] other day read it on down and you'll get
[56:26] what he's saying he's simply saying the
[56:29] prophets could not be sanctified
[56:31] they were just potentially sanctified he
[56:34] goes on to explain it and watch him the
[56:41] prophets could not be sanctified
[56:43] potentially they were potentially they
[56:47] were not sanctified as a form of a New
[56:51] Testament form of speak
[56:53] Oh sanctification oh they never had to
[56:55] but they were potentially by the
[57:00] offering of a bull or an ox or something
[57:02] or sheep or heifer they were potentially
[57:05] under that blood as the brother most
[57:07] gallantly has presented that they could
[57:10] be sanctified potentially under looking
[57:17] forward to the atonement being made
[57:18] perfect for under the blood of bulls and
[57:21] goats when the bull died are the heifer
[57:24] died or the sheep died the life in that
[57:27] blood could not come back on the Prophet
[57:29] because it was an animal's life and an
[57:32] animal's life would bring you profit to
[57:37] an animal they are you listening to what
[57:41] he's plainly saying you can't bring the
[57:44] blood of Jesus I mean the blood of an
[57:46] animal to anybody and make them perfect
[57:52] with it right it doesn't matter if
[57:57] they're prophet or who they are they
[57:59] can't be brought to that place to worry
[58:03] that it would work okay go ahead the
[58:09] number six
[58:16] he swore by himself man dropped plumb
[58:18] down to hear the blood of sheep and goat
[58:21] held him this far as potentially until
[58:27] the fullness of time came then God came
[58:30] down himself not an angel not a chair of
[58:34] being but God came from heaven and went
[58:36] all the way to hell to bring man up from
[58:39] Hell to heaven with him he come hunting
[58:41] the lost sheep
[58:46] waiting until Jesus Christ came the
[58:52] reason I gave you this about the
[58:54] prophets is called see I know the
[58:56] statements I've been around 50 something
[58:59] years and listened to people and their
[59:02] work talks about Elijah and it says as
[59:05] thy soul liveth the people saved either
[59:09] he had eternal life now how could he
[59:16] have eternal life what he's under a
[59:17] potential they wait I mean we got you
[59:21] trapped brother Dale don't jump too
[59:24] quick those you covered that you covered
[59:28] Adam in a certain way sure did not still
[59:32] believe it so don't just jump up and run
[59:35] off with it now just listen potentially
[59:40] until the fullness came and what was the
[59:42] foolish when God came himself okay now
[59:47] look what he says on the message souls
[59:50] that are in prison now he talked about
[59:56] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[59:58] mysteries and in the seven mystery of
[1:00:01] Hell the entire mystery of it and it was
[1:00:03] the book of redemption new Testament
[1:00:11] well now read it now we just read back
[1:00:18] over there we're under the potential
[1:00:20] there was no redemption it was just
[1:00:23] covering it pushing it forward to a
[1:00:25] redemption through Jesus Christ now
[1:00:28] what's he saying
[1:00:31] don't let to see you steal the seven
[1:00:33] mystery look and it was the book of
[1:00:38] redemption now watch him New Testament
[1:00:44] not the old it only proclaimed for the
[1:00:52] New Testament the Old Testament only
[1:00:54] proclaimed are pushed forward are paid
[1:00:57] what they have been made cannot be made
[1:01:01] perfect without us Hebrews 11 see now
[1:01:04] the redemption only come when the
[1:01:06] Redeemer died that's your word you know
[1:01:14] that the New Testament with the death of
[1:01:17] the testator Hebrews Redemption only
[1:01:21] come when the Redeemer died and they
[1:01:24] were potentially under the blood of the
[1:01:26] lambs not the Redeemer hadn't been
[1:01:29] redeemed yet until the Redeemer came so
[1:01:37] when you're dealing with Redemption
[1:01:38] remember your Old Testament is not
[1:01:40] dealing Redemption it only spoke of way
[1:01:45] to hit that we just wait along the line
[1:01:47] we don't talk about what we're gonna
[1:01:49] breathe wide worried about it I don't
[1:01:55] say to him you need to preach this and
[1:01:57] I'll preach on this they don't know we
[1:01:59] don't do it I don't do it within these
[1:02:00] other brothers either I don't try it in
[1:02:02] any way to do to the influence them one
[1:02:06] way or the other
[1:02:07] I want them to preach what God gives
[1:02:09] them in their heart I've always told
[1:02:16] them don't worry about it anything comes
[1:02:18] up we'll work it out they don't fit
[1:02:21] right we'll get together sit down talk
[1:02:23] about we'll work it out we'll see what's
[1:02:25] right and we'll take what's right code I
[1:02:30] don't have all the answers
[1:02:38] let's see that was sold in prison let's
[1:02:41] get this one will at least get a little
[1:02:43] bit look what he says on the number
[1:02:45] eight which is the maniac will get a
[1:02:48] really pronounced hitting 1954 now the
[1:02:54] background behind this to try to tell
[1:02:56] you and brother branham said in other
[1:02:58] words the guys making fun jibber jabber
[1:03:00] since I run said it's pure blasphemy the
[1:03:02] guy was saying his point was he was
[1:03:06] proving that you didn't and it the
[1:03:09] points right listen he was proving that
[1:03:12] people did not speak in tongues he's
[1:03:19] saying John didn't speak in John he said
[1:03:21] all these others didn't speak in tongue
[1:03:25] his points right but he's jibber
[1:03:31] jabbering Brett run says in other words
[1:03:33] he's making fun of the tongues and the
[1:03:34] thingy and got it right choice
[1:03:36] blaspheming don't make light of the word
[1:03:40] of God it don't matter if you don't
[1:03:41] understand it leave it alone and I've
[1:03:44] seen them many of many things and I
[1:03:46] wanted to get up and this screaming
[1:03:49] holler about it but something says leave
[1:03:51] it alone you leave it alone if you don't
[1:03:57] make fun of the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:03:58] matter what but look what he says the
[1:04:05] guy the man now the man is one Satan
[1:04:08] John the Baptist received the Holy Ghost
[1:04:10] and didn't speak in tongues now that's
[1:04:12] what the man is saying are you following
[1:04:15] me the man is saying there a lot of
[1:04:19] these receive the Holy Ghost and so
[1:04:21] forth like that and never said anything
[1:04:23] about tongues Zacharias and them now
[1:04:29] let's follow him
[1:04:30] but listen real close I said that was
[1:04:38] before the Holy Ghost was ever given the
[1:04:44] man was arguing about the this and not
[1:04:47] speeding it and he said that was before
[1:04:50] the Holy Ghost would ever give him he
[1:04:54] said well they say they had any pauses
[1:04:58] because he's stating what the man is
[1:05:01] saying so evidently the man must have
[1:05:03] been saying well they say they had the
[1:05:05] Holy Ghost or something cause he stops
[1:05:06] in palsy now take what the Prophet says
[1:05:10] and I said now they did not say they had
[1:05:15] the baptism of the holy God do you know
[1:05:24] what the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:32] he's actually saying now come on I'll
[1:05:35] give you this one I'll give you all the
[1:05:36] quotes you won't code I'm gonna worry
[1:05:37] about it
[1:05:38] I'll give you her brother Brown said
[1:05:39] John received the baptism of the holy
[1:05:41] ghost while he's in his mother's womb
[1:05:42] with any sin hear that John didn't do it
[1:05:47] he's not contrary he's explaining things
[1:05:49] in different places different ways if
[1:05:52] not you tell me you think I'm trying to
[1:05:56] interpret it or figure it out you come
[1:05:58] and tell me what it is I'll come back to
[1:06:00] the church and I'll say brother
[1:06:01] so-and-so said sister so-and-so said and
[1:06:03] it's what straightened me out now no
[1:06:05] problems with it but I want you to bring
[1:06:08] the whole Bible the whole Word of God we
[1:06:11] don't talk about silly jibber-jabber
[1:06:13] that's what that guy was doing listen
[1:06:17] and I said now they did not say they had
[1:06:21] the baptism of the holy God he's 1000%
[1:06:27] correct
[1:06:34] now come on we'll to be far enough into
[1:06:36] the message to know at least one thing
[1:06:37] just you can have the baptism of the
[1:06:39] Holy Ghost
[1:06:40] own your spirit every day of your life
[1:06:42] and die and go to hell so we ought to
[1:06:44] know that's true right but let's drop on
[1:06:48] down a little bit further to see what
[1:06:50] he's talking about he's saying John
[1:06:54] never received the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:57] Spirit oh yes he did okay you got the
[1:07:04] quotes I got him I'll bring him tell you
[1:07:07] so he must be explaining something if he
[1:07:10] says something in one place and
[1:07:11] something over here and it seemed a
[1:07:12] little different they must be something
[1:07:14] there he's trying to explain that's not
[1:07:18] me trying to figure it out I just lay
[1:07:20] down both things he said I can
[1:07:26] conclusively prove that you were born
[1:07:28] again and then baptized into the body
[1:07:33] now is that statement contrary it's
[1:07:37] contrary to my thinking in yours because
[1:07:39] it don't make sense
[1:07:42] he explains what he's one is come on
[1:07:47] listen now get his point what Adam had
[1:07:54] the Holy Ghost potentially I see you've
[1:07:57] argued with me over the time that I
[1:07:59] preached from blasphemous names trying
[1:08:01] to show where brother branham said over
[1:08:03] and over that that Adam received eternal
[1:08:07] life breathed into his nostrils the
[1:08:09] breath of eternal life and he became an
[1:08:11] eternal person with God you've argued
[1:08:14] that in your mind now argue this quote
[1:08:16] Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially so
[1:08:25] evidently Adam didn't have everything
[1:08:26] that's what I tried my best to explain
[1:08:28] to me I tried my best to explain to you
[1:08:32] over and over and over that Adam
[1:08:34] received eternal life in his soul that's
[1:08:37] what your prophet said but that still
[1:08:40] left him to where he went out and he
[1:08:43] done wrong
[1:08:44] I did if I had listened some time
[1:08:51] instead of trying to argue to refute
[1:08:53] something Adam had the Holy Ghost
[1:08:57] potentially that's right all the
[1:08:59] prophets as they were moved by the Holy
[1:09:01] Ghost to watch him moved by the Holy
[1:09:04] Ghost
[1:09:05] but the Saint John said that that the
[1:09:08] Holy Ghost had not yet come but he's
[1:09:14] just saying in the same paragraph same
[1:09:15] sentence that the prophets were moved by
[1:09:18] the Holy Ghost then he turns around said
[1:09:25] that the Holy Ghost is not yet come
[1:09:26] because Jesus had not been glorified so
[1:09:32] there must be something about this Holy
[1:09:33] Ghost am i quoting lawful stature of a
[1:09:37] perfect man am i quoting from
[1:09:40] blasphemous names and did we say we
[1:09:44] understand the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:46] do we he didn't say that they had the
[1:09:54] baptism on the Holy Ghost
[1:10:01] John never had the baptism the old ago
[1:10:03] he's all I got
[1:10:18] Luke one in 15 or he'll be great in the
[1:10:23] sight of the Lord and she'll drink
[1:10:25] neither wine nor strong drink and he
[1:10:27] shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even
[1:10:30] from his mother's womb well that's and
[1:10:41] that's contrary to what was being said a
[1:10:44] moment ago
[1:10:45] well how about another one we deal with
[1:10:50] John we deal with Adam we deal with
[1:10:52] people like that
[1:10:53] what about this scripture can you get
[1:10:56] number 12 brothers I'm asking you to
[1:10:59] jump over Feist we'll come back to these
[1:11:03] next week Luke 141 well I keep that one
[1:11:08] up here because it says in Luke 115 and
[1:11:14] he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:15] even from his mother's womb what did his
[1:11:22] mother get what did John's mother get
[1:11:33] and it came to pice Luke 141 that when
[1:11:39] Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary
[1:11:41] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:11:44] Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:00] what is the vamp tears when the whole
[1:12:02] ago well you shall confuse me brother de
[1:12:05] you you've made I'm hope to god I can't
[1:12:08] confuse you because if I can confuse you
[1:12:11] you don't have what you think you got is
[1:12:14] that plain enough yeah but you're
[1:12:17] hateful hateful of what I spent my whole
[1:12:26] life to try to save your soul my whole
[1:12:35] life has been trying to save your soul
[1:12:37] and it's talking about everybody or
[1:12:40] anybody after listening it counts it we
[1:12:45] say John the Baptist had the baptism and
[1:12:47] Holy Ghost one in mother's womb amen
[1:12:50] John had the Holy Ghost Monroe's Ruth
[1:12:53] amen Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
[1:12:58] Ghost do we understand what it means to
[1:13:06] be a baptism when the whole ago
[1:13:11] how could Elizabeth have be filled with
[1:13:14] all ago when Jesus hadn't died yet he
[1:13:18] was still learning to Mama's wound this
[1:13:20] right Mary's wounds when he was talking
[1:13:23] to Elizabeth Elizabeth John's about six
[1:13:26] months and ain't moved
[1:13:36] you get over the book of Acts you can
[1:13:38] really get into some wonderful time
[1:13:39] because a lot of times when they met in
[1:13:41] the book of Acts the Bible says the Holy
[1:13:43] Ghost came down and filled him holler or
[1:13:45] this enter the other about him you know
[1:13:47] they had I say for the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:50] given this is for the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:52] given what is the baptism of those oh
[1:14:03] okay we're wet who's on number uh was on
[1:14:09] number seven number I excuse me huh
[1:14:15] bypass number eight because number eight
[1:14:18] is simply telling you that you can have
[1:14:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't
[1:14:22] mean you're going in what he said cuz
[1:14:28] you have it on your spirit please go to
[1:14:29] death remember in that spirit you can be
[1:14:33] baptized with a genuine spirit of God
[1:14:35] and still be lost but we understand all
[1:14:39] about the baptism that's number nine
[1:14:42] excuse me but they were on I give 10 but
[1:14:47] they see baptism the whole girls don't
[1:14:50] mean you're going in at all not only
[1:14:53] don't have anything to do with your soul
[1:14:56] okay that's a baptism don't have
[1:15:01] anything do you so that's the baptism
[1:15:03] here's the inside soul the new birth is
[1:15:10] not a baptism on your spirit it better
[1:15:17] be a baptism in your soul well praise
[1:15:32] God
[1:15:36] you confused enough well bless God I'll
[1:15:39] just leave well let me say this to you
[1:15:43] goodbye
[1:15:44] which you'll leave confused but there's
[1:15:46] one thing about it then nobody ever left
[1:15:48] this church that I wanted them to leave
[1:15:50] now you can talk all you want to about
[1:15:54] this that or the other I have never
[1:15:56] tried to run anybody off in this church
[1:15:58] I've tried to save everybody it was here
[1:16:01] now if I did run them off whose problem
[1:16:10] with me okay let's go one more then
[1:16:14] we'll quit again go to number 13 you
[1:16:18] have to flop away over cord we passed a
[1:16:19] couple go to number 13 this is from
[1:16:23] questions and answers 1964
[1:16:27] now listen Jesus told Peter who had been
[1:16:33] both saved and sanctified and he
[1:16:37] believed on Jesus was sanctified Saint
[1:16:41] John 17:17 jesus said sanctify them
[1:16:44] father through thy truth thy Word is
[1:16:46] truth and he and the word is the same
[1:16:49] they were sanctified potentially through
[1:16:56] the truth now it took me two weeks to
[1:17:00] get to this quote okay hang on a minute
[1:17:01] let me speak on this quote amendment
[1:17:03] listen
[1:17:04] they were sanctified potentially through
[1:17:07] the truth the word the truth and Jhin
[1:17:12] Jesus told Judas are now changes it to
[1:17:15] Peter Peter the night of the betrayal he
[1:17:20] said after you're converted strengthen
[1:17:25] your brethren after you you're converted
[1:17:30] the man had followed him for three years
[1:17:34] this is Peter right had named on the
[1:17:38] lounge book of life and cast out Devils
[1:17:41] and done great works and healed and done
[1:17:43] all kind of preach the word everything
[1:17:46] and still wasn't converted
[1:17:51] the your leading to conversion but now
[1:17:59] as I said three or four weeks ago
[1:18:02] started on this trying to get to that
[1:18:04] one little statement I hope you followed
[1:18:08] me to the point back up a minute the Old
[1:18:12] Testament was under the blood of bulls
[1:18:14] and goats that life of that animal could
[1:18:18] not come back in to the human being to
[1:18:21] bring a new birth so it was potentially
[1:18:27] that he says those prophets were
[1:18:31] sanctified I'm holding at him on to that
[1:18:41] point because I want you to think about
[1:18:44] Adam Adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:18:48] your prophet said it I didn't and he
[1:18:54] said he was an eternal person with God
[1:18:57] but then he said Adam had the Holy Ghost
[1:18:59] potentially evidently Adam didn't have
[1:19:04] anything right when he had he turn alive
[1:19:08] see that's where you're not listening to
[1:19:11] what was preached God started his church
[1:19:16] in the garden with a man and a woman
[1:19:21] with eternal life in their soul but not
[1:19:26] in their body and spirit and that gave
[1:19:29] the way that Satan could enter in to
[1:19:33] Adam and Eve you say Adam well Adam was
[1:19:36] not deceived he knew better
[1:19:37] so he's in worse shape as he is until it
[1:19:41] was perverted even with him with eternal
[1:19:44] life in his soul
[1:19:53] I'm not gonna argue with you because I'm
[1:19:55] gonna try to hold it and believe it John
[1:19:59] the Baptist then we'll ask you a
[1:20:04] question a second so hold on John the
[1:20:07] Baptist could have received eternal life
[1:20:11] into his soul
[1:20:14] but mama Elizabeth got an anointing you
[1:20:20] say yeah yeah
[1:20:24] because remember Adam only had the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost potentially so Adam didn't have it
[1:20:31] right the way it's supposed to be now
[1:20:34] we're gonna say it because what is the
[1:20:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost may I quote
[1:20:43] brother branham justification
[1:20:47] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:50] Ghost completes the birth right
[1:20:57] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:20:58] Spirit it is not the baptism
[1:21:01] sanctification is a work of the Holy
[1:21:03] Spirit it is not the baptism the baptism
[1:21:07] is the new birth so Adam never went
[1:21:12] through justification Adam never went
[1:21:16] through sanctification Adam never went
[1:21:18] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:21:20] get it it was imparted unto him he wants
[1:21:26] to all evening what about a foolish
[1:21:29] virgin that one day will be given
[1:21:32] eternal life do you believe that do you
[1:21:35] believe was a foolish virgin when they
[1:21:36] can be given II it has to be an
[1:21:39] impartation because he don't go through
[1:21:40] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:21:43] of the whole now the disciples went
[1:21:47] through justification sanctification
[1:21:51] it was potential because the blood of
[1:21:53] Jesus Christ had not been shared
[1:21:55] but as quick as the shed blood came they
[1:21:59] went straight to the upper room and
[1:22:01] received the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:03] outside
[1:22:05] 3000 went through justification
[1:22:09] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:22:12] holy ghost and received eternal life
[1:22:17] into their soul started to church in the
[1:22:27] garden with a man with eternal life in
[1:22:30] his soul started to church on the day of
[1:22:34] Pentecost with a hundred and twenty in
[1:22:38] the upper room with the Holy Ghost into
[1:22:41] their soul developed over in just a few
[1:22:44] minutes flowed outside in 3000 received
[1:22:48] it
[1:22:54] what is the baptism when the whole to go
[1:22:57] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:23:00] of the Holy Ghost you can't go you can
[1:23:06] be justified without being sanctified
[1:23:07] you can be sanctified without getting
[1:23:09] the baptism ago and my quoting brother
[1:23:11] Branham but if you come through
[1:23:14] justification of sanctification the
[1:23:16] baptism when the Holy Ghost
[1:23:17] you got the new birth but if you don't
[1:23:21] and you just say I believe it and I got
[1:23:23] it when I believe you don't have it
[1:23:27] that's what I've proved over and over
[1:23:29] and over because those Old Testament
[1:23:32] Saints went through potentially
[1:23:35] justifications potentially
[1:23:38] sanctification the prophets went through
[1:23:41] he's ready potentially the disciples
[1:23:45] went through it potentially because the
[1:23:49] Holy Ghost had not been given so nobody
[1:23:52] could get the new birth
[1:23:53] so Adam never got the new birth he got
[1:23:56] eternal life no hole to go John never
[1:24:00] got the new birth
[1:24:03] he won't scripture the least in the
[1:24:07] kingdom and greater than John that's
[1:24:13] Scripture
[1:24:15] but John the Baptist had the Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] from his mother's womb you said you're
[1:24:22] gonna call yeah I'd say he had eternal
[1:24:24] life in his soul from his mother's womb
[1:24:26] so did Adam what are you thinking what
[1:24:38] is the baptism in long ago I shouted I
[1:24:42] cried as brother Brendan said
[1:24:44] there's nine hundred different ways am i
[1:24:47] quoting him
[1:24:48] remember that nine hundred different
[1:24:51] churches that have different ways of
[1:24:54] saying you must be born again whatever
[1:24:58] one of them has got something related to
[1:25:02] what you do or don't do
[1:25:04] I shouted that cried I spoke in tongues
[1:25:07] that is not the baptism with all of
[1:25:09] those that's the outward effect of the
[1:25:15] Holy Ghost amen he said many shouted and
[1:25:20] didn't get it but he said many shout and
[1:25:22] did get it we don't quote that we quote
[1:25:24] the many shouted and didn't get it
[1:25:26] we don't hope that some shouted and did
[1:25:28] get it what do you think about it you
[1:25:38] want to talk with me buddy come on let's
[1:25:40] talk let's talk about Adam when your
[1:25:43] prophet city had eternal life let's talk
[1:25:48] about John the Baptist when your prophet
[1:25:51] and the Bible said did he had the
[1:25:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost but the only
[1:26:00] thing I've asked you to do is show me
[1:26:02] where Adam went through justification
[1:26:03] sanctification to get the baptism he
[1:26:05] didn't do it
[1:26:07] the disciples couldn't go they could
[1:26:09] only go to justification and
[1:26:10] sanctification and listen that was
[1:26:13] potential because Jesus hadn't died yet
[1:26:17] so that put them right exactly where
[1:26:19] everybody else for that
[1:26:23] could we be justified and sanctified
[1:26:27] could we be in potentials come on these
[1:26:30] issues
[1:26:31] could we be having to say the Holy Ghost
[1:26:33] just potentially well how I know brother
[1:26:42] Dale because the only evidence that the
[1:26:48] prophet would put it on with what if the
[1:26:50] spirit in you agreed with the word well
[1:26:58] it's a great I agreed with everything
[1:27:02] I've ever heard the Prophet say why is
[1:27:07] there so much confusion among the
[1:27:10] believers of this message over a simple
[1:27:20] matter that brother Allen said the first
[1:27:23] message Jesus preached was you must be
[1:27:27] born again if we can't get that right
[1:27:32] there's no need to worry about the seals
[1:27:34] the plagues the vials the thunders this
[1:27:37] time if you can't get the new birth
[1:27:39] right I asked you a simple question the
[1:27:46] other day I said can you tell me a
[1:27:49] definite time in your life that you know
[1:27:54] you met God in a new birth well brother
[1:28:02] Dale I was down at the altar and I begin
[1:28:04] to shout speaking to I don't want to
[1:28:07] talk about that I want an experience I
[1:28:10] don't want a sensation or a stimulation
[1:28:14] upon the flesh the friend says you can
[1:28:17] have the baptism in the Holy go without
[1:28:19] a sensation
[1:28:32] what are you putting your salvation on
[1:28:36] 90% of you right now would say because I
[1:28:40] believe the message
[1:28:52] the devil beater star you see why
[1:28:58] brother branham if you can't I don't
[1:29:01] mean I'm right and this is writing
[1:29:03] that's go but I'm just saying I've tried
[1:29:05] for months to explain one little thing
[1:29:07] what is the new birth well yet everybody
[1:29:13] understands all that brought around him
[1:29:14] understands about it but he said that
[1:29:18] sister on blasphemies my answers
[1:29:20] he said she was concerned about the way
[1:29:25] he was preaching and she wondered if she
[1:29:33] had to baptism one home to go the
[1:29:41] preaching of the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:42] Ghost will split this people to message
[1:29:44] wide open it split it wide open
[1:29:52] new birth you don't have to get mad and
[1:29:55] divorce and seals and flags and the
