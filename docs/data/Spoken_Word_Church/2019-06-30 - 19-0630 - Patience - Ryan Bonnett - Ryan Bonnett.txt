========================================

understanding he didn't understand in the spiritual maybe but you have to study and pray and seek God okay that that's part of the Christian journey and Lowell is all grown over with thorns cares of life look hey Jesus talked about that and locate and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and our choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring forth no fruit to perfection okay and lo it was all going over with thorns okay and medals if you look up medals the best definition I could find that that is useless prickly roots and we're all rooted in something spiritually speaking we're like trees and whatever we're rooted in is going to determine what fruit we produce you know and then we bear fruit or not and if we're rooted in Christ won't bear the fruits of the spirit but if we're rooted in other things will bear bitterness and strife and hatred and all kind of malice all kind of things of the world so the middle is a useless prickly root and I've got a scripture on that Hebrews 12 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fell from the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest of being fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright he saw was a very carnal man very natural carnal and not you know what would say life spiritually minded in us all [Music] Hebrews 12:12 14 then I saw him considered it well this is Solomon now he's looking at the field of this man and the man laying there slothful and I saw him in Sarah well looked upon it tall I mean I miss the top sorry go back okay so medals it had thorns had nails and other things he said was that the stone wall was broken down he lacked revelation you know because revelation is representing Scripture biased or no rocks and if we build our house upon Jesus said rock of salvation you know you're here and a doer of the word and Jesus a locking you into a raw Amanda Bill's house upon a rock the floods come the winds blow and the houses stand but if you're built upon sand and the bunks let's come the floods of life the tribulations and trials come and they'll you know your house will fall or the wind will come and wind of doctrine and you'll be gone you'd be fallen false doctrine or whatever and blown away with every idea so his stone wall was broken down ok you like revelation then I saw him for Sarah well looked upon it and received instruction a little sleep a little slumber a little go ahead and see sleep those without power to come I want to travel it you know if you're traveling here and there you're eventually going to be broke y'all really staying anywhere and a job making a living and that kind of thing you're just traveling from place to place so your lady will run out of money and same thing the harmed man best I could come up with of what that's talking about is like somebody who's fortified the side behind something man-made instead of behind the work of God an armed man you know ready for battle but not behind the shield of faith and behind all the armor of God okay God's covenant with Abraham annecy now if we don't just get what we asked for spontaneously well then there's nothing to it we walked back best shows were not seed of Abraham Abraham waited 25 years and was stronger at the end of the 25 years believing he was going to receive than he did the day God told him about it but we can't wait for one day to another oh well God you proved to me oh my what a weakling we are you say well promised Abraham he promised you - you're the seed of Abraham if you're in Christ you're the seed of Abraham every promise was to Abraham is under you and then if it not because you did this because you do in church because of God because but because God by foreknowledge elected you and called you to Jesus new except today in bowing of God that work must grow in order to grow it's got to be in the right kind of brown God Mensae promise and it hits that heart cannot fail Noah waited 120 years they've run waited 25 years on the child of God said so and that settled it what is it the work was there being watered by faith believing it brought forth the results it brought forth the Son and brought forth the rain and brought forth the flood brought forth the virgin that was conceived [Applause] there's only one way provided by God for anything blood hasn't taken effect hasn't taken effect and you see it in your life as a consecrated toilet go with what jesus said would take place and be careful you might have something else besides the look you might have a little injection of theology in there or something a little injective sensation you say well I quivered I shook I danced I did this be careful the medicine every structure is good for every human being misled from sin they'll clean up from a life of sin to make a different person of you it'll take the belt away to make you a new creation in Christ for the area does the guitar you know they break the song I am resolved no longer to linger tombow rose to life things that are higher

gonna try to put the scripture up here I'm not really that tech savvy but I found a little fellow Bible app that I can use and you'll see that in the back pretty good that's that's okay because I can't make it any bigger I'll try out how to make it bigger but I'm going to read Psalm 25 if y'all want to open your Bibles and follow along I'm just gonna read it it's not a response and really I'll just read it it kind of goes along with my lesson a song of David unto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul oh my god I trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me yay let none that weight on me be ashamed let them be ashamed which transgress without cause shew me thy ways o Lord teach me thy paths leave me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the God of my salvation on being awake all the day and that's pertain to my lesson all these parts are about talking about waiting on the Lord remember O Lord thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindness for they have been ever a vote remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember thou me without goodness sake o Lord oops go get it man we all right is that it yeah good and upright is the Lord therefore will he teach sinners in the way the meat will he God in judgment and the meat will he teach his way all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto socialists keep his covenant and his testimonies for thy name sake o Lord pardon my iniquity British great what is man that thou that feareth than he what is he that feareth the Lord him shall they teach him the way that he shall choose his soul to dwell ities and his seed showing her at the earth the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant mine eyes ever toward the Lord for he shall pluck must be out of the net turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for I am desolate and afflicted the troubles of my heart are enlarged old bring thou me out of my de-stresses look upon my affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins consider my enemies for their many and they hate me with cruel hatred I'll keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for I've put trust in thee but integrity and upright has preserved me for I wait on me redeem Israel O God out of all his products [Music] redeem Israel so today I'm going to talk about patience and specifically about waiting on the Lord having patience waiting or not and my objectives are basically two things to recognize the importance of waiting on God and to understand that he is always faithful if we wait on him and other words I'm saying he'll bring his word the past we don't worry about his part our part is to wait on him so I'm gonna hang out here for a little while because these words a lot of words in this definition are very meaningful to me so I'm going to talk about these things for a little while this is Strong's that the mission of patience steadfastness constancy just like the inconstant endurance and the New Testament the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety his he even by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfastly a patient steadfast waiting for a patient enduring sustaining and we've been talking about that perseverance that's a good one okay so so basically I'm going to talk mostly I guess I'll start off with delivery so deliberate means like being intentional and they renze go unless you're familiar Dave Ramsey talks about if you if you fail to plan your plan will fail so if you don't have a plan in life you don't have a goal and objective that you're striving for you won't make it they have a plan you're just kind of floating you're floating alone you're a double-minded I think the scripture cross that you can't make up your mind your purpose for settling this for a while then you can get off of that and go on another way I think another word for that but I've talked about a while back is fickle you know you're just kind of you can't make up your mind and constantly changing your purpose you like people I work with I told y'all about two lessons ago that are always changing spouses and houses and cars their dog and everything based then someone in a couple years and they're ready for something there but that's not the way to make it anywhere with God you have to send yourself on the Lord set your mind on God and just stay focused you keep driving straight keep going forward and never stop never stop seeking God and that's being deliberate that's being intentional that's being resolved brother Aaron students that song I've got it here in the end of the lesson if we get to it I am resolved or longer to wait room and a longer to linger I think is that something like that I'm resolved I like to have a resolve in life and there's been several times in my experience of life where I've had a resolve whether it being something natural or something spiritual that I was doing one thing and then I completely change directions and never went back whether it be that one thing was something that I was doing wrong but whatever be if you come to resolve you're completely set you're on a new path and you're not going back period so we have to be resolved to serve the Lord when I gave him a hard floor at 12 years old I wasn't resolved to go through with God and never backs down and never wanted to turn around everyone I was resolved I didn't know about the message I just remember tenants I just knew what the Baptist call didn't say but I wasn't going back I wasn't I wasn't playing around I was very sincere with God so you're not swerved from your deliberate purpose another thing I had an experience in my life I gave my heart forward on 12 but when I was 14 I started wanting to know more about God so I started reading the Bible a little bit I just sort of dabbled in it but not every single day and when I was 15 I realized because I can't reverse all I realized that if you don't make time to read the Bible every day it won't happen okay so at age 15 I was resolved and that's been 19 years ago I've never gone a day without my bubbeh reading because I was resolved at 15 I would never turn back and so that's the resolve it's a change of purpose changing your goal and you're set firming you're not going back and then there's been other things in my lifelong intention but in the message person event brother Ben talks about in the natural realm there's people anyone who has ever accomplished anything had to have perseverance you know they had to be they had to persevere that to be resolved and to be deliberate and intentional entrepreneurs that basically built this country made them made it what it is all of them had that one thing in common that our perseverance like Henry Ford all the other different names I haven't looked into it lately but all the different big names they basically built the country and made a life it is all the big businesses all of them had that one thing in common they all went for a while and fell off to one side or another but they were so resolved and so deliberate and intentional that they got up and they kept going I think Henry Ford if I recall that was I think I heard that was already a car bill he didn't build the first car that was already the car and he had to go to see the people who made that car because they have the patent to get permission I think that needs a built in order to build a parking over there I think he had he had to go get permission from them and they deferred him they said no they they turned him down on this and no you can't do it somehow he kept going and going and pushing and pressing until he finally got through and what he did different than a month they did was he built a car that everybody could afford because before that not everybody could afford a car distraction and you know well off to the fourth car well then he made a car that everybody could afford but he wouldn't stop until he achieved his goal and that's what we're gonna talk about everybody going to use anything in life has to be persevering and you have to have a lot of patience today first event patience and perseverance go hand in hand really can't have one without the other you have to be patient to be perseverant you have to be persevere be patient so why do we need patients and what do we have to wait for well I just listed a few things that are most important that we could talk about salvation we need patience to wait on God for our salvation I need patience to wait on God for our healing for a revelation for other promises of God everything of God all the great things in life that we can attain to we have to have patience and wait on those things because it doesn't come instantaneously I was diagnosed in 2012 13 things 2013 with the basically ulcers in my colon ulcerative colitis and I lost blood every day for altogether five years but you know all that time I think I went to go after one time for prayer and after that I just confessed my healing and I kept saying I'm healed well every time the symptoms showed up I didn't feel very healed but I kept saying those taking back down I'm healed and I kept confessing I thought a brother branham with that stomach element that he had that every time you hate something he'd come back up and that's pretty much taking you to death if you can't keep your food down you're not far from dying good you can't take in nutrients so he kept on confessing his healing and somebody ministry say how you doing my man saying good well prayers Lord and he'd be trying to swallow back down the further kept trying to come back up and find that he was healed he received his the manifestation of his name but he kept confessing his healing and that took patience and me waiting five years for my healing to be manifest and I'm played well today about the way I'm gonna mention that as of 2018 I had no more symptoms only two three ever since I'm not a single other problem and it was hard because here's this the devil hanging over my head by the way this is hereditary he kept telling me you know your grandfather died not of it but he thought with it how I hear of him and I agonizing pain in the bathroom they're screaming because of the cramps and the clothes had caused him and my sister to diagnosed with Crohn's I think that's something similar I don't know exactly what is some kind of sort of man when she was 12 and she's 36 now and still struggling the problems she's had for money here so the devil kept hanging that over my head I say you know what Satan I'll care for my family right so I mean nothing God can't do someone going from the devil things that over your head this if you got an element just say you know what I'm here it's not my safe you just stand right there if symptoms or no symptoms it's just like temptation when you're dealing with salvation this picture saved they're still gonna have temptations you just keep confessing you're saved and don't stop all those things though require patience waiting is very contrary to human nature we want us to gain things in life quickly without difficulty that's just in the natural life unfortunately the same is true for Christmas we want to profess to be mature Christians but not with but without any growing pains trial or sufferings so basically we want to say we're up here and the headstone just because we came in the message well I saw that to make the confession but you know but don't stop seeking God all the way and just keep pressing through and seeking God consider the characters in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress I guess mostly already filming progress you have an hour highly recommended read it slow and preferable and capitalists that's very scriptural very very based in the Bible and it has to do with our natural journey or spiritual journey as a Christian there's a lot of all the characters that's introduced how the name pretended to what they represent and basically just just have to read the book it's all I can say by many characters in the book they bypass the wicked gates was the entrance into this salvation during the program was on that Christian was on and they came in their own way to salvation only to fall away later on so the point is we have to persevere we have to come the right way God's proper provided way and and and have patience and wait on God James 1 verse 2 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have for perfect and I put in their complete work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so you're mature efficiently they're not lacking anything that's what wanting nothing's you're not lacking anything to perfection to completion as a Christian I want to pull that up James gone that's a really good one to read James sermon of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the twelve trials which are scattered abroad greeting my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the triangular face worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that she may be perfect in attire one to nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and a rightist not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering that's what I'm talking about persevere going wavered from open side beside this people stay straight first keep moving on and keep believing for he that waver at this life away to the sea driven with the wind and tossed her let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double minded man is unstable in all his ways now look I think I looked at up the other day that's something to do is like you know you're not set on any certain purpose you know you're just thinking one way for a while then you start going another way you're a double minded let the brothers low degree rejoicing that he is insulted but the rich and that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away where the Sun is no sooner risen with burning Heat by the withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of the parachute so also so the rich man fade away in his ways blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when his tribe he shall receive the crown of life which the LORD hath promised to them that love him let no man say we as tempted I'm tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tend to see any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed so we've heard this talk here there's no focus several years ago the four stages of death then when lust hath conceived the brandy so it's loss of conception and then sin and then when Santa's fans to bring forth death just like she lusted after the idea that the serpent presented to her then she conceived it which means she accepted it and the woman her mind first and then it brought us and course the natural life but also unbelief you know against the Word of God and that led to natural death and also spiritually being separated you know we thought this sin process away from thought it doesn't bring a student do not hear my blood brother every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of burning of his own will begat he us with the word truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures wherefore I'm loved rather and let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive them with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be doers of the word and not hearers only receiving deceiving your own selves for any of the a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man beholding his natural face in the glass 3 beholdeth himself and goeth away his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and containment therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed being a man among you seem to be religious and private not his tongue but deceiveth is on heart this man wanted him to think he returned to follow for God and the father is this to visit the fatherless in their affliction to keep himself unspotted from the world Oh I saw that's really small hoping to see a little bit that next visit from the seven churches brother Bentham said I know your faith now it does not say here as he did to the church and permits you hold my faith he's not talking about his faith now but he is commended them for their faithfulness but as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness where it says in James 1 the trying of your faith worketh patience there's also no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of faith Romans 5 tribulation worketh patience how high they go regards this not working of our patience is seen in James 1 4 but let patient have a perfect work that you may be perfect in attire lucky nothing God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient has lamb led to the slaughter loving a faithful witness of God that's all they wanted of life this service to their Lord how great was to be the reward one reason we thought wait for God is because of our unbelief we really don't believe he can or will do what we asked so we try to bring things to pass our own way we ought to trust God and all things we ask for knowing that gets faithful and will absolutely bring us work of pass the supposed saying are there ordered my objective is to help y'all see that God is always faithful he'll do what it said we're gonna matter how long we have to wait he'll do what it says Hebrews 10 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised Ephesians 3 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church by Christ he is but all ladies role without him okay from the staff roof man Brett now brother Brown I was talking about the scene in Acts true except for two in the upper room no no no we ain't got it yeah because he said there will come what would take place in the last days with stammering lips other tongues will I speak to those people and this is the rest that I said I was there 28 so this is it you'll get it when we'll know when it comes well know when it comes what of it promise of the Father there he waited nine days so they were patient and waiting in the upper room when the temptation was there for them to go on out saying we have it now let's just go on they had to sit there and wait patiently for God that's a long time you know sit there wait four days and then on the tenth day we were there and that patience away now if you got that kind of patience after God gives you a promise you've seen in the Bible it's mine then wait then if you got back final patients add it to your face and see how high you're getting now you're getting way up there now I froze up hang on okay well can you all see that I might have to do it from here I don't know why it's doing that Isaiah 40:31 I've had but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew which means to change for better and strong spurring means to renew means to change for better their strength power of God they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint yeah Hebrews 10:26 for he I mean of patients that after you've done the will of God you might receive why to do that this is actually working off my cell phone so maybe I don't have a signal good yeah there we go hi for you have need of patients that have you've done the will of God you might receive the promise we're getting a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man brought back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back in the provision but of them that believe - or unto or towards the saving of the soul which is to means like the journey you know we continue on the journey were not drawing that were not deterred from our purpose work on free the testimony of the true witness we need a waiting on God to the Holy Ghost comes with the power of deliverance we need salvation it's not evangelist when these salvation we can take this mountain who is that mountain before thurible it will be like a claim God said remain in the land you know brother Dale has increased a lot about salvation we've heard love people here later talking about just plain old simple salvation and we need that when a mr. Brandt playing all several gospel and that God over something new smoking works the original seat that's what crisis has found good wait that's what's the matter people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position we've got to manufacture something work up something initially I've been speaking in tongues to get more members in the church all this kind of tommyrot instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ it's making himself known among our people hear his voice brother Graham said we don't have time to hear the voice of the Lord and those who do claim to be Christians just kneel down of a little prayer like this some kind of homemade or bless me and my family take care of us good night and the next morning rise up and say just guys to the day a good day which will wait on the Lord you see we do all the talking we don't give him a chance to talk back to us and if we would pray and French our soul comes to the presence of God and then just relax and listen to his voice but there's so many voices today this takes the voice of the Lord away from us [Applause] the hours calmer the Venice said well that's where we missed the blessings were afraid to wait on God just a bit see you've heard that only wait again I hear that whisper only way it won't be very long even now the father's hand is pleading soon with Jesus we will sing the victory song that's right just wait on God believe it confess it stay with it and God Levant to pass through you now here's more don't wanna interject because I don't want to be misunderstood when you say wait or rest it seems like maybe a lot of people might think that means doing nothing and I'm not saying don't do anything you can be seeking God while you're waiting on God to move you up in Revelation and or for healing or whatever you know just keep believing the patient away but never stop seeking God father's 24 mrs. Solomon all right I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face the road and the stone wall thereof was broken down then I saw unconsidered it well I looked upon it and receive instruction get a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so so that poverty calm as want to travel it and I want as an armed man this is the best picture I could find on the internet to represent what solomon looked at so here's a slothful man laid down sleep he's got a field behind him all right now that field has potential to grow a crop he could sow porn he could sow wheat and if he would cultivate it and work it and make sure it's watered and protect it you know surrounded with a bill the hedge around a stone wall to protect it from critters and from winds and from whatever else may come upon it he would have a good crop now that represents the womb of our mind we have a womb of our mind that we stole the Word of God in the name of our mind we slow down the word and let God come and quicken but we have to keep cold thing we have to keep studying in studying the Word of God and pray in a seeking God and not being slothful his idea was just so the scenes and lay down and sleep and see what happens that's not intentional that's not deliberate that's not patient that's not anything really that was your biggest Christians so being patient does not mean doing nothing I'm gonna break down that verse again that I've just read parts 24 I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding it did not understand a simple law of sowing and reaping he didn't understand you have to cultivate the field you can understand you have to work with feel pull the tears out you know and and and maybe spray it with whatever to keep the bugs off of it or whatever you know he did not understand the simple of all of that but what
