[11:11] blessed be the god and father
[11:15] the word blessed be the god even father
[11:18] of our lord jesus christ who has blessed
[11:20] us with all spiritual blessings
[11:22] in heavenly places in christ now
[11:25] remember i made the statement this
[11:27] morning
[11:28] that we're got up we were using abraham
[11:31] we'll still refer back
[11:33] but we're using abraham the old
[11:35] testament people
[11:36] now we're coming into the new testament
[11:39] form
[11:41] so this is this is speaking to me and
[11:43] you now this is bringing it into the
[11:44] bride of christ
[11:46] because watch the scripture according as
[11:48] he has chosen us in him
[11:51] before the foundation of the world
[11:54] that we should be holy and without blame
[11:56] before him in love
[11:58] having predestinated us unto the
[12:01] adoption of children now what
[12:04] certain positions certain spots for this
[12:06] last days
[12:08] by jesus christ to himself according to
[12:10] the good pleasure of his will
[12:12] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[12:14] wherein he has made us accepted
[12:16] in the beloved in whom we have
[12:19] redemption through his blood the
[12:20] forgiveness of sins according to the
[12:22] riches
[12:24] of his grace wherein he hath abounded
[12:26] that were heaped it up pilate on us
[12:30] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[12:33] having made known unto us the mystery
[12:38] of his will
[12:42] now in romans
[12:46] uh colossians and timothy
[12:50] you find a mystery there of the
[12:52] engrafting of the gentiles
[12:54] okay but this is not that mystery part
[12:58] this is a great mystery and the prophet
[13:01] says in the adoption series
[13:03] having made known unto us the mystery of
[13:05] his will he said
[13:07] to adopt us
[13:10] all right now that's the mystery of his
[13:11] will so now we're going into that see
[13:14] according to his good pleasure which he
[13:16] has purpose in himself
[13:18] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[13:21] of time
[13:22] in other words somewhere a dispensation
[13:24] somewhere a predestinated plan
[13:27] somewhere a destiny is set
[13:31] in the fullness of times that he might
[13:33] gather together in one
[13:34] all things in christ both which are in
[13:37] heaven
[13:38] and which are on earth even in him you
[13:40] may be seated the lord at his blessing
[13:43] to the reading of the word so now do you
[13:45] understand what we're doing
[13:50] because there is a difference between
[13:51] the old testament salvation
[13:54] and the new testament the old testament
[13:57] salvation
[13:59] was speaking of a time to come sure
[14:02] that it would be jesus christ would come
[14:04] on the scene
[14:06] but as far as the time it could only be
[14:08] made manifest
[14:10] because as we're saying this morning see
[14:12] that jesus christ had not come
[14:14] and died all right until he died
[14:18] you didn't have redemption you had only
[14:22] the blood of bulls and goats speaking
[14:24] of that redemption to come
[14:28] you didn't have the new birth in the old
[14:29] testament they had a promise
[14:32] you know of a coming messiah they had a
[14:35] promise that
[14:36] they could go to uh to the uh
[14:39] regions of the blessed and wait
[14:42] until it would come time for them to
[14:44] come forth
[14:45] you know and some did in the
[14:46] resurrection of the lord jesus
[14:49] and uh but now so just remember what i'm
[14:52] getting at
[14:54] we're coming up now to where we are
[14:58] as i said i just brought that to you
[15:00] where you'd remember it see some people
[15:02] would say well the mystery we know the
[15:03] mystery of misters engrafting to the
[15:04] gentile
[15:05] okay that's right but now that's not
[15:07] this scripture
[15:08] this scripture is not applying to the
[15:11] engrafting of the gentiles
[15:14] all right now listen what i'm saying
[15:17] because that's romans
[15:19] colossians in first timothy
[15:22] that you have a mystery of the
[15:24] engrafting of the
[15:26] gentiles see because there was no
[15:29] promise back there was nothing in the
[15:30] old testament about
[15:31] us we just had little spots like
[15:34] rahab the harlot would speak of it uh
[15:37] you know this would speak of it you
[15:38] could just speak of
[15:40] the coming in of the gentiles because we
[15:42] had no uh connection we were not ours
[15:47] we were not ours we had to be brought
[15:49] into a position
[15:51] to an inheritance or brought into heirs
[15:54] of redemption through the blood of jesus
[15:57] christ
[15:58] all right so then that's you know that's
[16:01] word
[16:02] that we're doing but that's just laying
[16:04] that down where you won't
[16:06] get the thought in your mind it's a
[16:07] mystery well that's that's in gras
[16:09] there is a mystery of the engrafting of
[16:11] the gentiles
[16:13] okay but that's not this scripture this
[16:16] is a scripture
[16:17] of a predestinated predetermined
[16:21] position
[16:23] that someone must reach
[16:26] now i'm putting this out before i start
[16:27] the message part it may take a couple of
[16:29] messages
[16:30] to get through the adoption but that's
[16:32] all right
[16:33] but i'm just making the point to you the
[16:35] word that you'll think about it
[16:38] that this is the adopting into the
[16:41] family
[16:44] and brother brown said that's where the
[16:45] pentecostals even made their mistake
[16:48] he said they come up to the baptism of
[16:50] the holy ghost the new birth and he said
[16:51] they received the new birth
[16:54] but said then they stopped
[16:59] well see then that's why the prophet had
[17:02] to come
[17:04] a predestinated seed was laying in the
[17:07] word as i said this morning
[17:09] a destiny for somebody to reach and it
[17:12] was reached by a prophet in the last
[17:14] days
[17:15] to bring the gentile dispensation
[17:18] to a close all right so now get the
[17:21] difference between the two so that way
[17:23] you want to
[17:24] i do that because maybe some of you may
[17:26] call it well that confuses me
[17:28] well to others it's not confusing
[17:31] because
[17:32] they're they have in their mind their
[17:33] thoughts bless the gentiles being
[17:35] engrafted in
[17:36] no i'll give you the scriptures this is
[17:39] where they are
[17:40] here's where we are this is not the end
[17:44] grafting of the gentiles to see
[17:45] watch what i'm saying this is to where
[17:50] let's read it according as he has chosen
[17:53] us in him
[17:54] before the foundation of the world that
[17:57] we should be holding without blame
[17:58] before him in love
[18:00] having predestinated
[18:04] set a destiny a destiny is set
[18:08] for someone all right having
[18:11] predestinated
[18:12] us unto the prophet said unto
[18:16] he said now like i go into the water
[18:17] fountain i go into the door i go
[18:20] it's something that is a travel emotion
[18:23] has been taking place
[18:24] in travel and it's going to a place
[18:28] but it's going to a position that is
[18:31] destinated for this last days
[18:34] we have a predestinated destiny
[18:39] all right now i want you to take that
[18:41] and just keep it in your mind cause
[18:42] we'll keep probably referring back to it
[18:45] in the next message or two to where we
[18:47] can follow it
[18:49] that we're not just haphazardly
[18:52] see in other words
[18:56] if it had stopped and the prophet had
[18:58] not been sent
[19:01] we would have been to the new birth
[19:04] sure we would have went to glory by
[19:06] passing home but everyone went by the
[19:08] grave right
[19:11] if you understand what i'm getting at
[19:13] this is a predestinated destiny that
[19:15] someone must come to the adoption
[19:19] in coming to the adoption we come to the
[19:21] position
[19:22] of a body change
[19:26] because redemption covers the body as
[19:30] well as the soul
[19:32] so then we're predestinated see unto
[19:35] adoption by jesus christ to himself
[19:38] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:40] will okay
[19:42] what for now having made known
[19:45] unto us the mystery
[19:49] of his will see we're the only people
[19:52] that knows this mystery
[19:55] you follow me even the pentecostals that
[19:57] come up in line and were lined up and
[19:59] going good
[20:00] and all but still they never reached
[20:02] that right
[20:04] now you understand why the prophet would
[20:06] have to preach
[20:08] over and over the uh uh grain of wheat
[20:12] corn of wheat the things of coming in
[20:15] the promises there
[20:16] and all of those messages would be the
[20:19] christ
[20:20] the mystery of god reveal the which is
[20:23] more than just the end grafting of the
[20:25] gentiles
[20:26] that was taken place back there at
[20:28] calvary
[20:30] because when jesus christ was crucified
[20:32] see then the message was taken out peter
[20:34] went to the gentiles
[20:36] all right that fulfills those scriptures
[20:39] but it didn't fulfill this scripture
[20:43] this scripture comes forth as a
[20:45] predestinated position
[20:47] a destiny for somebody to reach
[20:52] we're in that day and time to where that
[20:54] we could that that can be reached
[20:57] let's see what's got to be who else is
[20:59] going to do it
[21:01] what are we going to do we're going to
[21:02] sit around here and wait another 20
[21:03] years
[21:05] most of us ain't going to be here you
[21:08] know
[21:08] and what they are is going to be in
[21:09] nursing homes
[21:11] so it may not be a joke that i've always
[21:14] made about it in the minister's meeting
[21:15] fellowship meetings you know i always
[21:17] tell them saying lord don't hurry up and
[21:18] get back we're gonna
[21:19] we're gonna start having fellowship
[21:21] meetings in the nursing homes
[21:23] well you know that's pretty close
[21:26] all right but see somebody has got to
[21:29] to step forth and move into it and know
[21:33] now listen brother branham in referring
[21:36] to
[21:38] gifts and callings that's in my mind i
[21:40] thought
[21:41] in the gifts and callings he brings out
[21:43] moses
[21:44] and he said see thou moses knew
[21:48] the word and i thought oh yeah
[21:52] hey that's him he said moses
[21:56] knew the word see in other words he knew
[21:58] the word for his day because he was
[22:00] living the word
[22:02] he was walking in the word for his day
[22:05] and he knew where he was at he knew
[22:07] where his calling was
[22:09] all he had to depend on the fact of that
[22:11] burning bush to be god
[22:13] you know god in the bush that's all he
[22:15] had to depend on because
[22:16] that would take care of it because the
[22:18] one in the bush said throw down your
[22:20] stick and he throw down his stick it
[22:21] becomes a snake he's take it back up
[22:23] he said with this you're going to take
[22:24] over egypt
[22:26] all right what are you following me now
[22:28] so that we can get a
[22:30] a point and then we'll back out of it
[22:32] and and move back into
[22:34] understanding because
[22:38] see if moses knew the plan
[22:43] all right then he was the man with the
[22:46] word
[22:49] okay now think about that
[22:53] think about that to be coming down here
[22:55] to where that the prophet was sent
[23:00] a predestinated gift
[23:03] i'll cover those in the gifts where the
[23:06] brother around says they're
[23:06] predestinated
[23:08] and he says it's predestinated eternally
[23:12] now it's not the person come on i'll
[23:15] i don't mind quoting the rest of the
[23:17] word because like i'm saying about
[23:19] choosing and you choosing then i
[23:22] i don't mind telling you the rest of the
[23:24] word
[23:25] all right because there has to be a
[23:29] people
[23:31] to make manifest the message
[23:35] that the prophet has brought
[23:38] to this being the prophet coming a
[23:40] predestination that's wonderful
[23:43] god would send us a prophet but there's
[23:46] got to be a people now take
[23:48] that because
[23:51] that's where we stand in the last days
[23:55] not waiting on god to do anything i'm
[23:57] not waiting on him to do it he's doing
[23:59] it
[23:59] right i'm not preaching i've been
[24:01] preaching this message now for 50 years
[24:03] and i've never preached a past tense
[24:06] message i've never preached something of
[24:10] the past you have to tell about the past
[24:13] but i've always preached a future tense
[24:16] or a
[24:17] present tense of the way i like it
[24:19] because there at the burning bush when
[24:21] he said i
[24:21] am that i am that means ever present for
[24:24] eternity
[24:25] in other words why would moses try to
[24:27] even think about being afraid
[24:29] when he had to i am with him
[24:33] he said moses go down there i'm going
[24:36] with you
[24:38] i'm going to take care of it i'm going
[24:40] with you
[24:43] see the day that we're living the time
[24:48] is valuable to us don't worry about
[24:51] these things don't worry about your
[24:53] plagues and your viruses and things like
[24:55] that sure we're human beings hey come on
[25:02] but we're not to just stay that when
[25:03] we're waiting well
[25:06] i've had the virus and i just don't feel
[25:09] too good
[25:10] well start confessing the truth about it
[25:14] that you are healed
[25:17] that'll bring you to a position to move
[25:18] out of that situation
[25:20] you keep talking about how bad it is you
[25:22] just stay there
[25:25] that's the point i'm trying to get you
[25:26] to see somebody's going to reach a
[25:28] position in this day
[25:31] that is predestinated or was
[25:33] predestinated before the world ever
[25:36] begun
[25:38] for a group of people to walk in the
[25:40] last day word the present tense message
[25:44] and say i am that i am
[25:48] he made me that's right
[25:52] if not what are we doing here i mean
[25:55] come on that's like i said i've been
[25:56] here 50 years doing this
[25:58] i've never been down on the basis of
[26:01] wondering what's going on i've always
[26:04] been
[26:05] positive of trying to preach what's
[26:07] going on that's why we never got caught
[26:09] with all of these doctrines and ideas
[26:11] and things
[26:12] because with the same thing of of them
[26:14] coming
[26:15] a warning came to us to say no that's
[26:18] not
[26:19] it right here's the word
[26:23] if moses could have the word why can't
[26:25] you and me how the word
[26:27] after it's been delivered unto us by the
[26:29] prophet
[26:31] we don't have to worry about it it's
[26:32] been delivered unto us
[26:35] step out and take your position
[26:40] and say this is what he's done
[26:43] and to think about that he has
[26:48] come in the last days himself
[26:52] not the prophet not the man he came
[26:55] himself in the last days
[26:58] in the person of jesus christ to walk on
[27:00] this earth
[27:02] i believe that a prophet is god's
[27:05] mouthpiece he is instead of god for me
[27:09] and you
[27:10] he's not in god's stead to take over and
[27:12] do something
[27:14] but he's there to direct us
[27:17] what else would we want
[27:21] why would we be concerned i mean what
[27:23] what's the point and like i said though
[27:26] you keep everything lined up
[27:29] and then you don't have well well we're
[27:31] just mystery
[27:32] he's talking about a mystery we know
[27:35] that the baptist well sure did i did i
[27:37] noted in the baptist
[27:38] that the gentile dispensation had come
[27:40] forth and it was a gentile dispensation
[27:43] from the day of pentecost up
[27:45] because that the gentiles would be
[27:47] coming in
[27:48] and that there was no part back in the
[27:50] old testament about the gentiles
[27:52] to tell you anything about it other than
[27:53] little spots here in yonder
[27:55] of something happening a rahab the
[27:57] harlot or something like that
[28:02] why can't we just well
[28:07] all right to make sure we follow and
[28:10] understand
[28:12] how does god choose
[28:16] that's why we preached that message this
[28:18] morning titled it
[28:20] which is the the predestination made
[28:22] plain number three but really the title
[28:24] of the message was
[28:27] election and calling
[28:33] make sure your calling in election is
[28:36] sure
[28:37] make sure you're in the word
[28:41] don't get caught playing around let's
[28:44] see what is the word the prophet said
[28:46] being in the wrong ranks it's it's a
[28:48] rapture would be no excuse
[28:50] now you answer that one he said being in
[28:53] the wrong ranks at the rapture
[28:54] would be no excuse and now the only way
[28:57] i can do is just read that and just
[28:59] understand what to say it
[29:01] if i'm not ready then there ain't going
[29:04] to be no change of this body for me
[29:07] they may be for you but it ain't going
[29:08] to be for me if i'm not ready
[29:11] so it's my responsibility to make myself
[29:15] available
[29:16] to that and that's making yourself
[29:18] available to the word that's why i spend
[29:20] so much time
[29:21] in trying to bring you to the word
[29:24] and getting you to see things that's
[29:25] like saying about well this is not the
[29:27] reign in the gentile see people's mind
[29:29] gets locked in on those things
[29:31] and they just it just cuts off
[29:34] but see that's not what it is this it's
[29:36] the mystery to have his
[29:38] will which his will is his word and his
[29:41] word
[29:42] is the end time adoption
[29:47] right to adopt his people
[29:51] to become his children is one thing but
[29:53] to adopt it
[29:55] see all right now what was it
[30:00] what did we find then why did god choose
[30:04] the way he has
[30:07] without it being a respecter of person
[30:10] how does he do it
[30:13] all right now he did choose
[30:16] but remember as we studied on the you
[30:18] know the point that many are show
[30:20] many are but fewer chosen
[30:24] many are called but fewer chosen all
[30:26] right so we've got to find ourselves in
[30:29] the word
[30:31] and finding ourselves in the word we
[30:32] wind up talking about then
[30:34] president kent's gospel not something of
[30:37] the past not something in the future
[30:40] but what is taking place right now
[30:49] the only way you'll ever have any faith
[30:50] in the word of god is to have something
[30:52] present tense
[30:56] right well i why why don't we believe it
[31:00] that way
[31:01] now listen what was it about talking
[31:02] about abraham
[31:05] what was it about abraham
[31:08] what was it about mary that we were
[31:10] talking about this morning
[31:13] that made her to be chosen
[31:17] when the world was full of virgins
[31:20] the world was full of young girls
[31:24] capable of fitting into the category
[31:28] of mary but why did he come to mary
[31:36] because he knew by his foreknowledge
[31:39] what she was going to do right
[31:41] right he knew when he contacted her
[31:45] that by his foreknowledge what she was
[31:48] going to do
[31:49] and say now you agree now that's that's
[31:52] holding it all to predestination
[31:55] by foreknowledge he knew
[31:58] what she would do he knew what
[32:02] abraham would do
[32:05] and he knew that abraham would teach his
[32:07] children the prophet said
[32:09] that's a great thing to me
[32:14] he had confidence in abraham
[32:18] he turned around he had so much
[32:19] confidence in moses he said moses go
[32:21] down there
[32:23] he said and don't worry about it
[32:27] so just take that stick and mind me of
[32:30] what i tell you to do
[32:32] when i tell you to throw the stick down
[32:34] you just throw the stick down that's all
[32:36] you got to do you ain't got to do this
[32:38] or that or the other
[32:39] you ain't got to show great signs and
[32:41] wonders and power
[32:42] i'll take care of it
[32:46] and he took over a whole nation
[32:55] because listen
[32:59] i said mary when she said that
[33:04] she said be it unto me according to your
[33:08] word
[33:10] do you realize that's what god wanted
[33:12] somebody to say
[33:15] you realize now come on listen oh you
[33:18] just preached philosophies
[33:21] what are you going to preach it with
[33:24] how many how many young virgins do you
[33:26] think god maybe have dealt with in that
[33:28] day
[33:35] no no no no he he predestined okay now
[33:38] you're getting back to where i'm at so
[33:40] come on
[33:42] he knew before the world ever begun he
[33:44] had already seen it he knew it would
[33:46] take place
[33:49] he knew what would happen with mary and
[33:52] what she would do
[33:55] and when she said be it unto me
[33:56] according to that word
[33:58] that settled within her heart and
[34:00] brother brown said it gave her
[34:02] two wounds virgin
[34:08] two wounds one was her mind
[34:13] now how would you do it when you turn
[34:15] around in and like mary was go home and
[34:17] have to tell joseph
[34:18] which it meant death if he turned her
[34:20] down
[34:23] that's why it was an old man see why it
[34:25] was a married man
[34:28] come on i'm just giving you natural
[34:30] stories of what it is
[34:31] that was the reason it turned out to be
[34:33] that he had to find some man
[34:35] that would accept that
[34:38] not just mary had to find a man that
[34:41] would accept her
[34:42] and it had to be a married man because a
[34:45] young man just wouldn't go along with it
[34:48] sorry to talk like that and god knows my
[34:50] heart and what i'm trying to say
[34:55] but you see he had to accept her
[35:00] jerry had a dream all right but he had
[35:03] to believe the dream
[35:05] what if the devil gave him a dream the
[35:06] next night
[35:09] he had to come to a place to believe
[35:11] that that was god talking to him right
[35:15] that was the case that was the scenario
[35:17] the story whatever you want to call it
[35:19] was for him also to believe it
[35:24] now you can see what i was talking about
[35:25] this morning god choosing that's right
[35:28] he chose you
[35:30] but you must accept what he chose
[35:37] you must accept him in salvation he's
[35:40] not going to make you take it
[35:44] all right what was we talking about what
[35:48] have we been talking about in abraham
[35:51] abraham according to
[35:56] three scriptures romans 4
[35:59] 3 says for what saith the scripture
[36:01] abraham believed god and it was in
[36:03] it was counted unto him for
[36:05] righteousness that's romans 4 and 3.
[36:08] galatians 3 and 6. even if abraham
[36:11] believed god and it was accounted to him
[36:13] for righteousness
[36:14] james 3 and 23 and the scripture was
[36:17] fulfilled which saith
[36:20] the scripture was fulfilled which saith
[36:22] abraham believed god
[36:23] and it was imputed unto him for
[36:25] righteousness and he was called
[36:28] the friend of god
[36:31] wouldn't that be something to be able to
[36:34] think that you're
[36:36] you could say i've got this wonderful
[36:39] friend i'd like to
[36:40] introduce you to who is he it's the lord
[36:43] jesus christ
[36:46] he's my wonderful friend
[36:51] abraham believed god
[36:54] in other words plain language to get it
[36:56] straight he believed god was talking to
[36:59] him
[37:00] amen right
[37:04] when that once appeared to him he
[37:07] believed
[37:08] that one and it's not necessarily there
[37:10] in the first part
[37:11] which is genesis 12. when he appeared to
[37:14] abraham
[37:15] it doesn't talk about him appearing
[37:17] physically maybe he did i don't know i
[37:19] ain't going to argue with you about it
[37:20] because they know we need of it
[37:22] i'm just gonna say it it doesn't say
[37:24] that that god come down in the evening
[37:26] and
[37:27] walked around with him no that's two or
[37:28] three chapters later
[37:31] that he contacts god god contacts
[37:34] abraham and just keeps
[37:35] time after time coming until he finally
[37:37] appears to him in a human form
[37:41] do you understand abraham believed god
[37:47] and it was counted
[37:50] or reckoned or imputed
[37:58] that he was a man of god that he could
[38:01] believe him
[38:04] know and being
[38:07] imputed unto him he could wind up being
[38:10] the friend of god
[38:14] what a wonderful position that you could
[38:17] spend months preaching on that very
[38:19] thing
[38:21] but get what i'm talking about now
[38:26] why was it that abraham
[38:29] was accepted
[38:33] is because that he believed god
[38:39] you say well i believe the lord
[38:44] well you know what now here's where
[38:47] maybe it's going to come down into us
[38:48] real hard
[38:50] see we prove what we believe right
[38:54] we prove whether we believe or not now
[38:57] you tell me
[38:57] i believe this message but yet you do
[39:01] like the people of this message are
[39:02] doing
[39:04] and acting and things and saying brother
[39:07] branham was wrong here and wrong here
[39:09] and this
[39:09] that and the other and then you tell me
[39:11] they believe god i'm going to tell you
[39:12] you're a liar
[39:16] i'm going to tell you you don't believe
[39:18] it
[39:22] and god knows whether we believe him or
[39:24] not right
[39:25] are you pulling anything over on him to
[39:27] be able to say lord i believe you now
[39:29] lord you know
[39:30] you know me now lord you know i believed
[39:32] you
[39:38] but think about it
[39:42] god came to abraham's believing
[39:49] all right that's the point i've made for
[39:53] three services coming into four now
[39:58] abraham done something
[40:04] that got god's attention
[40:10] and what was it he believed god
[40:13] not just believing in a god
[40:17] not just accepting that there is a god
[40:19] that's not salvation
[40:21] salvation is not because you're doing it
[40:22] salvation is when you believe it to the
[40:24] point that the person
[40:26] of jesus christ comes and lives in you
[40:29] in the new birth then you can say you
[40:32] believe him
[40:38] see no wonder faith is the substance of
[40:40] things hoped for
[40:42] because that's what abraham had for his
[40:44] day it was like who was it the other
[40:46] night was bringing it out
[40:47] uh the word brother louise i guess
[40:49] somebody where
[40:50] the word faith is only two times in the
[40:52] old testament
[40:55] two hundred and something in the new
[40:57] because it's not an old testament word
[41:02] the best you can do with the old
[41:03] testament wording would come out to be
[41:06] faith in god
[41:12] it is not a new testament it's not used
[41:14] there
[41:15] as it is in the new testament that
[41:16] turned out to be the faith of god
[41:24] abraham had faith in god
[41:28] it didn't give him a new birth never
[41:31] gave him eternal life
[41:33] but it was a human man that's what i
[41:35] want you to see
[41:37] that's what i've always tried to preach
[41:38] about abraham that he was a man
[41:43] yet he was a band that god come in
[41:45] contact with
[41:48] and god used him and typed with him and
[41:50] showed this and that and the other and
[41:52] bringing it all the way through
[41:55] until he was called a friend of god
[41:59] david it says he was a man after god's
[42:01] own heart you say look how bad david was
[42:04] but yet look how wonderful he was as far
[42:06] as god was looking at
[42:07] god could tell him to go do something
[42:09] he'd do it
[42:11] he just directed him to do it he'd go do
[42:14] it
[42:16] it didn't make no difference sure he was
[42:19] a rascal or
[42:20] everything in the book but he believed
[42:22] god
[42:24] he said that giant
[42:27] that little wimp and y'all afraid of it
[42:31] then i tackled a bear i tackled a
[42:34] a lion and said you mean to tell me that
[42:38] you're afraid of that
[42:42] he said whatever it was that took care
[42:45] of me in the
[42:45] situation will take care of me now get
[42:48] out of the way
[42:53] don't give me none of your armor don't
[42:54] give me none of your goodies don't give
[42:56] me none of your gifts
[42:57] none of your doings none of all the
[42:59] things you could come up with
[43:00] just let me go myself
[43:04] he took care of it
[43:08] he went up there and told that giant he
[43:11] said today i'll cut your head off
[43:13] probably had a little small knife
[43:17] you know maybe he had a little small
[43:20] knife
[43:22] where'd he get the sword to cut off the
[43:24] giant's head
[43:26] from the giant
[43:29] all he had to do is get him on the
[43:30] ground and he run and took his
[43:32] sword from him and oh that was easy to
[43:35] do
[43:35] probably hard to pick up but once he
[43:38] dropped it
[43:39] off went ahead
[43:42] see he wasn't afraid
[43:49] you know i believe sometimes that a lot
[43:51] of people just get just enough salvation
[43:53] to get to where they were maybe a little
[43:55] bit and stop being afraid just a little
[43:57] bit
[43:58] but they're still afraid
[44:03] afraid of these viruses and things i've
[44:06] tried my best to tell you i told you to
[44:08] start with you
[44:09] when it started this is not the
[44:11] tribulation
[44:13] this is pre-tribulation
[44:18] tribulation is the wrath of god
[44:22] it's not just these small things uh
[44:25] talking to brother ernie villanueva last
[44:26] night
[44:27] or yesterday and he said they was not
[44:29] able to go to church up there
[44:31] they were kind of like the way we done
[44:32] it said they they had the speaker
[44:35] the uh music the song leader and they
[44:38] could have the
[44:39] like track people keep up you know and
[44:41] stuff like that that what you would call
[44:42] it
[44:43] he said that's all they can go to church
[44:45] so you know what they're doing
[44:47] they're driving over into the united
[44:49] states
[44:50] because they bought that camp thing and
[44:52] you know they they own some kind of big
[44:54] camp area they got
[44:55] they're going to church there
[44:58] well that's a good smart thing to do
[45:01] you know what i mean it's like he was
[45:04] saying he said sam it's here it's done
[45:07] yeah they can do anything they want to
[45:11] they can go down there at the border
[45:12] right now and tell them they can't cross
[45:13] that and go over there
[45:15] if you go over there you're going to
[45:16] stay over there for 14 days or something
[45:19] that can be done
[45:22] but are we afraid of that
[45:29] we're not foolish never have believed it
[45:32] i was too foolish maybe a little stupid
[45:34] but not too foolish
[45:36] because i've always thought and believed
[45:38] in god that could take care of us
[45:44] okay
[45:48] so what happened god found him a man
[45:53] that would believe him
[45:57] but you know what god had it over on
[46:00] abraham you know why because god had
[46:03] already seen abraham
[46:06] right god had already seen abraham
[46:10] accept what he was doing and do the
[46:12] thing so he's just waiting on the man
[46:14] that's all he's doing with me and you
[46:16] that's right
[46:18] he's just waiting on us to step up right
[46:25] see the bride has got to realize who she
[46:28] is
[46:30] and that's what the prophet said is that
[46:32] when she does that she will be an
[46:34] invincible army
[46:37] when she believes who she is
[46:41] satan will be powerless the prophet said
[46:44] before us
[46:45] yeah but i just don't believe that well
[46:47] see that's what don't worry about it
[46:49] you're not going to be one of the chosen
[46:50] to stay here
[46:51] now i'm saying this the way i want it
[46:53] you're not going to be
[46:54] them that lies to the liest we're going
[46:57] to go by the grave if we don't have
[46:58] enough faith
[46:59] to be able to stand on the word of god
[47:02] and believe who we are
[47:03] and what we're doing we're going by the
[47:05] grave
[47:09] you think i have any trouble saying what
[47:11] i've taught you 40 or
[47:12] something years ago that i believe god
[47:15] showed me then
[47:16] that the biggest portion of the people
[47:17] of this message born-again believers
[47:20] i had no references and the reference
[47:22] was not to the basis
[47:23] of them not being the reference was of
[47:26] the people of the message would have to
[47:28] go by the grave
[47:29] because they cannot stand on the faith
[47:33] well i don't like you talking like that
[47:34] cause you're talking about my wife
[47:35] husband kids this
[47:37] die i'm not talking about them i'm
[47:40] telling the truth
[47:42] wherever one's going to die god don't do
[47:44] something in a hurry
[47:47] right
[47:51] come on i'm 80 years old what are you
[47:57] maybe we're like we used to be you know
[47:59] we talked about it after
[48:01] wednesday night i guess it was tony and
[48:03] a bunch of us were talking
[48:05] uh you know we used to when you had an
[48:07] old car and it got 50 000 miles on it
[48:09] you wouldn't got rid of it
[48:12] right some of you ain't old enough to
[48:14] remember that
[48:15] i'm well old enough to know that when
[48:17] you got 50 000 miles on a car you got
[48:19] rid of
[48:20] it because it was getting old
[48:23] it was worn out now
[48:26] you've got 500 000
[48:29] miles on your car and it's still running
[48:34] what happened
[48:39] somebody just got smart enough to say
[48:41] well hey i got fifty thousand i'll just
[48:43] drive this to 50
[48:44] 55 anyway i'll drive to 60 000. you get
[48:48] up to 60 say well i might as well just
[48:49] keep driving it for a while
[48:51] first thing you know you got a hundred
[48:52] thousand miles well let's keep driving
[48:53] for a while
[48:55] right well why can't we get in the same
[48:59] way with god on the basis that we can
[49:01] finally get to word that we can believe
[49:03] what he said about us
[49:08] now you have to admit when he says the
[49:10] bride
[49:14] that he's talking about the bride amen
[49:22] see just like i was talking about i
[49:23] believe i believe my thoughts was
[49:25] correct the bride of christ the biggest
[49:27] portion of
[49:28] is going to die and go by the grave why
[49:30] because they can't stand here
[49:32] and stand on their own two feet in the
[49:34] message and believe it
[49:38] so where else are we going
[49:47] come on where are we going to okay let's
[49:49] go
[49:52] was it not that abraham
[49:56] believed god
[50:01] and god looking at what abraham believed
[50:04] in him
[50:05] and he foreknew all about it anyway
[50:09] and he knowed what he would do but he
[50:11] wanted abraham to find out
[50:16] so he put him through tests and trials
[50:21] right he puts you and me through tests
[50:24] and trials
[50:25] to see what we'll do not what he know he
[50:27] already knows what we're going to do
[50:31] i just don't know what i'm going to do
[50:34] that's what i told the man at work down
[50:35] there he's thrown off on me about
[50:37] the message and believing in god and
[50:38] everything and was working across each
[50:40] other and
[50:41] he looked over me he said i want to just
[50:43] come over there and whoop you
[50:48] i said well if that's what you want to
[50:51] do
[50:52] you know i said but i'll remind you of
[50:55] one thing
[50:57] i try to be a christian but
[51:02] you don't know what you're doing coming
[51:04] over here and i don't know what i'm
[51:05] going to do when you get over here
[51:08] you know what he didn't get over there
[51:11] he turned around went back down the line
[51:12] working
[51:14] i was just being honest i don't know
[51:16] what i'd have done i hope i'd had enough
[51:18] grace
[51:19] to took a slap in the face and i've had
[51:21] that i always wondered what that'd take
[51:23] and the man one day down there at work
[51:24] slapped me just
[51:26] man did he knock me almost down
[51:32] and i just turned around and looked at
[51:35] him
[51:37] i just stood there and looked at him had
[51:38] about a half grin on my face
[51:43] because i was thinking
[51:48] something else holding on it's going to
[51:50] ain't me
[51:52] i wasn't afraid of him no more than
[51:54] being afraid of a 10 year old kid
[51:58] but i was just standing there grinning
[52:01] he just turned off and went on back down
[52:03] to his job and we worked pretty close
[52:04] together
[52:06] he didn't come up from where i was at
[52:07] for quite a while maybe 10 15 minutes
[52:12] he come up here and he said i shouldn't
[52:15] have done what i've done while ago
[52:18] i said it's all right
[52:22] see it proved the point it proves
[52:25] something can keep you
[52:27] if you'll let it and it'll turn out to
[52:30] be your end
[52:32] that guy was a best friend of mine from
[52:34] then on he was
[52:35] you know but listen church
[52:39] abraham believed god that was what got
[52:43] god's attention
[52:46] mary believed god
[52:51] go all the way through the bible with
[52:52] the warriors of faith
[52:55] now that they'd believe god
[52:58] sure it may be a david like i said that
[53:01] david knew he wasn't going to die until
[53:02] he sat on that throne
[53:04] because he would anoint it to be king he
[53:07] knew that
[53:09] it may be that way but there's a
[53:12] predestinated position for every one of
[53:15] us
[53:15] right
[53:18] see you say yeah but
[53:23] you know predestination i'm glad brother
[53:24] around said that he said now god didn't
[53:26] just put you in a pot and push you
[53:27] through
[53:28] the other end and said you overcome
[53:31] see he leaves you as to choose
[53:37] and to walk in your part
[53:41] but he wants you to choose he wants you
[53:44] to accept the point
[53:46] and walk in it are you following me
[53:54] so maybe one of these days we'll realize
[53:58] what happened in our christian
[54:00] experience
[54:05] that it'll click with us and we'll say
[54:08] he was there all the time
[54:11] waiting patiently in line i like that
[54:13] song
[54:16] or time wherever it goes there
[54:21] he's been waiting on me and you
[54:25] brother branham said it like that he
[54:26] said i forgot what he used on the end of
[54:29] it but he said if god can get one man
[54:32] in his hands
[54:35] he had one man in moses right
[54:39] he had one man in david he said if he
[54:41] can get one man i forgot how he
[54:43] said it maybe maybe it was if we could
[54:45] get one man in line he said the rapture
[54:47] would take place or something
[54:48] there's something on the end of it would
[54:50] be a marvelous thing that if he could
[54:52] just get one man
[54:54] well okay i'm reading this lord
[54:58] so evidently i ain't the one
[55:02] you know
[55:08] and i don't use excuses
[55:11] well you know i could have no no no no
[55:14] no
[55:14] no i face it just up front that's just
[55:16] the way i face things straight up front
[55:20] whatever god says about me and you why
[55:22] don't we believe it
[55:24] good or bad because even the bad
[55:27] can you can turn away from that and go
[55:29] back to the good
[55:32] things can be changed
[55:36] to where they're disdifferent that's why
[55:38] the predestination is not a
[55:40] stamped thing it is on one basis he back
[55:43] there
[55:44] saw it
[55:47] he stamped it there
[55:50] he didn't come down here and stamped
[55:52] here
[55:54] he saw you and me before we ever for the
[55:57] world ever begun
[55:58] sitting in church today
[56:03] if you don't think about god that way
[56:05] what kind of a god do you have
[56:08] a flim-flamed wednesday some kind of a
[56:14] situation
[56:18] could it be
[56:21] that what caused god to look at abraham
[56:28] he finally found somebody that had just
[56:31] a little bit of a love
[56:34] in his heart for him
[56:39] you don't think like that you don't
[56:42] think about the situation
[56:44] see i think about what could be without
[56:46] doing it that's where wade was telling
[56:48] him about that story that i told him
[56:50] and and i was just preaching on
[56:52] predestination
[56:54] and what i was talking about was as a
[56:56] girl like gilsen she was a methodist and
[56:59] you know i told the story about it i
[57:02] said i could have married her and
[57:04] wound up being a methodist preacher
[57:09] you just laugh at it i know because you
[57:10] don't understand what i'm talking about
[57:13] because you're thinking nothing can't
[57:15] happen that way
[57:19] i'm saying we do have a choice
[57:24] how long do you want to stand here and
[57:25] quote what the brother the prophet said
[57:27] you had a choice in who you married you
[57:29] had a choice in where you work
[57:30] you got a choice in this you got a
[57:32] choice in that that's right
[57:40] that's why i've always told my wife
[57:41] you'd have been better off if you chose
[57:42] one of them other guys
[57:44] i don't think my brother but that's
[57:46] right
[57:47] she used to date him a little bit but
[57:51] that was okay but all right listen
[57:55] now get to the point
[58:00] in romans
[58:03] what did i do yeah
[58:08] romans 4 and 3 it talks about abraham
[58:10] believed god
[58:13] and you know what his believing was
[58:16] counted unto him
[58:18] for righteousness the definition of the
[58:22] word righteousness or no
[58:24] comes from the word right
[58:28] you know and so right is something
[58:30] that's right
[58:33] and then you bring on to other ways
[58:35] through science i mean through
[58:37] the wording to bring it up but it's
[58:39] counted unto him
[58:40] for the right act
[58:44] or being right
[58:49] galatians says even as abraham believed
[58:52] god and it was accounted to him for
[58:55] righteousness
[58:57] james 3 and 23 three times god uses the
[59:01] phrase
[59:02] and let me quote the prophet if god
[59:04] repeats something
[59:06] you listen when it says verily verily i
[59:08] say unto thee
[59:10] he said listen to what's being said
[59:13] when he repeats himself he's got a
[59:16] reason
[59:18] three times he said abraham believed god
[59:22] and it was counted unto him for
[59:23] righteousness
[59:26] well could that be the very thing that
[59:27] god was looking at
[59:32] now remember he didn't have to do it
[59:33] down here he done it back there
[59:36] in his mind before the world he saw
[59:37] abraham and doing
[59:40] what abraham was doing down there when
[59:42] he come to that believing that walking
[59:43] out was a manifestation
[59:45] that was just like jesus stood as a lamb
[59:47] slain back there
[59:50] but you couldn't put that to the point
[59:52] of bringing no great things
[59:54] until he came to calvary and died
[59:58] then could come into manifestation a
[1:00:01] savior a healer
[1:00:02] a deliverer all right
[1:00:06] god's just waiting on you and me just to
[1:00:08] step out on his word
[1:00:10] and then let him step out amen okay
[1:00:14] so think on these things
[1:00:17] all right
[1:00:22] now getting to the message today
[1:00:26] he predestinated us having predestinated
[1:00:30] us
[1:00:30] unto the adoption of children
[1:00:35] all right now i'll read some of these in
[1:00:39] a minute but you know the story of
[1:00:40] adoption you've been around the message
[1:00:42] long enough to have heard it
[1:00:45] your adoption is not your new birth
[1:00:49] you've got to get into the family
[1:00:51] because in the old testament adoptional
[1:00:53] form
[1:00:54] it was the fact that the son you know
[1:00:57] was all a son
[1:00:58] from the time he was born into the
[1:01:00] family because he was born
[1:01:02] a dale he didn't become one
[1:01:06] he was born to dale he was born
[1:01:09] to that farmer or that person all right
[1:01:12] and see being born to that person
[1:01:15] he was a member of the family with
[1:01:18] inherit rights of everybody in the
[1:01:20] family
[1:01:22] okay but if that child as we'll really
[1:01:25] have time to get into some of it if that
[1:01:29] child behaved correctly
[1:01:32] then he could come to the adoptional
[1:01:34] point
[1:01:35] you know what that word bar vitsu and
[1:01:38] what it is what it talks about
[1:01:40] i can't never pronounce it correct we
[1:01:41] were able while we were there in israel
[1:01:44] uh i assume that's what they were doing
[1:01:45] because they were like a
[1:01:47] a bunch of them gathered at one place
[1:01:49] and and they was coming down and they
[1:01:51] was going through ceremonies and
[1:01:52] and taking of bread and doing things you
[1:01:54] know and and i think that was probably
[1:01:57] what we were viewing was
[1:01:59] that person out in the public to be
[1:02:01] declared
[1:02:02] to be a child of god you know all right
[1:02:06] but now think about it you're
[1:02:09] predestinated
[1:02:11] unto
[1:02:14] which means you're going from here to
[1:02:16] there
[1:02:18] which means a traveling journey unto all
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:22] it's not the position for you to sit
[1:02:24] down and become a nonchalant
[1:02:27] and that's what your adoptional form is
[1:02:29] covered in right
[1:02:31] if the child was acting like the father
[1:02:35] then it would finally come to where that
[1:02:37] the son could be
[1:02:39] adopted now i don't
[1:02:42] mean this wrong because i didn't write
[1:02:44] the book but uh
[1:02:45] i've never found an adoption for the
[1:02:48] girl
[1:02:49] the women right
[1:02:52] it always talks about a son i don't
[1:02:54] understand that
[1:02:56] i understand one time i believe in the
[1:02:57] new testament
[1:02:59] you take from the old testament it would
[1:03:00] be a son
[1:03:02] but i believe in the new testament is
[1:03:04] sons and daughters
[1:03:06] okay ladies i'm on your side
[1:03:09] i believe that you've got to be adopted
[1:03:12] too
[1:03:13] you i believe you've got to do it as
[1:03:15] well as your husband it's not your
[1:03:16] husband to do it for you
[1:03:19] you got to be that yourself i am not my
[1:03:22] wife's savior
[1:03:24] i can't perform as that or act as that
[1:03:29] she has to have her own faith her own
[1:03:32] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:34] but see in the old testament it was
[1:03:36] brought into a family as
[1:03:37] like a type the child born into the
[1:03:40] family
[1:03:41] would be a type of the baptism of the
[1:03:42] holy ghost to you
[1:03:44] in the new testament situation
[1:03:47] all right and that child if that child
[1:03:50] lived and done correctly
[1:03:52] he was taken out and finally adopted and
[1:03:55] given the position to where
[1:03:57] he could sign the check he could do
[1:03:59] anything he was just
[1:04:00] as much as in charge as the daddy was
[1:04:04] and correctly speaking but if random and
[1:04:07] bringing it we'll get to these things
[1:04:08] and do it
[1:04:09] really it's to the point that what he
[1:04:12] was saying this is my beloved son
[1:04:15] whom i'm pleased to dwell hear ye him he
[1:04:17] said
[1:04:19] god was simply saying i'm stepping back
[1:04:24] if you hear anything you're going to
[1:04:26] hear him
[1:04:28] the brother brandon preached a lot of
[1:04:29] messages called hear ye him
[1:04:31] i invite you to challenge me on it to
[1:04:33] see it
[1:04:34] a lot of that was not to adoptional
[1:04:36] situations
[1:04:38] in other words he wasn't explaining
[1:04:39] adoption as much as he was explaining
[1:04:41] the straight truth
[1:04:43] hear ye him
[1:04:47] you're god hear the word
[1:04:52] no matter where it's coming from no
[1:04:54] matter who the speaker is
[1:04:57] it's the word of god it's the word of
[1:04:59] god
[1:05:01] just as real as any word of god that he
[1:05:03] had written you know hand wrote himself
[1:05:07] you follow me see i'm on the side with
[1:05:10] sisters too
[1:05:12] huh
[1:05:15] oh but listen he predestinated a people
[1:05:20] unto adoption now that
[1:05:23] this as i said this morning and bring it
[1:05:25] back now that
[1:05:27] see this is a this is a present tense
[1:05:29] gospel
[1:05:32] it would have to be put somewhere in the
[1:05:34] bible
[1:05:35] the word that you could read it as being
[1:05:37] the finality
[1:05:40] you know the answer to all things and
[1:05:42] the statue of a perfect man is that
[1:05:44] so you add to your faith which is a
[1:05:46] born-again experience
[1:05:47] you add virtual knowledge what as you
[1:05:50] receive the word as it's being revealed
[1:05:52] to you
[1:05:53] you're growing up the stature of a
[1:05:54] perfect man we'll cover that
[1:05:58] but the point i want you to see about it
[1:05:59] is
[1:06:01] it's predestinated unto it's a journey
[1:06:04] and see you started the journey your
[1:06:07] journey as a christian
[1:06:08] started with the baptism of the holy
[1:06:10] ghost
[1:06:12] come on right now you started with the
[1:06:15] baptism of the holy ghost the new birth
[1:06:18] that was your start of your journey all
[1:06:20] right justification is just a work of
[1:06:23] the holy spirit
[1:06:24] sanctification is a work of the holy
[1:06:25] spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:06:28] spirit
[1:06:28] right all right so you started your
[1:06:31] journey
[1:06:32] in a new birth it brought you into the
[1:06:35] family of god
[1:06:37] gave you eternal life in your soul
[1:06:39] making your soul
[1:06:40] redeemed making you a son or daughter of
[1:06:43] god
[1:06:45] all right well see that's just the start
[1:06:48] of the journey
[1:06:49] because that's a baby
[1:06:55] every born and again believer starts
[1:06:56] their journey as a baby
[1:07:01] you don't start your journey as
[1:07:02] full-grown
[1:07:04] where would you find your types and
[1:07:05] things for it
[1:07:08] you start your journey it's the day
[1:07:10] you're born again
[1:07:11] that puts you in the body of christ but
[1:07:13] you're a baby
[1:07:15] desiring the sincere miracle of the word
[1:07:18] as the bible said that you may grow
[1:07:20] there by and being born again
[1:07:24] by the incorruptible word the statue of
[1:07:27] a perfect man can't be built by how much
[1:07:29] knowledge here is not just how much you
[1:07:31] can learn the message
[1:07:32] it's holy ghost knowledge it's the
[1:07:34] reveal word of god it's god's word
[1:07:36] revealed to you
[1:07:39] all right it puts you to a place to
[1:07:43] where
[1:07:43] that new birth just puts you in the body
[1:07:46] and there's where brother brown says
[1:07:49] your pentecostals messed up because you
[1:07:52] see he covered he said that
[1:07:54] justification had its time
[1:07:56] sanctification had its time
[1:07:58] in other words a predestinated seed a
[1:08:00] destiny
[1:08:01] luther destiny was the just shall live
[1:08:04] by faith
[1:08:05] protest the catholic church get out of
[1:08:07] there and leave that stuff alone
[1:08:10] that was his day a destiny he reached
[1:08:13] his destiny
[1:08:14] he had to go on then he had to go on by
[1:08:18] the grave
[1:08:19] wesley come along
[1:08:22] he done his part he sent the
[1:08:25] missionaries to the world and
[1:08:27] and the writings of the books and the
[1:08:28] things and on the bible and the songs
[1:08:30] and
[1:08:31] and things but that didn't finish it
[1:08:35] long come the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:37] on azusa street
[1:08:41] the prophet said that's where you made
[1:08:42] your mistake
[1:08:44] thinking that you got everything when
[1:08:46] you was born again he said when you
[1:08:47] didn't
[1:08:48] he said you just started
[1:08:53] come on take the natural story and see
[1:08:55] it with a spiritual
[1:08:57] you start your natural life as a baby
[1:09:00] right goo goo again all kind of things
[1:09:06] right but one day your journey has to
[1:09:10] complete
[1:09:11] in the basis of a growth development
[1:09:17] the baby has to grow up
[1:09:22] he said then we'll quit our little petey
[1:09:24] pattern and i've got to hear one
[1:09:26] i know i ain't going to get it today so
[1:09:27] i'll just use the parts of these notes
[1:09:30] and
[1:09:30] preach on it later i don't worry about
[1:09:31] it
[1:09:33] but see that child has to learn to walk
[1:09:36] right well you know what's the best
[1:09:38] thing about a child learning to walk
[1:09:42] i mean you don't want to hurt him and
[1:09:44] you don't don't go wrong with me just
[1:09:46] listen
[1:09:47] but you take him and you just stand him
[1:09:50] up against the wall
[1:09:52] you give him something to kind of get
[1:09:53] sturdy about on his back and then you
[1:09:55] walk away from him and say come on
[1:09:57] well now he's gonna fall
[1:10:01] right but you know in doing all that
[1:10:03] he's going to learn to walk
[1:10:06] then after they learn to walk you want
[1:10:07] them to sit down and shut up
[1:10:09] you know right you want them to learn to
[1:10:11] talk come on dad dad dad
[1:10:13] my mama come on come on come on and then
[1:10:15] they'll finally get to an end
[1:10:17] and be like i was one day coming road
[1:10:19] driving from all the way in atlanta and
[1:10:20] my brother-in-law was in the car with me
[1:10:22] and he had his boy with him and he was
[1:10:23] just a little small like fella
[1:10:25] and all the way up the road he said the
[1:10:27] same time
[1:10:29] over and over and over
[1:10:33] every mile that i went by it was over
[1:10:36] and over i wanted to spank him
[1:10:41] i'm sorry
[1:10:44] i wanted to at least tell him to shut up
[1:10:48] you know but he was growing up
[1:10:52] he finally learned to say some other
[1:10:54] things
[1:10:56] maybe that's why god sometimes spanks
[1:10:58] that's pretty good you know with kids
[1:11:00] crying
[1:11:01] you know and what do we tell the kids
[1:11:05] you tell them they fall down
[1:11:08] and then get up and go come on that
[1:11:11] didn't
[1:11:12] hurt well you know after a while that
[1:11:14] kind of gets in that kid's mind he said
[1:11:16] i felt i didn't hurt he gets something
[1:11:17] goes
[1:11:19] see he learns and that's what a child of
[1:11:22] god has to do
[1:11:25] we'll read these things as we go along
[1:11:26] and just bring some more about it
[1:11:28] but see you're predestinated i want you
[1:11:30] to get the point
[1:11:31] you're predestinated to a certain
[1:11:34] position
[1:11:35] zeus street was pentecostal
[1:11:38] predestinated
[1:11:40] a position of the new birth
[1:11:45] and your prophet said they turned it
[1:11:47] down
[1:11:51] well see somebody has got to go beyond
[1:11:55] the new birth
[1:11:59] somebody has got to go to a position
[1:12:04] i know you don't like it because i know
[1:12:05] what people think when you say anything
[1:12:07] think you're exalted or whatever but
[1:12:09] i've told you enough that you ought to
[1:12:10] know that
[1:12:11] at least i've done it but in 1969 in
[1:12:13] athens georgia i preached a message
[1:12:15] called
[1:12:17] the bride of jesus christ would be the
[1:12:19] son of man
[1:12:20] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:12:24] 1969 when others were dealing with
[1:12:27] whether brother branham was wrong i hear
[1:12:29] about this dates and that was this
[1:12:31] they was doing that back in the 70s we
[1:12:32] had ministers meetings about those
[1:12:34] things
[1:12:36] but it's like i told you back in that
[1:12:38] day you had enough old people to stand
[1:12:40] up
[1:12:41] and they stood firmly on the bases it
[1:12:44] didn't matter what everybody was talking
[1:12:46] about dates and times and seasons we had
[1:12:48] ministers meetings on
[1:12:50] the little thing in our colorado and
[1:12:52] what it was about to date so
[1:12:54] going up in the sky in the cloud and the
[1:12:56] thing like and i told them then i said
[1:12:57] you're denying the god that the prophet
[1:12:59] is the
[1:13:00] is the prophet of god for the age you're
[1:13:02] denying what he says
[1:13:05] you're just not arguing over dates and
[1:13:07] times you're trying to prove him wrong
[1:13:08] because if you can prove him wrong
[1:13:10] you're going to disbelieve him
[1:13:14] well you can see that back there i
[1:13:16] wasn't popular either
[1:13:18] so that's why i'm not popular now
[1:13:19] because i stand on one thing
[1:13:21] it's this message or nothing
[1:13:25] we're either going up or we're going
[1:13:26] down
[1:13:28] we got our choice
[1:13:31] let's take our choice our stand you know
[1:13:34] god might
[1:13:34] decide to look down and say hey them
[1:13:36] people's doing just what i want them to
[1:13:38] do
[1:13:41] and you know when he does he's going to
[1:13:42] move on the scene
[1:13:47] with a pity padded little baby you know
[1:13:52] no that's not what he wants
[1:13:56] he wants his bride to stand forth and be
[1:13:59] men and women
[1:14:00] of the gospel
[1:14:03] like i said you may not even think it
[1:14:04] means a thing in the world but see i
[1:14:06] like that kind of a doing
[1:14:08] to worry that i can say hey look this is
[1:14:10] not this scripture here
[1:14:12] is not the engrafting of the gentiles
[1:14:15] because they don't even mention them in
[1:14:16] ephesians you know in this scripture
[1:14:18] ephesians 1.
[1:14:21] so i give you the scripture that says
[1:14:22] hey
[1:14:24] here's the other scriptures about the
[1:14:26] gentiles you think well what does that
[1:14:28] mean to me
[1:14:28] someday somebody will come up to you and
[1:14:30] say something and you'll say
[1:14:32] ephesians 1 is not the engrafting of the
[1:14:35] gentiles and you're going to blow their
[1:14:37] brain
[1:14:39] because they've been taught of
[1:14:40] engrafting
[1:14:43] and they taught it as a whole thing it's
[1:14:45] not
[1:14:46] engrafting gets in you to the body of
[1:14:48] christ
[1:14:50] come on in grafting just puts you in the
[1:14:53] body of christ that don't put you to
[1:14:55] adoption
[1:14:57] growth development of a child eating and
[1:15:00] and drinking milk and
[1:15:01] and all i got it's what causes a child
[1:15:03] to grow up
[1:15:05] in the gospel by eating the word of god
[1:15:07] week in week out
[1:15:09] day in and day out hearing the same
[1:15:11] thing well brother dale you said that
[1:15:13] five times this week
[1:15:14] if we're gonna have five more services
[1:15:16] i'd say it five or ten more times
[1:15:18] why because one thing
[1:15:22] repetitive points is going to put it in
[1:15:24] your mind
[1:15:28] and you may need it someday
[1:15:34] because i believe somebody is going to
[1:15:37] come to a place
[1:15:38] to call god on the scene
[1:15:42] i believe he's going to come because of
[1:15:44] what they've done with the word
[1:15:47] he come to abraham because abraham
[1:15:49] believed him
[1:15:55] what about me and you
[1:15:59] but you see one thing in ending it
[1:16:04] whatever we he saw of us
[1:16:07] back there before the world
[1:16:11] is what we're going to do now
[1:16:16] there's no way for him back there to see
[1:16:19] you as a saved person
[1:16:23] and then see you come over here in
[1:16:24] reality find out
[1:16:26] and join a church and go to church and
[1:16:28] cry and please
[1:16:29] and get saved because you're not going
[1:16:31] to do it because he doesn't see you
[1:16:32] ain't going to do it he's seen that
[1:16:34] something wrong
[1:16:35] will be something wrong with you and
[1:16:36] you're not going to do it
[1:16:38] so we better be praying for god to try
[1:16:40] to match our predestination
[1:16:42] with our foreknowledge
[1:16:48] and to cry out before him and say lord
[1:16:50] whatever i was back there i
[1:16:52] am that now let me go that away
[1:16:57] amen you can't change your
[1:16:58] predestination
[1:17:00] do you understand
[1:17:03] the man that was at it 15 years he never
[1:17:06] trained it he died
[1:17:08] the prophet told him you're going to die
[1:17:14] he begged for god and god gave him 15
[1:17:16] years god didn't change his mind he died
[1:17:18] in 15 years
[1:17:20] he'd have been better off though if he'd
[1:17:21] have died right there because he messed
[1:17:23] up in his 15 years that he was left
[1:17:27] you see we crying praying and you know
[1:17:29] and doing our little baby ways
[1:17:31] but brother dale i know when i was there
[1:17:34] i was there when i
[1:17:35] received the holy ghost because i
[1:17:36] shouted and spoke in tongues and
[1:17:38] and i done this and i done that i saw
[1:17:40] dreams i had visions
[1:17:42] amen for all of us but what about the
[1:17:44] word
[1:17:49] are you going to turn the word down see
[1:17:51] that's what god would see you do before
[1:17:53] the world
[1:17:53] he'd see you crying and praying and
[1:17:56] everything
[1:18:00] but you see you turn down the word of
[1:18:02] the hour
[1:18:04] you realize what these brothers are
[1:18:06] doing now when they're killing these
[1:18:08] the people of the message by their
[1:18:10] self-interpretations of all of the
[1:18:12] things
[1:18:16] they are destroying
[1:18:19] the people's opportunity
[1:18:24] be careful what you hear don't let it
[1:18:28] become a part of you
[1:18:32] don't let it become a part of you
[1:18:34] because it's hard to get rid of
[1:18:38] the hardest thing to get rid of is a
[1:18:39] false doctrine
[1:18:41] because you're going to do everything
[1:18:43] that you can that's why i always say
[1:18:46] i don't have to worry about you if
[1:18:48] you'll spend as much time
[1:18:51] trying to prove that what i've said to
[1:18:53] you is right
[1:18:54] if you do spend that much time trying to
[1:18:57] prove that i'm wrong
[1:18:58] if you'll try to prove that i'm right
[1:19:00] you'll see what i'm talking about
[1:19:03] so it's left into your life a
[1:19:06] predestinated plan a destiny
[1:19:08] is set for a group of people
[1:19:11] to reach an adoption opposition to where
[1:19:14] that she can come to romans 8. we'll get
[1:19:16] over to our right
[1:19:17] you remember in romans 8 what it does it
[1:19:19] comes down to wit
[1:19:21] to understand to wit the redemption of
[1:19:24] the body
[1:19:26] to understand the redemption of the body
[1:19:28] and what it takes to be there
[1:19:31] that was your adoption
[1:19:35] yeah but do i have to know everything
[1:19:36] not they
[1:19:39] you don't have to know everything i know
[1:19:42] and i don't mean that wrong
[1:19:43] because i believe you know more than i
[1:19:44] do because you can you can study on
[1:19:46] whatever you want to you can listen to
[1:19:47] any tape you want to
[1:19:50] i listened to my wife we'll do something
[1:19:52] we'll be there and maybe sometimes two
[1:19:54] or three tapes run right through
[1:19:55] listening
[1:20:00] i ain't saying that i'm about to mourn
[1:20:02] her more than me i'm just saying the
[1:20:04] point
[1:20:06] one of us might be sitting there of
[1:20:09] eating and
[1:20:09] and filling up on the word of god for
[1:20:12] whatever we have another
[1:20:13] and the other one's sitting there
[1:20:14] listening a good message
[1:20:18] right
[1:20:23] make your calling and say this morning
[1:20:25] calling an election sure
[1:20:27] come on musician make your calling an
[1:20:30] election sure
[1:20:33] make sure that you know what it is to be
[1:20:36] called
[1:20:38] make sure you know what it is to be
[1:20:41] elected
[1:20:44] but just remember all of that is covered
[1:20:47] under one thing if you'll remember
[1:20:48] the foreknowledge of god
[1:20:53] the foreknowledge of god
[1:20:58] he knew before the world what all of us
[1:21:00] would do
[1:21:02] and we're not going to change it you say
[1:21:04] well ain't no need of me trying then
[1:21:06] well he saw that
[1:21:10] if you say well is there any hopes of me
[1:21:12] changing my life
[1:21:13] and becoming a christian yeah
[1:21:17] if you'll do what god says
[1:21:20] well that's changing his mind no it
[1:21:22] didn't he knew he was going to change
[1:21:25] he knew he was going to come to a place
[1:21:26] that's what i've been talking about he
[1:21:28] knew you'd come to a place to want to be
[1:21:30] saved
[1:21:30] so he'll have it for you
[1:21:36] i don't see how anything of salvation
[1:21:38] could be any more simple
[1:21:41] than to understand that god before the
[1:21:44] world ever begun
[1:21:45] saw what we would do and he had it
[1:21:47] waiting on us when we got here
[1:21:55] how much more simple can you do that
[1:21:57] unless stan what we got brother
[1:22:01] that that sounds like home to me
[1:22:06] think on these things that sounds
[1:22:10] like home to me
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:14] like where i want to be
[1:22:20] there'll be no tears
[1:22:30] [Music]

[1:22:36] with the story
[1:22:40] as we sing of his grace and glory
[1:22:46] where the saints of god will be
[1:22:52] that sounds like home to me
[1:22:59] that sounds like home to me
[1:23:05] right where i want to be
[1:23:11] there'll be no tears
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:31] and then we're going to send one for her
[1:23:33] to hide
[1:23:34] because i believe in it i believe in
[1:23:37] that being there and i'll take care of
