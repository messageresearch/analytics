[17:28] morning
[17:31] let's just go straight into the word
[17:33] and uh
[17:34] just ask the lord to bless the reading
[17:36] of the word
[17:38] oh god we're so grateful to be able to
[17:39] gather together lord
[17:41] lord as we look into your word with
[17:43] confidence of what we believe and what
[17:44] we're standing here for lord jesus
[17:46] and we just pray lord that this
[17:48] morning's gathering will not be in vain
[17:49] lord god because lord we know lord we're
[17:52] not just gathering together to look at
[17:53] one another lord but we're here lord to
[17:55] receive something from you
[17:57] to know you more lord jesus in the power
[17:59] of your resurrection
[18:00] and we thank you god for all that you've
[18:03] given unto us lord jesus for your
[18:04] presence lord is already moving through
[18:07] the building
[18:09] lord there's many needs this morning
[18:11] lord jesus and we know lord that you're
[18:13] here to meet every need
[18:15] no matter what it is lord whether it's
[18:17] healing or salvation or a refilling lord
[18:20] jesus
[18:22] and i pray god that you feel at liberty
[18:24] this morning to move through the place
[18:26] and to quicken every heart that's in
[18:27] need lord jesus
[18:30] we ask your blessing of the reading of
[18:31] the word
[18:35] so psalm chapter 103 says
[18:38] i'm just gonna this is a scripture that
[18:40] you know we we we preach a lot about
[18:43] when we're when we're preaching but i'm
[18:44] just going to take this as my main text
[18:46] this morning and
[18:48] and sure enjoyed that sunday school
[18:50] lesson and
[18:51] and all of the singing
[18:57] and we certainly welcome our our
[18:58] visiting brother here uh we just i'll
[19:00] say like brother dale always says we you
[19:02] know you you come the first time and
[19:04] you're uh we welcome and you come you
[19:06] come the second time you're just part of
[19:07] us because we don't have nothing to
[19:09] nothing to join or not nothing to sign
[19:11] our name on or shake hands with or
[19:13] anything like that we're just born into
[19:14] the body
[19:17] so psalms chapter 103 says a psalm of
[19:19] david bless the lord o my soul and all
[19:21] that is within me bless his holy name
[19:24] bless the lord o my soul
[19:27] and forget not all his benefits
[19:29] we've got a lot of benefits that we can
[19:31] take advantage of
[19:33] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[19:37] who healeth all our diseases
[19:40] the lord at his blessing to the word
[19:42] this morning he may be seated
[19:47] so i want to just uh
[19:49] you know since uh i we're i'm taking
[19:52] both services today i i just want to
[19:54] speak on today this morning this
[19:56] afternoon about how that i believe we've
[19:58] got satan's answer
[20:00] and you know in this hour there's the
[20:02] you know you you come into church this
[20:04] morning and and as the songs are showing
[20:06] you can definitely feel the the presence
[20:09] of
[20:10] something beyond yourself and you know
[20:12] you just because you can feel something
[20:15] there's something that's real
[20:18] there's something that
[20:20] brother graham said it gives an unction
[20:22] to the preacher that that moves through
[20:24] the through the to the building that can
[20:26] give power to a christian to live a life
[20:29] that you couldn't live before you were
[20:30] saved and there's something that's real
[20:33] so we know that the presence of you know
[20:35] you should know just by coming into
[20:36] church this morning that there's a
[20:37] there's a real god
[20:45] but you know there's also there's also a
[20:47] devil and and there's and we believe
[20:49] that there's a real devil and the devil
[20:51] moves moves through situations and he's
[20:54] trying to try to take control of your
[20:56] life and try to change the direction of
[20:58] your life he'll try to change the
[21:00] direction of your your family or your
[21:02] your
[21:02] an individual or the church even and try
[21:05] to get people's minds going in a
[21:06] different direction but yet we we we've
[21:09] got you you can't you can't uh there's
[21:12] no way to defeat satan of your own
[21:14] abilities there's no way to defeat satan
[21:15] of your own
[21:17] with with your own doings or your own
[21:18] works or anything but
[21:20] there's one way that we can defeat satan
[21:22] and that's through god's word
[21:24] and and i believe that we've got satan's
[21:26] answer i believe that we've got an
[21:27] answer to nobody no matter what the
[21:29] devil throws at you whether he throws
[21:31] sickness at you whether he throws a mind
[21:33] battle at you a torment of of of your
[21:35] spirit whatever it is that we've got his
[21:37] answer
[21:38] and as we read here in psalms chapter
[21:40] 103 it says what what a great comfort
[21:43] and a blessing it is to look into god's
[21:44] word and see the privilege that he's
[21:46] given to us that when we go through
[21:48] rough times and we go through rough
[21:49] spots in our life that we can look and
[21:51] gain confidence in his word that to
[21:53] remember that that
[21:55] to remember the benefits that god has
[21:58] given to us
[21:59] bless the lord o my soul and for getting
[22:01] out all his benefits who forgive us all
[22:03] thy iniquities who healeth all thy
[22:05] diseases
[22:07] now i want you to notice there that it
[22:08] was in all
[22:10] it it's not saying sometimes part of the
[22:12] way or anything it's it's it's an
[22:14] all-inclusive package and that means if
[22:16] you've committed any sins or if you've
[22:18] committed any antiquities then you're at
[22:19] the right place to have all your
[22:22] iniquities wiped away to have all your
[22:24] sin wiped away to have the slate
[22:27] completely cleared and that goes the
[22:29] same way for healing if you've got a
[22:30] problem in your body a problem in your
[22:33] spirit or whatever it is if you need
[22:35] healing in your soul this is the right
[22:37] place to come if you need healing in
[22:39] your body this is the right place to
[22:41] come
[22:43] and i want to say you know and and maybe
[22:45] that will say that
[22:46] the the religious world of today there's
[22:48] a lot of people that have gotten away
[22:50] from believing that god still heals i
[22:52] believe that the bible says that he's
[22:54] hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday
[22:57] today and forever so if he healed
[22:59] somebody in the old testament he's the
[23:01] same today if he healed somebody when
[23:03] the apostles were preaching he's the
[23:04] same today as he was back then because
[23:07] you can't get away from hebrews 13 8
[23:09] that he's the same yesterday today and
[23:12] forever so we look many people will say
[23:14] well well god doesn't heal any people
[23:16] anymore he doesn't do miracles anymore
[23:18] but yet i believe because of that
[23:20] scripture and because of so many other
[23:22] testimonies through scripture and so
[23:24] many testimonies of christians lives
[23:26] down through the ages that he's still a
[23:28] miracle working god he's still able to
[23:31] heal
[23:32] now now we we co we we believe that god
[23:34] sent a prophet in this last day just
[23:36] like he sent uh he sent arenas and
[23:38] columba and and and and martin luther
[23:41] and and john wesley to the believers in
[23:43] those ages and now we believe that in
[23:45] this last stage that god sent a man
[23:48] named william branham to to to open up
[23:51] the things that a lot of people had
[23:52] probed at before like like for example
[23:54] that does god still do miracles
[23:57] and so a lot of things i'm going to be
[23:58] quoting this morning come from some of
[24:00] the things he say is like like this what
[24:01] that i will quote for you now no matter
[24:03] what you've done wrong
[24:05] god is here to forgive no matter what
[24:07] satan throws your way we've got the
[24:09] answer and and and so now satan what
[24:12] that means is satan does not have any
[24:14] legal rights this morning at all
[24:16] he don't have any legal why does he not
[24:18] have any legal rights because jesus
[24:20] christ on the cross
[24:22] died died to take away everything that
[24:24] the devil had done
[24:26] christ defeated him in our stead there
[24:28] at calvary and when he died he spoiled
[24:30] principalities and robbed satan of every
[24:34] power that he had now this morning i
[24:36] want to i think that should build up our
[24:38] faith and build up our confidence that
[24:40] if you've got a problem in your life
[24:42] jesus christ already paid he already
[24:44] paid the price for that on the cross and
[24:46] he robbed there he robbed satan there on
[24:49] the cross of every power that he could
[24:51] have over your life which is why in
[24:54] colossians chapter 2 verse 15 it says
[24:56] having spoiled principalities and powers
[24:59] he made a show of them openly he made a
[25:01] show there on the cross he made a show
[25:03] openly on the day of pentecost as they
[25:05] began to preach in the street
[25:07] proclaiming what christ had done he made
[25:09] a show openly when they told that that
[25:11] the lame man
[25:13] next to the gate beautiful right look
[25:15] look on us and we don't have any silver
[25:17] and gold but if you rise up and walk
[25:20] if you just believe rise up and walk and
[25:22] he made a show openly that that
[25:24] everything that the devil had had been
[25:27] yanked away from him
[25:29] made a show of them openly trying
[25:31] triumphing over them in it now see the
[25:34] church the church now has been
[25:36] commissioned we've got that commission
[25:38] that when the devil has control over
[25:40] somebody when the devil's tormenting
[25:41] somebody the church has been given this
[25:43] commission
[25:44] to deliberate somebody
[25:46] by the preaching of the gospel by laying
[25:49] hand on on hands to deliver somebody
[25:52] from these from from these torments the
[25:54] church has been commissioned to cast out
[25:56] devils in mark chapter 16 we read and he
[25:58] said unto them go ye into all the world
[26:00] and preach the gospel to every creature
[26:03] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[26:05] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[26:07] be damned and these signs shall follow
[26:09] them that believe in my name shall they
[26:11] cast out devils they shall speak with
[26:13] new tongues so you see we've got a
[26:15] commission we've got a commission to
[26:17] fulfill that jesus christ is the same
[26:19] yesterday today and forever we've been
[26:22] commissioned to cast out devils and you
[26:24] know this is this gospel that i'm
[26:25] preaching this morning is not
[26:27] sometimes we get in our mind that this
[26:29] is just a gospel for old people or a
[26:31] gospel for grandpa or something for old
[26:34] folks something for the people in the
[26:35] old folks home but this gospel is
[26:37] something for everybody you know daniel
[26:39] was a young man and josiah was a young
[26:41] man and and all you've got today david
[26:44] was a young man and this this gospel is
[26:46] for the old and for the young and for
[26:47] the infirm and for the weak and for the
[26:49] strong and the it's for everybody
[26:54] it doesn't matter who you are or what
[26:55] your situation in life is for is this
[26:58] morning whatever you are whether you're
[26:59] old or weak you can be loosed from the
[27:01] situation that you're in this morning
[27:04] what are you doing brother bob i'm
[27:05] preaching the gospel this morning the
[27:07] gospel was sent to loose those what they
[27:09] were bound the gospel they were sent to
[27:11] set you free from whatever torment the
[27:13] devil has in your life this morning
[27:18] because the gospel says in matthew
[27:20] chapter 18 it says verily i say unto you
[27:22] now these are the words of jesus christ
[27:24] to us the words of christ to us that
[27:26] we're supposed to be fulfilling now he
[27:28] said whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
[27:30] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[27:32] you shall loose on earth shall be loosed
[27:34] in heaven again i say unto you that if
[27:36] two of you now now think about what a
[27:38] great thing is if two of you if two holy
[27:41] ghosts feel believers in the church get
[27:43] together and they start thinking the
[27:45] same way and they start becoming an
[27:46] agreement that you know we don't have to
[27:48] take what the devil has put on us
[27:50] anymore we don't have to sit there and
[27:52] just accept the torment in our spirit we
[27:54] don't have to accept this broken body
[27:56] that i'm living in i don't have to
[27:57] accept it and you begin to lay hands
[27:59] upon one another and get into a spirit
[28:01] of agreement like they were in the upper
[28:03] room in one accord that something is
[28:05] going to happen
[28:07] he said again i say unto you that if two
[28:09] of you shall agree on earth as touching
[28:11] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[28:13] done for them of my father which is in
[28:15] heaven
[28:16] i believe this morning we can have come
[28:18] with confidence with with that kind of
[28:20] confidence that it's going to be done if
[28:22] you come believing what god has already
[28:24] said and these are not my words and
[28:26] these are not the words of any man but
[28:28] these are the words of christ that he
[28:30] spoke to the church that you don't have
[28:32] to settle to be tormented by the devil
[28:34] for where two or three are gathered
[28:36] together in my name there am i in the
[28:38] midst of them and i think we've seen the
[28:40] evidence of that scripture this morning
[28:42] as we've gathered and as we've sung the
[28:44] songs of praise and worship that christ
[28:46] has gathered together in our midst he's
[28:48] here and he's moving the angels of god
[28:51] and kept around them that fear him and
[28:53] we have a proof that god is with us
[28:56] now what is what is the devil
[28:59] what is the devil
[29:00] we know that god is here and we know
[29:03] that we know that the lord is here to
[29:05] fight our battles
[29:07] and we know that we have an answer for
[29:08] satan
[29:09] so what is satan
[29:12] you know when you beg when you can begin
[29:14] to understand what what what the devil
[29:16] is and what he's doing then you you
[29:18] begin to lose your fear of him you begin
[29:20] to realize that he's nothing but a bluff
[29:23] like brother ryan was said as the word
[29:25] as the picture becomes more clear this
[29:26] morning as he was speaking on the
[29:28] picture begins to unfold of what we're
[29:30] doing here what our purpose is and you
[29:31] begin to understand by revelation
[29:34] because you begin revelation is what
[29:36] gives you gives you the ability to to go
[29:38] up against the devil
[29:40] he said a devil
[29:42] a demon now listen a demon devil all
[29:44] comes from one word and in the english
[29:46] it's called
[29:47] tormentor
[29:49] tormentor that's what the devil is if
[29:51] you think about maybe maybe this morning
[29:53] you're tormented in your mind maybe
[29:54] you're wondering maybe you're wondering
[29:56] can i can i be forgiven can i be saved
[29:58] maybe you're wondering maybe maybe
[30:00] you're born again and you're you're in
[30:01] your spirit the devil's been putting all
[30:03] kinds of lies and things about whether
[30:05] maybe you're backslidden and you're
[30:06] going you're going back you you've
[30:08] forgotten what your purpose is in life
[30:11] and and you're you're turning off the
[30:13] off the way and and you begin to wonder
[30:15] is there any hope for me have i gone too
[30:17] far
[30:18] and that's what the devil's job is the
[30:20] devil is his job is to torment you and
[30:22] plague your mind and plague plague your
[30:24] thoughts and make you think somebody's
[30:26] talking about you behind your back or
[30:28] make you think somebody doesn't like you
[30:29] and it's constantly a torment but yet
[30:32] there is a relief from that that's what
[30:33] the holy ghost was given to come into
[30:36] the church to relieve you from the
[30:37] torment that's to come into the church
[30:39] and give you a rest that's what that
[30:41] rest is that jesus jesus talked about i
[30:44] will give you a rest come unto me all
[30:46] you that labor and are heavy laden and
[30:48] i'll give you a rest a rest that the
[30:50] world can't give the alcohol and the
[30:52] drugs and all that can't give you a rest
[30:54] but he'll give you a rest that only he
[30:56] can give
[30:57] and that demon
[30:58] that demon will come in if you're not
[31:00] born again he can come into your soul
[31:02] and torment your soul a tormentor is a a
[31:05] torment even in the natural it's a
[31:07] person who inflicts severe mental or
[31:09] physical suffering on somebody
[31:11] i was thinking about if you read in
[31:13] history about fox's book of martyrs how
[31:15] the how they
[31:16] they would torment the catholic church
[31:18] with torment people that believed
[31:19] different with them and they would they
[31:21] would they would put them on a rack and
[31:22] stretch them and i began to read all
[31:24] these stories about how one man
[31:27] he was out on a rack and and and he was
[31:30] being his they had him on that rack
[31:32] where he was being stretched and he
[31:33] looked and all of a sudden next to him
[31:34] appeared an angel and it began to wipe
[31:37] his brows he was being stretched on that
[31:38] rack because he was being tormented
[31:41] there was a a physical a person there
[31:43] that was put put him on that rack and
[31:44] they had all these devices you think
[31:46] about what could what could make a man
[31:48] torment somebody else
[31:49] what could make somebody want to torment
[31:51] their brother their their natural
[31:53] brother what could makes what
[31:55] only the devil because that's the the
[31:56] devil is the tormentor a devil is
[31:59] something that will make somebody make
[32:01] somebody feel miserable and brother adam
[32:03] said many times you see a person maybe
[32:05] of insanity they may maybe even a
[32:07] converted person feel with the holy
[32:09] spirit and yet be totally insane he said
[32:12] that's got nothing to do with the soul
[32:14] it's a tormentor see something that
[32:15] torments them what a strange thing that
[32:18] you could be born again but tormented in
[32:20] your spirit and plagued by something
[32:22] that's tormented in your body tormented
[32:24] tormented because that's what the devil
[32:26] does
[32:27] torment of the spirit what is that does
[32:29] god love me you begin to think that
[32:30] maybe god don't love you anymore that's
[32:32] why you got to come to church because
[32:35] church is where you get proved that god
[32:36] still loves you because he'll speak to
[32:38] you he'll speak to words of life from
[32:40] behind the pulpit something something
[32:42] that you have need of and it'll go out
[32:44] and begin to speak words of comfort and
[32:46] ones of joy and peace
[32:48] and you'll know that god still cares you
[32:50] begin to wonder god does god still care
[32:52] about me does anybody ever care
[32:55] is there any hope and you begin to maybe
[32:56] get into a place of of maybe where you
[32:58] where you're wondering should i kill
[33:00] myself is is all hope lost
[33:02] the devil is a tormentor brother branham
[33:04] said he's here to tear up your body
[33:07] to eat you up to destroy you shorten
[33:10] your three score and ten if you can but
[33:12] you know i believe this morning that
[33:13] we've got an answer for all that torment
[33:15] we've got an answer and that answer is
[33:17] jesus christ that answer is the baptism
[33:20] of the holy ghost that answer is his
[33:22] word
[33:26] you know the bible even says that we're
[33:28] supposed to be ready to give an answer
[33:30] it's first peter 3 15 it says sanctify
[33:32] the lord god in your hearts and be ready
[33:34] always
[33:35] to give an answer to give an answer to
[33:37] every man that asks you a reason of the
[33:39] hope that is in you with meekness and
[33:40] fear and what is the reason of the hope
[33:43] that what is the answer the answer that
[33:45] we can give when somebody asks us why do
[33:46] you dress that way because i believe
[33:48] jesus christ because i've been
[33:50] transformed by from the old way that i
[33:52] was living for the world into a new
[33:54] creation why do you talk the way that
[33:57] you do why do you talk with comfort and
[33:59] joy why do you talk with faith believing
[34:01] that no matter what the devil throws at
[34:03] me yet there's there's something real
[34:05] that i believe
[34:06] no matter what sickness i have in my
[34:08] life yet i know that god is still a
[34:10] healer
[34:11] brother adam said we as human beings
[34:13] have no power against the devil
[34:16] so we don't come to meet him in the name
[34:17] of a church or an organization but satan
[34:20] is defeated he is defeated and we come
[34:23] to meet him in the name of our conqueror
[34:25] jesus christ we come to meet him in that
[34:27] name now think about
[34:31] the devil the devil could torment the
[34:33] devil could torment a believer the devil
[34:36] will come and torment
[34:39] but he can't make one move
[34:42] he can't make one move unless he's
[34:43] permitted to do so
[34:46] you think about job when
[34:47] satan answered the lord and said does
[34:49] job fear god for naught
[34:51] do they fear does he fear god for
[34:53] knowing how not made him hedge about him
[34:55] and about his house and about all that
[34:57] he hath on every side thou hast blessed
[34:59] the work of his hands and his substances
[35:01] increased in the land
[35:04] god the devil could not do one thing
[35:06] to job unless god allowed it he couldn't
[35:10] do one thing to him
[35:11] when when jesus was standing there in
[35:13] front of pilate he said the al qaedas
[35:15] have no power at all
[35:16] against me except it were given thee
[35:18] from above
[35:20] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[35:22] hath the greater sin that pilate could
[35:24] not do one thing to jesus unless it was
[35:26] allowed and you see god sometimes he
[35:28] will he will pull back the protection
[35:30] let's let's understand this this morning
[35:33] i believe this will give us confidence a
[35:34] confidence that we're living life for a
[35:36] purpose there's a reason sometimes why
[35:39] things happen to us there's a reason
[35:41] sometimes why god allows us to get sick
[35:44] because there's a purpose in our life
[35:45] and sometimes god will roll back that
[35:48] hedge of protection why did you roll it
[35:50] back from job's case to prove to the
[35:52] devil that somebody was going to stand
[35:54] for god sometimes sometimes you know
[35:57] that's what even sometimes that might be
[35:59] what happened is happening in your life
[36:00] you'll go through a little rough spot
[36:02] maybe think about this maybe god is
[36:04] standing back boasting to the devil i i
[36:07] don't care what you do
[36:08] that person is not going to believe and
[36:10] you know in this day god is going to
[36:12] have a bride that will not do like eve
[36:15] but she will stand for the word no
[36:17] matter what it doesn't matter what comes
[36:19] her way she is going to she's going to
[36:22] not not to be one word off so there is a
[36:24] purpose to what god allows god knows if
[36:28] you are sick god knows if you're needy
[36:31] he knows he is not oblivious he know
[36:34] he's he's a he we have a high priest
[36:36] that is touched by the feelings of our
[36:38] infirmities and he know he knows even
[36:40] before you ask it
[36:42] maybe he maybe he just wants to prove to
[36:44] the devil that you you're going to
[36:45] believe god anyhow or
[36:47] maybe he's trying to get you to a place
[36:50] of repentance a place where you begin to
[36:52] realize that you need god he's trying to
[36:54] maybe get trying to get you to a place
[36:56] where you begin to understand what your
[36:58] need is maybe he's getting you allowing
[37:01] the devil to maybe get you to a place of
[37:03] middle anguish to drive you to your
[37:05] knees to begin to get in your back
[37:08] closet and begin to call out to god get
[37:10] down beside your bed at night and begin
[37:12] to pray to god and say you know what i'm
[37:14] tired of the way that i've been living
[37:16] i'm tired of the way that i've been
[37:18] walking maybe you begin to get weak so
[37:20] that you can be conscious of your
[37:22] frailty maybe you you begin to get sick
[37:24] so that you're reminded that your days
[37:26] on earth are few you know sometimes you
[37:28] get a flu and you begin to be more
[37:30] conscious of you know one of these days
[37:33] i'm i if something don't happen i'm
[37:35] going to go down in the grave you begin
[37:37] to get real sick and you begin to get
[37:38] consciousness everything you know
[37:41] some something's different
[37:43] and it begins to give you a
[37:45] consciousness that you need something
[37:47] you need god and yeah but see everything
[37:50] everything is working toward a purpose
[37:52] and romans chapter 8 it says and we know
[37:54] that all things work together
[37:57] we know all things work together
[38:00] everything can you say that this morning
[38:01] that you know that everything that
[38:04] happens to you
[38:05] works it works for a purpose
[38:08] we know all things work together for
[38:09] according to for good to them that love
[38:12] god
[38:13] to them who are the called according to
[38:15] his purpose
[38:17] now you can't say that now at least
[38:19] you're really confident that you love
[38:21] god
[38:22] that he's called you that he foreknew
[38:24] you you know
[38:26] people out there in the hockey tank
[38:27] don't can't say that you know the people
[38:30] out there doing living living living for
[38:32] the world they can't say that well i
[38:33] know everything's working the good to
[38:35] the good for for those are called
[38:36] according to his purpose but a christian
[38:39] can say that
[38:40] but and what is your purpose your
[38:41] purpose now the purpose is you're in
[38:44] romans chapter 8 it says for whom he did
[38:46] for know
[38:47] he also did predestinate
[38:49] to be conformed to the image of his son
[38:53] that he might be the firstborn among
[38:55] many brethren so we have a purpose this
[38:57] morning and your purpose is to be
[38:59] conformed to the image of his son
[39:02] to be conformed to that means to be
[39:04] molded and to be changed until you're
[39:06] just like jesus
[39:08] until you can walk like jesus and talk
[39:11] like jesus until until the devil can
[39:13] come to you like he did jesus as he and
[39:16] his as he went into the wilderness and
[39:17] throw all those different temptations in
[39:19] front of him why don't you make bread
[39:21] why don't you go up high on on a
[39:23] building why don't you make something
[39:24] big of yourself why don't you go after
[39:26] popularity or won't why don't you go
[39:28] after money and you can come to a place
[39:30] where you're cut so conformed to the
[39:33] image that's what the bible says conform
[39:35] to the image of his son until the devil
[39:38] can't do nothing with you so what is
[39:40] your purpose in life that's why that's
[39:42] why things happen to you that's why you
[39:44] get sick sometimes it's to bring because
[39:46] there's a purpose being fulfilled in
[39:48] your life there's a purpose you have a
[39:50] purpose and your purpose is not to have
[39:52] a lot of money
[39:55] and not have to work
[39:56] your purpose is not to be able to play
[39:58] video games all day
[40:00] your purpose is not to be respected in
[40:02] the community
[40:03] those things are good sometimes
[40:06] to be respectful
[40:08] your purpose is not to retire early
[40:10] although that would be wonderful
[40:12] that would be wonderful to be able to
[40:14] retire early and sit home in my easy
[40:16] chair
[40:17] and your purpose is not to be successful
[40:19] on your own terms
[40:21] your purpose
[40:22] is to be conformed to the image of his
[40:24] son
[40:25] to be conformed you know what that means
[40:27] despite all the hardships you may that i
[40:30] believe that would change that should
[40:31] change our mindset to where we're almost
[40:34] more willing to go through suffering and
[40:36] hard times to be conformed to the image
[40:40] of his son because that's what his
[40:41] purpose is in our life to be conformed
[40:43] into the image of jesus christ to be
[40:46] conformed into the image where where
[40:48] you've got these virtues that you've got
[40:50] the virtue of life the actual life of
[40:52] christ living in you the knowledge where
[40:54] you know that he's the same yesterday
[40:56] today and forever whether you've got the
[40:58] same kind of temperance where god is in
[41:00] control of your life where you've got
[41:02] patience to deal with one another and
[41:04] patience to wait on god where you could
[41:06] wait like abraham did if it takes 25
[41:09] years you can wait because you know he's
[41:11] hebrews 13 8 and you've got godliness to
[41:14] act like god even knowing that if if
[41:16] you've got to endure trials and
[41:18] tribulations yet god is working a
[41:20] purpose in your life and that makes you
[41:23] like god and brotherly kindness to give
[41:25] grace to one another
[41:28] and not hold things over one another's
[41:29] head because that's what your purpose is
[41:34] maybe maybe this morning i pray that
[41:36] that would give liberty to some of us to
[41:38] know that whatever things you're going
[41:40] through in life
[41:41] that you've got a purpose and if you
[41:43] love god and god loves you everything in
[41:45] life is working toward that purpose if
[41:48] you love god and god loves you
[41:50] if you're walking in his word
[41:52] everything is working toward that
[41:54] purpose
[41:55] but now god is god is not the author of
[41:57] sickness
[41:58] what what are you i'm preaching on
[41:59] sickness this morning
[42:01] sometimes we forget that god is a healer
[42:03] god is still a healer
[42:07] god didn't author sickness though
[42:09] sickness came from the devil we're
[42:10] talking about how that sometimes god
[42:12] will back off and let things happen to
[42:14] you happen in your life but god is not
[42:16] the one that's that authored that
[42:18] sickness he'll back off and let things
[42:19] happen to you to bring you to a place of
[42:22] repentance to bring you to a place where
[42:23] you realize that you need something for
[42:25] god but god is not the author of that
[42:27] sickness
[42:28] you say well how could this is what some
[42:30] of some of the atheists think how how
[42:32] could a god how could a good god stand
[42:34] by and watch somebody pull out a gun in
[42:36] school and shoot somebody
[42:38] how could a good god stand by and let
[42:41] let somebody get sick how could a good
[42:43] god let let stand by and let the
[42:46] holocaust happen how could a good god
[42:48] let that happen
[42:50] well let's take the school shooting how
[42:52] could a good god stand by and let
[42:54] somebody pull a gun out in school and
[42:56] shoot up a lot of youth
[43:01] because god will not override your free
[43:03] moral agency
[43:05] you do you realize let's think about
[43:07] that now
[43:08] you cannot properly express love
[43:11] unless you have free will
[43:14] you cannot express how could god stand
[43:17] by and let adam and eve make the wrong
[43:19] choice
[43:20] and
[43:21] kill the whole earth get everything out
[43:23] of kilter how could he stand by and do
[43:26] that because he wants you to make a
[43:28] choice and if you don't have the right
[43:30] to make a choice then love cannot be
[43:33] expressed
[43:34] well think about your wife if you forced
[43:37] your wife or your spouse to marry you
[43:39] love could not be expressed because you
[43:41] cannot express love if you're forcing
[43:43] somebody
[43:44] even this morning you know as i look out
[43:46] on the on the christian world and his
[43:48] own situations that i i know about i
[43:50] wish that i could force somebody to walk
[43:53] different or do different but i can't
[43:54] force and know because love cannot be
[43:57] expressed if you force you've got to
[44:00] have the ability to respond
[44:02] that man that man maybe that would pull
[44:04] a gun out in a school and begin to shoot
[44:06] things up it it's his choice you see how
[44:09] god allows us to choose he wants you to
[44:12] choose life and this morning you've got
[44:14] the ability to either choose life or
[44:16] death you've got the ability to choose
[44:19] and it's not because a minister forced
[44:21] you to raise your hand or forced you to
[44:23] come to the altar or forced you to open
[44:25] up your heart and give your life to god
[44:27] but it's because you did it because you
[44:29] responded to god when you felt that
[44:32] little pulse sitting in your hearts that
[44:34] god drawing you because the bible says
[44:36] that no man can come to me except the
[44:38] father draw him and when the father
[44:40] begins to draw you and move you because
[44:42] you heard the word it's you responding
[44:44] it's not because somebody grabbed you by
[44:46] the nape of the neck and dragged you up
[44:48] to the altar but you responded
[44:53] love cannot be expressed without free
[44:55] will you remember brother brown telling
[44:57] that story about his son was out in the
[44:59] world playing cards and and
[45:01] and doing drinking alcohol and doing
[45:03] things he shouldn't and billy paul and
[45:05] and then he began to come back in church
[45:06] and he was sitting there on the pew and
[45:08] people began to come to the altar and
[45:10] this
[45:11] the spirit was moving through the church
[45:13] and and billy paul didn't respond maybe
[45:15] he was thinking i i maybe i should go up
[45:17] there and the old deacon in the church
[45:19] came up and tapped him on the shoulder
[45:21] and said shouldn't you go up there and
[45:23] brother brown later admonished that
[45:25] deacon why did he admonish the deacon
[45:28] because you can't force
[45:30] it's got to be your choice you can't
[45:32] grab somebody and you think sometimes
[45:33] about how how we raise our children you
[45:35] can't force your kids you can't force
[45:37] your kids to love going to church
[45:39] we've got to back off and let them make
[45:42] their own choice you remember that story
[45:44] brother i'm told about how that moses
[45:46] parents that they came to a place where
[45:48] they knew that they if they held on to
[45:50] moses that he was gonna die
[45:52] but they they came to a place where they
[45:54] had they knew they had to turn him over
[45:56] to god and put him in the bull rush and
[45:58] just watch him watch him sail away
[46:00] through all the hippos and all the all
[46:02] the all the animals all the anacondas
[46:04] whatever wild beasts were out there and
[46:06] they knew that god was going to protect
[46:09] him you know sometimes we've got to do
[46:11] that we got to take a step back and send
[46:13] let our kids go to the youth camp so
[46:15] that we're out of the way let's take a
[46:16] step back and let god begin to do
[46:18] something and i believe god is still
[46:20] able to do something i believe god is
[46:22] able to do more than abundantly anything
[46:24] we could all do by our own for centered
[46:26] by our own our own abilities it's god
[46:29] when god's hand is in it god is gonna
[46:32] make it all work out right
[46:35] and what a blessing it is when it's when
[46:37] it's your choice and not somebody else's
[46:39] when you're the one that said i want god
[46:42] and not because somebody else said you
[46:44] got to do it do you raise your hand not
[46:46] because somebody said you need to raise
[46:48] your hand or you say say amen not
[46:50] because somebody said you need to say
[46:51] amen but because something on the inside
[46:54] compels you i believe that and i want
[46:57] myself to be identified with that
[47:00] you know i was reading a sermon the
[47:02] other day where brother brown was
[47:03] telling the people in his congregation
[47:04] he was he was testifying about something
[47:06] that happened and he said now i want you
[47:08] to say amen say amen and they said amen
[47:12] and he said the reason i wanted you to
[47:13] say amen was because when people listen
[47:16] to this sermon your voice is going to be
[47:19] a testimony that the things that i said
[47:21] were true and every time you listen to
[47:23] that tape it echoes back so you see when
[47:26] you say amen it's a testimony that the
[47:28] things that are being said are correct
[47:31] that they're accurate that the thing
[47:32] that you agree with what's being said
[47:34] and even as people are listening in
[47:36] online they hear your voice saying amen
[47:39] because you believe that and you you're
[47:40] actually part of the service you're part
[47:42] of the experience because you're
[47:44] responding that you agree with what's
[47:46] being preached
[47:53] what a blessing that god doesn't want
[47:54] puppets in the church
[47:56] he wants you to choose he wants you to
[47:58] be able to respond he don't want you to
[48:00] just be tied by puppet strings so that
[48:02] he can just manipulate you or something
[48:04] it's got to be by your own free will you
[48:06] know even looking through this church
[48:07] we've got technicians and musicians and
[48:09] janitors and cooks and helps and they're
[48:12] all motivated not because somebody said
[48:14] you got to be a musician or you got to
[48:17] be a technician but something motivated
[48:19] them that they wanted to do that and
[48:21] they chose they chose to do that they
[48:23] volunteered to do it i want to be this
[48:26] part
[48:27] because why because it's impossible to
[48:30] love without the ability to choose and
[48:32] if the people even in this church are
[48:34] doing things because they love god
[48:36] not because they're forced but because
[48:38] they love god and that's what power is a
[48:41] christian life is love something changed
[48:43] in your heart and you love god that's
[48:45] the way you the reason you dress
[48:47] different that's the reason you don't
[48:49] drink alcohol and things like the world
[48:50] because you love god something in your
[48:53] heart has been changed
[48:55] god is a gentleman he'll never force you
[48:58] he won't force you
[49:01] but you know
[49:02] we got a purpose in our life that we're
[49:04] supposed to be fulfilling
[49:05] and that purpose is to be conformed to
[49:07] the image of god
[49:09] and sometimes we get a little out of
[49:10] line and we forget what our purpose is
[49:13] we get spiritual amnesia
[49:15] we forget what we're doing here and
[49:17] sometimes god has to pull that hedge of
[49:19] protection back
[49:21] so that we get a little reminder
[49:23] we need god
[49:25] sickness can be a tool that god allows
[49:27] you to bring to bring you to place of
[49:29] decision what to further his purpose
[49:32] now i'm echoing the things that brother
[49:34] branham said this today i'm if you want
[49:36] to go back and do some more studying i'm
[49:38] preaching from the sermons demonology
[49:40] physical realm and spiritual realm this
[49:42] morning this demonology physical realm
[49:44] so god sometimes permits satan these are
[49:46] brother ryan's words god sometimes
[49:48] permits satan to put sickness on you as
[49:51] a whip
[49:52] to bring you back to the house of god
[49:55] when you disobey him
[49:58] you think about that time again when
[50:00] billy paul was laying there he laying
[50:01] there in the hospital bread and he began
[50:04] to cry out for his daddy and his daddy
[50:05] said
[50:06] you do the you do that you did the sin
[50:08] and you do the praying
[50:10] cause because that was a tool that god
[50:12] was using a tool that god was using to
[50:15] bring him back to a place where he knew
[50:17] he needed god
[50:20] god permits trouble
[50:22] why so we'll get help
[50:26] you know even in your natural life
[50:28] when you get in trouble
[50:30] what's your first response i need some
[50:32] help
[50:33] when you get when you get stranded on
[50:34] the side of the road with a flat tire i
[50:36] got to get some help i got to call
[50:38] somebody i need some help if you're
[50:40] drowning who you're going to call you're
[50:41] going to look for a lifeguard are you
[50:42] going to call for your relative or
[50:44] something you're not just going to keep
[50:45] drowning if your back hurts you're going
[50:47] to go look for maybe a chiropractor or
[50:48] somebody that can help if your appendix
[50:50] ruptures whoop it's time to call the
[50:52] ambulance go to the emergency room you
[50:53] need some help if you're thirsty what
[50:55] are you gonna do you're gonna run to the
[50:56] kitchen and get you a glass of water
[50:58] you're not just gonna sit up there in
[50:59] your room and say well i'm thirsty i
[51:01] guess this is just the way it is but
[51:03] you're gonna run for that glass of water
[51:05] if you're hungry what are you gonna do
[51:07] you're gonna go run down to the kitchen
[51:08] and get you or the corner grocery store
[51:10] or the gas station and get you a little
[51:11] snack you're not just gonna sit there
[51:13] and stew in your condition but you're
[51:15] gonna go run to get to something
[51:17] something to satisfy that need if you're
[51:19] needy you gotta run to where you can get
[51:21] some help so if you're needed this
[51:23] morning don't sit there in your
[51:25] condition but run to the one who can
[51:27] meet every need
[51:29] and the bible says in philippians 4 19
[51:31] my god shall supply all your need
[51:34] according to his riches and glory by
[51:35] christ jesus in matthew 6 8 it says your
[51:38] father knoweth what things you have need
[51:39] of before you ask him and psalm 23 it
[51:42] says the lord is my shepherd i shall not
[51:45] want the lord is my shepherd so we've
[51:47] got somebody that will satisfy every
[51:49] need that knows what your need is this
[51:52] morning and that's got a purpose in your
[51:54] life so that everything in your life
[51:56] works according to that purpose so that
[51:58] that purpose can be fulfilled god knows
[52:01] what you need this morning in matthew 6
[52:03] 8 it says your father knoweth what
[52:05] things you have need of before you ask
[52:07] him
[52:08] in matthew chapter 6
[52:10] verse 25 it says therefore i say unto
[52:12] you take no thought for your life
[52:14] what you shall eat or what you shall
[52:16] drink nor yet for your body what you
[52:17] shall put on is not the life more than
[52:19] meat and the body than raiment behold
[52:21] the fowls of the air for they sow not
[52:23] knew that neither do they reap nor
[52:24] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[52:26] father feedeth them are you not much
[52:28] better than they
[52:30] and in jeremiah chapter 29 it says for i
[52:32] know the thoughts that i think toward
[52:34] you saith the lord thoughts of peace
[52:36] and not of evil to give you and expect
[52:39] it in
[52:40] then shall you call upon me and ye shall
[52:42] go and pray unto me and i will hearken
[52:44] unto you and ye shall seek me and find
[52:46] me when you shall search for me with all
[52:49] your heart
[52:50] so why do we get sick sometimes
[52:53] god wants your heart
[52:54] why do we go through trouble sometimes
[52:57] god wants your heart
[52:58] so if you're if you're sick and needy
[53:00] this morning if you're tormented by by
[53:02] something in your spirit where where you
[53:04] know you know that something's wrong in
[53:06] your life and you need something
[53:08] step one step one is make sure you're
[53:11] right with god
[53:13] make sure you're right your purpose is
[53:14] to be conformed to the image of his son
[53:16] so if you're out of step first step is
[53:18] is get along with god and say god i'm
[53:21] sorry for all the things i've done
[53:23] go go around to all the people that
[53:24] you've wronged and make things right
[53:26] with them to make sure there's no stone
[53:28] unturned if you stole from somebody if
[53:30] you took money from somebody if you've
[53:32] done something wrong with them go around
[53:33] and go around to every one of them and
[53:35] say i'm sorry even if you think that
[53:37] there's nothing that you did if there's
[53:38] anything in your mind that's preventing
[53:40] you from having peace it's time to go
[53:42] make everything right
[53:44] so that you're conformed to the image of
[53:46] his son
[53:49] because every if there's some kind of
[53:50] tormenting spirit on your
[53:52] tormenting tormenting devil that's
[53:54] messing around with your spirit that's
[53:55] giving you grief in your body
[53:58] the devil won't move until you make
[54:00] everything right
[54:02] now brother emma said in the deep
[54:03] calleth to the deep he said if there's
[54:04] unconfessed sin or something or some out
[54:06] of the will of god you could anoint them
[54:08] all night long and cry and scream and do
[54:11] all you wish to that demon will stay
[54:13] right there you see how many times some
[54:15] people sometimes will come up to the
[54:17] altar and get the ministry to pray for
[54:18] us and cry over us and there's a great
[54:20] big commotion made and yet that the
[54:21] devil will stay right there tore him in
[54:24] all day long tormenting all night long
[54:26] because there's something still left
[54:28] undone in your life he said that's right
[54:30] he has a right to well that's what you
[54:32] have to watch god has put a curse on
[54:34] somebody for something then you come
[54:36] along and take it off you get in trouble
[54:38] like moses did that's right
[54:40] he's here the holy spirit now
[54:42] and brother i'm saying it sees see if
[54:45] there's unconfessed sin or something the
[54:46] devil's got a right to stay right there
[54:50] until you get your heart right with god
[54:53] because god wants your heart
[54:55] he wants your heart he wants you to give
[54:57] your heart to him
[54:59] are we willing to make things right will
[55:01] you give your heart to the lord will you
[55:03] make all wrongs right will you apologize
[55:06] to anybody that's necessary will you lay
[55:08] aside all your pride and stubbornness
[55:10] and admit if you're wrong will you repay
[55:12] the things you stole will you set
[55:13] straight and mend the things the wrongs
[55:15] you've committed well you ask
[55:17] forgiveness to god and man see sickness
[55:19] sometimes makes things serious the tor
[55:21] when the tormentor comes it makes things
[55:23] serious so let's get serious about god
[55:26] serious about god because god sometimes
[55:28] he'll permit death or sickness because
[55:31] of disobedience
[55:33] you got a soul that god is after
[55:37] i'm running out of time i'm not used to
[55:39] just having an hour
[55:45] in the morning
[55:47] you you got a soul that god is after and
[55:49] that soul gives you the ability to
[55:51] choose this morning that's what
[55:53] separates you from an animal that you're
[55:54] not just like a chimpanzee or something
[55:56] that you're not you're not an animal
[55:57] you've got you've got something down on
[55:59] the inside that guides your life that
[56:02] guides your direction and and gives you
[56:04] it gives you the ability to choose god
[56:07] every man and a woman in earth has a
[56:09] soul a man in a bar has a soul
[56:12] every murder in prison has a soul
[56:14] the homeless person filling the subway
[56:16] car
[56:16] with with us a foul stench as i've i've
[56:19] been acquainted with as i drove road to
[56:20] atlanta and sometimes they got a soul
[56:22] you sometimes you look at somebody
[56:23] that's in a different situation in life
[56:25] and you think well there's something
[56:26] different no that person has a soul and
[56:29] brother said when he would go into
[56:30] africa and look at the people eating
[56:31] maggots and look at the way they lived
[56:33] he said they've got just as right much
[56:35] right to hear the gospel as you or i do
[56:38] because you've got a soul and an animal
[56:40] doesn't have a soul they've got
[56:42] something that kind of kind of they they
[56:44] can kind of go get water and do some
[56:46] little tricks and things but they don't
[56:47] have nothing to think with they don't
[56:49] have nothing to choose with
[56:51] you remember that that gorilla that they
[56:53] talk sign language to and i remember
[56:55] that was in the news where they they
[56:56] taught it sign language and they asked
[56:58] it one time it could like say some
[57:00] little things and and respond to
[57:01] questions and they said what they asked
[57:03] it what about god and they said i don't
[57:05] know nothing about god
[57:06] because the soul is how you respond to
[57:08] god that little animal he didn't know it
[57:11] didn't have a way to answer back it just
[57:13] it just has a way to you know you can
[57:15] put glasses on and and put a little hat
[57:17] on take it off and ride around on a
[57:19] unicycle or something like that but
[57:20] you've got a soul on the inside that
[57:22] gives you a way to respond
[57:24] and brother adam said those people in
[57:26] africa eat maggots and and whatnot he
[57:28] said let him hear it one time and watch
[57:29] him scream and run to the altar real
[57:31] quick because he's got a soul a deep
[57:34] cause to the deep something to respond
[57:36] to that call from god you've got a soul
[57:39] and can and can choose life so god is
[57:41] looking for a soul that will respond a
[57:44] soul he's looking for fertile ground
[57:45] that will accept his word and once that
[57:48] seed is planted in the heart it's a
[57:50] grain of wheat from then on once you're
[57:52] born again you're a christian until you
[57:54] leave this world once you've heard that
[57:56] word and received that word you're a
[57:57] christian from then on you say well you
[58:00] because you got that earnest you've got
[58:02] the earnest the the down payment has
[58:04] been paid and the earnest what is the
[58:06] earnest the baptism of the holy ghost is
[58:08] the proof the earnest is the proof that
[58:10] the rest will be paid you've got the
[58:12] proof that god is a healer the proof
[58:14] that god is a deliverer the proof that
[58:16] god still saves the proof that god is
[58:19] not a respecter of purpose the holy
[58:21] ghost is that proof the holy ghost is
[58:23] the life the holy ghost is the witness
[58:25] the holy ghost is the abstract title
[58:27] deed so how could somebody that's got
[58:30] all that
[58:31] how could they how could they get sick
[58:34] how could they get sick
[58:42] you know you got a life down on the
[58:44] inside when you get born again
[58:48] what what what is something like cancer
[58:51] something like cancer is a is a life of
[58:53] something else
[58:54] something down on the inside of that
[58:56] thing that that cancerous life it begins
[58:58] to it begins to to form in in a
[59:00] backslidden sale and and brother brown
[59:03] begins to talk about how cancer it
[59:04] usually comes from a bruise
[59:06] a bruise that strikes and the cells
[59:08] break
[59:09] what is a bruise now
[59:11] a bruise is a you got a little sale and
[59:13] it's got a purpose in your in life the
[59:14] purpose is for to to
[59:17] to help you do the things to fight off
[59:19] germs to fight infection and every cell
[59:21] in your body has a purpose
[59:23] and it gets bruised maybe it gets
[59:24] injured maybe like like somebody's
[59:26] sitting in church sometimes and somebody
[59:27] says something a little bit wrong and
[59:28] they get bruised and they draw up and
[59:30] they begin to think well maybe i just
[59:31] need to sit at home maybe i just don't
[59:33] need to come to church anymore maybe
[59:34] they begin to think forget their purpose
[59:37] and see that when when someone a bruise
[59:38] happens that's right when that devil can
[59:40] begin to work
[59:42] and the bruise that that the the life of
[59:44] satan begins to enter into that bruised
[59:46] cell and it start begins to turn
[59:48] cancerous
[59:50] it's bruised because something happened
[59:51] to it he said a cancer comes from a
[59:53] bruise a bruised cell usually is where
[59:54] it comes from all mashed up the cell is
[59:57] backslidden if something happens in
[59:59] there that fails to get the function of
[1:00:01] blood to it right
[1:00:02] that fails to get the blood working
[1:00:04] right
[1:00:05] and cancer begins to happen and that
[1:00:06] life is that life so now you've got two
[1:00:09] things that the life of that cancer and
[1:00:10] the life of god
[1:00:12] worn out and then life the life of god
[1:00:15] you know can cast out that cancer he
[1:00:18] said a life another life not your life a
[1:00:20] germ comes in there it's a spirit first
[1:00:22] that develops around it by germ or takes
[1:00:24] the germ that's already in your body and
[1:00:26] takes its place and satan can't create
[1:00:28] so he begins to build sales growth it
[1:00:31] begins to build on that life of that way
[1:00:34] on the inside is that life and then
[1:00:35] cells begin to build around that life a
[1:00:38] cataract does the same thing it gets
[1:00:40] bigger and what's it doing your little
[1:00:42] germ is to make you live that germ is to
[1:00:44] suck the blood from you to kill you and
[1:00:46] you get that cancer a cancer a big old
[1:00:48] massive confusion growing and growing
[1:00:51] and and going through your body and
[1:00:52] going like a spider web going everywhere
[1:00:55] because the problem if we get down to
[1:00:57] the problem the root cause
[1:00:58] the problem is there's a foreign life in
[1:01:00] there there's another life in there
[1:01:04] another life he said it's another life
[1:01:06] different from your life living in you
[1:01:08] and it's tormenting sapping your life
[1:01:10] that's the reason jesus called it a
[1:01:13] devil
[1:01:13] the devil's got one duty to do and
[1:01:15] that's take your life to cut your days
[1:01:18] short of three score and ten
[1:01:20] but you know doctors a lot of times they
[1:01:22] can patch things up and cut things out
[1:01:24] and everything but but the only one that
[1:01:26] can kick the life out is the life of god
[1:01:29] that's why this morning we still believe
[1:01:30] in healing we still believe it in the
[1:01:32] power of god no matter what what is
[1:01:34] afflicting you this morning whether it's
[1:01:35] cancer or tuberculosis or a lung issue
[1:01:38] or whatever or mind battles that god is
[1:01:41] still able to heal and deliver doctors
[1:01:43] in medicine can't heal they can patch
[1:01:45] things up and let
[1:01:46] and and the light let the life of god
[1:01:48] begin to close the wombs and things but
[1:01:50] we've got a god on the scene that
[1:01:53] we've got access to all these benefits
[1:01:55] of healing like in psalms
[1:01:57] 103 that we read who forgiveth all thine
[1:01:59] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[1:02:03] and in exodus chapter 15 for i am the
[1:02:05] lord that healeth thee and in isaiah 53
[1:02:08] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:02:10] was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:02:12] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:02:14] and with his stripes we are healed so
[1:02:17] what what is divine healing divine
[1:02:18] healing is dealing with that life when
[1:02:21] you come with faith that believing that
[1:02:23] god is able to cast that life out to get
[1:02:26] the life of the devil out that's why in
[1:02:28] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[1:02:30] out because you're being healed the
[1:02:33] unclean spirit is cast out what is
[1:02:35] divine healing it was when that that
[1:02:37] foreign life is extracted that foreign
[1:02:41] life is called out
[1:02:42] and the way the way that jesus did it
[1:02:45] when he would he would just say go
[1:02:47] when he when that when that devil came
[1:02:49] when they were you know all the devils
[1:02:50] in legion they were wanting to go into
[1:02:53] the swine
[1:02:54] and he didn't pray a big long fervent
[1:02:56] prayer or anything he just said one word
[1:02:57] go
[1:03:00] why because the devil's recognized what
[1:03:01] do they recognize in life
[1:03:03] the devil ain't recognizing all the
[1:03:05] intellectual understanding and and
[1:03:06] somebody that's trying to fake it but
[1:03:08] they'll recognize life
[1:03:11] jesus said in luke chapter four when
[1:03:13] jesus rebuked him legion saying he said
[1:03:15] hold thy peace and come out of him he
[1:03:17] just spoke the words come out of him
[1:03:20] when the life is cast out the battle is
[1:03:22] over and how is the life cast out
[1:03:24] through the preaching of the word
[1:03:26] through the preaching of the gospel cast
[1:03:27] out that life
[1:03:29] what is it slow and steady wins the race
[1:03:31] when the when the life is cast out that
[1:03:33] that thing begins to bloat and you begin
[1:03:35] to wonder with something happening that
[1:03:36] that life is cast out of that cancer on
[1:03:38] the inside and it begins to bloat and
[1:03:40] begins to rot and die you begin to think
[1:03:42] something's wrong but slow and steady is
[1:03:45] what wins the race because you just
[1:03:47] believe that god is moving something's
[1:03:49] beginning to work and and don't don't
[1:03:51] get uh let your faith be faltered when
[1:03:53] when you begin to be healed and
[1:03:55] and you you're you know that thing
[1:03:57] begins to that that that carcass on the
[1:04:00] inside begins to rot
[1:04:03] you just stay right with it stay right
[1:04:05] with what god wants you to believe
[1:04:07] brother adam said don't you disbelieve
[1:04:09] stay right with it mean it from your
[1:04:11] heart say no sir i'll not be moved no
[1:04:13] matter how sick i get that doesn't have
[1:04:15] nothing to do with it
[1:04:17] then the first thing you know you'll be
[1:04:19] getting cleared up everything will be
[1:04:21] all right then
[1:04:22] see it's dead
[1:04:24] the operation that the doctor would have
[1:04:26] taken from you that same growth is
[1:04:28] laying in you with no life in it
[1:04:30] when it's cast out by divine healing
[1:04:33] he said the gift of divine healing was
[1:04:35] in you if you got healed
[1:04:37] it's you the one any gift operates by
[1:04:40] faith
[1:04:41] and no matter how much gift of divine
[1:04:43] healing i got i believe it with all my
[1:04:45] heart but you could stand here and if
[1:04:46] you haven't got the same kind of faith
[1:04:49] it don't do you no good what is that the
[1:04:51] choice to believe the choice that you
[1:04:54] have because you have a soul to believe
[1:04:57] to believe god's word he said i could
[1:05:00] pray for you for hours and weeks and
[1:05:01] months and isn't the preachers with the
[1:05:03] divine healing it's you that's got the
[1:05:06] gift of divine healing that believes in
[1:05:08] being healed because it's by faith
[1:05:11] by faith every operation of god is by
[1:05:15] faith
[1:05:16] everything we have is by faith this
[1:05:18] morning so when you get it real down in
[1:05:20] a place of despondency do like abraham
[1:05:23] and let your faith grow as every day
[1:05:24] walked by when he didn't have that child
[1:05:27] every year and people were saying well
[1:05:28] where's the child at his faith began to
[1:05:30] grow moses when he got to the red sea
[1:05:33] his faith began to grow because of all
[1:05:35] the things that he'd seen and
[1:05:36] dave daniel's faith got stronger and
[1:05:39] stronger the longer that they were in
[1:05:40] babylon when you get into a particular
[1:05:42] predicament let your faith grow the
[1:05:44] worse it gets the more of a miracle it's
[1:05:47] going to be
[1:05:48] no matter how bad it looks yet we still
[1:05:51] have a promise don't forget all the
[1:05:53] benefits that you have as a believer
[1:05:55] forget not all your benefits don't let
[1:05:58] your soul be troubled because we've got
[1:06:00] benefits as christians and those
[1:06:02] benefits that oh that the devil has the
[1:06:04] devil can have no preeminence in your
[1:06:06] life if you'll just take god at his word
[1:06:09] and give god your heart turn your heart
[1:06:11] to god and if you're at a place where if
[1:06:13] you're in a place where the devil's just
[1:06:15] running rough shot over your life and
[1:06:17] tormenting your spirit figure out what
[1:06:20] it's going to take if you have to go
[1:06:21] around to everybody and say ask for
[1:06:23] forgiveness
[1:06:25] because we've we've got benefits
[1:06:29] that's why mark chapter 11 says
[1:06:30] therefore i say unto you what things
[1:06:32] soever you desire when you pray believe
[1:06:35] that you receive them and you shall have
[1:06:37] them why because we come with faith
[1:06:40] believing
[1:06:41] we've got we've come with faith
[1:06:43] everything is by faith believing that
[1:06:46] god is able
[1:06:49] and brother adam said what's going to
[1:06:50] happen now if you accept christ as your
[1:06:52] healer
[1:06:53] and believe in your heart that something
[1:06:54] has happened to you and you believe
[1:06:55] you're healed
[1:06:57] are you going to believe that you're
[1:06:58] healed
[1:06:59] he said don't let the devil pin nothing
[1:07:02] else on you
[1:07:03] just keep on doctors say doctor how does
[1:07:06] it look he said why is still there and
[1:07:07] the musicians can go ahead and come
[1:07:09] and your heart you know you know what's
[1:07:11] happened first thing he will say say
[1:07:13] wonder what happened to that thing
[1:07:15] then say look doctor i'm going to tell
[1:07:17] you

[1:07:22] jesus christ healed me
[1:07:24] that's right jesus christ heal me that's
[1:07:26] what he said you're going to be able to
[1:07:27] tell the doctor
[1:07:29] when something something began to happen
[1:07:30] don't have any more doubt
[1:07:32] he said we understand where it comes
[1:07:34] from now we know it's a devil and we
[1:07:36] know when he leaves he has to come and
[1:07:38] command of god he has to
[1:07:40] god's done said so he has to leave this
