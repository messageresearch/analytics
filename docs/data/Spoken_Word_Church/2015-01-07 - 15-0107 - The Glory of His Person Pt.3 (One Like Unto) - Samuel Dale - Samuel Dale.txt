back that has been sick and had to miss and everything we're glad to have you back with us talk to Brother Gary yesterday I guess or today one and he was a little bit better his voice is up and and he seems to be doing better on that so just keep praying for him that the Lord would you know would be with him I know you already have a sister Johnny is in the hospital and she had the flu and things and just said she said she didn't ever pass out but she fell into the floor and they had to take her to the hospital and things but just keep praying for it the Lord would would be with her amen uh trying to get the announcements out of the way remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday if any of you want to go with us make sure you let us know where we can go that'll be on what the 20th I think it be the third Saturday but remember that remember that Wade will be speaking this weekend I pray that you have uh done as he asked that you would listen to the stature or read the stature of a perfect man and and you know have that especially that and blasphemous names if you would we listen to both of them already this week and it's really been a it's a great time sometimes to sit down and just listen you know without having to plan for whatever you're doing I I generally have to listen in a rotation see if something that I'm speaking about but when you can just sit down and put on the tape and listen it's really a a great thing and if you listen to that you'll hear Brother randam explaining over and over and over that you're born again at Faith and then you know while all these people get confused about that I don't understand it but that's the way it's got to be for everybody all right if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn in Revelations 1 and then we will go to Exodus 33 Revelations 1 Exodus 33 keep us in your prayers they uh finally got our test back from the uh sleep ever how you say that word Acme or AC me or whoever it is what whatever and I laugh because they said I stopped breathing 152 times with and I didn't sleep 4 hours I know because I was awake most of the night so I don't I don't know what's keeping me awake and keeping me alive and they said that that my uh uh oxygen level had got down as low as 87 during the night and said no wonder you wake up a lot I said okay but they don't know that when I wake up I pray so I don't worry about it I just say by Stripes I'm Healed and I keep right on going he's old Devil's cutting off trying to stop my breathing trying to stop everything try to cold and all he's doing doing it to all of us but he can't defeat us so what we worried about it for and if he does everything's all right anyway that's right who's worried you know I don't have no concern whatsoever I have no fear in that line of anything that the devil can do to me CU he can't do it until God gets through with me then when he's through with me I'm that's all right you know but just just pray for us that the Lord would you know take everything and make it work out for his honor and Glory all right Revelations 1 where we've been reading and then we'll go to Exodus 33 Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your love and your grace unto us thank you for all the things that you've given unto us we know you give to us freely thank you for taking care of us all of these years of what the doctors have said we got this we got that we don't worry about what they say it's what you say you say by your stripes we are already healed and we're not concerned we love you we thank you we just ask you to bless each one remember the sick ones remember Sister Johnny there in the hospital Brother Gary Lord the different ones that are sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe it and we just depend upon that have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts about what to say to your people in jesus' name amen revelation 1 we'll start verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us right now notice you know a voice comes and said I am Alpha and Oma all right now he knew as I've tried to emphasize so much he knew whose voice that was he didn't have no problems with that see all right and what thou seest right in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto samna unto per pergamus under Tiara under Sardis and under Philadelphia and under lady oia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle maybe an odd scripture to get to when we finally get to the to the part we want to bring out tonight but Exodus 33 and we'll begin reading at Verse 18 if you remember the background story Moses says Lord I'd like to see you what about as many times as he been in personal contact with him things that had happened but he's never seen him like he wanted to and he said Lord I'd just like to see you well he didn't mean I'd like to see you in Revelations I'd like to see you in this and that of the other cuz he'd seen that all right so what's what he's saying and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before for thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou cast not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me Thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by now watch what heus saying now it shall come to pass while my glory now we're talking about the Sevenfold Glory of his person this is all a background to get to that part so now watch what he's saying he shall come to pass while my Glory passees by that I will put thee in the Cliff of the rock so now his glory is going to pass by and he's going to be over here taking him putting him in a rock read your Bible and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by look at and I'll take I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall shall not be seen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try to get to a point tonight I've been trying to for a while to to do but you know I was going to go on into the Sevenfold Glory of his person but when when I got into the part of thinking on it then it began to develop into other things that I believe we need to understand there you know and and uh be able to follow it in a line but now what have we been doing we've been using Revelations 1 and we saw in Revelations 1 that Jesus says now John before I show you anything I want you to know who I am right CU he had said I am Alpha and speak of the beginning and the ending now then he says now John I'm being that Alpha and Omega said now you just stand and listen to me while that was the quotes we gave from the prophets you know on the seven Church ages and on the patmas vision now think about what's taking place he shows John these things and he says now before you before I show you anything I want you to know who I am I'm the alpha I'm the Omega I'm the beginning I'm the ending I'm all of it all right and said just stand there now and just listen we we read there in Revelations that it takes just a minute to read uh you know almost the whole chapter of one you know maybe one two minutes but yet we look at those things as uh you know we just read it but I don't look at the Bible that way I look at it in the bases of that maybe this would have been quite a while you know what's the needing be in a hurry the Eternal God is going to speak and he wants to make sure that John understands him so it's not you know a lot of time we just read something and we think that was just a two-minute Affair like I said about uh Nicodemus and Jesus talking that might have been hours in conversation you know see we we we narrow those things down and want to make them a little bitty short stories instead of thinking now he says John I'm Alpha and Omega now you just stand there and listen now you know John whose voice this is amen it wasn't a trumpet it's just stating in that way right that it's like a trumpet it wasn't a to to it was a voice it said something see when we started off in there in Revelation he said now I'm the alpha and omega you know a voice speaking well now there was no problem with John understanding whose voice that was because he knew that voice all right and he knew that he was to be there cuz he said he was you know verse about nine he said I was on patmas for you know the word of the Lord he knew he was there for a reason he wasn't just throw out there for no no reason he knew he was there for some reason and he was there to what hear the things and then said write it in a book right and send it unto the seven Church ages all right now in doing that then John knows who's talking he knows that voice see he knows this dire but yet he's looking maybe in another Direction cuz it said and he turned to see The Voice the prophet you remember we gave it the voice in the person is the same right so that was to be the voice of almighty God that would speak all right and as he would be doing that he says now John you just hold on a minute before I take you any further in all all of this I want you to know who I am and I want you to stand still and just listen well right John pays close attention and he turns to see that voice and probably in himself was expecting to see the Lord Jesus Christ standing there because he knew his voice all right now I've tried to emphasize that a lot trying to get something to you that will help us uh maybe a little further along all right and uh this is with way taking the Sunday service is it giving me more time to kind of just you know Coast a little and if I repeat myself a lot just don't worry about it it might be for me but it might be for you too you know so just hang on all right but now John you write this book you send it to the seven Church ages all right and said now you know whose voice it is but when he turned to see the voice now notice he he's a prophet and things are taking place when he turned it's kind of like chapter four and five you remember there in in he he sees a throne then he sees one on the throne all this is stages of something transpiring it's just not he turns to see a throne and one sitting on the throne it's not that way he emphasizes it all right so is it here he hears the voice he turns to expecting to see the Lord Jesus all right and then but it wasn't a problem when he looked now and he saw seven golden candlesticks seven lampstands you can to go through all of the things the prophet did with expressing it but he sees that first and he stands and looks at it then he sees one standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick am all right now as I said he was expecting probably to turn to see the Lord Jesus standing there but he realizes that some IND different because he's not seeing Jesus Christ you know the human person that he knew upon Earth so he looks and he says all right there's seven golden candlesticks he knows he's got to write these things and send it to him but then he saw one standing in the midst of the seven golden canand like unto the son of man that's right he did didn't see the Lord Jesus Christ in human flesh of the bodily form of the Lord Jesus that was stood on Earth are you with me but what does he see he sees a bodily form right right now listen with me and think about it he sees a bodily form and he knows that bodily form is the one one that's speaking to him not just looking at it like do you see that picture over Y no he knows that voice is coming from this form that he sees standing before him in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick amen now that's what I've been trying to get us to look at and he has no problem then looking at this form that he sees you know right and and he doesn't look around oh you're not Jesus you know no he knows the voice amen just like Paul what I am Jesus whom thou persecuted right you see he's looking here and he sees one standing in the midst of the seven golden candles like unto the son of man he knows it is not the flesh form that he's looking at amen but he knows he's looking at a body because he describes it later in you know the face and the the ha and the feet and the things that we'll we'll get to it but he saw one standing in the midst of the seven golden Cy like unto the son of man all right now we know like means same person or same being or likenesses whatever all right and he knew who it was that was speaking to him but he's looking at a at a symbol and the symbol is not just the church ages you know the candles candlesticks which one you want to use but he actually sees a person right he describes that person as we'll go along later so he's not surprised that he didn't see the person of Jesus when he turned but he saw the body now not the the body of the Lord Jesus Christ body that we look at I've expressed that but he saw this body standing in the seven golden candlesticks right one like unto the son of man in other words the son of man in another form an imorph are changing his form all right now if he saw him in another form what form did he see him in that's that's the point I want you to to dwell with me for a little while am he saw him in the bodily form and it wouldn't have been necessarily to look like the bodily form of the Lord Jesus Christ you know as we talk about it and talk about what he looked like and thing but he sees a bride form God is going to reveal himself where does he really reveal himself as being okay John I want you to know who I am and I want you to stand still and listen now and I want you to see this form all right we've been through it over and over through why we are not a denomination where brother brand said he saw a bride standing in the candlesticks draw outen all right saw him in that all right this description that he gives is a description of the Bride right all right but now it it can't be a second person right cuz if it was it wouldn't be saying like unto the son of man it just say some man but when it's emphasizing like unto the son of man it means simply that he's changed forms all and that's not the flesh form but it's the form that he's revealing himself in and Reve heing himself in Bride form G about the PS with a golden girdle you know all of the things we'll get back to more on that later i' I tried to put a lot of emphasis in it and you know what he was looking at 2 Thessalonians 1 and10 covers it when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints right to be glorified in his Saints all one light we went through his bride perhaps not a man a woman and coming down to see that it even winds up being the judge because of the girdle and the the places where it was put in all judgment according to John I think it's 532 is the judgment is put into the hands of the son all right so now I have no problem then looking at what John is looking at and saying that this was the Bride of Jesus Christ all right and that bride of Jesus Christ would be the word for the age and time and it would be be the Son of God right you say no no it's the son of man see you just getting spiritual enough to flop difference between Son of God and son of man just stay with me in what I'm talking about all right because brother random and saying who is this son of man he said in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God that's I think it's the rising the sun all right see then you could look at him and see that that Son of God was the one that came out in the beginning but now he's come down to show himself in Bride form like unto the son of man see not being the physical son of man but one like unto the son of man all right now you better hold on a little bit on that to think about it because we don't want to go too far in that line so let's stay with what did De see there he saw the glorified Lord Jesus Christ in Bride form the Son of God the Son of God that's why it says he's like un to the son of man because what's the difference in it brother Brown said there is no difference this day except the bodily form right right right there's no Del in God and his bride except for the bodily form that she's inen all right right so it's like unto the son of man so he sees him standing there as the glorified Son of God we'll read these in a minute all right he says John write this and send it to the church I want the church to realize who they are is that why he sing it I want the church to realize who they are so I'm not just going to start writing about the church ages and what happens in the ages and times sure he does that but he's laying a background for us to see like I've always told you to me the Book of Revelation is the greatest of all the books because there's nowhere in the Book of Revelation do you see Jesus Christ by himself he's always with somebody because he'll never do that again because that's the way he joined himself all but are you listening watch what he says now judgment is given to the son now where do we get down I know we won't deny to where I'm going anyway but where do we get down to where it says that no man man to seen God at any time but the only begotten had the clarity you know if you study brother Brown's message real closely it gets very very close in some places that there is actually a quote and forget time we'll read it where he says that Jesus had no no legs no arms no hands EX you know God had no hand arms or legs except in Jesus and he says you can't see him but yet what we just read in the scriptures declares that Moses saw right a form right and brother R said he saw the ofne a form right amen all right now think about it not only does he show John who he is he shows John where he is in his church and that church is his body the Believers and that church must be revealed remember the message we brought that out Christ Myst God revealed she is to be revealed the bride is to be revealed all right that's right why because she and the word becomes one and when you're revealing the word you're automatically revealing the person that you're talking about so are you listening now what did John see so let's just read a few quotes and then we'll get on to our thought what did John see all right let's go on over to number two brotherr we quoted number one course around talk about how that one like unto the son of man who was this his bride one like watch how the the Holiness of Jesus covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood look the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the bride of Christ that's your golden girdle all right but now look at what that's that's the first one look at number two and see what he says which is the revelation of Jesus Christ paragraph 74 and also the 14th and 15th verses describes his Sevenfold Glory of his person oh it's beautiful when we see Christ in his Sevenfold personage of Sevenfold beings now you following him of his personage in his glorious Resurrection now you're going to have to hold a point there because they can't be a Sevenfold beings but the being can be divided into his into Sevenfold personage I gave that one this to where if somebody come along they get it and pick it up and say well well what about this you know all right we see Christ in his seven fold personage watch him now Sevenfold beings that looks like seven beings no it's like the Bible says about that there's what the spirit it's one Holy Spirit but the Bible says there seven spirits it's not seven spirits it's a manifestation of God in seven ways right so that's what I said about this these Sevenfold beings of his personage in his glorious Resurrection now that's what you're looking at that's what he says because it's the 15 14 15 you see him in that Sevenfold Glory all right look at the next one look at number three the patmas vision paragraph 171 now we're going to read the Sevenfold Glory of his person see it's one person not Sevenfold beings right it's one person made manifest in seven ways to cover the point right now watch He's seven things here he mentions his head his hair his eyes his feet his voice seven things he mentioned here the Sevenfold Glory of Jesus Christ and then he says now let me read it to you so he begins to read it and look what he gets to go on up because we'll get back to this in the message later what a vision what did he see here the Sevenfold Glory of his personage you know what did he see the glorified Son of God and Assemble you see why I emphasize the Son of God because it is not the son of man is one like the son of man falling back to see that that it's not me and you that's being made manifest it's God being made manifest in you and I Paul says what Christ in you the hope of glory that's right but it's a Sevenfold Glory we're not going to get into that part because that's going to be kind of hard to to follow because you got his face what and you got his hair what and and I I ask you to if you will to uh somebody to draw that you know of what you see because it it's got to be him but I I want to see the drawing that can come out of it feet like Bryce and all kind of things we ain't to that yet see we got to pick up something here this is in the the point of trying to understand it all right look what he gets to look what he says on the message of the Resurrection this is 3A the to the brothers and he's talking about he's on Alcatraz he's out here and all the things that happening he's on the Lord's day looking over the water maybe God loving his see her and he said I heard the voice of many Waters and when uh voice of trumpet and when I turned to seea I saw s and golden candles and the one standing in the midst of them lik un to the son of man glorified state right glorified state so this is just not seeing us in uh you get over to chapter two and chapter 3 and then you'll see about us being on Earth but this is showing us there and showing him in us the glorified Son of God that's why it says it's like unto the son of man because it is not the son of man man it is the bride she can be the son of man yeah we we'll go there amen but you got to hold it in to a point and and you know I hope you're you're at least thinking with me but he saw him in a glorified State look at the next one number four patma Vision paragraph 53 or page 53 excuse me Church age book there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring watch so is he glorified in the midst of the churches it is the Lord's Day John sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the finish a glorified state so now now when John is being shown on patmas he's showing the bride already in a glorified condition amen I said that may be a little bit trickier or you're thinking but we'll do our best to try to back up on it later because see then you go to chapter 2 and chapter 3 and you see the bad things about the church ages and the thing but you also see the good right right what's your point brother Dale he's showing us in chapter one already into what he sees us to be the glorified Son of God the body the body that he inhabits right see then it's not the body of Jesus that you're looking at right it's the bride amen which is what his body I thought that's what we believe the scripture said you know that we were his body and that he was the head all right and seeing that it's in a glorified State look at the next one page 52 fision number five How Deeply moving and inspiring was the appearing of Jesus to John what he has no problem with saying Jesus to John because that's what I've been talking about if you've been thinking I've been talking about a bride I'm I'm talking about Jesus CU who was in exile for the cause of the word and behold the Living Word now stands before him what an Illuminating Vision forever descriptive attribute has a significance what a revelation of his glorious being look what he thinks about himself I mean thinks about us look what he thinks about you that he would start off in the book of re rations talking about you and who you are sure then he has to drop back and take Earthly things but that's that's no problem it's just seeing his glorious being but seeing it where it's at you understand why he's a saying one like unto the son of man now we're going to get a couple of scriptures in just a minute we're going to go with something to try to understand but I want you to follow me of what I'm saying whether you agree with me or not that's up to you because I can't make you agree but what did John see before did I tell you anything I want you to know who I am and just stand there and listen now cuz I'm going to show you who I am and where I'm at and he showed seven golden candlesticks that would be enough to see the bride of Christ because you could take those the prophet did and preach great lengthy messages on the the lampstands and what they meant and a different thing but then he saw one in the midst of the seven golden candles sck like unto the son of man when do we get to that descriptive part of him that he was saying just now about the Glorious things of the that any little thing has a has a lot of meaning to it his hair like wool his face white his you know but what I want you to think about symbols John is shown in symbols right The Book of Revelations is written in symbols that's why it won't say the son of man it'll say one like to the son of man it's a symbol that has to be and it took a prophet to understand those symbols for us to be able to follow it see now this is not I want to make sure you follow me where then and I can use these two scriptures this is not seeing the flesh man of Jesus Christ but this is you know his body while he was here on Earth else it would not have said one like unto the son of man it would have said the son of man all right but saying like means that it's another form of the same person right all right similar resemblance corresponding are the same form appearance that's the word like but now for just a moment I want you to think with me because this is very valuable to understand the symbols the forms and the things the prophet tells us the symbols you know nobody could tell us those symbols they had them all messed up even brother brandham before God revealed it said you know it said about that arrows of love you know shooting a little Cupid riding along until God revealed it all right now what I want you to think with me a minute about this form of the son of man or one lik un to the son of man and and follow it in the scriptures to where we can get an understanding so go ahead with number six brothers which is Daniel 3 and 25 now watch these two scriptures and you'll understand what I'm talking about because it can be it will be two different or whatever you're looking at forms will be used and that's what we got to get to to understand that in the Book of Revelation you're seeing God in another form a bodily form which is the Bride of Jesus Christ right all that's the form it's into John on pmas so now watch what he saying Daniel 3:25 he said he answered and said lo I see four men loose walk in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God right and you know the story how the three Hebrew children were cast into the fiery furnace you know and and the things and you know it killed the people that throw them in and and all of the story and and then who is it Nebuchadnezzar comes up and you know he's looking down in there the next day and and he looks down at it and he said how many did we throw in in they said we throw three in he says uh 1 2 3 4 and he says they're not hurt because the Bible emphasizes it it's not hurt so now we know for certainty that God had to been the fourth man right amen right I mean that ought to be sensible the fourth man was God himself amen right all right now to look down and see him not burning that's what emphasizing have no hurt see by not you know if he if he didn't even see the Fourth Man Nebuchadnezzar would have known something Supernatural was taking place right right had he not even seen the Fourth Man he knew that something was protecting amen these and how would he come up with what he come and said the form is like the Son of God now this is a heathen King this is not a Jewish rabbi or a high priest right that was supposed known about the coming down of God the condescending and the the Loos the theop the thing coming down from the beginning this is a heathen King and look he said he's got a formed to him right amen like I said if he hadn't seen nothing he would have know something Supernatural was taking place but he sees the form of a man he knows that that form of that man has to be God himself now watch and if you can see God you you you can't see God we'll get to that in a minute he knew that if he could see something it would have to be the Son of God because he knew he couldn't see God all right father with me now why would he jump over now go ahead with number seven and let's read this one from Daniel and he said I saw in the night vision behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and he came to the Ancient of Days and brought him near why would he switch over and call him one lik and the son of man why would it emphasize one liking a son of man you already got a pretty good story going by seeing the Fourth Man in the fire and realizing the Fourth Man In The Fire has to be God and if you can see it it would have to be the Son of God now you know the story of Daniel 7 and you know what it all covers we won't have time to go into it but we'll just state it you know that's going to the white Throne judgment and the Ancient of Days and the things that sit and the bride is sitting with him are we right y right is revelation what 17 and and Daniel 7 supposed to both be the white Throne judgment I believe I'm right on those scriptures are you following me right when he sees one in comparison with his looking at it he says he's the son of God because if I can see it it's got to be God and I can only see four down there I got them counted one 2 three four you know but I'd like for you to answer me one question what happened to the fourth man I know the three Hebrew children were taken out of the FY furnace but what happened to the fourth man just a little point but here you're dealing with a multitude of people one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven right Y and we're to sit on the throne with him right the white throne you get the point what I'm driving Nebuchadnezzar sees one called him Son of God he sees many he called him son of man right right does that ring a bell he sees one and he says Son of God he sees many coming to the white throne judgment you know to sit on the Judgment with him the clouds of heaven and he says one like the son of man trying to explain Revelations 1 that if in Revelations 1 he sees one like unto the son of man a multiple form but it was one body this don't seem to be hitting right tonight don't worry about it I'll preach it again next Wednesday iin concern I'm just telling you you're going to have to think it's not to go to church and Glory Hallelujah we're doing good and everything feels good and give us a piece of ice we'll run down through I get you some chill bumps or whatever you want to do right I thought it was the word of God we were supposed to be concerned with I thought we were to talk about the word of God and I thought the word of God was the Believers that was in the book that's what I thought that's right amen do you need that quote the Believers in the book they are the word amen John sees it over on patmas already transformed into a glorified state right all totally finished y all right I'll go on with it if I have to I'll drop back write your questions out about it notice now this one Daniel sees in chapter 3 and he only sees one man you know with the three Hebrew children and in Daniel 7 he sees a large group of people this has got to be the same person right right if it's not then you got two Gods so it's got to be the same person in other words the same person made manifest in another form and if Nicodemus could see one and say son of God and Daniel could see many and say son of man it's got to be the same person throughout the Bible God has revealed himself in many forms will you go with me he's the uh son of man Son of God Son of David alpha and omega beginning and the ending Jehovah Gyra Jehovah graa all of the many different things that he has revealed himself in that form but it's the same God amen now if you don't follow this line you're sure going to miss when we get to the Sevenfold Glory of his person where the face is white and the hair is white and the Feet's Bryce and see Revelations 1 and3 says one like un the son of man see then that would be God in another form I morphe be one of the forms that he reveals himself to us and watch what I want you to see is that God has taken many forms to reveal himself right that's right now none of the forms reveal you and I so it a't no need to even thinking about H like wool and what this is and what that can be get it all out of your mind get the feet of BR get all that out of your mind and just leave it alone because all of the forms that God has had has been revealing himself right throughout the word but it's the same person making himself known same person making itself known now just for a minute and I'll back up I know I'm going to have to Sunday anyway I mean Wednesday next Wednesday but now remember what we said so go ahead brother and pull up 7 a which is Exodus 33 and you'll see why I use this scripture all right and he said thou can not see my face for th shall no man see me and live now get the point Moses had seen him in many ways many forms many things happened the burning bush and all kind of experiences he' talked to him the Bible said what lip to ear I believe is that right and it had said something about seeing him face to face but yet he says Moses you can't see my face and live amen so Moses said okay is any other way I can do it he says go in over there and stand in that Cliff to the Rock remember it was the same Rock to me is the same rock that Moses smoked where the water came out of I don't have no problem with that go stand where you stood in the revelation of your faith and the things has taken place that you have done and seen and all of the miraculous things that's took place stand in that why can't you and I do that tonight folks you mean what God has revealed to you and I our children could confound the scholars and things right over the Simplicity of the Gospel that they've heard it's ain't been no this Fly by Night time but you understand what I'm getting at Moses said Lord I'd like to see you he wasn't meaning to see him in his glory of of parting the Red Sea he wasn't seeing him in his glory of of the the water and bringing it or the the great things or the the the the snakes you know and and all of that he wanted to see him and God says you can look at my back part going right on down through from where we just readz we read it when we started you can see my back part but said you can't see my face now what does he mean by that oh we've got it all figured out one day there's a man walked on the shores of Galilee and we looked up and seen his face and we see Jesus there's his face there's his face I'd like to quote a statement I've got in my pocket here I'll use it later but you know that brother randam says there's no way you can see God without God in you now that'll be on down the road a while said you can't see God without God in you all right he said well Moses and him no they didn't see God they saw the form he was in right come on are you with me they didn't see God they saw the form he was in where was he he was in the form of the Whirlwind right they seen his form but they couldn't see his face because no man can see God or ever has seen God now don't jump on down with your mind and say his son had declared him because we got a lot in here to go down hang on with us all right look at number eight and let's see if you can comprehend this scripture and see what it's talking about 1 Timothy 6:15 and 16 it's talking about Jesus Christ right which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto y yep whom no man has seen nor can see now where you going well we'll use that one at that point let's use number nine which is 1 John 4:12 go ahead with number nine no man has seen God at any time yeah but but brother Dale I I thought we could see God you're missing the point you can't see God you see the form he takes to reveal himself to you right why is it you can't see God go ahead with the next one number 10 and it explains it and look who's talking but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper shall worship who's talking is that Jesus to the little woman at the wh you know is that who it is it's Jesus talking to to the little woman you know but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in Sp spirit and in truth now can you put it together this eternal Immortal everlasting God can't be seen never been seen of no man now wait a minute mot come on I just got to explaining that that Moses said I'd love to see you he says Moses you can't see my face and live he says nobody can't do that he said go stand in that rock and I'll pass by you and said you'll see the back part and said that'll be my form that I let you see God can't be seen all right cuz God is a spirit the spirit can't be seen the spirit has to manifest itself Amen in some way amen for it to be able to be seen all right so you go back before the foundation of the world when he was self-existing now you know how I've brought that down so don't run off with the wrong way on it God is a spirit but you know what brother randam gave and I'll got it in my notes for later brother R said he's a spiritual being he said he never did have hands and things like we have until Jesus that's right but he said when he's coming down in condescending that it was the logos the theophany the Son of God and he says that theop has greater hands greater eyes and greater ears so don't ever think about it you know I've been against it from the beginning we think God is a spirit he's just a spirit he just he just he just blows everywhere and just no the prophet said it we'll bring it to you he's not like the wind he said God is a being amen but what about a being that can't be seen unless he transforms himself right unless he takes a form he can't be seen why because we're in this world he's from that world that's the best way of saying it World whatever you want to call it you said well what was he before the world oh I guess he just floating wind no no no I don't believe that never have taught nothing like that cuz I've always taught that I believe that God is a being it speaks of his hands his head his heart his hair his it speaks of a lot of things about him but just remember you can't see him right and that's why I've always taught you what I believe that when we get over there on that other side we'll see Jesus because God can't be seen we'll never enter that world where he came from that's the best words I got I don't have anything else we can't enter into that realm that atmosphere that forms or whatever is out there he's condescending this way amen he was self-existing yeah see God is a spirit now watch what your Prophet had to say go ahead with number uh number 11 let's just let the prophet answer it questions and answers on Hebrews uh 57101 wait a minute I got these backwards I'll have to swap it I know I did a while ago uh yeah okay we're right I look looking for that 456 now look the body and watch God is the spirit you how many understands that say amen amen amen what do you understand is the spirit you understand that the spirit can't be seen you understand that a spirit has to manifest itself in a form to be able to be seen amen now do you believe that see that goes on a little more thinking right look how many understand that say amen God is a spirit Jesus is a man and Jesus was God made flesh Jesus was he could never we could never see God he's a spirit you can't see Spirit no man has seen God at any time no man couldn't see God and let me say this you never seen me now he's trying to describe it right you've never seen me in all your life you never will see me that's right you see this body that declares this person that's in here amen now this body doesn't have eternal life but the spirit has eternal life this body will go back but it couldn't but it'll come forth again in its likeness just like a grain of wheat goes into the ground but are you listening now yes no man can see God because God is a spirit he said you've never seen me he said you see the body I inhabit right right now you say but wait just a minute now we got scripture yeah okay we'll get to them later but we'll go we'll bring it out they said Philip said show us the father that it satisfies he said Philip have I been so long we and said you've seen me you've seen the father amen amen now what's he mean when he was this one that said over in John that we read over there a minute ago talking to the lady that God is a spirit he's the one that put all these other scriptures into the scripture that says nobody can see God now what's he meaning he's saying Phillip I am that almighty God but you'll never see me the way you're wanting to see me that because I'm a spirit but said the the son will declare it we'll get to that scripture the son will declare it no notice it says son would Son of God is what's going to declare him so he says now have I been so long with you if you seen me you've seen the father that's now if I don't get far enough to find this quote let me state it when he saying you've never seen me in all your life you'll never see me you see the body that declares this person that's in here right so Jesus is right he said if you seen me he said when you see the father one day you'll know who I am because that body is what has to declare him amen so you see what it's talking about Jesus is right no man is seen God at any time God's the spirit oh that's just all and Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father so he had to be talking about the human element fleshly part that was standing there right cuz I believe when we get up to Glory it's not going to be a little halo over here and a little Pillar of Fire back here a little Cloud around here it's going to be Jesus because then we'll know who he is because Jesus is the only body that God ever had that's right amen now come on you said well wait a minute you want know only body God ever had the Only Natural Body God ever had we're not a natural body we are a multiplied form an amorphia of change into a multiple form body we're not just one body so the Bible's still right God is a spirit and there's no way to see it let's see if we can get this other one then we'll quit uh go ahead with the next one which is Shalom number 12 which is Shalom preached in 1964 roll it on up because you can get into all the other and read it see what it is I gave you that to where you can have it and now as when we are die you know when we die like in the physical body as we are now we are separated from one another now listen to him but it's really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other amen so now God is a spirit can't be seen I can't see you I see the body you inhabit the body you inhabit declares unto us all right come on and what but it's really this body is the only thing that identifies us to each other because we are bound in five senses C tast fi smell here and as long as we can see or feel one another w we have evidence that we're here if you're blind and can't and can't see then you can feel one another you know because what it Earthly Des senses declares one another right P it on up raise raise this and on up to but really frankly we've never seen each other did you know that we've never seen we one another you hear something speaking out of a body hear that it impersonates what's it's on the inside so then when we talk to each other we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside therefore when we speak to each other we are quickly can understand right away whether we are Christians are not come on because there's a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from amen I know I say it this way you'll flop it back home and so I'll go ahead and say it anyway you know that a lot of times I'm just the kind of a person that uh you talk to me it's hard to find out where I'm at and I understand that certain brother I won't call his name we had differed with each other years ago he said if I can get with sister Dale I can find out what brother Dale believes we said I'll never find out from him you remember that you see you'll never find out what's on the inside of this man because inside of this man is something trying to talk to you if you don't have the same Spirit of the one that's within here then you don't understand what I'm talking about amen that's why I understand people don't understand me I don't have no problems but I'm just saying if we got the same Spirit what's the problem right right now you go talk to a trinitarian you know right real quick that Spirit you talking to two ain't the right Spirit right okay watch what he says and therefore when we speak to each other we are quickly can understand right away whether we are Christians or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit we talk from you see that it vibrates on one another that whether we are Christians or not therefore we have never seen each other remember brother bandam saying that there was like a vibration come to him and he knew it was the right Spirit or not come to him and you ever talk to somebody and you just didn't you just something just just didn't feel right you know well there's one thing about it it's either God or the devil one so you know it's it's one of the other no problems but just for a second cuz you know how I preach I'll end this part we'll take it up next Wednesday I believe Jesus the flesh was a creation and if that's the only body that God ever had only body he ever will have because that's a one membered body it's not talking about the bride of Christ being his body because we are but we're a multiple form of that that's why I was trying to get you to see where he said Son of God and Son of Man see there in Daniel because one is the Son of God in a one form the other is a multiple form all right you see I believe when that baby was born there 2,000 years ago we called Jesus I believe what the prophet said that in body he was a man he say in Soul he was God then he'll say in spirit he was God I believe that you see that way you don't have eternal sunship and a mess up in your Doctrine because that way you got it right when Jesus said if you seen me you seen the father there's not another body anywhere can manifest God like that I don't care who we are who we think we are and what we think we're doing right it won't work see when that baby was born the soul and the spirit of almighty God came into that body amen and walked in that body upon this Earth that body is my brother that body is my Advocate amen that body is my healer that body gave his life to be a sacrifice but that body is all will ever see of God because he declares himself to be there and see that does away with all you River Jordans and the doctrines of people you know that he wasn't God until this and then he became God and the Bible said he was born Emmanuel I've got a quote at home laying a that we talk about Body Spirit and soul of Jesus Christ because you see God can't be seen that Spirit can manifest itself in a form and you can look at that form and see whether it's God or not because it will always follow the word that soul that comes into us by a new birth will always declare God God as to being the one true amen and living God see it takes all of these forms for us to understand let's stand right takes all these forms for us to understand many forms that he has with the one God Amen the one God that walked the shores of Galilee and there in that man he said if You' seen me you've seen the father Phillip he said because inside of this body is the soul and the spirit the very life the very being the very character the very nature the very all of God is here standing before you and that way you're not Oneness because you see that Son of God had to start way back y and work its way down to there to be the right one can you see that you can't see God but yet if he'll just declare himself if he'll just manifest himself you'll see what we got brother 138p spiral book 138p spiral book anybody got a need the alar is open you see that sun declares brings him out into the open to where you and I can see him Moses was able to see a form of God in the burning bush he was able to see him in many forms but he wanted to see him face to face in other words he wanted to see him more real than anything thing it had ever been before he says you can't do it see we are of one world and he's another one he had to condescend into this world to be able to give us an understanding of what it'll be like the Bible says when we'll get over there we'll have a body like unto his but just remember it won't be his body it be mine then it's talking about my body that I'll be living in right my body I'll be living in your body you'll be living in and see that's why we're a new creation that's right go ahead am my hope is buil on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteous th dare not trust the sweetest FR but holy Le Jesus name Rock stand all ground sink just come let's pray and let's see to the nness seems to hide his face I rest on his changing Grace in every high and stormy Gale my anchor hold in the on Christ rock all sink all ground is sinking is and his blood support me in theing flood All Around My Soul gives way he is all my open on Christ all ground his sinking sand all ground is sinking sand he shall come with trumpet sound oh may I in him be found dressed in his rightous for to stand before the on Christ sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand my hope is built on nothing Jesus blood and I dare trust the sweetly on Jesus name Christ no one realiz you believe you father I rest on his unchanging Grace in every High anybody else sinking sand oath is cover you know that desire of our brothers so we just ask you to come on the scene now and just make it manifest let everything work out for your honor and glory and for what you would have to be done in the things because we believe you and we thank you in Jesus name anybody else stand the throne on Christ the solid rock I Stand All of other ground is sinking s all other ground is sinking s amen I just hope you'll go home and pray and say well you know maybe I'm not understanding but you'll open it up to where I can because I'm simply talking about one true and living God made manifest in a many membered form called The Bride of Jesus Christ and to see that we can understand why it talks of the things that it does you haven't never read the Bible to where you know it's I'm pretty sure it's in the songs of Solomon but he describes his little girlfriend you ever heard brother Brown's definition of his first girlfriend it was something like legs like a jbird something like a swan and neck like a swan how would you like to be described like a bunch of goats coming down off of a mountain well that'd be something would it you go around tell everybody in the country get get on Facebook my husband says I'm like a bunch of goats that's what God says about you see it's according ording to what your thinking is to them the most beautiful thing that David maybe could see was a bunch of goats coming down off of a hill he wasn't looking at him like a bunch of stinking bats and you know all kind of things he saw something beautiful read the songs of Solomon that'd be a good thought for you by the time we get into the next message read the songs of Solomon and listen to what it's talking about sometimes it's confusing because you can't hardly figure who's doing the talking but you know look and see how he describes it gowake my love said he lookth through the lattice and says my heart failed cuz I think it used there something else you see we look at the Bible as being what we think is the word of God but do we look at it as talking about us and what God thinks about us and his description of us and his description of you in Revelations one is you got a white face and you got hair like wool and you got just and feet like br you know that's the most beautiful thing he could think of but it don't look too pretty to me that's why I ask you to draw it I don't look like a pretty woman I dare say brother Bob you better not go home and tell your wife that she looks like what brother Brandon said his first girlfriend look like right but to him it was beautiful you know right amen I've always got in trouble talking about my wife and I said if you got an old nag you always got a brag on that old horse cuz it ain't worth two cents but I said if you got a real good th bread then you don't go around all over the country bragging on her because everybody knows she's a th bread she said but you don't have to ref H to me as a horse well to me that's a beautiful picture got a lot of things involved in it never pray for Wade this weekend and ministering and all just pray that the Lord we bless remember the fellowship meeting not this coming weekend but the next one at brother Lor so we'll be leaving 10 10:30 something going over if you want to go with us let us know we'll travel together and eat together fellowship and have a good time time father we thank you for this day in your love unto us thank you for Grace thank you for all things we just ask you Lord to open up our eyes that we may see Lord what you think about us and look into your word and find ourselves therein forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey remember all of the sick among us Lord you know the physical needs that we have so we pray that you would just bless each one in Jesus name amen you dismissed all ye Saints of light Proclaim Jesus the light of the world life and mercy in his name Jesus
