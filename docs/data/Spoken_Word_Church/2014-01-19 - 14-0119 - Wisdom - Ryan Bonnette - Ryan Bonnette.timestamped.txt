[3:21] amen amen good morning good morning
[3:26] we're going to talk now on wisdom that's
[3:29] on
[3:30] now it may come as a surprise but
[3:33] sometimes
[3:35] i'm prone to being quiet
[3:37] so last sunday could anyone not hear me
[3:40] that's what i thought
[3:42] okay
[3:43] so especially when i'm reading y'all
[3:45] interrupt me and tell me if i'm getting
[3:47] too quiet i'll move this down we're
[3:49] going to see about getting the mic down
[3:50] here okay bob sometimes
[3:53] cause i'm kind of talking down when i'm
[3:55] reading especially so i'm real likely to
[3:57] get quiet
[3:58] okay we're going to talk about wisdom
[4:02] if you have your outline we're going to
[4:03] start with number one
[4:06] there are two types of wisdom
[4:08] worldly wisdom and god's wisdom
[4:12] i'll go ahead and read these definitions
[4:14] i have
[4:15] uh
[4:15] from the hebrew lexicon uh wisdom is
[4:19] skill as in war
[4:21] and administration
[4:23] shrewdness prudence and religious
[4:25] affairs
[4:27] and then um
[4:29] in the greek lexicon it's the the word
[4:31] is sophia which is
[4:33] broad and full of intelligence
[4:36] used of the knowledge of very diverse
[4:38] matters
[4:40] the wisdom which belongs to men
[4:41] specifically the varied knowledge of
[4:43] things human and divine acquired by
[4:46] acuteness and experience and summed up
[4:49] in maxims and proverbs
[4:51] the science and learning
[4:54] the act of interpreting dreams and
[4:56] always giving the sagest advice
[4:58] and the one i like the most here is
[5:00] skill and discretion and imparting
[5:03] christian truth the knowledge and
[5:05] practice of the requisites for godly and
[5:07] upright living
[5:09] yes if i may make a suggestion if you
[5:11] hold your paper up like this you'll
[5:12] project over to her oh okay
[5:15] i've got a lot of people you have your
[5:16] paper when you have your head down
[5:19] your voice tends to go down okay maybe i
[5:22] can just hold this yes
[5:27] put your nose in there
[5:28] that's right
[5:33] supreme intelligence
[5:35] such as belongs to god
[5:37] also to christ the wisdom of god is
[5:40] events in forming and executing councils
[5:43] and the formation
[5:45] and government of the world and the
[5:47] scriptures
[5:50] okay
[5:52] now part a 1a
[5:56] these two types of wisdom were first
[5:58] introduced and made available to mankind
[6:00] in the garden of eden the two trees the
[6:02] tree of life and the tree of the
[6:04] knowledge of good and evil we're in the
[6:06] midst of the garden
[6:08] but adam and eve were told not to eat of
[6:11] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[6:13] evil
[6:14] okay
[6:15] and now last week we were talking about
[6:16] parenting
[6:18] see god was a good parent even back then
[6:21] he was a good parent to adam and eve and
[6:22] he told them
[6:24] not to touch you know not to partake of
[6:26] that tree not to eat of it
[6:28] lest you die
[6:29] he knew what would happen to him he
[6:30] didn't have to tell him you know he just
[6:32] told him you know you would die but he
[6:34] didn't have to tell him all the things
[6:35] that they would lose and everything that
[6:37] would happen
[6:38] he just told him don't touch it and they
[6:39] should have listened okay but eve uh
[6:41] listened to the devil's reasonings and
[6:44] and then adam knowingly walked into that
[6:51] okay
[6:53] part b
[6:54] the tree of life was the source of god's
[6:56] wisdom
[6:57] when adam and eve took of it they gained
[7:00] wisdom pertaining to the things of god
[7:03] wait excuse me it'd already be a yeah
[7:06] yeah okay
[7:07] pertaining to the things of god by this
[7:09] tree they could live forever
[7:13] okay
[7:15] this excites me to think about you know
[7:17] god before the world i always you know
[7:19] brother wade is big on genesis 1 26 i
[7:21] guess that's his favorite verse he's
[7:23] always talking about that genesis 1 26
[7:25] man what excites me is
[7:27] back before that elohim god dwelling
[7:29] along with his attributes the elohim the
[7:31] self-existing one that had all of us in
[7:33] him and had all his attributes that he
[7:35] wanted to unfold himself and express
[7:37] himself
[7:38] and i love to read that volume one of
[7:40] the cld book the questions and answers
[7:42] on genesis those first few
[7:44] pages there where he's talking about
[7:46] elohim and out of him came up logos and
[7:49] then he began to speak and like a child
[7:51] playing for his father's door doorstep
[7:53] that just thrills me to think about how
[7:55] much power you know god had in him and
[7:58] he began to unfold and come down to a
[8:00] lower form where we could comprehend him
[8:03] and
[8:04] in him back then was wisdom and that's
[8:06] what i like to think about
[8:08] this wisdom that we're trying to protect
[8:10] of today that god's wisdom that was one
[8:12] of the things in him
[8:15] see
[8:16] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[8:18] evil was the source of worldly wisdom
[8:21] in their partaking of this tree mankind
[8:23] fell away from god losing the title deed
[8:25] to the earth and to eternal life
[8:30] okay
[8:32] and the breach between the
[8:34] seven churches and the seven seals in 63
[8:36] 03 17 in the evening
[8:39] brother banner said now the forfeited
[8:40] title deed is now in the hands of the
[8:42] original owner almighty god
[8:45] the title deed to the earth and to
[8:47] eternal life when adam forfeited it and
[8:50] satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[8:52] it went back to its original owner god
[8:54] himself
[8:56] and skipping down some the title deed to
[8:58] eternal life abstract title deed to
[9:00] eternal life when adam forfeited it for
[9:02] wisdom
[9:04] and instead of faith it went back to the
[9:06] hands of the owner almighty god
[9:11] he lost everything adam did he should
[9:13] have you know like said he should have
[9:14] listened to god to his parents he should
[9:17] have just done what he was told and
[9:19] and uh but anyway i'll stay back off the
[9:21] parenting subject now
[9:23] let's see
[9:24] oneness
[9:26] and 620211
[9:28] what was the first thing that caused eve
[9:30] to disbelieve god's word it was because
[9:33] satan promised her more wisdom
[9:35] you will be wise you will see
[9:37] now you see the human race is always
[9:39] reaching after something
[9:41] and eve was reaching after more wisdom
[9:46] okay
[9:47] 62041 wisdom versus faith
[9:51] now
[9:52] when i first thought about teaching
[9:53] about wisdom the first thing that came
[9:55] to my mind is listening to that message
[9:56] wisdom versus faith and i began to think
[9:58] well i'm talking about
[10:00] one top list and brother branham was
[10:02] talking about how
[10:03] wisdom is contrary to faith so what's
[10:05] going on so i listened to that message
[10:08] and
[10:10] uh began to realize there's two
[10:12] different kinds of wisdoms they talked
[10:13] about wisdom versus faith i'm talking
[10:15] about wisdom versus wisdom the wisdom of
[10:18] the devil versus the wisdom of god
[10:21] so don't be confused about the title of
[10:22] that message
[10:24] he's talking about
[10:26] a bad wisdom versus faith
[10:29] okay um
[10:32] and so the wisdom that i want you to get
[10:34] straightened out on before we start
[10:35] there is a wisdom of god a wisdom of god
[10:38] is stay with his word okay that's god's
[10:40] wisdom stay with the world
[10:43] to every jot until you know
[10:46] but satan in his wisdom
[10:49] tried to twist the word so that's the
[10:51] wisdom
[10:52] i'm speaking of there's a certain amount
[10:54] of faith that goes with satan in order
[10:56] to accept satan you got to believe satan
[10:59] so there is a perverted faith to a
[11:01] perverted thing
[11:02] and anything that would try to twist the
[11:04] word of god
[11:06] to make it say something that it doesn't
[11:08] is the wrong spirit
[11:10] see offering wisdom against god's wisdom
[11:14] can everybody hear me
[11:16] okay
[11:18] wisdom versus faith again this is
[11:20] paragraph 197 of the same message wisdom
[11:23] as satan was presenting to her said you
[11:25] shall not surely die see let it's trying
[11:28] to make the word say something that it
[11:30] isn't so
[11:32] that's what wisdom is today oh brother
[11:33] how we carry on that seminary schools of
[11:35] theology that's their very nest
[11:38] that's their grassroots is trying to
[11:40] make god's word say something that it
[11:42] doesn't say
[11:44] and then paragraph 2 36
[11:48] now see
[11:49] then as soon as she did that accepted
[11:51] wisdom with the word and wisdom was
[11:53] contrary to the word you understand amen
[11:57] see if wisdom is with the word and
[12:00] proves to be with the word
[12:02] and the word produces itself by the same
[12:04] thing then it is the word
[12:06] but if wisdom is against the word
[12:09] and not with the word but trying to find
[12:11] something to add to or take from it it's
[12:14] of the devil
[12:17] now i've got my pages
[12:19] my notes out of order here so
[12:22] okay
[12:24] uh in the second seal
[12:26] 6303-19 he said and if he's infinite he
[12:30] is omniscient if he's omniscient
[12:33] then he's omnipotent amen he's got to be
[12:35] that to be god
[12:36] see so he you can't say he learned more
[12:39] he didn't learn more he's the very
[12:40] fountain of all wisdom
[12:42] our wisdom here come from satan we
[12:44] inherited it from eve from eden
[12:47] where we swapped off faith for wisdom
[12:49] eve did
[12:54] okay
[12:58] now back to the outline
[13:03] number two
[13:05] these two types of wisdom are are still
[13:07] available to us today
[13:09] life and death are still set before us
[13:11] you don't have to turn i'm just reading
[13:13] one verse okay deuteronomy 30 19
[13:16] i call heaven and earth to record this
[13:17] day against you that i have set before
[13:20] you life and death blessing and cursing
[13:24] therefore choose life that both thou and
[13:26] thy seed may live
[13:28] so we see we still have the two trees
[13:31] before us and we can we eat off of you
[13:33] know like that indian brother said when
[13:35] he's born again he said in here two dogs
[13:37] you know the white dog and the black dog
[13:39] and the one that we feed the most wins
[13:42] so we protect over the tree of life
[13:44] and
[13:46] see part a
[13:49] when we choose worldly wisdom as adam
[13:51] and eve we too will separate ourselves
[13:53] from fellowship with god and bear evil
[13:56] fruit in our lives
[14:02] a pool of bethesda in 1950 oh wait a
[14:04] living and dear friends
[14:06] don't you know that worldly wisdom
[14:09] is the thing that destroys the world in
[14:11] the garden of eden there were two trees
[14:13] one of them was the tree of life
[14:15] when man eat from that tree
[14:17] he'd live forever and the other was the
[14:19] tree of knowledge which was the tree of
[14:21] death which was the tree of sickness
[14:24] and later in that message he said god
[14:26] destroys nothing
[14:28] man destroys himself by worldly wisdom
[14:30] the first conflict that ever come into
[14:33] the world was because that somebody was
[14:35] seeking after worldly wisdom
[14:37] instead of simple faith in god
[14:42] i going to turn to proverbs 8 and we'll
[14:44] get to that here in just a few minutes
[14:46] we're going to read that whole chapter
[14:47] if we have time
[14:50] uh god's power to transform in 65 on 9
[14:53] 11 which it's all right to have wisdom
[14:55] but if the wisdom is contrary if the
[14:58] wisdom isn't correct wisdom from god
[15:01] divine wisdom
[15:02] and becomes natural wisdom i don't care
[15:04] how much science we have and what more
[15:06] or education it's of the devil i'll
[15:09] prove it to you the lord willing in a
[15:10] few minutes stop the devil civilization
[15:12] is of the devil i just got off got
[15:15] through preaching on that all the
[15:16] culture in the earth all powers of
[15:18] science and everything is of the devil
[15:20] and scot goss
[15:22] it's his gospel he preached the devil's
[15:24] gospel
[15:25] of knowledge
[15:26] in the garden of eden
[15:29] and he has took that knowledge perverted
[15:31] knowledge contrary to the word and will
[15:33] and plan of god
[15:35] and now he has had six thousand years to
[15:37] do just exactly what god did only in a
[15:40] perverted way
[15:42] and took the same amount of time to
[15:45] bring his own eden in
[15:47] now he has got an eden here on earth and
[15:50] it's filled with wisdom knowledge
[15:53] that was his gospel at the beginning
[15:54] knowledge wisdom science
[15:58] okay
[16:01] uh
[16:02] before we read that scripture
[16:06] let's see
[16:07] 2b
[16:08] uh num letter b on your outline
[16:11] did i already read b
[16:13] i'm getting old i don't remember like it
[16:14] used to
[16:15] when we choose god's wisdom we again
[16:17] partake of the tree of life and thereby
[16:20] yield fruits of holiness righteousness
[16:22] peace
[16:24] and all other good things of god that's
[16:26] right
[16:28] proverbs 8 1 like i said we're going to
[16:30] try to read this whole chapter
[16:32] with a few comments along the way
[16:35] so
[16:36] you see
[16:37] through this whole chapter wisdom is
[16:39] personified throughout
[16:40] as
[16:42] to me that's showing that god or that
[16:44] this is the wisdom of god and that
[16:47] i actually have a question on that i'm
[16:49] not going to ask you a question i'm
[16:50] supposed to be teaching
[16:52] but
[16:53] you know i believe god and his wisdom is
[16:55] him you know i believe in a
[16:57] condescending form but
[16:59] that's the question i have so anyway
[17:02] so
[17:03] i don't want to say something that's
[17:04] wrong
[17:05] verse one does not wisdom cry and her
[17:08] understanding put forth her voice
[17:11] see sometimes we think god is mute we
[17:13] think you know you have to really listen
[17:15] to god and you have to really be humble
[17:17] and walk soft and you do it's not that
[17:19] god is mute he talks pretty loud but we
[17:21] just don't listen
[17:23] right and you know everything declares
[17:25] god all nature and everything that you
[17:27] see the zodiac the pyramids everything
[17:29] you and like i was talking about last
[17:31] sunday our relationships
[17:32] are with our parenting and our marriage
[17:34] and things everything declares god we
[17:37] just need to my brother like my god
[17:39] tells brother dale sit down shut up
[17:43] just listen
[17:46] all right verse 2 she standeth in the
[17:48] top of high places by the way
[17:51] and the places of paths of the past
[17:54] she crieth at the gates had the entry of
[17:56] the city at the coming in at the doors
[18:00] unto you only and i call and my voice is
[18:03] to the sons of man
[18:05] see wisdom speaks now in first person
[18:08] throughout the rest of this chapter
[18:10] o ye simple
[18:11] understand wisdom and you fools
[18:14] be ye of an understanding heart
[18:17] now i like what he says there oh ye
[18:20] simple
[18:21] uh
[18:22] understand wisdom see god has to reveal
[18:24] the word unto debate such as we'll learn
[18:26] he's hid it from the eyes of the wise
[18:27] and prudent right yeah so it's to the
[18:30] sample
[18:31] here verse six for i will speak of
[18:33] excellent things
[18:35] and the opening of my lips shall be
[18:37] right things for my mouth shall speak
[18:40] truth and wickedness is an abomination
[18:42] to my lips
[18:44] all the words of my mouth are in
[18:45] righteousness there is nothing forward
[18:48] or perverse in them
[18:50] they are all plain to him that
[18:52] understandeth and write to them that
[18:54] find knowledge i like underline the word
[18:57] plain in my notes here because
[19:00] we always say things are deep you know
[19:01] and like brother dale is always accused
[19:03] of being a deep preacher it's really us
[19:05] because we don't understand something
[19:07] that's what we call deep yeah we
[19:08] understand it it's simple
[19:11] that's where brother dale earns this
[19:13] nickname of being the deep preacher i
[19:14] guess because people just don't
[19:16] understand what he's saying they need to
[19:17] sit down and listen for a few years and
[19:19] yeah right yeah what are you saying
[19:21] um
[19:23] let's see
[19:25] thank you receive my instruction and not
[19:27] silver and knowledge rather than choice
[19:30] gold
[19:31] see wisdom and knowledge go hand in hand
[19:33] wisdom is required
[19:35] to use knowledge you know there's
[19:37] i think a few quotes i came across and
[19:38] studying i don't have them right here
[19:40] with me but what brother branham talked
[19:41] about you have to have wisdom to know
[19:43] how to use your knowledge because these
[19:45] are
[19:45] in the nine spiritual gifts and it's
[19:48] what second one i think of the nine
[19:50] spiritual the nine gifts that uh you
[19:52] have to have wisdom and then you know
[19:55] how to use your knowledge
[19:58] for wisdom is better than rubies and all
[20:00] the things that may be desired are not
[20:02] to be compared to it
[20:04] i wisdom dwell with prudence and find
[20:06] out knowledge with of witty inventions
[20:09] the fear of the lord is to hate evil
[20:12] pride and arrogancy and the evil way
[20:15] and the forward mouth do i hate
[20:18] counsel is mine and sound wisdom
[20:20] i am understanding i have strength
[20:23] by me king's reign and princes decreed
[20:26] justice
[20:27] by me princes rule and nobles
[20:30] and all the judges of the earth i love
[20:32] them that love me and those that seek me
[20:35] early shall find me
[20:37] riches and honor are with me yea durable
[20:40] riches and righteousness these
[20:42] durable meaning you know they won't pass
[20:44] away worldly riches will pass away but
[20:46] not the word of god not this wisdom
[20:49] we're talking about
[20:51] verse 19 my fruit is better than gold
[20:54] yea than fine gold and my revenue than
[20:56] choice silver
[20:58] i lead in the way of righteousness in
[21:00] the midst of the paths of judgment
[21:02] that i may cause those that love me to
[21:05] inherit substance
[21:06] and i will fill their treasures
[21:09] the lord
[21:10] capital l ordeal elohim
[21:13] the lord possessed me in the beginning
[21:15] of his way
[21:16] before his works of old
[21:20] i was set up from everlasting from the
[21:22] beginning wherever the earth was
[21:25] when there were no depths i was brought
[21:27] forth when there were no fountains
[21:29] abounding with water
[21:31] before the mountains were settled before
[21:33] the hills was i brought forth
[21:36] while as yet he had not made the earth
[21:38] nor the fields nor the highest part of
[21:40] the dust of the world
[21:43] when he prepared the heavens i was there
[21:45] when he set a compass upon the face of
[21:47] the depth
[21:48] when he established the clouds above
[21:50] when he strengthened the fountains of
[21:52] the deep
[21:54] when he gave to the sea his decree that
[21:57] the waters should not pass his
[21:58] commandment when he appointed the
[22:00] foundations of the earth
[22:03] then i was by him as one brought up with
[22:05] him
[22:06] and i was david his delight rejoicing
[22:08] always before him
[22:10] rejoicing in the habitable part of his
[22:13] earth
[22:14] and my delights were with the sons of
[22:16] men
[22:18] now therefore hearken unto me are ye
[22:19] children for blessed are they that keep
[22:21] my ways
[22:23] her instruction
[22:25] hope you hear instruction and be wise
[22:27] and refuse it not
[22:28] blessed is the man that heareth me
[22:31] watching daily at my gates waiting at
[22:33] the post of my doors for whoso findeth
[22:35] me findeth life and shall obtain favor
[22:38] of the lord but he that sinneth against
[22:41] me wrongeth his own soul
[22:44] and all they that hate me love death
[22:47] chapter 9 is also about wisdom
[22:50] but we will
[22:52] skip that one for sake of time
[22:54] um
[22:56] the second seal excuse me investments in
[22:58] 1962 11 24.
[23:02] remember it's the word that makes it
[23:04] right
[23:05] that was settled at the nazia council
[23:07] they took the other side the old
[23:09] prophets went back to their places with
[23:12] the truth
[23:13] you'll never kill it it's going on
[23:15] that's right
[23:17] see men scratch their heads and wonder
[23:19] just come to god if a man lacks wisdom
[23:21] let him ask god god reveals all things
[23:24] and makes the scriptures fit together
[23:27] notice
[23:34] okay um i'm trying to read my
[23:36] handwriting here
[23:40] okay i gotta write more slowly i want to
[23:42] read a verse or two out of first
[23:44] corinthians you don't have to turn to it
[23:46] because i'm just gonna skip around first
[23:48] corinthians 2 7
[23:50] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[23:52] mystery even the hidden wisdom
[23:55] which god ordained before the world unto
[23:57] our glory
[23:59] which none of the princes of this world
[24:00] knew for had they known it they would
[24:02] not have crucified the lord of glory but
[24:04] as it is written i have not seen nor ear
[24:06] heard
[24:08] neither have entered into the heart of
[24:09] man the things which god has prepared
[24:11] for them that love him
[24:15] okay first corinthians 1 19 for it is
[24:17] written i will destroy the wisdom of the
[24:19] wise and will bring to nothing the
[24:21] understanding of the truth
[24:22] where is the wise where is the scribe
[24:25] where is the disputer of this world hath
[24:27] not god may foolish the wisdom of this
[24:29] world
[24:31] for after that and the wisdom of god the
[24:34] world
[24:35] thy wisdom knew not god it pleased god
[24:38] by the forcedness of preaching to save
[24:40] them that believed
[24:45] okay and colossians 1 19
[24:48] for this cause we also since the day we
[24:50] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[24:52] and to desire that you be filled with
[24:54] the naught with the knowledge of his
[24:56] will and all wisdom and spiritual
[24:58] understanding that you might walk worthy
[25:01] of the lord unto all pleasing
[25:03] being fruitful in every good work and
[25:06] increasing in the knowledge of god
[25:09] okay
[25:11] and
[25:13] let's see
[25:15] and then now uh from psalms 111
[25:19] you often go ahead and actually turn to
[25:21] uh my last scripture which is james
[25:24] three
[25:28] while you're turning there psalm 111 the
[25:30] fear of the lord is the beginning of
[25:31] wisdom a good understanding how all they
[25:34] that do his commandments
[25:35] his praise and birth forever
[25:39] proverbs 1 7 the fear of the lord is the
[25:41] beginning of knowledge but fools despise
[25:43] wisdom and instruction
[25:46] the fear of proverbs 9 10 the fear of
[25:49] the lord is the beginning of wisdom
[25:51] and the knowledge of the holy is
[25:54] understanding
[25:56] proverbs 15 33
[25:59] the fear of the lord is the instruction
[26:01] of wisdom and before honor is humility
[26:04] and then proverbs 4 verse 5 give wisdom
[26:07] get understanding forget it not
[26:09] neither decline from the words of my
[26:11] mouth
[26:12] forsake her not and she shall preserve
[26:14] thee
[26:15] love her and she shall keep thee
[26:18] wisdom is in the prince wisdom is the
[26:20] principle thing therefore get wisdom and
[26:22] with all thy getting get understanding
[26:28] okay
[26:30] james 3
[26:33] uh
[26:34] verse 14
[26:35] but if you have bitter endings and
[26:38] strife in your hearts glory not and lie
[26:41] not against the truth
[26:43] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[26:45] but is earthly sensual devilish
[26:49] for where in being and strife is there
[26:51] is confusion
[26:52] and every evil word
[26:54] and then verse 17
[26:56] but the wisdom that is from above is
[26:58] first pure
[26:59] then peaceable
[27:01] gentle and easy to be entreated full of
[27:04] mercy
[27:05] and good fruits without partiality and
[27:07] without hypocrisy
[27:10] uh does anybody have any questions
[27:12] or answers
[27:13] or comments
[27:18] so you follow
[27:30] actually i got seven more but this is
[27:31] one
[27:32] that i thought i might come back to
[27:36] god's power to transform god can write
[27:38] god wrote the ten commandments with his
[27:40] own finger he wrote on the walls of
[27:42] babylon once with his finger he stooped
[27:43] down and wrote in the sand one time with
[27:45] his banger god could speak i can read
[27:46] gotham right
[27:48] god is the fountain of all grace and
[27:49] power and of all divine wisdom
[27:52] is in god
[27:54] so therefore
[27:55] knowing that he is the only creator
[27:57] there is there is no other creator but
[27:59] god satan cannot create at all he only
[28:01] perverts what's being created but god is
[28:03] the only creator
[28:04] therefore he created by his word
[28:07] he sent his word
[28:08] to all the seeds that he had placed upon
[28:11] the earth
[28:13] he formed those seeds by his own word
[28:15] and there was nothing else that could uh
[28:17] make the seed out to make the seed out
[28:19] of he had placed them and they were
[28:21] beneath the water he just said let there
[28:22] be and that was that
[28:24] um
[28:25] let's see
[28:27] okay that's it you're dismissed okay
