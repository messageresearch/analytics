========================================

to the next one called knowledge let's read second Peter one Simon Peter servant and Apostle Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so who is he talking to Christians people that are born again at Faith right down there where it says faith in the bottom of the pyramid Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so this is what this is going back to you know 10 or 15 this one's not going to start turn on the past we're on number 24 so now being on number 24 number 24 so back about number 12 or somewhere in there we talked about this scripture according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life your natural life living here on the earth and godliness and that's to be more like God cuz the statute of a perfect man is to be more like God so what Paul Peter's telling us is this is going to affect your life and your walk with God all right so even in normal life you're going to have troubles but there are certain things that you can do to keep you out of that deep pit what we were talking about there in in proverb so through the knowledge of him see through knowledge so that the next one coming up is knowledge through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given which is a gift unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature all right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith all right remember what we said add to what you believe that's what faith is Faith is what you believe in add to your faith virtue now we talked about virtue for the past five or six Sundays and when you we know that virtue is strength you must have it to be able to give it and you must know you have it to be able to give it cuz you know what you need some Inner Strength yourself all right it's not just that people around you need strength you you need that inner strength yourself but you have faith in your virtue you never lose Faith you add to what you believe virtue your faith in your virtue makes that thing work everybody understand that your faith you got to have faith that you've got virtue if you don't then how can I draw from it if if if you don't think you got it Peter knew he had it so Peter said so go Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee right remember we were talking there about about that Peter didn't have enough money probably to buy him a sandwich so he knew he didn't have enough money to send that guy set on the ground to a doctor so he said Silver and Gold Have I number but such as I have in other words he don't he didn't have anything in his billfall but he had an inner strength and he knew that but such as I have not not not hold on a minute let me go pray hold on a minute let me get my life cleaned up hold on let me go do this no it was an instant moment he was walking by and honestly I don't think that Peter had a vision saw the guy I believe Peter was just walking through the gate you understand what I'm saying he he was just walking through the gate and this man was the one that was wanting to receive so we know God works on both ends he put Peter in that direction but I don't think Peter was impressed because if he was Peter would have stopped himself but he was walking by and the person said hey I require arms of the or I need I need some money in other words um Peter just stopped and said I ain't got no money but what I do have I'll get you in a condition where you can go find you some money where you can get up and walk and that's what happen so this all a strength of character because of coming where it do I always that once you become again you need strength you have listen you have the divine nature of God in your soul at a new birth right but remember the quote that I showed you last week where brother rown said faith alone's not going to do it say boy Faith Al no I got it it's we had it on the screen faith alone will not do it what faith alone will not make you a complete statute of a perfect man you got everything you need inside there but you got to have confidence that it's in there it's always there you don't get a little of the Holy Ghost and then you get a much more you get all you need for your journey but what we've already said is that our memory reason conscious affection and Imagination the things that affect us in this world we kind of put it in a put it in a shell so it can't work right because Martin Luther like we were talking about Sunday evening Martin Luther had the same holy ghost that William brandham had right Martin Luther had the same holy ghost that you got but you and I have are supposed to do the Greater Works Martin Luther had all these virtues in the Holy Ghost but he just believed that just shall live by faith he drank a beer sat in the pub smoked the pipe right because the Sanctified life had not been revealed to him the only way you're going to get any of these virtues is out of here and coming through the filter of your mind from a preacher don't tell me you do it you we fil everything through our our brain we do right our brains don't have the Holy Ghost our soul has the Holy Ghost but our brain is the connection without our brain we're dead and through our brain we listen to what brother Dell says or what other ministers say and we filter that through our spirit right right and then it gets down into the salt somehow brother brand said he could even explain it remember I read that quote Sunday I believe in the service somehow God gets down in there and changes that Soul drives out the unclean spirit and gets you all cleaned up cuz there's darkness in there until the light comes but when the light does Come Peter says you got to add something all right virtue you get from what yourself and from others all right same thing with knowledge knowledge the Holy Ghost is knowledge it's the knowledge of God the Bible say the knowledge of the Lord will fill the Earth the Sea and the sky why cuz we'll all be there we'll all have a pure mind but remember Eve's mind was polluted first that's where Satan got her first then the rest of the act happened but she was polluted in Her Mind by accepting something that God told him not to do CU that's one of the very first things you see in knowledge if You' have looked up the scripture is Genesis 2 and9 that the Lord made the Lord God made grow every tree that is Pleasant the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil tree of knowledge and that tree did most of you did you look up your your definition somebody got a definition of the word knowledge sister Trudy sing it out loud you saying out loud can't you talk well the one that I really like most means the awareness or famili familiarity gained by experience of facts and situation that's good cuz listen this knowledge in the pyramid is not whether you know algebra trig calculus brother brandham said an ignorant and unlearned person Peter right couldn't even write his name but he received the Holy Ghost see that's hard for us as intelligent people in this age of intelligence which this is the age of intelligence we've got so much I mean if you want to look up knowledge you know you used to you'd have to go through the dictionary and you'd have to go through the world book and psychopedia if you didn't have one you had to go find one now you can take your phone out if you had one you take your phone out punch in knowledge Google and guess what you you got all kind of definitions of the word knowledge all right so knowledge has increased the Bible say but I like this one that word in the Hebrew lexican is De a de means perception skill understanding wisdom and I like this one because this is the one that knowledge to me knowledge know in the pyramid means one thing is earn knowledge in this pyramid has nothing to do with human knowledge you already got human knowledge most of us graduated school most of us can write our name Ray has to help Kathy a little but it's okay but that's all right you can get a stamp with your name on if you ever write it one time you just start stamping stuff you'll be honest but you know though she's got the Holy Ghost I believe she does well you know what she a she and I are not the smartest cookie in the you know or smartest knife in the drawer but you know what that don't matter that don't matter to God I'm not I don't have a lot of I got a lot of knowledge but a lot of times I don't have a lot of good Common Sense I'd rather have a lot of good common sense then I had to have a lot of knowledge you know a s plus b square equals whatever that is I I've learned it in school but you know what never used it since I got out of high school not one time unless I wanted to go in that field and you know yall know I love algebra and trig and calculus and all that stuff so but you know what I've never had to use it any any s so that kind of knowledge every time we hear this word knowledge don't think of any kind of human knowledge right that I've went to college or that I'm smarter than this one or I know more than this one that has not one thing to do with that knowledge in the pyramid now an illiterate person can set up here today now illiterate means you can't write your name that's what they said about Peter brother B said it's the new birth can be understood or the word of God can be understood by an illiterate person why because he listens to what's being said and he applies it to his life to me that's very to me that's very simple what what bothers you and me is is our human knowledge brother Dale said it Wednesday night I hope you caught it he said a lot of you are trying to figure things out you try to figure things out guess what that does that stops God right there because God don't want you to figure nothing out right he don't even want preachers to figure it out that's what the problem is with the preachers out there in the message now that preached false Doctrine they've tried to figure it out because that ain't Godly knowledge God's knowledge can't be error so God's knowledge is much higher God's knowledge is one word and that's discernment because Eve lost her discernment in the garden up here and guess what she was coequal with Adam so God spoke to her right hello God spoke to her just like he spoke to him brother Brown said before the fall they were co-equal cuz remember if he's a type of Christ and we're a type of the Bride the Bible says in Romans 8 that you and I are what hires and Joint hires with Jesus Christ Our husband so what God's trying to do is is not not get us to where Jesus is here and we're here join ours is back to co-ee equalness right that's what brother R said and I believe that Eve didn't have a problem until she let what her own knowledge she should have said no but her discernment was wrong that's why you sisters can't preach in the pull pit you deal a lot with emotion Eve deal deals with emotion and she deals with a lot of things that she was trying to to do sometimes you know brother Ramy we try to help God and God don't need our help amen he just needs us to discern from Good and Evil that's why it says right here now let's read this and out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight Genesis 2:9 and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now let's read that the tree of discernment of Good and Evil God didn't want you to know evil he wants you to know good and you know what in Genesis 2:9 remember he keeps on going he said okay from the Tree of this you can eat but from the Tree of that you can't eat why'd he tell them that he knew if they got over here on this side what the Bible say they would be as Gods wise remember That's what Satan said you'll be as God you'll know all things all right but that's going into the human knowledge not God's knowledge so in a nutshell whatever whatever definition you looked up is fine as far as knowledge as far as human knowledge but if an illiterate person that cannot read or right if he can receive the Holy Ghost what does he do he just simply believe he simply says God I accept you for what you said I can't read somebody's have to tell it to me but you know even when brother Brown he had a seventh grade education but you know what you remember he said he said that um who was it hope or one of them used to read the Bible hope used to read the scripture and then he would preach brother Brown had a hard time reading seventh grade education you're really not getting where you understand what you read good okay or I didn't so this knowledge here I want to get that out of your brain it is nothing to do with human knowledge nothing I'll go back one more time brother Brown said an illiterate person now we don't meet too many illiterate person this day and time and it's not it's not an excuse to be illiterate I don't want you to be but sometimes our human knowledge gets in place of our spiritual knowledge and we try to figure things out now there's nowhere in the Bible that God says figure you need figure things out right he said you have the mind of Christ now if we have the mind of Christ that mind will come to us and we'll understand things okay but that word knowledge even perception is used and skill but even discernment in natural knowledge we need for natural things on on Earth Earthly things but the Heavenly things you got to discern first thing it's not going to be whether you discern what whether you need to go to this job or that job or this job or that job your number one discernment as a Christian is is to discern right from wrong according to the Bible that's it he don't require anything else look at brother brandham he we all you know we all took the day Ramy course and all those things and and we think well the prophet of God he he surely God helped him manage his money remember he lost his first chair cuz he couldn't make the payments on right they repossessed his chair and that was in the 30s but you know what it was something he desired as a human he wanted that chair but you know what God thought so much of that repossessed chair remember when he went across the curtain a time what was sitting there what was sitting there his chair right remember his chair his dog his horse so even in even in our you know you even in our human knowledge um you know several people that have made millions in in the world have went bankrupt several times they don't tell you about that they just tell you about the successes but a lot of people went bankrupt so what I'm saying is is you need a lot of knowledge just to get in this world and and be successful but sometimes don't let our success you know I'm going to tell you like I told that brother one time before if God he said God gave me this job well he couldn't be on here Wednesday he couldn't be here on Wednesday night and mostly on Sunday I said God didn't give you that job you stay out church on Wednesday night because of your job you're back slid I tell the whoever I was working for and whoever I do I told when I started working for Jacob first time I said I said I need to be off at 4:00 on Wednesday cuz I'm going to church and I ain't one of them that gets there 5 minutes till 7 right I get there an hour early so I want to be there early but you know what if a man will honor you God honor him anybody and you say well I'm afraid to are you afraid to ask somebody for your soul that's your soul you're talking about not not some stupid dollar you'll never be successful if you work on Sunday and Wednesday night you'll never be I promise you you will never be successful and I'm sorry that may hit half of you but you know what on Wednesday night then a lot of people here they could be here but I'll guarantee you if there's something going on special you'll be somewhere well I'm preaching now sorry but you know what Holy Ghost knowledge if you have Holy Ghost knowledge that's what the Holy Ghost knowledge will tell you it'll tell you to be in church not sing it home your knowledge may tell you different but the Holy Ghost will not tell you to stay out of church right he will not now I know some of you live a long way away and that's okay but that's why we got the internet but if you that live around here I'm telling you you'd make the stinking ball game if it was on Wednesday night or whatever but you know what people we got this is the statue of a perfect man this is what we're called to in this end time Martin Luther may not have been called he's not wasn't called to what we're called to God winked at his SM smoking a pie and drinking beer you can't do that and get by now that Spirit has gone it's left here right because of sanctification when you come to a Sanctified life when I come to a Sanctified life a lot of people say I know I got the new birth CU I quit doing this quit doing this quit doing this Bible says the unclean Spirit goes out at sanctification you should have stopped that at sanctification that don't mean one thing you got the holy ghost that just means that God come in and drove that un spirited out problem is we don't fill it with the Holy Ghost and we let them seven guys come back I mean one guy come back with seven of his friends and you're seven times worse why you're sitting in church thinking everything's cool and okay but you'll show I mean you're by your fruits you'll be known see discernment see don't you think that Brother D he's got discernment Beyond even what you know brother brandham had a discernment that he could tell you the thoughts and intents of your heart and brother Dale may not have that discernment to tell the thoughts and intents of your heart thank goodness me either but I promise you one thing if you're not here all the time at church if you got all these excuses and you got all these problems he knows what's going on he knows you need a birth or you need a regeneration I mean that's just just to me that's just common sense I think God's brought me to a knowledge that if I don't go to church I'm either lost or backslid one of the time and if I continue to do it I'm lost it's just as plain it's just like I told you about finding knowledge in Google Google God every once in a while Google God not naturally I'm talking spiritually cuz here is what this is God's Google book right here right this is if you need something in Google you what do you do you punch in the what you need and Google will bring it up bring it from all over the place and bring it to one spot right now if you need something from God what do you go to you go to the book and you say well I need knowledge well hey from what we're talking about now um there's 168 reference es to knowledge in the Bible yeah more than virtue 168 because knowledge to me is one of the most important things to to get you on up into that statue of a perfect man why do you need to have it early same thing with virtue why do you need to have it early you know what I'm talking about God just didn't place these seven things in in in just random order they're placed where you got to have faith first then you got to like Sister Lisa said just a wonderful point and a point I've never thought of you got to find that virtue in you first before somebody else can find it in you you got to find it in yourself that's why that statute of perfect miny brother brandham says he says you come all this way up here and you you don't have the Holy Ghost yet well people go crazy over that thinking you don't get the Holy Ghost till you get up everywhere say holy spirit but keep reading he said that Holy Ghost actually Seals Everything in cuz he said hey you get right up here to Temperance somebody cut you off and make you mad and you blow up about it well you know right there God hadn't seal Temperance in all right I tell you when we get brotherly kindness we're going to have fun with it cuz you got to love your neighbor and your enemy just as you love your own self and that ain't just U FAL love well it's easy to love somebody that loves you but how about loving somebody that literally hates your gut and you can love them with the same love you had if they agreed with everything you said and they were your best friend that's pretty wild knowledge though let's get back to knowledge just for a second we're going to get back to it and read some script scriptures we'll go ahead and go upstairs here real quick but listen discernment when we say Knowledge from now on use that word discernment cuz what you are doing with not with the Holy Ghost knowledge is that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is still excuse me is still here now brother brand said the tree of life is Jesus Christ so you have that in here everybody got that you have the Tree of Life in you as the new as the new birth all right but that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was not done away with in the garden it's still here what it's Choice it's a free moral agency just let me preach on Sunday afternoon you're still a free moral agency a agent after you're born again that's where these come in cuz if you're born again you're a child of God but you may not make it to knowledge or Temperance or patience or all those things like that but you're a son remember one son stayed at home one son went out in the world right this one may have a little more knowledge than this one but the other one came back showing that he was truly a son so knowledge is discernment brother brandham you'll I'll bring the quotes how many times do he said have you prayed over the matter how many times he said and that's may not be verbatim but he says have you prayed over the situation have you prayed over the matter or do we just jump into something see that has a lot to do with Temperance too but you got to have knowledge which is discernment to discern from Good and Evil cuz you know what good and Evil's right here a tell you to stay home God tell you to come to church so if you listen to one you know who that guy is it's the devil so because you know why you go back through now you got to run it through the filter of the word what does the word say forsake not the assembling of yourself together and more what the problem is is people don't believe I was telling them out wi from people don't believe this is the end time cuz the Bible says and more as the day approaches so if you go to church less now than you did 10 years years ago you're lost let me just put it that way you're you're lost or you're just totally the back you can't see what's going on but I need to be here minister or no Minister I need to be here to get my filling every service I come to church just like I'd go anywhere else I prepare we get ready right like I said before you know you head off to a a doctor's appointment you get there 30 minutes later you you just don't go now you don't do that you're not going to miss that doctor's B that doctor's got knowledge don't if you don't know how about a little Holy Ghost knowledge all right let's keep if you didn't look up knowledge I'm giving you one more week look up knowledge cuz I'm going to ask each one of you next Sunday your definition of knowledge and you too FR and and Monique I'll call you from Jamaica and find out all right thank you
