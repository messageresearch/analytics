TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I'm filling in again up here for brother Bob today and uh just be in prayer for them traveling okay all right and I just want to give a quick little review of my last lesson it was uh about uh love lesson number eight I believe was and that one was about daily bread uh just a broad overview because I know I might have lost everybody in those examples first I want to say I wasn't bragging about driving so many miles and so much money that have made at philadel anything like that all I was simply saying is when you do something that's kind of big a big daunting task you know if you just uh approach it from just a daily bread just a a little bit of a a day a little bit each day and the word of God is no different if you just approach this V thing of this word of God and the message the Bible so much uh reading material and things that we have and sermons and sermons to listen to but if you just do a little every day that was my whole point in that lesson if you missed anything what I said got caught up in those little examples I gave just that's all I'm asking just a little bit every day and that won't be so overwhelming take it one day at a time also I made the comment that Gabby and I are an anomaly what I was really meaning by that I'm not saying we're something special it's just that we we were on this course in life she was in foster care in all kind of different churches long ways away from the message I was born and raised Baptist going down this course of Life long ways away from the message but the predestinated plan of God intercepted our paths and brought us here but I'm not belittling those who were raised in the message and saying that your life is any less of a paradox or an anomaly when you come to Christ and you're not writing pastor's coattail anymore or parents coattail and you get a revelation for yourself you're just as much of an anomaly you're something that you're a you're a paradox if I can use a word of brother bham that you're going along this course in life right in pastor's coattail then one day the Lord turns to you and calls you by name and says who do you say I the son of man am so even raising the message you still have that have to have that experience and I know y'all have many of y'all have so I wasn't trying to belittle anybody I was just using that an example just shows to me the predestinated plan of God that it wasn't me or you that came here predestinate eternally it was the word of God that you desire now that you didn't desire at one time and it crossed your path and then you begin to uh be attracted to that amen so that was a review of last lesson this is a love lesson number nine part nine the Divine Romance so when reading a story sometimes it's uh let me go ahead and pray over this lesson I didn't prayed yet Heavenly Father pray just bless this little lesson let it be a bless blessing to your people here today Lord and those that hear it on the internet and just help us all in our walk with you Lord to be encouraged in this and just to take it to heart and just to walk a closer walk with you and fall in love with you that's what we want to do in Jesus name amen so when reading a love a story just in general a story sometimes it's good to sort of zoom out and look at the broad picture you can get caught up in all these little details so to see this Divine Romance go back to the beginning in God's mind look to the end and see the redeemed manifested bride behold the Lamb's wife and you can see this whole entire great big picture of a beautiful love story the most beautiful story that's ever been written Revelation 21 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vs full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither and I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife I believe it was brother Wade that mentioned this book a long time ago I don't remember maybe several months or a year ago and gabin and I bought this book uh at the recommendation of brother Wade or whoever said it I can't remember the Divine Romance what brother Wade by Jee Edwards I highly recommend that getting that book um it's one of my favorite books now and in that uh the author Jean Edwards he simply taken this whole like I just said this whole overview of this great love story from an angel's perspective because angels have been there pretty much the whole time you know viewing all this that's happening there are these bystanders and they bystanders watching this whole thing beh and beholding the whole picture and from their perspective what must they have seen and it's just kind of a narrative of behind the scenes about this great love story between Christ and the bride and I absolutely love it and several times in the book I would stop look back at the the author and say is this a message believer I mean because it's just so there's so much uh in there so much I guess you say Revelation so it's so rich I just don't know how uh a nominal Christian could have gotten so much but just goes to show you he's there too you know dealing with people even in nominal churches cuz they they get see a lot of things too so um so romance means uh a feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love I'm going to pause there for a minute because while I'm teaching this lesson there's there's two sides to all these love lessons it's you and your spouse those of you who are married but then it's also us and our Lord the bride and bridegroom uh the body of Christ in Christ there's this feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love and all I want to say is an as an encouragement uh you who are married keep that alive don't ever let that romance die never it really is alive and and burning strong and passionately at the beginning when two people meet and fall in love but you can keep it going it absolutely doesn't have to stop after 20 30 years of marriage it can keep on going so that's a a excitement and a mystery a and a feeling of love for or a strong attraction toward another person and the courtship behaviors undertaken by an individual to impress Express those overall feelings and resultant emotions uh feeling or action that expresses a romantic or love like attraction between two people it can also refer to the courtship behaviors that people use to express their feelings romance can begin as an infatuation that deepens as people get to know each other I say it should definitely not just can it should begin as that and deepen as you get to know each other more that should intensify that romance should not only perpetuate it should actually get greater over time romance has been the subject of many creative Endeavors including art music plays songs and books how about the word of God you know that's in this inspired by this romance between Christ and the bride that's his love letter to us inspired love letter so another thing I want to say about that going back to that before I go to the next slide here we're wired that way our creator wired us this way you know to have deeper and deeper love for something mostly for him but you can apply that in marriage too use that to your advantage in your marriage and say that we're wired in such a way to where we more the more we get to know each other and think about how much we appreciate one another as husband and wife the more we'll fall in love and have this infatuation and this romance that gets greater and not weaker so elements of romance this is not an all-inclusive list this is just just random things I listed here there's I'm sure you could name more things to add to this list but all I'm trying to do is show you the evidence of this romance that's been going on and throughout the whole lesson kind of meditate on these things as I bring out the examples of them so there's uh first of all there's a longing for a companion okay at the start or even before the beginning of a romance before the two meet there's this longing for a companion so like yeah say you and your spouse before you met each other you men had a longing for a wife and the women had a longing for a husband and to start a family and all that that was their first you know and Christ in his mind had this Longing To to have fellowship and have a bride and be um you know be manifested in this bride and then there's the first meeting there's an attraction there's a falling in love courtship and communion a proposal an engagement a wedding a new home I know it's really small writing but intim intimacy and there's a union um I wasn't ready to go on think of your journey all right now go back in your mind you who are born again you can go all the way back to even your childhood your first conscious memories when you were in your maybe toddler age even think of the first time that God began dealing with you however he did it and whoever he did it through and think of that being that God was beginning to woo and coup if you want to say it like that brooding over your life calling to you from a very young age and just for an example it was for me my parents raised me in church but my grandma my dad's mom in particular she was the one that set this example by reading the Bible and praying with me as a little bitty boy when I'd stay with her sometimes me and my sister and she would get down this old woman when I was 4 years old she was about maybe 60 so that was old to me I thought wow how impressive this elderly woman getting down so sincere and praying on her knees in front of me and my sister and reading the Bible to us and letting us pick stories out of the Bible for her to read to us that was God and my grandma cooing to me beginning to woo me and that would come back when I was 15 and I started reading the Bible and praying every day well see that was God beginning to deal with me there with what I would need later in life to be one of the best things that's ever happened to me as daily Bible reading and prayer so think when you were a little child and you think well maybe it was a Sunday school teacher a school teacher could have been your parents could have been a relative of any sort that began dealing with you from a very young age that was this God in the starting this love story beginning to infiltrate your life and calling to you how and when did you fall in love with with him this is where brother Louis's lesson last Sunday and his sermon Wednesday was so profound to me because in all my years of being in uh in church and reading the Bible never I've always I've heard about law and Grace and all that and never seen Grace quite like he brought it out in Mercy that when God forgives you it causes you to fall in love with him how can you not when you get forgiveness versus just law saying Thou shalt not Thou shalt not you say all right I'll try I'll try to be good try to follow the rules but then when he forgives you of what you did you can't help but fall in love with him that's part of this whole love story that was so profound I've never seen it that way so the love letter is of course the Bible um these are some of the elements involved there's the there's the word of God the Love Letter there's the bride and groom in this great story there's the future home there's so many gifts especially Christ himself is God's gift to us brother B said and then we are God's gift to Christ love gifts we'll get into that here in a minute even our Natural Body and our Natural Life are God's gifts to us you know even our natural breath we take I mean think about the human body how fascinating is it's a self-healing body and it needs help from medicine and doctors sometimes but by and large most of what you come down with the body heals itself God made a self-healing body think of all the things the love gifts he's given us how could you not fall in love with him from the Rapture brother B said just reading the Highlight now you can fellowship with him that's what he wants he's longing for Fellowship to be worshiped if your life always was an attribute of God and you're just a mimic of Christianity there'll be millions and billions of them they'll just be mimics of Christianity but talking about this all these instances it shows brother bam saying that God wanted Fellowship it was there and we had a longing for something that was there so we're going back to that last one of those slides where I said there's a longing for a companion to start with there's that longing impression of Christianity brother Banner said holy spirit CS to you and says sinner your God's love gift I want to make love to you won't you do it why don't you just open your heart and say Yes Holy Ghost here I am I'm here I am I don't care what anyone says holy spirit I want you I want you you're the one I'm looking for so on both sides there's this longing skip on down to the yellow and God sent his big bulldozer down out of heaven and he cleansed the old alley out yes sir the old Shackled the Shacks gone the tin cans are gone the rubbish is gone talking about sanctification now it's all pushed out into the sea of forgetfulness and he tears it off there it is forgiveness and you will fall in love with him as a little boy 12 years old neighbor boy introduced me to pornography one of the worst things ever happened to me in life and that's what caused me to realize I was a sinner and needed salvation CU I thought before then I was pretty good kids at school would say you know Ryan you never get in trouble you're always getting bragged on by the teachers and I thought maybe they're right maybe I'm pretty good not neighbor boy brought over porn magazine solve that problem I realized yeah I need salvation so something me started yearning I cried and asked God to forgive me then I started to fall in love but then I I had this root of evil in me for several years three more years after that that I struggled with pornography 13 14 15 years old I didn't know about sanctification it was two more years till I came in the message so what happened in that time I started reading the Bible 15 years old started reading the Bible every day it it lasted a few more months maybe six more months and pornography was gone for my life forever 25 years now it's been gone dead dumb devil gone well sanctification started taking place the washing of Water by the word how could I not love him all those years when I struggled and I said God I want to get rid of this thing I love you and I hate that I'm giving you cause for being on Calvary and I'm hurting you Lord that Ling me was drawing me for a higher for sanctification that I didn't even know existed I I prayed I said Lord can you take it away is that even a thing can you even do that I didn't even know there was sanctification can you Lord is that even possible should I be asking that can you take it away from me and profanity using C words I said Lord I don't want to it's hurting you can you take it away he said yes you read the Bible read the word and I and I didn't even know when I started reading that those things were starting to fall off I didn't know that that would happen I read the Bible cuz I wanted to know him I read the Bible because I didn't want to be a hypocrite I had that and still have that thought that if you claim to be a Christian but you don't read the Bible you're a hypocrite that's that's still my conviction to this day if you're going to profess to be a Christian you should read the Bible you should know what the Bible says you know and I still stand by that I don't mean to hurt any feelings but I'm just saying you know Christians read the Bible Well that started happen happening but it was that love that started when he said I forgive you and I said what I still can't get rid of it and he said and I'd ask for forgiveness again and pray the sinner's prayer again he said I forgive you how could you not love him after that who is this MZ that God came down and became flesh and died the death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get it into Fellowship um God God loves Fellowship that's what he made the man for the first time was for Fellowship so the attraction this is again some of the elements here of the romance that we're talking about this great romance 1 John 4 you know is all about love love comes from God for God is love or the for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not know knoweth not God for God is love skip on down verse 10 here in his love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins and if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us still 1 John 4 God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him we love him because he first loved us so still on the attraction tell me therefore let's back up this is Luke 7 Jesus is talking to Simon he invited him over you know to his house and said I've some much saying to the Simon he said Master Sean there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 p and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most remember talking about forgiveness causing love Simon answered and said I suppose he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged then he talking about the woman washing his feet with her tears kissing his feet she'd been forgiven she loved him so much cuz she had been forgiven for so much she was such a sinner like I was with that pornography such a dirty and he said I forgive you wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little now we get into these gifts I didn't mention that in that list but there are gifts involved um when two people fall in love I I showered Gabby with gifts uh when we began to fall in love and and um so it's a common thing you know that you want to give to the one you're in love with invisible Union of the bride of Christ you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace the wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own so just get that image in your mind of these gifts that God gave us there are so many gifts all right what a privilege to even be considered to be the bride of Christ it's the highest calling to mankind to be the bride of Christ Christ manifested in the form of his bride we just have to attach ourselves to him by the new birth reading the love letter so the Third Exodus when the church can get in such harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they're going to be one that goes back to my list there talking about the romance and how Two Become One ultimately in unity love gifts greater than pmon here Jesus was God's greatest gift Jesus was God's loved gift to the church and the church is God's love gift to Jesus think of all the gifts that we have from God life itself natural life and and eternal life healing salvation Comfort anything and everything you think of we need is summed up in Christ God's gift to the church the bride in this great romance is Christ and it's even more profound and mindboggling to think that we're his gift you know when Gabby and I got married I didn't really care for any gifts from her she was my gift you know I still like to shower her with gifts but I don't care she does give me gifts you know from time to time I don't care if she does or not she is my gift with a from Serv we see Jesus with a broken heart come around the altar weeping what are you you are God almighty God you are his love gift that he has chosen you and given you to Jesus Christ so love gifts this is Romans 8 for I reckon the suffering in this present time not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed in us so much that God wants to reveal in us what a gift that is to Jehovah jar number one brother benam uh quoted this last time like said when I filled the Holy Ghost like you people did I walk through like a big arcade everything there belongs to me so many gifts I'm an heir of every bit of it I'm an heir of an arcade I like to find out what I got when I become a Christian I wanted to know what I own so if I had an arcade I'd go through there and pull out the drawers and look over here and see what's over there something seem to be a little up high get me a step ladder and climb up to it i' find out what it was something seems beyond my reach I get on my knees and start praying and rise up to it it belongs to me God promised it Divine Healing the power of God all the miracles signs wonders love gifts belong to us I mentioned this last time I didn't read them all but um all the Mysteries they're being revealed in our time they're here ready to be delved into if we'll just study and pray and ask God to reveal them Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven of Israel's blindness of the end the translation of living Saints at the end of this age New Testament Church is one body composed of Jew and Gentile the church as the bride of Christ the in living Christ God even Christ the Incarnate fullness of the godhe had embodied The Mystery of the processes by which God likeness is restored to man The Mystery of iniquity and of the Seven Stars and the Babylon so many gifts of these Mysteries he saved for our day to reveal to us love GI is where the spirit said pick up the pen and write spoken words is the Original Seed from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word and the Virgin who knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas Divine so now we're talking about the future home you know when you when a couple is to fall in love and get married they've got to have a place to live well here comes that we know about the future home brother Brandon preached the Divine architect has designed a new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch a Divine architect has designed it for a Divine attribute that's been divinely predestinated by Divine God who is the author of a Divine Divine Life and what will that City look like think of it the impersonation of Christianity brother Ben said he built a great modern new home he's been brooding there beautiful lilies come up in the yard around there as skip on down to the other highlight as the Holy Spirit Broods he will bring forth love joy peace longsuffering goodness gness patience he'll decorate his house upright so Romans 5 for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for righteous man will one die yet prevention for a good man some would even dare to die but God commendeth or demonstrates his love for us in that while we're yet sinners Christ died for us um in Luke 4 uh this is where um basically I was just going to say in this slide that Christ left something for the church you know we're because we're uh part of him being manifested in the last day we're Christ in you know being manifested in the last day so in the temple he went in the spirit of the Lord he quoted the scripture and read the scripture of the scroll um the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and sent me to heal the brokenhearted to the um to preach Deliverance to the captives recovering of sight to the blind that Liberty them the bruised to preach accept we year of the Lord and then he closed the book and remember he stopped there but the rest of that back in Isaiah 61 is and the day of Vengeance to our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint them that mourn in Zion to give to them Beauty for Ashes and the joy for mourning and the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness so he stopped he fulfilled his part and left part to be fulfilled in the bride um I guess I'll go ahead and let the musicians come at this time if you don't mind I'm going to quote this from Brother Wade this is a pretty long oh sorry brother Wade brother Aaron this is brother Aaron a few couple I think it was uh couple months ago yeah June 12th the old things have passed away when we're talking about that divine order he was preaching about the divine order and we're still staying on the subject of you know passion and uh talking about the um romance so the old things have passed away so when you come into Christ you're under that because the promise is when you come into Christ you enter in that rest you know God come into that and he had a plan and a purpose everything was in divine order and when he came in then he sat down and rested because everything was working just the way God wanted it well then let me tell you something brother and sister we step into that same place where the we step into the divine order the same way when you come to Christ you're in divine order think of coming one becoming one with Christ it doesn't matter of every devil in hell comes against you when everything falls apart there's nothing there and it blows up there's nothing there and you don't know where you're standing what's going on there's a place to stand why because no matter what comes your way you're blessed in the Beloved we're sitting in Heavenly places I'm going to skip a little bit because there's a long quote everything is in divine order you got to put your trust in him walk the way he leads you if you just put your confidence in the word of God he justified me Sanctified me filled with the Holy Spirit brought me put me on the road that I'm supposed to be walking on I'm standing tonight on the divine order standing on the divine plan of God and you know what I can rest solely in that don't have to worry about anything that comes or goes why because there's a place to stand God wants us to realize who we are you don't have to worry about that see God who Satan really is Satan can only do what God allows him to do put your trust in him God's in control you go out uh when they were out at Sea and the ship was rocking everything looked like it was going to fall and they were ready uh the boat to sink said Lord you don't care we perish he wasn't worried he was in the back asleep we're so afraid because this terrible Storm is Coming wow because he was at rest he didn't have this if we have that same Spirit the same one that was on that boat we were in we're in him we walk shores of Galilee he didn't have any fear because he was one of his then you know what you don't have to worry about that God's Place For Us in the divine order that'll be where I'll stop there but just just keep in mind this romance that's going on there's so much there's many more things to that but anyway God bless you thank you amen [Music]
