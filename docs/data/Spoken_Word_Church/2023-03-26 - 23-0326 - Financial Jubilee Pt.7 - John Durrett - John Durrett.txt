========================================

three languages amen see everybody's back for more amen praise the Lord well let's just open up in a word of prayer this morning precious Lord Jesus we thank you Father once again Lord for giving us this opportunity Lord to come to your house Lord Jesus and oh God just to Fellowship Lord with your people Lord God and we pray you bless this day Lord bless the Sunday School of service Lord Jesus and oh God just speak to all of us Lord Jesus as we're on this journey of Life father God and we just need you to guide us and keep us Lord bless this topic and be with us this morning we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord so I thank the Lord the lot has fallen on me again to give another Sunday school a lesson as uh brother Bob put it so um we're going to get right into it by the grace of the Lord so I'm sure from the last Jubilee Sunday school you've been spending you've been saving you've been hopefully paying off some debt and hopefully you also been giving so um that's a it's a daily thing as said before that you know money is one of those things that we we do daily in between service some of us are going to go out and buy lunch some people are going to eat lunch downstairs so which money is always a factor that's that we have to deal with but I love Jubilee and we'll go to the next slide because Jubilee always says you know no matter how long they had been in bondage how long they were supposed to stay there when the Year of Jubilee come of the Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free and as we talk about financial Jubilee remember we're not just talking about money we're talking about all of God's promises that's there for us there for us if we wanted but again the world has many many things set up to prevent us from going on with the things that we hear in God's word but money is one of those things again we can all relate to from the youngest to the oldest we can relate to it those who are handling money well you got kids coming up you got grandkids coming up so all of these lessons need to continue and they need to see us be an example so they can see because the world and the Devil he's setting examples he's setting things up that they can see and they're looking at our lives how are we handling this thing called money next slide and our prophet in 1965 way before I was born many of you were probably young or some of you were born after this he said clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said get all things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen praise the Lord keep that always in your mind as we live our lives that we should have clean lives paying our debts owing no man just the way Jesus said getting all things off of our hands so that we're ready we're ready for whatever the Lord has for us and we know the promises that he has for us and our Prophet is saying something is fixing to happen and this is amazing to me you know way before I was born this quote was out there of course I didn't know it to very very late but it was out there just as the word is out here all the promises is still there and we need to be able to practice these things so we can believe God's principles and practice them so our faith can grow by the grace of the Lord next slide I'm gonna hit on some of the principles a couple of the principles that we've talked about and kind of put a little context behind it and share a little testimony with it so we know the principle and we know this and we we all know this in God's word plainly states that God owns it all he owns it all and if we just pause for a minute and we think that our father he owns it all right now and if we say that but to really get to where we're believing it we got to have something to practice on something that increases our faith that we can believe God truly owns it all our father really really does Own It All we have to manage his resources diligently that's that's what his word calls for for us to be diligent and diligent that word again it means characterized by Steady Earnest energetic and painstaking work just to keep something in order we got to manage what he gives us diligently remember money costs your time if you waste money you're wasting the time that you put in to earn that money be patient we know we heard that message last week about patience wonderful we have to be patient we have to give God an opportunity to work and avoid debt like a curse we got to avoid debt like a curse that's for sure if you go to the Old Testament it's a blessing for obedience God told Moses and he told the children of Israel he said the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give thee Reign unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shall lend unto many nations and thou shall not borrow and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail and thou shall be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord thy God which I command thee this day to observe and to do them amen now that was to Israel and we're spiritual Israel so we should be even greater than that you say well how am I going to lend to Nations well it's very simple when you put money into your bank account a checking account for example or a savings account the bank they take that money and they lend to other people that's how they make their money they charge them a higher interest rate than they would pay you and that's how they make their money so if you have money that you're saving in a bank account you can fulfill that scripture by lending to many and that's what God wants us to be he wants us to feel like we are the head but in order to do that we got to fight we have to fight our way through this and financially it's it's in his word of course there's many many scriptures but we got to be skillful fighters in the word of God and what he wants and of course I say all of this you know as if I I never made mistakes and sometimes when I'm talking to the kids and I'm all charged up and I'm like oh you know but I gotta step back and be graceful because I made many mistakes I learned this from the ground up my brothers and sisters from the ground up and I'm going to share with you my testimony of the biggest mistake that I made as I told you before we got into business we lost all kind of money I didn't know what in the world was going on I was paying my tithes I thought I was living right and here it was in 2008 the stock market and the housing market I mean went down my brother and I are just losing money left and right and I started saying Lord what's going on as I said before we we hustled we lost a ton of money but we paid it back and I started asking God like Lord show me what what am I doing wrong I remember laying in the bed thinking like Lord what am I doing wrong you know I we we were we grew up poor for sure and um as I said before you know God gave me an opportunity to go to college and that was all his grace that's part of my testimony I was um you know played around in school in high school I didn't do hardly anything we skipped class and my dad was a worker he's like hey just work y'all ain't gonna do good in school anyway you know you need to work and um so my brother he's a you know construction guy he worked hard I tried to hang with my dad and both of them out worked me out there I'm like I got to do something and um I went to uh we moved to a new school and I remember the principal telling me she said look if you skip school like how you've been doing you're going to jail you can't do that here and I'm like okay we're gonna we're gonna see what happened that day was very odd though the first class I believe was like the first or second day it was the last period of the day and the teacher that teacher was an English teacher very Stern teacher but some reason she looked at me and she said oh my God you you you're gonna do great you're gonna do amazing like I looked around like who was you talking to the principal came by the class that day she brought me in the hallway this teacher and said do you know this young man I still don't know what she was talking about the principal was looking at her like you don't know this young man but by the grace of the Lord that started something in my life that allowed me to just start doing well and did God just transformed my life I was able to go to college learned some things I thought I learned I started studying business and in college and got out of college and of course you know I'm making more money than I I ever thought I would make and got marriage to my beautiful wife and we're living life you know money coming in and money going out every day if we had a good budget I budgeted but I didn't know what I was doing everything came in everything went out and that lasted for years and I remember we started looking about we got a house and then you know we wanted to move to another neighborhood and let's go to the next slide and um they were building a new house and I was like yes I'm going to take care of my wife we're gonna get a new house man we're gonna Live It Up and we went to the house and I had no money again I was working and we got this house and I took out I told you a 40-year loan 40-year loan had two mortgages to pay for this home and this is one of the mortgages it was 302 thousand you know in Maryland a different price a different price range up north through 302 000 it was 6.375 interest rate 40 years all right and 1700 was the payment yes I thought yeah we could pay that I budgeted out I'm like yeah we could pay that and let's say hey let's get this house we're gonna be happy But as God started dealing with me and money and I started being diligent with his resources I started looking at this after we paid out all that business debt and I'm like Lord God you know what's going on and I start being diligent with the money that he was giving me and as I was looking at this and started really looking at what I had signed up for and I realized oh my Lord the interest on this loan is going to be 500 something thousand the total if I just let this thing stay as it is I would be paying 800 000 for a home eight hundred thousand five hundred thousand dollars extra that I never intended to sign up I just wanted this house I was thinking I was going to get 300 000 for this house but see you see how the devil he gets us into these vines that we're not thinking about it we're not planning on doing it I just wanted a house for my family but the Devil he's out there to take the resources that God has given us to be a blessing and take it and give it to Wells Fargo I mean I'd much rather give Terence a hundred thousand instead of getting Wells Fargo 500 000. don't ask for it brother Terrace but truly I instead of giving 500 000 extra to Wells Fargo what if I said God if I had that money Lord what would you have me do with it well that's what our father wants that's what he wants from us but thank God for his word that Jubilee it says no matter how long you had been in bondage or was supposed to be in bondage you could go free but I called Iran I would start an investigating I said you know here's the situation we got ton of debt I'm just paying bills living paycheck to paycheck started emailing anybody I could find and I remember one person saying hey look you need to get rid of this house you're in over your head and I'm like I do but I got a baby we had two kids I'm like Lord God what do we do but thank God for his grace praise the Lord for his grace let's go to the next slide so now the people today are expecting God to reach down get them by the neck say yes that's right you bring me out clean me up heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way he gives you the promise but you have got to fight for every inch of ground that you possess praise the Lord that's it he wanted us to fight our way through my mama so we started praying I started getting my wife and saying okay we got this situation we're gonna have to cut down on everything that we have I didn't know if we were going to sell this house or not but no matter what we had a 40-year loan 2007 2047 would be paid off if we kept what the world had signed us up for and I kept living my life and I could I could have just kept going on but after God starts showing me this stuff and I'm like okay we need to fight our way through we cut down and this is the same thing if you're in this situation or if you can start seeing what God has for you if you apply these principles you can see where he will take you mama so we started fighting cutting down stop eating out and these are hopefully you're getting principles as I'm talking through all of this cutting down we start saying okay instead of eating out like we used to eat out all the time and we would always be at restaurants and we pay for everybody it's like man we just living it up 300 200 I mean every Sunday was going out with somebody but after this we start cutting down my goodness we start saying hey we're going to have a budget I'll eat out fifty dollars a month you know that's it we're gonna enjoy that Mickey D's we're gonna Max it out with coupons but it tastes so much better I'm telling you when you know what you're doing and you're letting God lead you it tastes I mean it was like steak man you wanted every french fry to last I'm telling you but that's the gratefulness that start coming out if something broke we started fixing it because we're like hey we cannot spin anything extra we got a problem we got a 40-year problem on our hand we're in bondage praise the Lord Jesus and we started knuckling down selling things that we didn't need and just being diligent still enjoyed ourselves but everything we just cut down cut down we started using cash instead of credit cards and things like that sister Alicia would go to the store and yeah people gotta wait behind you as you take out cash and you count it out and something goes over instead of your credit card you slide it right something 10 cents go over a dollar thirty dollars forty dollars but when you cut down we had to do this just cash well we could still designate what we want we could still say Okay I want you know 300 in groceries every two weeks but let's hold it to that okay that's being diligent you can decide as a family what we're going to do together okay if your wife likes to shop she might want 300. well Brothers you may have to work a little harder do you want 500 but talk her down a little bit maybe but designate what you want to give and manage that that's how you start getting diligent and we did that by May of 2013 five years later still owe 240 thousand dollars still trying to make it fighting our way through by the grace of almighty God praise the Lord and this is where the grace of God comes in see he's our father he owns it all right as you start listening to him and obeying his principles he started adding Grace to it he gives you Grace you're still finding your way through but he's giving you Grace in your fight because he knows you will win that's the wonderful thing about our father right if you fight you will win if you're expecting to not fight you will lose you see that's he's letting that that that be known okay we have to fight our way through right every inch all of the promises we know we have to fight our way through by August of 2017 and and we see we still wanted certain things I remember saving for a fence this was a big thing my wife and I always talked about we wanted a fence in our backyard and after we got away from credit we started saving for those things so I finally saved up ten thousand dollars for a fence big yard like yes but this debt was stand right at me and I said Lord God okay I remember having a little conversation what do you think okay do you think we'll get this fence or put it on the debt and she didn't really think much she said oh well if you want to put it on a debt so once I got that green light I'm like all right I won't ask two times it's going on the fence it's going on the house I'm sorry so we take that 10 000 put it on the on the house brought it down like wow behind every loan there's something called an amortization schedule and it gives you the breakdown of every payment and every interest charge if you have debt I think that's a very important thing for you to have because it'll show you your interest costs so as I started seeing this interest cost at every extra payment I would make I would be saving something and I knew God wanted me to have this at Wells Fargo so if I could pay a little extra and and turn cut out some of that interest one extra payment I would save Seventeen hundred dollars a month one extra payment I would save Seventeen hundred dollars okay so as I started looking at five hundred thousand pay one extra payment it will cut down I would pay it started feeling the benefit of that Seventeen hundred dollars that God would have for me instead of me paying it off to Wells Fargo by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ his grace by August of 2017 I made the final payment on that house by his grace [Applause] by his grace so I stand Here believing what I'm saying it is impossible two hundred and forty thousand I don't make that kind of money by the grace of the Lord Jesus but by his grace and his grace adding to it blessing doing different things a job of bonus will come through and things like that and I would put it on the house forget it I didn't want to buy something extra I wanted to save that five hundred thousand dollars by the all grace of God and it's the same promises ever is for all of us let's go to the next slide he says if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe pay attention to these words whatever he will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you if you are Son of God you are daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there and I I stand here to say and that's what's happening even with this word this message that we have it's ours but our faith gets away from it gets away from is it really a Rapture does God really owns it all does he really my so you can see the fight that we're in brothers and sister we have to fight our way to get to where our faith can hold to these promises if not we already know we know what will happen although we're born again but we won't be effective but by the grace of God if we could hold on to it and our faith can grow in the smallest of things it will continue to grow so after seeing God do that in my life from Nothing by his grace you see it doesn't just apply to money my faith can anchor a little stronger like Lord you have these special promises for us Lord that we can speak worlds into existence it's not just a fable it's the truth we're going to seem crazy but we need some in our life to where we know hey you might think I'm crazy but I paid off a 40-year loan within 17 years it was gone that's crazy that's crazy especially coming from where I come from coming from both nothing but to see God come on the scene just to stand behind that faith it just increases your faith and as I shared with you the testimony my dad and how it's just so much because as you start holding on to God you as you start going to him for everything like Lord do you want me to use the money for this Lord this is another Avenue Lord what do you what would you have me to do and you're waiting on him you're fighting to wait you're fighting with the patience to wait even if you have the money you're like Lord would you want me to do this Lord you know do you want me to change a vehicle right now or wait a little longer you know and he'll balance those things out in your life each person he'll balance it out because he knows what he's expecting but we have to be in that spot where we're surrendered enough to where he can guide us through these things but again it's fighting to increase our faith run through some tips just to remember how to fight in the Book of Joshua let's go to the next slide remember you got to be strong and of good courage you've got to be strong and of good courage remember good courage is different from Bad courage bad courage would be I will apply for this credit card that's bad courage I will talk to the bank manager about the loan I'm gonna have the courage to do that no that is bad courage good courage is Lord I don't have the money father give me the strength to wait give me the strength be strong and very courageous observe and believe and do what his Prophet has told us all of this you can read in Joshua stay in the word meditate on it day and night remind yourself I Love Philip Philippians hey it says be anxious for nothing be anxious for nothing when you feel that anxiety coming up so Lord that word says be anxious for nothing but all things by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known to God and the peace of God that passes understanding so keep your heart and Minds through Christ Jesus that scripture is with me all the time because we live in a world brothers and sisters where anxiety and anxiousness is always there believe me as we fought our way through you know the starter would go out in a car or something happens and you know it's like man it's time to buy new car instead of get a starter fix but no I'm not gonna be anxious I had people at the job you know and by the grace of the Lord he gave me a good job I thank him for it John when you're gonna get rid of that old car I'm like brother I don't know but it still drives praise the Lord it takes courage takes courage you walk out there you see everybody else with their nice cars and you're like I could get a nice car but do I need it right now or is it other things God you want me to do well you know what you know they're going to just have to deal with me driving this minivan around for a while I know they would probably want me to be in something different but you know what hey they're going to be happy and I do this this is all the time Brothers this is this is the fight that we're in you know I walk out there I'm like why am I feeling embarrassed walking to the van you know why am I you know I'm like they're gonna have to just get used to it I'm not trying to impress anybody but this is part of the fight this part of the struggle because I want God to leave me not my emotions I want him to Lead Me amen and that's what we have to do even with his word we're gonna have to stand there more people looking at you like you're crazy you believe that you really believe a Rapture and you're gonna leave the Earth are you sure well yes I do I believe this is personal don't be afraid do not be dismayed by the grace of the Lord Jesus let's just go on we're going to go to the next slide a couple minutes and as we look in the word we can see the tactics of the enemy right he has Wilds he has tricks and the word wow means a devious or cunning plan or scheme especially one used to outwit an opponent or achieve an end employed in manipulating or persuading someone to do what one wants the devil has been doing that from the very beginning my brothers and sisters from the very beginning he haven't changed that tactic if he can't get you one way he'll set you up and that's what he's doing financially setting us up so he can rob us of the resources that God wants for us to have that he can use for his honor and glory and not only that but just to get to that point where we have that freedom in our life to be led by God and the wonderful thing about the Lord Jesus he is not going to hold back he's going to bless you he promises that but we got to learn to wait on him and not be fooled this little picture on there is this little girl she's a she's a young girl she says your first credit card use it wisely and she's looking like she's a young lady now I know she's being deceived amen that's what that's what the devil does you start feeling grown when you're able to get a credit card again I got my first VCR on credit at JC Penney's I thought I was a man I had arrived 200 and something dollars I recall for a VCR on credit praising the Lord are the parents gonna be proud of me my deceived but by the grace of the Lord he gets us through all of this next slide real quick be patient got to be patient through all of this Aiken the the interesting thing about Aiken if you read this chapter it says it's a sad we know it's a very sad story cost a man his entire family but if you read in Jericho of course when he took the spoil and they lost men in AI when they went to Ai and conquered AI do you know God told them in that city after Aiken had died and gone through all that he told the Israelites they could keep the spoil in that City I said my head he waited one more battle one more battle he could have gotten the spoil in the other city so God has these things for us but he knows why he wants us to wait and he will bless I see it I believe it he will bless if we learn to wait on the Lord by his grace as we fight to believe let's go to the next slide keep going to the next be the last slide keep keep going through we'll end on this note the musicians can get ready next slide keep going right here you guys know the story remember the story brother I'm told of the the elderly lady and her son was a businessman working in India and charity came by and they wanted to find out why this woman was living in this condition and she was probably stricken and someone turned her into the authorities and authorities came by and they said you know what is do you have anybody to help you anybody in your family that can help you she said well I got a son he's the sweetest young young man he's been over there for about 10 years and he's just um I can't tell him I can't tell him I'm in this condition and um they kept talking to her and said but you know he sends me the prettiest pictures she said I keep them in my Bible so across the floor they went the old mother and she picked up the Bible and began to lay them out they investigator looked at them she was a rich woman what were they they were Bank drafts from India they had pretty pictures on them where did she find them in her Bible she was rich and didn't know it where did she find it in the Bible you don't have to act like the world you don't have to go around all bound up you're rich where do you find it in the Bible you just looked it over and thought it was just a picture book true story but it isn't it's God's word you each one of us my brothers and sisters we are rich people beyond a shadow of a doubt but we gotta fight to believe this word the promises God has them all for us fight your way through fight for your children fight for your family remember we win if we fight fight fight every day you know brothers and sisters I come up here with a smile with joy but every day I'm fighting every day I'm fighting for the promises of God so keep fighting in Jesus name musicians foreign
