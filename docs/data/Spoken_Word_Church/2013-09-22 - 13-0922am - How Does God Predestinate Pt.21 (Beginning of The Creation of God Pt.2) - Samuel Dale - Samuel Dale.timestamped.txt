[2:31] you know vomiting the diarrhea all week
[2:33] long and brother vinnie's had it and
[2:35] everything is just going through so just
[2:38] pray one for another that the lord would
[2:40] uh
[2:41] take away all of these germs and
[2:44] conditions and situations and all you
[2:46] know inner doings but
[2:48] amen remember the lord willing wade will

[2:54] of trouble with her

[3:03] to watch uh the the services from there
[3:07] but just keep praying one for another i
[3:09] know there's a lot of sickness among us
[3:11] but he also said he sent his word and
[3:13] healed us
[3:14] so we believe that he is the healer
[3:17] right all right let's just pray then go
[3:20] right into our scriptures
[3:21] father we thank you for your loving your
[3:23] grace unto us we thank you for calvary
[3:26] thank you for all things and lord we
[3:28] pray that you would just help us to
[3:30] to understand the day and the hour that
[3:33] we're living and to be what you want us
[3:35] to be not what we want to be or desire
[3:37] to be but what you want us to be the
[3:39] lord just come among us now and bring
[3:41] your word unto us and then you say that
[3:43] you sent your word and healed us so
[3:46] bring forth the manifestation of healing
[3:48] into our bodies
[3:49] and thanks lord that we may be
[3:52] what you need to hear this world
[3:55] you don't have to have us but yet you
[3:56] chose it that way so we just thank you
[3:59] for doing it have your way now got each
[4:01] one forgive our sins
[4:03] because we want to stand complete in you
[4:05] and keep us now in jesus name amen
[4:10] romans 8.
[4:15] verse 28 and we know that all things
[4:17] work together for good to them that love
[4:19] god for them who are caught be called
[4:22] according to his purpose
[4:24] for whom he did for no he also did
[4:26] predestinate
[4:28] to be conformed to the image of his son
[4:29] that he might be the firstborn among
[4:31] many brethren
[4:33] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[4:35] he also called and whom he called them
[4:38] he also justified
[4:40] and whom he justified them he also
[4:42] glorified
[4:43] what shall we then say to these things
[4:46] if god be for us who can be against us
[4:49] now remember in the
[4:50] the third verse let's see
[4:53] uh
[4:56] where was that
[5:00] called when you predestinate be
[5:02] conformed the image of it you might be
[5:03] the firstborn among many
[5:05] brethren
[5:07] many brethren
[5:09] all right let's go to revelations 3 14.
[5:12] this is a message to this age that we're
[5:14] living in all right
[5:16] amen and unto the angel of the church of
[5:18] the lady of siam's right
[5:20] these things saith the amen the faithful
[5:22] and true witness the beginning of the
[5:25] creation of god you may be seated lord
[5:28] add his blessing to
[5:30] the reading of the word
[5:35] now we've been
[5:37] for quite a while
[5:40] speaking on
[5:42] you know how does god predestinate
[5:46] and we know that he predestinates
[5:49] by his foreknowledge
[5:51] foreknowledge is always first
[5:53] because we try to predetermine it
[5:56] without going by foreknowledge we make
[5:58] god a respect for persons and things are
[6:01] wrong and things
[6:02] uh i don't know what they've got up here
[6:04] that there's a cloth up here and on
[6:05] where it's to clean up something or
[6:07] somebody left it up here or what it is
[6:09] but we'll leave it laying there until
[6:11] somebody claims it
[6:12] you know
[6:13] it looks like it's
[6:15] it looks like it's been used some to
[6:17] clean up a board oh wade's got it for
[6:19] his chalkboard that's where it's at okay
[6:21] wade'd be taking the scene and he got it
[6:22] on chalkboard okay
[6:24] uh i wanted to find out about that
[6:26] but
[6:27] we've been talking about
[6:30] god predestinating by his foreknowledge
[6:35] not that he desired that certain people
[6:37] be saved and certain wouldn't
[6:40] but he knew by being infinite
[6:44] who would be saved and who wouldn't be
[6:46] saved all right now
[6:49] if that is anchored enough into our
[6:50] minds
[6:52] uh i'm you know i want us to
[6:55] think about it a little bit
[6:58] and uh
[6:59] you know we had to kind of rearrange
[7:01] wednesday because when we have company
[7:03] coming in i don't like to
[7:05] just
[7:06] run on you know
[7:08] i try to back up a little bit and
[7:10] try to help them as much as i can
[7:13] to to do so having company we kind of
[7:15] just
[7:16] preached a thought across
[7:18] of what we're talking about
[7:21] now this morning we're going to uh start
[7:24] going through some of what we said
[7:26] wednesday night but we're going to go
[7:28] through by showing the profit as he says
[7:31] it
[7:32] and doing because see
[7:35] uh you know i know you here understand
[7:38] some things but you got to remember that
[7:41] the service is going out
[7:43] that we're also responsible to try to
[7:45] help those that we can to where that
[7:47] they can not be just lost in what uh we
[7:51] would be saying but got to try to bring
[7:53] it and i found also in doing it that way
[7:56] that a lot of times we hear
[7:58] don't understand it that well so it
[8:01] helps to do that
[8:02] and it doesn't bother me for company to
[8:04] come in
[8:05] uh it really gives me a time to just
[8:07] kind of loosen back up a little
[8:10] from driving so hard
[8:12] because i want to help somebody else
[8:15] i want to be of a service to people to
[8:18] for them to be able to understand
[8:20] all right
[8:22] but god then would
[8:25] by being infinite
[8:28] then he would know who would be saved
[8:30] and who would not be saved
[8:33] and that way then it wouldn't be him
[8:35] choosing
[8:37] it would be us
[8:38] into choosing you know whether or not to
[8:41] accept
[8:43] now he has to give the infidel
[8:44] invitation because the bible says no man
[8:47] can come to god unless that he calls him
[8:50] all right so it's not just something you
[8:52] know that we're just haphazardly doing
[8:54] but still when he calls us we might we
[8:56] must make the the choice
[8:59] see many are called but few are chosen
[9:02] and why are they chosen because of the
[9:04] choice
[9:05] they make
[9:06] all right then we we want to keep that
[9:09] in our mind about foreknowledge to not
[9:11] just go to a foreign point or a
[9:14] predestinated point and try to hammer on
[9:17] that so much but yet to
[9:19] to uh
[9:20] get a better understanding
[9:23] all right then you remember what we were
[9:24] trying to bring out this past wednesday
[9:29] that
[9:32] when you talk about the beginning of the
[9:34] creation of god where we read there in
[9:36] in revelation
[9:39] we know that was the lord jesus christ
[9:41] and we know that the beginning of the
[9:44] physical body
[9:46] began in the wound of a virgin mary to
[9:48] be the beginning of the creation of god
[9:50] all right
[9:51] now because that would be a physical
[9:53] creation
[9:55] coming forth all right
[9:58] but yet still he's more than just
[10:01] to say it only applies to
[10:05] him coming into being in the flesh
[10:09] because we know that there has to be a a
[10:12] time that he was
[10:15] he was the beginning has to start
[10:18] and i tried to make the point there
[10:20] wednesday night if i could
[10:22] to get you to see that when we say
[10:23] beginning to us that means
[10:26] you know
[10:28] something
[10:29] getting started
[10:30] a starting point
[10:33] or we call it a creation
[10:36] it means a starting point to you and i
[10:39] but in bible terminologies it doesn't
[10:42] mean it that way
[10:43] see because john 1 says in the beginning
[10:46] was the word
[10:47] and the word was with god and the word
[10:48] was god well now where are you going to
[10:51] station that beginning as to be
[10:54] you know you can go back to genesis 1
[10:56] but then you can go back up in to the
[10:58] very mind of god and and bringing it
[11:00] down and and see that there's many
[11:02] things there to be able to understand
[11:05] but see we that's what my point was when
[11:07] you get your mind into a thought a
[11:09] channel
[11:10] of what i'm talking about
[11:14] that
[11:14] you know anything that has a beginning
[11:17] has an ending
[11:20] all right so then if you read that as
[11:22] the way we read it of john 1
[11:26] you say in the beginning was the word
[11:29] see you'd say well that beginning has an
[11:30] ending because it had a beginning
[11:35] you get me see that would be our human
[11:37] terminologies the human terminologies
[11:40] cannot be applied under scriptural
[11:43] forms and beings and and showing it
[11:46] right
[11:47] it simply means that there's a time
[11:50] something could not be comprehended it
[11:53] was there all the time
[11:58] then
[11:59] it's unveiled
[12:02] or
[12:02] whatever the word you want to use for it
[12:04] it begins to come down to where the
[12:07] human
[12:08] um being can comprehend
[12:12] so how can you comprehend an eternal god
[12:16] that even brother branham would use the
[12:17] word in the beginning
[12:20] before the eternal
[12:24] now
[12:25] what kind of terminologies is that
[12:28] before the eternal
[12:31] how could anything be before eternal
[12:33] right
[12:35] but to me he's emphasizing how eternal
[12:39] eternal is
[12:42] that no matter how far you go back
[12:47] you find god still to be there
[12:50] all right
[12:51] and that's what we want to deal with
[12:53] today to bring down a point to our
[12:55] thoughts and and we've been through this
[12:57] many many uh series is over the years
[13:00] that we've been speaking for 40
[13:02] something years
[13:03] about these things
[13:05] and if we kind of make it elementary
[13:07] just remember
[13:09] that uh
[13:10] some people hasn't heard it
[13:13] but also remember something else if you
[13:15] count something elementary you might
[13:17] want to be careful
[13:19] it might mean you don't understand what
[13:20] you're talking about
[13:22] so the best thing to do is just sit back
[13:24] relax and
[13:25] and say well lord i've seen that before
[13:28] now you help others see that
[13:30] you know
[13:31] but i opened it unto me too
[13:34] because that's what we need to do
[13:36] and keeping that away all right
[13:39] but now
[13:41] do you you see what i'm talking about it
[13:43] doesn't matter i don't ask you to
[13:44] believe what i'm talking about
[13:46] because that would be
[13:48] irrelevant
[13:50] i ask you to listen
[13:53] to what is said
[13:56] and then
[13:57] ask god to speak to you
[14:00] about what is said
[14:02] and that way then you have a part to do
[14:04] with it all right and you can see it and
[14:07] i i may even totally miss it
[14:11] you may catch it from what i'm saying
[14:14] and you might receive it and i might
[14:16] miss it
[14:17] and not even have it
[14:19] he said can that could be done yes it
[14:20] can be done uh i'll give you my word for
[14:23] it it can be done
[14:24] it's like i told sister birds that time
[14:26] when
[14:27] when i preached so hard on
[14:30] i come from god and i go to god and
[14:33] on the way home that night she said
[14:34] brother dale i see what you're talking
[14:36] about i said well good
[14:39] you know
[14:41] she said he was god all the time
[14:43] wouldn't he
[14:45] i said order to let you preach
[14:48] well that's what i was trying to do but
[14:49] i couldn't get it down in that
[14:50] terminology
[14:52] you know so then don't worry about it
[14:54] just just relax and have a good time
[14:56] listening
[14:57] all right but remember our point
[15:00] a beginning doesn't mean a starting
[15:03] point
[15:08] it it means that something that was not
[15:11] made known
[15:14] but yet it was dire
[15:17] all the components
[15:20] was in the garden of the
[15:23] computers
[15:25] electronics
[15:29] it was all in genesis
[15:31] all right
[15:33] television the prophet would say
[15:35] was in genesis
[15:38] all
[15:38] right but he said it was not
[15:41] comprehended
[15:43] right
[15:45] see until
[15:46] the fire swapped 50 years ago or
[15:48] something maybe a little more
[15:50] all right
[15:51] so then
[15:52] thinking about it that way we can see
[15:55] that
[15:57] the bible says there's nothing new under
[15:58] the sun
[16:00] the things that have been are and all
[16:01] etc
[16:05] automobiles was in genesis
[16:09] the airplanes
[16:11] but it was only the component parts of
[16:14] those situations or whatever
[16:17] all right but one day it was brought out
[16:19] into the open
[16:21] and we say we created a car
[16:24] we can't create
[16:28] we just put together the parts
[16:31] right
[16:31] so do you understand my my point of
[16:33] wednesday night
[16:35] all right
[16:37] something that's previously is dire
[16:42] but then it begins to be
[16:44] made known or unveiled
[16:48] to where we can see it and see that's
[16:50] the way god is
[16:54] he was god all the time
[16:57] but yet he began to unveil himself
[17:03] coming down that you and i could
[17:05] comprehend him
[17:08] all right
[17:09] and to do that would require that
[17:13] uh
[17:16] you and i have the same mind
[17:21] you know
[17:22] of the author that would be doing the
[17:24] writing
[17:25] for us to understand
[17:27] now
[17:29] in that then we're just not writing a an
[17:31] operational book to be able to operate
[17:33] on a body
[17:35] you know
[17:36] you go down the doctor and say well i'll
[17:38] give you a book
[17:40] and then you can just go do it
[17:42] we'll just go order your book but you're
[17:44] not going to do no open heart
[17:47] operational me
[17:51] right
[17:52] yet you've got the book
[17:56] brother brown said i don't want any
[17:58] little young doctors operating i want
[18:00] somebody with experience
[18:02] all right
[18:03] why
[18:05] because
[18:07] the book tells you exactly what to do
[18:11] right
[18:15] that's why they say that it takes
[18:17] 12 years to be a
[18:19] a
[18:21] veterinarian
[18:22] and only takes about eight to be a
[18:25] medical doctor
[18:26] because they say well all the animals
[18:28] are different
[18:30] you know
[18:32] well i thought all humans are different
[18:34] i thought that's why they couldn't give
[18:36] everybody the same thing
[18:38] but that's just their terminology okay
[18:40] now get to the point then
[18:44] that we're looking at god unveiling
[18:47] himself
[18:51] bringing himself out into the open
[18:54] that he can be comprehended
[18:57] and then everything in the creation
[19:04] will reveal him
[19:06] if we just
[19:09] think about it i remember years ago i
[19:10] used to preach on the the creation there
[19:13] in genesis
[19:14] and taken each day you know and what was
[19:16] created etc etc
[19:18] and bringing it down
[19:20] and bringing it to a great comprehension
[19:23] you know i thought to worthy if we could
[19:26] see god unveiled by his own word
[19:29] right out of his own creation the way he
[19:31] made things
[19:33] i believe the way that
[19:36] man is made
[19:39] even in the physical we'll get more into
[19:41] the spiritual first but
[19:44] even in the physical
[19:46] what keeps all of them little things
[19:48] running in the body got a couple of
[19:50] nurses sitting here
[19:52] what makes all them things work
[19:55] you know
[19:58] can you explain it
[20:02] can you explain how that you can
[20:04] cut a place
[20:07] and you cut the nerves into
[20:11] right
[20:12] and you know that god has designed a way
[20:16] some way that that nerve ending can
[20:19] connect back over a period of time
[20:23] and the feelings will come back
[20:26] now what causes that
[20:29] oh it just happened to flip-flop around
[20:31] you know
[20:35] something else is in charge
[20:38] the human body was made with a
[20:41] an immune system
[20:46] that it took a lot of breaking down
[20:47] before
[20:49] it began to deteriorate a lot
[20:52] because it was a strong immune system
[20:54] and still even is
[20:56] you know
[20:57] you don't know what in the world you eat
[20:59] drinks
[21:00] you breathe you know whatever
[21:03] that would kill you
[21:05] if it wasn't for the immune system
[21:08] and the way it works
[21:10] all right
[21:11] we see god now is unveiling himself
[21:17] but he's going now what i want you to
[21:19] think with me
[21:20] we're going to go through him unveiling
[21:22] himself
[21:26] but i hope you haven't forgotten
[21:29] the series we've been in
[21:33] i hope you haven't forgotten
[21:36] the point of what i'm trying to bring
[21:39] that
[21:43] we believe in predestination
[21:46] before knowledge
[21:48] all right
[21:50] but we've been through it to go back
[21:51] into the back part of god's mind and
[21:53] we'll start out reading
[21:54] from christ some mystery
[21:58] and we went back into that mind in the
[22:01] understanding that
[22:04] you and i
[22:06] by the new birth
[22:10] are the children of god
[22:16] amen
[22:17] we are not
[22:18] what he created
[22:22] we had to be that physically and we'll
[22:24] get to those things
[22:27] but this beginning of the creation of
[22:29] god to this age
[22:34] is unveiling god that never had a
[22:35] beginning
[22:38] if you have eternal life today right the
[22:40] prophet says you always was eternal
[22:44] what
[22:45] the eternal life you have
[22:47] but there was a time you didn't have
[22:49] that eternal life
[22:51] no but brother dale i got a quote work
[22:53] where i was born with an eternal soul
[22:57] well
[23:01] then you you better give thought to it
[23:03] i've got a quote where it says for us to
[23:05] be baptized father son and holy ghost
[23:14] i got a lot of quotes where the bible
[23:16] speaks of
[23:20] a father a son and a holy ghost
[23:27] but yet we sat no we don't believe in a
[23:29] trinity
[23:34] well what i'm trying to get us to open
[23:37] our eyes to
[23:41] that eternal life that we have
[23:45] is a part of god's own life
[23:49] right
[23:51] and it never had a beginning
[23:55] and we'll never have an ending
[24:00] right
[24:01] that's why your prophet would come along
[24:03] we didn't have any problems saying
[24:07] you wasn't born don't know a certain day
[24:10] you always was eternal
[24:14] but then turn around
[24:16] and teach the whole message that you
[24:19] must be born again
[24:25] but we're taking it like acts 2 38 and
[24:27] matthew 28 19 you know
[24:30] and we're making contradictions out of
[24:32] things
[24:34] if you came with eternal life then jesus
[24:37] christ never had to die
[24:39] oh but brother dale he died to just
[24:41] bring me to the thought
[24:43] he didn't have to die to bring you to
[24:45] the thought all they had to do just talk
[24:46] to you
[24:49] right
[24:52] it'd have been just as easy to come down
[24:54] and just talk to nicodemus went back up
[24:56] to heaven
[25:00] and he did talk to nicodemus didn't he
[25:04] you know what nicodemus couldn't
[25:05] comprehend him
[25:09] you know why
[25:10] because he didn't have the inside
[25:12] teacher
[25:15] see i'm one that believes in a new birth
[25:18] amen and one that believes that you must
[25:21] receive eternal life to have eternal
[25:23] life yes but the prophet of god said
[25:25] well done i just got two you go back to
[25:28] the series
[25:29] and you get all of those where the
[25:31] prophet of god said
[25:33] if you have eternal life
[25:36] then eternal life always was eternal
[25:41] see we want our ideas and our thoughts
[25:43] to to pull to something to connect into
[25:45] this whole human elements
[25:48] and why would we want to connect to
[25:50] these human elements
[25:51] are we like who was it that
[25:54] was it magellan they were seeking the
[25:56] fountain of youth which wants to leon
[25:58] monster leon sailed all over the world
[26:00] come highway across the united states
[26:01] trying to find a fountain of youth
[26:08] is that what we're trying to find cause
[26:09] we gotta admit we're getting older you
[26:11] can comb your hair any other way you
[26:12] want to
[26:15] it's still getting gray
[26:18] you color it
[26:20] but the roots are still getting gray all
[26:24] right
[26:25] you're dying
[26:27] all right but we're trying to find this
[26:28] appeal
[26:30] to some way you know
[26:34] magic formula
[26:36] all right but now
[26:37] remember
[26:41] this was a point we were trying to get
[26:43] across
[26:45] god's first creation
[26:49] without using the creation like a
[26:51] beginning
[26:55] we're using it as the terminology of
[26:58] something coming forth into
[27:01] you know to be made known or understood
[27:04] so god's first creation
[27:06] would be his example creation
[27:11] you agree
[27:14] that's why they argued chicken or the
[27:15] egg forget it
[27:19] he didn't put eggs in the garden and let
[27:21] them hatch
[27:23] well he could have
[27:25] but he didn't
[27:28] solve all the problems
[27:31] he didn't talk about chickens eggs he
[27:33] talking about animals he made
[27:38] if it all been on the egg part of it
[27:40] then
[27:41] um
[27:44] because a lot of animals didn't come
[27:45] from eggs
[27:48] you know what i mean hatched out eggs
[27:52] all right
[27:53] i do that to just be natural
[27:56] because you'd be surprised how the
[27:58] carnality of man's mind will sit and
[28:00] turn off everything you say
[28:02] it's because there's some silly stupid
[28:05] idea that they've conceived in their
[28:07] mind
[28:09] right
[28:10] well you was wrong
[28:12] well like i said the other day
[28:14] if you can tell me i'm wrong you've got
[28:16] to know what's right
[28:20] come on
[28:21] you can tell me i'm wrong to be able to
[28:23] tell me i'm wrong you've got to be able
[28:25] to tell what's right right if i told you
[28:28] my big toe was god
[28:31] well i don't agree with that
[28:34] well now you tell me what's right
[28:38] i guess your big toe
[28:41] but listen church
[28:44] god's plan of redemption
[28:50] i thought that's what we were studying
[28:54] i thought we believed in redemption
[28:57] i thought we believed that redeem goes
[28:59] back to where you come from
[29:04] well
[29:08] then the eternal life that we now have
[29:11] within us
[29:14] by the new birth
[29:16] puts our soul back
[29:21] to where it was in the beginning
[29:26] well you agree with that
[29:31] if you don't come show me something else
[29:33] i'd like to know
[29:38] but think about it now
[29:42] god's first creation
[29:46] would be his example
[29:52] that everything from then on would have
[29:54] to line up to that example
[29:57] and he can't tell you one way to start
[29:59] and then change
[30:01] on the way right
[30:03] so the way he does it first he's got to
[30:06] keep on doing it or else he's changing
[30:09] his mind
[30:11] he's deciding he was wrong somewhere
[30:14] and picking up a better idea
[30:17] well i don't believe in that kind of a
[30:18] god
[30:21] i believe in a god that his first
[30:25] creation would be what he wanted
[30:29] now i say it again
[30:32] first creation doesn't mean a beginning
[30:38] the word beginning doesn't mean a
[30:40] beginning point like we talk about it
[30:44] i've tried to prove that the automobile
[30:46] was here it's in the dirt we put it
[30:48] together
[30:55] the prophet said that the first time he
[30:57] said television was in genesis i thought
[30:59] man
[31:04] you mean adam and eve was turning
[31:05] channels you remember when we used to
[31:07] have two and 11
[31:09] and then they wound up with four
[31:11] you remember
[31:12] when you started with them you know
[31:16] you remember the antenna you had to go
[31:18] outside and turn it to get
[31:20] two and if you wanted to go to live and
[31:22] you had to go turn the antenna
[31:24] kind of oh but we got it
[31:28] but that was here in genesis
[31:31] right
[31:35] see what he's dealing with his abilities
[31:40] when jesus turned around and said
[31:41] television to no man
[31:44] that what television i've heard
[31:45] preachers you know
[31:46] i heard the first television now the
[31:48] first one was in genesis
[31:52] but a vision is
[31:55] a form of a a tv is a form of a vision
[31:59] all right get off that
[32:03] but get to the point now
[32:06] so his first
[32:08] way of doing any things
[32:10] would have to always be the right way of
[32:12] doing it
[32:16] and the way he would come into
[32:18] understanding
[32:21] you know
[32:22] unveiling himself
[32:24] to you and i
[32:27] would be the way that he would
[32:30] unveil
[32:31] you and i
[32:37] don't know what you think on that
[32:41] because you see i i believe in
[32:44] eternal life
[32:47] i've preached about 20 something sermons
[32:49] now on for knowledge to predestination
[32:54] going back into the mind of god and
[32:56] being part of the mind of god that does
[32:58] the thinking
[33:01] amen
[33:08] you see
[33:11] if he had a
[33:13] if he knew that if he remembered last
[33:15] sunday if he made us he knew he was
[33:17] going to fall
[33:24] well now
[33:25] it wasn't eternal life that he was
[33:27] talking about
[33:32] are you with me
[33:37] it wasn't eternal life he was talking
[33:39] about
[33:41] it was you and i
[33:44] as people
[33:47] did he knew it we
[33:49] he made us we'd fall
[33:56] because we're going to get down probably
[33:57] won't this evening but i mean today
[33:59] we'll get to it wednesday or whenever
[34:04] adam and eve had eternal life
[34:08] that's what your prophet said
[34:09] blasphemous names go read it
[34:15] all right
[34:21] then his
[34:22] way of bringing it would have to be
[34:25] line up perfectly
[34:32] how did he come into being
[34:34] well what do you mean he always was
[34:37] okay
[34:39] how did he come into our understanding
[34:41] or come into the ability for you and i
[34:44] to comprehend
[34:48] we could not comprehend him you got to
[34:50] admit it's hard to even comprehend him
[34:52] after all of what he's done for us
[34:57] after all he's done all these years and
[34:59] give us eternal life it's still hard to
[35:01] comprehend
[35:05] an eternal god
[35:08] and that's what people keep asking me
[35:10] questions about it and i know it's
[35:12] questionable i have them too
[35:14] was god real before the world
[35:17] you know
[35:18] what kind of body did he have
[35:20] where did he live
[35:24] you know
[35:25] was it some world or something
[35:35] you see church we go haywire crazy
[35:37] trying to figure it out
[35:42] he said was god real
[35:45] if he wasn't real where did we come from
[35:49] something brought us
[35:52] you want to talk about us being real
[36:00] but you see
[36:02] he never had a beginning
[36:05] like humanity has a
[36:07] beginning that's right
[36:13] to redeem means to go back where you
[36:15] come from
[36:22] so then
[36:23] if we believe we always was eternal
[36:27] then how can you be redeemed
[36:30] what are you going to redeem eternity
[36:31] with
[36:35] but you know you can go back to eternal
[36:38] life if you believe it correctly
[36:40] if you receive it by the new birth
[36:44] all right
[36:46] so when he was saying
[36:48] that he knew if he created us we'd fall
[36:53] he was not talking about eternal life
[36:58] he was talking about us as peoples
[37:06] and remember the first two that did fall
[37:09] they had eternal life
[37:17] well how did they fall with eternal life
[37:20] how can you do wrong
[37:25] because that body and spirit is not born
[37:28] again
[37:30] amen well brother dale i don't do no
[37:32] wrong
[37:33] what's in you cannot sin
[37:36] but the bible speaks plainly that we're
[37:38] nothing but sinners
[37:41] sins the scripture calls it
[37:44] christians the prophet said have sins
[37:47] well now brother there what that means
[37:48] is
[37:50] that
[37:51] that means just a plain old nominal
[37:53] christian
[38:00] all right
[38:02] you're the one dividing it not me you're
[38:04] talking about adam and eve
[38:09] but think about it now
[38:12] in god's mind
[38:16] as we covered the morning stars were
[38:19] singing
[38:21] and the sons of god were shouting for
[38:23] joy
[38:25] when the sons of god saw the plan of
[38:28] redemption
[38:29] come into view
[38:31] that's what your prophet said
[38:38] remember
[38:40] and i know there's a quote in the seal
[38:41] book that's what i was just dealing with
[38:43] my brother and said they fell from
[38:44] eternal life
[38:46] now
[38:48] how can you fall from eternal life
[38:51] there's another one of them matthew 28
[38:53] 19 you know
[38:55] acts 2 38 deals how can you fall from
[38:57] eternal life
[39:02] adam and eve fell from living eternally
[39:04] in flesh because they never had
[39:05] achieved that ability
[39:07] all right now
[39:08] any other explanation outside of that
[39:10] what are you going to do with it
[39:15] all right
[39:16] thank god for
[39:18] some simple explanation sometimes it
[39:20] helps us to understand adam and eve
[39:22] never died and went to hell
[39:25] the prophet said they had
[39:27] a redeemer
[39:30] so they fell from ability to come to
[39:32] eternal life
[39:35] in flesh
[39:39] because they had eternal life in their
[39:40] soul
[39:44] but what about the plan of redemption
[39:50] now i tried to explain it to you the
[39:52] other day
[39:54] we wasn't sitting there and eternal life
[39:56] looking down and say yep we're going to
[39:57] go down we're going to be lost
[40:01] that's mormon
[40:04] that's a mormon doctrine that was all up
[40:06] in heaven and decided to come to earth
[40:08] to be lost a word that we could glorify
[40:11] our father
[40:19] but you see we
[40:21] we just take our human terminologies and
[40:24] so
[40:24] well it's got to be this because of that
[40:30] i remember brother hampton's had a point
[40:31] already get tickled at him
[40:33] he said a equals b
[40:36] then there's one thing for sure
[40:39] b's got to be the same thing as a
[40:43] you think about that is true
[40:47] but when you try to apply that to
[40:50] if it says this
[40:53] we've got to go that way
[40:56] well
[40:57] the prophet said it and i believe it
[41:02] yeah
[41:02] i got a quote and i just read it this
[41:04] morning
[41:05] were you talking about the trinity
[41:10] you ever heard him say let's stand and
[41:12] address the third person of the trinity
[41:18] see there he taught one god for all him
[41:21] years but really he was tremendous
[41:26] that one's what i'm gonna hold on to
[41:27] because he's a trinitarian you know why
[41:28] because you're one
[41:32] and that's what you want you want him to
[41:34] be what you are
[41:38] quit trying to get the message to change
[41:39] to fit your life
[41:41] change our lives to fit the message
[41:46] can we be what he is
[41:48] what he's talking about
[41:51] all right
[41:55] but you see the key to understanding the
[41:57] bible
[41:59] is we'll get to
[42:02] is to see
[42:04] how that god
[42:06] made man
[42:12] why because the bible says
[42:16] let us make man in our own image
[42:20] now look at that right the bible says
[42:22] let us that's two
[42:27] i found one one day when the prophet was
[42:29] talking about and i thought
[42:31] well that'd be something to try to get a
[42:32] trinitarian look at
[42:35] he said he was talking to the animals
[42:38] when he said let us
[42:42] remember he already made the animals
[42:44] before he made the human right
[42:47] the human body was made
[42:52] on the sixth day
[42:55] right
[42:57] because there wasn't no creation on the
[42:58] seventh
[42:59] he rested
[43:03] but see then that's where you can't get
[43:04] that together it's why it's confusing
[43:06] because chapter one deals with the sixth
[43:09] day
[43:12] but chapter two of genesis deals with
[43:14] physical creation
[43:18] but you know when that physical creation
[43:19] took place it took place in chapter one
[43:22] under the sixth day
[43:25] i'm not talking about the spiritual
[43:26] creation wade's going to get on that
[43:27] this afternoon i told him i'd hold back
[43:29] as much as i could
[43:34] but i just want you to think
[43:38] the key then to understand
[43:41] man
[43:44] is to see that how god
[43:47] could come and be unveiled
[43:51] you know and reveal himself
[43:53] all right then the key to understand god
[43:56] is to see how he made the man
[44:03] because he made us in his image
[44:07] all right
[44:09] see that's the key to understand
[44:13] is to see how he was made
[44:20] and you better hold on to this now
[44:23] you better hold on tight
[44:26] because his being made had no beginning
[44:29] right
[44:37] okay
[44:38] if i'm wrong i want you to show me
[44:43] so if the man is made in the image of
[44:45] god
[44:48] he had no beginning
[44:57] okay
[45:00] so what i said sometimes it's not good
[45:02] to think i know all about it so we
[45:04] should get onto something else
[45:07] and sometimes the little catch phrases
[45:09] will hang on to us
[45:11] and we begin to see hey wait a minute i
[45:12] don't exactly understand
[45:18] then you'll see that i wasn't playing
[45:19] around wednesday night
[45:22] i just turned my ways of saying it
[45:27] don't ever think
[45:31] then i'm not trying to bring out
[45:32] something when i drop back
[45:35] it gives me an opportunity to simplify
[45:38] things
[45:40] as to
[45:42] help you and i don't understand
[45:44] if i was you i'd go back and listen to
[45:46] wednesday night services
[45:47] i'm just saying that of course i know 90
[45:49] of you ain't going to do it
[45:51] but at least 10 will so that's the only
[45:54] good ones
[45:55] the other 90
[45:57] you just paying the taxes around here
[46:00] it will not be that way brother to hell
[46:02] well if you went to school
[46:05] and the teacher assigns you a subject
[46:07] you're supposed to go home
[46:10] now as smart
[46:13] as sister
[46:15] ruth is
[46:17] she still had to turn in her homework
[46:22] they just didn't look at her and say
[46:24] you're smart we're gonna make you a nerd
[46:28] we know your dad is smart your mama's
[46:30] smart your brother's a doctor
[46:33] you know
[46:35] that's not exactly the way it goes is it
[46:39] that's not exactly the way it is with
[46:40] god
[46:43] if you're going to believe me as your
[46:44] pastor and i'll give you an assignment
[46:46] go back and do the assignment
[46:49] i ain't got time okay
[46:52] forget it
[46:56] then you fit into the category as i said
[46:58] you're making yourself the 90s it's not
[47:01] me i'm not throwing off on nobody
[47:03] you tell me to listen to something you
[47:04] better believe i'll go listen to it
[47:10] well because you told me i need to
[47:12] listen to it
[47:13] so you need to go back and listen to
[47:15] wednesday night and just
[47:16] watch the tone in the way
[47:20] i just preached across the whole scale
[47:25] of something for us to look at
[47:30] because church i haven't forgotten
[47:33] at least i haven't
[47:35] forgotten
[47:38] when we're talking about foreknowledge
[47:40] and predestination
[47:42] the foreknowledge and predestination is
[47:44] dealing with earthly child travel
[47:47] journey
[47:48] life
[47:52] the morning stars sang together and the
[47:53] sons of god shouted for joy
[47:56] if they were the sons and daughters of
[47:58] god
[48:01] that was eternal life
[48:05] that's why i kept emphasizing it hey
[48:08] down here is where we're shouting
[48:12] that's what i said over the fellowship
[48:14] meeting yesterday
[48:16] and he said a word and i said wish i
[48:18] could sing shouting on the hills off
[48:20] globe read
[48:23] why
[48:25] because i'm shouting now about what i
[48:27] see
[48:29] i'm rejoicing over the word that i see
[48:34] about you
[48:39] but get this in your mind then write it
[48:41] down
[48:44] when we talked about going upward and
[48:47] going in and coming into the mind of god
[48:53] i haven't left that yet
[49:02] just because we started a condescending
[49:04] toward earthly forms
[49:07] doesn't mean that i've stopped anything
[49:11] see i do believe
[49:13] i believe the eternal life you have
[49:16] by the new birth that you must receive
[49:18] when you got here
[49:20] and jesus christ had to die to release
[49:21] it but i believe once you receive that
[49:24] eternal life that eternal life is the
[49:26] life of god
[49:30] and that's not another god
[49:35] that's god
[49:36] in another form
[49:40] that's his offspring his
[49:42] children that's who we are
[49:46] but but brother dale i know it
[49:48] i understand
[49:50] it's hard to comprehend
[49:55] that god would
[49:57] condescend down to mankind
[50:01] and take that mankind
[50:04] and make him a part
[50:07] of the god that created him
[50:14] that's hard for us to even sensibly
[50:17] think about
[50:19] he said well brother dale you're making
[50:21] yourself god
[50:23] i'm not making myself god
[50:27] if i'm a child of god what am i
[50:31] god made manifest in another form called
[50:34] a son
[50:36] i'm not a son of a son
[50:43] that's why i believe the way he
[50:44] condescends
[50:47] is to make himself known to you and i
[50:50] and then when he creates the man
[50:52] he's trying to get the man to see
[50:57] who the man really is
[51:02] and what he has made us
[51:05] i just don't forget that he made us i
[51:08] just don't forget that we were lost
[51:11] body spirit and sold and doomed and on
[51:13] the way to hell
[51:15] and jesus christ came down
[51:18] and paid the price
[51:21] he went to hell for me
[51:24] he sent his soul back on the day of
[51:26] pentecost the prophet said in the form
[51:28] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:30] he said and as it's until down through
[51:32] the ages and coming out to where we are
[51:34] and once it's given out
[51:41] i believe in eternal life
[51:47] i believe the eternal life you have
[51:50] is the life of almighty god
[51:56] we're not a second person because he
[51:57] wasn't the second person
[51:59] yes but that's what i don't know see
[52:01] we're second person but he's the first
[52:02] person no he ain't the first person he
[52:05] is the person
[52:06] and then that don't make us the first
[52:08] person not the second or the third
[52:14] that means god now is invade unveiling
[52:17] himself in human flesh amen in you
[52:27] you see why has i fought so hard all
[52:29] these people in their doctrines i'm not
[52:32] against anybody i love everybody
[52:37] i don't
[52:40] i don't have anything against somebody
[52:42] that don't believe the way i
[52:44] believe you know why because it was time
[52:47] i didn't believe the way i believe
[52:55] and i never have believed i was the only
[52:57] one on the beach
[53:01] i fought you that thought i was a
[53:03] prophet and things
[53:05] told you to the pulpit you're you're
[53:07] wrong
[53:09] i'm just a child of god
[53:14] i'm just a minister of the gospel
[53:19] i have no ministry of relating to a
[53:22] prophet
[53:23] well the word the word's supposed to
[53:24] come to you too according to my bible
[53:26] and my prophet the word comes to the
[53:27] spirit field
[53:30] we're all prophets
[53:32] in the bible terminology
[53:34] and even put your sisters in there
[53:39] because we're the ones that the word has
[53:40] come to
[53:42] but listen church
[53:44] the key to understand is to see how god
[53:47] is made made what are you saying
[53:50] how god unveiled how he come into
[53:54] a situation or existence of where we can
[53:56] comprehend him
[53:58] and then by doing that then we can look
[54:00] back at the man he created
[54:03] and see the man he created shows exactly
[54:07] the same way he came
[54:11] that's why we're not trinitarians
[54:14] see we're not oneness
[54:17] well he sure doesn't sound like well no
[54:19] no no
[54:21] because see we're we believe in god
[54:23] unveiling himself
[54:25] god changing his form
[54:29] but it's the same god
[54:30] well that's oneness ain't it
[54:34] no because he would never will
[54:37] lose those attributes
[54:40] even though they are finished and we get
[54:42] into eternity we will still remember him
[54:45] as our savior as our healer as our
[54:48] father
[54:50] as our advocate we will always remember
[54:53] that
[54:54] he never loses an attribute
[54:57] he just makes it into being the word it
[55:00] will come forth even the bible says
[55:01] today will come to sonship paraphrasing
[55:04] the scripture will terminate it doesn't
[55:06] mean terminate like going away with
[55:15] it doesn't mean that
[55:18] it means that it's not existence in the
[55:21] basis of
[55:22] calvary
[55:24] but yet you're still looking at him with
[55:25] a nail prints in his hands what about
[55:27] looking at an eternal god with nail
[55:29] prints in his hands
[55:30] you can't you can't comprehend that
[55:41] it's just
[55:42] it's uncomprehendable you know for our
[55:44] human terminologies
[55:46] oh
[55:58] all right
[56:02] but see
[56:03] if you read genesis just in the creation
[56:07] of the days and what was made etcetera
[56:09] and etc
[56:10] you'll see the plan of redemption coming
[56:12] into view
[56:16] because now like i said when you get
[56:18] into chapter verse when you get into the
[56:21] sixth day you'll find man created
[56:26] right
[56:30] when you start over on the
[56:33] the chapter 2
[56:36] that doesn't mean you've passed
[56:38] this the rest in the 90s god worked six
[56:41] days and rested
[56:47] he's been resting ever since he had to
[56:48] come to earth and do all he done
[56:54] but mankind was created in genesis 2 in
[56:57] a physical form
[57:00] that's over after he created in genesis
[57:02] 1
[57:03] 26 and 27 in a spiritual form
[57:08] if we can find out about that man
[57:11] we could see
[57:12] where we're at
[57:13] and to find out about that man we got to
[57:16] find out what it would mean to say that
[57:18] we are created in his image
[57:23] we got to see what image he's got amen
[57:27] right
[57:31] then we can follow it
[57:33] okay
[57:35] let me read just a little bit let's get
[57:36] started
[57:40] let's go to chrysler mr god reveal
[57:45] and i know we've been over this and over
[57:46] this but
[57:52] i hope you don't have problems with
[57:53] reading what he said
[57:56] christ the mystery god revealed this is
[57:58] paragraph 102
[58:00] through 104.
[58:04] now god's great secret mystery
[58:08] he had before the
[58:10] world began
[58:12] now god back in the back part of god's
[58:15] mind
[58:17] there was something that he was trying
[58:19] and was going to achieve
[58:24] he had a motive in doing it
[58:26] what was his motive
[58:27] in order to let himself be expressed
[58:33] now let's don't get up there too far
[58:34] because see that's where we would go too
[58:36] far on the terminology of thinking we're
[58:38] god
[58:41] this is himself being expressed it's not
[58:43] me and you being expressed you've got to
[58:45] let him be expressed first
[58:48] amen
[58:52] my brother told me one time he said
[58:54] brother dale i see it
[58:56] he said i see us coming into view
[59:00] it's wonderful
[59:02] but i said if he don't come into view
[59:04] first then you're messed up
[59:10] it's not him coming not us coming into
[59:12] you first he's got to come into view
[59:14] first
[59:15] because if you try to come into view
[59:16] first and you are into satan's part of
[59:19] saying i am god
[59:22] remember the devil said that's what he
[59:24] wanted to be right i will ascend to the
[59:26] most high i will be like god
[59:28] then he gets over in writing finally i
[59:30] will be gone
[59:35] aren't you careful that you might fall
[59:36] into that no
[59:38] you know why because i've already seen
[59:41] the plan the plan is him coming first
[59:46] that's right
[59:47] it's not you're not coming first
[59:54] we are part of the plan
[59:57] but it's his plan
[1:00:01] all right
[1:00:04] he had a motive
[1:00:06] in doing it in order to let himself be
[1:00:08] expressed
[1:00:10] because first there wasn't even a moon
[1:00:11] star i had a molecule or anything he was
[1:00:13] god
[1:00:15] but he actually wasn't god at that time
[1:00:17] because god is an object of worship and
[1:00:19] there wasn't nothing to worship him all
[1:00:21] right
[1:00:22] now
[1:00:24] as i said back to the thought a moment
[1:00:25] ago
[1:00:29] do you think
[1:00:31] what do you think about god
[1:00:34] well a god is just a spirit
[1:00:37] he has no form
[1:00:39] he just floats around he's just
[1:00:42] you know
[1:00:43] he didn't need a world to exist in
[1:00:46] because he just floated around
[1:00:51] i wish brother branham had explained a
[1:00:53] few things
[1:00:56] you know paul went to the third heaven
[1:00:59] and brother brown said it he thought he
[1:01:00] went to the first right
[1:01:04] now if you want to get technical he said
[1:01:06] he went to the first heaven you won't
[1:01:07] get technical with what he's saying the
[1:01:09] first heaven is the millennium
[1:01:13] i'm quoting him whether you like it or
[1:01:15] not
[1:01:17] but what i'd like for him to explain one
[1:01:19] time he said there was a seventh heaven
[1:01:27] not lord
[1:01:29] we can only think about one or two
[1:01:36] and this man talking about the seventh
[1:01:37] heaven
[1:01:44] see
[1:01:45] we think that that
[1:01:48] heaven is not real
[1:01:52] and we're going to read
[1:01:54] wednesday night
[1:01:57] we're going to read where the prophet
[1:01:59] says what did he make this world out of
[1:02:02] he said i don't know
[1:02:04] because it wasn't nothing there to make
[1:02:05] it out of it
[1:02:11] right
[1:02:14] but it came from somewhere
[1:02:21] what if we one of these days come to
[1:02:23] find out
[1:02:24] that this world here is just a camping
[1:02:27] ground for us
[1:02:33] that we're able to enter into other
[1:02:35] dimensions right
[1:02:41] when in another dimension television is
[1:02:44] passing right through us right now
[1:02:46] you gonna prove it set one up here and
[1:02:48] turn it on
[1:02:49] does all them people run through them
[1:02:51] little wires
[1:02:52] they small people ain't he
[1:02:54] that's how dumb we are
[1:03:01] and you mean today that i can pick up my
[1:03:02] telephone and i can dial into you
[1:03:07] and instantly somebody will answer the
[1:03:09] phone
[1:03:10] right
[1:03:13] now you explain that
[1:03:19] no our mind is still in the cable that
[1:03:21] run across the ocean you know
[1:03:24] and they finally got connected and they
[1:03:25] said hello london how you
[1:03:28] and we realized when that happened back
[1:03:30] there that we said
[1:03:32] london
[1:03:37] you know what i mean so much time lapse
[1:03:39] was into the wordings and things
[1:03:42] you explained to me how all this works
[1:03:43] and we'll begin to understand what
[1:03:45] heaven's about
[1:03:47] i believe heaven where god would i
[1:03:49] believe there's a heaven where he lived
[1:03:51] i believe he was there and he was real
[1:03:55] was he a man the bible says he was
[1:04:01] the prophet said he's a being he is not
[1:04:04] like the wind blowing here in yonder
[1:04:06] he says he had the headquarters
[1:04:13] you know we might get away from one of
[1:04:15] these days and our dumbness and think
[1:04:17] about we talk about you know we've
[1:04:19] preached for 2000 years about streets of
[1:04:22] gold
[1:04:24] what's any problem with streets of gold
[1:04:31] well it could be some streets right why
[1:04:32] can't it be gold
[1:04:37] do you understand what i'm getting at
[1:04:38] something real
[1:04:43] i'm talking about a real god
[1:04:48] what kind of a world did he have
[1:04:51] my lord what are we even thinking about
[1:04:52] some kind of a world that a god would be
[1:04:54] living in
[1:04:57] when he's god
[1:05:00] and i'll just ask you a simple question
[1:05:01] where did this earth come from
[1:05:04] he said well it was created where was it
[1:05:05] created from
[1:05:08] well he took molecule he took this and
[1:05:10] he put potassium where'd he get the
[1:05:12] potash
[1:05:21] come on
[1:05:23] i know i've been on that for so many
[1:05:25] years till i go crazy about it and i go
[1:05:27] crazy about thinking about an eternal
[1:05:29] real god too i don't think about just
[1:05:31] some imaginary spirit floating around
[1:05:36] brother branham wasn't tearing up the
[1:05:38] scriptures when he was telling you god
[1:05:39] is not a
[1:05:40] not like a wind
[1:05:42] he's a being he's a person
[1:05:46] he knew john 1 5 24 well god is a spirit
[1:05:54] you think he was trying to destroy that
[1:05:55] scripture
[1:06:03] i know it gets on me and i'm sorry
[1:06:06] but what gets on to me is not you people
[1:06:09] i'm telling brother ray about it this
[1:06:10] morning what gets on to me is the
[1:06:12] preachers in this message
[1:06:14] i'm sorry
[1:06:17] they've got the gall to stand in your
[1:06:19] face and say i don't agree with you
[1:06:21] you say well show me
[1:06:23] well i i don't know what it is but i
[1:06:25] don't agree with you
[1:06:27] shut up
[1:06:32] that ain't even common sense that's
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:40] in school they taught us
[1:06:43] one plus one equals two
[1:06:50] and we were smart enough to come up with
[1:06:51] two plus two
[1:06:54] is four
[1:06:57] but you know one plus one is really 11.
[1:07:03] oh you're just being silly that's what
[1:07:05] i'm trying to show up our silliness
[1:07:09] that's right
[1:07:10] if i tell brother collins to brother
[1:07:11] calling i don't agree with you
[1:07:13] i'm supposed to tell him why
[1:07:16] i don't agree with him amen or else shut
[1:07:19] my mouth
[1:07:21] because i can't show him he's wrong
[1:07:24] i just don't agree with him you know
[1:07:26] what i'm saying i don't like your looks
[1:07:27] you hurt you know
[1:07:29] you know something
[1:07:30] when brother colley come in one day
[1:07:32] he's been hanging around those swat
[1:07:34] folks
[1:07:35] he'll start laughing because he knows it
[1:07:38] he came in one day
[1:07:40] and he walked in the office where i sit
[1:07:43] i looked at him i said let it grow out
[1:07:46] that's the first word to say
[1:07:48] you know what because he shaved off his
[1:07:51] every which he called at you much thai
[1:07:52] asia i never didn't know the difference
[1:07:54] in bearded mustache he shaved it off he
[1:07:56] didn't look like brother collie
[1:07:58] i said let it that's the first word i
[1:08:00] said i said let it grow out
[1:08:04] don't try to be like us
[1:08:06] if you want to look like us that's fine
[1:08:07] you don't look like us forget it look
[1:08:09] what you're supposed to be
[1:08:10] black man without a beer or mustache you
[1:08:12] know what you're calling he's funny look
[1:08:13] at feller
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:16] my brother daughter he's like our granny
[1:08:20] because that's common
[1:08:23] all right just be what you are
[1:08:25] let's be christians yes
[1:08:28] but god is a being
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:33] he's not he's a person
[1:08:36] everyone said he's the person of eternal
[1:08:38] life
[1:08:40] yes but we just can't comprehend that
[1:08:45] well that don't mean we can't talk about
[1:08:46] it that's right
[1:08:50] how many of you to eat lunch
[1:08:56] well do you know how that that works
[1:09:00] you know
[1:09:02] do you know how it works and all that
[1:09:04] food gets in there and goes to this and
[1:09:06] goes to that
[1:09:10] and for some way
[1:09:11] it stops in certain places and it goes
[1:09:14] through the walls of the intestines and
[1:09:17] etc out into the body to make blood
[1:09:20] cells and can you explain that
[1:09:23] no
[1:09:24] but you ain't gonna quit eating
[1:09:26] and you ain't gonna quit talking about
[1:09:28] it well i ain't gonna quit talking about
[1:09:31] god
[1:09:32] but i believe he's real
[1:09:39] because he brought he created me
[1:09:43] i believe i'm real don't you believe
[1:09:44] you're right
[1:09:46] but look what he says now
[1:09:48] i want to get this thought and then
[1:09:49] we'll i'll just quit on this right here
[1:09:52] brothers love these because they don't
[1:09:53] have to rewrite new notes in the office
[1:09:56] they just pull them up again and just
[1:09:58] keep pulling them up
[1:10:00] but look what he says
[1:10:06] he was
[1:10:08] not the father we know that
[1:10:11] not god excuse me not god because god is
[1:10:14] an object to worship
[1:10:15] well there's nothing to worship him
[1:10:20] now
[1:10:23] he created angels we read
[1:10:28] and they worshipped him
[1:10:34] now angels are not
[1:10:37] people
[1:10:40] they're ministering spirits
[1:10:43] but yet they have a form they are people
[1:10:45] and i mean look like they can have a
[1:10:47] body in a form of what we call it but
[1:10:49] they're not body spirit and soul as
[1:10:51] human beings right
[1:10:55] because when he first created them they
[1:10:57] could only worship him
[1:11:02] but when they failed it didn't make him
[1:11:04] a father i mean a healer
[1:11:07] or a savior
[1:11:09] it was not their fault
[1:11:11] brought out his attributes
[1:11:14] were you listening
[1:11:16] well
[1:11:19] so in his great mind he wanted these
[1:11:20] attributes
[1:11:22] to be expressed
[1:11:25] what's his attributes father son holy
[1:11:27] ghost
[1:11:29] healer savior redeemer et cetera
[1:11:32] all right
[1:11:34] and in him was love and him it was to be
[1:11:36] father and him was to be son and him was
[1:11:38] to be a savior and him was to be a
[1:11:39] healer this is before anything was ever
[1:11:42] created
[1:11:43] already there and all these great
[1:11:45] attributes that we see already expressed
[1:11:47] they were in god
[1:11:55] so my opinion the first thing
[1:11:57] that he made was angels
[1:12:02] all right
[1:12:05] and they worship him and that made him
[1:12:07] god
[1:12:08] and he started from there
[1:12:11] okay
[1:12:13] as in previous message he tried to
[1:12:14] explain to bring that angels began to
[1:12:16] worship him that was before there was
[1:12:17] even a molecule in the earth
[1:12:20] there was nothing it was all darkness
[1:12:22] there wasn't no sun no moon
[1:12:24] no no moon there's no stars no nothing
[1:12:26] then he was god
[1:12:28] and as he asked job where were you when
[1:12:30] i laid the foundation of the world see
[1:12:33] when the morning stars sang together the
[1:12:34] sons of god shouted for joy
[1:12:36] now
[1:12:37] where were you see
[1:12:39] that was way back before the earth
[1:12:44] so now i'm going to say something
[1:12:46] so listen carefully
[1:12:51] your morning stars i was brought it up
[1:12:53] to a place that's what i try to do i get
[1:12:55] up what i think we can understand i have
[1:12:57] to back off and wait a little bit the
[1:12:59] sermon on to come back up again
[1:13:02] when we were talking about the morning
[1:13:03] stars singing together the sons of god
[1:13:05] shouted for joy
[1:13:07] the sons of god
[1:13:12] were before
[1:13:15] the angels were created
[1:13:23] i just dropped the bombshell
[1:13:29] the first thing he created was angels
[1:13:32] people are not things
[1:13:36] so it's not a creation like we call it a
[1:13:38] creation
[1:13:43] the sons and daughters of god we're part
[1:13:45] of god
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:59] the sons and daughters of god have
[1:14:00] returned to life
[1:14:02] i haven't lost that yet
[1:14:06] they are eternal
[1:14:14] so he created the angels
[1:14:18] as his first things that he created
[1:14:21] but his sons and daughters never had a
[1:14:23] beginning
[1:14:30] if they did were you going to put it in
[1:14:31] eternal that's right
[1:14:33] all these doctrines is running around we
[1:14:35] always was eternal why don't you get
[1:14:37] back into talking like dad about
[1:14:38] something
[1:14:44] i believe eternal life never had a
[1:14:46] beginning
[1:14:51] but i believe in god that we wasn't
[1:14:52] little people running up and down in his
[1:14:54] body you know scattered all around all
[1:14:56] of us doings
[1:15:05] you profits when he put that in the scr
[1:15:07] in the quotes i didn't
[1:15:09] talk about the sons and daughters of god
[1:15:12] but look now god had a purpose and a
[1:15:14] hidden mystery
[1:15:16] and that's what i want to speak on to
[1:15:17] the church this morning
[1:15:20] the hidden mystery of god that he had in
[1:15:21] his mind before the world ever begun
[1:15:27] when he existed alone
[1:15:29] that's not up here that's me
[1:15:31] and now this unfolded itself right down
[1:15:33] to this present hour that we're living
[1:15:35] see
[1:15:36] then you'll understand clearly then you
[1:15:38] see
[1:15:39] i believe on what is being done
[1:15:42] now i'm going to ask brother anderson if
[1:15:44] he can do something for me
[1:15:47] can you pull up paragraph 106 while i'm
[1:15:50] talking
[1:15:52] i deliberately left it out but
[1:15:56] i want you to see what he's talking
[1:15:58] about
[1:16:01] a great mystery that god had in his mind
[1:16:03] before the world it's a secret
[1:16:13] to express himself
[1:16:19] so then he knew he was going to
[1:16:23] bring into being
[1:16:26] a group of people
[1:16:29] that would be his offspring
[1:16:34] but he knew if he put us in human flesh
[1:16:37] with the free moral agents he attacked
[1:16:39] upon it
[1:16:40] that
[1:16:42] we would fall
[1:16:44] but he knew that within sight of him
[1:16:47] could not fall
[1:16:51] what was this great mystery that he had
[1:16:58] then you'll understand clearly then you
[1:17:00] see on i believe
[1:17:02] what is being done i'll run this up
[1:17:05] run on up a little bit higher brother
[1:17:07] before we
[1:17:08] god's great mystery of how it's a secret
[1:17:11] he kept it a secret
[1:17:13] nobody knows nothing about it even the
[1:17:15] angels didn't understand it see he
[1:17:18] didn't reveal it
[1:17:21] that's the reason under our
[1:17:24] seventh mystery
[1:17:28] when the seventh seal was opened
[1:17:31] there was silence
[1:17:35] there's a reason it's psalmist nobody
[1:17:36] didn't know anything about it
[1:17:41] this great sister mystery secret that
[1:17:43] we're talking about
[1:17:46] is just what he said it was
[1:17:50] the seventh seal
[1:17:54] the thing that everybody says can't be
[1:17:56] understood
[1:18:05] it can't be understood by the world i
[1:18:07] agree
[1:18:10] but the bride of jesus christ
[1:18:16] can see it amen
[1:18:18] amen
[1:18:20] why because god used the prophet to tell
[1:18:22] us
[1:18:26] to unfold it
[1:18:28] to unveil it
[1:18:30] to speak of what mankind would not
[1:18:32] darson to even try to speak of
[1:18:37] what god had in his mind
[1:18:46] to reveal the plan of redemption
[1:18:49] the plan of redemption wasn't completely
[1:18:53] unfolded or made known
[1:18:55] even in the great apostles and
[1:18:58] even on the day of pentecost
[1:19:03] it was not made known until this end
[1:19:04] time
[1:19:07] when the prophet came to reveal the
[1:19:09] secrets
[1:19:11] remember he has no certain mystery
[1:19:14] remember that
[1:19:16] he used to take all of the loose ends
[1:19:18] and time together
[1:19:21] but he's to reveal those seven thunders
[1:19:24] which are the revelations contained in
[1:19:26] the seventh seal
[1:19:27] and it'll be these divinely reveal
[1:19:29] mystery truths that literally turn us
[1:19:31] back
[1:19:32] so i'll say this for wade's benefit this
[1:19:35] afternoon so if we can see how that man
[1:19:37] in
[1:19:38] genesis 1 26 come into being we can see
[1:19:41] how god can come into being we can see
[1:19:42] how god come into being we see how that
[1:19:44] man comes
[1:19:53] you mean god can use two people to speak
[1:19:55] on one thought yeah
[1:19:58] no problem
[1:20:01] if the same two people have the holy
[1:20:02] spirit there's no problem anyway come on
[1:20:05] musicians
[1:20:10] and see if i was you i would go back and
[1:20:11] listen to wednesday night because you
[1:20:13] seen it wednesday night my point was one
[1:20:15] time
[1:20:19] get away from creation get away from
[1:20:21] beginning get away from thinking of your
[1:20:23] terminologies
[1:20:25] and get down to where that when god has
[1:20:27] something
[1:20:29] over here veiled
[1:20:32] and then all at once he opens that veil
[1:20:37] what was there was there all the time
[1:20:44] brother brown said god never sent a son
[1:20:46] to die
[1:20:47] he came himself
[1:20:51] that's why i asked that time i said when
[1:20:53] did son of god appear and everybody was
[1:20:55] saying
[1:20:56] 2 000 years ago i said the son of god
[1:20:58] was in the beginning before the eternal
[1:21:02] and yet you call him a son
[1:21:06] because remember
[1:21:07] nebuchadnezzar saw something
[1:21:12] and if he saw it he knew it was god
[1:21:14] because he's taking care of the mother
[1:21:16] three
[1:21:16] and if he could see it he couldn't call
[1:21:18] it nothing else but a son
[1:21:20] another form
[1:21:22] you see i believe in god unveiling
[1:21:24] himself
[1:21:25] that's why i'm not a oneness because one
[1:21:27] is stopped as jesus the lies form of god
[1:21:31] i don't believe that i believe the bride
[1:21:34] of jesus christ
[1:21:36] is the last form of god to the gentile
[1:21:38] dispensation
[1:21:42] so we're not oneness
[1:21:45] neither are we trinity
[1:21:48] let's stand together what we got
[1:21:50] 668 inspirable 668 anybody have a
[1:21:54] need what a
[1:21:56] wonderful change in my life has been
[1:22:00] wrong
[1:22:01] since jesus came into my heart
[1:22:07] i have a light in
[1:22:22] do i like some people experience things
[1:22:26] i've heard some of you talk about
[1:22:31] being in the presence of god
[1:22:39] and knowing how real he is
[1:22:44] see maybe everybody doesn't come to that
[1:22:45] point but if you'll just think about the
[1:22:48] new bird
[1:22:53] you just think about the new birth of
[1:22:55] god living in you
[1:23:00] eternal life
[1:23:04] living in you
[1:23:18] it just makes you like somebody said i
[1:23:20] don't remember where brother branham but
[1:23:21] said you just think about him
[1:23:25] he said he's so real to you until you
[1:23:27] wish you could just reach in there and
[1:23:28] get him and bring him out
[1:23:31] and just hug him and hold him
[1:23:42] salvation is not a conversion of thought
[1:23:48] well i was going this way and i turned
[1:23:49] around what made you turn around
[1:23:55] alcoholics anonymous will turn you
[1:23:57] around
[1:24:01] but they can't bring christ into your
[1:24:03] heart
[1:24:07] they can't bring that person that i'm
[1:24:09] talking about get into you
[1:24:13] till you know it's real
[1:24:22] one day somebody
[1:24:25] is going to believe it
[1:24:27] and we're going to walk off this earth
[1:24:36] because they're going to see how real he
[1:24:38] is
[1:24:56] since jesus came into
[1:25:00] it was all kind of life and last night
[1:25:02] at the fellowship meeting because i was
[1:25:04] trying to lead that song and brother
[1:25:06] richard got up behind the scene he said
[1:25:07] you heard that thing so many different
[1:25:08] ways
[1:25:09] you know something like that because
[1:25:11] everybody's got their own words you know
[1:25:13] to go to anything but it's what you're
[1:25:15] thinking about
[1:25:18] it's what you're thinking about
[1:25:21] if we were back there shouting before
[1:25:22] the world begun
[1:25:24] you say well that was just god's mind
[1:25:28] all right
[1:25:29] you say well that was when okay i'm glad
[1:25:31] you thought of that away because that's
[1:25:32] when we're out here today
[1:25:35] right
[1:25:37] we're right here today
[1:25:39] shouting about
[1:25:40] the salvation that's been revealed
[1:25:44] so as we're dismissing let's sing that
[1:25:46] to one another okay
[1:25:48] if we don't get it the same way that
[1:25:49] it's supposed to be
[1:25:51] we'll sing it the way we want to sing it
[1:25:54] nobody has to worry about it right
[1:25:56] shouting on the hills of glory
[1:26:01] shouting on your dismiss
[1:26:03] shouting on the hilltop shouting on
[1:26:13] just keep singing that way over and over
[1:26:16] we're
[1:26:16] shouting on the hip dog
[1:26:26] father just be with everybody and we
[1:26:28] just miss this afternoon
[1:26:40] oh
