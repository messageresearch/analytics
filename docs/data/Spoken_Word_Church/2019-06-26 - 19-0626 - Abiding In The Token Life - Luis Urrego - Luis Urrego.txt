amen [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you ready for the word let's just sing you open the eyes of my heart and brother Louise comes to bring the word of the Lord and true it's okay any other announcements that we've missed first Saturday will be not just coming today it would have to be our Bible study and the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday of July so remember these in the announcement okay let's just sing open your eyes my heart is brother Louise comes to bring the message of open eyes Oh Bernie eyes [Music] I want to see open me eyes of mine if that's your desire that's what God will do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah praise the Lord how many appreciate the Lord Amen oh I hope you were happy to be in the house of God this afternoon I certainly have so much to thankful thank him for we are privileged people in this our Saints to know the things that we know but not just to know them amen to be able to apply them to our lives to have that ability to apply them amen and certainly it's a honor and a privilege and I'm so thankful to the Lord for it amen so if you want to turn with me to Exodus chapter 12 Exodus chapter 12 I want to speak this evening on the little topic called abiding in the token life amen so the token is something that's probably very familiar to all of us but we just want to speak about it maybe dissect it a little bit more taking this scripture and let's see how the Lord leads a man you pray for us a man you pray for me because certainly you have we have notes and you prepare yourself but ultimately is what God wants to speak right Amen that's what we want to we want to yield ourselves to give you for the Lord to give to you through us what you need amen praise the Lord so that's what we desire amen so let's just read this Exodus chapter 12 verse 1 it says and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb foreign house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your your account for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening notice I said the whole Assembly and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eating out of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof amen and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover thanks I believe in verse 11 amens just as just as revelations 10 verse 11 amen that's what we should be doing in this hour and man we should be eating this lamb mmm ready to go because it's supposed to a man we're this thing's about to finish up amen and so I believe that that's what we need to be doing as the Bride of Christ so let's just let's just bow our heads tonight our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for once again allowing us the privilege Lord Jesus to speak father God to your people Lord God father God you helped me Lord Jesus to only say father god those things that would edify you Lord and or would glorify you and edify the people or God Lord I I commit myself into your hands now and Lord just bless father God those that have needs amongst us we thank you Lord God for what you're doing and brother Colley Lord and we approve Heavenly Father for your healing hand Lord for father God has certainly been on our hearts these last few days Lord Jesus we commit the service into your hands father god we honor you we glorify you and we put our sins under the blood of Jesus Christ right now father God and thank you father and ask you these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen may God bless you says you may be seated amen abiding in the token life Saints you know we see in in the scriptures that this is not just the only scripture that that is representative of what of what this is talking about Amen we see in other places that we don't have time to get into maybe there'd be another part to a part three or whatever we'll see how the Lord leads but this right here gives us and let us know how important it is amen - not only abide by the instructions of that God has given us amen and this our God has given us instructions they men God has given us a message for this day amen and it's not a message that he gave us a man for us to just have it on a shelf Amen or for us to just read it and-and-and-and and be like the men they're in James that he looks up on the mirror Amen and sees himself but doesn't do anything about it hey man it's like you looking at the mirror in the morning you wake up with your nasty breath and your hair all over the place and you know you got to brush your teeth you gotta brush your hair you're gonna do all these things but you just kind of look and then you just keep going and I believe that's how many of us are taking the Word of God in this house amen we're just sort of look and we're happy because we just glanced but in hand we got to see we got it look a man in order for us to be able to do something about it amen because if you don't do anything about it God is not going to force you amen God is a God is a God of he's a gentleman as brother branham said he doesn't force any of us to serve Him he wants you to do it out of your own heart he wants you to fix yourself in the mirror out of your own heart amen he's given you the tools he's given you the the way to do it amen but ultimately it's you that has to do with amen and God did not give us a message in this our Eman sent the prophet in this day for us to just sit around amen and not do anything about what that message says I believe that brother Branham was sitting here a man he would be he would he would be I would let you ask this question would he'd be upset would he be what's the word I'm looking for would he be this this disillusioned of what's going on around in this hour or would he be happy you think about it Saints so so this message census was sent to us amen for us to apply amen because we're Saints this is a as as brother Wade was talking about Sunday this is a word that needs to be lived amen it's a living word in this hour that needs to be that needs to be displayed to the people they meant that needs to be displayed to out to the outside amen a living word amen an eternal sign amen praise God you know when when when Noah was given that that sign amen that was an eternal sign that rainbow Amen I had to do with his covenant amen it was eternal and if you've got the Holy Ghost in this Howry menu you should be displaying that eternal sign amen because that is the token and this hour which we will get into here in just a moment amen so so here in Exodus chapter 12 verse 3 it says speak ye unto and if the brothers could just bring it up and we're just kind of gonna go verse by verse I just I love doing this because just kind of take our time amen we just I don't think we have any rush going anywhere but we'll try not to keep you long tonight amen in Exodus burst Exodus 12 verse 3 says speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day very interesting that it says in the tenth day put that put that and apply that rebel in Chapter ten of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for in house amen praise the Lord so you see how it says that a lamb for an house each house had to have their own land each house had to have their own sacrifice that they were going to sacrifice it wasn't enough for for the further for the priests to have the lamb it wasn't enough for Moses to have a lamb it wasn't enough for the next-door neighbor to have the lamb they each one had to have their own lamb praise God and same thing in this our Saints each one of us has to have own lamp it ready amen in our lives amen you have to have your your own experience with Christ it's not enough that Brazil has this experience that's that has nothing to do with you it's not another brother Boyd has an experience or brother weight or anybody here has their own experience young people you have to have your own experience amen it's not enough that your mom and dad a man brought you here to church amen or that they have their own experience you have to have your own experience with Christ you have to have your own lamb amen ready praise the Lord and each household had to have the lamb ready amen in their house so the question is is do we have the lamb in our house ready is the token going to be displayed in the house is the token going to be displayed praise the Lord so says and if oh yeah first yeah verse three according to the house their father is a lamb for in house amen so there must be there there was gonna be a lot of lambs a lot of lands because there was a lot of people amen and if they were listening to that message they were gonna put it into action but if they really care about what was going on that he really cared that he take seriously like most people in this day don't don't take it seriously what was given to us in this hour amen then they were not gonna apply that in their life now verse 4 it says and if the household be too little for the lamb in other words if the house doesn't have enough members let's say it's just a husband and a wife and you know if you say if you take a lamb now lamb is is is the is the is the baby form of the of the animal you see and then there's the sheep there who is the adult right so the lamb even even a small little lamb is still part is too much for just two people right even three people right to eat so the the Bible's here here says if the household be too little for the lamb in other words there's not enough people to eat that lamp because remember they had to eat the whole thing mimin they had to eat the whole day and God made a provision for them for that because I mean not everybody had 15 kids maybe there was there was some that couldn't even have kids right maybe there was want some that just had one kid some had two right so if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it take what take that lamb right according to the number of the souls they meant in other words you're gonna you have to get with your neighbor or whoever you think will be able to share that lamb with with you or you share that lamb with them according to the and and and and be able to divide that lamb according to the number of the souls amen every man according to his eating shall make your account for the lamb so when they were young when the neighbor when you and your neighbor would come together you would portion out that lamb according to what you'd think you can eat right and that's exactly a man what God was telling them to do a man and I believe Saints that God has given us a lot a great great revelation in this hour we're blessed we're blessed here as a church to rehab what we have amen and then we I thank God for the amen but amen I believe that Saints the world out there needs to also receive and and hear what we get in here as well they meant that's the reason why I fully don't agree with just as us for no more amen III I think that we need to go out and share amen what God has given us oh it's it's all it's great it's wonderful that we have what we have amen and I love that what God is given through brother Dale any man but it's not enough that brother Dale has it amen you got to have it for yourself amen praise God and you know sometimes things we take this attitude that if somebody's wrong or somebody said something wrong or somebody believed something in a certain way maybe that's just a phase that they're going through that doesn't mean that they're like that Amen have we sat down and talked with the brother have we sat down and talked with the sister amen but sometimes we get this critical spirit on us that we here have the truth we're the ones who got it all and nobody else has that's not the right attitude attire that's not the right attitude to take because you're not gonna win anybody through to Christ if you with that attitude you're not gonna win anybody to Christ with that attitude you're not gonna help anybody we're supposed to be a light and how are we gonna be able to share the light out when we would just want to keep it here to ourselves yeah amen that's not the attitude say you see God was telling them amen if you have too much of the lamb for your household be willing to share it's exactly what he was saying everyman brotherly kindness that's exactly right brotherly kindness I just sometimes it bothers me that sometimes we get these critical spirits on us I'm just gonna bring it down home saying you you you just eat the lamb alright you don't laugh cuz III go for me too I have to eat this lamb to this lamb was had to be eaten with bitter herbs as well so we go through hard times but with it's also by just going through those hard times I mean we can experience the sweetness of the lamb as well they meant praise God amen now verse five says your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the Sheep or from the goats Amen now this lamb a man had to be without blemish amen in other words you could not have a lamb you could not have a lamb that was lame or blind or had or had some sort of blemish on it amen it had to be a perfect lamb that was the only land that God was going to receive if they were to really but if they really believed the message of that hour that was the type of land that they had to take a men now I want us to to read a scripture and if the brothers could turn to it in in Malachi chapter 1 verses 6 through 8 amen because Saints Israel in Leviticus they were given the ordinances of how these you know officially how this lamb should have been should be taken but then it came to a point Saints that Israel would offer these lambs and it just became such a ritual for them such a routine for them that they came to a point where they just offered up anything to the and they didn't even care now I want you to read what it says here in Malachi chapter 1 it says verse Texas has a son this is God speaking through Malachi a son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then I'd be a father where's mine honor right in other words God saying a son if you have a son or daughter they honor their father in other words in Israel there was sons and daughters who honored their parents right a servant his master they had servants amen they would honor the the Masters we get would get honored by their servants right but then God is asking if then I be a father where is mine honor yeah when I ask you that question if he's Father if he's if he's your father where is the honor that you should give him are you giving him honor through your life or is it wishy-washy yeah well I've got a church I do what I'm supposed to do amen III I'm here yeah but are you giving him honor through your life because remember Saints it's a life lived that God is looking for the life of Christ he doesn't care that you that you just show up but what's your reason for showing up amen young people what's the reason for you showing up amen what's the reason for you to listen to your parents what's the reason for you to he that that that that has been instructed to you for all these years do you just do it so you don't get in trouble I'm speaking to everybody or do you do it because in your heart I want to honor the father I have my father here on earth but my true father amen I want to honor him amen because in honoring your true father your heavenly father you're not gonna have any problems honoring your earthly father or your earthly mother amen you're not gonna have any issues obeying when they tell you to stop doing this or don't do that or do this and to go this way amen you're not going to have any issues at all if it's if it's in the word if you and if it's godly counsel you won't have any issues whatsoever why because you're in love with your father man hallelujah amen and if I'd be a master which God is our master right where is my fear in other words where is that fear that you should have for me if I'm your master if you say that I'm your master this is God speaking if you say I'm your master where is the fear that you should fear me amen in other words uh-uh not not to be scared of God but but but but to be uh that's a godly it's a godly fear Amen no reverence Amen of it it's exactly right and if I be a master where's my fear set the Lord of Hosts unto you o priests that despise my name now he's talking to people who He gave His Word to - to do these these sacrifices and to do these things and they came to a point where they despised the name of the Lord ah why because they've led it they let it to be so common so routine in their life that they came to a point man just enough it's another it's another communion service I know there I go they're gonna pass around the plate and in the you know we get her and we drink the wine and then everybody comes up washes their feet and not thinking about it what the what that all that means not thinking one minute what all them is not work cuz you've taken it as a routine that's what I'm talking about Saints right what are we doing here Oh priests that despise my name and ye say wherein have we this but and so the priests are asking where have we despised your name and you know that Lord knows more than you do no load knows better when you think you're getting away with things and you think that you got it all figured out God's got something else there that you would have no idea you offer verse seven you offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say we're in have we polluted thee in other words they're asking that question where and what have we polluted the Lord in that ye say the table of the Lord is contemptible now that we're contemptible means that there's no know that it can be it can be despised it can be hated yeah you know it is really not not taking it for what it really means the table you say and that ye say that's this is the point that they got to they started saying the things of the Lord eggs you know just go to church or not because that's how it's gotten to not nowadays it's okay to miss a service here but it's not okay that's your own that's your your own idea that's your own plan it's not in God's plan it's not even it's not in God's plans that it's not it's not in his word in that ye say the table of the Lord is contemptible and if you offer the blind for sacrifice now watch this is what he's talking about these lambs remember he told them in there an exorcist after Toby shall offer a lamb without blemish now they come to a point if you offer the blind for sacrifice blind lambs or blind animals for sacrifice is it not evil right and if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor in other words now he's saying you give the governor that in other words if let's say President Trump came through here right now I bet you some of you the one you guys are sleeping right now you would not be doing that right now but yet we're in the presence of God and that's what we do it that's exactly what Malachi was saying is it not evil and if you offer the lame mistake is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person you offer what you do every day in your life the way you act in church the way you live your life down a daily basis oh the church people may not know what you do at home but you do and God knows what you do at home or don't do at home we do what if and if and if president Trump would walk in here or whoever you think is the greatest person on earth walks in here I bet you that the attitude that you come to church most of us come to church with that's not the attitude that you would have young people the attitude that you come to church with are you that you're about to bite your whole finger off if you but can you explain what's being taught the Saints this is life coming to the house of God it should be life it should be something that you love that you want I can't wait to go to the house of God and get free from the from my job amen where there's cursing amen there's there's all kinds of hypocrisy and all kinds of stuff and that's the only rest place that I have throughout the week it's the word amen will he be pleased with D or accept thy person set the Lord of Hosts what an analogy that God gave there so they got to a point where they were where they were told them and I've had believes in Leviticus somewhere in Leviticus where God give tells him again to not offer lambs or animals with blemishes so he put it in he put it into into into the law and these priests came still under the law they didn't care anymore oh we've come 40 50 years now since the message has come and we've we've we've got some of us have gone so far away from what from what the way you acted when you first believed you're so loose now I'm so loose now we don't take God seriously anymore until we're left behind and until we until until we're death dead spiritually completely then you realize my goodness what have I done don't let that don't you don't come to that point young people take life seriously now right hey man take this word seriously what is it that my mom and dad have tried to tell me for 16 years 18 years it's time for you to experience God for yourself amen it's okay that you have like I preached last times okay for you to have goals it's okay for you to have visions that's good and you need to do those things ain't man but place the Lord always before you put God first and everything before anything else because let me tell you every single thing that you do in this life whether it's marriage or whether it's it's all those things those things are good but you whatever you think the rosy things that you're thinking it's only temporal eventually it comes down to a relationship between you and God I can go into some some some more details but I don't want to do that amen the things because I was once young brother Dale was young for the Wade was young but the boy was really young [Laughter] we've all had all evens our sisters have all gone through those thoughts gone through those motions and great when God gives us a partner in life and lets us love somebody amen but ultimately it has it's between you and God ultimately you'll come down to it when you've experienced what marriage is and the benefits of marriage and all those things you know wonderful wonderful but then it comes down to I still have to serve the Lord boil it down I still got to serve God and you and your partner has to have his own relationship with God too or her own relationship with God amen praise the Lord how did I get into that amen where's God now you look at Cain Saints Cain came to a point well he probably he probably heard maybe what was needed to be offered he probably he probably knew but it wasn't revealed to him amen it wasn't it wasn't a revelation when something becomes a revelation they meant you go and do it amen and so that's the reason why he came in here Oh God God will take fruit just as much as he took my brothers offering my brother is offering a lamb a sloppy look at look at look at that altar it's all dirty and nasty and bloody but look how clean mine is and I'm sure God will take it you'll be surprised you'd be surprised what you think God will take in your life right and then you wonder why you're not growing in Christ what why I'm not I'm not going I don't understand whenever I go to church I don't understand what beam's what's being preached I don't understand what's being talked I don't understand what are you letting in your life that's taking your thoughts away from Christ what's in your home that's keeping you from continuing and moving on with Christ because your own you don't think those things matter but they have spirits spirits to try to keep you a man from people and keep walking with with Christ it all matters amen it does matter you know now Exodus 12:6 says no I'm sorry yes Exodus 12:6 and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month in other words keep that Lamb unto the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening amen amen so this message this message that God gave to Moses to give to the people was to be lived out and acted upon here in the in the evening time amen and it was in the evening time that God gave us the message that God gave us right now it's time to put it into action we've we've got we've got word after word we've got the letter of it from from i from 1947 or 48 yeah 2 to 9 1965 some of us can quote exactly the the paragraph number and everything but you still don't know what you still not displaying the token in your life you're still not applying what the message was brought to us to do it because let me ask you Saints mask what's more important that God sent us a prophet and gave us a message or taking that having a people take that message and living it out what's more important a lot of us still live in 1960s 1950s with the relics of what God did back then I know I don't care about relics that relics don't save me that's not the token I'm looking at a man I'm looking for a life amen relics don't save me I don't care how much we're brother Branham was or I don't it doesn't matter to me I visited Jeffersonville I visited these places but that never did anything for my salvation I've seen in almost all the pictures there brother that they took a brother branham never gave me the Holy Ghost I've listened to almost all the messages not one time amen it has to be Amen that God reveals that word to you so that you can put it into action brother Branham said clearly that the message is Christ now like what what what where the Wade said just after brother the team Hume said a man we're not giving people Christ anymore we're not preaching Christ anymore amen we're just we're just preaching them quotes and and and and and and but not give not not turning the people to Christ and Christ is still there waiting until you get off your high horse I know I got this quote here and then and then the this one counteracts what counters that with this quote and things like that but they don't know it's all about those things he saw those things back in the early days where we're past that now and none of that saved anybody right none of that saved any by Saints III say we we need to get in step with this word because Saints there's young people here that need the Holy Spirit there's there's little kids I have two girls that need the Holy Ghost for you to be fighting about some quotes and and and and and me and telling me to look at relics it's gotten so bad Saints now I'm just gonna it's gotten so bad that now they've got little kids and I'm not gonna say the entity but all of you would know it if I knew they got little kids making crafts with a door right a little house with a door and right out there on the front it says the token tape boy or something like that and they got a tape the token of the tape right above the door that's what to them that's what that's become the token has become a physical relic nothing about the life and that's not what they're teaching their kid the children and I feel terrible for these children the all these children that are being taught these things and not being taught what the Prophet really said about the token just showing them relics I'm gonna preach against it until I until I die because I can't stand seeing parents your parents need to be careful because let me tell you what he comes in with flatteries he comes in with flatteries and you're not going to be the seeds bye-bye a Catholic Church or by a by a Baptist or a Pentecostal or anybody like you going to be the seed by somebody who comes with tapes who comes with that with the pictures who comes with everything and it comes with the Prophet that's what you'll be deceived by and you know what he's doing he's targeting your children he's taught he knows that if he can get that next generation he's not there they are not receiving the message and you and it's up to you parents to be be careful and be aware nothing wrong with listen to the tapes you've got to listen in to the tapes have those tapes even playing every single day in your house some some brothers they play it 24/7 that's awesome brings an atmosphere good atmosphere but if you're not giving those kids a man their truth behind those tapes and you're just showing them the tape the tape the tape the tape you're not you're doing them a displeasure at this this disservice he comes in with flatteries now I did it it doesn't matter who's who he's the son of it doesn't matter to me has nothing to do with me in Christ amen but you have to answer for that if he's if you drift away from this word amen you'll be the one to answer because amen brother Bradley brother Brennan would be rolling in his grave right now with those types of things well you may not like it but that's not what brother Branham says in the message and I'll prove it to you here in just a moment amen now what was greater amen so this entire body of Christ is to be this of the same mind they man for the same cause amen I believe that we need to have the same goal the same mind the same the same cause a man and it's Christ amen praise the Lord just as Jesus he had to completely die out to himself so what must we doubt to ourselves today a man saying that Lamb a man that they that they had to eat a man it was tender a man it was it was young and the reason why he said to get again you get it young because usually the the young the young animals excuse me a calf or a lamb or something like that those are the ones that taste better right better than an adult cow or an adult goat you know usually the younger ones are the ones that taste better and it's and and and why did God say get a one that's younger than a year or not even more not more than a year because it has not had time to pollute itself with the things of the world you see he Christ a man he he showed forth all those qualities he didn't have time to pull it himself with the world with Hollywood or with with all these things amen he was all about the father's business and that's the lamb that we need to we need to prepare we need to eat amen praise the Lord amen their Exodus 12 7 brothers could bring that up and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door posts of the houses wherein they shall eat it amen so they were to take there were to take this blood amen if and brothers if you could bring up that picture the with the doorpost you know this this is a little visual saints a man they were to take that blood of the of the Lamb that they held for they took on the tenth day of the month held it for four days a man killed it and took some of that blood why because the Death Angel was coming death was striking the land death is gone about to strike this land or death is already stroke struck spiritually a man but the whole thing is about to go go up amen and death was about to strike and this is the message that they needed to do they needed to put the blood on the on the lentil up at the top and on the sides amen praise the Lord so it says here and on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat it in other words there's needed to take that blood and and strike it and strike it on the doorpost of their own house on the doorposts of our next-door neighbor's house that that's not enough that's the reason why as the word is going forth you need to see say Lord that's for me Lord I know you're talking to me but this is what we like to do I wonder if they're listening oh I hope they are this is for them and not knowing that you could be just like those priests offering just whatever in your life and you're thinking about somebody else yeah you're thinking about somebody else's life how they are walking spiritually not you you don't look at your own self what's wrong with your life are you fully serving the Lord do you fully have the token they on display hey man the blood needed to be applied on the doorpost right on the top and the button on the sides the brothers could bring that picture back up just keep it up until I say but why did not the Lord say to put the blood down into at the bottom of the of the threshold or at the bottom where the floor the entrance of the of that of the house why just on the sides well for one saints you know that this is representative of the cross of the death of Jesus Christ right that lamb all this Hall represents Jesus right but two Saints you have to look also remember remember what the scripture says I believe it's in Hebrews it says unless unless you trample the blood of Christ amen that we don't take this thing so seriously and what we do is and when we don't take the the things of God so seriously it's like you just trampling over the blood so God didn't want the blood to be trampled upon amen that's the reason why he wanted it around around the sides amen not on the threshold now I'm not down on the floor amen not for you to trample on it and for you to to to to because remember saints adore is for you to go in and the doors for you to go out right and you could have that blood in your life you could you could come to church you could do you go through the motions you could have justification sanctification and not have the baptism of the holy ghost amen and be able to just go out we've seen it people have a come in anybody Hey oh thank god I've got the blood amen and then all of a sudden you seem to go out and in and for you to be able to go out you have to go under that blood you have to trample the blood of Christ you have to go through the Christ who is the door amen for you to walk out completely God's already given to prevent provisions for you amen the blood the door everything amen he is all those things amen but for you amen to completely be wordly and leave this gospel and leave this message and leave all these things you have to go and face all those things leave all of that amen praise God Hebrews 10:29 says how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall be thought worthy who had trodden underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace amen so you you decide if you're gonna stay in or stay on stay out but it's guaranteed a man that you'll died with the rest of the world when you're out spiritually spiritually speaking and that day it was physical death and this day is spiritual death and that's worse that's worse than physical death amen praise God so young people it's up to you it's up to you decided am I in or out you some of you are getting to an age that now you've got to make major decisions in life am I in or am I out right am i going with the with the with the world the things of the world the fashions of the world the the thing or am I gonna stay with Christ and man under that blood covered under that tokin amen that's where I want to be Saints in this hour and men covered under the blood completely I can't save myself and neither can you amen but well I know somebody that's already done it for me I plead the blood amen we may fall we may fall many times flat on our face Saints but if you stay hidden under that blood there's cleansing for those amen amen because Saints God is all about Redemption Saint you see he's all about Redemption he wants to save you he wants he wants to forgive you he wants to give you the Holy Ghost he wants to do all they give you all these benefits but the question is do you want it right do you want - amen now now brother Branham he brought this out this blood as as a token and of course the scripture talks about it as a token and a token means the definition of the word token means a things serving as a visible or tangible representation of a fact quality feeling etc my brother Branham says it like this and in the message token now what now what is first a token it's a word that's commonly used among we english-speaking people especially here in America a token is a really the dictionary says that a token is a sign it's a sign of a fair price paid see that the Pharaoh or a price a required price that's been paid amen praise the Lord so for example Saints uh you know what let's let's just say you know this is this is a gift right and I give it to brother Dale right well that is a token of my appreciation to brother Dale right you see we say that phrase a token of our appreciation to brother Dale but here's the thing Saints when I gave brother Dale this token every time he sees that token it's supposed to remind him of me of who gave it to him not-not-not it doesn't remind him of himself doesn't remind him of a brother wait because brother way had nothing to do with that right they're supposed to remind him of me right right and Saints if the God has given us the Holy Spirit in our life amen it shouldn't point us to anything else they should point us to the to a man it should not point us to any other movement he should not point us to a relic it should point us to the life of Christ itself amen the Holy Spirit that's the token amen so the token a man like for example the blood a man wasn't necessarily the blood was the token amen but really that blood represented that there was a life that took the place of them you came you came with that blood you came with that lamp and you slaughtered it in your mind thinking this this animal this innocent animal is taking my place amen and here I'm using this blood and every time I look at this blood it tells me that this animal amen took my place the blood itself didn't have any life it was the life that was in the blood Saints that's what I'm saying saying is that there is no life in relics there's no life in none of these things external things amen the chemical part of the message if you were to say that way there's only life in Christ and Christ is only in his word amen praise the Lord hallelujah Christ is in his word Christ is not in it Christ is not in in anything else outside of the word praise God now I want to make it a little simple so by the way don't maybe come here and help me you probably already heard that but brother John come here you can you come stand right here hey man then you already standing up come here come here Thomas come here man and and come here come here uh let's see come here uh Esther step right up and let's see we need one more I need one more let's see hmm hmm all right let's see come here uh we'll get a ghetto all right Kayla yeah you got this you got this smile on your face you see some of these as I'm going around looking for kids some of these kids are just looking forward I hope you don't call me I hope you don't call me I hope you don't come yeah all right so just just to show what this token is amen I'm gonna you're about to ride on a train right I go to Toronto with my wife came in from Toronto when you ride the subway over there and you pay your fare they give you a token a little little token and it's it's for you to give to the to the people that is letting you into the subway to the train so that you can get through now so so you've come here and you purchased you purchase the you made the purchase and so you're uh you're gonna get your token right and you're gonna you're gonna get your token all right you ready to ride the train all right all right you're gonna get your token no maybe depends how good you do here and you're gonna get your token all right now the the one that for you to get on the train you have to go through brother wait so Kaley you go ahead and give your token oh you're gonna let her it through right your ferret if the affair has been paid oh no I said her fare has not been paid come here John her brother wait was in our name now now you see see all of them had this is the token that they gave i all three of three of them here had had this one had these the greens right that we use here in America one of them had this this is so pretty it's Canadian money it's pretty it's it's nice yeah it doesn't look fake but it's it's but it's not the token it's not what is gonna go through brother wait to let them in on the train right it's a piece of paper it's it's actually looked better than these but it wasn't enough for her to get through the total through the train right so you'll get to ride you get to ride you get to ride and I guess you'll get to ride too so thank you very much you may be seated you can keep that Esther as a relic because you can't use it here in the America just just let it always remind you of the token yeah all right but I wanted to do that visual for the little kids to let them know you've got to have the token on display the correct token right the true token amen not not no substitutes no and it could look almost just like the real thing and not be the real thing right praise the Lord amen so the blood showed that God's requirement for the taking of the life of the Lamb for the believer was met that's what that blood represented amen amen and so that token represented it identified the believer amen the one that sacrificed they meant that Lamb and the blood came out it identified him with that lamb right praise the Lord Jesus because saints let me tell you it was okay for those Israelites to have the lamb right they had the lamb but it wouldn't matter nothing if they would not kill the lamb right they could have had the lamb but if they didn't kill it Martin and they would not be able to put that blood over the doorpost amen and so that's how that's how sometimes we are we nitpick or what we want to do I like this but I don't like this I'll do this and this I won't do a menu got to have you got to do it follow all of the message there's a whole message or it's nothing amen praise the Lord Jesus amen amen look what brother Brown says here as the brothers could bring up to the world it's a bunch of foolishness in 1963 the token I just want you to read with me I'm nodding I didn't give these to the Brethren and the orders that that we usually give but I'll just I'll just read and if they pull it up then amen all right to the world it's a bunch of foolishness but to God it's the only way the only thing that he requires is that token it must be there and you cannot have the token until the fare is paid then you are a possessor of the token which gives you the privilege of a free pass I'll see the blood I'll pass over you amen what a time that that what a privilege to know that you pack within you the pass notice that he says within you when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's the only thing that he'll recognize it's nothing else that can take its place no substitute no denomination no nothing else it takes that God said that alone will I see so no none of your ideas none of nobody's ideas nothing nothing else it's only Christ amen the Holy Spirit in your life is the only thing that's God's gonna see because that's the only thing that's that's God himself he only sees his own word right and that the Word of God is abiding in you about the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen which is life but that's that's the whole that's that's eternal life amen if it's about a new God sees that that he knows that you have the token on display and let me tell you what says when the Holy Ghost is abouting in you and your display and that token not just displaying internally but displaying on the outside as well it will display on the outside for everyone to see nobody will nobody will will wonder if you're a Christian or not when the token is on display for real nobody will question is she a Christian see one of the ones who whose family killed the laman and put the blood over the lentils and and they're inside eating the lamb listening to the message every day going to church every time the church doors open it I think she is yeah not just because of the way you display yourself yeah but it's the life the way you live amen because many people can add like Christian sings any many women sisters can grow their hair long many brothers can stop wearing ungodly clothes and sagging their pants and wearing all kinds of chains and all kinds of stuff all over their body tattoos and you know what you don't know and you'll need to do all those things none of those things but that doesn't mean the life of Christ is event you know that's that's only a substitute you're substituting the true token for that and we feel comfortable we sometimes we feel so comfortable hi I'm obeying my parents I do everything that I'm supposed to do and I you know I listen to my mom and dad I I don't talk back I pay attention at church I do all these things and yet really in your heart something is you really desire the world and the token the token of is not really within you amen because remember the token has to be inside hey man praise God let's read the next quote brother Browns and for that yes now for the animal life could not come back upon the human being now I want you to pay attention to this when the blood was shed the life went out of course because it was a unit and when the life's blood was gone from it the life being different from the blood now the blood is the chemistry of the life but the life is something different from the blood right because Saints the when they killed that lamb that blood amen that blood was a representation of what of them having faith on the message that Moses gave to them right but there was a deeper meaning behind that as well right so you could go through the motions of the message you could go through you could do everything you're supposed to do and still not have the life right right but the life is in the blood and the animal life could not come back upon the worshipper when he said this blood of the Lamb he had to apply the chemistry because that the life was gone and could not come back all right ned's you scroll up because it could not come upon a human being because the animal life doesn't have a soul the animal doesn't know that he is naked and he just he doesn't realize sin it knows none so therefore it's a living being but not a living soul therefore that that animal life could not come back upon a human life because it didn't have a soul in that life now there is a life a blood a life and a soul in the life the soul is the nature of the life in other words Saints when the Israelites were killing that that's the reason why they could not receive the new birth in the Old Testament because they could not do that they could they could not receive the Holy Ghost there because the perfect Lamb of God had not come which was Christ so that's why that's why in shedding animals Bloods and only covered sins for them then take away sin it only made it to where God you know God it covers it amen but it didn't take away their sin amen but when Christ came on the scene he died resurrected can't come back on the day Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost amen that's a different story then amen and if you if you still have sin that's because that's up to you between you and God but you as a Christian you don't have to have sin in your life amen if you believe that your sins are gone amen then your sins are gone but if you still live under condemnation if you're always condemning yourself and believing the lies of Satan telling you that your your bad your your your dirty your look what you did yesterday look what you do amen then what Christ did for you if you believe that you know what Christ did for you well not it has no effect on you right because it's upon what you believe amen do you believe that what Christ did for you you know brother Darrell he's been bringing out the salvation amen we appreciate what that series the series that he's bringing out amen it goes back to good old salvation science amen to believe that God amen has forgiven me on my sin amen praise the Lord Jesus that has to be revealed to you as a Baptist when I was in the Baptist Church amen you come to a point where you say yeah I remember when I came to the altar at 12 years old and I sincerely cried and asked the Lord to forgive me for my sin I understood what the preacher was preaching about and I was I was I was sincere but you know what Saints as sincere as I was I still went out into the world and did the things of the world so you can cry that's the reason young people I say I say when you come when you go to the youth camps and all these things ain't men it's wonderful but you make sure that you get the life of Christ amen you make sure that that because I believe that we all it we should be able to go which-which it's awesome to be able to go to the to the youth camps and to do all these things amen I think how do you have all these opportunities when I was younger right praise the Lord but Saints you have to keep in mind him and it's a continual walk with Christ just because you had one experience and at the youth camp or you cried or you shout or you show or something like that which is wonderful if you did but are you growing in Christ is this word still is that token still on display or when you come back from the youth camp you're holy for about three months and then all of a sudden the holiness goes out the door then what happened to what what happened at the youth camp I'm not nothing against the youth camps I believe in them now believe that we need to take our young Peter to I believe that we need to have our young people in anything that has to do with the word I totally agree with that amen anything that involves the word have them in an atmosphere like that because otherwise you know they're just going to be feeding off over there or these other things and they'll be just grow up sort of nonchalant type tight tight yeah children I don't want my children grow like that amen I want to keep in an atmosphere where the word is going forth amen praise God mm-hmm but this glorious place let's see where we had therefore it had no certain nature it was an animal therefore the blood stood for a token that the life had been given but in this glorious place under this covenant there is a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is a tape doesn't say that doesn't the whole the token for the believer today is a relic doesn't say that the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a relic not a blood a chemistry but it is the Holy Spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today amen that's the token God must see this token God must see this token he must see it in every one of us amen I love that because you know I could have said that but it's better when the Prophet says so that so that there's no question that's the message of the day that's the message that's what brother Brandon was trying to tell us you want to display your token get it inside amen next next quote amen praise the Lord I'm almost done here saying yes a blood identified identified the believer because the life had gone out could not come back so he had to have a chemistry he had to have he had to have like a paint of a blood a chemistry that showed that life went from it now the very spirit itself is the token the Holy Spirit itself is a token not the blood see Jesus shed his blood on Calvary right and though in the denominations they did you know and a lot of people they you know that they're all about the blood and thank God for the blood but brother Brennan said himself that you could have a pint of the physical blood of Jesus Christ and you could smear that all over you you could pour it on you and still die and go to hell you see what I'm saying same young people you you could you could do everything physical that you're supposed to do you could you could just you could do everything that you need to do to get by and still die and go to hell amen the blood was shed at Calvary that is true but the blood as far as it is went back into the elements from which it come you see that blood evaporated that blood where's the blood of Christ I want the life that was in the blood that life is the Holy Ghost right that's that that's what can go into me and make me live that life that Christ lived when he was here on earth praise the Lord but the blood as far as it is went back into the elements from which it come from the food that he lived on that Jesus lived on but you see inside that blood cell was a life that started the blood cell to moving if it was the chemistry had no life in itself and therefore it could not move but when the life come into the chemistry of the blood it formed the cell it formed its own cell then cell after cell then it become a man amen and that man was God he Manuel in flesh but when that life returned back the chemistry went to it but the token is the tape no but the token is the Holy Ghost upon the church that they see Christ what are we showing the world are we showing them Christ or we shown them relics I'm not worried about relics you know what Saints there's a brother one time several years ago for a brother brother brother Joe knows him and I think he's met him and he might have come here and spoken before brother from the Amazon jungle his name is brother Isaiah Boris and brother from Venezuela Hispanic brother lives in the jungle and he came to visit in the United States around 2002 2003 and that's when I met him and he was he was amazed that the people here in the message and how they he went and visited Jeffersonville and all that that's wonderful right but he he himself came back and this is what he said a man that lives it out in the jungle here's what he said he said brother Lewis he said I'm going back home now but you know what what's what's important you make sure that you just don't live by relics in your life yeah now that's a man that lived not in America a man that lives in the middle of the jungle who's a pastor has a church down there speaking to people you know supposedly don't have any civilization he himself saying don't live by relics it was wonderful it was wonderful to go and visit the tabernacle he said oh it was great to shake brother Joseph's hand and all that stuff but he said yeah that's not really what I desired though right it's what he said yeah now so you know what this this brother has got it you know he understands it Amen people you'd be surprised and I've gone out and I've been in the mission field you'd be surprised how these people that they're getting the message and they know that it's not just in books and tapes they don't even have all of the messages that you and I have it hasn't been translated and yet they're getting the essence of the message they're preaching it young man about my age young man preaching this to their congregations I know brother right now Nicaragua in Nicaragua right now preaching this revelation exactly the message that brother Brandon brought to us amen the life of the message to the people and he'll he surprises me and it's exactly the message now you see Saints we here in America we got all of the messages we've gotten all of the relics we've got we've got everything and some of these people are outdoing us now it's not about competition that's not what's all about but they've gotten what the essence of this word is about amen are we getting the essence of the word amen praise the Lord I'm just challenging you Saints I'm challenging you that is this it's a late hour amen I know most of us we understand these things but but I'm just you know I I want the young people to understand these things as well Laurie amen they are kids amen they're our future yeah if you don't have kids you know you you you don't understand I have children there's parents here they have children grandchildren and we desire for our children to live to have not the relics or the chemistry of the love of this but the life that's the only thing that's gonna continue living on right and that's gonna influence the world amen praise God amen the net and that next quote the water blood and spirit come when a mother gives birth to the - - to the baby the first thing breaks a normal birth is a water the second thing is a blood and the next thing is life there come from the body of our Lord Jesus Christ water blood in life in the whole church the bride together has been made up through justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the token the whole process amen and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the Holy Spirit I don't see anywhere where he says it's a relic or a tape as they're teaching are these children that it that's what it is that the blood has been shed and that the Holy Ghost is upon the church without us then they cannot raise without the token right the ones waiting for us cannot raise but they're depending on us for God promised he would have it and somebody is going to be there I don't know who it's going to be but somebody's going to receive it the only one thing I'm responsible is to preach it and if he wasn't this the only one to preach it amen that word if it's a live word it needs to continue moving and living amen being continually preached right through a thoughtful ministry and through your lives amen are you sisters lives as well it's God's business to look out for that predestinated seed there is going to be there though because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water aged the blood edge and now the token age of the Holy Ghost I just keep seeing where the token is the Holy Ghost I don't see where it's anything else so I don't know where they're getting this that the token is something else scroll keep going I think I might be the it that might be it okay all right so Saints and we'll just we'll just cut it right there but let's let's read that last last few verses there in Exodus chapter 12 I Exodus chapter 12 verse 8 and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread in other words get leaven out of your house what is leaven worldliness movies you're not supposed to watch accounts you're not supposed to have subscriptions that you shouldn't you need to stop do you know I said just say like this brother Brandon would call it different things in his day nowadays it's different stuff thanks it's subscriptions I can name all different types of accounts yeah unleavened that's leaven in your home in other words that's extra fluff that doesn't need to be there it's taking your time away from God nothing wrong with you no I don't I don't go hunting I don't go fishing I don't do these things I'll do it if you know but it's not what I what I've desired to but some of you love that I entertain myself with other things but I cannot let those things take the place of God and if those things are taking the place of God and me being in the house of God going to church abiding in Christ and and and and in corrupting my home and there's a problem you have leaven in your house and with bitter herbs they shall eat it Amen in other words they this relax their God wanted them to remember the bitterness that they had went through there in Egypt and those bitter herbs it reminded them of the bitterness of the slavery that they had gone through Amen but at the same time you can go through a rough time and life Saints you can go through hardships all of us are not exempt from having bad things happen to us well you say all bad things don't happen to Christians no right my brother brother brother uh boy easy he's gone through a bad thing here and then in the past few weeks brother Colley you know I saw him some of us you know we've gone through some terrible things in our lives lost loved ones and things like that but Saints when you're eating the word amen when you're eating the lamb amen when you're in this word it makes helps to make things better it's an it so thankful it's so peaceful that God's made a way for us say Amen now you don't have to carry all those burdens on you amen but place him on Him who is our burden carrier a man and not an eating out of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence tear off in other words eat everything in other words don't be picky I never supposed to eat the brain they were supposed to eat the heart they were supposed to eat every single thing every part of the lamb every part of that animal they were supposed to eat don't nitpick on this don't just take what you think it's good for you don't just oh no it's everything or nothing amen and with the pertinence thereof that's the intro is the insides and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire last verse verse 11 and dust shall ye eat it with your loins Girt amen in other words ready ready to go man that's how we need to be eating this word as if the coming of the Lord is happening Amen as if we're gonna see the resurrected Saints a man at any moment amen that's how we need to be living our lives your shoes on your feet they were supposed to eat it inside their home with their shoes on right on their feet which represented I'm ready to go and your staff in your hand in other words your walking stick right you're traveling stick spiritually speaking and ye shall eat it in haste amen in other words you shall eat it quickly it eat it quickly or else it'll pass away from you amen if you you because amen as the word is going forth amen receive everything quickly amen otherwise it'll go away from you amen because the word is continually moving right the word is continuing moving it is the Lord's pass over now that's what the word pass over means is that if you applied that token in your life if those Israelites applied that token over the blue over the door then the death angel was going to pass over them right right that's what the passover means and if god sees that token displaying in your life and you you fall flat on your face you commit you commit something but you know that you're supposed to go to god and you go to God and you say Lord forgive me Here I am I can't save myself I can't forgive my own sin but here I am take me and he'll pass over you he'll pass over your sin nope because why that tokens on display you're dependent on that on that not on your own merits you're dependent on him hey Mary praise the Lord Jesus so young people Saints adults kids amen it's time let's take God seriously in our lives let's quit the playing around and and and and and the nonchalant of T of this word your you're becoming adults now and some of us as adults and we still don't know what this word is about we've been coming to this church for 40 years and you still have no clue what the message is right come on people it's time to get with it I need to get with it amen and and and that's that's what we need to do so abiding in the token life amen not just not just displaying the token but abiding in that token and let that token abide in you if you abide in me and I abide in you that's what you will Jesus said amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet praise God let's brother brother boy let's sing I sing when I see the Blood I will pass over you you know what

know death was coming to all of them Egyptians and Israelites so if if an Israelite may have heard the message and they didn't do what the message truly said they were gonna die to their firstborn was gonna die so so this this this this thing about not doing the complete Word of God not obeying the true Word of God is it goes for everybody hey man it's not just for the sinner outside or for the denominator s'en no it goes for the one who's heard the message over there day amen who's heard what they're supposed to do but if you don't go do it you're gonna there's gonna be death in the household in this household this is where the blood supposed to be placed in this household in your household if the blood father's mother's if the blood is applied in your household purse in your physical and your in your spiritual life then you can you can help bring that token into your home as well and then but if you don't display the token in your personal life then how are you gonna expect for your children to display the token or are you gonna expect for your wife to display the token when you're not displaying the token when you when you as a wife is not displaying your token my husband's not displaying the token but you're not doing any night my children are not displaying to talk about what are you displaying right as I said before what your children only go wherever you go right whatever way attitude you take that's how your children will go and then don't submit don't be surprised when they grow up and they don't serve the Lord right you took this thing very
