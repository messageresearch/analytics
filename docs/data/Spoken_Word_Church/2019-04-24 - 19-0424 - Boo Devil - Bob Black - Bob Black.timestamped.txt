[2:47] blessing upon this service tonight in
[2:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:55] Revelation chapter 9 verse 12 so let's
[2:59] start right here 1 woe is past and we
[3:01] know a woe is a world warming so one
[3:04] world war war is past let's just kind of
[3:07] read it like maybe a newspaper here and
[3:09] behold there come two more woes
[3:12] two woes more Hereafter in other words
[3:15] there's coming two more world wars after
[3:18] and the sixth angel sounded and I heard
[3:21] a voice from the four horns of the
[3:23] golden altar which is before God saying
[3:25] to the sixth angel earth had that runt
[3:26] which had the trumpet loose the four
[3:29] angels which are bound in the great
[3:30] river Euphrates now I want to call your
[3:33] attention to some interesting things
[3:35] here in the scripture first is that
[3:37] there's a loosing and there's something
[3:39] there's some things that are bound in
[3:42] the great river euphrates when the four
[3:44] angels were loosed which were prepared
[3:46] for an hour and a day and a month and a
[3:48] gear it prepared just for exact moment
[3:51] in time to come on for to slay the third
[3:53] part of men that's a lot of men and the
[3:57] number of the army of the horsemen were
[3:59] two hundred thousand thousand that's two
[4:03] hundred million two hundred million and
[4:06] I heard the number of them and thus I
[4:08] saw the horses in the vision and then
[4:10] that set on them having a breast place
[4:12] of fire and of jacinth and a brimstone
[4:14] and the heads of the horses were as the
[4:16] heads of lions and out of their mouths
[4:18] issued three things fire and smoke and
[4:22] brimstone fire and smoke and brimstone
[4:25] by these three was the third part of men
[4:28] killed by the fire and by the smoke and
[4:30] by the brimstone which issued out of
[4:32] their mouths you may be seated the Lord
[4:36] is blessing to the reading of the word
[4:42] so as I you know this this dish trumpets
[4:47] good you know the last few times I've
[4:49] been preaching I kind of got into the
[4:51] kind of a pattern of how everything's
[4:55] laid out in the Bible how you start off
[4:57] and with the there's all the different
[4:58] feast days you starts off with a
[5:00] Passover and goes on to unleavened bread
[5:03] and the firstfruits Pentecost and then
[5:05] now we've been celebrating or Ellen do
[5:07] the Feast of Pentecost for seven church
[5:09] ages and then down at the end of things
[5:12] then it winds up with these last three
[5:15] feasts the Feast of Trumpets a feast of
[5:17] atonement or the Day of Atonement
[5:18] they're recognizing who this high priest
[5:21] is as it comes on the scene and the
[5:23] Feast of Tabernacles the body change or
[5:26] going into the Millennium all these that
[5:27] Andy at the end of the Feast of
[5:29] Tabernacles you go into the eighth day
[5:32] the holy convocation going on into the
[5:33] New Jerusalem the eighth day of the holy
[5:36] convocation but but I kind of drop back
[5:39] a little bit to this this particular
[5:41] feat this trumpet because I believe it
[5:45] kind of it kind of identifies something
[5:48] that that many of us are dealing with
[5:50] today you see in case you look at the
[5:53] trumpets and ain't no brother Brahm
[5:54] taught us that that the trumpets really
[5:57] are for Israel because they're there to
[5:58] bring Israel back to their homeland but
[6:01] yet when brother brown preached the
[6:03] Feast of the trumpets he would say
[6:04] things like especially about this
[6:05] trumpet he would say you know it
[6:09] it Unleashed something to natural Israel
[6:12] but then something to in the
[6:14] ecclesiastical realm to the bride if
[6:17] something began to unfold in the
[6:19] ecclesiastical realm to the bride and
[6:21] what what what you'll see is happening
[6:23] is that 200 million demons were
[6:26] Unleashed as they as they make their way
[6:28] through will say it's through society
[6:30] through through the ecclesiastical
[6:32] renown through the through the through
[6:34] Rome and through all the denominational
[6:36] children of Rome all making their way
[6:38] out until to try to attack the bride try
[6:43] to run it after the bride trying to the
[6:46] World Council of Churches trying to
[6:47] bring out all of these things I'm trying
[6:51] trying to get at the bride and God God
[6:55] defends the bride but just taking us out
[6:57] of the way you see the the bride and so
[7:02] he gives us he gives us a defense in the
[7:05] hour of trouble he gives us away when
[7:07] when the enemy comes up like comes in
[7:10] like a flood hey God the Bible says that
[7:12] he'll raise up a standard he'll come in
[7:14] and raise up a defense and what is that
[7:16] but what is the banner what is the
[7:18] banner that he raises the standard that
[7:20] he raises it is the word and so the
[7:22] defense against the demonic power the
[7:24] defense against the things that you see
[7:26] in your workplace the things that you
[7:28] see at school the things that you see
[7:30] really even in church
[7:32] that we're going to talk about a little
[7:33] bit because the Devils are were
[7:36] originally worship angels and so they
[7:38] like to be in church they like to
[7:40] situate themselves right amongst people
[7:42] where they can get in an atmosphere of
[7:43] worship so that the thing that the
[7:46] defense that God has given us in this
[7:48] hour is the Word of God and then this I
[7:51] think this trumpet is really significant
[7:53] because in this hour there's such a
[7:55] demonic power that comes against the
[7:58] bride that comes against the the the the
[8:02] children of Israel to drive them back
[8:03] into the homeland this such a demonic
[8:06] power has been loosed but now you think
[8:08] think on the flip side think about such
[8:11] a power that God has unleashed through
[8:13] the word that he's given it to us if
[8:15] we'll just open ourselves up to receive
[8:20] word for our day to allow it to have
[8:22] dominion in our lives then that can have
[8:25] that you can be delivered you can have a
[8:29] power in your life to withstand
[8:31] everything that the devil throws against
[8:33] you maybe bring to mind that quote that
[8:35] where brother Brown said that that a man
[8:37] can get so close to God and still the
[8:40] devil doesn't know what to do with it
[8:42] and so you really you see in this in
[8:44] this trumpet you see you see the devil
[8:47] throwing all that he's got at Israel at
[8:50] the 144,000 he's throwing all that he's
[8:53] got in the ecclesiastical ring home at
[8:55] the bride but no matter what he does
[8:57] that God raises up a standard to defend
[9:00] he raises up and he raises up his word
[9:04] now let me let me drop back here a
[9:07] second because you can see methylate was
[9:12] bringing out the other day there's
[9:14] there's these gaps in here that are so
[9:17] important but we're reading now that
[9:19] there's a world war and then there's
[9:21] another world war the sixth trumpet and
[9:24] then there's a gap between that sixth
[9:26] trumpet and the seventh trumpet when it
[9:29] sounds it's a voices in heaven were
[9:32] heard they said they declared that the
[9:34] kingdoms of this world have become the
[9:35] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ
[9:36] in other words the ever the whole thing
[9:38] is wiped away but between the sixth
[9:40] trumpet and the seventh trumpet
[9:42] something between the second world war
[9:44] and the third world war something
[9:47] special is happening and I believe
[9:50] what's happening is that you see there's
[9:53] these three things that take place first
[9:55] the revealing the preaching of the
[9:57] gospel and then that word that period
[10:00] the preaching of the gospel takes
[10:02] preeminence in the people that have been
[10:04] preached to and that is what is taking
[10:07] place now that preeminence of the gospel
[10:09] and the ones that have heard it and you
[10:11] and I those of you sitting here the word
[10:13] is becoming preeminent and you to give
[10:16] you power over coming power to
[10:18] everything that the devil throws at you
[10:20] and then the third thing that happens is
[10:22] the taking away see you've got the
[10:25] revealing the preeminence and the taking
[10:27] away the shout the voice and the Trump
[10:30] and the
[10:31] is the thing that's happening right now
[10:33] is that it's something taking place
[10:34] between the gap between the sixth and
[10:36] the seventh trumpet between the sixth
[10:39] seal and the seventh seal there will be
[10:42] a 144,000 that that come to preeminence
[10:45] that catch the revelation of the two
[10:47] witnesses and become the living
[10:50] manifestation of that word that they
[10:51] have heard just as you and I are
[10:53] becoming the living manifestation of the
[10:56] word that we have heard which makes you
[10:58] God in flesh for this day so we see
[11:03] we've got we've got here we've got a
[11:04] scene set up we've got Euphrates an army
[11:07] of horse horsemen widespread death
[11:10] spiritual death will say demonic power
[11:13] sweeping the land and you know the
[11:17] fourth seal shows a perfect Church with
[11:19] the Eagle anointing ready to take flight
[11:21] under the sixth seal we see two million
[11:23] deep demons loosed at the river
[11:25] Euphrates because why the 100 to get the
[11:30] 144,000 back to their homeland so that
[11:32] they can realize who Jesus Christ is and
[11:36] meanwhile the bride is recognizing who
[11:38] she is but she's also recognizing the
[11:42] tricks of the devil the tricks and traps
[11:44] of the devil you see all through
[11:52] Scripture the Bible tells us about how
[11:54] it is structure sin the way that the
[11:57] devil works it talks about how you come
[12:00] in like flatteries you're coming with
[12:01] with just a really small little thing
[12:03] that seems real insignificant James
[12:06] chapter 1 4 verse 14 it says but every
[12:09] man is tempted when he has drawn away of
[12:11] his own lust and enticed first this
[12:14] starts off as he's tempted and then he's
[12:17] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[12:19] then when lust hath conceived it
[12:23] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[12:26] finished bringeth forth death it starts
[12:30] off with just a little saying and before
[12:32] long it turns into you're actually
[12:34] performing a deed you're actually doing
[12:37] something and then the next thing that
[12:38] happens is well you're making a doctrine
[12:40] out of it and to have a doctrine you
[12:42] have to have a prophet a false prophet
[12:45] in this case a false prophet that can
[12:47] preach that false that false doctrine
[12:49] that can preach that doctrine and then
[12:52] it goes on to the actually manifest
[12:54] state manifesting that that what started
[12:57] out as a saying as the incarnate false
[12:59] prophet the incarnate thing and you see
[13:02] on the flipside God is doing the same
[13:04] thing you with what started off as just
[13:06] a little small thing where you first
[13:08] maybe turn the side to a little a little
[13:11] corner mission somewhere and you heard
[13:12] the gospel preached and you began to be
[13:14] justified and you really you realized
[13:17] that that you were a sinner and you came
[13:19] to the altar or maybe knelt down beside
[13:21] your bed at night and God began to
[13:23] reveal himself to you and the word began
[13:26] to take flesh today and you and you came
[13:28] to a sanctified condition where you you
[13:31] realize that that unclean spirit had
[13:33] left you and one thing one thing led to
[13:36] another and before long you came to live
[13:39] in a state of a living reality where the
[13:42] gospel was not something what you were
[13:43] wondering where the message was right or
[13:45] not but it became something that was
[13:48] steadfast and true and you where you
[13:50] didn't you are shaken by every wind of
[13:52] doctrine you are shaking you knew that
[13:55] the message was right you knew that God
[13:57] was real and then it becomes you keep
[13:59] moving on and on that what started off
[14:02] it's just just one little word Hebrews
[14:05] 13:8 one scripture that you heard
[14:08] Galatians 2:20 and it began to move on
[14:11] and grow and grow until you become the
[14:14] Incarnate Word for your day you become
[14:17] God made flesh that you see as the bride
[14:21] is becoming more and more like God as
[14:23] she looks into the mirror of God's Word
[14:25] and sees herself becoming more and more
[14:28] like her father like God himself she's
[14:31] becoming more and more equipped to
[14:34] withstand the wiles of the devil
[14:36] whatever the devil throws at her she
[14:39] could say listen it comes by experience
[14:42] to when you look back through your life
[14:44] and see all the tricks and the things
[14:46] that the devil's thrown at you and then
[14:48] you can see it moving in other people's
[14:50] lives experience is talking and you can
[14:52] say that's the devil you can identify
[14:54] him and say that's the devil moving
[14:57] and then it God equips you with how to
[14:59] approach the situation how to deal with
[15:01] a situation how to know what to do he's
[15:04] given you patience and knowledge in that
[15:06] hour he's given you tips to know how to
[15:09] approach others that maybe don't see
[15:11] things the same way that you do because
[15:13] he's equipped he's could quit the bride
[15:15] in the stage to withstand 200 million
[15:19] Devils that are coming after the bride I
[15:24] think you know one thing I know the kids
[15:28] that they had a wonderful time at the
[15:30] Louisiana camp this year and one thing
[15:33] that really struck the kids that struck
[15:35] me or we were we were kind of we got up
[15:37] Sunday morning and estra had texted mama
[15:40] and she said my goodness that was a
[15:44] devil that was manifested several devils
[15:46] that came into manifestation at the camp
[15:48] and and brother Aaron was there and he
[15:51] could tell you more about it later and
[15:52] everything well I was not because we
[15:54] were with brother Wade and whatnot but
[15:56] what it what that kind of thing does for
[15:58] the young people I believe is to cause
[16:00] them to realize that when we're coming
[16:03] to church and everything a lot there's a
[16:04] lot of things going on that you don't
[16:06] see there's a room that you don't see
[16:09] and maybe you get into a church service
[16:12] like that where things begin to be
[16:14] manifested and the devil begins to speak
[16:17] and the kids are sitting there listening
[16:18] to a devil speak back to the ministers
[16:20] and you begin to realize that there's
[16:22] more going on there's an unseen realm
[16:25] remember how brother Branham said we're
[16:27] looking to the unseen we're looking to a
[16:30] realm of faith a realm that's beyond the
[16:33] natural things that we can see there's
[16:36] something beyond just this mortal flesh
[16:38] that you can reach out and touch
[16:39] something beyond these things that we
[16:41] can we can touch with our natural eyes
[16:43] and hands and and our natural senses but
[16:47] there's things taking place in a realm
[16:49] that yet you're not even maybe aware of
[16:52] so maybe I want to call your attention
[16:54] tonight that the devil is here in this
[16:57] church right now sitting on the pews
[17:00] next to us but there's a God that's more
[17:02] powerful than anything that the devil
[17:04] can do
[17:05] there's a God that's able to deliver us
[17:07] from all the wiles of the devil
[17:10] but there is a devil the devil is real
[17:15] the devil is moving but God has given us
[17:18] a cooler equipment to be able to know
[17:21] what the devil's tricks are to be able
[17:24] to know how a devil is cast out how can
[17:28] yo you delivered everything how can how
[17:30] could anyone be delivered of the things
[17:32] that that so easily beset us how can you
[17:36] be delivered of alcoholism and cigarette
[17:38] smoking how could you be delivered of a
[17:41] lustful spirit how can you believe
[17:43] deliver to pornography if I'm looking at
[17:45] things that you should not be doing and
[17:46] look at the devil what make you think
[17:48] that there's no way out of it he'll
[17:50] chain you down to those things and look
[17:53] the problems the problems they kind of
[17:58] let me say this the right way as you go
[18:01] up the mountain the devil approaches you
[18:03] in different ways he'd approaches you in
[18:07] different ways to correspond to your
[18:09] immaturity as you go up this mountain
[18:12] where first of all first of all he was
[18:14] approaching you through through lust and
[18:17] and and and alcohol and cigarettes and
[18:19] all of those things watch as you move up
[18:21] the mountain he begins to come at you
[18:24] with different things and part of the
[18:26] Christian journey is to realize what
[18:28] he's doing when you begin to recognize
[18:30] the tricks of the devil when you begin
[18:32] to see what he's doing then you'll have
[18:34] an answer and the only answer the answer
[18:37] for the tricks of the devil's lies in
[18:39] the pages of this book and if you don't
[18:42] get into the pages of this book you will
[18:43] not know how to approach the devil you
[18:46] will not know his tactics you will not
[18:49] understand you'll have no knowledge of
[18:51] how to defend against him because see it
[18:58] is not by power or by might that's
[19:03] that's one of the may be the tricks of
[19:06] the Devils or just that made it a trick
[19:08] of just being a human a deception of
[19:11] just being a human as you begin to think
[19:13] that in your in your Christian journey
[19:15] you think while it's taking a long time
[19:17] for me to
[19:17] healed and so you begin to fall back on
[19:20] your own design on your own works if I
[19:23] if I can't be healed if it's taken a
[19:25] while for me to be healed maybe I need
[19:27] to take some more vitamin C maybe I need
[19:29] to go take some more all these pills and
[19:31] things maybe I need to go get a big old
[19:33] horrible prescription from the doctor
[19:34] and you begin to fault that ministers do
[19:37] this to listen you begin to fall back if
[19:40] God will come up on the scene and use my
[19:42] lips and use my body to speak maybe I
[19:45] can fall back on my own intellect maybe
[19:48] I can fall back on my own self if you
[19:50] begin to do that in your own Christian
[19:52] life if God won't come back on the scene
[19:54] for me maybe I could just do it myself
[19:56] but it's not by yourself it's not by
[19:59] your powers not by your own works it's
[20:02] just by the power of a living God that
[20:04] comes to a real word listen when the
[20:09] angel came to getting in and said you're
[20:12] gonna defeat the enemy as one man and
[20:14] getting in said how he gathered up a lot
[20:17] of people and and all the people forget
[20:20] the angel beginning to dwindle him down
[20:21] until there was only 300 left and I
[20:24] wonder if Gideon looked at that and he
[20:26] said well I thought that I was gonna do
[20:27] it by my old works by my old might by my
[20:31] own power but God had something else in
[20:33] store for him God was gonna show him
[20:36] that it's not by his works it's not by
[20:38] him it wasn't by his works the same
[20:41] thing with Samson everybody thinks
[20:43] Samson with this great big old huge like
[20:45] Arnold Schwarzenegger or something but
[20:47] brother Brent told us that Samson was a
[20:49] little pipsqueak he was a little
[20:51] somebody that a little seven of the
[20:53] brains running down the back of his neck
[20:54] a little mama's boy that within himself
[20:57] he had no power he didn't get in go out
[21:00] there lifting weights and everything but
[21:02] when it came time for him to lift up the
[21:04] gates of the city he ran over there and
[21:06] by the power of a holy God it wasn't
[21:08] that man that was holy running around
[21:10] committing adultery but the power of God
[21:13] in that man could come up on the scene
[21:15] and lift up those gates and carry it
[21:16] because you see it's not our power it's
[21:20] not our works that will save us it's not
[21:23] you trying to give or get rid of that
[21:25] that lust demon or that
[21:27] that whatever it is that you struggle
[21:29] with it's not you trying to get rid of
[21:31] the complexes and things that the devil
[21:34] is trying to overshadow your life where
[21:36] you're even afraid to come into the
[21:38] sanctuary and fellowship around other
[21:40] believers because you are afraid of what
[21:42] other people are thinking about you
[21:44] listen that kind of stuff is the devil
[21:46] that is the devil getting upon people
[21:48] and so and trying to sow discord and
[21:51] trying to get it
[21:52] impregnate people's minds with thoughts
[21:54] that thinks that to separate people to
[21:58] hinder the church service what we need
[22:02] is the power of the Living God to come
[22:05] down to get down inside of us and begin
[22:07] living through us and begin working his
[22:10] way out remember Moses thought that by
[22:17] his own works because of all his
[22:19] education because of all the things that
[22:20] he had inside of all the things that is
[22:22] maybe even as mama had taught him and
[22:24] she taught him right but he thought but
[22:27] that all that was going to save him that
[22:29] all that was going to deliver that
[22:30] children of Israel but it came down that
[22:33] when he was not equipped when he killed
[22:36] that Egyptian finally he met a pillar of
[22:40] fire
[22:41] remember Elijah Elisha by his own works
[22:46] but when he got that mantel on him and
[22:48] he said where is the god of Elisha and
[22:50] it wasn't himself that part of that
[22:53] River but it was the power of the same
[22:55] God that was with Elisha that came on
[22:57] the scene and part of the waters for him
[22:58] and he stepped across listen it's not by
[23:03] our own works that you know who will get
[23:06] so wrapped up and the things that we do
[23:09] that we can even start to think that
[23:11] like like Sarah sitting there in that
[23:14] tent when when the angel the Lord said
[23:18] why did Sarah laugh and brother Branham
[23:21] said God would have killed her except
[23:23] but yet she was a part of Abraham
[23:26] because she was a part of Abraham God
[23:29] could not kill her and because we are
[23:32] part of Christ because we were wrapped
[23:34] up inside of him he's inside of us and
[23:36] we're inside of him
[23:38] and so that that gives us protection
[23:41] remember the lost wife didn't have that
[23:43] same kind of protection that's why she
[23:46] was turned to a pillar of salt as they
[23:48] were they were leaving as she turned
[23:50] back but listen I'm gonna go off on a
[23:54] rabbit trail come on now let's read in
[23:57] 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 verse 12
[24:01] where Paul Paul was warning of the
[24:04] things that the devil will do he said
[24:06] but what I do that I will do that I may
[24:09] cut off occasion from them which desire
[24:11] occasion that we're in their glory they
[24:13] may be found even as we for such are
[24:17] false apostles deceitful workers
[24:19] transforming themselves into the
[24:22] apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[24:24] Satan himself is transformed into an
[24:27] angel of light therefore it is no great
[24:30] thing if his ministers also be
[24:32] transformed as the ministers of
[24:33] righteousness whose end shall be
[24:35] according to their works
[24:37] because you see what the best thing that
[24:39] the delicates that can imagine it to do
[24:42] it's just it's just so alive just like
[24:45] you did to Eve in the garden that's what
[24:49] I was talking about earlier the devil
[24:51] here where did where did that where did
[24:54] the demons originate they started off as
[24:56] angels and angels angels are associated
[24:59] that they're ministering spirits their
[25:01] worship angels they're associated with
[25:03] worship and so that angel that when the
[25:05] Angels became perverted that that
[25:08] Lucifer wrapped his old dragon tail
[25:10] around and around a third of them and
[25:12] pulled him to his side when they began
[25:13] to be perverted they they they're still
[25:18] like to be around worship they still
[25:20] like to get into a church atmosphere
[25:23] they still like to get amongst people
[25:25] and try to influence the worship service
[25:27] and hinder the worship service and the
[25:30] best way that they could think to do
[25:31] that is to get into a false prophet and
[25:33] begin to hinder the worship service by
[25:35] hindering because what what the devil's
[25:37] aim is to do is to cause people to
[25:39] disbelieve the Word of God to cause
[25:42] people to begin to sin to cause people
[25:44] to disbelieve Hebrews 4:12 says that the
[25:49] the answer to that is the war
[25:51] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[25:53] than any two-edged sword because what
[25:55] the Word of God goes out and it begins
[25:57] to preach against things that are in
[25:59] people's life and it causes the devil to
[26:01] bubble up and react because listen we're
[26:04] we're in a battle now it's a spiritual
[26:08] battle when the preaching of the gospel
[26:09] goes forth it because of the spirits to
[26:12] react it causes a reaction to things you
[26:15] see even to the dividing asunder of soul
[26:17] and spirit and of the joints and marrow
[26:19] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[26:21] intents of the heart
[26:22] neither is there any creature that is
[26:24] not manifest in this sight but all
[26:27] things are naked and open under their
[26:29] eyes of him with whom we have to do and
[26:32] you know what happens when the preaching
[26:33] of the gospel goes forth maybe many
[26:35] times that spirit of a complex or
[26:37] whatever will be on somebody and their
[26:39] feelings will get hurt and they'll begin
[26:41] to feel like they're getting preached on
[26:43] or whatever and they'll begin to maybe
[26:44] spread that thing to somebody else I
[26:46] feel like you know that they go outside
[26:49] and say I feel like that the preacher
[26:50] was real upset today he was real mean
[26:52] today and that complex will rise up and
[26:55] instead of getting delivered that person
[26:57] will baby that spirit I believe what we
[27:00] need to do is if you can realize when
[27:02] there's a problem in your life and and
[27:04] repent that's what the preaching of the
[27:06] gospel is for is to lead us to
[27:07] repentance to lead us to the altar to
[27:10] lead us to a confession because you know
[27:12] brother Branham said unless you confess
[27:14] unless you repent of your sins that
[27:16] devil has a right to stay right there if
[27:20] you don't realize that you keep babying
[27:21] and everything the devil will stay right
[27:23] there keep hitting in the church service
[27:25] keep keep messing with your spiritual
[27:28] wall keep preventing you from moving on
[27:30] keep preventing you from growing up in
[27:32] grace and knowledge you'll you your
[27:35] spiritual fellowship with God will stop
[27:37] right there
[27:39] until something is done see how does how
[27:47] does the devil get cast out many many
[27:51] times you think well we need to get it
[27:55] we need to get into some different kind
[27:56] of church services then we have around
[27:58] here if we could get into a church
[28:00] service that was real dynamic
[28:02] with a great move of God then things
[28:04] would really happen but see that's not
[28:06] the way that the devil comes out the
[28:08] devil how does it ever come out in
[28:10] Matthew chapter 18 verse 16 when the
[28:12] even was come they brought unto Him many
[28:14] that were possessed with devils and he
[28:17] cast out the spirits with his word and
[28:20] healed all that were sick with his word
[28:23] he cast it out and you know many times
[28:25] that's so hard for us to believe so hard
[28:28] to believe that that is the way that God
[28:31] casts out Devils that you know even just
[28:35] listening to the things that went on a
[28:36] camp the devil would not come out until
[28:39] that brother or sister confessed that
[28:42] there was something wrong the devil
[28:44] would not come out until the word was
[28:46] brought to that person the devil will
[28:48] not come out until the word is preached
[28:51] the word has to be preached because the
[28:53] devil cannot abide in the presence of
[28:55] the word that's don't you realize that's
[28:58] what the seven seals revealed the seven
[29:00] seals revealed the word has gone into
[29:02] you the word has been packed into you
[29:04] until the devil has come out the word
[29:07] was kept puts put into you until as
[29:09] sanctification the baby formed
[29:10] sanctification the unclean spirit went
[29:13] out and the word just keeps piling on
[29:15] until you go into a more mature form of
[29:18] justification and the devil leaves
[29:20] The Devil's coming out he's riding away
[29:23] listen I believe that every born-again
[29:25] Christian in here has an experience
[29:28] where you can look back and remember
[29:29] when the devil went out you could
[29:32] remember when your desires changed you
[29:35] could remember when that unclean spirit
[29:37] went out see you see we always were
[29:40] looking at kind of the attributes of the
[29:42] devil and that's one of the attributes
[29:43] of the devil is he's got to have
[29:46] somebody that work through and so yep
[29:49] maybe maybe we all have an appropriate
[29:51] amount of concern this evening because
[29:53] when the devil goes out of one person
[29:56] he's going to look for somebody else to
[29:58] get into remembering the prayer lines
[30:02] and things brother Branham would say
[30:03] don't look up because your eyes are the
[30:06] gateway to the soul and the devil will
[30:09] either get in at one place he said you
[30:11] can cause that devil to come
[30:12] back on that person by disrespecting the
[30:15] service would you realize that when a
[30:19] devil comes out when a devil comes out
[30:23] and listen when we come to church we're
[30:25] not many times people come to church and
[30:26] they think that we're just kind of
[30:28] coming to church to get together but
[30:30] we're coming to church like we're coming
[30:31] to a hospital we're coming to be
[30:33] delivered of sickness we're coming to be
[30:35] delivered of spiritual infirmities we're
[30:38] coming to be straightened up we're
[30:39] coming to be patched up we're coming to
[30:41] be we're coming to be tended to by the
[30:43] medics so that the medic can say
[30:45] something's wrong with you and and and
[30:48] then the person says well I realize
[30:50] something's wrong with me now patch me
[30:52] I'll tell me what I need to do to get
[30:54] better listen I believe sometimes we we
[30:59] don't want to hear the truth presented
[31:01] in the way that it should be we don't
[31:02] only hear it preached in a way that
[31:04] we're where I was preached in a way that
[31:07] you need to die out to yourself you need
[31:10] to give up and let God take a hold of
[31:12] you repent repent of all the things that
[31:15] you've done confess your sins so that
[31:19] God could come in and make a new
[31:21] creature out of you but instead instead
[31:26] what people hang onto ER or we want to
[31:29] hang on to little feelings and things
[31:31] instead of a revealed word instead of a
[31:34] living reality instead of a steadfast
[31:36] hope lying down on the inside of your
[31:38] soul let's read first kings chapter 22
[31:48] verse 7 there we go the times creeping
[31:53] up on me again I'm not even through my
[31:58] first page that's all right no I
[32:04] wouldn't bother we'll be fine first
[32:09] Kings chapter 22 verse 2 says we talk
[32:13] about casting out Devils and what the
[32:16] devil does when he gets in amongst the
[32:18] people and it came to pass in the third
[32:20] year that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
[32:22] came down to the king of Israel and the
[32:23] king of Israel said unto his servant
[32:25] no you there a month and gilja desires
[32:27] and we be still and take it not out of
[32:29] the hand of the king of syria and he
[32:32] said unto Jehoshaphat will that go with
[32:34] me to battle to ramoth-gilead and
[32:35] Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel I
[32:37] am as thou art my people as died people
[32:40] my horses as thy horses and Jehoshaphat
[32:43] said unto the king of Israel inquire I
[32:44] pray thee other word of the Lord today
[32:46] then the king of Israel gathered the
[32:48] prophets together about four hundred men
[32:50] and said unto them shall I go against
[32:52] ramoth-gilead to battle or shall I
[32:54] forbear and they said go up for the Lord
[32:56] shall deliver it into the hand of the
[32:57] king
[32:58] four hundred prophets that they were
[33:02] trusted in to bring them the word of the
[33:04] Lord and it was only one man in the land
[33:07] that could bring the true word of the
[33:08] Lord
[33:08] hey listen you start reading the message
[33:11] about how brother bro talked about how
[33:13] it's honing down time and how it was
[33:16] going to get so dark in this last stage
[33:19] that he said I left a little light and
[33:22] so you began to look around is there
[33:24] anybody you can almost get despondent is
[33:28] there anybody preaching the true message
[33:30] of the gospel that preaching the truth
[33:32] is there anybody that has the real Word
[33:35] of God and what I mean you know there's
[33:39] so many today I'm just going to preach
[33:42] it that's so many today that are
[33:44] preaching that you must be born again
[33:46] you must be a good Christian you lay
[33:50] aside the waste so every easily beset
[33:51] you but how many are preaching I'm
[33:54] gospel that will take us into a body
[33:56] change when you look around and search
[33:58] for somebody that I preached it real
[34:00] true gospel little skin The Devil's hide
[34:02] then lay lay waste to the devil that'll
[34:05] clean you clean up lives and that will
[34:08] get us to a place where we can take a
[34:10] rapture it looks like it we're just
[34:13] about in the same kind of condition that
[34:15] they were and you see why and they in a
[34:17] moment because in this story it was
[34:19] because way up there in heaven and the
[34:21] scene
[34:22] God said who who can go down and a lion
[34:27] spirit came up a line spirit came up and
[34:30] got up amongst all than me and you see
[34:32] what heart what harm the devil can cause
[34:34] what harm
[34:37] one false prophet could call when he
[34:39] gets in amongst two people listen just
[34:41] one one little sister sowing discord one
[34:46] little sister preaching a false doctrine
[34:48] to our children or one little sister
[34:51] preaching a false doctrine to our family
[34:53] and saying stuff that ain't even in the
[34:55] Bible like you can't be saved unless you
[34:58] do this or that
[34:59] you'll never be saved if you came from a
[35:02] bastard Union
[35:03] you'll never be saved unless you divorce
[35:06] this spouse or whatever listen all that
[35:08] junk is tommyrot and you can send more
[35:11] souls to hell cause more people to leave
[35:14] the message through all that nonsense
[35:16] some little person trying to trying to
[35:19] be you can turn yourself into a false
[35:21] prophet real easy get into a condition
[35:23] where your you think you're doing good
[35:26] but instead it's the devil working in
[35:29] your life listen I'm just gonna preach
[35:35] somebody saying something that they feel
[35:38] is helpful but then turn around and
[35:41] years later that's caused people to
[35:43] leave the message cause people to feel
[35:45] like that all hope is gone because of
[35:47] one careless remark what's one little
[35:50] thing that was just slung out just well
[35:52] I'm sorry but there's no hope for you
[35:55] because of the way that you came into
[35:57] the world I'm sorry but there's no help
[35:59] listen to all this there's so much of
[36:01] that stuff going around it just makes my
[36:04] blood curl just about just one false
[36:08] prophet could lead more Souls a hell if
[36:10] just one word off in the beginning
[36:12] started the whole thing see what one
[36:16] word off can do now I'm sorry I'm sorry
[36:21] but I don't think there's grace for you
[36:23] I'm sorry you know what I say to
[36:27] somebody that has heard a message like
[36:29] that from a well-meaning person cuz you
[36:32] need to come to church where the gospel
[36:33] is preached so that you can hear the
[36:35] grace you listen whenever you see the
[36:37] word truth in the Bible just about every
[36:40] time it's preceded by the word mercy
[36:42] mercy and truth mercy in truth if we
[36:45] just
[36:45] if we were just confronted by the word
[36:47] truth we'd be slaying every one of us
[36:50] would be killed every one of us if we
[36:52] stood before truth but God gave us his
[36:54] mercy he presented his mercy to us and I
[36:58] thank God for his mercy that is given to
[37:00] us he died on the cross so that we could
[37:03] have mercy He gave His life so that we
[37:05] could have mercy and the only thing that
[37:07] you the only requirement for their mercy
[37:10] is to believe on Him they died for you
[37:12] [Applause]
[37:18] that's reader let's keep reading verse 7
[37:22] and Josephus it is there not a prophet
[37:24] of the Lord besides that we might
[37:26] inquire of him and the king of Israel
[37:28] said in Jehoshaphat there is yet one man
[37:30] Micah the son of imlah
[37:31] but who may we may acquire of the Lord
[37:34] but I hate him for he does not prophesy
[37:36] good concerning me but evil listen I
[37:39] spent many times people hate the very
[37:42] thing that will deliver them from the
[37:45] thing from the weight that the devil has
[37:47] put on their back from the all of the
[37:50] cares and the complexes and things they
[37:53] hate coming to church because they feel
[37:55] like the devil is didn't feel like the
[37:59] dead that the preacher is preaching on
[38:01] them they feel like listen many times
[38:04] that is the greatest mercy that God can
[38:06] give on to you it's for a preacher to
[38:08] preach upon the waste the things that
[38:11] are in your life to expose the devil let
[38:18] me skip down here I'm running out of
[38:20] time let's skip down to verse 19 or uh
[38:30] yeah verse 19 and he said and he said
[38:35] hear thou therefore the word of the Lord
[38:37] I saw the Lord sitting on his throne and
[38:39] all the hosts of heaven standing by him
[38:41] on his right hand and on his left and
[38:43] the Lord said who shall persuade I have
[38:46] that meeting he may go up and fall at a
[38:48] Rhema for Gilead and one said on this
[38:51] manner and another set on that manner
[38:54] and they came for the spirit and stood
[38:57] before the Lord I said I will
[38:59] sweetie could you imagine this
[39:01] conversation going on up in heaven one
[39:04] said this and another said that and then
[39:06] out came a line spirit to say I will go
[39:09] and and spread this thing down there and
[39:13] the Lord said unto Him where with and he
[39:15] said I will go forth and I will be a
[39:17] lying spirit in the mouth of all his
[39:20] prophets and he said thou shalt persuade
[39:23] him and prevail also go forth and do so
[39:26] now and and we read the rest of the
[39:29] story but listen what is your defense
[39:34] I guess the false prophet what is your
[39:37] defense what kind of defense has God
[39:39] given you in this day how are you to
[39:42] know when a lying spirit goes forth it
[39:44] says something that caught that is
[39:46] contrary to the word your defense is the
[39:49] Word of God
[39:50] that's why I'd Ephesians it says to gird
[39:53] yourselves with truth to take up the
[39:55] shield of faith and the sword of the
[39:57] word to put on the helmet of salvation
[40:00] and put prepare put on the the feet of
[40:03] the preparation of your feet the
[40:05] preparation of the gospel of peace to
[40:07] prepare yourself against the defense of
[40:10] these things to make yourself ready so
[40:13] that you are prepared and they are when
[40:15] these things come upon when you hear
[40:17] some kind of thing going forth because
[40:19] look look see what the devil does his
[40:22] tactic is to make it so that you don't
[40:24] see clearly so listen to many times you
[40:27] look at somebody that you know is it's
[40:29] got a devil working in their life and
[40:31] they don't see things the way that they
[40:33] really are the conversation that they
[40:36] have the way that they that they say
[40:39] things it's like they're they're living
[40:41] in a distorted reality they don't see
[40:44] the love that others project they don't
[40:46] see the help that others want to give
[40:48] all they see is that somebody's out to
[40:50] get them and that's why brother Branham
[40:52] said that God has given us our selves in
[40:55] this day he's given us ourselves to open
[40:58] up our eyes like that balm that Jeremiah
[41:00] was talking about is there no balm in
[41:03] Gilead physician balm the kind of eyes
[41:06] that will open up your eyes by removing
[41:09] the devil and that's what the preaching
[41:11] of the gospel does the preaching of the
[41:13] gospel will cast out the devil so that
[41:16] the devil can leave and you can see and
[41:18] then you can believe and you keep moving
[41:21] forward
[41:24] listen I I think that's maybe the thing
[41:27] in this hour we don't realize when the
[41:30] devil is moving we don't realize when
[41:33] the devil is getting among us just like
[41:34] Peter didn't win in Matthew chapter 16
[41:37] verses 23 to 24 when when Peter was
[41:39] talking and it looked like he had a good
[41:41] idea you don't have to die and
[41:43] everything and Jesus turned to him and
[41:45] he said get thee behind me Satan thou
[41:48] art and a fence unto me listen maybe you
[41:51] feel like you've had a lot of things
[41:53] preached on you and nothing's done to
[41:55] you but you've never had the Lord Jesus
[41:57] say you are an offense to me you've
[41:59] never had the Lord Jesus himself said
[42:01] get thee behind me Satan and look Peter
[42:04] didn't realize that it was Satan
[42:06] motivating him Satan himself motivating
[42:11] the his thought process motivated the
[42:14] way he wasn't the only way that that
[42:16] would get off him is if somebody spoke
[42:18] to him direct and said get out of here
[42:20] devil for thou savourest not the things
[42:23] that be of God but those that be of men
[42:26] this said Jesus and his disciples If any
[42:29] man will come after me let him deny
[42:30] himself and take up his cross and follow
[42:33] me
[42:33] and you know I went I went through all
[42:35] the messages and things where brother
[42:37] Branham talked about what the devil will
[42:39] tell you the devil will say yes but it's
[42:41] written in the scriptures and it'll say
[42:44] he said to Eve surely you'll not die now
[42:46] these are all things I just went through
[42:48] finding and the message where brother
[42:50] Rama said the devil said and he'll say
[42:52] that's as far as you're going and he'll
[42:55] say if thou be the Son of God like he
[42:57] said to Jesus if now but if you really
[42:59] say that you're a Christian won't you do
[43:01] a miracle if you really say that this is
[43:04] a Church of the Living God why don't we
[43:06] see all kind of people falling out in
[43:07] the aisles and running around and stuff
[43:09] why don't you do me a miracle that's the
[43:11] Bible so this is another thing he said
[43:13] that's a Bible scholar so I better give
[43:16] him some scripture that's a Bible
[43:19] scholar so I better give him some
[43:20] scripture and he said
[43:22] I'll make him curse you to your face
[43:24] about job all these things that the
[43:27] devil will come listen think about that
[43:29] that's a Bible scholar so I better give
[43:31] him scripture and defy scripture
[43:34] scripture you better have more than just
[43:36] a head knowledge you better have a real
[43:38] revelation that a revelation of the word
[43:41] that's just given it God has given in
[43:43] this hour look at that clock everybody
[43:50] doing all right y'all y'all are hanging
[43:52] in there pretty good with me hang on
[43:55] there just a little bit longer because
[43:57] look look I was saying earlier about the
[43:59] devil will approach you with different
[44:01] tactics as you move up the mountain as
[44:03] you keep going up let's look at some of
[44:06] those tactics like let's read quote
[44:08] number 9 and the mrs. expectation and
[44:15] how today that we've got away from that
[44:17] he said that they got they go to church
[44:20] and this woman she went into the church
[44:23] out there we're starting out a real
[44:26] little baby for him she's done a very
[44:28] good job she was a piano player my sheep
[44:30] she was a piano player and she probably
[44:33] thought that in her spirit she she had
[44:35] something you real spiritual going on
[44:38] and after a while she began to notice
[44:40] the women in her neighborhood begin to
[44:42] dress immodestly
[44:43] how they get out and move their yards
[44:45] with him a little old clothes on you see
[44:47] that's the same problem that Jehoshaphat
[44:49] had he got around all them unbelievers
[44:52] and went down into the battle and just
[44:54] about got in trouble remember how the
[44:56] story of Jehoshaphat goes that the men
[44:59] were looking for Ahab on the battlefield
[45:01] and and they saw Jehoshaphat and they
[45:03] were running after him and then they
[45:05] realized that what they have so they
[45:06] went running after a-c-c out listening
[45:09] to other people getting into the Mount
[45:10] wrong Society can let us spirit jump on
[45:12] you and you'll be on all kinds of
[45:14] trouble she began to notice the women in
[45:19] her neighborhood begin to dress him
[45:21] honestly how they get out and mow their
[45:23] yards with them to low clothes on I hope
[45:25] there's none of them here tonight and
[45:26] it's a disgrace to you too sister God be
[45:29] merciful to your sinful soul what else
[45:32] would do that but an evil spirit
[45:35] of lust you don't want to think that but
[45:38] that's exactly the only person that ever
[45:41] stripped their clothes in the Bible was
[45:43] a maniac let's go quickly divert to
[45:46] number 10 he's talking about evil
[45:48] spirits and what what let's go on up on
[45:52] up a level you hear the gospel and you
[45:55] come to church and you want to be a
[45:56] Christian let's see what the devil does
[45:57] there and the only thing that kept me
[46:01] from being a saved when I was 12 years
[46:03] old because of spirit hung over me a
[46:06] devil saying wait a little while longer
[46:09] they see what the devil does he distorts
[46:12] your reality he just he's telling you
[46:14] just wait a little while longer you got
[46:16] plenty of time to go out and have fun to
[46:19] get amongst all your friends and listen
[46:21] to all the tommyrot that they're telling
[46:23] you missing up you're not just your
[46:26] spiritual life but your natural life too
[46:28] telling you all kind of bad advice and
[46:30] you can listen to all that and just go
[46:32] completely in the wrong direction wait a
[46:35] little while longer that's the reason
[46:36] you wasn't saved when you become the age
[46:38] of accountability a spirit you got in a
[46:41] crowd and that hovered over you and kept
[46:44] hanging over you you wanted to do right
[46:46] there's not a man that's got is right
[46:48] mind but wants to do right but there is
[46:51] something won't let you do right and
[46:53] what will deliver you of that this is
[46:56] the same thing that will diva delivery
[46:57] of all the other spirits is here in the
[47:00] world of God preached and I'm preaching
[47:02] tonight that now is the hour of
[47:05] deliverance now is the time to deliver
[47:07] dove delivers don't don't wait another
[47:09] moment just open up your heart and
[47:12] receive the word for your age but let's
[47:14] keep let's keep moving on up let's go to
[47:16] number 11 in Revelation chapter 5 number
[47:19] 1 and he said I got all kind of letters
[47:21] that's coming in the last few date now
[47:23] here we're going to get into something
[47:25] something a little bit higher up because
[47:28] now he's talking about people that
[47:30] believe his message now he's talking
[47:33] about people that believe that God sent
[47:36] a prophet and and he's gonna call it out
[47:39] you got a devil on you people that are
[47:42] sitting in message churches believing
[47:44] that he is a prophet friends of
[47:47] yes and he said I got all kind of
[47:50] letters that's come in the last few days
[47:51] and calls from different places so
[47:53] saying that I was Christ brethren that
[47:57] is a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of
[48:00] the devil see I am your brother and he
[48:04] goes on let's read on down down to verse
[48:07] quoted paragraph 38 and I wondered if it
[48:11] would have been some enemy of mine it
[48:13] would been all right but I would have
[48:15] just laughed at it and went on when it
[48:18] come to be precious brothers precious
[48:21] sisters then that's what hurt me and I
[48:25] said Lord the great thing is - great
[48:27] I'll just have to walk out and let's
[48:29] keep reading on down to the next
[48:30] highlighted area he said now wherever it
[48:33] is it's a spirit on precious people many
[48:37] people has asked me that but it's a
[48:39] spirit but I hope that today that it
[48:41] receives a deadly wound and will die out
[48:44] quickly so I can return back to the
[48:47] ministry listen you think you think just
[48:49] because you're sitting in a message
[48:51] church and believing that God sent a
[48:54] prophet you're believing a message
[48:56] preacher that God that a devil can't
[48:59] come on you listen I hope that that
[49:03] ought to be proof enough you can be
[49:05] sitting in a message church even with a
[49:08] new birth down inside of your soul and a
[49:10] spirit of jealousy come upon you a
[49:13] spirit of enmity toward somebody else
[49:15] you can start thinking hateful thoughts
[49:17] through somebody and what you need to do
[49:19] that's when you that's when you need to
[49:20] think before you take communion because
[49:23] brother Branham said you have no right
[49:24] to take communion and if you're not
[49:26] living the same life out there that you
[49:28] are here at church everywhere down on
[49:31] the inside out in public it's all gonna
[49:33] be in harmony and so when you get an
[49:35] enmity with your brother and sister
[49:36] because there's a spirit on you or
[49:39] something then it's time to take make it
[49:40] right before you come and take communion
[49:42] it's time to come and make that right
[49:46] and then he even said that he has spirit
[49:52] on
[49:54] what brother ball hold all now let's
[49:57] read let's read quote number 12 where in
[50:01] the word became flesh and I kind of
[50:02] combine these two together I want to ask
[50:05] the church one more thing before we get
[50:07] someplace to study in the scriptures
[50:08] that is that you'll pray for me
[50:10] I've developed a critical spirit and it
[50:13] holds sent me thinking about being
[50:15] haunted by a critical spirit and you
[50:18] know that's a bad thing you know a
[50:19] critical spirit a critical spirit will
[50:21] make you judge your other people without
[50:23] any evidence
[50:24] it'll make you jump to conclusions and
[50:27] you remember you remember brother Brent
[50:29] when he was talking about temperance he
[50:31] said temperance one of the things and
[50:34] that is not jumping to conclusions you
[50:37] go back and look at the statue for
[50:39] perfect man and so listen if you start
[50:41] judging everybody just because of the
[50:44] way that you think it is the way that
[50:46] you think you you're so critical and
[50:48] everything the Bible says you the way
[50:50] that you meet it out is the way it will
[50:52] be meted back to you the way that you
[50:55] judge others and you go tattletale into
[50:57] everybody else I think that brother I
[50:59] think they got something against me and
[51:01] that just stirs up a big old thing in
[51:03] the church and the body of discretes a
[51:05] big old schism and then you really are
[51:07] stirring the skids of Boston and it
[51:13] holds hit me he said I told my wife
[51:14] yesterday the first time something
[51:16] happened now and I was sitting in the
[51:18] yard and I told her she had a reminded
[51:21] me and I told her about it I said honey
[51:22] I've got to a place till I become
[51:25] critical of people I don't want to be
[51:27] let's keep going down to the next quote
[51:29] because that was in the morning and then
[51:31] in the evening he said this I'm not
[51:33] going to ask you how many made the
[51:35] consecration but I made me believe many
[51:37] of you did and myself I did in my heart
[51:39] Lord take that critical spirit from me
[51:42] now I listen a prophet of God asking to
[51:46] be delivered from a critical spirit
[51:48] asking for people to pray for him listen
[51:54] I'm gonna say this about prayer I
[51:56] believe you you start talking thinking
[51:58] about brother Branham in the prayer line
[51:59] and he said demons would call to one
[52:02] another for help
[52:03] demons would call to one another for
[52:05] help and listen a sane of God
[52:08] can call for help too and that's what we
[52:10] do when we put the prayer quit self
[52:12] referred to brother tears to read that's
[52:14] what we do and we go out in the parking
[52:15] lots they remember me in prayer we're
[52:17] calling for help we call for help from
[52:19] one another and we go at night when
[52:21] you're laying down or in the early in
[52:23] the morning whatever your prayer time is
[52:24] and we begin to call out to God
[52:25] interceding for one another honor on the
[52:28] behalf of one another we're calling now
[52:30] for help to one another one we're crying
[52:32] out to God and I believe that's what a
[52:34] real Christian should do is you enter in
[52:36] on behalf of one another because you
[52:38] love one another and let me tell you
[52:40] this that will get rid of all the devils
[52:42] because there's perfect love that casts
[52:44] out fear person perfect love it's got
[52:47] really is what gets rid of evil spirits
[52:49] didn't that what the word is that's what
[52:52] the word is it's love when love comes in
[52:54] and he said it myself I did in my heart
[52:57] Lord take that critical spirit for me
[52:58] now I don't criticize people out to
[53:00] their face but in my heart I do I see a
[53:02] lady walking down the street I'm
[53:05] especially that is she's not dressed
[53:06] properly I say isn't that awful and my
[53:09] heart I don't say it nobody else after
[53:12] all that's her business and he goes on
[53:14] well listen the reason that I feel
[53:17] compelled let's go on to that next quote
[53:18] pull that quote up the reason that this
[53:20] has been on my heart lately the reason I
[53:22] felt compelled to preach this sermon
[53:24] tonight but it's really because of this
[53:26] quote the things that brother Adam says
[53:28] in this quote now look at this I'm I
[53:31] have to magnify it now remember this
[53:33] Christ in the true church is a
[53:35] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[53:38] book of Revelation shoes the book of
[53:40] Revelation that we're just reading from
[53:42] shows how that the Antichrist spirit
[53:44] will come into the church and defile it
[53:46] making it lukewarm formal and power how
[53:50] does he do that because you think you
[53:52] just come in to church you just come
[53:53] into it to a thing instead of dying out
[53:56] to your sins coming here to the heart of
[53:58] the spiritual hospital to be delivered
[54:00] of evil spirits to grow up into the
[54:03] admonition of God to be formed in His
[54:05] image and look he said it exposes Satan
[54:09] revealing his works what does his works
[54:12] the attempted destruction of God's
[54:13] people and the discrediting of God's
[54:16] Word right down to the time he is cast
[54:19] into the lake of fire
[54:20] he fights that
[54:22] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[54:24] people get the true revelation of the
[54:26] true church and what she is what she
[54:30] stands for and that she can do the
[54:32] greater works she will be an invincible
[54:34] army now that's usually where we stop
[54:37] reading that quote when we when we talk
[54:39] about it we talk about when we can
[54:41] realize what a what God has done for us
[54:44] that we are the Word made flesh that the
[54:46] Son of Man is revealed in this day that
[54:47] all of these things and we stop right
[54:50] there but listen there's more to it if
[54:52] they get a true revelation of the two
[54:56] spirits within the framework of the
[54:58] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[55:00] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[55:03] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[55:07] her he will be as definitely thwarted
[55:10] today is when Christ withstood is every
[55:13] effort to gain power over him in the
[55:15] desert yes the Satan hates Revelation
[55:18] but we love it with true revelation in
[55:21] our lives the gates of Hell cannot
[55:24] prevail against it us but we will
[55:26] prevail over them do you see what he's
[55:28] talking about he's talking about a
[55:30] church that has been built up to a place
[55:32] that when the devil throws fiery darts
[55:35] enter they're just sticking her shield
[55:37] they just bounce off they can't
[55:39] penetrate they can't get to her because
[55:42] she recognizes the tricks of the devil
[55:44] and what I'm talking about is some
[55:47] believer that when somebody comes and
[55:49] tries to soothe discord
[55:51] they recognize it and turn it down
[55:53] listen I don't want to listen to that I
[55:55] don't want to listen to you talking
[55:56] about somebody else I don't want to
[55:58] listen to you talking about my pastor I
[56:00] don't wanna listen to you're talking
[56:01] about in another Minister I don't want
[56:03] none of that feel that none of that
[56:04] Tommy rod because it'll just go just
[56:06] weak in the church and it just soso
[56:09] schism and sow discord and listen you
[56:12] can cast out the devil from your church
[56:15] from your assembly from your home by an
[56:18] approach like that because that is love
[56:20] the same kind of perfect love that Jesus
[56:22] told Peter get thee behind me Satan
[56:25] listen that was love a lot of times we
[56:27] want to make we want to rap love
[56:29] do a little Hallmark card that we can
[56:31] distribute blow them undo a little
[56:32] psychological package but love is the
[56:35] word of God love is obedience to the
[56:37] Word of God expressed whether it pierces
[56:41] whether it cuts whether it hurts I want
[56:44] that kind of love in my life let me see
[56:53] goodness gracious I'm gonna have to skip
[56:56] over some of this I'm trying to get to
[57:01] that scripture that I first read in
[57:04] Revelation let's go to Zechariah chapter
[57:13] 4 verse 69 and it might take you a while
[57:15] to find that or whatever that's alright
[57:17] I'm just going to read it because listen
[57:21] this is a little scripture about about
[57:25] God building up this statue of a perfect
[57:28] man man not by your own works not by
[57:32] your own efforts but by the power of a
[57:35] Living God and then the answer is
[57:37] speaking to me this is the word of the
[57:39] Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might
[57:41] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[57:43] Lord of Hosts who art thou a great
[57:46] mountain before is the rule thou shalt
[57:49] also become a plain how your lie I know
[57:51] y'all I wasn't the world is it got to do
[57:52] with casting out Devils
[57:53] hang on say no and he shall bring forth
[57:56] a headstone thereof with shoutings
[57:58] crying grace grace unto it moreover the
[58:03] word of the Lord came unto me saying the
[58:04] hands of Zerubbabel have laid the
[58:06] foundation of this house his hands shall
[58:09] also finish it so he's talking about
[58:11] he's talking about laying a foundation
[58:13] and building up building up this thing
[58:17] out of the earth building up this
[58:19] mountain out of the earth just like New
[58:22] Jerusalem it comes down from God out of
[58:25] heaven onto a mountain that came out of
[58:28] the earth where God comes down on mount
[58:30] Olive's and sit puts one foot on the
[58:31] mountain and it's cleaving into and out
[58:33] of the earth just like this mountain is
[58:35] coming out of your
[58:37] and then New Jerusalem comes down and
[58:39] sets on and what is in New Jerusalem in
[58:41] New Jerusalem is a river of life because
[58:44] when Jesus talked to the woman at the
[58:45] well he said I'll give you well Springs
[58:47] of everlasting life
[58:48] I'll give you well Springs of water in
[58:51] New Jerusalem coming out of that room
[58:53] we're going down into five different
[58:55] branches is a river that goes throughout
[58:58] that permeates every part of that city
[59:00] you say what's this got to do with that
[59:02] chapter in Revelation well it's got
[59:04] something to do with that river
[59:06] Euphrates because you see that river
[59:08] Euphrates is the antithesis the opposite
[59:12] of this river of life that is in this
[59:14] New Jerusalem City this river of life
[59:17] that is flowing through you
[59:24] let's read oh I'm trying to finish let's
[59:28] read quote number 18 and blasphemous
[59:31] names we're sisters Shepherd she dreamed
[59:33] a dream and she dreamed she was up on a
[59:35] mountain and in this mountain the best I
[59:37] haven't gotten the paper before me but I
[59:39] think it's like this she dreamed that
[59:40] she saw a Rock box like a framework
[59:43] sitting right on top of this mountain
[59:45] and her husband was just behind her she
[59:47] saw a large man standing there with work
[59:49] clothes on sleeves rolled up baling the
[59:51] most pure water that she ever seen and
[59:54] pouring it into this box this rock box
[59:56] sitting on top of the mountain and the
[59:58] rock box would not hold the water and it
[1:00:01] rolled right out of there just bowled up
[1:00:03] all the trash and sticks and everything
[1:00:04] in there and bowled it out and rolled
[1:00:07] down the mountain because you see that
[1:00:09] River of Life that New Jerusalem River
[1:00:12] it was pushing out all the trash in your
[1:00:15] life that New Jerusalem River is is
[1:00:18] pushing out all of the demonic influence
[1:00:21] all of the demonic and power are
[1:00:23] everything out of you everything
[1:00:26] everything that would hinder you you see
[1:00:28] and she start down there where I got a
[1:00:30] highlight and she saw five streams of
[1:00:32] this pure crystal water not contaminated
[1:00:35] by the things that he had went through
[1:00:36] still pure and clear coming swiftly then
[1:00:40] it slowed up then almost fading out and
[1:00:42] she was wondering would it ever reached
[1:00:44] the bottom of the mountain five streams
[1:00:47] and she's looking at a statue of a
[1:00:49] perfect man
[1:00:51] but there's a mountain in New Jerusalem
[1:00:52] where we will live that John saw coming
[1:00:54] down from God out of heaven like a bride
[1:00:56] of doing for a husband because that is
[1:00:58] the bride that's the bride as a
[1:01:00] spiritual a spiritual look at the bride
[1:01:02] it's the same thing in Revelation
[1:01:05] chapter 22 and it said and he shows me
[1:01:08] showed me a pure river of water of life
[1:01:10] clear as crystal proceeding out of the
[1:01:13] throne of God and of the Lamb and then
[1:01:15] go to number 21 the future home and it
[1:01:18] said and all up and down here will be
[1:01:19] the redeemed there will be the houses of
[1:01:22] pure gold that will be avenues and parks
[1:01:24] and gardens and the river of life coming
[1:01:27] trickling out from the throne and
[1:01:29] running down through little chasms
[1:01:31] chasms and over the terraces and the
[1:01:33] tree of life will be blooming in every
[1:01:36] yard and bear its fruits 12 times a year
[1:01:39] a changed fruit every month a tree of
[1:01:42] life coming out and look look then this
[1:01:45] sixth trumpet we just read about a river
[1:01:47] another kind of river we're talking
[1:01:50] about demons bound at the great river
[1:01:54] euphrates this griever Euphrates that if
[1:01:57] you go back I'm trying to hurt here this
[1:01:59] river Euphrates that you could run back
[1:02:01] all the way to I don't know where the
[1:02:04] natural river started but I know where
[1:02:06] the spiritual head of this river started
[1:02:08] it started in pagan Rome and Pagan
[1:02:11] Babylon way back there when Nimrod began
[1:02:13] his kingdom and it moved all the way
[1:02:16] down a river running all the way down
[1:02:18] spiritually a spiritual river all the
[1:02:20] way down through pergamus where a
[1:02:23] duelist had his little kingdom set up as
[1:02:25] he cared in the mysteries from ancient
[1:02:27] Babylon and he then he analysts the
[1:02:30] third will over all those mysteries all
[1:02:33] of those things that he the kingdom that
[1:02:35] he brought back from Babylon he willed
[1:02:38] it over to the Roman Empire because you
[1:02:41] see just like the the spiritual river in
[1:02:45] New Jerusalem wove its way down through
[1:02:47] all of the bride through every every
[1:02:50] fabric of that city every fabric of your
[1:02:53] being this city is woven and
[1:02:56] ran all the way back from spiritual
[1:02:59] Babylon all to the all the way to the
[1:03:01] prison Dave come on my voice and you got
[1:03:05] two hundred thousand demons bound in
[1:03:09] this river that were loosed loose now
[1:03:12] under this trumpet loose now and where
[1:03:15] they loosed loosed under this rule this
[1:03:17] the spirit the the influence of the of
[1:03:20] the Roman system and all of our
[1:03:23] daughters going into every fabric of
[1:03:25] society so that when you go into work
[1:03:27] you see the devil's you see the
[1:03:29] influence that what it's doing is it's
[1:03:31] trying to unite everybody unite all the
[1:03:34] world system into a place we can close
[1:03:37] your church doors we can put you out
[1:03:40] where you can he can bring you to court
[1:03:41] for sayin things that don't match the
[1:03:44] system of the day let me read some
[1:03:50] clothes brother Bob I don't know about
[1:03:53] that let's go to number number 23 where
[1:03:59] brother Brian said the handwriting on
[1:04:00] the wall so Babylon just said in that
[1:04:04] great fertile valley valley there and it
[1:04:07] was surrounded it irrigated by the
[1:04:10] Euphrates River and the Tigris and it
[1:04:14] was a great agricultural center and
[1:04:16] Babylon was a great city and it's
[1:04:19] approximately 120 miles around the city
[1:04:21] 30 miles each side that would make it a
[1:04:24] hundred and twenty miles around they say
[1:04:27] that the streets in the Bible city of
[1:04:28] Babylon was some 200 feet across the
[1:04:31] walls were 80 foot thick and practically
[1:04:33] 200 feet high they could run chariot
[1:04:36] races around these walls with the
[1:04:37] chariots and the gates were made out of
[1:04:39] brass and the goat those gates then will
[1:04:41] be 200 feet across and a ride in the
[1:04:44] center of the city set the palace and
[1:04:47] the palace was the throne sounds like
[1:04:49] they're trying to imitate something and
[1:04:51] through the center of the city came the
[1:04:54] great river euphrates if you'll notice
[1:04:59] it it's the city of the devil for it's
[1:05:02] designed after the City of God as the
[1:05:05] River of Life before the throne
[1:05:08] and in this city they had great swinging
[1:05:11] Gardens off the rossignol and he said
[1:05:18] thought he could build these big walls
[1:05:19] up walk wide enough he could run a
[1:05:21] chariot around them and the great iron
[1:05:23] gates and the things that he built put
[1:05:25] the river right through the middle
[1:05:28] a type of heaven swinging Gardens and
[1:05:31] his throne right by the river like the
[1:05:34] river Euphrates and like the river of
[1:05:37] life in the Garden of Eden and the river
[1:05:39] of life in the kingdom of God and what
[1:05:42] happened it fell because it could not
[1:05:45] stand let's go to the feast of the
[1:05:48] trumpets quote number 25 there is that
[1:05:52] Roman Empire bound there by what the
[1:05:55] ecclesiastical powers which Rome pagan
[1:05:58] Rome became papal Rome and was bound
[1:06:02] there in its traditions of Christian
[1:06:04] what part of Christian listen they were
[1:06:07] bound that pagan influence where before
[1:06:10] it was a pagan army that would run
[1:06:12] through killing everybody and they were
[1:06:14] but there they were bound by the
[1:06:16] Christian ideas by the Christian
[1:06:18] tradition that they couldn't just go out
[1:06:20] there and kill everybody but then here
[1:06:22] under the 6th trumpet
[1:06:23] it was loose to the Jews so what that
[1:06:26] Roman listen to you if you ever watched
[1:06:29] a video of Hitler preaching he preached
[1:06:31] like a Pentecostal preacher because he
[1:06:33] had that anointing of these devils on
[1:06:35] him you see that the things that these
[1:06:38] these Devils unleashed they they began
[1:06:41] to kill and slaughter like how it says
[1:06:43] that the horses breathed fire and
[1:06:46] brimstone and smoke and they took him
[1:06:48] into the furnaces and they killed him
[1:06:50] what was smoking with brimstone with
[1:06:52] fire and they shot him with guns with
[1:06:54] the brimstone and they killed him
[1:06:56] because of the influence of these demons
[1:06:58] of these demons powers that had been
[1:07:00] loosed from that Euphrates River loose
[1:07:04] that were bound all this time and now
[1:07:08] our gonna be loosed on the bride I see
[1:07:11] that's why it's important to know it's
[1:07:14] important to know the tricks of the
[1:07:16] devil it's important to be able to
[1:07:18] recognize how the devil comes against
[1:07:20] you because when the end of
[1:07:22] comes in like a flood which is what he's
[1:07:24] doing now he's coming in like a flood a
[1:07:26] flood of false doctrine a flood of
[1:07:28] everything that he can conceive you man
[1:07:31] can conceive oh and their carnal mind
[1:07:33] you've got to have a way to withstand
[1:07:35] there
[1:07:40] see now I'm having trouble stopping just
[1:07:45] give me a little bit more I'm winding
[1:07:47] down I think before I am I am the face
[1:07:52] of the trumpet quote number 26 he says
[1:07:54] now the ecclesiastical realm has been
[1:07:56] opened from the natural revival of the
[1:07:59] old pagan rope pagan Rome went forth on
[1:08:01] those Jews which has always been their
[1:08:03] enemy the lion with teeth and everything
[1:08:06] has stomped down and broke out the
[1:08:07] people Rome always been God's enemy and
[1:08:10] it was turned loose in the same spirit
[1:08:13] by the dictators of the world because
[1:08:15] the religious system was still holding
[1:08:17] now it's been loosed what is it done in
[1:08:22] the cunningness as he said he come in
[1:08:23] the flatteries and what has he done he's
[1:08:25] bringing the Protestant ecumenical
[1:08:27] council of the world churches the spirit
[1:08:30] of Antichrist upon both of them bringing
[1:08:32] to them to them to the slaughter just
[1:08:35] like they did to the other the other in
[1:08:37] the hour to call the bride how loosed in
[1:08:41] the ecclesiastical church spirit and I'm
[1:08:44] gonna stop on this the musician can go
[1:08:45] ahead and come forward loosed upon work
[1:08:47] not upon the denomination's upon the
[1:08:51] bride but here you'll get it and here's
[1:08:54] really what I'm coming down to here
[1:08:56] you'll get it the bride will not go
[1:08:58] through that time the Bible says not the
[1:09:02] church will but not the bride can't you
[1:09:05] see it any sense ministers can't you see
[1:09:07] that brother and I want to put this
[1:09:09] question to you why will the bride not
[1:09:12] go through that time when all these
[1:09:14] demon powers have been unleashed all of
[1:09:17] this deception all of this false word
[1:09:19] all of these things that are coming
[1:09:21] against the bride why were the bride and
[1:09:24] not go through that time because she's
[1:09:26] been equipped because she's been filled
[1:09:28] with the power like girl the word she's
[1:09:31] been filled with a message birthday
[1:09:33] she's been filled up and she knows how
[1:09:36] to resist that thing she's already been
[1:09:39] sanctified she's already been such a
[1:09:41] justified she's already been filled by
[1:09:44] the power of God and she's been cleansed
[1:09:46] and made spotless by the blood of the
[1:09:48] Lamb so she don't have to go through
[1:09:51] that she does not have to go through
[1:09:54] that thank God for His grace thank God
[1:09:57] for His mercy let's just stand and we'll
[1:10:02] just let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[1:10:05] before I turn the service over I hope
[1:10:10] y'all got something out of that if you

[1:10:17] lift up your hand and we'll just take it
[1:10:20] to the Lord the Lord God I know I was
