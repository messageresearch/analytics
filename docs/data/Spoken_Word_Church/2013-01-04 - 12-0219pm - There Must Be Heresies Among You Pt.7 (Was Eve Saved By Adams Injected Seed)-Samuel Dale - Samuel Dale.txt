some tea and I tried to do everything we really appreciate them they really really kind of got them to go in good and then you know in happiness and working with us amen yeah all right let's pray before we read First Corinthians 11 and first Peter 3. our precious Lord and our savior Our Redeemer are all in all in Jesus is your name we thank you for that name Lord and thank you for your grace and your loving to us and we ask you that you would just bless us now as we read the scriptures and talk a little bit about you and Lord we just pray that you would come on to sing in each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins and guide us and direct us in understanding that we may Lord see you we love you we thank you and we're just come and do as you promised he said you send your word and it would heal us and delivers from destruction so we thank you and we depend upon that have your way now in Jesus name First Corinthians 11. 18 and 19. for first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be also harrises among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you all right first there's first Peter 3 15. recite before I found the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that's asking you a reason or to hope that is in you with meekness and fear amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been covering for some time now a lot of the doctrines and things among the people of the message and as I always say to each one of them as we cover these doctrines I speak only as of to what I have heard to what I know for myself um I've been acquainted with some of the doctrines you know in closeness and listen to them and you know try to check them out see what they're saying and try to see what they're trying to say instead of literally the words sometimes that are being used because you can misunderstand and and not you know get in the correct order and number two then I know and realize that when I announced they were going to speak on this as a doctrine that there's many groups of people that may be related to that doctrinal point but don't agree with the other parts and I was thinking about it there yesterday I think it was and and that's all came to me I was thinking right now you know there are so many doctrines among the people of the message but you know what I thought of little random said it wasn't a hard thing for Martin Luther to protest the Catholic Church see God told him he had done it and that was it said the thing was to hold his head above all the fanaticism that went with it you know and people went out and burned down the Catholic churches and this that and the other under Luther and said that he was telling them to do those things you know and he didn't do it but you know what we do we start trying to argue with anybody about what they believe but just trying to state to our people and to anyone else who wants to listen the things that we don't agree with and I kind of put each one of these on here where there was somebody disconnected on one message then if they want to go back and pick up the others they're welcome to do it if not that's fine but we spoke on two Lords two two Souls Two Lords on River Jordan you know Jesus wouldn't go out to the River Jordan the seventh under virtues that you can't have the virtues that they had to virtue of them to the ages when the Thunders well I don't agree with that because I believe the Thunders of Revelation contained The Prophet said in the Seven Seals and they say one of them was that one Doctrine was that you don't how the Holy Ghost today like it was in the book of Acts and I tried to explain that as to the difference in the upper room experience of the 120th tutor for three and a half years compared with a group downstairs and only heard one sermon and and you know and bringing those things out and trying to show you why uh I don't believe the things and you know and the damaging part that would be to to us all right then we went through their past this past Wednesday uh it was brother Branham the one that came to John on Patmos and uh we tried to cover that as the basis of that was the writing of the word and my concern is is who came to brother random right to bring you and I the message in the end time and all like that and and the doctrines and then this morning we were covering how the is there going to be recovered a two-part thing one was that some people believe that brother random was God you know some would say he's the Lord some would say he's this or that or the other some said he was the son of man and things and we went through that this morning covering it showing why we didn't believe those type of things but when we do believe surely that every born-again believer that has the New Birth that is deity inside of you so laying aside the gifts and the things of the prophet of God then if you have the new birth he had the new birth you're a deity he would be deity because that would be God living in you you know and trying to bring Fame all right now this afternoon we're going to cover another point that has been kind of confusing and the people some have been by here and stated some of the things and we didn't agree with it and uh you know on some of these things and uh so you know I don't try to argue and fuss I try to express and say well I just don't agree with that that's because I can't see it I can't see something it's like I told the man personally that believed in the two Souls I said I can't see what you're talking about I said I'm not saying you're wrong I'm right I'm saying I can't see it and I said you just pray for me you know and I'll pray for you because I just can't see it well I'm just why not be it that way you know it's a whole lot better and say oh yes I believe that didn't go around but I don't really you know no I'd really just you tell me and I don't believe it right right and then maybe we could work on some things of of doing but now what we want to talk about this afternoon is one day has been among the people of the message for quite a while and like I said maybe one or two tried to preach on it a little bit here and we've heard it different places and some of you heard this one on a lot that people believe that Adam injected his seed into Eve to save her now that's a Doctrine among the people of the message and as I said you've heard it's priest here right that's a couple of times and you know I have to say that I just can't see that right and now I'm going to say it this way because like I said there are so many different versions of it till people doing uh well did did Adam have sex with Eve to save her or was it to protect her or was it to preserve her or whatever word would you want to use to be involved you know to see that you could come up and say well my pastor don't believe that it was to save her he believes it was to preserve her okay we just covered that then we just lay that down and you know put it in the right order but now I I just can't follow the thought amen as to where that you could have sex in any form as to be any form of preservatives right or um protection or or anything and uh if you did what would it be so much trouble about serpent seed right you know what would be why why do we need to know about serpent season know what we are and uh it's like Brother Gary Atkins he's not here but he hears it is he alive because he said if if that's all the thing it was it was sex so that's what we had done on 10th Street during Atlanta when you had the hippie movement you know the love movement yeah you know uh you you just you get into the wrong thing amen and instead of trying to make it something you know and look at it that's what it's saying and understand it right you know people get this great Revelation brother Dale you're just not spiritual well if that's what you call spiritual and then I wonder what would be something be wrong you know I mean if it's if it's the fact that I don't believe Adam injected his seed into Eve to save her what would be on what would it be a wrong you know I mean because that's the one thing that got it started in the wrong direction amen right that which you know was that point of what took place so let's just go through that and you just bear with me as I try to speak on these things a little bit and and just put it to my old ignorance and go on and say all right now we know for Surety what happened in the garden amen now we're not dumb enough to not know the situation we know that Eve had relationship with the Beast all right now then she gave to Adam and she had a relationship with Adam and from that came Cain as the lineage of the Beast as being twins with Abel and from Abel you know coming from Adam in the basis of the relationship all right now we've got enough sense to know that took place but that is the the thing but I just can't see how that you know I'll give you a quote in a minute I don't mind giving you the quotes of what these people believe because I don't want you to come along say well well you didn't tell us this that they believe you know what I'll do the best I can to tell you both sides and then you make up your mind as to what you believe right that's I don't see why anybody wouldn't want to do that now when this act took place in the garden why would brother Branham emphasize the fact that Adam had a right to reject Eve all right sure and what would have taken place to Eve have Adam rejected her right she would have been destroyed right now all right we'll get to these in a minute and some quotes from some things but I I'm just the point I want to make to you that you cannot make the the wrong act turned out to be a right thing right amen you know I mean how can you do that you can't say well uh you know people are just ignorant so they don't know and that was no if it's wrong it's wrong and if Adam could have saved Eve by doing that then that would have to mean that some way and that's what people would think see that look at them doing this and all and he injected his seat he took and we've heard it right here and it immediately when the situation took place that Adam grabbed even and knew they had to do something so he grabbed her and and you know had intercourse with her and uh that protected her well if that would be right then where would be the blood of Jesus Christ where would there be any indeed of a savior right you turn it into a sex act right you turn it into a uh this you know some kind of a lineage and then that's the way the people of the message believe it and I've asked for this is one doctor that's in the message that they said if you're born from Adam you could be saved you ever heard that one and it said if you're born from the Beast you could never be saved that was part of the two Souls of doctrines of the issues that came forth well why would God offer salvation decaying right if it wasn't for him right amen now let's don't make God the author of confusion amen amen he offered it right he didn't want to destroy it um Judas he loved him let's let man take care of his own ways of doing things but you see what I believe took care of Eve and we'll read it in a minute it's the same thing that took care of Sarah that's right when she was life in the male Chesney that's right and we don't have no record there of a sex act taking place you know we have a record of one thing God could not destroy Sarah because she was a part of Abraham that's right all right we'll get to that in a minute well I want you to understand that Genetically speaking Sarah was not a part of Abraham that's all right agree but Genetically speaking Eve was a part of everyone the word genetic I guess he called it the room what you call germs you know you've got the education I don't uh Genetically speaking is just a word I use for that see he was actually a part of Adam she came from his body that's right yeah it wasn't just a marital form as a protective all right she literally came from his body right and then in doing that then what would be the thing that would save her you know and also we're going to get down when we get it if we got times we know we'll do it Wednesday we're going to get down to the one of Judah and Tamar that everybody likes you know so well and you can see these preachers until they just you know they they get all excited one night my one brother did here you know I mean he Illustrated that Adam just cookies and you know I mean uh I'm sorry I'm I'm too old I guess maybe I was born under the old school and just don't agree with a lot of things amen but you know what was it that took care of Eve I'm asking you a question laughs what took care of Eve between the times of the act with the Beast and the time with Adam a simple question I think something you know I think the Bible and all the message is very very simple amen and using simple terminology what took care of her minded God not destroy all right because even your Prophet says that sin cannot abide in the presence of God amen all right so let's go to it and just find out something and then we'll maybe bring something in the end it'll be up maybe a tad bit surprising about some of the things forgive me you know no devil he likes to fight but that's all right I'll get me a cough drop and I'll take care of that all right now what was the thing that brother random said was the reason that Eve was not destroyed right right he did not say it was a sex act right he said it was because that Adam loved Eve right all right now let's start on that and just see what we're talking about let's go ahead and message Oneness preached in 1962 to 11. paragraph 30. all right now Adam was a part of our Eve was a part of Adam she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones and that's what the correct Union is and that's what the the correct Union of the church is Spirit of his Spirit word of his word now he was part of Adam all right now if she was part of Adam in the natural will get to it after a while how much more is it of us in the spiritual right all right see she was flesh of his flesh we can read that in the Bible but what I want you to get is what the prophet said that's what the correct Union is the great Union is she was part of him because the new birth is not God coming down in the Holy Spirit to have a sex act with you the planet the sea that's right now that's not the new birth that would be carnality and it would make God having to come down in a literal and have a relationship with Mary to bring forth a child and that wouldn't work out but now here's the one that they love to read on this part so we'll go up to it and read it on page 234 the church a book to talk higher in church age and look now Eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed now that's your word to your Prophet right she should have been burned and you know what if Adam had not taken her and went with her and her sin that's exactly what would have took money right amen yep you should win all that good well all right we know we know the story she's part of him but just remember God told Moses one day he said you just stepped aside and I was just wipe out this whole thing and he said I'll start with you and raise up another generation yep do not ever think that God couldn't do it right that's my point don't think that God couldn't have destroyed Eve if you don't like our city of uh thing but make it a form of word he could love her and it could type Redemption right let's be careful when we get to those points but he could type it all right but Adam intervened watch taking her quickly to himself so that she could be saved Now where's there any point there implication of sex right he took her to himself I mean in other words he embraced he held her took her because he wouldn't take her responsibility we'll read in a minute but he knew what was going to take place once this would happen he knew that she would even bear children right around and says we'll read that in a minute all right but was it a sex act or was it what see she should have been burned but Adam intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she could so she was safe but when this satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene man watch you will be burned with her Seducer for the and her children and the Antichrist and Satan will all find their places in the Lake of Fire right so it will be a finality that will come to where that there'll be a destruction but what took care of it all right look at the next one we'll just give a little reading out of the way 1965 911 God's power to transform transform uh paragraph 83. and he talks about the coming down of what took place no more new hymn Adam knew his wife and she brought Kane and also by our Abel twins Satan was with her that morning Adam that afternoon now the next one really bring up the next one that's exactly what happened came that Satan that morning in the serpent and Adam that afternoon she had two children now seeing in the presence of God one second would mean you're destroyed so you've got a morning and evening I just brought them to worry that somebody come along and say well he grabbed her immediately well what are you going to say now I mean you're going to say there's only a second between the act of the Beast and the act with Adam one second she still didn't lost the whole story because it would still be the same problem right so it was evident live on the morning and an evening affair all right brother random went through and proved you know about the the woman having the black baby and the white baby and one was a lover in the morning one was on up in the day and a doctor said anywhere within a 24-hour period that they would come forth it could be twins from different fathers all right now so get the point of what I'm saying what took care of Eve before Adam took her and done as they want to say he done to save her it could not have been the sector right because it would be a half a day in between them all right you follow me amen just natural things that's why I like to think of things it's natural and just take it out and then let brother Brown just answer the question and let him show you what good place huh see then you wouldn't want to lay up on that because you're just going to that one thing look at the next one go away Jesus 1963. 1103. now God would have took her right there excuse me am I giving the wrong one go wake Jesus 63 1103 226 now God would have took her life excuse me right there but he couldn't hurt her she's part of Abraham and he's not talking about Adam here don't let you I'm gonna talk about Abraham all right we're just getting this point in then we'll go back to Adam and Eve oh we'd be gone long ago if it was a part of Christ all the things that he's done and we went around and said it's telepathy it's this that or the other but he can't touch you see now y'all you study that people is making fun of brother rounds what he's talking about right right and he's saying God can't touch him people why can't God touch them people because of Christ those people were Christians it's not going to be accounted right come on right so what they're saying this to left the other thing but he can't touch you see Ralph can't touch you because you're part of Christ when you're born again see and he couldn't do it but it because it hurt Abraham his promise was to Abraham and Sarah is a part of Abraham and the church is a part of Christ the bride and he couldn't do it old though although her unbelief all right now so God can't touch Sarah because she's part yep of Abraham now not the biggest natural things but remember Abraham and Sarah lived together a long time and you know what I mean but there was no children right you agree all right they were together a long time with no children but surely you know what you're doing they live together okay yeah all right so then the point is is what well I took care of Sarah they went back up to Abraham and he or took care of Sarah was the fact that she was a part of Abraham and that would be then happened Christ in the church divorce 1965 221 in the morning service paragraph 245. why didn't Abraham why didn't God feel so we're sitting there denying and lying right in the face of God sitting there as a mortal man eating flesh eating bread drinking milk and he said why did Sarah life back there in the rough in the back behind him in the tent he had never seen her say this how can these things be she said oh I never said oh my tell God that he's a liar to his face he couldn't take her why she's a part of Abraham amen he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham and you see where you women belong I always pick that up all right but my point is one thing Abraham it wasn't no Act it was the fact that she was part of him right that's it amen exactly right that preserved her yes sir all right because the promise we just read was with Abraham now one of these days when Wade gets through with that I've got a question on marriage and divorce and I let him finish up his part before try to bring any on it but I want us one of these days to just get down and realize who we are where we're at man for man or woman for woman or what we are that's right and see you know what's going on in life and because you see he said they're used to women you see where you're at said you women to be like Sabra was adorned herself in Monster Pearl lived on this and true to her husband loving him so much that she called here him her Lord ruler ownership I don't like the joke that I'll that my wife would say well I call him Lord because my Lord I don't like that that's not a that's not a good uh Point that's making light of the word all right now if that be true that he couldn't hurt you know what about Adam and Eve okay go to number seven Ephesians Church age which is page 104 Church age book he said you actually go to one question it always brings up another now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law but you see it was true in Eden as well as Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change so it would be the same today right Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so we've conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he said the human race sold the human race and to sin that he might have Eve for he loved her that's right amen now love is the point not sex right that's right no I'm not a dummy I know what they did do finally we just read it here all right I mean they did finally have a relationship yet but that's not the point of saving it up amen the point is that he loved her amen all right now what would have happened I asked you a question now this way what would have happened had God destroyed Steve he could have raised up another one sure right right he could give her another to give Adam another right wow right but he didn't do it nope why because Adam stepped in amen which then would top crash not your sex act amen the love that he would have to take her responsibility upon himself right see God saw what it would take to save you and I amen and he accepted that point to die for you and I amen taking our responsibility upon himself amen he didn't you know sin became sin right right we might become the righteousness see but the love that he had amen look at the next one thirsting for Life 1957 6 30 or East 16th Adam forwarded his wife out a perfect type of Christ going with his the bride to take her sins and Adam took the sins of Eve and left the Garden of Eden not deceived but willingly walked out with her so was Christ not deceived Satan could not deceive him all right he came to Earth to die for you and I amen which Adam and Eve would be only the part of it just speaking of it right to where it would come forth all right but what's the point now not an act but a love me I love that Adam would have for his wife all right amen run around we ready to start with and he said that a woman runs out you know right she does something wrong he said she shouldn't be taken back that's right now that's his word you say well I'll take her back and type Christ now be careful I happen to work with a boy that he called his wife about and I'm not joking you know he called her about five times running around and he'd just forgive her and take her back and I just told him one day playing I said you you got more than you probably than I got me I said because maybe acts about three I might have quit right yeah I said that's I believe in forgiveness you know and doing it well it wound up that the old boy would just come over and live in his house while he was at work we were on the night shift you know and he just came over and I said now I just couldn't go that way period you know that wouldn't but my point is what we're going to use this as a twofold form what happened in the garden brother Brown said it was adultery I don't go into that because I know the doctrine is a doctoring in the message you know that fornication is before an adultery after brother Branham called what happened in the garden adultery you need for them need me to bring those to you Eve committed adultery right she had another husband instead of her husband Adam right and the worst off part of it is that she had an animal right not a not a man so that'd be that much worse right come on you don't think like that she had an animal she didn't have a that wasn't a man that was an animal look like a man but it was an animal could be a whole lot more forgiving for a woman having a man with Ronaldo right but you see Adam loved her that's right what I say it because that was the reason I brought the point to you yeah but around said Satan threw the serpent that morning and Adam that afternoon so there was a period of time what took care of Eve during that period of time right because she was a part of Adam right amen and for God to destroy these he would have been destroyed part of Adam and then you would not have had no Redemptive forms to be brought into being agree right then he would have to come down and die in our place amen not to have a relationship with us but the diner place and I've always told you because I found it out on the Jews you know that they believe that that circumcision of the man took care of what happened in the garden that's what you believe what do you know ain't it hard to end the world today they are groups of people maybe not in this message because it really hadn't heard this one tied into the message but I wouldn't say that it wasn't but they have the woman there and she must have sex acts with a preacher to where they can you know save them all right I know there is a lot in this message to where they do have a lot of things that happen but that's their business that's their Doctrine just went to that all right but do you get the point to me now the sex act that happened with Eve was a secondary point right it was not the major thing right the Act was secondary in other words it was a about it was a part of that or an attribute me it wasn't the the setback with Adam she would already destroyed she was through he didn't have the ACT to save her no he loved her right right and he saved her you remember I preached to you what took care of Adam and Eve while it was the point of both of them what took care of both of them from the time that the sin had been committed until God made the sacrifice right right amen remember God made the first sacrifice Adam didn't do it right amen God killed those animals and took the skins and gave them to Adam and Eve well I took care of them before then because Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and God was looking down at that land not looking at Adam and Eve and then when the ACT did take place he stepped down and killed the animals showing that the animal was the Frog the problem my brother when I said the animal was put under the curse all right now see what am I getting at it's the love not an act okay the love that Adam would have for Eve because the Bible said in Adam all died that's right amen saying Eve because he can just wipe her off and start it again but yet God looked down and saw and knew what Adam would do all right and then it would be his love that would spare his Wrath because she was part of him just like it would be with Abraham and Sarah that's right that it would be that Sarah was a part of Abraham right and he would have heard Abraham had he destroyed Sarah yep now I didn't write the book I just like to read it but adultery in the Old Testament and we're going to crack up on this when we get into Judah Tamar but we use it here according to Deuteronomy I got it written down somewhere and y'all get it in a minute that adultery it takes 10 Generations to breathe that out an illegitimate child could not come into the congregation for 10 Generations that's 400 years right right before they could come back into the congregation now that's what God thinks of adultery so look where you would put it if you tried to bring it back there and you'd have to admit that Adam that Eve and the Beast would bring forth adultery but what she done because wrong husband wrong person right taking somebody else instead of her husband right so let's just read this one now remember this we're going to read it again look at number nine this questions and answers book 2 64 8 23 evening 180 subscribe 186. dear brother Brown if a baby is born out of wedlock can this child ever be saved or going to rapture hey what's your I believe the child could be the child can't help what it what's been done that is true but I about going in the rapture save I'd say yes but in the Rapture it's a predestinated seed that goes in the Rapture and I can't believe that adultery was a predestinated seed do you understand read what's your profits right okay now I called up another thing there's people in this message that don't believe that you they believe you couldn't be saved unless you got a certain Landing juice right right if you come in at them you're okay if you come in the Beast you can't be saved all kind of leads using different things but now I can show you if you'd like it I didn't figure this had to be argued or quoted should be enough the ten Generations of the fact of the Old Testament the prophet of God said the blood of Jesus Christ took care of that right all right now a little legitimate child let's take what he's saying at just that point then we'll get back to the other part so that somebody comes along and maybe you're an illegitimate child maybe you know that your your mom and daddy wasn't married or do you want to talk about my righteous in general can you run it back ten Generations can you run it back 400 years I mean any of you on a crow we need to eat some Crow D you're going off on my mama I'm not throwing off on your mama my mother was a mother we've probably all been better off if you'd have took a man after my daddy died unless you made a bad guy you know but listen what if you're an illegitimate child today well if you're sitting there knowing that in your genealogies this one brother was saying something about that one time and I said brother mode I said why is that brother so strong when that he said I don't know either he said but I know there is some possibilities in this lineage maybe he was trying to find somebody that could find an answer to hit me all right go to how many of you could think back 400 years that's right ten Generations because 40 years to a generation right right you think you could capture yourself pure like I told you when they sent us over here on the Mayflower you know I don't think they sent the good people over here I think they got rid of the scum because they were figuring most of them going to get killed so they didn't send to good people all right astonished that's why I say the black people they can run their genealogies back that's why people ain't nothing but a concoction they they call it Caucasian I call it concoction but we don't know where we come from amen amen that's right and who's who but what is the possibility what is it right say that you know that your genealogy was wrong another rabbit said the blood of Jesus Christ takes care of that if you have the new birth amen if you don't have the new birth the Old Testament law still applies that's where people don't believe me on that they think the New Testament well you may win the New Testament but that's all right but you see if you're not born again tonight you're still under the law right man and the ten generation Point still applies but if you're born again the illegitimacy is gone amen right a baby look what the prophet's saying I'm explaining this for what 40 years a baby that's born right now illegitimate you don't think about it going in the Rapture but remember all badges go to heaven anyway babies right go to heaven anyway don't worry about it but if we ain't babies right all right we're old enough to understand right if we don't have the new birth we're all illegitimate from Eve that's what your Prophet said he said he was a hybrid whether you like to hear those words or not run it in your computer he said I'm a hybrid he said every man's born between watching Eve and he said eve and Satan because they're all born from a sex act right then you want to make a sex act a preservative it won't work but you see you get born again today that ends that visited iniquity right amen and he ends that law and I'll state it again where you make sure to understand me if you're not born again you you are still under the law because my Bible says what Christ is the end of the law what for righteousness right over the rest of it what to those that are saved in other words preparation yep you're not saved today you're still under the law right and then you ask people to turn to the first book of the New Testament turn to Matthew Matthew Mark Luke and John the law was still in existence Jesus was under the law he healed people and told him to go make the sacrifice of Moses yep the New Testament begins in the book of Acts amen amen put us into the body of Christ amen listen I don't understand that we'll go back and listen to the text again and said it two or three times but you see Church he said the Rapture is it's a predestinated seed that goes in the rapture if you're born again all right if you're born again there had to be something predestinated somewhere right if you're born again if you're not you don't have to worry about anything you're still under the law no brother damn you don't understand Jesus died I told you what a man said about me one time and I asked him a question and I asked him a blunt question of what he thought about me as a minister and mine you know me when she believed he was way one up this way but I asked him a simple question I said where do you think I stand he said you ain't no more in the badges now I've explained this or some of you know what I mean but most of you don't what was he meaning you're no more than a badges you ever talk to a good Baptist you ever talked to Presbyterian and you asked him said how do you know you're born again what's your answer come on what's the answer they never talk about an experience they say this they say Jesus come on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came and I got it because it come two thousand years ago now does that make you with a new birth nope come on George what are you saying that I could take the Bible and the prophet's message and by my intellect be able to put it together until I would say like run around them I'm not saying the Lord's coming I'm saying he's here right amen and that I was only saying it because he said it right and I wouldn't say it that way and I went back up here to preach to him and when he did he changed his mind because I preached a message on manifestation and he saw the truth all right but listen you just understand what I'm trying to say then I'll get back on the point if you are born again the illegitimate childhood doesn't apply right right because it was ended in Jesus Christ coming and living in you so then you can go into rapture so don't be afraid I can't go into Rapture because I'm an illegitimate child I've told you over and over and I'll tell you one more time I don't care if I could run my DNA all the way you're called to be standing there and calling Daddy you know that new birth that I received in 1969 took care of that if you can't believe it that way you don't have the new birth is the best way to put it you got to believe me on All Odds are all situation draw a thing of life and then don't worry about the illegitimacy but now put it back with a promise the Rapture comes a little legitimate value it's not going in the Rapture right you know a literal literal ill just gentleman baby a baby's not going in the rapture that's what he say it's not going well because it's an adulteress night but I believe and always happily look join Rachel there got two kids coming up to the age of accountability because we don't know what that is that's up to them but the little baby gets here you know I don't believe Jordan Rachel is going to go into Rapture and leave the baby here for somebody else to raise now if you believe that I understand you just blame me call me stupid crazy all you want to I just don't believe it I believe that baby's going with them because it's a baby but it's not illegitimate whatever little sex act that some flame has out here and you say well well I've got kids over there that I had they're illegitimate but they're saved because they're legitimate they're not going to do it all right they might have to come to the New Birth amen and any child no matter what whether your kids were pureborn or what they are they're gonna have to come to the New Birth not because mama and daddy okay is that fine enough everybody understand that if you don't ask me a question about it sometime but what does he say adultery is wrong Amanda So Adam and Eve in the garden now listen Eve had an affair with the Beast that was adultery right Adam took her back that made him part of the adultery right it's not on that husband's wife now now because wow he was not supposed to take her back but he did because he loved her and God honored that not no sex act man he honored that point that Adam loved her and he saw from that exactly what he was going to do right that he was going to come down and die to give his life to take up on him our sin that he could make us his righteousness all right all right bro you following me yes not a sex act but an act of love an act of love had God went in and destroyed Adam he I mean he he would have been destroying part of Adam same thing as it was with Abraham and Sarah right I'll say this about you sisters the weights in there last night in a woman can't be circumcised so in the Old testament's Law she had no rights whatsoever right you got no lineage she's not even counted in the league I'm not now come on listen vote I got a little chance I could read okay the wife of so-and-so with so-and-so you know all right but she has no lineage when Naomi came back to the land she could not type her property back agree right right Boaz had to be the and then she had the other Kinsman and all that had to be settled and took care of boys took the place as a Kinsmen and he didn't live with Naomi no no no no no but he took Ruth but as quick as the baby was born and we're going to get down to a narrow point on this in a minute quick as that baby was born it was taken and given right into the hands come Naomi yep and what was the man's name was all the lights not trying to figure out image is it what uh emilick you know was the one that uh Ruth was married to Naomi was married too in other words the lineage went back when the child was born from Ruth and Boaz that child was counted to the lineage right sure a Naomi's husband so they could redeem the property and that his name not diminished I'm off the Earth Yep all right see that it was made into the right order amen an act of love amen all right now you see what I'm talking about let's read what this one says here so that again right down underneath notice but now in the Old Testament we're still reading from 64 questions and answers but now in the Old Testament when a baby was born a bastard child it could not enter even entered the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations 400 and something years that curse was so bad just think of that an innocent baby it's great great great great great great new name all them great structure great great job just think the baby's great great kenjit great grandchildren could not even come in the congregation of God that's right he said that's strong see adultery had to be cleansed right right amen it can only be done by doing What God Says all right so it wouldn't be an Adam and Eve but I just want to get that point so when we read a few more what do you see what I'm talking about anybody got any points you want to say something about it and he took her sin but Jesus Christ loved you and I and he took our sin right amen no sex act involved a love that he had because he knew that he didn't she was dead right right and you know that's according to the law Mormon family and adultery she's supposed to be stoned that's right right That's the Law right her husband had to be the one to put forth the first stone right now in that him being the one that would be the typing he has to do the first stone you can't Stone them remember she lost one of her pieces of Red Band they didn't take her around and kill her right they waited until her husband came home he catched the first time if you can't see it all kind of Hitler I don't know what in the world you do with it that's why God had the house Mary already engaged to Joseph to protect her I mean with no sex act involved with Joseph and Mary that's right amen but the fact that she was his espoused yep amen she was supposed to have been stoned she was found with child yep so the law would have brought it but Joseph took her but he didn't live with her until the baby was born That's my boy okay so it ain't sex acts you following me that's right just a love right The Binding of a force the prophet called it when to start already a union between man and wife a love of fire amen might sit somewhere last night about it and I know this brother one time he asked me a question he said you've heard me say this he asked me a question he said if you had to give up your children or give up your wife which would you do I said to give up my children I didn't pause I said give up my children right right he said I wouldn't looking for George but I would I said with my wife the time he'd asked me she was still capable I sit with my wife we could have had more children right but do away with my wife you're doing away with part of me right man and I said then I'll stay with my wife right yeah man you know because of the love but are you following me now I'm just going to that point okay what took place was the fact that he loved her not an act of the wrong thing right now let's cover this next while we're at it a lot has been said about Judah and Tamar if you want to go ahead and turn over in the scriptures turn to uh Genesis 38. and a lot has been said and even said here that you know maybe not the literal wording but the implication that God would not destroy Tamar because she had the seed of Judah in her womb and that was the implication and the same ones who make that implication always tie together Adam and Eve and Juden Tamar okay now just remember so we won't have to read it again the last one we read was questions and answers 64. paragraph 186 that adultery is not a predestinated seed okay so remember that now and let's see what happened with Judah and Tamar okay so I'm going to start reading and I found something rarely in here that I really it was in the Bible that I didn't know it was here let's start with verse six Genesis 38 I don't know where have to pull that one up but I just got one I wanted to pull up in a minute okay okay wherever he's back here and Judah took a while for her oh no go back to verse five um better go back to verse three okay all right Judas so there was a daughter of a certain Canaanite verse two whose name was and he took her and went in unto her all right and she conceived and bearishun and he called his name or I guess you said ER number one child okay not him and she conceived again and by her son and she called his name 09 number two okay and yet again conceived in by our son and called his name Shiva three okay and he tells where he was at when she burned and Judah took a while for her his firstborn whose name was Tamar and er judah's firstborn was wicked in the sight of the Lord and the Lord flew it all right 40 children was involved not saying they weren't together as husband and wife but before there was any children God took her out of the way because he was wicked all right verse 8. and Judah said unto oh man go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother remember what we're talking about Ruth and Naomi and the thing because we'll read it right here see if you've done that and you took a wife you know if you had a child you had to give it to the cabara to that woman you know to work when the child would go back to that seat where it wouldn't diminish right you know it wouldn't go off the Earth right in other words it wouldn't be your child right Ruth and Boaz it was their child it was put over Ash to belong in the so and so that the lineage would carry across and keep it going so look what happened so he was wicked verse seven and he died and Judah said unto Onan go in unto thy brother's wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother and Onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went into his brother's wife that he spilled It On The Ground lest that he should give seed to his brother see I knew that was in the Bible what I didn't know it was going to be in this deodorant Tamar until I got to read okay everybody knows that's in there you know about spilling of the seed on the ground but now watch and the thing which he did displeased the Lord wherefore he slew him also number two guys are gone you know all right and then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law remain a widow at my father's house till she left my son be grown for he said let's pray Adventure he died also as his brother did and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house all right so Judah says all right now what you do I'm afraid that an unlaw's two boys I'm afraid I'm gonna lose the other one she'll kind of give a little time you know and go stay in the house when he probably had full intentions and never to let her marry let him marry Tamar right because he didn't do it right he didn't go let her marry Tamar all right but now watch watch that took place and in the process of time the daughter of Schumer judah's wife died and Judah was comforted and went unto his sheep cheers that's Judith wife now in two minutes he and his friend hire him the uh dolomite and it was told hey Marcia and behold thy father-in-law going to go up to timoth you pronounce the words I can't I'm sorry to assure his sheep and she put her Winner's garment off of her and covered her face with a veil and wrapped herself and said in an open place we should by the way dude Gemini first you saw that Sheila was grown number three boy he done grown up and she was not given unto him for wife you're going to read the rest of it Judah went in to Tamar not knowing that that was Tamar he thought it was just an old Harley and she conceived all right remember she asked to sign because he didn't have the the kid with it the goats you know with it so she asked the sign and he gave her the signals sometimes and then she kept it and then she disappears and when it goes on reading when it gets down that finally they go tell Judah that uh Tamar is pregnant he said bring her in you will kill her well when she come up before she got there standing his presence she said just take these in there and give it to him and said this is the guy that's the father or the child that I have right so Judah says that she's more righteous than he is all right now first off to you on the internet system go ahead run around never uses the way we're Tamar it's in the Bible 30 something times but his brother Brown never uses the word Tamar he uses the illustration only one time did he use the illustration about it and he used it in questions and answers on Hebrews number 3 1957 1006. in paragraph 693 through 696 and he explains what happened in this situation you know about the Harlot and the the doings and what he's what she had done but he never emphasized this to read it going to find it we've got it right there if you want it that you know it winds up never saying anything about her being this or that or the other or him being whatever right right all right but you see the emphasis that Brothers put up on using Judah and Tamar that I understand they're saying they're saying that Judah and Tamar was the only way that God could bring the lineage down of Judah all right but I'm sorry you've missed it amen because Judah had another son named Silver law says Sheila I already pronounce it right and he brought four seed to Judah right and it wound up being in the Bible if you want them that his descendants wound up being the uh s-h-e-l-a-m-i-t-e-s all right and you'll find that in numbers 26. not verse 20. First Chronicles 1 18 and First Chronicles 2 21 that it brings down to showing that that Judah did have descendants of his name so his name would not have diminished because he would have carried it on right but I agree with their point of one thing from Judah and Tamar came forth Perez remember how do you pronounce it p-h-a-r-e-z and t-e-h-a-t-e-r-a-h because remember they were twins all right so the point is that what they're saying is that that was the way to get the lineage to come to Dave because David does come from there Solomon comes from there Boaz comes from there but their point was that it was brought down to extend the lineage of Judah to where David could come into being and it is perfectly true that David being coming from the tribe of Judah David being a man after God's Own Heart and I'm quoting scriptures and then in that room at respect and there's no promise that Christ would come from any other tribe he was not promised to come from Levi he was promised to come from the line of Judah which would be the tribe of Judah come on all right but see they're saying that that would be the only way to carry it down but now just remember Judah and Tamar is adultery right anybody would admit that right Judah was supposed to have given his son but when Judah and Tamar had the relationship it was a dog treat right right no she was promised to his son not the Judah come on read your Bible we read it in there Judah said we'll buy it until this boy gets old enough she said the boy's old enough and he ain't Giver Give In to Me that was her husband she had an act with a Judah and they brought an adulterous hat two children fell forth from that sure it extended to lineage but get the point you didn't have to extend the lineage because should I ever apronounce it he was a descended straight from Judah which his lineage went on all right right but did he come to David is the point that David would be the one okay but remember now it's an adulteress Act see then you can't make an adulterous act be a predestinated seed that's right it'll get away from your natural acts of the Old Testament you better get away because what we're fixing the code the William Brothers Jones Pull up The Book of Ruth the Aaron and I were talking about this while ago and I mentioned it to him and then already had it written down to use the scriptures but I want you to look at something and I want you to remember all right we gave the quotes in the prophet if it was an adulteressed act child couldn't come into this Congregation of the righteous for 10 Generations 400 years right he said there was nothing that could take that away you're in the Old Testament you're not coming to the New Testament now get back on the Old Testament with me there was nothing back there that could take it out it had to be bred out right yeah I want you to notice something very accurate on the bottom all right Perez was an illegitimate child remember how you pronounce that name come on that's right okay count with me Perez yeah he had a son by the name of his arm he's only got rain begotten amble of a dead right pronounce it now Sean we got five right hey Sean they got Solomon gentlemen he begotten boys be dry oh bad oh bad we got Jesse and Jesse but got David 10 Generations perfect God bled it out amen it's not the genealogies of carrying it on right that doesn't make any difference it's what God done all right he bled it out to David the word David could be of the line of the tribe of Judah for the Tim generation see it's not sex in the garden it was love in the garden and God promising to fulfill his word that he would raise up a people even in the acts of adultery from Adam and Eve he would raise up with people amen he would come down and make a way and even in his natural way he would count it off from Perez coming from Judah Tamar not because it was in the wound of Tamar no but because he would use it from that and bring it to 10 Generations all right Christ could come from David right amen Christ could come from David now we know he never come from David natural right amen but David was the promise David's son Solomon would sit on his throne which was a type of Christ so it bled out through David the promise of God his word and what was his word in Genesis I'll put enmity between thy seeds and the seed of the woman right I'll put the female woman down that would be Jesus Christ to take away the skin of mankind amen sure Judith Tamar extended the lineage of death of of Judah through their act God turned around and bled it out of him and brought Solomon into existence to be a perfect type of Christ David was a man after God's Own Heart and the Bible says that from not from any lineage of of it's not from the lineage of Levi the scripture says he said but one were and I'm paraphrasing it it is not even mentioned to come from Judah right down through David yes right but not because of sex acts but because of a promise that's right you and I are not dependent I'm not on some sex actor to try to save or to whatever happened in the garden that's right thank you Lord I'm trying to depend on the blood of Jesus Christ that made a way amen and he said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman amen that's good I'll take care of it yeah one of these days I want to preach on Abraham's unconditional Covenant because if it can't be brought out of Genesis over there with Abraham and Adam and Eve then you can't come up with an unconditional Covenant you'll have a garbage can running around because you think Abraham's unconditional Covenant which doesn't matter what Abraham does I'm Gonna Save him anyway wow is that the course where the Prophet said that well if that be true then don't think whatever we do we just live like a devil because we're going to heaven anyway thank you did you see Church an intersection act right it's a promise of God he said what he'd do Judah didn't keep his word but God kept hears amen and he said I'll just bleed that out and I'll bring it down the word that I can bring Christ right from the lineage of David but just don't think now that I'm saying that Boaz and all of them others before I couldn't enter the congregation of the righteous no they did it's just a story of natural typing to where you use it because of Boaz was a type of Christ it's just using it as a story of understanding by staying together like on these things what kind of an Act was it it was an act of love from God that he loved us all right amen right and he made a way amen now let me put one more in there you know that in the Bible that a man that was like that with 10 generations to an illegitimate child right he couldn't come back into the congregation right now he could come out into the kind of the outer Court sector you know he could he could dwell out there he could bring his offerings he could do his things but he couldn't go in for the congregation the righteous that's right but you know what the Bible says about a man just wounded in his Stone do you know the Bible says man's wounded in his Stones he can never come into the congregation nope that's right stones are Revelations right it ain't talking about natural things folks is talking about physical things there because of what it taught come on we can stay a long time on it you know that if a woman and a woman was trying to protect her husband you know somebody beating her husband up and a woman goes in to protect her husband is she grabs the guy in the wrong place they cut her arm off hand off trying it wow it's real straight when you get down to it because of what it meant but you know what I love on the other side that baby ten Generations he can say Daddy Daddy can look downstairs hey go in there I'm still here at home but said you can yep because the illegitimacy ends with me and you can go in Praise the Lord thank you Jesus you know why because you know what the Bible says the Bible says he visits righteousness to a thousand Generations 40 000 years amen that he would make righteousness work we've only been here ten thousand that's they can do you know that's what they say we know it ain't bad right basically I tell you in 12 whatever it is we've only been here seven into that point right a thousand Generations he visits righteousness right so surely our name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and we have that opportunity number one in this Fireball anybody else all power ful don't matter whether we're a legitimate or what God's word is promising oh thank you thank you all of the adulterers ACT ORS oh oh my only in the Darkness another word he went on all power all things are awesome and receive it accept it if it comes apart just pray one for another service coming up Wednesday pray that the Lord we bless us all remember way does he steady him to speak unto us that you the Lord would give him the right words and things to say and where we can all follow their end and then that way we could you know be partakers because that's what I want to be don't you that's right I want to be a partaker if he is divine nature amen I want that all in there and doing that has to come right through the word all right amen Psalm didn't work amen you love me Father we thank you for today thank you for your loving grace unto us well we said we try in order to say what you would give us and forgive us when we don't say it exactly the way you want it maybe Lord and you just come on the scene because it's not what I say anyway it's what you say you just come and speak to the hearts of your people Lord we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you thanking you for your promises that you made and your promises you said are yay and amen but you promised to come and get a little bride that without spotter wrinkle or blemish any such thing then we could stand in your presence not worrying about where we come from and who our mom and daddy was the prophet said it's not what Mom and Dad and he says what you do so now Lord we committed all to you have your way be with the people on the way home bless each and everyone we love you in Jesus name amen that your Disney is over foreign
