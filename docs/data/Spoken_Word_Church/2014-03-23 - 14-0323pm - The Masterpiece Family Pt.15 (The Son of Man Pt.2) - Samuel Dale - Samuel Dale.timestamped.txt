[14:51] to worry about pray paying a price
[14:53] because there's no price we could pay
[14:55] for our Salvation it was already taken
[14:57] care of before we ever came into this
[15:00] world as human beings it was already
[15:02] finished Lord in your mind it was
[15:04] finished before the world we pray that

[15:16] us and just keep us and just have your
[15:19] way with each and every one of us let
[15:20] your love be made manifest in our hearts
[15:23] and our lives in Jesus name
[15:27] amen
[15:30] Matthew
[15:34] 16 verse 13 when Jesus came into the
[15:38] coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his
[15:40] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[15:43] the son of man am they said some say
[15:46] that thou art John the Baptist some
[15:48] Elias others jeremias are one of the
[15:50] prophets he sath unto them but whom say
[15:53] ye that I am and Peter Simon Peter
[15:56] answered and said Thou Art the the
[15:58] Christ the son of the Living God now
[16:00] notice he asks him about son of man but
[16:02] he refers to him as Son of God all right
[16:05] remember he was to be son of man there
[16:08] through the church ages and time after
[16:10] salvation came he's dealing with Son of
[16:13] God so we'll go through that again in a
[16:15] minute so you just you know think about
[16:18] it they he asked them who the son of man
[16:20] was and Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[16:24] all right now watch and Jesus answered
[16:26] and said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[16:28] bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[16:30] revealed it unto thee see if he dealt
[16:33] with flesh and blood he' went back to
[16:34] son of
[16:35] man right and see it didn't do it said
[16:39] but my Father which is in heaven because
[16:41] it was a reason see he couldn't just
[16:43] jump right over to him he had to bring
[16:46] it forth in a dispensation and I say
[16:48] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[16:50] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[16:52] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[16:54] it what a wonderful church and I will
[16:56] give unto thee the keys of the king
[16:58] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou
[17:00] shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in
[17:02] heaven whatsoever Thou shalt loose on
[17:04] Earth shall be loosed in heaven okay
[17:07] let's go over to
[17:09] Luke 17 and I want you to notice
[17:13] sometimes when you're hearing brother
[17:14] brand he gives you Luke
[17:15] 17 and that's the reason I'm using it
[17:18] because he'll say
[17:21] 17:20 just watch it in the message when
[17:23] he's given 17 instead of saying 1730
[17:26] he'll say 1720
[17:29] in a minute maybe he'll correct it and
[17:30] go to 17:30 but he doesn't he just goes
[17:33] on with the scripture we see I love the
[17:34] verse 20 then because look what it says
[17:38] and when he was demanded of the
[17:41] Pharisees because he preached so much
[17:43] about the kingdom of God you know this
[17:46] kingdom of God loen unto so many types
[17:49] and shadows which is the baptism of the
[17:51] Holy Ghost that was to come on the day
[17:53] of Pentecost right now and when he was
[17:57] demanded of the Pharisees these when the
[18:00] kingdom of God should come he answered
[18:03] them and said the kingdom of God cometh
[18:06] not with observation you can't see it
[18:08] it's an inward experience all right
[18:10] neither shall they say low here or low
[18:13] there or behold the kingdom of God is
[18:15] within you now they argued over that
[18:18] through time that was it out here in the
[18:21] field was it here or was it Jesus or was
[18:23] it in Peter was it it wasn't in Peter it
[18:25] wasn't in nobody but Jesus at the time
[18:28] but it would be in in you see all right
[18:31] and he said unto the disciples the days
[18:33] will come when you shall desire to see
[18:36] one of the days of the son of man and
[18:38] you shall not see it and they shall say
[18:41] to you see here or see there go not
[18:44] after them nor follow them see
[18:47] somebody's going to say well he's over
[18:48] here he's over there he's here he's
[18:50] there what for as the lightning that
[18:52] lith out of the one part under Heaven
[18:56] shineth unto the other part under under
[18:58] heaven so shall also the son of man be
[19:01] in his days the future
[19:04] pointing but first must he suffer who
[19:07] son of man who he was di in other words
[19:10] he's saying but first I've got to suffer
[19:12] I've got to die because he can't be a
[19:14] kingdom if I don't die right because
[19:17] I've got everything within me and to
[19:20] give it to you I've got to die to
[19:22] release it all right but first must he
[19:27] suffer many things and be rejected of
[19:29] this
[19:30] generation and as it was in the days of
[19:33] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[19:36] the son of man now look at the day where
[19:38] we're living if you can't place that
[19:40] where we're living to see the way that
[19:43] the world is look at the answer they did
[19:45] eat they drank that fits me and
[19:48] you right they married wives they were
[19:52] given in marriage until the day that the
[19:55] entering into the ark and the Lord came
[19:58] came and destroyed them all and now look
[20:00] at today where we are look at the
[20:02] marriage and divorce situation around
[20:03] the world look how people are going and
[20:07] doing likewise also as it was in the
[20:10] days of lot now what happened in lot
[20:13] sodomite condition right look at the
[20:16] world
[20:17] today so now he's saying this is going
[20:19] to be when the son of man comes into
[20:21] being likewise also as it were in the
[20:24] days of lot they did eat they drank they
[20:26] bought they sold they planted they
[20:28] Building look at the world today all
[20:31] right but the same day that lot went out
[20:34] of Sodom it rained fire and brim strong
[20:36] from heaven and destroyed them even thus
[20:40] shall it be in the day when the son of
[20:43] man is revealed you may be seated the
[20:46] Lord at his Blessing I told you it goes
[20:49] on to talk
[20:52] about the destroying of Jerusalem under
[20:56] Titus and taking place in ad70 all right
[21:00] but it comes into being where in the day
[21:04] when the son of man is revealed or made
[21:08] known okay and this is the hour this was
[21:12] the day down through the time they
[21:14] didn't deal with it the ages they didn't
[21:16] deal with it you know all of them didn't
[21:20] write about it it was in this day in the
[21:23] day when the son of man would be
[21:24] revealed but now he's got to be Son of
[21:27] God
[21:28] because that's what he was he was son of
[21:30] man on the earth he never declared
[21:32] himself publicly saying I'm the Son of
[21:35] God why because it was not the
[21:37] dispensation or time for him to do that
[21:41] he was a man came had to die for our
[21:44] sins but when he released that Holy
[21:46] Ghost out of him then it could come back
[21:48] upon the church all right then you would
[21:51] start another
[21:52] dispensation which would be the seven
[21:54] Church ages and it would be Son of God
[21:58] the holy ghost in the people all right
[22:01] that's why it's called Son of God all
[22:03] right but then he's to come back in the
[22:06] last
[22:07] days and the son of man is to be
[22:10] revealed all right the son of man who is
[22:13] this son of man we'll read in a
[22:16] minute in the beginning was the word
[22:19] according to the scripture in John 1 14
[22:22] it says and the Word was made flesh and
[22:25] dwelt among us all right so that was the
[22:27] Lord Jesus Christ all right I'm looking
[22:30] forward to the day and I believe that
[22:32] the word is being now made flesh you may
[22:35] not agree with that but I don't see why
[22:37] you would it was made flesh in Martin
[22:39] Luther the just shall live by faith was
[22:42] made flesh in the
[22:44] man because that was the word of the
[22:47] hour but not like it's to be here in the
[22:50] end time and it's to come
[22:53] back in the end time in restoration
[22:57] right all right we want to talk about
[23:00] restoration as the word being
[23:03] restored and we know the Holy Ghost was
[23:05] never eaten down it was the word that
[23:07] was eaten down in the ages but the Holy
[23:09] Ghost can only manifest himself
[23:12] according to what amount of word you
[23:15] have is that
[23:16] sensible you know you don't expect
[23:18] somebody to walk in and understand
[23:20] everything that's being said that's
[23:22] never hurt
[23:23] it because that's it's not in there so
[23:26] we have to do it that was why I was
[23:28] covering this morning the great things
[23:30] that your Prophet had to
[23:32] say about this end time but he wasn't
[23:35] just speaking down here where we
[23:38] are you remember I said this morning
[23:41] that he would come in that great prophet
[23:45] and everybody thought that brother
[23:47] brandom
[23:49] right just think about
[23:53] it listen to what he says on the message
[23:55] restoration of the Bride tree
[24:00] 62422 paragraph 506 you know what Martin
[24:04] Luther began to shine a little a
[24:07] light there was a little light just a
[24:10] very small strength of
[24:11] justification Al came Wesley stronger
[24:15] sanctification after Wesley come the
[24:18] stronger than him
[24:20] Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[24:23] Ghost and another great
[24:26] prophet right he says
[24:28] see he said well that was brother random
[24:31] then why does he continue on paragraph
[24:33] 508 he says but in the LI days of
[24:36] Malachi
[24:38] 4 Elijah is to come with the word the
[24:41] word of the Lord come to the prophet
[24:44] amen see so he what's he plainly
[24:47] saying another great prophet came on the
[24:50] day of
[24:51] Pentecost right amen but see no that was
[24:54] just a gift brother
[24:56] Dale well brother Brandon said it was
[25:00] another great prophet well that's up to
[25:02] you look what he says on questions and
[25:04] answers on the seals 63 324 he's talking
[25:08] about see he one of those ages only
[25:10] taking a dip into the Holy Spirit
[25:13] justification is the work of the Holy
[25:14] Spirit sanctification is the work of the
[25:16] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[25:19] spirit that's the reason it took a
[25:22] prophetic Prophet to come
[25:24] down listen to what he's saying right no
[25:28] Messenger to the
[25:30] age cuse the Holy Ghost came himself in
[25:35] his fullness of the
[25:39] baptism but at the end of the age as it
[25:42] always ends upon the others we find
[25:46] there then the messenger sent and all
[25:49] these Scruples and things are to be
[25:50] placed in their place see then the
[25:53] Rapture comes for the
[25:56] church how much PL could the man be but
[25:59] yet we've had people oh them was false
[26:02] well that's their dealing that's their
[26:03] problem that's not
[26:06] me I just believe what he said amen CU
[26:09] you see you'd have to come back to the
[26:10] fullness of the baptism before you could
[26:13] even talk about son of man how could
[26:15] Martin Luther talk about son of man
[26:17] surely he probably preached
[26:19] messages he was a great Theologian style
[26:22] you know and he probably preached things
[26:25] on son of man or something but where did
[26:28] they
[26:31] understand see a lot of people heard son
[26:34] of man but what is it developed
[26:38] into can you go on to see it all right
[26:41] well see we're in the day when the son
[26:43] of man is to be revealed that's right
[26:46] all right right we'll read to you after
[26:48] while brother around said I am not the
[26:50] son of man
[26:52] amen see if you made him the son of man
[26:55] you'd make him
[26:56] God you'd be dealing with
[26:59] deity that would be
[27:01] incorrect all right see because you you
[27:04] got to stay with the word amen all right
[27:07] so we went through this morning talking
[27:09] about in Revelations 1:13 where it
[27:13] says one like unto the son of man in the
[27:16] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[27:19] all right and we went through that like
[27:21] and likeness as it was developing
[27:23] through the scriptures coming through
[27:25] Philippians and thing and coming over to
[27:27] the Book of Revelations we went back to
[27:29] Genesis 1 where it
[27:31] started and he made man in his own
[27:35] likeness not another person not another
[27:37] God that's right amen it's that same God
[27:41] revealed in another
[27:43] form that's why we don't believe in in
[27:46] Father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed
[27:48] Trinity that was never taught until the
[27:50] Catholic Church come along with it and
[27:53] developed it about
[27:54] 606 I tried to start it in 3:25 but it
[27:58] didn't work too good all right but you
[28:00] see we believe in one true and living
[28:03] God
[28:05] am and Jesus was that God in human flesh
[28:08] according to the
[28:09] scripture right he was God changing his
[28:13] form from the great spirit God coming
[28:16] down into flesh all right see then we
[28:19] started off on the day of Pentecost
[28:22] isn't it odd that it started or is it
[28:25] odd it started on the day of
[28:28] Pentecost with the Holy
[28:31] Spirit just like it started up in heaven
[28:34] as the great eternal
[28:37] spirit then he come down and
[28:40] condescended to the son of man well
[28:42] isn't it odd that he started in the
[28:44] church ages as Son of God
[28:48] Spirit right that's same as it was in
[28:51] the beginning it's just a repeat into
[28:53] the church ages bringing it down to the
[28:56] end all right right then we talked about
[28:59] that Luke 17 uh excuse me Genesis 126
[29:03] and
[29:05] 27 as
[29:07] being God
[29:09] himself
[29:11] showing in mankind all right and then
[29:15] winds up in the end time as we're
[29:17] talking about the revelations 113 and
[29:20] looking from there to
[29:23] hear and seeing one like unto the son of
[29:26] man
[29:28] all right same likeness is the one that
[29:31] started it the same
[29:34] God the bride is just God made manifest
[29:37] in another form a husband and wife is a
[29:40] type of that right right why because the
[29:45] wife takes on the husband as being her
[29:50] head right and that they become one amen
[29:56] amen and and in doing that then you can
[29:59] see the beautiful
[30:03] story that in the end time God is
[30:05] showing his bride
[30:08] completed amen right and we see
[30:12] it before we get there yep
[30:16] amen right we don't have to wait to go
[30:19] to heaven to see what heaven is like we
[30:22] read the book of
[30:24] Revelations we hear the prophet's
[30:26] message we don't know what it looks like
[30:29] we don't know what we're going to look
[30:30] like
[30:32] right Bible says we don't know what we
[30:34] look but we we'll be like
[30:37] him we'll have a body like under his own
[30:40] glorious body amen so be beautiful
[30:45] wonderful time I kind of taxed it this
[30:48] morning voice is aggravating okay croak
[30:52] with me all right but think about it
[30:56] now
[30:57] seeing the bride 126 and 27 amen yes sir
[31:03] the very
[31:04] beginning seeing the bride completed
[31:07] right in Revelations
[31:10] 1:13 that's that's that to me is a
[31:13] glorious thing amen where we can show
[31:15] that see and over here you see Genesis
[31:19] you only see it in a singular
[31:22] form right let us make man but remember
[31:27] remember in terminologies when you say
[31:29] man or
[31:30] mankind uh you're not referring to just
[31:33] a gender of a
[31:36] male you know even in you're talking
[31:38] you'll say
[31:40] mankind well that doesn't just mean it
[31:42] ain't no man nothing but man that's
[31:44] right mankind means overall men women
[31:48] everything you know being as one all
[31:51] right then we see him there is one we
[31:55] see him over here in a mini membered
[31:58] body
[32:00] right that's the great
[32:03] revelation of Jesus Christ to be made
[32:07] manifest by you and I before we leave
[32:11] here that's not going to be no different
[32:14] than what the liest is here right that's
[32:16] the problem amen you remember years ago
[32:18] how long's it been I said this one time
[32:22] wait my Lord daddy 1995 19 and 95 okay
[32:26] that's quite a time ago I preached a
[32:29] series called matching
[32:31] pieces and I said the reason we're going
[32:33] to be able to get D is because he's
[32:35] already showed somebody there and when
[32:39] we match here what that is we'll go
[32:42] there that's right but you see our
[32:45] problem is we don't look at ourselves
[32:48] and realize that's what he's looking at
[32:50] we're looking for great things to
[32:53] happen when the greatest thing could
[32:56] happen is to somebody to realize who
[32:58] they are because you know why until
[33:01] Martin Luther realized who he
[33:04] was he had no results he was trying to
[33:09] convert the Catholic church right right
[33:14] he didn't want to leave the church and
[33:15] got his own writings he wanted to reform
[33:18] that's why it's called a
[33:20] Reformation he wanted to change the
[33:22] church and stay in the church
[33:25] right
[33:28] but yet you you understand what I mean
[33:31] he didn't have the great revelation of
[33:32] everything but he had the revelation of
[33:34] what he needed cuz he's going to be part
[33:36] of it all right and so will you and I
[33:39] because that's our day we are just
[33:42] making manifest the ending because the
[33:44] Bible says the end of all things has
[33:46] come upon us right that's amen all right
[33:49] so now if the end of all things is come
[33:51] upon us then the end of the Bible has
[33:52] come upon us for the Gentile
[33:54] dispensation right then it'll go to the
[33:56] Jews and go on down all right but we're
[33:59] looking at what we are now yes and when
[34:02] we match what he
[34:06] saw in Revelations
[34:09] 13 then we're going to go
[34:13] there right and it's like I've tried to
[34:16] tell you for 40 something years isn't it
[34:19] marvelous you got chapter one of
[34:23] Revelations and you can see that he's
[34:25] talking about God and his people then
[34:28] you go to chapter 2 and you start the
[34:29] church ages chapter 3 is the church age
[34:32] coming to
[34:33] Earth then chapter 4 he's going
[34:38] up right he shows
[34:41] us who we are and what we are before we
[34:45] ever leave here
[34:48] am
[34:50] right I mean that's a marvelous thing to
[34:54] me wouldn't it be something to be able
[34:56] to to to have enough money as the
[34:59] prophet said talking about the future
[35:00] home at time you know wouldn't it be
[35:02] something I've kind of got in my mind a
[35:05] little bit what my wife would like
[35:07] wouldn't it be something to have enough
[35:09] money to just not worry about
[35:13] it and now my wife you know she would
[35:16] tell you maybe something but she
[35:17] wouldn't like gold door
[35:23] knobs she would not like silver
[35:26] Chandelier she doesn't like
[35:28] chandeliers if I bought a house for her
[35:31] and had a chandelier and I tell the
[35:32] people I don't like the chandelier put
[35:34] me a big old light up there now she
[35:36] might turn around later and say hey I
[35:37] like the chandelier but you get what I
[35:41] mean her taste is not the fancy things
[35:47] but just put in place whatever is
[35:51] needed and make a place for everything
[35:54] cuz that's what she wants she gets upset
[35:57] when I take my keys out and my things
[35:59] and I lay them on the little dresser
[36:02] thing that's in the bedroom I never I
[36:05] figured out where she wants me to put
[36:06] them I guess back in my pocket but I
[36:08] don't know about that you know but she's
[36:10] always saying you're laying them things
[36:13] there I said they've been there for a
[36:15] week well I know her taste but wouldn't
[36:18] it be something to be able to build a
[36:20] house for your
[36:23] wife of what you could totally afford
[36:30] if we bought a house with that was two
[36:32] story we have to have an
[36:33] elevator she can't walk up down the
[36:36] steps okay there was a time she could
[36:39] run up and down the steps there was a
[36:40] time that she helped me build houses and
[36:43] she cared shingles up on the ladder on
[36:45] her own back of packs of shingles and
[36:48] and let them up on the house where I
[36:49] could put them
[36:50] on but see we're getting older okay but
[36:53] listen you understand my point yes
[36:57] God knows what we
[36:59] want he knows our desires a whole lot
[37:04] more right you know and I'm honest you
[37:08] know we're not rich we got a few dollars
[37:11] you know and we could afford to go out
[37:13] and eat you know and and things that we
[37:16] used to we couldn't afford I mean there
[37:18] was a time we couldn't afford to do I
[37:21] didn't know what a hamburger was till I
[37:22] got married and that's no
[37:25] joke we didn't raise cattle for for uh
[37:29] meat we raised cows for milk I knew what
[37:33] milk was but not what no beef was all
[37:37] right but what about just being able
[37:39] to now it's not even fun to go to
[37:43] Walmart it's
[37:46] not you know I mean my wife should in
[37:50] Walmart she pick up everything in
[37:54] there we were over it uh hamr one day
[37:57] and I talking to this man that's sitting
[37:59] there he said I tell you what or he's
[38:01] telling me this other man that said
[38:03] it he said I hope this place don't get
[38:09] robbed he said cuz my wife's
[38:12] fingerprints is on every item in
[38:16] here well that's the way you women are
[38:19] he like to do all of that stuff Us Men
[38:21] We Don't Give A hoot you know all
[38:24] right but listen amen just get a
[38:29] point to us to realize who we are is
[38:33] what God wants
[38:35] amen and the purpose we're here for yes
[38:38] right we're here the prophet says to
[38:40] prove to the devil yes that we won't
[38:42] fall like Eve did in the garden well you
[38:46] know somebody's going to do that amen
[38:49] somebody's going to fulfill the
[38:50] scriptures well why can't we believe
[38:52] we're just part of it that's all I'm
[38:55] talking to you about
[38:57] but now let's get to the point
[39:00] see this son of
[39:02] man now he walked on the earth years ago
[39:06] and he was God made manifest in human
[39:08] flesh all right but there come a time
[39:11] that he knew he would have to die and
[39:13] give his life and knew that was the
[39:16] purpose he came for all because there
[39:19] would be no way to get his life into you
[39:21] and I without first him making a way
[39:26] amen so he walked as the son of man upon
[39:28] the Earth he said the son of man don't
[39:30] even have a place to lay his ah head
[39:33] what about the God of
[39:35] Glory that to
[39:37] Bar a
[39:39] stable going to be born
[39:43] in First clothes were those swaddling
[39:46] clothes which is the things you put
[39:48] around that yoke of an ox to keep it
[39:50] from wearing the things we've done it
[39:52] many times when we were we were P
[39:54] plowing mules and things the old
[39:57] collar would wear out and brother H
[39:58] shaking his head we'd have to take stuff
[40:00] and pack it in the ho and run around CU
[40:03] if he didn't it would just cut the
[40:04] shoulders of the animals and things you
[40:07] know and they had to borrow that for him
[40:09] to be born be covered with but he done
[40:12] all of that for you and
[40:14] I that you and I could be saved amen
[40:18] amen he had to give his life for us to
[40:20] be able to live
[40:22] right and he couldn't just impart that
[40:24] by coming down and say I'll give it to
[40:26] you no
[40:27] right he had to make a
[40:30] way so that son of man had to die
[40:33] because there's no way to kill God we
[40:36] know that we
[40:38] understand so he didn't die as Son of
[40:40] God he didn't die as son of
[40:43] David he died as son of
[40:45] man and he released that
[40:48] life that he
[40:50] was a son of man to where he could be my
[40:54] brother my kin
[40:56] man My Savior My Healer all the things
[41:00] and he would be the son of
[41:02] man all right then when he was here in
[41:05] this life as I was quoting and I've been
[41:07] a
[41:09] lot he didn't call
[41:12] himself the unveiling of God paragraph
[41:15] 65 he could not call calling himself the
[41:18] Son of
[41:21] God because it wasn't that
[41:25] dispensation it wasn't that
[41:28] time he was the son of man prophesying
[41:32] to fulfill and reveal to them all the
[41:35] things that had been done and typed what
[41:40] he was he tyed all the way through the
[41:41] old test right all right so think about
[41:46] it
[41:47] now look what he goes on to say on the
[41:49] unveiling of God paragraph 68 he came
[41:52] first as the prophet and they crucified
[41:55] him his own crucified him he came as the
[41:59] son of man then after the Holy Spirit
[42:01] came he was then the Son of God God is a
[42:04] spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God
[42:08] he lived through the church ages as Son
[42:09] of God now in the Millennium he be son
[42:12] of David sitting upon the throne of his
[42:15] father you remember the promise to
[42:17] David promis to David that his son would
[42:20] sit on his Al on his throne he did
[42:22] Solomon sat on the throne right all but
[42:26] that was just speaking of the
[42:28] one that would sit on the throne see all
[42:31] right so if he's son of David he's going
[42:33] to be king of the
[42:35] earth that's the millennial right he'll
[42:37] be king of the earth and we'll Rule and
[42:39] reign with him according to the
[42:41] scripture all right but watch what he
[42:44] says and remember between the Son of God
[42:47] and the L you see in church age they put
[42:50] him
[42:51] out now whether you believe it or not
[42:53] but God has been put out of the church
[42:55] amen yeah now listen to the
[42:57] explanation they want him there as a
[43:01] Healer he's not put out like we say the
[43:03] word put out cast out they want him as a
[43:08] Healer they want him as a
[43:11] savior but they don't want him to be God
[43:14] of their
[43:17] life Israel wanted Jesus Christ when he
[43:20] first went out read your Bible right he
[43:23] was very popular because he could heal
[43:26] sick he could raise the dead he could
[43:28] feed 5,000 with just a little bit of
[43:30] boy's food you know man wouldn't it be
[43:32] great today to have a guy like that in
[43:34] the
[43:34] economy we wouldn't have to worry about
[43:39] Obama but think about
[43:41] it but he changed his
[43:44] form see between the Son of God words in
[43:48] the Leo and age they put him out and
[43:50] then Luke he said he would be revealed
[43:52] again as son of man the prophet for
[43:56] fulfilling the rest of it see the
[43:58] scriptures tie perfectly together son of
[44:02] man Son of God Son of
[44:04] David what was it it's the same God all
[44:08] the time just changing his form in
[44:11] morphe he just changes it's a great
[44:14] drama he is acting it
[44:17] out but see when you read and you we'll
[44:20] read you know like in the last days
[44:23] fulfilling the the son of the prophet
[44:26] fulfilling the rest of it everybody
[44:27] locks on brother
[44:30] brandom they just stop and they've made
[44:32] him God they've made him deity they've
[44:35] made him
[44:37] everything and and and I'm I'm I I don't
[44:40] believe that there's only one true and
[44:41] living
[44:43] God he was not the son of
[44:46] man the son of man is the Lord Jesus
[44:51] Christ if you make him this son of man
[44:53] you've made him deity come on
[44:57] on now we believe what he T cuz that's
[45:00] what we
[45:02] believe thank God for
[45:05] it but yet we don't make him
[45:09] God we make him a human
[45:11] being that God was
[45:14] using all right so then think about what
[45:17] he's
[45:18] saying the same God all the time just
[45:22] changing his form that's the same God
[45:25] then when you was talking to this
[45:26] Prophet here he's not talking about just
[45:32] the prophet Malachi for or whatever he
[45:36] was the
[45:38] prophet he was the god of the
[45:40] prophets when you
[45:42] say Jeremiah prophesy son of
[45:47] man the man's lips
[45:50] moved but to God spoke through his lips
[45:54] right to the mankind
[45:56] amen
[45:57] right it wasn't God standing there God
[46:01] was using the man to speak but the man
[46:04] wasn't
[46:06] God it was a human
[46:08] flesh so is it with brother random
[46:11] that's where we have to we keep it in
[46:12] the right order but look what he says
[46:15] now on God's provided place of worship
[46:18] 65 425 paragraph
[46:24] 195 look what he says
[46:26] now Jesus himself at the day when the
[46:29] son of man is being revealed in other
[46:30] words the son of man the ministry of
[46:33] Jesus Christ
[46:35] himself
[46:36] okay now in the last days a man came
[46:41] with the ministry of Jesus Christ we
[46:44] believe that all
[46:46] right but that didn't make the man Jesus
[46:50] Christ now watch the church will come
[46:52] through justification through Luther
[46:55] through sanctification ation through
[46:56] Wesley through the baptism of the Holy
[46:59] Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right
[47:02] on into the Perfection of the son of
[47:06] man now he says the church
[47:11] will that when husband and wife will be
[47:14] the same self
[47:17] persons husband and wife becoming one
[47:20] Christ and church becoming one right God
[47:23] will be so manifested into his
[47:26] bride his church till they will both be
[47:30] the same there are one and you see where
[47:34] we
[47:35] at you can't
[47:39] separate God from his
[47:42] people because that's where it's
[47:44] at he's living in his people all right
[47:48] you see what he's talking about God will
[47:50] manifest
[47:52] himself into his bride
[47:57] I preached this in 1969 in Athens
[47:59] Georgia and I done then just what I'm
[48:01] saying and doing now I keep coming back
[48:04] say wait just a minute people's mind is
[48:07] locked on son of man William brandham
[48:11] William Brandon was not the son of man
[48:14] that's right now label me whatever you
[48:16] want
[48:18] to but he was not the son of man he said
[48:21] he was we'll read it in a
[48:24] minute
[48:26] but he said the
[48:28] bride would be the son of
[48:33] man brother Brown is part of the
[48:37] Bride now when we finish this part I
[48:41] will ask for a raise of hands you
[48:43] remember this morning you believe you're
[48:45] born again I believe that amen believe
[48:48] you saved I believe that believe you got
[48:49] the Holy Ghost I believe that you
[48:51] believe that the fullness of the godhead
[48:52] bodies in right your hand goes
[48:54] down you don't want to go that far but
[48:57] that's what he said
[49:02] amen
[49:04] well who are us to deny What God Says
[49:07] About
[49:09] Us
[49:10] right yeah we think of a Perfection we
[49:13] think of a
[49:15] something and when I do I think of the
[49:17] Jehovah the Old Testament busied himself
[49:20] with the children of
[49:22] Israel and they were nothing but garbage
[49:25] cans
[49:26] that's
[49:27] right David had one of his mighty
[49:32] men life taken from
[49:36] him to get his
[49:38] wife
[49:41] right but yet the Bible said he's a man
[49:43] after my own
[49:45] heart you mean God is a murderer
[49:48] no that was
[49:52] David on his home way home from
[49:57] basba that was the woman he
[49:59] took he cries out and he said Lord
[50:02] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[50:05] amen that he knew he didn't have none
[50:08] but he had an honest and a contrite
[50:10] heart
[50:11] right and out of all that Israel was
[50:14] doing till even balam would try to show
[50:18] and say look in the Bible says the
[50:20] hinder Parts what does it
[50:24] mean
[50:26] the hinder Parts is the most vulgar
[50:29] things you could see and he was trying
[50:31] to show him what Israel was
[50:33] doing running around with the moabites
[50:36] right every kind of thing even having a
[50:38] meeting one
[50:42] day and Moses was telling them to get
[50:45] rid of the moabites a guy goes by
[50:48] Leading the
[50:50] moabit right to his
[50:53] tent while he's telling them to get rid
[50:56] of
[50:58] him you know what a guy
[51:00] done he just took him a
[51:03] spear and he just walked behind him
[51:06] and killed them both y
[51:11] right God says thank
[51:14] you for doing
[51:17] that right but you see we look at it as
[51:21] my point is we look at it we've got to
[51:23] be to a certain thing
[51:26] the certain thing we got to be at is to
[51:28] not reject God's word right that's
[51:32] it no leaven you remember no leaven
[51:35] among her brings the fullness of the
[51:37] godhead bodily into the bride you
[51:39] remember that quote
[51:41] right what is leav denominational
[51:47] doctrines you know that God don't see
[51:49] our little silly sissified ways thank
[51:53] God he
[51:54] don't if he did he'd have to kill every
[51:56] one of us come
[52:00] on but he can't come over that atonement
[52:02] that he
[52:06] made brother rham when bam was trying to
[52:08] show that to to him there you know and B
[52:11] and all that to hinder Parts the worst
[52:13] thing he said he just didn't see the
[52:16] shout of the king in the
[52:21] camp God comes down every day and
[52:23] fellowships with you and I in our
[52:25] garbage can
[52:27] conditions oh but brother Dale don't
[52:29] tell me I'm a no you're double garbage
[52:31] can when you think you're not a garbage
[52:33] can is that the best way to say
[52:36] it it's just as garbage can to be human
[52:39] but when we think we're so righteous and
[52:44] holy you know that God can't save
[52:46] somebody that's righteous and
[52:49] holy come
[52:51] on is when you admit that and try to get
[52:54] rid of it and save you all right get off
[52:57] and go on brother Dale I'll try to but
[53:00] do you see what I'm talking
[53:03] about the Bride of Jesus
[53:08] Christ is to manifest in the last days
[53:12] the son of man look at what he says on
[53:14] the next
[53:15] message which is a trial number
[53:18] nine 64 427 paragraph
[53:23] 267 Jesus Christ is yesterday today and
[53:26] forever and he's identifying himself as
[53:29] he
[53:31] promised much more could we say in these
[53:34] last
[53:36] days as son of man making himself known
[53:40] among his
[53:44] people well well that's brother Brown
[53:46] made manifest among the people now read
[53:48] the rest of the
[53:51] sentence among his people in the form of
[53:56] his
[53:58] people all right see not Son of God not
[54:02] son of David but son of man Son of God
[54:05] was a
[54:07] supernatural think about
[54:10] it look at the next one unveiling of
[54:16] God 3:14 through
[54:19] 3:15 think about these things
[54:23] now paragraph 314
[54:25] 3:15 but God is still there to make that
[54:28] that just the sign notice what does it
[54:31] do it finally returns back to the
[54:34] original seed again you remember that
[54:37] son of man died went into the ground son
[54:39] of man comes back okay you remember all
[54:42] we went through the seat when he come in
[54:44] the form of Martin
[54:45] Luther when he come in the form of John
[54:48] Wesley when he come in the form of the
[54:51] Pentecostals he is supposed to reveal we
[54:54] say these are right right we believe
[54:56] that he come back there but do we
[54:58] believe this he is supposed to reveal
[55:01] himself again like the same seed went in
[55:06] the son of man he revealed himself as
[55:08] Son of God through the stock age and so
[55:10] forth but in this last age he's to
[55:12] reveal himself as son of man again get
[55:15] it congregation says amen all right like
[55:20] the beginning molded and what does that
[55:23] stalk what does that stalk
[55:26] grow it's growing all the time that
[55:30] little stalk grows still it's not like
[55:33] the original grain you know when you
[55:34] plant corn your shoots come up got a
[55:37] feel of corn but what are you looking at
[55:40] you got a couple of stalks you've not
[55:41] got nothing you can eat cows might can
[55:44] but you can't what does that stock grow
[55:47] it's growing all the time that little
[55:49] grow still it's not like the original
[55:51] grain never was Luther's message no
[55:56] Along come the other messages finish
[55:58] sanki KNX Calvin on down none of them
[56:02] there were still the message but they
[56:04] were still the message but what it was
[56:08] they didn't get the complete revelation
[56:10] of it cuz it wasn't time you can't put
[56:14] the ear on the corn before it's time to
[56:18] come and then finally there comes back
[56:22] again the original seed that went into
[56:25] the ground all right see what he think
[56:29] of him what he
[56:30] saying look at this one this is
[56:32] unveiling of God paragraph 318 through
[56:36] 320 but I want you to think about these
[56:38] things now to the perfect after the
[56:41] stalk has been formed after the tassel
[56:43] has been formed after the grain has come
[56:45] into the cob then has to come to
[56:48] Perfection back to a regular grain again
[56:50] brother Ray gave me something the other
[56:51] day about you know that ever I'm not
[56:54] talking about deformed I'm talking about
[56:56] regular corn okay
[56:58] every corn ears got the same amount of
[57:05] kernels rings and
[57:08] that you know it's amazing how things
[57:12] are so beautiful but look grain is
[57:15] coming to the cob and it has to come to
[57:17] Perfection back to a regular grain again
[57:21] and remember the grain must be gerti if
[57:23] it don't it won't live
[57:25] see none of us out none of that outside
[57:28] of them messages will ever come to life
[57:31] it has to be gered to it but remember
[57:33] the same life that was in the stalk is
[57:35] in the
[57:36] grain but it's just maturing itself
[57:39] right back see he revealed himself what
[57:42] son of man the grain that went into the
[57:45] ground to get the message what went into
[57:48] the ground son of man do you get the
[57:53] message he said
[57:57] all where lost it come that's original
[58:00] grain now what did he revealed himself
[58:03] next in a different form stalk and T and
[58:05] so forth and all of these everything he
[58:08] revealed himself then what Same Spirit
[58:10] but in a different form see but what's
[58:12] the L of that corn it comes back to the
[58:15] original grain is that right and his
[58:17] ministry comes from them reformations
[58:21] back to the original word again the word
[58:24] comes to a prophet and he promised it in
[58:27] Malachi
[58:28] 4 and to restore the faith of the people
[58:32] back to the original grain what went in
[58:35] the ground is here the same now you
[58:39] argue with him the grain is come up
[58:41] through here it come up as Son of God
[58:45] that reveals itself here as son of man
[58:48] and then it revealed itself as son of
[58:50] David on the throne see them three sons
[58:53] just exactly the original grain all
[58:57] right now who is this son of
[59:01] man all right who is this son of
[59:08] man all right let's read and see who it
[59:12] is go ahead
[59:14] with it's the rising of the sun
[59:17] paragraph 93 Now who is the son of
[59:23] man he tells you who it is in the
[59:26] beginning was the word and the Word was
[59:29] with God and the Word was God and the
[59:31] Word was made flesh and
[59:33] dwell he said and the Son of God is
[59:35] alive again with the baptism of the Holy
[59:37] Ghost right among us and that's giving
[59:41] life think about it who is this son of
[59:44] man go ahead with
[59:50] 12a proving his
[59:53] word I'll give these later again but
[59:55] proving his
[59:57] word 1964 816 paragraph
[1:00:01] 222 and the son of man is revealing
[1:00:04] himself in the same power that he was
[1:00:06] not down to the church age through
[1:00:09] justification sanctification all these
[1:00:11] things here but the son of man who is
[1:00:14] the son of
[1:00:15] man the
[1:00:18] word who are we talking about the
[1:00:21] word the word is what's sharper than the
[1:00:23] two-edged
[1:00:25] right go on the anointed ones at the end
[1:00:27] time paragraph
[1:00:31] 269 I handed these into them extra
[1:00:35] so all right and look what he
[1:00:39] says it isn't me it wasn't the seventh
[1:00:42] angel oh no it was the manifestation of
[1:00:46] the son of man it wasn't the angel his
[1:00:50] message it was a mystery that God
[1:00:53] unfolded it's not a man is God the angel
[1:00:57] was not the son of
[1:00:59] man he was a messenger from the son of
[1:01:02] man the son of man is Christ he is the
[1:01:06] one that you're feeding on you're not
[1:01:08] feeding on a
[1:01:11] man his words will
[1:01:14] fail but you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:01:17] body word of the son of man who is this
[1:01:21] son of man in the beginning was the word
[1:01:27] the word was made
[1:01:29] flesh I thought that was what we claim
[1:01:32] to believe amen go on to 13 let me try
[1:01:36] to get some of this reading done all
[1:01:38] right this is taken from the trial
[1:01:40] paragraph
[1:01:42] 164 now what did he promise to be what
[1:01:46] what did he promise to a vindicate
[1:01:49] himself in a man a human flesh like he
[1:01:53] did to Abraham when the son of
[1:01:55] man it would be the son of man not not
[1:01:59] not not the Son of God
[1:02:02] now all
[1:02:04] right here stands brother
[1:02:06] random and God is using the man that's
[1:02:10] right to speak
[1:02:13] outwardly if it's the word that's being
[1:02:17] spoken then the word is the son of man
[1:02:19] that's right that's right if it's the
[1:02:22] word today being spoken the word is the
[1:02:24] son of man that's
[1:02:25] right right that's right that's that's
[1:02:29] not you know and he can use anybody to
[1:02:33] speak that's
[1:02:34] right he used a donkey to correct a
[1:02:37] prophet that's right right he used a
[1:02:41] rooster to Crow to correct Peter or
[1:02:45] remind him of what went
[1:02:48] wrong it's not the
[1:02:51] person it's the god that you're talking
[1:02:54] about not not the Son of God now the Son
[1:02:57] of God in a son of man did you read
[1:03:01] it the Son of God in a son of man in
[1:03:05] Ezekiel the first chapter second verse
[1:03:07] Jehovah called Ezekiel the son of man
[1:03:10] exactly what Jesus called
[1:03:12] himself you understand that through the
[1:03:14] teaching of the weak now we see what is
[1:03:16] the son of man prophetic what was Miki
[1:03:19] for to be a
[1:03:20] prophet what were was these things to
[1:03:24] happen in the last days now he never
[1:03:27] said when he said they would
[1:03:30] happen and they did now you if he is
[1:03:34] still the Son of God the son of man
[1:03:38] ready to be revealed in the last days on
[1:03:41] the throne of David as the son of David
[1:03:44] see watch then he if that's not ready if
[1:03:47] if that's right he promised that he's
[1:03:50] obligated to his word he's obligated to
[1:03:54] to that word so whatever he says is
[1:03:57] going to be is going to be that's right
[1:04:01] we should have at least realize that
[1:04:02] much whatever go to the
[1:04:10] next this
[1:04:12] is taken from the Mighty God unveiled
[1:04:16] before
[1:04:17] us and he's explaining Jesus Moses
[1:04:20] coming Moses Veil now Moses what was it
[1:04:24] was the Living Word to the
[1:04:27] people do you have any problems with
[1:04:29] that
[1:04:31] no Moses was the Living Word right it
[1:04:36] was coming through
[1:04:38] him I didn't make him anything that's
[1:04:42] right it was the god using the
[1:04:45] man but God looks at him and says you're
[1:04:48] the word to the people he said Moses
[1:04:50] Moses says wait a minute I can't go got
[1:04:53] this speech ined
[1:04:55] problem is it okay Moses he I'll show
[1:04:58] you what I'll do now read your Bible if
[1:05:00] you don't we'll get in it and read it he
[1:05:02] said Moses you're going to be God to the
[1:05:06] people he said I can't talk he said okay
[1:05:10] I'll just make Aaron your Prophet that's
[1:05:12] what the Bible says that's right Moses
[1:05:15] would stand down there probably look
[1:05:17] around he said and I'm not joking or
[1:05:19] making fun he Aon tell
[1:05:22] them go some form of a problem with
[1:05:25] speech Aaron turned around and said
[1:05:28] flies fleas frogs that's
[1:05:33] right brother around him was the voice
[1:05:37] he said I'm just the one he
[1:05:40] uses that's the same as all of us that's
[1:05:43] right does it make you anything to think
[1:05:47] that you're a child of
[1:05:49] God that's the greatest thing that could
[1:05:51] make you but I mean does it make you

[1:12:55] he said it was the same as Revelations
[1:12:59] 1:13 amen which is bride form right
[1:13:04] Revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get
[1:13:06] home the seven angels message opening up
[1:13:09] the seals what is it not the angel is
[1:13:13] the son of man
[1:13:14] right but the messenger is revealing the
[1:13:17] son of man can you get it separated now
[1:13:21] that's where it seems to be so hard for
[1:13:23] you
[1:13:26] and I
[1:13:29] understand I mean if you walked with
[1:13:31] that man just the people I've talked to
[1:13:35] personally that had personal
[1:13:37] experiences if you walked with a man I
[1:13:40] mean every day you walked with him and
[1:13:42] you talked with him and he look at you
[1:13:44] and he' just tell you what's going what
[1:13:46] happened something what it is or what it
[1:13:49] is what you
[1:13:50] know I mean You' get to looking at him
[1:13:52] as God
[1:13:54] I'm not throwing no slangs at a Catholic
[1:13:56] church but there's a guy ain't even got
[1:13:58] no signs or whatsoever and they call him
[1:14:00] God right well here's a man that could
[1:14:04] stand there and tell you your whole
[1:14:07] life there was a time that they had some
[1:14:09] Indians that they couldn't
[1:14:11] prove because they were trying to get
[1:14:13] them set up on the government you know
[1:14:15] to to do and none of them knew when
[1:14:17] their birthday
[1:14:20] was CU it didn't Mount nothing to them
[1:14:24] but when they come down to start trying
[1:14:25] to draw from the government they
[1:14:26] required that they know their birthday
[1:14:29] they told brother brandom now this is
[1:14:30] the story
[1:14:33] related he said bring them in they
[1:14:36] brought them in he went right down the
[1:14:37] line told every one of them when their
[1:14:41] birthday was it's I just
[1:14:44] guessed they got their monies that's all
[1:14:47] right do what you want to guessing or
[1:14:50] whatever you want to call it that's
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:58] right remember the story about the time
[1:15:00] that he was there I know brother M them
[1:15:02] told us about it but it was during while
[1:15:04] they was there not to them but he was in
[1:15:07] a discernment line and he called out
[1:15:09] this person and he said you you live it
[1:15:11] so and so and so and
[1:15:15] so boy out the service is over they come
[1:15:17] running around that he's
[1:15:20] wrong we know that man
[1:15:24] the man was standing there he said what
[1:15:27] said you don't live there he said I just
[1:15:30] moved
[1:15:33] there you
[1:15:35] see if we saw that every
[1:15:39] day I've had trouble here and I had to
[1:15:42] publicly denounce it that some of you
[1:15:45] have said I was a prophet and I publicly
[1:15:48] from here denounced
[1:15:50] it twice I've done it
[1:15:55] why because just the little things of of
[1:15:57] the
[1:15:58] ministry get that Ministry out get that
[1:16:01] person off your mind get the ministry on
[1:16:03] your
[1:16:04] mind thank God for what he's used this
[1:16:07] old
[1:16:08] dumb Georgia a bunch of clay to
[1:16:11] use but it don't make me nothing I'm a
[1:16:16] servant most people you tell them that
[1:16:19] the church thinks they're Prophet you
[1:16:21] can't get their head through that door
[1:16:22] it's a big
[1:16:27] right this is not set on a
[1:16:31] man we're not building brother around
[1:16:33] him up god build him up
[1:16:37] sir he proved who he was look what he
[1:16:40] says the S Angels message opening of the
[1:16:44] seals what is it not the angel is the
[1:16:47] son of man the messenger is revealing
[1:16:50] the son of man can you get it separated
[1:16:52] now that's where it seems to be so hard
[1:16:55] for you you see not the son of man
[1:16:58] himself but the seventh angel the
[1:17:01] seventh messenger is revealing to the
[1:17:04] public the son of man because it's left
[1:17:08] the shook it can't organize it it's the
[1:17:12] grain itself again one more and we'll
[1:17:21] quit this is questions and answers
[1:17:25] 1964 paragraph
[1:17:27] 291 let's see one minut yeah okay we got
[1:17:30] it and well we got a 101 up there for
[1:17:33] some reason but that's the have two in
[1:17:35] here it's up right way it goes but it's
[1:17:36] paragraph all some say brother brandham
[1:17:40] is the son of
[1:17:41] man now this was a
[1:17:43] question I thought the pillar of fire
[1:17:46] was the son of man am I mistaken well
[1:17:49] that's a good question very good but I
[1:17:52] am not not the son of man but a son of
[1:17:56] man there's quite a difference Jesus
[1:17:59] Christ was the son of man the Son of God
[1:18:02] the son of man the son of David now if
[1:18:06] that ain't enough for us to get it
[1:18:08] settled of his own words of what he said
[1:18:12] then you can't settle it anyway and
[1:18:14] quotes I ain't going to convert nobody I
[1:18:15] told you that we started while ago
[1:18:18] people are still going to believe but
[1:18:20] look what he goes on to
[1:18:21] say I am not the anointed son of
[1:18:28] man he
[1:18:30] wasn't watch him about the word
[1:18:35] Prophet now I want you to think about it
[1:18:38] and then you think i' I degrade him I
[1:18:40] want to show you how great that we put
[1:18:43] him and God puts
[1:18:45] him now I wish we could hold off and
[1:18:48] maybe you don't read the bottom of
[1:18:50] that how many times have you ever heard
[1:18:52] brother around say
[1:18:53] say I'm a prophet you know you believe
[1:18:56] me to be a prophet he said now the
[1:18:59] prophet means this new testament
[1:19:01] preacher is the word Prophet have you
[1:19:04] ever read the rest of
[1:19:07] it look what he
[1:19:09] says because you want to give it in
[1:19:11] terms a prophet in the English term is
[1:19:14] merely a preacher anybody knows that get
[1:19:18] the dictionary see a prophet is a
[1:19:20] preacher under the English dictionary
[1:19:24] but under the Hebrew are the
[1:19:27] Greek a prophet is a
[1:19:33] sear one who foresees things and
[1:19:37] foretells things but under the English
[1:19:41] interpretation a prophet is a Seer now
[1:19:44] you know what he's saying go under the
[1:19:47] English a prophet is a preacher
[1:19:50] right under the Hebrew and in the Greek
[1:19:53] a prophet is a
[1:19:55] Seer a lot of difference between being a
[1:19:58] preacher and a prophet that's why I've
[1:20:01] denounced to here I am not a prophet I
[1:20:03] don't have the ministry of a prophet if
[1:20:06] I don't have the ministry of a
[1:20:08] prophet why am I going to try to sell
[1:20:10] everybody what I
[1:20:12] got you said well the word comes to the
[1:20:14] prophet quote Church a book the word
[1:20:17] comes and spirit fail
[1:20:20] right that's right amen
[1:20:23] don't you believe the word Came To You
[1:20:25] by way of brother
[1:20:28] Brandon
[1:20:30] right but he said I'm not the anointed
[1:20:33] son of
[1:20:35] man he said Jesus is son of man Son of
[1:20:38] God Son of David now if brother Brandon
[1:20:41] was son of man you'd have to read that
[1:20:43] this way Jesus was Son of God and Son of
[1:20:46] David brother randam was son of
[1:20:51] man we make light of the Catholic
[1:20:55] church I don't say I do but I most
[1:20:58] people make light of the Catholic Church
[1:21:01] they're saying they got a
[1:21:05] pope that is in God's
[1:21:08] stad and really he's not saying that he
[1:21:10] says he's instead of God but you make Li
[1:21:13] of
[1:21:15] that but
[1:21:17] probably at least 50% of the people
[1:21:20] following this message as elevated
[1:21:23] brother brandom into the position that
[1:21:25] they make him greater than even the
[1:21:31] pope elevates
[1:21:33] himself you see why I'm against all
[1:21:37] that I'm not against the pope he's a
[1:21:39] fine
[1:21:42] guy I no problems with
[1:21:46] him he can be what he wants to you can
[1:21:48] play what you want
[1:21:50] to you're a free moral agent that's
[1:21:53] right right but it's what I've got to
[1:21:56] believe that's what I preach the god I
[1:22:00] see that I've seen all my life to see
[1:22:03] him I want to follow
[1:22:07] him and then that way you won't exalt
[1:22:11] yourself you'll exalt the other
[1:22:16] person a good orator every you may big
[1:22:19] old words a good speaker a good speaker
[1:22:22] if you got any sense at all if he ain't
[1:22:24] ain't a good speaker but if he's a good
[1:22:26] speaker he'll Elevate
[1:22:30] you
[1:22:31] right he'll Elevate you
[1:22:35] right right a good speaker is one who
[1:22:39] gets the
[1:22:41] contact you wonder sometimes why I life
[1:22:43] in some sermons and some I
[1:22:50] don't but you see a lot of the things
[1:22:53] that I've said you'll never
[1:22:57] forget if I had have brought out the
[1:22:59] illustration of my brother and what he
[1:23:02] thinks you know that you'll remember
[1:23:04] that more than you will remember any of
[1:23:05] the other things I
[1:23:08] said anybody's got any sense as an
[1:23:10] orator tries to get you involved in what
[1:23:13] they're doing you remember that brother
[1:23:16] brother dick that said and you watch it
[1:23:18] the preacher preacher will say okay now
[1:23:20] now now brother Mar you get the
[1:23:23] scripture of this and brother randam
[1:23:24] does it and he'll say Brother Gary now
[1:23:27] you get this scripture sister so and so
[1:23:29] you get this scripture what's he
[1:23:31] doing he's getting you involved in his
[1:23:35] message brother Ernie vill Anda is a
[1:23:38] perfect
[1:23:41] orator because that's what he does he
[1:23:44] gets you
[1:23:46] involved you remember better that way
[1:23:49] that's true you not not remember a thing
[1:23:52] that happened brother Gary remember I
[1:23:54] read that one
[1:23:59] scripture I'm just trying my best to get
[1:24:02] you to see Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ what good would it do to see him
[1:24:09] in me other than can help you for God to
[1:24:12] help
[1:24:13] you brother R said the
[1:24:16] gift will never heal
[1:24:21] nobody
[1:24:24] but yet he lived so close to God until
[1:24:26] he said you bring me 24 cases your worst
[1:24:30] cases and I'll guarantee you healing for
[1:24:32] every one of
[1:24:34] them I ain't going to open my mouth that
[1:24:39] way because I can't guarantee
[1:24:43] it but there's been times that I've
[1:24:45] walked out here and said it won't rain
[1:24:47] till I call for
[1:24:50] it then I came back to the pull pit and
[1:24:53] I said you better roll up your windows
[1:24:54] and your cars going to rain tonight and
[1:24:57] it
[1:24:59] did that doesn't make me anything it
[1:25:02] makes a great God Amen because you can
[1:25:06] have all of those gifts and still be
[1:25:12] lost I just want to see everybody saved
[1:25:16] am I don't care who it is right hell
[1:25:20] wasn't made for people
[1:25:24] the Bible said hell was made for the
[1:25:26] devil and his
[1:25:29] angels people are going to be
[1:25:31] trespassers
[1:25:35] there do you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:37] come on
[1:25:39] Brothers the son of man is the Lord
[1:25:41] Jesus
[1:25:44] Christ brother brandom is not the son of
[1:25:46] man you said well you keep saying and
[1:25:50] youve said it over and over that he he
[1:25:52] was not the son of man but we're going
[1:25:54] to be the son of man I didn't say
[1:25:56] that I correct you brother Bram said
[1:26:00] it I'm smart enough to not be a
[1:26:04] dummy I read you what brother bandam
[1:26:06] says he's the one that said the bride
[1:26:08] would be the fullness of the godhead
[1:26:10] bodily he's the one that said the red on
[1:26:12] grain be restored in the bride he's the
[1:26:14] one that says the bride is the son of
[1:26:17] man so now you got to argue with
[1:26:21] him you see I believe the ministry of
[1:26:24] Jesus Christ is here
[1:26:26] today around the world but not in one
[1:26:31] person no
[1:26:34] way it's around the world we've only got
[1:26:38] our little
[1:26:39] part so let's manifest our little part
[1:26:42] let's stand go ahead
[1:26:51] brother
[1:26:52] think on these
[1:26:57] things upon the
[1:27:02] Lord you'll sing on I've lost my
[1:27:06] voice he'll come back in a few minutes
[1:27:09] I'll be able to sing think about
[1:27:13] it giv all the honor and glory to Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ not to anybody but Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ thank
[1:27:26] God how many of
