[7:38] thing to have Victory amen um you know I
[7:42] I know most of you I'll share this with
[7:44] you for a second cuz it just reminded me
[7:46] of this we've always seen that sign and
[7:49] I've always known it as a peace sign
[7:51] I've known it as back in the 60s and'
[7:53] 70s people would do this but I see that
[7:56] a lot around the world and I started to
[7:58] research it I kind of thought well why
[8:00] is everybody throwing up peace and I
[8:02] realize in other places it doesn't mean
[8:05] the same as we thought it does this is a
[8:08] V for victory yes in a lot of places

[18:21] we're fervently and prayer for the ones
[18:23] that are not with us anymore Lord that
[18:25] have went astray that that we don't see
[18:27] anymore father that we we long to see
[18:30] again father I pray that you'd just send
[18:32] your Holy Spirit to them and and strike
[18:35] their heart Lord and they'll come back
[18:37] to you father Lord bless this day
[18:39] forgive us of our many faults and
[18:40] failures against you we love you Lord
[18:42] for all the things you give us in Jesus
[18:44] name amen you got your Bibles let's turn
[18:47] to Revelations 1 we're going to uh talk
[18:50] a little bit more about the son of man
[18:53] uh Wednesday night um if you didn't uh
[18:57] hear that then Wednesday night tonight
[18:59] um it was something that we're going to
[19:02] continue on with telling about who the
[19:05] son of man is and the Son of God all
[19:08] right because it's the same person it's
[19:10] the same God everybody with me same God
[19:14] same Holy Ghost but different
[19:17] dispensation different
[19:19] manifestation all right the son of man
[19:22] lived among humans in a human body all
[19:26] right the Son of God lives in
[19:29] humans all right is everybody with me we
[19:32] can see the son of man see that's why
[19:35] when we get into this a little bit more
[19:37] you'll see that the son of man remember
[19:40] he said you can speak against the son of
[19:42] man and be forgiven why because he was a
[19:44] human mortal man learned by the things
[19:47] he suffered was made perfect oh yeah he
[19:50] was perfect on the inside but his body
[19:51] he had to eat he had to drink he had to
[19:53] sleep he had to do all the things the
[19:55] functions that you and I do because the
[19:56] Bible said he was tempted in all points
[19:59] as you are so everything you got tempted
[20:02] Jesus got tempted also but without sin
[20:04] see sometimes we we head toward the
[20:07] adamic nature again and and fall back
[20:09] and we do what we fall he never fell he
[20:12] never had to say father forgive me
[20:15] that's right but now that's the son of
[20:16] man that's what we've got to come to
[20:19] amen that's what we're we're required in
[20:22] this age to to be the son of man in a
[20:24] collective body in the end time right
[20:28] all right but the Son of God is to live
[20:30] inside somebody Jesus said he said you
[20:31] can you can say something against me and
[20:33] be forgiven he said but if you say
[20:36] something against the Holy Ghost why
[20:37] because that Holy Ghost is transferred
[20:39] into a human
[20:41] being and that human being is your judge
[20:44] if you've got the Holy Ghost today
[20:45] you're part of as we were talking about
[20:47] Wednesday the righteous
[20:50] judge why you take PE you're not
[20:52] supposed to take people to
[20:53] court brothers are not supposed to take
[20:56] Brothers to court that's wrong that's
[20:57] not even the well it is in the Bible it
[20:59] tells you you're wrong cuz you're
[21:01] supposed to judge here amen supposed to
[21:04] judge here don't worry about it there
[21:06] now listen if somebody hits you and
[21:08] knocks you off the road that ain't your
[21:11] brother unless one of y'all hit each
[21:13] other that don't mean about not taking
[21:16] cuz I had a question about that that it
[21:18] says a
[21:19] brother a brother two brothers sitting
[21:22] in this
[21:23] church okay needs to get together and
[21:27] come to an agreement not having to take
[21:30] somebody to court and sue them and all
[21:32] that stuff Christians should never sue a
[21:34] Christian but now as far as them out
[21:36] there that's the world that's different
[21:39] that's not Brothers out there that's the
[21:41] world so if somebody hits you and Wrongs
[21:43] you get you an attorney if you feel led
[21:46] to cuz they're not see what the problem
[21:48] is is you got the Holy Ghost they
[21:51] don't so they're always going to be
[21:53] contrary all right they're always going
[21:55] to see things different too all right
[21:59] so let's uh let's continue let's read
[22:01] and get into this now remember I had a
[22:04] brother send me a message the other
[22:06] day brother rown says there's no
[22:09] Messenger to this age that we're talking
[22:11] about all right which is the Pentecostal
[22:14] age ausa Street
[22:18] 1906 everybody with
[22:20] me now also we're going to see though
[22:22] that if we're Alpha and Omega in the
[22:24] alpha Al Alpha Church age there was no
[22:27] Messenger to to that Pentecostal age
[22:30] Peter was the spokesperson he wasn't the
[22:33] messenger they were waiting on a
[22:35] messenger named
[22:36] Paul Hallelujah in 1906 the Holy Ghost
[22:40] came himself but they were looking
[22:41] waiting for a messenger to come to
[22:43] straighten out all the Loose Ends so the
[22:46] two are just mere images of each other
[22:48] Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on
[22:50] the Lord's day I heard behind me a great
[22:52] voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha
[22:55] and Omega the first and the last in
[22:56] other words the first church age and the
[22:58] last Church age have got to be M images
[23:02] we just get a plus cuz we're heading to
[23:03] a body change all right what thou seest
[23:07] write in the book and send it to the
[23:08] seven churches and I turned to see the
[23:10] voice that spake with me and turned I
[23:11] saw seven golden candlesticks what had
[23:14] done God had divided
[23:16] himself when John saw him on Earth there
[23:18] was one Jesus the son of man now he was
[23:21] looking when he turned and looked he saw
[23:23] seven candlesticks spread out over seven
[23:26] Church ages 2,000 years the church ages
[23:29] but he saw Jesus standing in the midst
[23:31] of it so he knew Jesus didn't leave he
[23:33] was just coming into the people clothed
[23:36] with the Garment down to the foot and G
[23:37] about the pouch with a golden
[23:39] girdle so now Acts 2
[23:42] verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was
[23:44] fully come they were all with one Accord
[23:47] in one place and suddenly there came a
[23:49] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[23:51] Wind and it filled all the house where
[23:53] they were sitting and there appeared
[23:55] unto them clothing tongues like as of
[23:56] fire and it sat upon each of them and
[23:59] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[24:00] what about 120 people that didn't have
[24:02] it when they walked in and had it when
[24:05] they walked out oh what a mighty God we
[24:08] serve and there appeared on them clo
[24:10] tongues like as of fire and it sat upon
[24:11] each of them and they were all filled
[24:13] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[24:15] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[24:17] them utterance you may be seated the
[24:18] Lord at his Blessing we're going to get
[24:20] into the isua street part probably this
[24:23] afternoon and show you that if you've
[24:26] never read about the isua street
[24:29] Revival you need to probably look on
[24:31] YouTube and and and and see what
[24:35] happened those
[24:37] people man the Holy Ghost was so
[24:39] powerful a policeman walked in the door
[24:42] to quiet him down and as soon as he
[24:43] walked in he got slain in the spirit and
[24:45] got the Holy Ghost during that meeting
[24:46] and began and joined them he was as loud
[24:48] as they was then you say that's funny
[24:51] that's the Holy Ghost that's how it's
[24:52] supposed to work but what happens we
[24:55] have all this I don't this and I ain't
[24:56] this and I don't that and you know this
[24:58] and you know that I don't this that's
[25:00] what happened because there was one I
[25:03] was watching it last night there was one
[25:04] older black sister that she was in the
[25:07] isua Street Revival this was a 1976
[25:10] interview and she said the greatest
[25:12] thing that came out of the isza Street
[25:14] Revival was that everybody loved
[25:18] everybody then by 1915 when the Revival
[25:21] was over they split and you know what
[25:24] she said she said man got involved right
[25:27] oh boy she was she was preaching she
[25:29] knew what she's talking about man got
[25:31] involved and then they got Assembly of
[25:33] God you watch brother brandom he said
[25:34] y'all had it you had it in Aza Street
[25:38] and now you split into this one
[25:39] assemblies one one this one one don't
[25:42] have a uh any instruments and one has
[25:45] instruments then you got Jesus only and
[25:46] they baptizing only in Jesus name and
[25:48] they all just man just split apart but
[25:51] the whole thing was there was 600
[25:53] million people were impacted by that one
[25:55] Revival in Ona Street one Revival in one
[25:59] mission that used to be a
[26:01] stable and a oneeyed black man
[26:04] preached and I'll read you what he said
[26:06] tonight this
[26:08] afternoon he wanted more of God he
[26:10] prayed five hours a day he said the Lord
[26:13] spoke to him and said pray some
[26:16] more so he started praying seven hours a
[26:18] day and that's when the Holy Ghost came
[26:20] on on isza Street on that day and filled
[26:23] him with the Holy Ghost and then here he
[26:25] started a Revival that went around the
[26:26] world so if you I pray enough we never
[26:29] pray enough amen we never do so if you
[26:32] look and see on the chart I think you
[26:34] can see that you see that started with a
[26:36] Pentecostal age it started with a
[26:39] Pentecostal age no Messenger to that age
[26:42] because Paul was not
[26:44] there amen Peter was a spokesperson that
[26:47] was somebody had to
[26:49] speak this is that all right he had to
[26:53] read the scripture this is
[26:55] that then you come all through the
[26:57] church ages well what happened during
[26:58] that church age all those Church ages
[27:01] man got involved again split split it
[27:05] off it didn't have to say Baptist
[27:06] Methodist that just come up in the our
[27:08] age but they split off into factions and
[27:10] you come up to Wesley and then from
[27:13] Wesley because um daddy they called him
[27:16] daddy Seymour William Seymour the black
[27:18] one eyy black man he had one eye because
[27:21] he had some uh tuberculosis or something
[27:22] when he was younger and it or sugar or
[27:24] something it knocked his eye out put his
[27:26] eye out but when he started preaching he
[27:28] was a Methodist
[27:29] preacher but God impressed in him one
[27:32] thing there's
[27:34] more there's more that's all God told
[27:36] him there's more he didn't tell him what
[27:38] he didn't tell him what scripture to
[27:40] read he said there's more so Daddy see
[27:44] more he come from Louisiana to
[27:47] Indiana to Houston Texas and then out to
[27:50] Los Angeles we'll look at it this
[27:51] afternoon that he
[27:53] actually was the one that spearheaded
[27:56] the whole thing just by
[27:58] telling the people there was one more
[28:00] work of Grace one more work because
[28:03] everybody from the Methodist though
[28:05] remember now sanctification under
[28:07] Methodist did put you into
[28:10] body it gave you the Holy Ghost under
[28:13] that anointing under Wesley's anointing
[28:15] the Holy Ghost fell on the
[28:17] sanctification the Sanctified life that
[28:19] they had but remember there was
[28:22] more God moved on Wesley people stopped
[28:25] I didn't say Wesley Wesley's people
[28:27] stopped so God said there's one more act
[28:30] that I got to get inside of you so that
[28:32] I can work through you cuz it got eroded
[28:36] so much down through time Doctrine is
[28:38] what kills us folks it's not your
[28:41] neighbor Doctrine is what kills us we
[28:45] must say under the correct Doctrine or
[28:47] we die that's right even with the Holy
[28:52] Ghost don't get quiet even with the Holy
[28:55] Ghost you can be sitting under false
[28:56] Doctrine but somewhere truth is
[28:59] presented to you you got to accept it
[29:01] that's why some of the people in
[29:02] Pentecost
[29:04] 1906 accepted brother brandom and saw
[29:06] that there was something even greater
[29:08] than just speaking in tongues was the
[29:10] evidence and they moved with him but the
[29:12] rest of them stayed stayed and said no
[29:14] this is it if you speak in tongues you
[29:16] got it don't matter how you
[29:21] live that's what they said speak in
[29:23] tongues and that's
[29:25] it so now look we were talking about the
[29:27] SE and we're going to get into the seals
[29:29] a little bit
[29:30] later but the first three seals that
[29:32] looses a Ministry in those first three
[29:34] Church ages even into Luther and Wesley
[29:37] and we come now to I was talking to
[29:40] somebody the other day and and they
[29:42] heard me make a statement that that
[29:43] we're living under the fourth
[29:45] seal well we
[29:49] are why the Rapture takes place on the
[29:52] four seale okay don't worry about time
[29:55] elements this is where the Rapture takes
[29:57] place Place brother Brown tells you in
[30:00] the fourth seal he says the Rapture
[30:02] takes place on the fourth seal because
[30:04] the combat Beast are gone in the fifth
[30:06] seal so that must mean that we're out of
[30:09] here the bride's gone all right but
[30:11] we'll get to that a little bit later
[30:13] some confusion to some you say well what
[30:14] about 56 and 7 56 and 7 is to take you
[30:18] to a body
[30:20] change cuz five is the greatest part of
[30:23] Grace and justification amen Wesley had
[30:26] sanctification but there's a great part
[30:28] of sanctification and that's in this
[30:29] right
[30:30] here then there's a greater feeling as
[30:32] we were talking Wednesday night I if you
[30:34] didn't watch look this is the Holy Ghost
[30:36] right here you receive the Holy Ghost in
[30:38] baby form right here amen all right then
[30:40] you grow in Grace and knowledge that's
[30:42] another that's not another Holy Spirit
[30:45] but it's another Act of that same holy
[30:48] spirit cuz remember you can quench the
[30:52] spirit your attitude that's right your
[30:55] way of doing things you can quench the
[30:58] spirit of God and you can hold
[31:02] it a that what the Bible said grieve not
[31:06] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[31:08] sealed brother BR said you grieve the
[31:10] holy spirit said he'll walk go out on
[31:12] the limb what does he do he doesn't come
[31:13] out of you come on people it's just an
[31:16] analogy have you ever been where you
[31:18] walked in dry places but you knew you
[31:21] were a
[31:24] Christian you were I mean you know
[31:26] you've had the experience you know
[31:27] you've had had the new
[31:29] birth but you're like Lord where are
[31:34] you where are you you help me in this
[31:36] well yeah you were a baby over
[31:39] here you helped your kids when they were
[31:41] little
[31:43] right
[31:44] righten we still helping them when we're
[31:46] older but let's don't all Shake our head
[31:49] about that but uh we
[31:52] are but we're not supposed to
[31:54] be right we're supposed to grow up Paul
[31:57] said what desire the sinal milk of the
[32:00] word but grow
[32:02] up all right grow up quit being
[32:05] babies it's okay being a baby it's not
[32:08] okay to stay a baby right so the opening
[32:11] of the seals tells us then the opening
[32:14] of the seals tells
[32:16] us that it's not just that as we were
[32:18] talking Wednesday night there's
[32:20] something leaving when that seal open
[32:22] something left when the second seal open
[32:25] something left
[32:28] yes come and see that was a true word
[32:32] lion ox man and Eagle over here saying
[32:34] John John John taed to what the bride
[32:37] John come and see not come and see come
[32:41] and understand what's happening John
[32:45] didn't know everything that was going on
[32:48] but he knew enough to know that when
[32:50] that Thunder went off he was about to
[32:52] write it down and God said no don't
[32:54] write
[32:54] it why cuz it's a revelation contained
[32:57] in the seals that we got in the end time
[33:00] that that John may have not known
[33:02] exactly what that black horse
[33:05] did but he did see
[33:07] it but we know what that black horse
[33:10] does we know what the Pale Horse does we
[33:12] know what the red horse does because
[33:15] remember John can be
[33:18] fooled because he was fooled in Book of
[33:21] Revelations because remember he stood
[33:23] and
[33:24] admired the
[33:28] remember the angel had to say
[33:31] John he admired her why you get caught
[33:35] up in all this pretty let's don't get
[33:37] caught up in all this
[33:39] pretty that is the street Mission they
[33:42] had to sweep the horse poop off of the
[33:44] floor to have a because it was a
[33:46] stable but the Holy Ghost was glad to be
[33:49] in that building with those
[33:50] people loved to be there that's where he
[33:53] wanted it to
[33:54] be same way with me and you but there
[33:57] was a Ministry loose there's always a a
[33:59] true Ministry and a false Ministry
[34:01] always loose together the true Ministry
[34:04] goes out first then there's a false that
[34:06] follows behind it all right and anything
[34:09] contrary to God is false absolutely okay
[34:13] one word off as Brother Richard Wilson
[34:15] said one word off got us over
[34:18] here where that horse was
[34:21] riding I was reading I didn't bring a
[34:24] quote I think I'll bring it this
[34:25] afternoon but it was back in the the 50s
[34:28] brother R was preaching and he said see
[34:29] there he was reading
[34:32] Revelations where the six the fifth seal
[34:34] Jew he said that was the Saints under
[34:36] the altar well he was
[34:39] wrong people hate it when you say that
[34:42] amen he said he was wrong I didn't have
[34:45] to tell you he said he was wrong he said
[34:47] I have made a horrible mistake he said
[34:48] I've been looking at my old notes and
[34:50] it's totally contrary to what I was
[34:51] preaching before but thank God he knew
[34:53] right then to me I'd rather like Dad
[34:56] said I'd rather know that I was WR wrong
[34:58] right
[35:00] then cuz he knew then he was working in
[35:02] a real that it wasn't him it was
[35:05] God it wasn't his ideas filtered through
[35:08] God's mind no it was God's mind
[35:10] filtering through his telling him the
[35:13] truth those were Souls under the altar
[35:15] crying how long to avenge our blood
[35:17] Christians don't do that that's
[35:19] right okay I believe in progressive
[35:22] revelation you progressed as a human
[35:24] didn't
[35:26] you but there was a Ministry loosed in
[35:28] those first church ages there was a
[35:30] Ministry loosed in every Church age am
[35:32] all right so the first three ages the
[35:34] pure word of God and we'll get to this
[35:36] in just a minute I want you to see
[35:37] something because when the Holy Ghost
[35:39] fell under the day of Pentecost ad30 or
[35:43] 33 brother around says to but back there
[35:46] that fell on a different group of
[35:50] people hello then what fell in 1906
[35:54] that's right not the different for Holy
[35:56] Ghost I said different
[35:58] people these people here were tutored by
[36:01] God himself they had been Justified they
[36:04] had been Sanctified Jesus said sanctify
[36:07] them through thy truth th word there was
[36:08] a pure word of God and when that Holy
[36:10] Ghost Struck it they took off they were
[36:13] what faith of the
[36:15] fathers everybody with me now over here
[36:17] in the zeusa street that was not true
[36:20] they were they were
[36:22] trinitarians they baptized the name of
[36:24] father son Holy Ghost they let women
[36:27] pray
[36:28] pre all those things over here but the
[36:31] Holy Ghost fell and was pleased to fall
[36:32] on them just as pleased as he was to
[36:35] fall in this group over here cuz
[36:37] remember God's not a respected persons
[36:38] and he can't change all right he fa the
[36:42] same way but what they did with it was
[36:44] two different things all right so that's
[36:46] why we need to learn how to
[36:48] grow we can go through dark times we can
[36:51] go through these ups and downs but
[36:53] there's got to come a time to where you
[36:54] know that you know that you know that
[36:56] you're standing in a place you're
[36:57] supposed to be standing in you're not
[36:59] standing back here you're standing in
[37:01] this age right here
[37:03] today and when the word comes to you you
[37:05] go what you just like had it right that
[37:07] ain't nothing but the
[37:09] truth amen hallelujah so the fourth
[37:13] Church age the word went into the ground
[37:16] it died the word didn't die we know that
[37:19] the effects of the word
[37:20] died right but Jesus said except the
[37:23] corn of wheat fall to the ground it's
[37:24] going to abide
[37:26] alone right right so it had to go
[37:28] through the process of justification cuz
[37:31] all that was lost I want y'all to
[37:32] understand something when brother random
[37:34] comes and preaches and he starts
[37:36] preaching on justification and
[37:38] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[37:39] Ghost that's what param uh and William
[37:42] Seymour had already preached that wasn't
[37:44] something
[37:46] new what was though they said this is it
[37:50] no more brother Brown said this is it
[37:54] plus this is it plus the growth you got
[37:57] to grow you can't speak in tongues and
[37:59] have a like brother Brown said a temper
[38:00] to fight a buz saw you can't do that all
[38:03] right that's
[38:07] Pentecostal so the fifth Church age we
[38:09] see that come the justification it was
[38:12] preached correct but it was not the
[38:15] fullness it was only what
[38:19] restoration it was reforming but it was
[38:22] becoming restoration but they were
[38:23] reforming the
[38:25] people into seeing that the just as we
[38:28] were talking Wednesday night the just
[38:30] will live by faith there's no there's no
[38:32] other requirement to a Believer except
[38:37] believe you see all these other things
[38:39] it all comes down to believing why did
[38:41] you get up this morning why did you put
[38:43] on your clothes why did you come to this
[38:46] church or any other Church
[38:48] why I hope you believe that God was
[38:51] going to see you here meet you here and
[38:53] help you
[38:54] here if not you just came here to to as
[38:58] brother R said sometimes people just
[39:00] come to church just to refute what's
[39:01] going
[39:05] on I you don't have to amen none of that
[39:07] if you don't want to but it's the truth
[39:09] anyhow the devil got here before y'all
[39:11] did oh yeah okay he's still here
[39:14] now
[39:17] amen but we got to come to a place
[39:20] though that we know that our sins are
[39:22] forgiven the just will live by faith and
[39:25] that you're just as just as God is if
[39:28] you have the new
[39:29] birth oh I don't I don't see
[39:33] there take the eye
[39:35] out and put the hym in yes sir I can't
[39:40] no you can't because you just said you
[39:42] can't the Bible says I can't do all
[39:44] things who Christ not what he say he
[39:48] said I can do all things through Christ
[39:51] that strengthens me all things oh I got
[39:55] this struggle I got this F
[39:59] so nobody's went through what Jesus went
[40:02] through they hated him his whole life
[40:05] rejected him and killed him
[40:08] yes so justification now remember it
[40:11] eradicates by faith in what Christ did
[40:13] the sins of your past nature even in the
[40:15] Book of Romans it tells us we were
[40:17] talking about Wednesday night it
[40:19] declares his
[40:21] righteousness for the remission of sins
[40:23] that are passed you can't ask God to for
[40:26] you know you know well as I do
[40:28] tomorrow's Monday and if you work you're
[40:30] going to sin I don't know about you that
[40:31] are retired but if you work you're going
[40:33] to sin yeah boss is going to do
[40:35] something the somebody's going to cut
[40:37] you off on the highway hello well y'all
[40:40] pray for
[40:41] me Monday's the worst day at the post
[40:43] office so this just Monday's a bad
[40:45] day but um you know what that's not
[40:49] supposed to affect
[40:51] you come on I'm looking at every one of
[40:54] you that's not supposed to affect you
[40:57] you're supposed to stand up above that
[40:59] let everybody else around you complain
[41:01] and Rattle and Roll and and and uh I
[41:04] didn't this and I couldn't get out of
[41:06] the bed and I somebody you're supposed
[41:09] to say how you doing
[41:12] wonderful brother Dale says perfect fine
[41:15] I'm good all is
[41:17] well have we heard that message as the
[41:19] Bible as the song says have we heard the
[41:22] message Shalom have we heard that all is
[41:25] well have we heard to me that's the good
[41:26] news that everything's
[41:29] okay don't matter if the world's falling
[41:31] apart they're in political
[41:33] turmoil Iraq
[41:36] Iran hallelujah it's going to happen yes
[41:39] but we've been equipped for it I'll read
[41:42] you this
[41:43] afternoon we're in the astronaut
[41:47] age we' really got way up
[41:50] now that's right but I'll give you a
[41:53] little I give you a little uh a little
[41:55] hint in 19 1906 when the Holy Ghost Fell
[41:58] onusa Street brother brandham said that
[42:00] was the
[42:03] airplane the right Brothers flew their
[42:06] first plane in
[42:09] 1905 by
[42:11] 1907 they had um produced a fixed wi
[42:17] airplane brother BR said whatever man
[42:20] whatever God's doing man duplicates it
[42:22] on Earth so when God came to the
[42:24] countdown brother I'm preaching the
[42:25] countdown that we're an astronaut age
[42:27] guess what they started shooting people
[42:29] up in the sky and now we can fly them up
[42:31] there in the same vehicle and bring them
[42:33] back in the same vehicle all right so
[42:35] let's just do the same way with the word
[42:37] of God because remember there's no limit
[42:39] out there we're limited to gravity here
[42:42] once you hit past gravity There's No
[42:45] Limit don't let Gravity the gravity of
[42:47] sin Hold Us Down the gravity of worrying
[42:50] and wondering and I know it's hard to do
[42:53] as a human but you got to believe
[42:58] that
[42:59] God is in everything you
[43:03] do everything now the garbage
[43:07] no but sometimes we have to go through
[43:09] garbage to get to the truth amen
[43:13] everybody all right so he's going to
[43:15] we're going to ask for our sins to be
[43:17] forgiven which is the sins we've done in
[43:19] the past you can't ask for forgiveness
[43:20] the sins you've done in the future
[43:21] because you don't know that you've done
[43:23] those God's not listen God doesn't just
[43:25] throw a blanket out there you you got to
[43:27] ask him to forgive you what you
[43:30] done Lord just forgive me next day Lord
[43:32] just forgive me forgive you what he
[43:34] wants you to confess cuz he's the high
[43:36] priest of your confession confess to him
[43:39] what you did hallu
[43:42] amen therefore we conclude a man is
[43:45] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[43:47] the law as brother Luis was talking
[43:49] about the law laws want to kill you all
[43:52] right but Justified freely means it
[43:54] doesn't mean that you're forgiven we got
[43:57] to come to the conclusion that we never
[43:59] did it we've actually got to come to the
[44:01] Revelation that we never did it amen and
[44:04] if you're born again
[44:07] today everybody close your eyes every
[44:10] person in this building close your
[44:12] eyes your inner being is all you can see
[44:16] right now all right you don't see in
[44:18] your neighbor you don't see tomorrow
[44:20] yesterday your soul if it's born again
[44:24] is just as Eternal as God is and when
[44:27] you open your eyes you're opening The
[44:29] Eyes Of God now do we believe that amen
[44:33] okay open your eyes then you Open The
[44:34] Eyes Of God if you're born again in your
[44:38] soul you're just as the Eternal as God
[44:40] is look you're
[44:42] just but we got to work on that second
[44:44] man the memory reason conscious
[44:47] affection that's what we're preaching to
[44:48] now brother Dell said remember he always
[44:51] preach of the Soul that's what we're
[44:52] doing but once you get the soul
[44:53] converted you got to head toward the
[44:55] outside guy right that's what this is
[44:58] for
[45:03] yes cuz remember if you're soul is the
[45:05] soul of God is that all right that's
[45:08] right if your soul by the new birth is
[45:10] the soul of
[45:14] God it's already got
[45:16] them but the problem is though we've got
[45:19] a piece around it like this it's called
[45:21] Humanity it's called your old
[45:25] nature it's a cap capsulated that Holy
[45:28] Ghost and won't let it out but just
[45:29] every once in a
[45:32] while that's how I remember it was
[45:34] sealed up that's why brother R had to
[45:36] come he had to come to unseal what the
[45:40] word of God in its Purity to show us
[45:43] we're already redeemed we're already
[45:45] sitting in Heavenly places we're already
[45:49] perfect we just got to walk to it what
[45:52] is sanctification it's a walk
[45:55] justification is one act God for for
[45:57] gives you your sins throws you in the
[45:58] sea of forgetfulness right here God can
[46:00] see your sin no more for they're buried
[46:02] they're buried in the sea of
[46:04] forgetfulness think of a sea of
[46:06] forgetfulness God cannot remember them
[46:08] no more so why do we bring them
[46:11] up why do we keep bringing them up cuz
[46:15] Satan is the one that reminds us of that
[46:17] God's not going to remind you of your
[46:19] sins if he forgives you of them listen
[46:21] you know why he
[46:23] can't you say my God can do everything
[46:26] but there's one thing I I know he can't
[46:27] do he can't remember my
[46:30] sins if a in to see of God's
[46:32] forgetfulness never ever ever will I
[46:36] have to be forgiven for that again now
[46:38] we sin every day so it continues on but
[46:41] you got to come to a place to where if
[46:43] your soul is born again today it never
[46:45] did
[46:46] Sin that peace and part of God will get
[46:48] to the Genesis 126 man when we get into
[46:50] the seals that's where that person come
[46:52] from that's where you hear from your
[46:54] theophany that's where you sitting in
[46:56] Heavenly places listen on Monday morning
[46:59] at work you're not sitting in Heavenly
[47:01] places but your soul is yes sir by the
[47:04] new birth so that's why I keep saying
[47:06] let it out let that joy and peace let it
[47:10] out why get bound down with so much
[47:15] garbage man I mean just let it go and
[47:18] keep going let it go and keep going
[47:21] because they are both dead and buried it
[47:23] cannot be even remembered by God anymore
[47:26] that's right
[47:27] can't be remembered by God yeah that's
[47:29] something he can't
[47:30] do he can't remember my sins but you
[47:33] know what he had to choose that and make
[47:35] a place for it and where it was at under
[47:38] the blood when he died at Calvary that's
[47:40] the Sea of God's forgetfulness that sea
[47:43] is red if you didn't know what that was
[47:44] it's not a blue sea it's a Red
[47:48] Sea why do you think the children of
[47:50] Israel had to go through the Red
[47:55] Sea why was it called the Red Sea why
[47:58] was the Wilderness called the Wilderness
[48:00] of
[48:03] sin not by not by
[48:06] chance no not by chance because remember
[48:09] everything they did was an example for
[48:11] us yes as brother Luis was talking this
[48:13] morning it's all an example but we got
[48:16] to get out from under the law so that
[48:18] Grace can take over but then you know if
[48:21] we were if we were real legalistic we'd
[48:24] be sitting here just like I was and I
[48:26] was listening watching brother Lis and
[48:27] I'm like man it's just Grace everywhere
[48:29] just slather it with with sugar and then
[48:32] brother collie reads that that you got
[48:34] higher powers and you got to listen to
[48:36] them so it looks like two different
[48:38] things but if you mold them together
[48:39] it's the exact same
[48:41] thing exact same thing brother collie
[48:43] read the same thing brother Luis was
[48:44] talking about he just did it brother
[48:46] brother they did both did it with the
[48:48] Holy Ghost but you got brother collie
[48:50] reading it to where we got to be
[48:51] submissive to the higher power we got to
[48:53] have rules and regulations we got to
[48:56] have certain things but we don't have
[48:58] to Louise beat everybody over see so you
[49:03] put the two
[49:04] together it's law and Grace but Grace is
[49:07] what greater than law all
[49:10] right Grace is what put Christ in on the
[49:13] cross right wasn't his wasn't for him it
[49:16] was for us for our Grace so there's the
[49:20] Tabernacle and we see the outer Court
[49:21] was you got all kind of stuff going on
[49:24] in justification you still got all kind
[49:26] of stuff going on on I young people
[49:28] don't get discouraged if you make that
[49:30] move with God and then all hell breaks
[49:33] loose cuz you know what all hell's going
[49:35] to break
[49:36] loose I'll promise you
[49:38] that amen yes sir did with
[49:42] me but what is Satan is trying to upset
[49:46] because remember he's
[49:48] spiritual he can feel a spirit before
[49:50] you
[49:52] can he can actually fill the spirit of
[49:55] God before you can
[49:57] oh yeah he can he's more spiritual than
[50:00] we are he's in that spiritual realm
[50:01] where everything happen boom boom boom
[50:03] boom boom and we're in this realm where
[50:05] it just happens it's so
[50:07] slow that's why brother Brown said you
[50:09] make a move toward God what does he say
[50:12] Satan moves Satan moves in and tries to
[50:15] what cut that
[50:17] off many many times he said in the in
[50:19] prayer lines don't let s don't let Satan
[50:22] cut that off he said get the
[50:25] blessing he is a spiritual creature
[50:27] don't ever forget that Satan's spiritual
[50:31] sir he's not a natural human being he's
[50:34] a spiritual being God made to stay in
[50:36] one place and he didn't all right so
[50:39] let's move on just a minute to
[50:41] sanctification cuz we're going to come
[50:43] to something this
[50:44] afternoon to where when they went to
[50:47] isua Street they were living under a
[50:50] Sanctified life no jewelry no watches
[50:53] long you know just like the old we used
[50:55] to see the old Pentecostal that's what
[50:57] they started under because that's what
[50:59] sanctification was to them that's what
[51:01] the Holy Ghost was to them was trying to
[51:03] put on you hear me people trying to put
[51:06] on a Pure Life right you can put on all
[51:09] you want to but someday somehow
[51:14] someway whatever our weakness is ours is
[51:17] going to pop up before usely you can
[51:20] suppress it you can do this you can even
[51:22] deny it but I'll promise you until that
[51:24] thing dies it'll always always come up
[51:28] but it's got to die and when it dies
[51:31] like brother Brown said I read y'all the
[51:32] other last Wednesday night when that
[51:35] when that sin dies there's no
[51:37] Resurrection for that sin absolutely
[51:39] there's Resurrection to life in Jesus
[51:41] Christ but there's no Resurrection for
[51:43] that if you confess it and put it under
[51:45] the blood it can never come back up you
[51:48] can't be
[51:49] accused we don't even have a statute of
[51:51] limitations in the in the in
[51:53] Christianity when you're s when you're
[51:55] done it's done yes when you're forgiven
[51:57] you're forgiven you don't have to go to
[51:59] court Christ went to court for you he
[52:01] said I'm pleading their
[52:03] case I am their Advocate I'm standing
[52:07] for them yes sir amen right that's why
[52:11] brother Brown said and the Bible said
[52:13] you stand for him he'll stand for you
[52:15] okay you had to make a stand to even get
[52:17] Justified and Sanctified you had to make
[52:19] a move yes you didn't just sit in your
[52:22] seat with your arms folded and slept
[52:23] during
[52:24] church there was something lit inside
[52:26] you called a fire and it was a fire of
[52:29] God it wasn't the holy ghost in your
[52:31] soul but it was the Holy Ghost cleaning
[52:33] you up so he can get in your soul that's
[52:35] what we need the same thing even with
[52:37] this right here we need this Holy Ghost
[52:39] right here give us some more
[52:42] fire amen you know they heat the fire
[52:44] seven
[52:47] times seven Church
[52:50] ages but remember at the very end when
[52:54] they went in that fire it didn't matter
[52:55] if they heated it 10 times 50 times cuz
[52:59] God was on the
[53:00] scene you know the belief
[53:03] was that he saved them in the fire and
[53:06] that would be cool brother Danny you
[53:08] know people tell the story that would be
[53:10] good but when they walked out the Bible
[53:12] even says that their their feathers were
[53:15] burnt to a crisp and their clothes
[53:18] didn't even smell like
[53:19] smoke that's how God cleans you up your
[53:23] clothes don't even smell like smoke what
[53:25] about a mighty God we serve he just
[53:26] cleaned them so much he put them in
[53:28] another
[53:30] dimension he put them in another
[53:32] dimension cuz in this Dimension they
[53:35] burn but then of course Nebuchadnezzar
[53:37] looked down and said hey I see four
[53:40] didn't we throw three yep I see
[53:43] four the Fourth Man In The Fire is one
[53:46] that'll save
[53:47] you amen so now remember the
[53:50] Philadelphian Church age was a great
[53:52] missionary age we'll get get to where we
[53:54] need to go but remember there was lap
[53:56] overs we we understand through the
[53:59] scriptures that each age laps over each
[54:02] other all right everybody with
[54:05] me there's not just an Abrupt end of
[54:08] sanctification and then you start with
[54:09] the Holy Ghost no param and seore and
[54:13] John G Lake and all the different ones
[54:14] back then they knew there was something
[54:16] else but they stayed in the
[54:18] sanctification until they did something
[54:20] come something else come all right and
[54:23] then when they started preaching that
[54:25] they knew that sanctification wasn't in
[54:27] it was just a second work of Grace see
[54:28] there's a revelation God was revealing
[54:30] to them God revealed to a oneeyed black
[54:33] man That Couldn't Write his
[54:35] name that there was another work of
[54:38] Grace called the baptism of the Holy
[54:40] Ghost
[54:43] amen they even said this I was reading
[54:45] or watching one this morning one of the
[54:47] old sisters she was in the zza Street
[54:48] Revival she was really old back in the
[54:50] 70s she said didn't matter it said you
[54:54] didn't ask what color the man was
[54:55] preaching
[54:58] the man just preached he said she said
[55:00] we didn't look at racial barriers we he
[55:02] said we had Chinese Russians there was a
[55:05] big Russian group out there in Los
[55:06] Angeles they had we had Russians but the
[55:09] whole thing was is it struck me because
[55:11] on the this day of Pentecost over here
[55:14] remember they spake with tongues right
[55:17] but remember what was strange was they
[55:19] were heard in their own language abut if
[55:22] Russians got up and spoke in tongue the
[55:25] Russian people heard it but the American
[55:27] people heard it in American
[55:29] language that sister said the same thing
[55:31] she said them Chinese start speaking in
[55:33] tongues and she said it was just like
[55:35] they was talking to me speaking in
[55:36] English so that's a way that God speaks
[55:40] to people not just speaking in tongues
[55:42] and babbling around and not saying
[55:44] nothing come
[55:45] on they heard in their own language the
[55:49] hearing is more than the
[55:51] speaking are you hearing in the language
[55:53] of God today are you hearing in the
[55:55] language that God has for this time
[55:57] today doesn't matter if I'm speaking in
[55:59] Russian or whatever it
[56:01] is are you hearing the voice of God are
[56:04] you hearing what God's got for us it's
[56:07] my question to
[56:10] you so what God had to do before isusa
[56:12] Street he had to clean the people up put
[56:14] them through Wesley where tea was not
[56:17] any good and don't wear any jewelry and
[56:19] do this and don't that they had a method
[56:22] of doing things that's why they're
[56:23] called methodists All right but then God
[56:26] was was ready and waiting though for
[56:28] somebody to catch a
[56:29] revelation so the oneeyed black man said
[56:32] he said God there's got to be more I'll
[56:33] read it to you tonight he said God
[56:35] there's got to be more and that's when
[56:37] God said pray more and he was already
[56:39] praying five hours a day how many of us
[56:42] pray five hours a week I don't want your
[56:45] hand
[56:46] up you never pray five hours a day
[56:48] though unless you pray without ceasing
[56:51] but there's sometimes
[56:53] that prayer is not appropriate to things
[56:56] we do hello yeah well pray for
[57:01] me sanctification is becoming more holy
[57:04] through
[57:05] time like Paul said I Die daily yes the
[57:08] things I used to do I don't do anymore
[57:10] yes sir right that's what we've got to
[57:13] do that's what that old sister said she
[57:16] said she said them old things we used to
[57:18] do she said they was gone said we walked
[57:21] into church and said said you could just
[57:23] one old man was there he was a minister
[57:25] and he said you could just F the Holy
[57:26] Spirit pick you
[57:27] up he said you could walk in a church
[57:31] anywhere in Aza Street or anywhere
[57:32] around there and he said it was like the
[57:34] Holy Ghost would just reach and grab you
[57:35] and pick you
[57:37] up you say that was for them same Holy
[57:41] Ghost we got more word than they did
[57:44] right we don't have we've got the
[57:46] unadulterated word of God that's what
[57:49] I'm going to hammer when we get to
[57:50] brother br's real true Ministry which
[57:52] was in the seals we got to come to a
[57:54] place
[57:57] see it's like a child growing into
[57:58] adulthood Christians become more
[58:00] Sanctified over time this means that
[58:03] Christians should expect to make
[58:07] progress if you've been doing something
[58:09] 20 years you're still doing it the same
[58:10] way you'd been doing it 20 years ago you
[58:12] got a problem we all got a
[58:15] problem so this means that Christians
[58:17] should expect to make progress to grow
[58:19] and become more loving kind humble and
[58:23] self-controlled over their life
[58:29] brother Brown says look said you're
[58:30] begotten of the spirit at sanctification
[58:32] that's why sanctification and the Holy
[58:33] Ghost is so
[58:35] close so close because what God does he
[58:38] cleans you out the unclean Spirit goes
[58:39] out you're trying to you're trying to
[58:41] live a a good life but remember if you
[58:45] exchange that for saying I got
[58:49] it because I feel it you're in the
[58:52] devil's territory right that's right God
[58:55] didn't say you feel it he said did you
[58:57] believe
[58:58] it did you believe it's for you do you
[59:01] believe it's
[59:03] for your children your husband your wife
[59:06] people that are not not
[59:08] saved but remember it's like brother
[59:11] Dale said always if you live like a
[59:14] hound dog and expect your kids to live
[59:16] like a Christian there's a problem
[59:19] there if your pre if your kids are not
[59:22] serving the lord look at your life don't
[59:23] look at theirs oh play God I
[59:27] do I look at mine to see what they're
[59:30] looking
[59:33] at you don't come to church they don't
[59:35] come to church you don't read your Bible
[59:38] they see you doing other things they see
[59:40] you cussing and or not cussing
[59:45] but
[59:48] amen we got to get back to that
[59:50] Sanctified life all of us do we all got
[59:52] to get back to being more Sanctified
[59:54] knowing that God will clean us up up so
[59:56] that our kids will want what we want
[59:59] what we got brother Brown said be
[1:00:03] salty don't don't I mean pray for them
[1:00:05] every day but live something in front of
[1:00:08] them don't
[1:00:10] compromise if you compromise that's the
[1:00:12] first thing your kids going to say h
[1:00:14] well Mom and Dad they don't come to
[1:00:16] church on Sunday afternoon they just you
[1:00:18] know we go out we well you won't have to
[1:00:20] worry about that in two
[1:00:24] weeks a baby got life in the womb little
[1:00:27] muscles are quivering it's a life all
[1:00:29] right see sanctification is a life CU
[1:00:32] it's an act of the Holy Ghost yes listen
[1:00:35] no one can clean you up except the Holy
[1:00:37] Ghost that's right that unclean Spirit
[1:00:40] cannot leave you without the Holy Ghost
[1:00:42] doing it cuz you don't want it to
[1:00:46] leave you pet the thing you like it
[1:00:49] ain't that what brother R said about
[1:00:51] that woman they saidwell that Spirit
[1:00:52] came back on that woman brother R said
[1:00:54] cuz she liked it
[1:00:57] the unclean Spirit goes
[1:00:59] out God had to drive it out but now
[1:01:02] remember God's a
[1:01:04] gentleman until you ask him to fill it
[1:01:07] with the Holy Ghost and seal it Satan
[1:01:10] can walk right back
[1:01:11] in and make you feel so
[1:01:14] religious and put all your signs up on
[1:01:16] the wall put all your all your uh cloud
[1:01:19] pictures and all that
[1:01:21] stuff and be just as dead as a
[1:01:24] doornail but it's a different life when
[1:01:26] it breathes the breath of life into its
[1:01:28] nostrils it's a different then he said
[1:01:30] my dear Methodist brother Pilgrim
[1:01:32] Holiness Nazarene these are the people
[1:01:34] that came out of that move in 1906 of
[1:01:35] zud
[1:01:36] Street the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:01:39] different from
[1:01:40] sanctification it's a work of but it's
[1:01:43] different sanctification is the
[1:01:45] cleansing which is preparation of
[1:01:48] life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[1:01:53] life preparation is cleaning the vessel
[1:01:56] the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel yes
[1:02:00] sanctification means clean and set aside
[1:02:01] for service the holy spirit is put in
[1:02:04] service you are the vessel that God has
[1:02:07] cleaned up all right is everybody with
[1:02:09] me all right real quick now we know we
[1:02:11] read about the unclean spirit so let's
[1:02:13] just keep going right here I want to see
[1:02:14] something right
[1:02:15] here now we know what the in court what
[1:02:18] was the in court the in court you might
[1:02:20] not be able to see that though but the
[1:02:21] interc court was what there was as
[1:02:23] brother Luis was talking about this
[1:02:24] morning there was the Sho bread there
[1:02:26] was a Candlestick table and shoe bread
[1:02:29] now remember those were all
[1:02:30] man-made manmade the candle man had to
[1:02:34] fill the candle with oil to keep it
[1:02:37] going man had to make the shoe bread
[1:02:40] right now this afternoon when we start
[1:02:43] talking about the holy of holies what's
[1:02:45] inside
[1:02:46] there the Ark of the Covenant that God
[1:02:49] wrote on the T on the tables of
[1:02:52] stone God created the Mana that's right
[1:02:56] that was put in there
[1:02:58] also and Aaron's old dirty Rod was put
[1:03:01] in there that was dead and and it budded
[1:03:04] under what the power of God so man
[1:03:07] didn't do that man could plant an almond
[1:03:09] tree sure enough he'd grow up and
[1:03:11] produce almonds but a stick that was
[1:03:13] dead that you laid it wasn't connected
[1:03:15] to the ground nowhere what am I saying
[1:03:17] man can get involved in sanctification
[1:03:20] man can get involved in justification
[1:03:23] but when you go into holy of holies it's
[1:03:24] God Almighty and and that's it nobody
[1:03:27] else but you and God
[1:03:30] alone so the shoe bread was made let's
[1:03:33] continue on now brother Luis was talking
[1:03:35] about the Tabernacle Candlestick table
[1:03:38] shoe bread now the after you go through
[1:03:40] the next Veil which is the golden sensor
[1:03:42] Ark of the
[1:03:43] Covenant and then the pot with Mana in
[1:03:46] it Aaron's rod and the tablets of the
[1:03:48] Covenant which are the Ten Commandments
[1:03:50] that we're inside that
[1:03:53] Ark now real quick just for a second
[1:03:56] Luke 24 behold I send the promise of my
[1:03:59] father upon you but te you in the city
[1:04:01] of Jerusalem until you be endued or sunk
[1:04:04] into that means sunk
[1:04:05] into with power from your
[1:04:09] brother power from the
[1:04:12] church no it says power from on high
[1:04:15] amen all right that power's got to come
[1:04:18] from somewhere besides Earthly power
[1:04:20] that's ain't that what the lady said a
[1:04:22] what the sister at the well said she
[1:04:23] said we worship in Jerusalem
[1:04:27] Jesus said there's going a time when you
[1:04:29] got to Worship in spirit and truth
[1:04:32] yes Mark 15 says Jesus cried with a loud
[1:04:35] voice and gave up The Ghost and the veil
[1:04:36] of the temple was rent from top to the
[1:04:40] bottom let me tell you something you
[1:04:42] guys were all temples if you got the new
[1:04:45] birth you are
[1:04:46] temples God's going to rip that Veil
[1:04:49] open so that man can see yes if you let
[1:04:53] God rip it open from Top
[1:04:56] to
[1:04:57] bottom come on somebody from top to
[1:05:00] bottom rip it open and let the world see
[1:05:03] what's going on inside that's what God
[1:05:05] wants now back then it was death to see
[1:05:09] that but now it's death not to be able
[1:05:12] to see that and and have a piece of that
[1:05:14] have a part of
[1:05:15] that we' read this before when the day
[1:05:18] of Pentecost was fully come now you know
[1:05:20] what Penta is Penta is five that's why
[1:05:23] the Pentagon is made in five sides
[1:05:26] Pentecost which was the Jubilee the 50th
[1:05:29] year the Jubilee now remember that
[1:05:32] hasn't been that hasn't been instituted
[1:05:35] it was in the Bible but the Jews never
[1:05:37] did it because remember the 50th Jubilee
[1:05:40] everything went free
[1:05:42] yes okay everybody with me there was a
[1:05:44] jubilee ever seven
[1:05:46] years but only certain things went free
[1:05:49] some had to stay something went free
[1:05:51] something had to stay you were
[1:05:53] enslaved oh come on somebody
[1:05:56] you were enslaved until that 50th
[1:05:59] Jubilee and then it didn't
[1:06:03] matter it didn't matter what man said it
[1:06:07] didn't matter what your owner
[1:06:10] said devil when that son comes up on
[1:06:12] that 50th Jubilee you're not mine I'm
[1:06:15] not yours anymore I'm going to be set
[1:06:17] free I'm God's now well that's what
[1:06:20] happened when you got born again you had
[1:06:23] a jubilee you had a Pentecost L you
[1:06:26] should have had a Revival inside of
[1:06:30] you cuz you got to go free everything
[1:06:33] went free you got all the blessings of
[1:06:35] God you never had to go back you threw
[1:06:38] those implements down and you went and
[1:06:39] did your thing God restored everything
[1:06:41] back to
[1:06:42] you God restore all of our children
[1:06:45] restore all of our parents anybody
[1:06:47] that's not serving the lord claim them
[1:06:50] it's your Jubilee the sun's
[1:06:53] up but the sun came up on the day of
[1:06:56] Pentecost right
[1:06:57] here they were all with one Accord in
[1:06:59] one place they weren't fighting and
[1:07:01] fussing suddenly there came a sound from
[1:07:03] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind that
[1:07:05] filled the house where they were sitting
[1:07:07] and there appear on them clothing
[1:07:08] tongues like a fire and it sat upon each
[1:07:10] of them and they were all filled with
[1:07:13] the Holy Ghost and began to speak with
[1:07:14] other tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:07:16] utterance now let me just make a few
[1:07:18] comments and then we'll close so now
[1:07:20] look there was no Messenger to the first
[1:07:23] outpouring of the Holy Spirit every by
[1:07:25] with me Peter was a spokesperson he
[1:07:28] stood up but remember
[1:07:32] Peter was not a
[1:07:37] prophet not a
[1:07:40] prophet they were waiting on
[1:07:43] one all right had to wait for a prophet
[1:07:46] to come on the scene then what did Paul
[1:07:48] do Paul took the Old Testament by
[1:07:51] Revelation he wrote the New Testament
[1:07:54] that we live by as Christians that's
[1:07:56] right all right now Peter wrote a couple
[1:07:58] of verses or a couple of chapters but
[1:08:00] not like Paul remember he even said Paul
[1:08:04] says things we can't understand why
[1:08:06] because Peter was a born- again believer
[1:08:08] he wrote a piece of the Bible but he
[1:08:10] wasn't a prophet right he wasn't the
[1:08:13] spokesperson for that age that was
[1:08:16] coming he was a spokesperson for the age
[1:08:19] of
[1:08:20] Pentecost because remember when the Holy
[1:08:23] Ghost fell on ad30 or 33
[1:08:27] it was like 20 something years before
[1:08:28] Paul received the Holy Ghost they had
[1:08:31] already had the Holy Ghost for all that
[1:08:32] time and then all of a sudden it struck
[1:08:33] Paul we know that
[1:08:36] watch so remember if Peter was a
[1:08:39] spokesman and that age was waiting on a
[1:08:43] prophet to come if that's the alpha
[1:08:45] bride the Omega bride has got to come
[1:08:48] the same way the Holy Ghost fell in
[1:08:51] 1906 uh Seymour and param were
[1:08:54] spokesperson
[1:08:56] but remember they were still
[1:08:58] reformers they were still trinitarians
[1:09:01] they were still believing in water
[1:09:03] baptism name father son Holy Ghost
[1:09:05] hello but what were they waiting on a
[1:09:08] prophet to
[1:09:10] come they had to wait till 1947 and
[1:09:13] brother randam comes on the scene all
[1:09:15] right everybody with
[1:09:17] me so you see each of these ages only
[1:09:20] took a dip in the Holy Spirit
[1:09:21] justification is a work sanctification
[1:09:23] is a work baptism is the Holy Spirit
[1:09:26] that's the reason it took a prophetic
[1:09:28] Prophet to come down no Messenger to the
[1:09:31] age all right so there was no Prophet no
[1:09:34] messenger there was no revealer of the
[1:09:36] word of
[1:09:38] God like God needed in Paul and brother
[1:09:43] brandham because the Holy Ghost came
[1:09:45] himself in the fullness of the baptism
[1:09:47] but at the end of the age as it always
[1:09:49] ends up so at the end of the Pentecostal
[1:09:51] age what happens brother brandham comes
[1:09:53] on the scene starts his message now 1947
[1:09:56] all
[1:09:57] right Peter and them they got the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost they have to wait Paul comes over
[1:10:01] and 20 something years later he gets the
[1:10:04] message he goes to the back side of the
[1:10:06] desert takes the Scrolls comes back and
[1:10:08] him and Peter are saying the same thing
[1:10:10] but Paul's got A plus Paul's a prophet
[1:10:13] he can go a little bit higher same way
[1:10:16] with all these brother R didn't deny the
[1:10:18] Holy Ghost in any of those
[1:10:20] people hello he just said you cabbage
[1:10:23] down on this you haven't went all the
[1:10:25] way way you haven't got all the fullness
[1:10:27] yet you say you latter rain people you
[1:10:29] ain't had a former Reign he was there in
[1:10:31] 47 to start the former Reign they
[1:10:33] already thought the Lord was coming in
[1:10:35] the latter rain that's how confused they
[1:10:37] were now listen God never is
[1:10:40] confused God never speaks something
[1:10:42] that's a lie right so Satan was lying to
[1:10:45] those people in their Revelation that
[1:10:48] those latter rain people were saying
[1:10:50] this is it there's no more
[1:10:53] right Satan's a lot more religious than
[1:10:55] you think he
[1:10:56] is but at the end of the age it always
[1:10:59] ends up we find the messenger sent now
[1:11:01] that's him brother brandham and all
[1:11:03] these Scruples and things are to be
[1:11:05] placed in their places what not
[1:11:06] reforming anymore
[1:11:08] restoring restoration what back to
[1:11:12] because we'll read in just a
[1:11:15] minute so now look the Alpha and Omega
[1:11:18] has to be bookends right everybody with
[1:11:20] me hey s bless you good to see you
[1:11:25] Paul was not at Pentecost everybody with
[1:11:28] me real quick Paul was not at Pentecost
[1:11:33] amen all
[1:11:36] right now but in 1 Corinthians
[1:11:41] 15:5 Paul is telling them who Jesus
[1:11:45] saw right I cut this short a little bit
[1:11:48] and that he was seen he was seen of
[1:11:50] sephus then of the 12 remember he was
[1:11:53] with the two on the Mass then he was
[1:11:55] revealed to the 12
[1:11:57] right and that he was seen of above 500
[1:12:01] Brethren at once I don't know where them
[1:12:03] other 380 went before Pentecost of them
[1:12:06] the greater part remain to this present
[1:12:08] but some are fallen asleep and this is
[1:12:10] Paul and after that he was seen of James
[1:12:13] then of all the apostles now watch and
[1:12:16] last of all he was seen of me
[1:12:19] also oh

[1:12:26] that word due time means an untimely
[1:12:30] birth what was Paul saying he said look
[1:12:32] I should have been in that Upper Room
[1:12:35] when the Holy Ghost fell I should have
[1:12:37] been
[1:12:38] there but I had an untimely birth I

[1:17:22] oh come on some he didn't start
[1:17:24] preaching a TR

[1:17:52] where even though we can be born again
