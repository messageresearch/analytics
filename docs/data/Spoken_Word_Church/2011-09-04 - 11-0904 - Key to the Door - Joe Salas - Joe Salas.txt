========================================

brother Bron preached different messages on door he said uh door and door I stand at the door knock uh door to the heart but uh what what I want to talk this morning about is uh the key to the door then I went up here was faith is the key and Jesus is the door s right like to talk to Sister GW upstairs let's go to uh Revelation 20 verse1 in the message said ke to the door brother said now in the Book of Revelation beginning with verse one I wish to read the 20th verse on the first first verse of the 20th chapter he said I saw an angel come down from heaven having a key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand he said now wish to speak if it would be if I could call it the text from this or draw a context from this text so that uh next 20 or 25 minutes I would like to call it the key to the door he said I do not wish to call it the keys because Peter was given the keys to the kingdom but I want to call it the key to the door he said now key notice here as we read that this angel came down from heaven having a key in his hand I believe it's Revelation 13 or 19 we find again another angel coming with a key and a key is a purpose of a key is to unlock something something that's been locked up or it's something that should be locked up but a key is given for that purpose now there are many kinds of keys because we have many US of keys there are keys to the storehouses there keys to your own house there's key to your automobile and we call them keys and they are keys and they can be duplicated many times or to the house there sometimes can be made what we call a skeleton key in other words it's a key that's kind of made with levels act on it that the twist the lock in a certain way and can almost unlock any door called a skeleton key it's a skeleton frame of many keys and they can be unlocked that way with our houses or even to our Auto automobiles can be duplicated any key cannot unlock no door unless it's used by hand it's got to have something to use the key the key in itself cannot use itself it's got to have something to yield men carry a few keys and women carry my keys somebody told me that a lot of women carry a lot of keys and puts a strain on your ignition I don't know if it's true or not asking sometimes they have to change that ignition itself because the way the technology is sh g roll may have SE for here lotions and hand sanitizer and all that stuff he when you asked me to borrow my keys I didn't know you were going to bash let's go to Daniel 124 Daniel 12 or four 12 12 go chapter the fourth verse it says uh thou Daniel shut up the works and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fr and knowledge shall increase you buy a electronic uh piece of equipment or something uh next week it might be up to leave they come out with something better Bea was sh me that U iPad I pretty neat you know you can write your little notes on there whatever you know up oh sorry now for your home they have that technology that you can uh open your door with the hardw work is still still in that and the you punch his numbers on your door and opens your door M or some building you can just scan a little part it open your door right and uh and your cars with this little clicker you can do a lot of stuff you can open your doors this open my windows my trunk and the new cars I don't have a new car that Esther has she can start a car from a this one and uh even brother Brandon talks about this car going down the road and that nobody's driving at the people are back playing some kind of game or something but I think I'm not sure I think they have to have the sensors or something to put on the road to make it oll I guess I got an article it says uh a California company Tuesday will announce an iPhone application and car receiver that will enable users to lock and unlock and remotely start to car with the phone rather than with the car car keys the Viper Smart Start is the latest example of automatic technology El Electronics functions migrating into Apple iPhone and other smartphones including turn by turn directions or located in the closest gas station says such ideas are Challen are a challenge for automakers aftermarket suppliers to for whom advanced auto electronics been highly profitable the Smart Start remote start and locked up lets the owner be really remote like Mike Simmons Executive Vice President of direct Electronics the parent at the maker has demonstrated starting his car using an eyeb bone starting his car in California using iPhone in Kansas City now I I don't know if how long it keeps it uh I guess brother Bo could have used this system last week and we all can once in all cuz we keep locking our keys but I try to have extra keys on my car somewhere because even I did it Monday I like the keys on the truck but I always keep an extra keys so he said what is a Smart Start GPS smart star GPS a combination of new hardware and update that works with the DM bunch of numbers is a brand new generation Smart Start modular with GPS built-in the new V2 Viper Smart Start includes a simple to use interactive manner for setting up GPS alerts to protect your vehicles and family like never before it's got a vehicle locator press the button on your smartphone and receive vehicle's current location plus speed if it's moving for the teenagers speed alert

so it will be alerted if your vehicle goes there scheduling time frames and curfews for notifications the message ke to the said uh now key is the same thing pardon me the key is only to be held in a hand that unlocks the door see it's got to be hand and hand now and in the key I'm going to speak about tonight it's only one hand can hold this key and that's the the hand of Faith it's the only thing can hold this key and hand whole other keys and he takes a hand I paid for that the same message now there is such an evil as polio M Small Co yellow Beaver p l so forth the sign this evils has been able to fly day and night till they found inoculation from it because it's evil it's a killer how much more is there a key to Salvation for a man that's imprison House of sin there's a key to that door to liberate men from it a key used usually when you turn the lock and when you find a key it's got to be some treasure something that's worthwhile or you want to even lock it up if it ain't worth locking it up just let it go but when it's worth locking it up so key usually is a note to something or the way to enter to something that's worthwhile the key that's what's it for now it unlocks something that's worth well let's go to St John 10 John 10 starting at uh start at 7 s verse then Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever come before me are thevs and rubbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man Enter he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I'm the good Shepherd the Good Shepherd give his life for the sheep and he did at the cross but he that is in Harland and not the shepherd who's own the sheep or not see if the wolf cometh and leaveth the sheep and flee and the Wolf catch them and scare the Sheep the harling flee because he is a harling and care not for the Sheep said I am the good Shepherd and know my sheep I am known of mine as the father knowe me even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep brother brother boy talks about when he goes to camp he lays at the close to the door so them kids don't get out at night so he's kind of like playing that the Good Shepherd at the door Jesus said I the door to sheep I'm the door not a door the door the only door on the on the way the only way the truth and life and no man cometh unto the father but by me I'm the door to the che and all that come before me is enemies theves and R he's the door to sheeple he is the door to Salvation there's not another name given under heaven where you must be saved only through the name of Jesus Christ no church no denomination no Creed no doctrines of anything only through Jesus name that is that is the key no wonder Peter could use one of them on the key they a Pentecost they wanted to know how to get into the door he used the the key and there's only only one key because there's just one door I am the door and Peter had that key to it and he said repent every one of you and be be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the commission of your sins and you shall receive the treasures of God it's the key to the door and Jesus is the door there's only one door to healing and Jesus is that door there's only one door to peace yeah my peace I give unto you he's only one he's the only Lord to jine peace you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home might accumulate no money to get your children cloes have food to eat but you might have accumulated enough populated to be popular amongst the people but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace and that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one one peace and that's Jesus is the peace peace are peace he our healing I'm the Lord Our God and heals all our diseases he is the door to heaven and there's no other or no other way but through Jesus Christ he is the door to heaven and now Jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key and unlocks the door now if Jesus is the door to all this Promises of God they and has finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of God see he is Faith is the key that unlocks every promise he makes the key of Faith does that faith and his finished work is this keys that were were speaking on now in Hebrews 11 chapter I got a great string of themer rald down here of these Heroes of fa it was the key to the door that stuffed them mou the Lions it was the key of faith that unlocked the prison houses he was Faith the key of faith that quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword but the dead back to life again it was Faith the key of faith in the living of God that had that man that woman who can take the key of faith that can unlock every promise God made but if you haven't got that key you're just you you'll never unlock it you'll be against it because this key any correct make key have levs on the inside of lock that they take a certain form certain shape of anti to turn this level and just one little level out of the way will mess the whole thing up you know a key that locks unlocks too see me can't lose her V that's right the same key that locks unlocks the key that unlocks and lock up and that's exactly see because it works both ways how pitiful it is that church has lost his vision of that What a Sad thing it was when the church sold the sell out to Creed as we've done today and now called to unite see the key Vision the word of the Lord there's nothing can change it or stop it what the church needs tonight is not an education what the church needs tonight is not a denomination what the church needs tonight is not a greed what the church needs tonight is a key to the scripture the door which Christ is the door and he is the work faith and the work of the Living God out of let's go to Matthew uh 7 78 said ask and it shall be given seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you for everyone that ask it receive it and he that seek it find it and he and through him that knock it shall be open the key is ask ask is the key just like brother talks about sister uh hary right that she said the right thing he said uh he said God just told me that you could ask for anything that you wanted but she asked for the Salvation of the two boys he said he would ask for a million God been obligated let's go to Psalms uh 8410 David said for day that course is better than thousand I rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tense wickedness let's go to 1 Chronicles 15:23 now David wasn't just talking about being a a a doorkeeper cuz they there is doorkeepers to the ark and uh one place in Second Kings I talked about three ladke Keepers right here talks about two uh 1 Chronicles 1523 I don't know why they make these Nam so hard to pronounce and bar CH and El were doorkeepers for the ark this go to Matthew uh 3134 25 25 sorry 25 25 31 and 34 it says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels of him and then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gather all nations he shall separate them from one another as a Shepherd divides his sheep his sheep from his goats and he shall set the Sheep on the right his right hand but the goat on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed are my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so we have to we have to make sure we are cheap not goats or something else amen thank you thank you
