[0:03] John
[0:06] three
[0:08] now for those of you
[0:11] that
[0:13] are coming back or been out sick we've
[0:15] got plenty out sick today 20 or so of us
[0:18] out
[0:20] sick brother Dale sick at home and that
[0:23] he's sick at home he's not feeling good
[0:27] so let's just keep him in prayers got a
[0:30] grade fever said he may try to make it
[0:32] this afternoon which I figure he will
[0:34] unless Mama puts a rope around him and
[0:35] makes him not
[0:38] come but we got to quit passing it
[0:40] around everybody's you know passing it
[0:43] around each other but I'm just denied it
[0:46] in the name of the Lord and I don't want
[0:47] it so I don't want it I know sometimes
[0:51] your body has to get rid of these things
[0:52] and that's okay but mine's purging just
[0:57] fine not a problem with that John 3 and
[1:01] what we're going to do is is we're going
[1:04] to call this series a basis of
[1:08] Christianity basis of
[1:10] Christianity
[1:12] um and I don't want to make it to where
[1:14] you think it's aart from the message of
[1:17] the
[1:18] hour but there's a lot of people get can
[1:20] get born again without the
[1:23] message there's going to be Untold
[1:25] millions of people in heaven that's
[1:27] never heard of William Brown right
[1:28] that's going to be a just like me and
[1:30] you Luther
[1:32] Wesley irenius Paul all those Church A's
[1:36] Messengers never heard of William Brown
[1:37] I'm never heard of the message of the
[1:39] hour they had their message of the hour
[1:42] this is the apex of the message of the
[1:44] hour but if we don't get born again
[1:47] we're not going to understand this
[1:48] message you're just going to sit here
[1:49] and you're just going to get a head
[1:51] knowledge when I was 14 years old I was
[1:53] not born again and I can understand the
[1:56] message I understood servant seed I
[1:57] understood things like one God
[2:00] and I could see it and I could read The
[2:03] Prophet's message but I wasn't born
[2:04] again so let's just not let it be
[2:06] something where it's just a reading room
[2:08] where we just over in the message and we
[2:10] believe that William Brandon was a
[2:12] prophet and that's it no Christianity
[2:16] has been around a lot longer than
[2:17] William brandham has been
[2:19] around Christianity is based on Jesus
[2:22] Christ not William brandham right but
[2:25] now
[2:25] without the
[2:27] message you will not fully understand
[2:30] Jesus Christ okay so we're not doing
[2:32] away right but we do have to get a
[2:36] brother brand said we got to get Faith
[2:38] there at the bottom of the pyramid we
[2:39] got to get the new birth first then the
[2:42] Bible says these things will be added to
[2:44] you and I believe that if you are born
[2:47] again you will come to the message of
[2:49] the hour because that is the token in
[2:51] the end time that's right all right A
[2:53] lot of people think that brother R
[2:55] changed his his way of of of preaching
[2:58] salvation that it's just believe the
[3:00] message well the devil believes the
[3:01] message he was right there at every
[3:03] service
[3:05] right but what about the revelation of
[3:08] the message right cuz the Bible tells
[3:11] you the letter kth right the letter
[3:14] kth but the spirit giveth life and it's
[3:16] not what in remember over in Revelations
[3:20] 1 through3 it says what the spirit says
[3:23] to the churches not what the man says
[3:25] what the spirit says to the churches all
[3:27] right so you've got and this is what you
[3:29] got to
[3:30] do if you're a born again Christian you
[3:33] have to
[3:35] somewhere come to the message of the
[3:37] hour and receive that revelation of the
[3:40] message of the hour and then that can be
[3:41] quickened to you right other than that
[3:44] it's just sitting in a Pew and listening
[3:45] into a good preacher and get all this
[3:47] head knowledge I don't want head
[3:51] knowledge Bible says knowledge puff it
[3:54] up right and that's what happens to a
[3:56] lot of to a lot of people we see that
[3:58] now are falling away from the the
[3:59] message goes there they they don't
[4:02] understand
[4:02] it well I thought the Holy Ghost said he
[4:06] was going to be the one that comes and
[4:08] reveals it to you and what Jesus said
[4:10] I'll come back yes and come not with you
[4:13] but in
[4:14] you right be your guide and show you
[4:18] things to come all right now that's a
[4:19] promise of the Holy Ghost so he'll show
[4:22] you a revelation if you'll just ask him
[4:28] go in the right order because let's read
[4:30] chapter 3 we're probably going to wear
[4:32] this out but we're going to read
[4:35] it there was a man of the Pharisees
[4:37] named Nicodemus now
[4:39] Nicodemus was a good what we would call
[4:43] good Christian man right he was he was
[4:46] right up there with the best of the best
[4:50] but yet he could not understand what
[4:52] Jesus was talking about cuz he say he
[4:54] must be born again all right so now
[4:57] let's read There was a man of the
[4:59] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[5:02] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[5:05] said unto him Rabbi we know we know so
[5:08] he's discussed it with somebody he
[5:10] didn't say I know he says we know we
[5:14] know that thou art a teacher come from
[5:18] God okay so that part was made known to
[5:22] him because they couldn't deny the signs
[5:24] and the Wonders they couldn't deny that
[5:27] he had a Ministry but you're going to
[5:30] find out in a few seconds he didn't
[5:32] understand nothing Jesus was talking
[5:35] about yet he knew he was a great teacher
[5:38] right yet he knew he had something that
[5:40] come from God what he says right here he
[5:43] come from God we know that thou are a
[5:44] teacher come from God for no man can do
[5:47] these Miracles that thou doest except
[5:49] God be with him Jesus answered and said
[5:51] unto him verely verely or listen listen
[5:54] I say to thee except a man be born
[5:58] again
[6:00] he cannot see the kingdom of God that
[6:03] word see is not see with your eyes that
[6:07] word see is understand if a preacher
[6:10] says do you see what I'm
[6:12] saying that doesn't mean do you
[6:14] physically see what I'm saying that's
[6:17] right he's saying do you understand what
[6:19] I'm saying right see means to understand
[6:22] and Nicodemus did not understand what
[6:24] Jesus was talking about because of his
[6:26] next comment Nicodemus said unto him
[6:31] how can a man be born when he's
[6:33] old natural carnal conception of the
[6:38] word how can a man be born again when
[6:41] he's
[6:43] old can he enter the second time into
[6:45] his mother's womb and be born now we're
[6:48] talking about a teacher we're talking
[6:50] about a teacher that was right under Gia
[6:53] CIA was the highest and he was like
[6:55] second in
[6:57] command he was the Grown gr man probably
[7:00] in his 40s or 50s
[7:02] maybe and he missed totally what Jesus
[7:05] was talking
[7:06] about because Jesus answered barely
[7:09] barely or listen listen I say unto thee
[7:12] except a man be born of water and of
[7:16] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[7:18] of
[7:19] God that which is born of the flesh is
[7:21] flesh and that which is born of the
[7:23] spirit is spirit so he's dividing that
[7:25] which is born of the flesh is flesh
[7:27] Nicodemus you're talking about flesh
[7:30] right can I go do I need to go back into
[7:33] my mother's womb something natural all
[7:35] right but thus the born of the spirit is
[7:37] of the spirit okay
[7:40] so we see here that Jesus is still look
[7:44] at verse 7 Marvel
[7:46] not Marvel not he must have looked at
[7:50] Nicodemus and Nicodemus was
[7:54] going cuz he said Marvel
[7:57] not I try to put
[8:00] myself standing there and watching these
[8:03] two Converse like a TV screen like a
[8:06] vision and watch these two men one a
[8:09] great teacher of Israel and one Jesus
[8:12] Christ standing there and he's the very
[8:14] eternal life the word of God and then
[8:16] here walks Nicodemus up void of now he
[8:20] has the word of God in letter but he's
[8:22] void of the spirit of
[8:24] God right right all right now he he'll
[8:27] be given eternal life I believe around
[8:29] said he would for his stand and that's
[8:31] okay but he was never a born again
[8:33] believer so he never really understood
[8:35] what Jesus was talking about neither did
[8:38] the
[8:39] disciples until the day of Pentecost
[8:43] right right they didn't understand what
[8:44] he was saying oh sure there was a few
[8:46] things that when he would explain a
[8:48] parable they go oh well see that's the
[8:51] letter and guess who was in that group
[8:54] The Devil Judas was right there in that
[8:58] group and we were talking about
[8:59] yesterday in ministers meeting well
[9:02] downstairs it wasn't part of the
[9:03] minister
[9:04] meeting well it was last night when we
[9:06] were talking to Faith and him at at the
[9:08] motel our persecution is going to come
[9:11] from
[9:12] within not from outside right because
[9:15] those 12 were sitting around Jesus that
[9:17] night Jesus told them exactly except
[9:20] pointing at him he said the one that
[9:22] Sops in the bowl with me is going to
[9:24] deny me and there was Judas right here
[9:27] is it me Lord all those other 11 did not
[9:32] know cuz remember Jesus said go do what
[9:35] you got to do brother said explaining
[9:37] that and he said they thought he was
[9:38] just going to go pay for the cuz he held
[9:40] the money he was just going to go pay
[9:41] for the food that that AE like there'd
[9:43] be 12 of us here and I'd slip out and go
[9:45] pay the meal and come
[9:47] back well there he
[9:49] was the Devil Himself right son of
[9:53] predition he was sitting there among
[9:56] those 12 but they didn't have the spirit
[9:59] they didn't have the Holy Spirit Jesus
[10:01] knew who he was he said I knew you from
[10:02] the beginning right okay so he knew when
[10:04] he picked it he picked up on his Spirit
[10:06] but see they weren't spiritual enough to
[10:08] pick up on the spirit so they just
[10:10] thought he was going out to pay the you
[10:12] know pay for the food well see they were
[10:14] deceived and there was Jesus the only
[10:16] one that knew what was going on and
[10:19] honestly honestly I don't think Judas
[10:22] knew what he was
[10:24] doing until he did
[10:26] it because when he went down there and
[10:29] they told him what they were going to do
[10:30] to Jesus remember he throwed the money
[10:33] down and the Bible said he went hung
[10:37] himself right cuz that was
[10:41] when and I believe like me and brother
[10:43] Tim was talking about last night Judas
[10:45] wasn't going to the Pharisees to turn
[10:48] Jesus in for something he did wrong
[10:50] that's
[10:51] right I believe what he's doing is like
[10:53] a lot of people nowadays you can take
[10:56] this with a grain of salt or or or
[10:58] whatever that are wanting to go past
[11:01] this
[11:02] message you know past this
[11:05] message and another person's coming or
[11:08] brother Ram's got to come
[11:10] back that's going past the message cuz
[11:12] he said Rapture in faith lays in the
[11:13] books and tapes not in
[11:15] him rting Faith lays in the books and
[11:17] tapes not in William Brown that's right
[11:19] he's dead that's right Moses thy servant
[11:22] is gone he's dead in the body he's dead
[11:25] now we know he's in the sixth Dimension
[11:26] but you know who he's waiting on me and
[11:28] you that's right
[11:30] but
[11:32] Judas when he did what he
[11:35] did I believe he was going he was
[11:38] telling Jesus let's get on with it if
[11:40] you are who you say you are yes see
[11:42] that's what the people are going to do
[11:43] in the message they're going to say hey
[11:45] if you cuz remember brother R said when
[11:48] the bride begins to say I and my father
[11:50] are one the shu's going to pull away
[11:53] right okay because they're
[11:56] religious not born again
[12:00] we're here Born Again of the spirit of
[12:03] God this is a different Spirit than this
[12:07] that's right but we're in the same ranks
[12:10] that's right and this one is going to
[12:12] say if you be who you are let's get on
[12:15] with it well see that's so close and
[12:18] that is blaspheming because that is
[12:20] contributing the act of God to the devil
[12:23] which they're wanting they're wanting
[12:25] see everybody's wanting signs and
[12:26] wonders back to where brother Brown was
[12:29] that was not
[12:30] promised that was promised to
[12:33] him it was not promised to us to have a
[12:36] on man campaign like Willam Bram had
[12:39] that's done that's finished he did that
[12:42] he said that was the bait on the hook to
[12:44] draw them to the
[12:45] message okay to draw them to the message
[12:47] of the hour all right not to uh reform
[12:51] them that's what the problem with Judas
[12:54] was
[12:55] reformed Judas was brought into a
[12:58] religious dis order and
[13:01] reform but Reformation is not
[13:03] restoration that's right he was just
[13:05] reformed that's Alcoholic Anonymous once
[13:07] an alcoholic always an alcoholic that's
[13:09] what they teach you well you can reform
[13:11] from that you can say I'm not going to
[13:14] drink anymore and they teach you how to
[13:16] take this outside man and keep him in
[13:18] control right you know what they do
[13:20] that's right but once you get born again
[13:22] see once born again never an alcoholic
[13:25] again never there's no temptation
[13:27] there's no you can walk by a beer joint
[13:29] and not want to go in it right but they
[13:32] tell you an alcoholic is anonymous just
[13:33] don't go down to the Beer Joint don't
[13:35] get around somebody that drinks don't do
[13:36] this don't do that just do and don'ts
[13:38] but when you get born again and you get
[13:40] a different nature and that's what we're
[13:42] probably not going to get into today but
[13:44] a different
[13:46] nature that nature never wants to drink
[13:48] that's
[13:49] right so you've not been reformed you've
[13:52] been restored but we've got a lot of and
[13:55] I say us have got a lot of reforming
[13:58] that's right
[13:59] where we need some re restoring all
[14:02] right back to the original Faith where
[14:04] it's not going to be where brother R
[14:06] said it's not going to be empty in
[14:07] hospitals it's not going to be like
[14:09] popcorn popping that's right I thought
[14:12] the Bible said it'd be a secret brother
[14:14] R said we'll be gone and nobody ever
[14:15] know
[14:17] it so if we're gone and nobody ever
[14:20] knows it we're not going to make a whole
[14:21] lot of noise right right right now God's
[14:25] going to be so indwelling in me that I
[14:27] believe if I need something he said the
[14:28] third pole lays dormant he said but it
[14:31] will be put in use when it's needed
[14:33] that's right okay that's pretty much a
[14:34] direct quote when it's needed when we
[14:37] The Squeeze comes and if we need a pork
[14:39] chop to eat God will give us a pork chop
[14:41] right God will give us a drink of water
[14:43] that's right he's not going to give us
[14:44] Diet Mountain Dew he's going to give us
[14:47] water of course I would pray that I get
[14:49] a d Mountain Dew CU I like Mountain but
[14:52] he gives us what we need what not what
[14:54] we want that's yeah he gives us what we
[14:56] need not what we want
[15:00] but we've come to this place though to
[15:02] where I want us to see and be able
[15:04] because here is and I didn't bring this
[15:06] quote but I'll bring it next
[15:08] Sunday brother Brown says when we can
[15:10] realize the two spirits in the framework
[15:12] of the
[15:13] church I say in the framework of the
[15:15] message Church okay let's don't to put
[15:18] it out there let's put it right here
[15:20] okay cuz realize one thing if if they
[15:23] have a father son Holy Ghost baptism
[15:26] they're already FAL right they're
[15:29] already FAL God's already moved on from
[15:32] that he wined into ignorance before now
[15:34] he requires us to be baptized in the
[15:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a
[15:39] requirement in the end time because he
[15:41] God moved and winked at the ignorance of
[15:43] Luther and Wesley and down Through the
[15:44] Ages and even Pentecost even people like
[15:47] FF Bosworth and people like that great
[15:49] faith
[15:51] healers but really never caught on to
[15:53] the message right you know and I put
[15:55] that in quotations because the message
[15:57] of the hour
[15:59] is Jesus
[16:01] Christ that's right
[16:03] period it's Jesus Christ cuz brother
[16:05] Brandon brought us nothing but Jesus
[16:07] Christ he never pointed us to a man he
[16:09] never pointed us to himself he pointed
[16:10] us to Jesus Christ I think people tend
[16:14] to they don't see Jesus today in the
[16:16] flesh we don't even sometimes realize
[16:19] who we are right you know and and they
[16:22] don't see they see Jesus in the past my
[16:25] mind goes back right to when the bride
[16:28] realizes who she is and what she's doing
[16:29] here she'll be an invincible Army that
[16:31] brings it right up to here okay sure it
[16:34] was Jesus back
[16:36] there but what about now if we're the
[16:39] last IM morphe of God if we're the last
[16:42] form that God will ever take then
[16:43] there's no other God but us that's
[16:46] strong that's strong hard to swallow but
[16:50] brother Brown said when you say I am my
[16:51] father a one well you know what we're
[16:53] doing we're doing just like Jesus when
[16:55] Jesus walked up to those Pharisees he
[16:57] said I am my father are one and you're
[16:59] of your father the devil right he didn't
[17:02] playay he didn't play no words they
[17:04] thought I was strong yesterday at the
[17:06] ministers meeting and I said I've never
[17:08] got up and called people Hypocrites
[17:10] before Snakes in the Grass Jesus did he
[17:12] said in other words he was pointing at
[17:14] the congregation he said your daddy's
[17:16] different than mine that's right and
[17:18] mine's of God and yours is of the devil
[17:22] uh hadn't seen that yet in the sanctuary
[17:24] but U you never know may come sometime
[17:29] but where we're
[17:31] failing and I'm going to read out of the
[17:33] adoption series and we'll finish reading
[17:34] this I'm going to stop right there
[17:35] because in verse 7 it says Marvel
[17:38] not that I said unto thee you must be
[17:41] born
[17:42] again brother brand in adoption series
[17:47] 1960 5:15 I'm going to run these off cuz
[17:50] I I'm I'm going to do a little packet so
[17:53] you can read it for yourself and there's
[17:55] where the church is failing today on
[17:58] that wall walk do you know that even
[18:00] your own behavior can knock somebody
[18:02] else out of getting
[18:04] healed your misbehavior of unconfessed
[18:07] Sins Of You
[18:10] Believers can cause this church to
[18:14] bitterly
[18:15] fail and at the day of judgment you'll
[18:18] be responsible for every bit of
[18:21] it oh you say now wait a minute brother
[18:23] Bram well that's the
[18:25] truth so he tells the truth that's truth
[18:29] and there's where the church is filing
[18:30] today on that walk not on the seals and
[18:33] the plagues and the vials and the church
[18:34] ages and the and the son of man Min no
[18:37] it's on walk our daily walk that's right
[18:40] there was a question brought up
[18:42] yesterday about the Bible says that the
[18:45] Jews will see the nail prints in Jesus's
[18:47] hand remember they said where'd you get
[18:48] those scars and sit in the house of my
[18:50] friends well somebody was asking well he
[18:52] literally come back and they see the
[18:54] nail prints brother Bram said his feet
[18:56] doesn't hit the earth in his literal
[18:57] Corporal body until the Millennium
[18:59] starts so it has to be those two
[19:01] prophets preaching Christ so much
[19:04] because I want to ask you a question and
[19:05] that's what I posed to the ministers up
[19:07] front yesterday how many of you seen the
[19:09] nail
[19:10] scar how many of you have seen the nail
[19:13] prints in Jesus's hand literally you've
[19:16] never seen it but by Revelation it's so
[19:20] real that's right and I was telling them
[19:22] before Bob's already heard this you know
[19:24] I mean you you take somebody and you say
[19:26] well I see the nail prints in his hands
[19:29] well if your Christ made manifest in
[19:31] another form they should see the they
[19:33] that's right that's good in
[19:36] your they should see your suffering the
[19:39] nail prints the scars that you took he
[19:43] took them all for us right that's right
[19:45] but we're down here in flesh doing the
[19:47] same thing we're taking the brunt of
[19:50] this L of sin
[19:52] age worst age there ever was that's
[19:56] right on the face of the Earth this is
[19:58] the worst a for a Christian to live a
[20:00] Christian Life that's right but he said
[20:02] you can do it that's right so where'd
[20:04] you get those scars in the house of my
[20:08] friends the world we all got scars right
[20:12] we all got scars with past life but
[20:16] that's what Jesus was telling Nicodemus
[20:18] though if you're born again you're born
[20:20] of the spirit not of the
[20:22] flesh so we don't have to be so
[20:24] spiritually minded we're no Heavenly
[20:26] good I mean we're no earthly good we
[20:27] don't have walk around with our you know
[20:29] head in the clouds and and and you know
[20:32] never have a bad thought and just walk
[20:34] around like this you know that's just
[20:35] doing Penance like the Catholic Church
[20:37] they're trying the Catholic church is
[20:39] really trying brother Bob they are
[20:42] trying but they're trying through
[20:44] penants and they're trying through
[20:45] beating the Flesh and you
[20:48] know that's not where it's at they got
[20:51] to start with the inside guy and work
[20:52] the way out all right same way with here
[20:56] where is the church failing on that walk
[20:59] now I want you to listen to this we're
[21:00] going to finish right here and I want
[21:01] you to ponder this in your heart brother
[21:03] bandam was in that prayer
[21:06] line Faith Africa trip report 1952
[21:10] Battle Creek
[21:12] Michigan said look lady death knocks at
[21:16] your door he's got a lady standing in
[21:17] front of him you believe me to be his
[21:20] Prophet if you'll just listen to God and
[21:23] God will return to you the lady says now
[21:27] I got a question question to ask you and
[21:29] she must whisper brother said yes the
[21:31] lady speaks to brother rown whisper that
[21:33] is true
[21:34] lady what I what I mean is true you
[21:37] listen to what
[21:40] backsliding don't mean didn't don't mean
[21:43] that you've gone somewhere and with a
[21:46] man I'm a little bit of a calvinist see
[21:50] not that radical type but I'm calvinist
[21:54] you was born
[21:56] again but you back slid away from your
[21:59] calling from
[22:00] God is that right and you should have
[22:03] went and done something but you felt
[22:06] like you wasn't able to do
[22:09] it that's right and he goes on and I
[22:12] believe the lady gets her healing but
[22:14] she had to confess something to him and
[22:16] he said I think she might have probably
[22:18] said well I don't believe I'm born again
[22:20] or or I may have done something he said
[22:23] cuz he could feel that Spirit remember
[22:24] the person would walk up he said you
[22:26] have a welcome spirit I see that you're
[22:27] born again I see that you're a Christian
[22:29] cuz the spirits were compared with each
[22:30] other so he must have with this one cuz
[22:32] he said you was born again but you back
[22:35] slid away from your calling from
[22:38] god so let's don't count everybody
[22:41] out um the prodical
[22:43] son everybody thinks the prodical son is
[22:46] somebody that goes out in their
[22:48] Center and they come back to their
[22:52] daddy he was a son when he left right he
[22:57] was part of the family when he went
[23:00] out did things
[23:03] wrong but to show he was a son he came
[23:07] back right remember he got down to the
[23:09] lowest part now there's a fine line and
[23:12] this is what I want you to think about
[23:13] next week for next
[23:15] week my point
[23:19] is when you go out and do I know for a
[23:22] fact when I was 14 years old and when I
[23:24] got up to 17 18 years old when I went
[23:26] out in the world and left home I wasn't
[23:28] born again I knew
[23:29] that but I had the word planted in my
[23:32] heart because I because remember the
[23:34] Bible says train up a child in the way
[23:36] should go and when he's
[23:38] older he won't depart now I wasn't born
[23:41] again go out there doing the things I
[23:43] did right that's the characteristic I
[23:45] want us to start looking at that's right
[23:48] okay but now to backslide brother R we
[23:50] backslide every day right every day we
[23:52] backslide right okay so we backslide
[23:55] every day in other words he said you see
[23:56] what he said you be he said you backslid
[23:59] from your calling from God if you got a
[24:02] calling from God and you don't do that
[24:03] calling you
[24:06] backslid okay brother Bram said the Holy
[24:09] Ghost to go out on the
[24:10] limb and wait on you to call him back
[24:14] right now the Holy Ghost didn't come out
[24:16] of your body and go over there and set
[24:18] on a lamb and he's illustrating that
[24:20] there's something between you and God
[24:23] that you put a wall up you're still born
[24:26] again but you're not letting God your
[24:30] back slid away from your calling from
[24:32] God
[24:33] that's okay find your calling the Bible
[24:36] says make your make your calling and
[24:38] election sure uh if you're going to be a
[24:40] housewife be the best one you can be if
[24:43] you're going to be this or that it be
[24:44] the best one you can be okay I'm going
[24:46] to read one more quote and then we're
[24:47] going to leave God's way that's been
[24:49] made for us 1952 these are way back in
[24:52] the 50s when he was trying to get people
[24:54] born again he was trying to get people
[24:56] to where they could see Jesus Christ not
[24:58] William brandom okay excuse me I
[25:03] followed up another man here not long
[25:04] ago for they talk about a lot of this
[25:06] said he went to one city had 5,000
[25:09] conversions we followed right behind it
[25:11] not me but a group of ministers and took
[25:13] the cards and followed them back and in
[25:14] 30 days they couldn't find 30 that
[25:17] claimed to be saved you know what I
[25:19] think I think it's
[25:22] conviction instead of
[25:26] conversion when a man is Born Again of
[25:28] the spirit of God what we need today is
[25:30] not a ProTrac of
[25:32] meeting but an oldfashioned God sent
[25:35] Holy Ghost Revival an oldtime sky blue
[25:38] sin killing blood washing
[25:41] religion makes you take them somebody
[25:43] must have stole a tire tool cuz he said
[25:45] make sure you take them tire tools back
[25:46] and do
[25:47] repentance please said make sure you
[25:50] take that tire tool back and
[25:53] repent brother Joe you take a tire to Oh
[25:56] I thought he's raising his hand
[25:58] says that sometimes we don't mean it but
[26:00] sometimes we act like Christians sure
[26:04] sure but it's just like the peacock and
[26:06] the Buzzard the Buzzard can throw all
[26:09] the peacock feathers any he wants but
[26:11] he's still a buzzard or a
[26:15] crow
[26:18] thought what thought what you wanted us
[26:21] to think about you had a question but
[26:22] you know I want you to think about that
[26:24] the where you backslid away from your
[26:26] calling from God I want you to think
[26:28] about your Christian Life and the way
[26:31] you've lived
[26:33] because the way I see it and I see it in
[26:35] churches this one and others the Bible
[26:38] says the more as a day approach we
[26:40] should be in church the more as a day
[26:42] approach we should be in fellowship with
[26:43] God the more is a day approach we should
[26:45] be praying more the more is a day
[26:46] approach we should be doing this it
[26:48] seems like everybody's going in reverse
[26:49] so do not tell me you're progressing in
[26:52] God you're
[26:56] not can we read Bible forsake not
[26:59] assembling yourself together we got
[27:01] people come morning service don't come
[27:02] back second service we got people that
[27:04] lay out for this lay out for
[27:06] that my question is are you going to
[27:09] church more now than you did 6 months
[27:12] ago a year
[27:13] ago and it ain't all going to church but
[27:16] it does this the Bible says for sake not
[27:18] assembling himself together and much
[27:20] more as the day
[27:22] approaches so if you're not then you
[27:24] back s from your
[27:26] calling
[27:28] sorry being sick's different laying out
[27:32] different but Jesus said you must be
[27:34] born again to be born again you got to
[27:36] have the same desire and now was
[27:38] thinking about this standing outside
[27:40] this morning getting ready to come to
[27:41] church does the Holy Ghost want to go to
[27:45] church so if you don't want to
[27:51] go don't think of
[27:54] that but seven days a week oh Lord
[27:57] that's correct churches seven days a
[27:59] week all year that's a communion with
[28:00] God that's right
[28:02] and
[28:05] you at home that's right in your car
[28:08] walking I justify for the fact that my
[28:12] life with God is greater than it ever
[28:14] been and because I have church all the
[28:18] all the that's right when
[28:21] I'm right but I'm in the bathroom I have
[28:23] church right and that's how you that's
[28:25] what you got to do you got to see that
[28:28] okay so but it says forsake not the
[28:30] assembling of yourself together I know
[28:33] you're not contradicting that but but
[28:34] she's right we should have church seven
[28:36] days a week but the Bible says for
[28:38] forsake not the there must be something
[28:40] we've got to do when we assemble that's
[28:42] right except just come here and eat
[28:43] lunch and wait till the preacher gets
[28:45] done preaching and then have lunch and
[28:46] or have breakfast and then wait till the
[28:48] preacher gets done preaching then have
[28:49] lunch and then let the preacher get done
[28:51] preaching then we go get something to
[28:52] eat that's right I mean is that just a
[28:54] social event is that just something we
[28:56] put into a social event
[28:58] uh what I want to do is is I want to be
[29:00] to where we're all prayed up we're
[29:04] all in the mind of God when we get here
[29:09] that's right not wait till we get here
[29:11] and then try to get in the mind of God
[29:13] that's and then say brother they don't
[29:16] take care of all my woes and all my
[29:18] praying for me and my children Bo W you
[29:21] w you will brother Dale take care of my
[29:24] kids no it's not brother Dale's it's not
[29:27] his part to take care of your kids it's
[29:29] your part you had them like Dy said you
[29:32] had fun making them you ought to have
[29:33] fun raising
[29:37] them
[29:40] Hallelujah yes the then then then God
[29:44] can talk to us instead of having to deal
[29:45] with all of our little woes that we have
[29:47] all during the week okay really honestly
[29:52] if nobody gets it but us people in the
[29:53] Sunday school class you going to
[29:54] understand one thing we got to progress
[29:56] in God that's right we got to progress
[29:58] in God if we don't prog God is
[30:00] Progressive he's not regressive okay
[30:04] he's Progressive and if we have a fault
[30:06] and we have a failure God forgive me but
[30:08] don't say God forgive me 25 times in a
[30:11] month for the same identical thing and
[30:13] then then two months later you're still
[30:15] saying forgive me Lord forgive me no I
[30:19] like what brother Jason said at the at
[30:20] the watch KN service he said repentance
[30:23] good old true repentance is you were
[30:25] doing this and now you turn around and
[30:28] you go in a totally different direction
[30:30] than where you've been going that's
[30:31] repentance that's right it's not Lord
[30:33] forgive me Lord forgive me and you're
[30:34] still walking in the same direction it's
[30:36] a total turn around and go in the
[30:38] opposite
[30:39] direction that's if you got problem
[30:41] brother said if you sting you give money
[30:43] away what he said he should do the vice
[30:45] versa I'm making myself you hear this
[30:48] I'm making myself read the Bible every
[30:50] day making myself read the Bible cuz cuz
[30:53] physically you really sometimes don't
[30:55] want to right I'm making myself read the
[30:58] Bible more than I've ever read it before
[31:00] I'm making myself pray and I failed last
[31:03] night cuz I fell asleep without praying
[31:05] but this morning I said God forgive me
[31:07] I'm going to start I'm going to you
[31:09] bring it to my
[31:10] remembrance bring it to my remembrance
[31:12] and we'll take care of we got to
[31:15] go Ponder on these
[31:26] things oh
