[10:56] here it's time for the Youth Camp
[11:00] time for the Youth Camp so we've already
[11:03] collected a few dollars and the rest of
[11:05] the dollars you're sitting on
[11:07] them so we need some
[11:10] cash uh we're going to feed the crew
[11:14] again over at brother burle's Camp by
[11:17] the will of the Lord we've done it this
[11:19] will be the third year third year and
[11:22] we've got a few uh contributors but we
[11:26] need some more we're not going to need
[11:28] as much this year but we're still going
[11:31] to need some uh funds to buy the uh to
[11:35] buy the food uh they're expecting a few
[11:38] more people than last year which would
[11:39] be close to 160 people uh children that
[11:43] for the camp and I think we kind of
[11:45] already got the crew together some of
[11:47] the ones that went last year never want
[11:48] to return but some of the ones that went
[11:51] last
[11:53] year no
[11:55] names but the ones that had fun they'll
[11:59] be back so we had fun last year and year
[12:02] before last two if anybody else wants to
[12:03] volunteer or if anybody wants to stay
[12:06] there's um we've got a A list of the uh
[12:09] there's days in in Simpsonville South
[12:12] Carolina that's not too far away if
[12:13] anybody wants to go and participate
[12:15] there will not be a Thursday this year
[12:18] it'll just be Friday afternoon Saturday
[12:20] and Sunday so we won't have to cook as
[12:22] much but we're still going to need to
[12:25] cook um Friday afternoon all day
[12:27] Saturday and Sunday today so if you
[12:30] would if you want to uh do it like we
[12:32] did last year I think we give them you
[12:34] give the money to Sister Lisa and run it
[12:37] through the church if you wish or just
[12:38] some of you have already just handed
[12:40] cash or written a check so you can take
[12:42] it off on your taxes whatever just give
[12:44] it to Sister Leisa and she keep up with
[12:46] it and we'll uh uh we'll buy all the
[12:48] food we're uh we're being Frugal with
[12:51] your money I know I think you all know
[12:54] that we we don't try to uh have steak
[12:57] and lobster every night
[12:59] but we do try to give the kids a good
[13:02] meal to eat and sister Gwen and and
[13:05] sister June and and brother Joe and I
[13:07] really get into to doing the uh the menu
[13:12] I really enjoy that and and then we get
[13:14] help from others and new recipes and
[13:16] some things Gwen likes to do is kind of
[13:18] weird so we don't do them but she
[13:22] they're big help and brother Joe and
[13:24] sister Glen really helped us a lot and
[13:26] and sister joy and Danny I'm not going
[13:27] to forget them I in my notes so but all
[13:30] that's helped we really appreciate it
[13:33] but we're trying to get together now
[13:34] it's July the
[13:36] 29th 30th and the 31st so we'll be
[13:40] leaving on that Friday morning Lord
[13:43] willing with the food so we need to go
[13:45] ahead and start Gathering it up if you
[13:46] got anything you can give us we surely
[13:48] would appreciate it and like I said um
[13:51] it's something we like to do every year
[13:53] as a church not out of the church funds
[13:55] but as a people and uh as a church group
[13:59] you've always done uh exceedingly
[14:02] abundantly we've never had to ask for
[14:04] anything else uh We've maybe have 10 or
[14:07] $15 left over so the Lord's really done
[14:10] well you know we kind of uh leave some
[14:12] stuff over for next year and we have
[14:14] some stuff left from last year uh that
[14:16] we use this year which is uh we don't
[14:19] use it for anything else but for the
[14:20] camp so it's from you the Spoken Word
[14:23] Church people uh it comes from you and
[14:27] the people there really appreci app
[14:29] because without it when they first got
[14:30] started without it they would not have
[14:32] enough money to even have the camp they
[14:34] couldn't afford to pay the the total
[14:37] amount so we pitched in and and provided
[14:39] the food and provided the labor so thank
[14:43] you all of you that labor with us and

[14:47] billfold out of your pocket we thank you

[21:12] us preaching for the weekend so remember
[21:14] these things and just you know let's see
[21:17] any other
[21:19] announcements I think that's covered
[21:21] everything all right the man yeah just
[21:24] you know you brothers that are going
[21:26] meet after the services and uh that way
[21:29] your wiv will be gone so you have a
[21:30] little time we can sit down and and talk
[21:33] and uh you know and that way we we can
[21:36] discuss what we're going to do so
[21:38] remember that amen I made the statement
[21:40] this morning I put it on early on the
[21:42] message but a lot of people you know
[21:44] they they think that you just make a
[21:47] statement but you know what I said about
[21:50] the prophet and what he said this is off
[21:52] of the stature of perfect man preached
[21:53] in
[21:54] 1962 10:14 the morning service uh he
[21:59] says talking about the uh Catholic
[22:02] church and they how they doing and see
[22:05] how the this deceit what they're trying
[22:07] to do give money away to buy why they're
[22:10] trying to break it and they're doing it
[22:13] and she's broke and what is it on the
[22:15] gold stand it's on the gold standard and
[22:18] the Catholic Church the hierarchy owns
[22:20] the gold of the world someone says $168
[22:25] billion well brother Joe ran it up just
[22:27] a moment ago and a
[22:29] 1994 audit that they listed
[22:34] 479 billion in stocks 410 billion in
[22:38] cash
[22:39] 479 billion in stocks and bonds 29
[22:43] billion in gold and 470 billion in fixed
[22:48] assets like investments in real estate
[22:50] so that's how much more they've gain
[22:52] since even they were talking back there
[22:54] but here's what I was a statement I was
[22:56] making see and they the Catholic Church
[22:59] they own the gold of the world there
[23:02] they are throw her right back on the
[23:03] gold standard and you people just keep
[23:06] your homes and things but you belong to
[23:09] the Catholic church I just wanted to put
[23:11] that on brother Joe run it off for me
[23:13] you know I know there is plenty of
[23:16] things that people can say and brother
[23:17] Joe ran off another one for we're not to
[23:20] be around here when all of these things
[23:21] are made into finality we agree cuz
[23:24] we're not going through the tribulation
[23:26] that's not what we're talking about
[23:28] right but you know the uh the prophet
[23:31] said it so we're not looking forward to
[23:33] it we just know what will take place cuz
[23:36] we're sitting right now if they had
[23:38] demanded payment from Russia when they
[23:41] demanded payment from Russia if they
[23:43] demanded our payment we would have been
[23:44] busted right then and that would have
[23:47] been it but it couldn't happened because
[23:49] see we are the image to the Beast so
[23:53] we're the only people in the world that
[23:54] can control the rest of the world with
[23:56] our Firepower and you know planes and
[23:59] things so we're being able to be
[24:02] protected for a while but don't worry
[24:05] about that is coming too but who's
[24:06] worried see I'm not concerned I'm
[24:08] concerned with getting into word getting
[24:10] ready to get out of here because before
[24:12] the Antichrist comes in in full swing
[24:15] the man of sin the prophet said we would
[24:18] get out of here all right you know so
[24:21] we're doing that all right Ephesians 1
[24:24] and Romans 8 father we thank you and we
[24:27] ask you to just help us now and give
[24:29] understanding unto us Lord we see the
[24:32] day and the hour that we're living upon
[24:33] the natural out here in the land and all
[24:35] the things that are taking place but we
[24:38] know and realize that in reality form
[24:40] that all of that is just to to be a a
[24:43] thing for life but we care not for life
[24:46] we care for eternal life we ask you now
[24:49] that you would just guide us as we read
[24:52] your word and speak on you you come on
[24:53] the scene and talk to our hearts forgive
[24:56] our sins and lead us Lord you promised
[24:58] it in your word that you'd come Among Us
[25:00] and heal our sick and Deliver us because
[25:03] it is your word we thank you in Jesus
[25:06] name
[25:08] amen I'm not looking forward to being
[25:11] shut up I'm looking forward to going up
[25:13] but the prophet said they would be
[25:15] concentration camps up in Alaska and
[25:18] things for us
[25:20] so the bride would be physically bereth
[25:23] all right see all right that's not
[25:26] that's just saying what he say amen you
[25:28] say well a bride's not going to go
[25:30] through these things well you
[25:32] know I hope not that's I'm just like
[25:36] that the the man there the Bible when it
[25:38] come up you know and said you know they
[25:40] talking about this that and the other
[25:41] you know and he said well you know uh I
[25:44] think we'll just be down there two
[25:45] years I'm sure that Prophet looked at
[25:48] him and said amen I hope so but God
[25:51] ain't spoke to
[25:53] me well they was down there their 70 so
[25:55] that was it okay let's read the word and
[25:58] it's
[25:59] going blessed be the God and father of
[26:01] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[26:03] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[26:05] places in Christ according as he has
[26:07] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[26:09] of the world that we should be holy and
[26:11] Without Blame before him in love having
[26:14] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[26:16] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[26:19] according to the good pleasure of his
[26:21] will let's just stop there and go over
[26:23] to Romans now and we'll go over about to
[26:27] n 19 th verse because we're going to try
[26:29] to pick up a point and move on this
[26:31] afternoon a little Romans 8:19 for the
[26:34] earnest expectation of the creature
[26:37] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[26:39] of God for the creature was made subject
[26:42] unto vanity not willingly but by reason
[26:44] of him who has subjected the same in
[26:46] Hope because the creature itself also
[26:48] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[26:50] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[26:53] the children of God for we know that the
[26:55] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[26:57] t together until now and not only they
[27:01] but ourselves also are you groaning
[27:04] that's right Amen to be changed that's
[27:07] right all right and not only they but
[27:09] ourselves also which are the first fruit
[27:12] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[27:14] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[27:16] adoption to it the Redemption of our
[27:21] body you may be seated the Lord had his
[27:23] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[27:28] not to back up but just for in case
[27:30] somebody own the internet systems and
[27:32] all tapes pick these up we try to say a
[27:35] few words of background to where that
[27:38] you'll know what we're talking about and
[27:39] maybe stir interest in uh going backward
[27:43] and listening to the messages we're
[27:45] talking about adoption in three stages
[27:48] all right not uh three different things
[27:51] it's not that way it's the pre stages
[27:53] just like justification sanctification
[27:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost father son
[27:57] Holy Ghost it's all saying and showing
[28:00] that that you know it's all this
[28:03] continual working of the Holy Spirit the
[28:06] revealing of his word and all and not
[28:09] something different not one thing being
[28:10] one thing another being another
[28:12] different up and down you know uh I just
[28:16] that's I'm just plain of what I say it's
[28:19] just like the prophet when he was uh the
[28:21] first second and third pull we can
[28:23] follow the first pool is fishing second
[28:25] pull is fishing the third pool is
[28:28] is what is it deer hunting or something
[28:31] I mean it's uh I thought it was all
[28:34] fishing you know so winding and and the
[28:36] opening go of God's word that's just you
[28:39] know the best I can say it it doesn't
[28:41] change and make it different but we have
[28:45] been talking about as I
[28:47] said adoption in three stages what stage
[28:50] one is the new birth because we must be
[28:52] bought brought into the body of Christ
[28:53] by the new birth all right then the
[28:56] second stage is the adop The Authority
[28:59] or the amount of
[29:00] transfiguration in comparison to the
[29:03] Lord Jesus Christ and his journey and
[29:06] then we went through those now for 13
[29:09] sermons okay bringing you up to that
[29:11] place today we want to try to move into
[29:14] the third stage of adoption which is the
[29:18] Redemption of the body and that's what
[29:20] we're going to be talking about and as
[29:22] One True Believer in the message of the
[29:25] hour and the Bible I I believe in a
[29:28] change of this body that's right I don't
[29:30] believe in getting a new one I believe
[29:33] it's this body is going to be made new
[29:35] why would I live in this for 71 years
[29:38] and then lay it down and get me another
[29:40] one and what would I look like I mean
[29:42] when we get to heav are we all going to
[29:44] be the same size you know then God's not
[29:46] a god of variety that's right you know
[29:49] he just wouldn't I don't I just don't
[29:51] see that I'm not making a joke right and
[29:53] it's making a truth out of it all right
[29:55] and we'll get to it into the message
[29:57] when we get there of studying it brother
[29:59] randam said
[30:02] that we in this body see and and Paul
[30:06] says it we groan that's right why would
[30:10] be groaning in this body and then get
[30:12] another one I know that's a
[30:13] denominational Doctrine now that's held
[30:15] on and it's in the message of the hour
[30:18] of people that are really very popular
[30:21] to preach you know and things and got
[30:23] big followings but they believe that
[30:25] we're going to get a new body yeah and I
[30:27] listened to the man or I wouldn't say it
[30:29] but I was listening to him and and the
[30:32] best I could get out of it was that
[30:34] something happens and we get some kind
[30:36] of a change and we step into some kind
[30:38] of a of a theophany form and then we
[30:41] float around through that and go through
[30:43] life through the through the out on the
[30:45] ashes and the Millennium and we we walk
[30:47] out on the top of our own bodies cuz
[30:49] they're in the earth and and then after
[30:51] somewhere back in the future home we
[30:53] connect back well I don't uh I don't
[30:57] understand that's right I didn't
[30:58] understand it when I heard it but right
[31:01] you know I did listen and I don't say
[31:03] things that I can't you know say I did
[31:05] listen to people to try to explain cuz I
[31:07] do you know cuz I want to know amen
[31:10] that's one thing for sure I want to know
[31:12] that's my whole point amen that's the
[31:14] reason I tell people what I believe
[31:15] right you know most people never tell
[31:16] you what to believe right and I tell you
[31:19] what I believe cuz it's one of two
[31:20] things if I'm wrong you can correct me
[31:22] if I'm right we wouldn't worry about you
[31:25] see everything will be okie dokie but
[31:27] now listen so then we're talking about
[31:29] in three stages and we're coming now to
[31:32] the point of talking about the
[31:34] Redemption of the body all right now I
[31:39] want to make myself
[31:40] plain of what I believe okay now I I
[31:45] always say I never I don't even ask my
[31:47] wife my kids to believe what I believe I
[31:49] preach the gospel if they want to
[31:50] believe it that's up to them cuz I can't
[31:52] make a believe it
[31:54] amen I'm not looking my my thoughts is
[31:57] not on the change of the
[32:00] body you remember years ago how long's
[32:02] that been 30 years ago maybe some of
[32:05] you've been around about 30 years ago
[32:07] might even been close to 40 I said I'll
[32:08] quit trying to go to
[32:10] heaven cuz I realized that the Bible
[32:13] wasn't speaking of that the Bible was
[32:15] speaking about heaven coming here you
[32:18] know here's where I'm going to get
[32:19] eternal life here's where I'm going to
[32:22] be changed in a moment of 29 here's
[32:24] where I'm going to finally come back and
[32:26] live not in this sinful condition no
[32:29] washed off and made a a Utopia uh you
[32:32] know all right but see then I I quit
[32:35] trying to want to go that way I'm want
[32:38] to see about trying to get it here well
[32:40] I'm not talking about see that we come
[32:42] down to the change of the body I can
[32:45] show you where brother R said sure in
[32:46] this seal book that he said uh and he
[32:50] using that scripture groaning for
[32:51] waiting the Redemption of the body he
[32:53] said that'll take place in the first
[32:55] resurrection right y see now we know
[32:57] where that'll finally climax right but
[33:00] my concern is to get what the scripture
[33:03] is talking about right the scripture
[33:06] here in Romans is not talking about the
[33:08] change of the
[33:11] body in reference in the 23rd verse it
[33:14] says and we not only they but ourselves
[33:17] also which have the first fruits of the
[33:19] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[33:22] ourselves waiting for the adoption all
[33:25] right waiting for the
[33:30] adoption to Wi the Redemption of our
[33:34] body all right now what does to wit
[33:37] mean I know you you as witty people
[33:41] smart you know intelligent but still it
[33:43] comes out to the same word right go back
[33:46] to Webster run it down check it out when
[33:48] you say that he's a witty person or to
[33:50] wit see it will still come back to
[33:53] meaning a
[33:55] knowledge cuz see a person who is witty
[33:58] is very knowledgeable right right you
[34:01] know all right so it comes back to the
[34:03] same word as to whip to understand right
[34:09] all right to understand the Redemption
[34:12] of the body that's right if we don't
[34:15] understand the Redemption of the body
[34:17] there won't be a change of this body we
[34:20] will go by the grave and have to come up
[34:24] because of somebody that did get an
[34:26] understand understanding to to to Wi to
[34:30] understand see and I know and realiz and
[34:33] I'm talking to school teachers and
[34:34] things that sitting here so then here's
[34:36] a nth grade education God telling you
[34:38] what a word means I don't have to tell
[34:39] you what it means I just remind you what
[34:41] the Bible's saying about it right to Wi
[34:44] to
[34:46] understand about the Redemption of the
[34:49] body now I'm not going to cover a lot in
[34:52] that this
[34:53] afternoon okay so I'm going to go so far
[34:57] into it and then I'll back out and then
[35:00] I'll wait till the next message because
[35:02] I love to do that because I leave you
[35:04] dangling thinking about it all right and
[35:07] give you time to study it over and think
[35:10] it over right so you go home and do it
[35:12] and I would invite you to please do this
[35:15] within the next week or so listen to our
[35:18] read about 14 times the future home and
[35:23] then when you get through with that go
[35:24] to things that are to be and you you
[35:28] know you'll get the whole do it but now
[35:30] watch to
[35:33] wh now back in the Old Testament it
[35:37] appears in a word there to Wi in Genesis
[35:41] 24 and 21 that is when uh elaser is
[35:45] coming to Rebecca and she tells him I
[35:47] will water your camels and and things
[35:50] you know and all of that and it says to
[35:55] Wi he was
[35:59] wondering there if because that's what
[36:02] he had asked you remember he had asked
[36:06] God kind of a fleece like yep that you
[36:09] know to find the right one let things
[36:11] happen a certain way and he goes on with
[36:13] the fleece to to see if she would you
[36:16] know water the camels and do the things
[36:18] and all and see he was wanting he he he
[36:21] was dealing in his understanding that he
[36:25] was here for a reason and being there
[36:27] for a reason Lord I want understanding
[36:31] is this the right person see so it
[36:34] appears into two wi and it gives you
[36:36] which is a definition of 30 3045 in the
[36:39] Old Testament now it means to know or to
[36:44] understand it means to be made known or
[36:48] to declare the word wi the all right see
[36:52] it's it's it's a word to signifying
[36:55] knowledge of something something and
[36:57] like I said even if it's signifying to
[36:59] where you would read the definition of a
[37:01] witty person it would still mean a
[37:03] knowledgeable person right see because
[37:06] they're they wouldn't be witty if they
[37:07] would knowledge but now that's not
[37:08] always educational form of knowledge
[37:10] that's witty is a different thing all
[37:12] right you come over into the New
[37:14] Testament and you find it used to wit of
[37:18] the grace of God in second Corinthians 8
[37:21] And1 all right that definition is from
[37:24] 11:07 in Strong's Concordance
[37:27] it means to make
[37:28] known to declare to
[37:32] certify give to understand or be
[37:37] recognized the word to it okay now in
[37:42] second Corinthians 5:9 where it says to
[37:45] it that God was in Christ reconciling
[37:49] the world unto himself you'll find it's
[37:51] the number
[37:52] 5613 which gives you like this when in
[37:57] other words to to or when that God was
[38:00] made reconciled in ch or how that God
[38:02] was made you know right in Christ uh or
[38:07] as it
[38:08] were as it were that God was made
[38:12] manifest in Christ see and all of it's
[38:15] coming down to an understanding all
[38:18] right now to read it from the original
[38:20] Greek straight into the uh English
[38:24] language it says this
[38:27] this but also ourselves the first fruits
[38:30] of the spirit having and we ourselves in
[38:35] ourselves grown a
[38:37] sunship looking for the Redemption of
[38:42] the body all right now that's the
[38:44] original translation you know right into
[38:45] the English all right I like to give you
[38:48] these because I like to read it I've got
[38:49] this book you know that a brother gave
[38:51] me brother Phil km years ago and it's
[38:53] called 26 translations of the Bible and
[38:56] it's it's not this thick now so it's not
[38:57] 26 translation it only shows where the
[39:00] different variations if somebody differs
[39:02] a word or two they'll put it in there
[39:04] see if not then they just give you the
[39:06] same definition all right you've heard
[39:08] brother R speak of the ls of
[39:10] translation and he says that it was
[39:12] perfect in text and content all right
[39:16] the lungs of translation it says not
[39:19] only this but ourselves also who have
[39:23] the first fruits of the spirit even when
[39:26] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[39:29] adoption that is the
[39:32] Salvation of our bodies now these are
[39:35] all giving you the two- wit the
[39:37] Redemption of our body from
[39:40] Romans uh
[39:42] 8:23 WJ cornbury these are other Bibles
[39:47] says longing for the adoption that shall
[39:49] Ransom our body from its
[39:52] bondage the 20th century version of the
[39:55] New Testament right says while we
[39:57] eagerly await our full adoption as Sons
[40:01] the Redemption of our bodies way mouth
[40:05] in his translation says as we wait for
[40:07] full sunship in the Redemption of our
[40:10] bodies the new Berkeley translation new
[40:13] Berkeley version says as we await that
[40:18] ride of sunship that involves our bodily
[40:21] Redemption see I'm I'm getting a point
[40:23] to where that you you'll get back to it
[40:25] later on all right JB Phillips says
[40:28] while we wait for the Redemption of our
[40:31] bodies which will mean that at last we
[40:36] have realized our full sunship in him
[40:40] that's it all right now see then Paul is
[40:45] saying that we are
[40:48] groaning whenin ourselves y that's right
[40:52] it's not somewhere else so this is not
[40:54] an outward thing it's not something
[40:55] somewhere there this is within us amen
[40:59] and the only way let's see
[41:02] um it's in the seal book uh the prophet
[41:05] said the only way you can grown is for
[41:07] New Life to have come in I believe it's
[41:09] 79 I believe it's right of the SE B new
[41:12] life to have come in would make us to
[41:13] where we could Gran and see we wouldn't
[41:15] bu no
[41:16] groaning we would only be like nature
[41:19] nature is groaning I'll read you a quote
[41:21] in a little while where brother R said
[41:23] that they can't do that right nature
[41:26] can't grown Like We Grown no they are
[41:29] groaning because they're wanting to be
[41:31] delivered you know the trees they're
[41:34] there won't be any crooked trees in the
[41:36] future home there won't be any uh you
[41:39] know uh uh things that are wrong it's
[41:42] all going to be perfect all right so
[41:44] then but the whole creation or
[41:47] creation is now waiting
[41:50] see for someone
[41:53] to understand
[41:56] all right now I emphasize again and then
[42:00] I'll break away from
[42:02] it that the groaning within
[42:06] us is a desire that's right amen that's
[42:11] been
[42:12] created within us because of the new
[42:15] birth all right and that desire that we
[42:19] have is to come to a place to where that
[42:23] there there is no more pain and Agony or
[42:27] or troubles or heartaches or whatever
[42:31] you know right all right and and that's
[42:34] what we're longing
[42:35] for and you know and like I said now but
[42:38] we can look at it and say well that's
[42:39] over there at the resurrection yeah well
[42:45] if there's no groaning now there's not a
[42:47] resurrection for us am if new life
[42:50] hasn't come in then there's no way of us
[42:53] groaning for for something to do we just
[42:55] like the world is like everything else
[42:58] now here's my point so we get started
[43:00] now all
[43:01] right see we're just not we're not
[43:03] waiting I'm not talking about tonight I
[43:06] mean this afternoon and won't for the
[43:08] next message or maybe uh I'm not talking
[43:13] about something that I'm wanting to be
[43:17] changed he said well boy I'd love to be
[43:19] you know now see you're not listening to
[43:21] my
[43:22] point I don't I don't believe if we I
[43:26] believe if we don't get this right now
[43:28] right right that's right that we will
[43:30] still be groaning but we're going to the
[43:33] ground somebody's going to come to a
[43:35] place well why can't we claim we're
[43:37] going to come to that place and forget
[43:38] it and just let it go see but at this
[43:41] present time I'm not concerned with
[43:43] being changed
[43:47] right I'm concerned with the
[43:52] Revelation to be revealed to me all
[43:54] right now
[43:57] to be healed how do you receive your
[44:00] healing you accept it by faith you say
[44:02] God thank you for my healings Etc we'll
[44:04] get to this in a minute you'll see it
[44:06] but you say Thank You Lord and then he
[44:09] reveals to you amen that you're healed
[44:13] amen right and sometimes it's quite a
[44:15] while before it's delivered right you
[44:18] understand me Abraham believed God but
[44:20] it's 25
[44:22] years right right before he got we'll
[44:25] say 20 for something you know right for
[44:28] he got to the place of getting a change
[44:29] of the body that's right see and he
[44:32] didn't really realize that that he was
[44:34] going to have to go through a change to
[44:36] be able to get an Isaac right cuz he got
[44:39] an ish without a change that was his
[44:42] problem right but see we're looking at
[44:45] something as to try to bring it to a
[44:48] complete end of something instead of
[44:50] looking at God trying to to bring his
[44:53] word and reveal that word word to where
[44:57] that you and I can can stand here right
[45:01] and say I'm
[45:03] redeemed I mean somebody's going to have
[45:05] to do that I said it's like your healing
[45:08] right you say by Stripes I'm Healed all
[45:12] right and you may have to do that for a
[45:14] while but then one day God says you're
[45:17] healed well thank you you tell everybody
[45:20] I'm Healed well well you're still sick
[45:24] you still taking medicine yeah M your
[45:27] around but ain't got nothing to do with
[45:29] it cuz God told me I was
[45:32] healed see and when you get it that away
[45:34] you don't have to worry about it like I
[45:35] told you that doctor said I'll take your
[45:37] kneecap off I life said you won't take
[45:39] my kneecaps off I still got them oh
[45:42] devil heard that once a while he said
[45:43] see there yeah that's been about 25 to
[45:46] 30 years ago you know and all of that
[45:49] but still now watch see the world is
[45:54] waiting for somebody to come to a place
[45:58] that's right that God can speak to them
[46:01] and tell them what's going on and tell
[46:03] them about the word of the hour that
[46:05] we're living all right see waiting on
[46:09] the end time bride to receive the
[46:12] revelation of the Redemption of the body
[46:15] right all right now everybody follow me
[46:17] see I'm not talking about the Redemption
[46:19] of the body that's right that's a change
[46:21] on twinkle an eye that's a that's an
[46:23] easy process that's a a thing that will
[46:26] happen but it only happen
[46:30] because new life has come in here that's
[46:33] right all right so now we try to pick up
[46:36] and and we'll go with it all right so
[46:39] now the prophet said on future home and
[46:42] you can read these as we go along I'll
[46:44] probably scan read them to try to save
[46:46] time cuz anybody order know them that
[46:50] page 49 of the future home that we are a
[46:54] part of this Earth our body that's right
[46:58] your soul is a part of God an attribute
[47:00] of God displayed here on Earth in a body
[47:02] the body is to be redeemed now the
[47:04] Soul's redeemed because it was in sin so
[47:07] God came down by process of
[47:10] justification sanctification baptism of
[47:12] the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul
[47:15] and you see you this out here being part
[47:19] of the earth it's Redeemed by it now how
[47:23] are we Redeemed by it what by by what
[47:26] justification sanctification baptism of
[47:28] the Holy Ghost redeems the soul amen all
[47:30] right now we'll get into the future home
[47:33] if you'll read that we'll get into it
[47:35] and try to preach about it some that
[47:37] you'll see it it's going through the
[47:38] same process but he said it's Redeemed
[47:41] by it you're in the process now it's
[47:45] growing on that's what I
[47:47] like see something
[47:50] growing and we ain't just laying around
[47:52] half well one of these day well you know
[47:55] where we're fine boy the bus is going to
[47:57] pull up you know well like I was trying
[47:59] to say this morning don't be down at
[48:01] that railroad station in Gainesville
[48:03] waiting on the bus cuz it don't go there
[48:06] they've got a bus depot you get in the
[48:09] wrong place you're not supposed to have
[48:11] no problems you know and all but we do
[48:13] we get get in trouble like but now
[48:18] listen in the
[48:22] Redemption of the
[48:24] Soul all right
[48:26] now watch this then we just step over
[48:28] the body and then we'll go back and move
[48:29] a little in the Redemption of the
[48:33] Soul or the person the being whatever
[48:36] you want to call
[48:40] it we must go through what to make a new
[48:42] birth justification sanctification
[48:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes the new
[48:47] birth all right any of those things
[48:49] apart from the other it doesn't work so
[48:51] it's a unit of bringing us to
[48:54] Salvation now in doing that then we come
[48:58] to a state of
[49:02] sanctification okay now remember I'm
[49:05] just hitting the edge of what I want to
[49:06] bring but it is the edge of the
[49:09] revelation of the Redemption of the body
[49:11] right because in
[49:14] Salvation sanctification means cleansed
[49:17] and set aside for
[49:20] service all right the prophet says you
[49:23] go out in the yard you pick up a g
[49:26] yep you've got a reason for that GL
[49:28] that's justification y he said then you
[49:31] don't put it in use he said you take it
[49:33] in the house you wash it you scour it
[49:35] out you cleanse it real good he said
[49:37] that's sanctification righten he said
[49:39] now it's not in service yet he said it's
[49:42] you just got it ready right y all right
[49:45] so what happened when the sanctification
[49:48] came into the the individual is actually
[49:52] it cleansed and claimed that area
[49:57] see call the soul now I know you can
[50:00] argue soul is this and soul is that no
[50:03] soul
[50:04] here going keep
[50:08] going but see it cleanses or cleans it
[50:14] right the just as you read in the future
[50:17] home that when when the blood the blood
[50:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ was dropped out
[50:22] on this Earth at Calvary thank cleansed
[50:26] or claimed this earth right all right
[50:30] see so now we're in the message so I'm
[50:34] encouraging you to read the message of
[50:36] the future home before I preach on it
[50:38] okay okay all right but see it's to set
[50:43] aside to sanctify something you set that
[50:46] vessel aside see yep
[50:51] now I gave you two or three quotes on
[50:54] that so you just go ahead and read
[50:57] but see you come down to word that you
[51:00] must receive
[51:02] then page 17 of the future home which is
[51:06] number four of your
[51:07] notes you come to a place then that what
[51:11] are you talking
[51:13] about that he's brought the church
[51:15] through justification he called it
[51:17] through
[51:18] sanctification then filled it with the
[51:20] Holy Ghost and Fire all right now let me
[51:22] get over here and give you that
[51:24] scripture
[51:26] uh Matthew
[51:29] 3:11 we speaking of the Holy Ghost and
[51:31] Fire all right
[51:34] now so there's more to it than just
[51:37] setting something aside right you must
[51:41] come to the position or place for it to
[51:44] be filled right with the Holy Ghost
[51:46] that's right and fire right now see I
[51:49] know a lot of you Pentecostals talked
[51:52] about the the Holy Ghost and Fire and
[51:54] things that's all right that's that's
[51:55] their business but that
[52:00] fire even that sanctification if you
[52:03] look down page 23 of the future home and
[52:07] he says the Holy Ghost he sent down
[52:08] sanctification then sent the Holy Ghost
[52:10] in Fire and burnt the sin out of him and
[52:13] dwelt inside amen all right now even at
[52:18] justification you find the future home
[52:20] that everything's not just right it just
[52:22] chops off your past sins then that San
[52:25] ification you'll find that it cleanse or
[52:28] sets aside the person and claims that
[52:30] person all right the soul of the
[52:32] individual right but it's still then
[52:34] it's it's not right okay see you get new
[52:39] desires you get new thoughts you get new
[52:41] ways you want to go to church
[52:42] everything's wonderful you're doing
[52:44] better but still you need the Holy Ghost
[52:46] and Fire right all right see now the
[52:50] reason you need the Holy Ghost and
[52:53] Fire see the fire will burn out anything
[52:56] that's
[52:57] left of you that didn't leave out its
[53:01] sanctification you say well it's cleanse
[53:03] and set aside well that's true you can
[53:06] cleanse a vessel to a certain
[53:08] degree but there are certain germs Etc
[53:11] and things that can will not leave out
[53:15] so there is parts of us that we still
[53:17] have troubles we get Sanctified we come
[53:19] to church they said we want to do right
[53:21] we want to live right everything's fine
[53:23] but if we don't have that Holy Ghost
[53:25] inside of us we're not a child of God
[53:28] that's right but we need something to
[53:30] burn out everything that's right to die
[53:33] to ourselves and burn out what's
[53:36] left
[53:38] see cuz sanctification is really a
[53:40] dangerous stage your Prophet explains it
[53:42] he said it even it's like this he said
[53:44] uh you'll go to church and he said if
[53:46] you ain't careful he said there'll be
[53:48] seven demons come back and take their
[53:50] place in there and you're living a good
[53:52] Sanctified life going to church Glory
[53:54] Hallelujah I'm in the message believe
[53:55] everything the prophet said and what is
[53:58] it yeah right seven times worse than it
[54:01] was to start with because he said he
[54:02] makes you a religious demon right amen
[54:05] that's what comes in there as religious
[54:07] things all right taking the place where
[54:10] before you was a drunk and you know all
[54:13] the world a dop addict or a peel head or
[54:15] something and you won't dare do that
[54:17] anymore no no no see cuz you come become
[54:21] religious right but see then you need
[54:23] something to come in and burn that out
[54:26] that's right and remember at
[54:27] sanctification is
[54:29] where the seed is planted right your
[54:33] Prophet says you're begotten at
[54:35] sanctification we'll go back through
[54:36] some of these things he said you're
[54:39] begotten he said like a baby into the
[54:42] wound a baby into the wound is not a
[54:45] baby outside working be called a baby
[54:47] it's a baby in the wound right right
[54:49] that's right see we need more than to
[54:51] just say well I believe God right and he
[54:55] cleansed me he took away my smoking my
[54:57] drinking my gambling my this my
[54:59] adulteries my he took all of that away
[55:01] wonderful thank the Lord so can
[55:04] alcoholics synonymous do a lot of good
[55:05] for you all not putting them in no
[55:08] category with Christianity no just
[55:11] telling it like it is amen all right but
[55:14] still we need something to take place so
[55:17] it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that's
[55:19] right see that fire comes down and burns
[55:22] out all of that just left of use sister
[55:25] Gil cuz there's a lot of us
[55:28] left and see we really need a lot of
[55:30] Holy Ghost and Fire now cuz there's a
[55:32] lot a lot of us left it not to we go out
[55:35] right that's right but we're not on that
[55:37] we're we're laying a foundation for
[55:39] something all right but see one
[55:44] day this
[55:46] world yep will go through a
[55:50] baptism but it's after the
[55:53] Millennium it's just a burning over
[55:55] before the Millennium Armageddon is just
[55:57] a temporarily burning over right all
[55:59] right but then you go through the
[56:00] Millennium and then you come out and
[56:02] they'll have to be a burning amen of
[56:04] everything all right we're not into that
[56:06] we're just laying a little foundation
[56:07] with it but see but you can receive that
[56:10] all right and it makes a way getting you
[56:12] ready all right the world is redeemed
[56:16] the same way as the individual is
[56:20] redeemed all
[56:22] right now let's drop back out of that
[56:26] now because if I precede any further I
[56:28] got to preach the message on to what I'm
[56:30] looking at and I don't want to do it I
[56:31] want to I want this in your
[56:33] mind I want one thing in your
[56:38] mind the biggest portion of the world is
[56:41] systems en counting the ones of this
[56:42] message and I won't call names but a lot
[56:45] of you know the
[56:47] names they believe we're going to get a
[56:49] new
[56:53] body in this message
[56:56] after all the prophet has said and thing
[56:58] and they'll quote you to death about it
[57:01] right and they believe you're going to
[57:02] get you a new body
[57:07] right see I don't know of any organized
[57:11] religion now I'm saying I don't know now
[57:14] okay they never taught anything other
[57:17] than getting a new body right right now
[57:19] if you know about it I'd like to know
[57:21] because I don't know of any other church
[57:23] I don't know of any church that ever
[57:24] talked getting this body redeemed
[57:28] right they thought we're going to get a
[57:30] new body and my just plan old reasons of
[57:33] looking at it is is you know sometimes
[57:35] you just don't think God is good enough
[57:37] or great enough to powerful enough to be
[57:39] able to do that so he just going to make
[57:41] us a new one he's just going to speak
[57:43] one of these days we're going to come
[57:45] out of the Dust of the earth and you
[57:47] know and all of
[57:48] that but you
[57:51] know you won't be you that's right
[57:56] where you going to get it
[57:58] from now I've express my points on these
[58:02] things for many
[58:04] years he brother randam even said that
[58:06] Jesus's body come out of this
[58:10] Earth wholeheartedly agree but did he
[58:13] come out of this dirty stinking rotten
[58:15] stuff that's dirty now
[58:19] no just simple
[58:21] question no it came from the original
[58:25] creation amen abely amen that's the way
[58:28] I like to look at see in the original
[58:30] creation there was no sin right back
[58:32] before this world when it was created
[58:34] and it come from things that was not God
[58:37] spoke it into existence and it was
[58:39] wonderful Perfect Right amen not Eternal
[58:42] because he didn't create the world
[58:43] Eternal that's right see but it's
[58:45] perfect cuz God can't create anything
[58:48] imperfect he didn't create the devil
[58:51] imperfect he created imperfect and let
[58:52] him have his own way and he went
[58:54] imperfect
[58:55] now so then the
[58:58] world see was perfect sin is what's
[59:02] perverted it so when when the body of
[59:05] Jesus Christ came in Hebrews 10:5 a body
[59:08] thou Hast prepared me he simply went
[59:10] back to the same elements that he
[59:12] created this world from and just brought
[59:14] it right into
[59:15] existence you say but that wouldn't be
[59:17] the same body of the world why not
[59:22] right where did Adam come from
[59:27] right did God scoop up dirt and this
[59:30] potx petro and things make body you know
[59:32] for Adam or did he just
[59:35] speak the prophet said one day God will
[59:39] speak and he said we won't have to come
[59:42] forth like man thinks he said we'll just
[59:45] he'll just speak and that body will come
[59:47] right out of the earth I've gave you the
[59:49] illustration over a thousands of times
[59:52] that you know the prophet said it's not
[59:54] necessarily the same gases right right
[59:58] why why were you making that statement I
[1:00:01] told you why an Africa in Africa you're
[1:00:04] in Africa and a line grabs you and he
[1:00:07] kills you and he eats some of you and
[1:00:10] they grab the line with a net and they
[1:00:12] throw him in a boat and turn him down to
[1:00:14] a ship and Flame and they get him to
[1:00:16] America about half a day later and out
[1:00:19] goes the bathroom guy you know and
[1:00:21] that's part of
[1:00:23] you part of you is in Africa part of you
[1:00:26] is in
[1:00:29] America no problem with me right right
[1:00:32] cuz 16 elements is 16 elements that's
[1:00:36] right he don't have to go over and dig a
[1:00:39] hole it won't be a hole where Paul's at
[1:00:42] a Hool in the
[1:00:44] ground I don't know where you've ever if
[1:00:47] you ever been out where
[1:00:49] you took a bulldozer and pushed up
[1:00:51] ground you can tell in a hurry whether
[1:00:53] there's anybody ever been buried there
[1:00:54] or not right sure any of you ever been
[1:00:56] there and seen that happen
[1:00:59] right it don't look the
[1:01:01] same you'll have a red clay Bank you can
[1:01:04] cut that bank off straight as can be and
[1:01:05] you'll have a red clay bank right in the
[1:01:08] middle of it you'll have a round
[1:01:10] circular length of that
[1:01:12] body that doesn't look like the rest of
[1:01:14] it you can tell in a hurry whether or
[1:01:16] not it's start see but what am I getting
[1:01:19] at I'm getting one
[1:01:23] point our bodies came out of this Earth
[1:01:27] y from Mom and Daddy Jesus's body came
[1:01:30] by the spoken
[1:01:32] word all right so he will speak again
[1:01:34] one day and we will come forth I agree
[1:01:37] we know that all right amen but I'm not
[1:01:39] concerned about that part I'm concerned
[1:01:41] about something just a little bit prior
[1:01:43] to
[1:01:45] them which where we are right
[1:01:49] now now we're going to get down to some
[1:01:51] things it's we're going to talk about
[1:01:52] something it's your Propet kept
[1:01:55] emphasizing but people don't want to
[1:01:57] emphasize it anymore
[1:02:00] maybe but he says Christianity is based
[1:02:03] upon
[1:02:07] Resurrection not replacement AB
[1:02:11] Resurrection that's
[1:02:13] right so Christianity is based now I
[1:02:16] gave you some quotes down through there
[1:02:17] about three of each one and that's what
[1:02:19] I try to
[1:02:20] give the Christianity is based on
[1:02:23] Resurrection yep
[1:02:27] m not
[1:02:28] replacement right
[1:02:31] right it's on the message number eight
[1:02:33] on you notes questions and answers in
[1:02:35] Hebrews part 2
[1:02:37] 5712 Christianity is based upon
[1:02:39] Resurrection not replacement
[1:02:41] Resurrection the same Jesus went down
[1:02:44] the same Jesus come back that's right if
[1:02:47] you go down redheaded you come back
[1:02:49] redheaded if you go down blackheaded you
[1:02:52] come back blackheaded see it's a
[1:02:56] resurrection now a lot of us may go down
[1:03:23] grayheadedgamer for sure you ain't lost
[1:03:25] any hirs you heard that right they're
[1:03:28] there waiting on us it's going to come
[1:03:29] back all right then Christianity is
[1:03:32] based upon Resurrection not
[1:03:35] replacement the same Jesus that went
[1:03:37] down is the same Jesus that come back
[1:03:40] and according to the scriptures he had
[1:03:42] then nailed the prince in his hands um I
[1:03:45] wrote it all the way through my notes
[1:03:46] and done got off all my notes okay John
[1:03:48] 20 I guess it's John 20 26 and 27 that
[1:03:52] Jesus said put your hands in to my side
[1:03:55] put your fingers in other words into my
[1:03:57] he was standing there with a body that's
[1:04:00] right that had nail prints and hold in
[1:04:02] his side oh of course I know great great
[1:04:06] understanding of Supernatural Revelation
[1:04:07] Brother D you don't understand that it
[1:04:09] was changed after the
[1:04:11] end well I don't like him changed after
[1:04:13] the end right right that's what I said I
[1:04:15] don't like where brother R may come
[1:04:16] along they said but but he changed later
[1:04:20] no you know what he said on the future
[1:04:22] home to that's twice I'm pretty sure but
[1:04:24] he said I know it his first one he said
[1:04:26] I've taught three processes from a boy
[1:04:29] that's right and you know what people
[1:04:31] are saying now this not justification
[1:04:33] sanctification baptism of it's just the
[1:04:35] Holy Ghost yeah that's right but I'm
[1:04:39] just going to stay what he says now
[1:04:41] that's that's just my point because that
[1:04:43] way I can see how it lines up all right
[1:04:46] watch him where he gets down to the uh
[1:04:49] yeah the next one he'll cover to
[1:04:51] basically the same
[1:04:52] place uh let's read read it uh life
[1:04:55] preached in
[1:04:56] 1958 uh 519 e14 Christianity is based on
[1:05:00] Resurrection we know that not not well
[1:05:03] if you go down here and on Earth as a
[1:05:05] blackheaded woman you'll rise as a
[1:05:07] blackheaded woman you won't rise up you
[1:05:10] say well now if this is a what goes down
[1:05:14] in Resurrection that same has to come up
[1:05:18] not this and that's replacement so in
[1:05:21] other words he's saying if you done
[1:05:22] anything else is replacement that's not
[1:05:24] Resurrection resurrections bring the
[1:05:27] same Jesus up that went down the same
[1:05:30] person all right so if that's true then
[1:05:32] we're going down the same way coming
[1:05:33] back Garnet's funeral preach
[1:05:36] 1963 Garnet PS funeral 8 11:18 all
[1:05:40] Christianity is based on Resurrection
[1:05:42] that's our hopes now let's find out why
[1:05:45] the creator has so set it in order if we
[1:05:49] did not even have a Bible we would still
[1:05:51] know that Christianity was right
[1:05:54] now Resurrection is not replacement
[1:05:56] Resurrection is bringing the same thing
[1:05:58] up that went down if I should drop the
[1:06:01] the Bible from the stand on the floor
[1:06:03] and catch some another Bible and replace
[1:06:06] it that's replacement but Resurrection
[1:06:08] is bringing the same Bible up that went
[1:06:11] down and that's what Resurrection means
[1:06:13] it means to be raised up all right
[1:06:16] Christianity is placed up
[1:06:19] on Resurrection y not replacement amen
[1:06:25] now so then why would it
[1:06:29] be that it would be
[1:06:32] necessary to preedee this should give
[1:06:36] you an idea of where we're going why
[1:06:38] would it be necessary to
[1:06:40] precede the prophet's
[1:06:43] message with a Divine Healing
[1:06:46] campaign right that's according to
[1:06:49] Malachi 4
[1:06:50] right Malachi 4 says the son of
[1:06:53] righteousness will Rising healing in his
[1:06:54] wings that's a healing
[1:06:57] campaign so before brother Brand's
[1:06:59] message could come his real message cuz
[1:07:01] his message began in ' 63 right not in
[1:07:04] the years of preparation cuz that was
[1:07:06] what Paul and him had already preached
[1:07:08] it began in' 63 of the opening of the
[1:07:10] seal all right
[1:07:13] now there would have to be a Divine
[1:07:16] Healing
[1:07:19] campaign all right now God is going to
[1:07:23] show them
[1:07:27] even back there in his Divine Healing
[1:07:29] campaign he was going to show what he's
[1:07:32] going to do
[1:07:34] right there was not a Divine Healing
[1:07:36] campaign in Luther's age Wesley's age or
[1:07:40] even the beginning of Pentecost now
[1:07:42] there was a lot of healing and signs and
[1:07:44] wonders in Pentecost right ausa Street
[1:07:47] come on
[1:07:50] but it basically began with brother
[1:07:52] brandom right NE even they listed with
[1:07:55] brother randam and or Roberts right so
[1:07:57] somewhere in the 30s there you begin the
[1:08:01] the late parts and you begin to talk
[1:08:03] about Divine
[1:08:05] Healing that's why they couldn't
[1:08:06] understand brother brandom because the
[1:08:08] word Divine Healing was meant but it was
[1:08:10] not Divine Healing that he was a Divine
[1:08:12] healer it was Divine Healing in that God
[1:08:16] is going to heal amen and he did that's
[1:08:20] what it means Divine Healing Divine
[1:08:22] Healing doesn't mean that you'll never
[1:08:23] get sick again
[1:08:24] cuz you can be sick of something be
[1:08:25] healed of it die the same thing it
[1:08:28] doesn't mean it's that way and that's
[1:08:29] where they misunderstood him cuz see it
[1:08:32] had to be
[1:08:34] though it had to be that a Divine
[1:08:36] Healing campaign would strike the world
[1:08:39] right to set a
[1:08:43] stage like I said now go back in the
[1:08:46] Bible and find it or the prophet's
[1:08:47] message and find it go back into history
[1:08:49] and find there's not not one in Lutheran
[1:08:52] Wesley right not one in early Pentecost
[1:08:56] it was right around 1940 somewhere 30
[1:08:58] something to 40 that it started a Divine
[1:09:00] Healing campaign all right that would
[1:09:04] show that the son of righteousness would
[1:09:06] arise with healings in his
[1:09:08] wings all right people accepted that yes
[1:09:14] I've heard of myself and you have two of
[1:09:16] the the Great Men of the day ke osbor
[1:09:19] and different ones it says that they saw
[1:09:22] God y they saw a great man that would
[1:09:26] that God would honor his word and that
[1:09:30] you know even to the man that said when
[1:09:33] he's praying said it's God but said when
[1:09:36] he starts talking said it's William Bram
[1:09:39] well even that was an honor because
[1:09:42] other people didn't how that said about
[1:09:44] them all right but see it's coming to
[1:09:48] the
[1:09:49] place to where that something would be
[1:09:53] be start being set in
[1:09:56] motion all
[1:09:58] right now number 12 on your notes we
[1:10:01] jump a lot through the message so you
[1:10:02] read in between on a message called here
[1:10:05] ye him 1956
[1:10:07] 12:15 say no one can preach
[1:10:11] salvation without preaching Divine
[1:10:14] Healing you remember that was an
[1:10:15] argument with Dr Bess which is the next
[1:10:17] one down below there the angel of the
[1:10:19] Lord and Dr be talking to that man about
[1:10:22] it you know and the man was talking
[1:10:23] against Divine
[1:10:25] Healing no one can preach salvation
[1:10:28] without preaching Divine Healing so you
[1:10:30] can't preach Redemption of the
[1:10:33] Soul without preaching Redemption of the
[1:10:37] body see when you can't deal with sin in
[1:10:41] any measure L you deal with sickness and
[1:10:45] every
[1:10:48] attribute all
[1:10:50] right so what are we looking at
[1:10:54] no Divine Healing he
[1:10:57] says No Redemption of the body what do
[1:11:00] he say Divine Healing was the angel of
[1:11:02] the Lord 19
[1:11:04] 51502 says we have the earnest if
[1:11:07] there's no Divine Healing There's No
[1:11:09] Redemption of the body we have the
[1:11:13] earnest the down payment of our
[1:11:17] Salvation now right
[1:11:20] now Divine Healing is an earnest
[1:11:27] okay
[1:11:30] now if salvation is in
[1:11:33] stages justification sanctification
[1:11:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost being each one
[1:11:39] a deeper work or meaning of God you know
[1:11:43] something taking
[1:11:45] place why can't we look at the
[1:11:47] Redemption of the body the same
[1:11:50] way see in the Redemption of the Soul
[1:11:55] even if we come to the New Birth it's
[1:11:57] just the earnest of our inheritance the
[1:12:00] new
[1:12:02] birth but see healing of the body
[1:12:06] is a down
[1:12:09] payment right now that's why I can't
[1:12:12] understand since once I've seen it now
[1:12:13] it's like everybody else when I was an
[1:12:14] organized religion I believe like
[1:12:16] everybody else cuz that's all I
[1:12:17] know we going to get a new body Glory
[1:12:20] Hallelujah they just smoke like
[1:12:21] everything we don't have to worry about
[1:12:23] this
[1:12:24] we going to throw this one down and get
[1:12:25] us another one you know you right
[1:12:29] right no matter what you do to this one
[1:12:31] well see I remember the Bible said for
[1:12:33] me not to do them things so I didn't do
[1:12:35] them that's before I come in the message
[1:12:38] I didn't like smoking so I throw it away
[1:12:40] never did drink never care nothing about
[1:12:42] none of that didn't care about vulgarity
[1:12:44] cuz I like my teeth to stay pretty
[1:12:46] straight and I knew if you said a lot of
[1:12:47] dirty words you can get your mouth
[1:12:48] busted I'm
[1:12:50] honest I no salvation set me free
[1:12:55] I just didn't care anything about all
[1:12:57] that H but you
[1:13:01] see if there's no Divine
[1:13:05] Healing There's No Redemption of the
[1:13:08] body now that's what your Prophet just
[1:13:10] say that's right if God can't heal this
[1:13:13] body he can't change the body right but
[1:13:16] if he can heal the body he can change
[1:13:18] the body cuz it's an
[1:13:21] Earnest so then they had to be a healing
[1:13:24] campaign strike the world that's right
[1:13:27] before the prophet would come with a
[1:13:29] message that would be dealing with the
[1:13:32] Redemption I hope you write that down
[1:13:35] there had to be a healing campaign
[1:13:38] right to show the healing of the body
[1:13:41] would be perfect and right right to show
[1:13:44] it could be done because mankind always
[1:13:46] believed in
[1:13:47] healing
[1:13:50] right Martin Luther preached and and
[1:13:54] prayed for the sick y had all kind of
[1:13:57] signs and wonders taking place
[1:14:01] right John Wesley rode a horse for 5,000
[1:14:05] m a year preaching the gospel and the
[1:14:07] sick being healed and wouldn't he the
[1:14:09] one that the horse fell in the hole and
[1:14:10] broke his leg or whatever he got off he
[1:14:12] said God made me heal me God made the
[1:14:15] horse heal it pray the horse for the
[1:14:17] horse got on it and rode
[1:14:21] off there always been those things but
[1:14:25] never a never a Divine Healing campaign
[1:14:28] never a worldwide sweeping thing right
[1:14:31] Luther it was a worldwide sweeping of
[1:14:33] the message of the just shall live by
[1:14:35] faith right sanctification was a
[1:14:38] worldwide sweeping of of cleansing up
[1:14:41] the life and and getting ourselves
[1:14:43] Clean zeusa Street 1906 was a worldwide
[1:14:47] sweeping of the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:49] Ghost the gifts being restored right y
[1:14:53] and those would be the healing amen but
[1:14:56] then there would come a time that there
[1:14:58] had to be a healing campaign strike the
[1:15:01] world to show God was going to show that
[1:15:05] he could heal
[1:15:07] right until even your Prophet said the
[1:15:10] Beatles said they were going to start a
[1:15:11] healing
[1:15:13] campaign right right such a pull in
[1:15:18] their day that's right until people were
[1:15:22] healed
[1:15:24] just by hearing
[1:15:28] music a healing campaign sweeps the
[1:15:32] world why cuz it's getting
[1:15:35] ready ready for what ready for the
[1:15:39] message to come that would BL bring into
[1:15:44] being an understanding of how that we
[1:15:47] can come to a Redemption of the body see
[1:15:50] I'm moving into it I got to back up
[1:15:52] again okay
[1:15:56] but see no matter what brother R said
[1:15:59] look and see he said that lady sitting
[1:16:01] there crippled up was said just a moment
[1:16:07] yep just a
[1:16:09] moment see it wasn't just brother
[1:16:11] brandom it's credited that brother
[1:16:12] brandham and all Roberts were the
[1:16:14] spearhead of the Divine Healing campaign
[1:16:17] right we believe that but see people
[1:16:20] went around but around and prayed for a
[1:16:22] man that know was missing 3 or 4 days or
[1:16:24] something before the nose restored
[1:16:26] brother BOS prayed for a man's nose that
[1:16:28] was missing eat all with cancer and it
[1:16:30] was instantly
[1:16:34] restored a Divine Healing campaign
[1:16:36] struck the world because God was going
[1:16:39] to testify of what he was going to bring
[1:16:41] into
[1:16:42] being y he was going to show first that
[1:16:45] he could heal the
[1:16:50] body he's going to prove to the world
[1:16:53] and he can heal the
[1:16:54] body do you hear Brother random telling
[1:16:57] he said bring me 24 of your worst cases
[1:17:00] and I will guarantee you healing for
[1:17:02] every one of them now where's there ever
[1:17:04] been a man standing like that
[1:17:11] right that's how much he knew where he
[1:17:16] stood but he said knowing the message
[1:17:19] would
[1:17:21] come don't you ever listen the brother
[1:17:23] around saying
[1:17:25] that he said knowing the message with
[1:17:28] come what
[1:17:34] message the message to show us the
[1:17:36] revealing of the Redemption of the
[1:17:39] body so that we can to it
[1:17:42] understand but get this right if we
[1:17:44] don't understand
[1:17:48] healing we don't understand Redeeming
[1:17:51] the body
[1:17:55] but a God that can take a cancere eaten
[1:17:57] patient and instantly restore them
[1:18:00] right till they can't even find
[1:18:05] it how much more would it take for him
[1:18:08] to just move that right on out in the
[1:18:09] rest of us that's right amen but the
[1:18:12] only difference was he's only going to
[1:18:14] restore that person back to original
[1:18:18] Health other words cancer gone the eat
[1:18:21] up the the whatever's done is gone
[1:18:23] and a lot of times God doesn't choose to
[1:18:25] do it that way right that's right the
[1:18:28] life goes out of the cancer the body has
[1:18:29] to purify the cancer or either go have
[1:18:32] it taken out or whatever sometimes it
[1:18:35] makes a patient that much more sicker
[1:18:37] because the body is reacting trying to
[1:18:39] help its own self because God in the
[1:18:41] beginning put in you in the
[1:18:44] garden
[1:18:46] right an ability to fight off
[1:18:50] diseases an immune system
[1:18:54] y you know people don't die of
[1:18:57] age you don't die of age that's right
[1:19:00] what brother dying around the world you
[1:19:02] don't die of
[1:19:03] age you die of
[1:19:07] complications age is not the killer it's
[1:19:09] a destroyer of the immune system right
[1:19:12] when you destroy the immune system then
[1:19:14] anything else takes over
[1:19:16] right they just can't figure out how to
[1:19:18] B pass and help the immune system
[1:19:19] they're doing a good job now helping
[1:19:21] people they don't kill people
[1:19:25] right we wind up probably more killed by
[1:19:28] drugs than anything else but yeah that's
[1:19:30] all right we still believe in medicine
[1:19:33] amen watch what he says here on the pool
[1:19:35] of Bethesda 19581 18 he talking about
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:39] Redeemed God sent his son made in the
[1:19:41] form of sinful flesh that's redeemed us
[1:19:44] and we believe now that we have the
[1:19:45] earnest of our Salvation a foretaste of
[1:19:48] what heaven will be by the Holy
[1:19:51] Spirit
[1:19:54] and we believe that through Divine
[1:19:56] Healing we have the earnest of our
[1:19:58] redeemed bodies father a crippled up
[1:20:02] woman nervous sick but Thou Art here
[1:20:04] remove this curse have mercy upon her go
[1:20:08] to go home
[1:20:12] well you see what we're dealing
[1:20:15] with no wonder he would make this
[1:20:19] statement he said we talk about all kind
[1:20:21] of faith he said we ain't even got
[1:20:23] enough Faith to heal a two
[1:20:28] thing come on oh bless God I tell you no
[1:20:32] don't holler too much cuz you're going
[1:20:34] to make the devil mad at you you make
[1:20:36] the devil mad at you going to jump on
[1:20:38] you right right right don't challenge
[1:20:42] him unless you got the
[1:20:44] goods old boy that used to work with
[1:20:46] everybody thought he was a big blow you
[1:20:48] know and I knew better than what a lot
[1:20:50] of them did about him and you know so
[1:20:53] one day a guy that's jumped up and
[1:20:54] puffed in his face well he just knocked
[1:20:56] the fire out of it and gave a good
[1:20:57] whooping well come find out everybody
[1:20:59] found out what I already knew he
[1:21:01] wouldn't such a bluff anyway just don't
[1:21:03] Bluff the devil unless you got the
[1:21:05] goods cuz he's a bluff and he's a
[1:21:08] professional but he can fight
[1:21:13] too you better have the goods when you
[1:21:15] challenge him you say I take every
[1:21:17] spirit in this building under my control
[1:21:19] your Prophet said you better you better
[1:21:20] have it CU if you don't you just open up
[1:21:23] the cans and made him mad at you right
[1:21:25] see but if there's no Divine Healing
[1:21:27] there is no Earnest of our redeemed body
[1:21:32] y do you understand what I'm talking
[1:21:35] about then a Divine Healing campaign
[1:21:36] struck the
[1:21:38] world God was setting the
[1:21:41] stage and you know he never stopped
[1:21:43] setting
[1:21:46] it Divine Healing didn't
[1:21:49] stop with the prophet amen they're
[1:21:53] proven it out there even in the world
[1:21:54] they're still they're having healing
[1:21:55] campaigns all around the world people
[1:21:57] are being healed right come on
[1:22:00] yes you you don't have to be in this
[1:22:02] message to have a healing campaign
[1:22:04] that's right matter of fact the people
[1:22:05] in this message are not having healing
[1:22:07] campaigns it's the people outside of
[1:22:08] this message that are having but see
[1:22:10] they're living in a bygone day
[1:22:13] right but they're having healings and
[1:22:15] things
[1:22:21] y look at number 17 on your notes
[1:22:24] fundamental F foundation for Faith
[1:22:27] 1956 1113 Jesus couldn't come to redeem
[1:22:31] us from just and just sin without
[1:22:33] redeeming us from sickness are all the
[1:22:37] things that goes with it even to death
[1:22:40] that's right he redeemed us from
[1:22:43] death now watch it now this is for later
[1:22:47] he redeemed us from
[1:22:49] death
[1:22:51] what and we do not
[1:22:54] die amen what do you mean we go to the
[1:22:59] funeral every
[1:23:02] day that's not
[1:23:07] dead there's not a scripture in the
[1:23:10] Bible that says a Christian
[1:23:13] dies that's what your Prophet had to say
[1:23:15] about
[1:23:16] it death they said we go to the
[1:23:19] Undertaker we look at it we say death no
[1:23:21] uhuh fear him that can destroy the soul
[1:23:25] y that's
[1:23:26] right that person just moved right out
[1:23:29] of that body right into another
[1:23:31] condition right whether it be sinner or
[1:23:33] Saint that's right there's no way to
[1:23:36] kill the soul God is the only one that
[1:23:37] can kill the soul right okay you just
[1:23:41] step right out of that brother around
[1:23:43] like referring to about the the little
[1:23:44] girl you know that said see there said
[1:23:46] she wasn't dead she was just sleeping
[1:23:49] there in the ministry of Jesus right do
[1:23:52] you understand yes no Divine Healing no
[1:23:57] Resurrection you see why we ought to
[1:23:59] emphasize healing right
[1:24:03] amen we should right
[1:24:07] amen but now I'm also like that on this
[1:24:11] basis and that's the reason I Don't
[1:24:13] Preach like other people I Don't Preach
[1:24:14] against High dress clothes when this
[1:24:16] because if you if you preach every one
[1:24:18] of them the people are going to still be
[1:24:20] the same that's right but if you preach
[1:24:21] the gospel get delivered it'll take care
[1:24:23] of all them things and that's the way I
[1:24:25] preach cuz that's the way I believe it
[1:24:27] well then it wouldn't do us any good to
[1:24:29] say okay now we're going to start and
[1:24:31] we're going to start the ladies can't go
[1:24:34] to Pigeon Forge and the men can't go
[1:24:36] fishing cuz we're going to start
[1:24:37] tomorrow night Tuesday night Wednesday
[1:24:39] night Thurday night Friday night
[1:24:40] Saturday Sunday Monday two or 3 weeks
[1:24:41] we're going to have healing campaign
[1:24:44] every
[1:24:45] night we're going to preach on nothing
[1:24:47] but
[1:24:48] healing well that sounds good you know
[1:24:52] if I've ever led to I do it but never
[1:24:54] been LED do it like that you know why
[1:24:58] cuz I like to do it like Richard was
[1:25:00] done talking testifying of last week I I
[1:25:02] like to preach it and then you get up
[1:25:04] here and come here and tell me I was
[1:25:06] delivered back there I was delivered
[1:25:08] here I was delivered there I like for
[1:25:10] that to happen why because it's you
[1:25:12] taking
[1:25:13] apart see you're catching on to what I'm
[1:25:16] doing right so why have a healing
[1:25:18] campaign every night now we should have
[1:25:20] I agree with you we ought to have
[1:25:22] services for the next 6 months every
[1:25:24] night
[1:25:27] right on the preaching of the
[1:25:32] gospel because the preaching of the
[1:25:34] Gospel will come to
[1:25:36] Healing amen he told me that years ago I
[1:25:40] asked God a question one day and he said
[1:25:43] you preach it and I'll back it
[1:25:46] up all he
[1:25:49] said you think man I've been trying my
[1:25:51] best to to preach all I can he said no
[1:25:53] but you ain't bringing it
[1:25:56] right you preach the gospel and I'll
[1:25:58] back it up you preach the truth and I'll
[1:26:01] back it
[1:26:02] up I started doing the best I could
[1:26:04] preach to the truth and you think I
[1:26:06] wasn't trying to preach the truth before
[1:26:08] then I just seen the importance of
[1:26:10] preaching of the
[1:26:12] word I can get up here and start and I
[1:26:14] can bring up Al and how that that his
[1:26:17] mother is so and so and his daddy's so
[1:26:18] and so and brother collie I can bring up
[1:26:20] somebody in his family or something like
[1:26:22] that I can go back in there and I can
[1:26:24] get every one of your feelings and have
[1:26:25] you just feeling good you know you just
[1:26:27] really all you just feelings are
[1:26:30] good and you know watch you walk
[1:26:31] yourself right into
[1:26:37] healing instead of doing that sometimes
[1:26:40] I have to say why you acting so
[1:26:43] grumpy and he looks at me and say I say
[1:26:45] it to him a a lot of y'all ain't going
[1:26:47] to say that
[1:26:51] to
[1:26:53] he look at me and he said brother Dale
[1:26:54] just keep preaching until I get
[1:26:57] it help me get delivered from
[1:27:01] myself that's right
[1:27:05] healing see we don't
[1:27:10] die we have Divine Healing as the
[1:27:13] earnest of our Immortal bodies which is
[1:27:16] coming on that's in that same one
[1:27:18] fundamental foundation for
[1:27:21] faith
[1:27:23] you want an immortal body get in the
[1:27:26] word right Walk In The
[1:27:30] Word these other things will take care
[1:27:32] of itself we walk right into a change of
[1:27:34] the
[1:27:35] body amen that's right and I don't
[1:27:38] believe it's like brother Mo used to
[1:27:39] ustr he said you run like going up a
[1:27:41] ladder you know well you don't don't do
[1:27:42] it you're going to get hurt don't run
[1:27:43] into a ladder and jump about three runs
[1:27:45] up you know and take all no just take
[1:27:47] one
[1:27:49] step brother how you sure don't want to
[1:27:51] come down of Miss some of them do you
[1:27:54] you're going to get hurt just take one
[1:27:56] step at a time right
[1:27:59] man let's just walk in the word as God
[1:28:01] reveals it that's right you know why
[1:28:04] because we'll be ready for the
[1:28:06] change because it's going to be revealed
[1:28:08] to us that we're
[1:28:11] changed all right and when it's revealed
[1:28:13] to us that we're
[1:28:16] changed we'll stand here and just go
[1:28:19] right on this is happy to be here but
[1:28:23] we'll know it's over
[1:28:25] right cuz I'm talking about the
[1:28:27] Redemption of to Wi to understand the
[1:28:31] Redemption
[1:28:34] amen not to just get
[1:28:38] changed that's a simple thing then Here
[1:28:41] Comes brother Rand along what conduct
[1:28:43] order and
[1:28:45] Doctrine he said what's the change he
[1:28:47] said just a
[1:28:48] change amen that's what he said
[1:28:52] right around I ask you a question he
[1:28:54] said and I answered
[1:28:56] it it's just a
[1:29:00] change he said your glorified body is
[1:29:03] being built around your Born Again
[1:29:05] experience
[1:29:08] amen y he said the same way that it was
[1:29:11] in
[1:29:12] Mary what just forming a baby as she
[1:29:17] ate what do you think about
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:23] what do you think about it but I just
[1:29:25] want to be changed well
[1:29:28] let let's believe in Divine Healing
[1:29:31] too
[1:29:33] amen let's get Divine Healing
[1:29:36] right who was it one of the men one of
[1:29:39] the Great Men asked about BR said
[1:29:40] something about and he said you know he
[1:29:43] said no he said go sit down under that
[1:29:46] talking about brother BOS the old old
[1:29:47] tree he said go and sit down under him
[1:29:49] and sit there a while then later on he
[1:29:51] referred about it he said I look at him
[1:29:53] and see he said I spent all this
[1:29:55] struggle in my Ministry and trying to
[1:29:58] get people to believe he said he just
[1:29:59] takes the word and just tie Satan in
[1:30:01] such a knot till Satan cannot do it he
[1:30:04] said people are
[1:30:05] healed you don't ever listen to
[1:30:10] that how are we healed by the revealed
[1:30:13] word god reveals to you that you're
[1:30:16] heal then you just step into it come on
[1:30:19] brother then you just step right over
[1:30:21] into it
[1:30:27] so my concern is what to Wi to
[1:30:32] understand the Redemption of this body
[1:30:36] there's my adoption right cuz you see
[1:30:39] you'll catch on real quick that the
[1:30:42] three stages of adoption that I've been
[1:30:44] talking about doesn't end with a
[1:30:47] change that's
[1:30:50] right that is is the completion
[1:30:54] yeah but the third stage of adoption is
[1:30:58] to get the understanding that you're
[1:31:02] redeemed right a lot of difference in
[1:31:04] the two now you better consider that
[1:31:05] statement I just made that's a message
[1:31:08] on down the
[1:31:10] road the to get the Revelation that
[1:31:14] you're redeemed right there is your
[1:31:16] adoption that Paul was speaking
[1:31:20] of the redemp to understand the
[1:31:24] Redemption there's never been a day to
[1:31:26] understand it to this day let's go ahead
