[4:57] the potion that we have need to hear
[4:59] this state in Jesus Christ's name we
[5:01] pray amen
[5:04] Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no
[5:11] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[5:13] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[5:16] after the spirit for what the law could
[5:28] not do in that it was weak through the
[5:32] flesh God sending his own son in the
[5:34] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[5:37] condemned sin in the flesh
[5:50] are they that are after the flesh do
[5:54] mind the things of the flesh but they
[5:56] that are after the spirit the things of
[5:59] the Spirit because the carnal man is
[6:11] empty against God for it is not subject
[6:14] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[6:20] [Music]
[6:23] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[6:27] spirit it be that the Spirit of God
[6:31] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[6:35] Spirit of Christ he is none of his but
[6:49] if the spirit of him that raised up
[6:52] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[6:55] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[6:57] also quicken tomorrow' body by his
[7:00] spirit that dwelleth in you for if you
[7:12] live after the flesh you shall die but
[7:16] if through the spirit do more to modify
[7:21] the deeds of the body ye shall live
[7:26] [Music]
[7:30] but if you have not received the spirit
[7:33] abundant against to fear but you have
[7:36] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[7:39] we cry Abba Father
[7:49] and if tchard then heirs of God and
[7:55] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[7:59] have suffered with him that we may also

[10:33] 16 while you're turning there I want to
[10:40] make an announcement that so kind of a
[10:43] weird announcements to make but there
[10:45] was a brother sent some money to the
[10:47] church
[10:48] all right to help the people that lost
[10:52] anything during the time like food etc
[10:55] during the time of this last storm and
[10:59] he wanted it to be passed out among the
[11:01] people you know if anybody had lost
[11:04] anything like you you know your
[11:06] refrigerator didn't get keeping and you
[11:09] lost like that not just because we're
[11:12] paying for a refrigerator that quit
[11:14] three months ago you know and then
[11:17] you're coming up and say no it's just
[11:19] something to were that we're the brother
[11:21] sent some money and desired that it be
[11:23] divided among the people and we
[11:26] appreciate him for doing that to her if
[11:29] anybody lost anything then please go to
[11:32] Terrence and let him know and they'll
[11:35] try to take care of the pet and then
[11:38] what if there's anything left over
[11:40] it will just roll over in to the what we
[11:43] call the widows fund it's a fund that we
[11:46] have to set up you know and you said it
[11:49] if I didn't and set it up to where that
[11:51] you could help people that were real
[11:53] needy and everything you know to get
[11:56] through problems or whatever and all it
[11:59] was set up that way so okay so remember
[12:01] that in doing that ruse may get this
[12:04] other one - sister Monica's class will
[12:06] meet at 12:45 to practice also today so
[12:10] I father we thank you for your grace and
[12:13] your love we thank you for everything we
[12:16] pray that you would just bless us with
[12:18] your presence in your love and your
[12:20] understanding this day among each and
[12:23] every one of us we appreciate you Lord
[12:25] and your loving your grace and we pray
[12:27] that you would just help us to walk
[12:30] upright in you and to see you Lord
[12:33] living among us as we read your word we
[12:36] pray that you would come forth and open
[12:39] that word to give us an understanding
[12:41] and we just appreciate every time we
[12:44] love you and we thank you we commit it
[12:46] to you now in Jesus name the scripture
[12:52] reading out and then we'll go on into
[12:54] the rest of the service okay John 1:1
[12:58] says in the beginning was the word and
[13:01] the Word was with God and the Word was
[13:03] God
[13:04] now remember how we're bringing it it's
[13:07] not in the beginning
[13:08] something with God thought it says and
[13:12] the Word was God
[13:13] so that's self-explanatory the same was
[13:16] in the beginning with God all things
[13:18] were made by him and without him was not
[13:21] anything made that was made
[13:23] in him was life and the life was the
[13:25] light of men
[13:26] and the light shining in darkness and
[13:28] the darkness comprehended it not now we
[13:32] know for sure - we will be going to
[13:34] verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and
[13:37] dwelt among us because that way we'll be
[13:40] declaring who we're talking about all
[13:43] right so let's go now to Matthew 16 and
[13:49] we'll start with verse 13 when Jesus
[13:52] came into the coasts of Sicily
[13:54] Philip I he asked his disciples saying
[13:56] whom do men say that I the Son of Man
[14:00] a.m. and they said some say that thou
[14:02] art John the Baptist some Elias and
[14:05] others Jeremias or one of the prophets
[14:07] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[14:11] I am and Simon Peter answered and
[14:14] answered and said thou art the Christ
[14:18] the Son of the Living God in jesus
[14:22] answered and said unto him blessed art
[14:25] thou simon barjona for flesh and blood
[14:27] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[14:31] father which is in heaven and i say also
[14:33] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[14:37] this rock I will build my church and the
[14:39] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[14:42] it and it's built on the revelation what
[14:46] the revelation of Jesus Christ and who
[14:49] he is
[14:50] once then and I will give unto thee the
[14:53] keys of the kingdom of heaven and
[14:55] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[14:57] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[14:59] show whatsoever thou shalt loose on
[15:03] earth shall be loosed in heaven amen to
[15:07] the word you may be seated
[15:08] and if we'll bring up the little one
[15:11] she's already been up here some of you
[15:13] were down stars and you didn't see she's
[15:16] already made her trip up here to the
[15:18] front and so you know it's not on the
[15:22] videos I don't think or anything but she
[15:25] came up here with Terence to open the
[15:27] service so then she's a good little girl
[15:30] she hasn't been crying or doing anything
[15:32] she's been real good and we thank God
[15:35] for the little one right amen and that
[15:38] way we can get her around and get some
[15:41] pictures and all so go ahead go ahead
[15:45] brother and pick some pictures and then
[15:49] we'll get into the dedication part of
[15:52] the little one and out maka and Mary
[15:58] with us today
[15:59] and to bring the little one for us all
[16:02] to see her we've seen a lot of pictures
[16:04] over and all like that but we get to see
[16:08] her today hey little one
[16:11] let's see let's see if you're gonna let
[16:14] me hold you now are you gonna let me
[16:16] hold you
[16:17] okay well that back there hey you see
[16:20] all of them people yeah okay now what do
[16:24] we always do what do we say we come
[16:27] because we don't leave in in everybody
[16:31] stand we don't believe in infant
[16:34] baptisms no nothing like that
[16:35] we don't go with that but we believe the
[16:37] Bible said they brought him to Jesus and
[16:39] He blessed them gave them back to the
[16:41] family to raise some that honor so
[16:43] that's what we all do here we all stand
[16:46] together to show that we're gonna stay
[16:49] with this little one to see that she
[16:51] gets an opportunity to be raised right
[16:53] and everything because that's the way
[16:56] it's supposed to be grandma grandpa all
[16:59] the others everywhere they're supposed
[17:01] to live before the child in a way that
[17:04] the child can see Jesus Christ they mean
[17:06] and she's doing good she's not crying
[17:09] none whatsoever but that way we're all
[17:12] dedicating ourselves to the raising of
[17:16] the child no matter what then you think
[17:18] about all of us being in that part so
[17:21] what is her name
[17:24] Charlotte scarlet I'm bad of hearing so
[17:29] forgive me but see I'd all them people

[17:40] opportunity of holding a little product
[17:44] of you that you're allowed into the
[17:46] family of our brother and sister that

[18:34] of them are crying and everything okay
[18:36] you can go ahead and be seen but we
[18:39] appreciate it appreciate an opportunity
[18:41] I always do too you know to dedicate a
[18:45] child unto the Lord because as I said we
[18:49] don't we don't go with infant baptisms
[18:52] or anything like that but we simply go
[18:55] with the Word of God that says that
[18:58] they're doing and you can be seated
[18:59] all right now so just remember that you
[19:06] dedicated your life to live before this

[19:13] Christ because you're the one that's
[19:15] gonna heat that she's gonna see doing
[19:18] and we just we appreciate that we shake
[19:20] the little one that God would give her

[20:36] and try to follow along listen to the
[20:41] things and and watch and you know if you
[20:44] miss a service get the tape and listen
[20:47] of the service we make them for you if
[20:49] you need an mp3 a CD or our DVDs or
[20:54] whatever you need listen to them and and
[20:59] try to understand now I say it like this
[21:02] you say well do we need to understand
[21:04] the seals well as Wade was in impressing
[21:09] Darr winds dr laying it down real strong
[21:12] the seals is the complete plan of
[21:14] redemption
[21:15] now would you not want to know the plan
[21:18] of redemption well we know the plan of
[21:20] redemption all it is you got to be born
[21:22] again well now we've been in that for a
[21:25] long time and like wait for this
[21:26] emphasizing you know we say well all we
[21:30] need is just simple messages we just
[21:33] need something simple to to abide we
[21:35] need to do this and we don't need these
[21:37] deep things we'll wanted the Prophet
[21:39] preaching why was it written in the
[21:40] Bible that's as plain as I can say it
[21:42] and blunt as I can say and see I don't
[21:45] understand why people do not want to
[21:48] follow the prophets message he said on
[21:50] the daniel seventy weeks he said if you
[21:52] don't understand the Daniel 7 dude he
[21:54] said you can't understand the seal now I
[21:57] didn't say that
[21:59] wait won't say that it's the Prophet
[22:01] that says it all right he said well I
[22:03] don't understand that same to Israel
[22:05] well then why don't you make yourself
[22:08] available the tapes are on the internet
[22:11] there's our for you you can listen you
[22:14] can go back as much as 74 and see a lot
[22:18] of things back through dark coming down
[22:20] in the 80s and I let alone something now
[22:23] like our listener yeah you've been here
[22:25] 57 years since the Prophet had and you
[22:28] ain't moved one step that's blond
[22:34] but that's flying where you moved one
[22:38] step where's it stepped up any what are
[22:41] we looking for some magic something to
[22:43] happen I went to God those things would
[22:47] be there but I can't do and if it did
[22:49] happen if it was to be something was to
[22:54] take place the Prophet was to come back
[22:56] something was to happen this was AB you
[22:58] realize there's got to be a foundation
[23:02] in the people that are here to
[23:05] understand we've had 50 years to study
[23:09] the message waiting if you're waiting on
[23:12] something to happen you've had 50 years
[23:14] to study the message I have no problems
[23:18] we're talking about the seals and the
[23:20] thunders and I because I have done I
[23:23] have tried to make myself available to
[23:25] the Lord where he could speak about it
[23:27] but just remember see you say do we need
[23:30] these things now if we want to all go by
[23:34] the grave and keep on going but this
[23:38] message is the complete plan of
[23:39] redemption and there is a change of the
[23:42] body involved right see then something's
[23:47] got to happen to change the body and see
[23:52] then that's supposed to be to work that
[23:54] we can see those things see all right
[23:57] then we'd say do we need it no if we
[24:02] won't stay here I've been said those
[24:06] things people have said brother Dale
[24:08] just repeats itself repeats itself you
[24:12] know who that's far you that said I
[24:16] repeat myself you are the one that I'm
[24:21] repeating it far is that blunt enough
[24:28] that way we're not playing with anything
[24:31] we're trying to be serious about it do
[24:35] we need these things no if we want to go
[24:38] by the grave we can just keep on going
[24:40] but somebody's going to come to a change
[24:43] of the body
[24:44] well and if they don't come to the
[24:47] Chinese somebody don't come to the
[24:48] change of the body remember they without
[24:51] us cannot be made perfect just remember
[24:54] everything is waiting on somebody well
[24:57] when are we gonna get serious enough to
[24:59] study the message and listen to the
[25:02] message
[25:03] I study the message I do this I didn't
[25:06] want hi but is it being revealed can you
[25:12] swallow the truth whether it be my
[25:16] family the church whoever I'm talking to
[25:22] we say do we need deeper things no if we
[25:27] want to go by the grave we don't need
[25:28] them but if we want an opportunity to
[25:32] make a change of the body then why did
[25:35] the Prophet bring the message if it's
[25:38] not to be understood is that straight
[25:43] enough I don't understand this I don't
[25:46] understand it you ever made yourself
[25:48] available you're asking anybody else do
[25:51] you understand this no I listen to
[25:54] nobody else with me that's the way it
[25:56] goes you're cutting yourself off all
[25:59] right you're going by the grade all of
[26:04] us are going by the grave and you know
[26:06] we're getting old enough until it's
[26:07] getting pretty fast for most of us you
[26:09] know I mean it's just about fiest enough
[26:12] to do we need to go ahead and order some
[26:14] some caskets and buy some food plot I
[26:17] mean a food plot bison
[26:21] get your life buy some grape lunch get
[26:27] your life to get you away from that
[26:29] Stern this is your setting that we're
[26:31] all right so we've gone in with the rest
[26:32] of the messages but do we need anything
[26:34] do we need these things is it necessary
[26:39] to say the same things over again Paul
[26:42] seems to say so when he said did it his
[26:45] need for me to repeat these times see it
[26:52] must be for somebody okay now we have
[26:55] been for quite a while speaking about in
[26:58] trying to understand how that God
[27:06] condescended to mankind and how that he
[27:10] begin to create and to bring things into
[27:13] being and he began to condescend down to
[27:17] were that we could understand him right
[27:21] because he knew we would not be able to
[27:23] understand but yet he condescended to
[27:29] reveal himself to make himself known
[27:32] what was his purpose to come down and
[27:35] live with you and I to fellowship with
[27:39] us you mean God is that well where's he
[27:42] at I mean you know were there he wants
[27:48] to fellowship and the very word God in
[27:52] the English language you look it up it
[27:54] simply means an object of worship so
[27:59] then to understand God is to understand
[28:02] what it means about worship and how that
[28:06] we worship Him and serve Him and you
[28:09] remember there was it the lady at the
[28:12] well she said we worship we don't you
[28:16] know you you're talking about something
[28:18] different in other words we worship this
[28:21] way that way and said you're talking
[28:23] about something different he wasn't
[28:24] talking about just himself all he's
[28:26] talking about because he came for the
[28:29] purpose of revealing himself to make
[28:32] himself known
[28:33] - you and I why would we not want to
[28:37] know more about God why would you know I
[28:46] like something happened the other day we
[28:48] gots to tickle about it but anyhow you
[28:51] know you get all upset with people when
[28:52] they say something like I just got
[28:54] through saying well then just remember
[28:57] to get upset is not the Holy Spirit now
[29:01] don't tell me your righteous indignation
[29:03] I'm 77 years old let's don't talk about
[29:06] righteous indignation I like what one
[29:10] brother said and there's two brothers
[29:11] here at the church one time and they
[29:13] were just arguing like everything and
[29:15] they both got up said we're not arguing
[29:18] this other brother he said well you know
[29:22] said you might not call it argan but
[29:24] said both of you got mad and we didn't
[29:27] get mad he said well that's the way I
[29:29] hatch when I get mad you know I just
[29:32] like the way you're acting so then you
[29:35] get upset what about what somebody
[29:36] brings the truth to you then you know
[29:39] for certain you're not right is that
[29:42] black I don't play I don't kid when I
[29:47] come here I'm outside of here I might
[29:49] talk with you but when I'm here it's
[29:52] straight I talked the way that I believe
[29:54] the Lord would want it to be said and I
[29:56] believe he wants us to have an
[29:58] understanding of him and His Word and
[30:02] why would we not want to do that then
[30:06] what would be the part what would you
[30:07] not want to know more about God you mean
[30:12] he created you and you don't want to
[30:13] know him much about and that's beyond me
[30:21] okay let's go on listen now we found out
[30:25] by studying the scriptures bringing it
[30:28] through the Word of God how there's I
[30:31] said God condescended downward to work
[30:36] he could make us you know to be a book
[30:39] to understanding and to see him do it
[30:42] the creation itself as I was describing
[30:46] they're alive Sunday afternoon the
[30:48] creation itself declares the Almighty
[30:51] God the Bible says that even the eternal
[30:56] Godhead is understood by the things that
[31:00] we see right you go out of the yard and
[31:06] you pick up a blade of grass and you
[31:08] pull it up and you ask the scientists
[31:11] how that lives and what it is we get God
[31:15] by justice struggle his hand created
[31:17] those things yeah brought all of that
[31:19] into being you tell me all these trees
[31:21] and all the things and then you tell me
[31:23] that God didn't he put in those treason
[31:27] and and flowers and and herbs etc he put
[31:33] in them medicine right because he knew
[31:40] we would need it so he put in the trees
[31:43] that's all folks we we know a little bit
[31:46] about it don't we what to call it
[31:48] xfinity the different things you hung
[31:50] around your neck you know people I've
[31:52] made fun but you know what we lived
[31:54] right they see because God put those
[31:58] things down as he created he put the
[32:02] healing factor right into the to the
[32:06] very thing that you would need and you
[32:10] just go out and you like a dog and he
[32:12] gets sick you go get some Grayson you
[32:17] know how to do it make you throw up and
[32:18] they can do that you know how to do it
[32:20] there's herbs out there for everything
[32:23] we have need of you when we was kids and
[32:32] you got to coughing mom you ought to do
[32:36] she takes some kerosene and drop it over
[32:38] some sugar and slam it in your mouth and
[32:41] make you swallow of it well you know
[32:43] either you either it stopped you from
[32:46] coughing or you got where you wouldn't
[32:47] go cough no more because you knew if you
[32:49] caught it again you're gonna get another
[32:51] dose of it so one way or the other it
[32:53] stops you from coughing
[32:55] right you see God put an immune system
[33:00] into a human being
[33:01] in the garden as he developed a man and
[33:05] brought him in he put an immune system
[33:07] did not the body of Adam come out of the
[33:10] ground but the words God took the dirt
[33:14] for it stepped he just stepped into it
[33:17] he put had him into the to that flash
[33:21] you know what out of that is the beans
[33:23] and the taters and the corn and the
[33:25] herbs and the medicine and everything
[33:28] that you have need of to live the
[33:32] deterioration of mankind the mixing and
[33:35] mingling the the things of those order
[33:39] wound up breaking down our immune system
[33:41] which you're still what was it the guy
[33:47] was looking trying to figure out how
[33:49] that they were people dying of all kind
[33:50] of things and then he looked at an
[33:54] orange and he saw the mold it was on the
[33:57] orange he took that off and begin to do
[34:01] things with it and you know it worked
[34:05] God had everything there for us when he
[34:07] created that's what I told Matt last
[34:09] week that in the creation in the
[34:13] creation God put everything there for us
[34:17] to look at so that the the Bible would
[34:19] say that even the eternal Godhead could
[34:22] be understood by the things that we see
[34:28] and then why you're saying what I just
[34:30] don't see God you just don't know how to
[34:33] look you don't know how to look you can
[34:39] take this to blade of grass and look at
[34:41] it who created it what brought it and
[34:47] you just see the eternal God revealing
[34:51] himself okay that was the point I was
[34:53] trying to get to last week saying that
[34:55] what God created all things alright we
[35:00] went to the Bible talking about that
[35:02] Genesis one and one says God you know
[35:05] created the world huh
[35:07] you get on over a little
[35:09] since God created or made man you come a
[35:13] little further and it would say God as
[35:14] we went through like Melek island
[35:17] different thing I believe was the one
[35:18] work he said did not one God create us
[35:22] God is the Creator God right he's to
[35:27] create Torah because he's God we don't
[35:32] believe in a Trinitarian concept of a
[35:34] Father Son and Holy Ghost no because
[35:38] that's not even correct there's no such
[35:41] thing in the Bible showed me the word
[35:43] Trinity in the Bible anymore and I'll
[35:46] quit preaching that's just the best way
[35:48] to say it if you'd like me to stop
[35:50] preaching come show me cause you can't
[35:53] show me but yet God is so real
[35:58] and so wonderful until he made it to
[36:01] where we could understand here by
[36:04] looking around us the little baby that
[36:08] now your old timers know that what I'm
[36:11] saying is true this one the baby before
[36:13] the immune systems begin to break down
[36:15] so much you know a baby used to be
[36:17] almost immune to sicknesses because of
[36:20] the mother's breast and the milk and the
[36:22] things that it was eating and the things
[36:25] that was in it for six months or a year
[36:28] but then things started deteriorating in
[36:32] breaking down the immune systems and
[36:36] then baby started dying like everything
[36:38] why because of the sin curse in the
[36:41] garden that man sinned and went wrong
[36:45] but look God Himself the Great Creator
[36:55] condescended to earth to let him to
[37:01] associate with his people to fellowship
[37:07] with his people what about a wonderful
[37:12] God like that
[37:16] see then we read that this great one
[37:22] that created we read there and John that
[37:27] he created all things everything was
[37:33] created was created by him we went to
[37:36] Colossians 1 in 16 where in him all
[37:40] things were created in heaven and are in
[37:44] Earth were created by him and the Bible
[37:48] says for him the Great Creator we sing
[37:54] about became my Savior
[37:56] just think about it he didn't send
[37:59] another person down to die for you and I
[38:02] he came himself would you send one of
[38:05] your children in your place in other
[38:09] words you got a date to set the dial and
[38:11] they say well Wow and he's one person
[38:12] ok sorry about that son you now that
[38:16] wouldn't be a good mother nor father
[38:18] would it now we'd go ourselves and see
[38:21] that's the way God was he came himself
[38:23] to earth and as he condescended the way
[38:29] he condescended was the most wonderful
[38:31] situation that could ever be because he
[38:35] condescended downward to first be a
[38:38] creator and that was the word that was
[38:44] in the beginning we read was the word
[38:46] the Word was with God and the Word was
[38:49] God who created all things the word so
[38:54] God condescended from the form of being
[38:56] supernatural to not be able to
[38:59] understand him but following he begin to
[39:02] come down word towards man and his first
[39:05] form was the word and the word started
[39:10] creating he said let there be and there
[39:13] was who was that Almighty God God
[39:18] created all things alright but then we
[39:22] drop on down into the word and we begin
[39:24] to follow it to following it to where
[39:26] John we're speaking about some
[39:28] than about this person and then he said
[39:32] you know verse 14 there in john and the
[39:37] word became flesh and dwelt among us god
[39:43] himself according to the bible there in
[39:47] Matthew where it says and he shall call
[39:48] his name Emmanuel because it's my
[39:51] interpretation saying God with us but
[40:00] think about it God with us laying in a
[40:06] cradle so we can't look at it that away
[40:12] Kenley but that was the mystery that was
[40:17] the thing that has baffled all mankind
[40:19] how that the great eternal God could
[40:22] condescend solo until he would be laying
[40:26] in a cradle
[40:28] crying he would be a little boy out
[40:33] playing in about 13 he would come up and
[40:38] somewhere in there and he would face
[40:40] those Pharisees and things and confound
[40:42] them with his wisdom they were amazed at
[40:47] the things he could say why because that
[40:49] was God himself then he comes on up into
[40:54] life and he he goes out into a ministry
[40:57] there and and he's baptized by John and
[40:59] the river and he enters a ministry who
[41:01] God Himself said you believe that was
[41:04] God now you tell me it wouldn't because
[41:09] you're not listening to what I'm talking
[41:11] about see if we believe that God never
[41:15] changes according to Malachi 3 said I'm
[41:18] God and I change not we'll see then he
[41:20] couldn't change but he can change the
[41:25] way he's doing things he can in more fee
[41:30] the word says to change in form like one
[41:33] person playing many many parts in a
[41:35] movie or something and that god himself
[41:40] could come down to
[41:41] anton and could stand there and he said
[41:45] unless you believe them i quoting
[41:47] scripture Girija bible he said unless
[41:49] you believe that I am he you will die in
[41:51] your sins he said I and my father are
[41:57] one
[41:59] did you say there's two of them why do
[42:02] we want to make two or three out of it
[42:04] he said if you're not quoting scriptures
[42:07] if you want him I'll be glad to run him
[42:08] I'll read you Bible you'll find he said
[42:11] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[42:18] well because that was the condescending
[42:20] of God downward to where he could make
[42:26] himself manifest and see then the Bible
[42:30] said he's called in the son of God
[42:36] Romans 1 and 4 as he's declared to be
[42:41] the son God with power and signs and
[42:43] wonders and it said even the
[42:45] resurrection he was declared to be the
[42:49] son of the Living God that's why when he
[42:52] when Matthew was asked the question says
[42:54] who the man say i the son of man am what
[42:57] did he say he said thou art the Christ
[43:00] the Son of the Living God what I like is
[43:04] the other part of you said well that was
[43:05] just a statement he was making now the
[43:07] Bible goes on to say what he said I am
[43:15] the one that condescended downward to
[43:21] where you are now and what can you call
[43:24] me and Peter called the revelation right
[43:29] by the Holy Spirit that thou art the
[43:33] Christ the Son of the Living God what is
[43:38] a son of God a son of God is simply in
[43:44] terminology as we use is call him an
[43:46] offspring would you know what it takes
[43:51] to bring a son of God into the world
[43:53] naturally or a daughter either way
[43:55] you know what it takes it takes a lot of
[43:59] years to bring mom and daddy into the
[44:02] world it takes a lot of years they've
[44:04] brought Grandma and Grandpa into the
[44:06] world and then down through all of that
[44:10] the genetic makeup would be coming down
[44:13] to were that that child when it would
[44:15] stand on earth then you would say this
[44:19] is James Cawley a son and it would
[44:24] college mom and daddy's name why because
[44:27] you could prove it by the DNA cuz he's
[44:31] our son off there every what if mom and
[44:33] daddy is my mom and my dad my mother was
[44:36] handed me my dad was Sam and that's all
[44:41] they know about him this is Sam Dale so
[44:43] I guess us that's the best way to say it
[44:46] he was just Sam Dale you know what DNA
[44:51] can prove who you belong to it can prove
[44:54] who your mother and daddy is why because
[44:58] the DNA covers your genetic makeup as
[45:02] coming down
[45:03] well I why would it not be that God as
[45:07] he could condescend would he not leave
[45:10] the greatest DNA situation through life
[45:12] and through the Bible that mankind could
[45:15] look through the Bible and see that DNA
[45:17] and following down and see God see him
[45:22] appearing to Moses at a burning bush he
[45:25] said Moses I am that I am and see him
[45:30] declaring who he was to Moses see him
[45:34] declared in the fiery furnace with the
[45:38] three Hebrew children and even the king
[45:41] of ether and King looked in and said
[45:43] he's got to be this on a garden all the
[45:47] way down through those I was trying to
[45:49] get you to see here while back we could
[45:51] follow the Spirit of God through the Old
[45:53] Testament but can we follow the very
[45:55] soul or nature or person of Almighty God
[45:58] who was that standing there as I tried
[46:00] to express to you in that prophet that
[46:03] David himself declared his own
[46:05] destruction when he was when he said
[46:08] had you repealed to take Bathsheba and
[46:13] there he was declaring through that
[46:20] prophet David himself declared he said
[46:24] that man will die that does that the
[46:26] king I mean the the prophet didn't say
[46:28] well it's no no no hold on no he
[46:30] immediately said but you won't die David
[46:34] he said cause I prayed for you
[46:37] who was that back there who was that
[46:41] Christ followed throughout the Old
[46:43] Testament who was that one that would
[46:47] finally come as I said into flesh then
[46:49] and Peter would declare him to be the
[46:51] Christ and who is the Christ the creator
[46:55] god no no Christ is just the anointing
[46:59] okay follow the anointing all the way
[47:01] back then you'll go back to anointing
[47:03] you back up to work that you got to find
[47:05] out someone knowings got to come from
[47:06] something and for that's come from
[47:08] something that's got a voice that's why
[47:13] I've tried my best to get you to see you
[47:15] would it be any problem for us to look
[47:17] if we believe that Hoffman's head of
[47:22] Christ as the closest thing to Jesus
[47:24] Christ well then would you have any
[47:26] trouble to see him standing back down in
[47:29] that form and saying let there be
[47:32] let there be see we don't want to look
[47:35] at God as being real we want to look at
[47:36] him as some kind of a spirit or some
[47:38] kind of something that that's not
[47:39] tangible enough for us to associate with
[47:44] it but there he was in human flesh and
[47:49] Peter caught the revelation to art the
[47:51] Christ the Son of the Living God what
[47:53] did Jesus say flesh and blood never
[47:54] revealed that under the Peter in other
[47:57] words I didn't reveal that to you by my
[47:59] own flesh he said what my father
[48:01] revealed that and said upon that rock of
[48:04] who you declared Christ to be the church
[48:09] is going to be built right
[48:12] the church is to be built on Jesus
[48:15] Christ and who is he he's the word now
[48:20] you don't have any trouble with John 1
[48:21] then do you
[48:25] why can't you read it this way in the
[48:27] beginning was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[48:31] was with Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ
[48:33] was Jesus Christ you want it from the
[48:36] Prophet I'll give it to you right off
[48:37] the tape from him he said it says
[48:39] original says are the understanding that
[48:42] said in the beginning with Elohim Elohim
[48:45] was with God and Elohim was God and
[48:47] Elohim was made flesh and dwelt among us
[48:50] Elohim means the self existing God the
[48:55] great eternal what are we going to
[48:57] believe it and accept what the message
[49:00] that had been brought unto us in this
[49:01] last days to see God and see how real he
[49:04] is to you and I and they're not to just
[49:07] think about what is just the spirit we
[49:09] can't see him no we can't see him and
[49:15] then we open our eyes you can't see by
[49:19] by keeping your eyes close to the truth
[49:22] trying said what I said well ago why
[49:24] don't we want to understand the sealed
[49:25] the Daniel seventy weeks the imagined
[49:27] divorce not the the future home the the
[49:31] thing why would we not want the message
[49:37] well you're throwing that at me hey did
[49:43] you get it I throwed it right at you
[49:47] that goes to everybody in the building
[49:52] why because like I said when I'm here
[49:55] I'm gonna tell it like it is you say we
[49:58] don't need these mysteries then we've
[50:00] been here 54 years why has there not
[50:05] been a rapture
[50:07] well we're waiting on okay let's get
[50:11] prepared yeah that's all I've ever said
[50:14] you can't accuse me of anything else but
[50:17] saying one thing if you're gonna catch
[50:20] an airplane don't go up to Gainesville
[50:23] to the bus depot to wait on an airplane
[50:25] it won't come back you go or the plane
[50:30] is that you go with our poor to that
[50:33] you get where the word is that and you
[50:35] stay with it well I just couldn't
[50:38] understand why have you ever asked God
[50:42] to reveal the word to you I mean if you
[50:48] ever asked him to simply reveal himself
[50:50] to you he might stop of that a lot of
[50:53] that we don't need this we don't need
[50:55] that is it true ask him to reveal
[51:03] himself to remember upon this rock this
[51:08] revelation of who Jesus Christ is the
[51:12] church was built well if it was built by
[51:16] that it's gonna be capped off by that if
[51:19] he's capped off by the revelation of
[51:21] Jesus Christ it's gonna be changed by
[51:22] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[51:24] so what are we looking for what are the
[51:28] seals to reveal Jesus Christ what is
[51:31] Daniel seventy weeks to reveal Jesus
[51:32] Christ but all the people won't his
[51:35] dates and times and seasons and they try
[51:36] to figure this out in front of me
[51:37] and they know they can't do it and they
[51:39] go haywire so they don't get to think
[51:41] right around him on what he said if you
[51:43] don't know future home the greatest
[51:45] message of talking about a city coming
[51:47] he said if you don't get the plan of
[51:49] redemption it's in the future now he was
[51:55] talking about a future home but he said
[51:57] if you don't get to plan a Redemption
[51:58] don't cross the mystery said if you miss
[52:01] it come back to this message and the way
[52:06] I love the cross the mystery of God
[52:07] revealed brother Brown said that Christ
[52:09] could be revealed to the most illiterate
[52:12] person could it be than a most
[52:16] illiterate person could get it no so
[52:18] educated ones missing what about it
[52:23] I'm just being plain trying to get
[52:25] something to you so when he was here on
[52:28] earth he kept declaring the fact that he
[52:32] was the son of man right
[52:35] Jesus kept the car and that he was the
[52:38] son of man uh-huh
[52:40] but then when he comes to Peter he said
[52:44] who the man say that I the Son of man I
[52:46] am
[52:51] Peter said darn the Christ the Son of
[52:55] the Living God what didn't you say I
[53:00] didn't ask you that question I asked you
[53:03] who the son of man was because he knew
[53:07] he couldn't build a church upon what he
[53:08] was talking about at that time so what
[53:11] did he do he said dark the Christ the
[53:13] Son of the Living God he said amen to
[53:14] that he said I didn't I didn't even make
[53:17] that known to you of my own flesh he
[53:20] said what the father's revealed that and
[53:22] said upon that I'll build my church the
[53:25] church wasn't built on the son of man
[53:26] the church was built on the Son of God
[53:29] and who he was
[53:30] capito was simply declaring if he was
[53:33] declaring him to be the Christ Christ
[53:36] means The Anointed One right the
[53:39] Anointed Messiah he was declaring him to
[53:42] be the very creator that created the
[53:45] world and that's why we went through the
[53:53] scriptures then proven what did it say
[53:55] we got over into Ephesians 3:9 and it
[53:58] says what who created all things how by
[54:04] Jesus Christ who created all things God
[54:10] created all thing yeah but you sound
[54:12] like now you got a Trinity going no no
[54:14] you just hold on this that's where it
[54:16] trouble is we try to figure things out
[54:18] and it doesn't work the way we trying to
[54:19] figure it out we get all upset about it
[54:22] the Bible plainly declares the church
[54:26] the son of God the New Testament by the
[54:31] church is built upon the revelation of
[54:33] the Son of God and him being the Christ
[54:36] the very creator of all things and the
[54:40] Bible would say in him dwelleth the
[54:42] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[54:50] but it would declare him to be the
[54:54] create car
[54:56] we just can't think about that little
[54:59] baby laying in the cradle well who was
[55:01] running the world while the baby was
[55:02] leaning great more that's smart and all
[55:07] that God had to do before the world ever
[55:08] begun will speak one word and say let it
[55:10] be this way until I come back then we'll
[55:12] change it and that kept it going well
[55:15] who wakes up the Sun every morning I do
[55:17] that's what my wife says
[55:22] she said honey you don't have to get up
[55:25] and wake up the Sun it'll come up I said
[55:27] well that's all right
[55:29] no the older I'm getting the less I'm
[55:31] getting up so maybe I'm learning
[55:34] something but listen church trying to
[55:38] describe one thing to either life Sunday
[55:41] see Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[55:43] three gods the Bible says the eternal
[55:46] Godhead can be understood by the things
[55:47] that we see I'm a human being
[55:50] right you're a human being you're a
[55:54] mother you're a father you're a son or a
[55:59] daughter so anybody in here take anybody
[56:05] sisters brother than anybody and you can
[56:07] declare the God here that's being right
[56:10] there before you how many people are
[56:12] they of you not simple in it well see
[56:17] that's too simple you see what we call
[56:20] simple is not deep think deep things is
[56:25] what simple the deeper thing you get the
[56:32] more simple it gets there's not the
[56:38] pyramid come higher and higher up to a
[56:40] point the word that is razor Shawn it's
[56:44] simple
[56:45] we'll see we tried to figure it out
[56:47] instead of believing it and saying god
[56:50] help me reveal this to me I know for
[56:54] years it brother they have been
[56:56] preaching one God to us to see that
[56:58] there's not no three gods who created
[57:02] who
[57:06] let's just gotta be it's a father-son
[57:08] hold ago called my preacher said that
[57:10] let go let your preacher something show
[57:12] me in the work then we'll to see who's
[57:15] right go back and ask him who created
[57:18] who when your preacher says her pastor
[57:22] what are we doing in the International
[57:23] and he comes up and he says well you
[57:26] know well there's three guards so so who
[57:27] created him
[57:29] did the father create the Sun in the Sun
[57:31] create the Holy Ghost or which one
[57:34] created who well they were told now here
[57:37] is our great Trinitarian concept they
[57:39] were all co-equal and coeternal that's
[57:44] in your creed to come on
[57:46] I can read too but work can you have
[57:53] them being : Co eternal then you call a
[57:57] Sun when the Sun has a beginning you
[58:04] can't call him eternal we don't believe
[58:06] in eternal sonship
[58:08] I believe in eternal God run yeah
[58:12] but not eternal sonship I can't be
[58:16] co-equal Co eternal that's not even good
[58:18] English
[58:19] not even a let alone good sense but get
[58:23] what I'm saying who was that back there
[58:28] then what happened in the garden before
[58:32] the guard never come into being what
[58:34] happened that's what we've been thinking
[58:36] about that Almighty God had a plan and a
[58:39] purpose he was going to create mankind
[58:41] create a world create all the things and
[58:44] bring it into manifestation and he knew
[58:49] all of that before the world ever begun
[58:52] and all he had to do was just stand
[58:54] there and saying let there be we'll pick
[58:57] up the Lord willing next Sunday when we
[58:59] get into Adam and where he would say
[59:01] brain Adam into existence as a human
[59:04] being upon flesh and start from there
[59:06] and begin our journey through time I
[59:10] hoping to leave that maybe we eventually
[59:12] get down to the stature of a perfect man
[59:14] to try to go back through that again one
[59:17] time
[59:17] and say a lot of things over again now I
[59:25] don't mean to be smart aleck I just mean
[59:28] to try to tell the truth I enjoyed what
[59:32] wage said there Wednesday night there's
[59:36] only how many letters in the 26 letters
[59:40] there's only 26 letters in the English
[59:43] language and there's no way hardly to
[59:46] say any two words without using one of
[59:49] them over again right then there's no
[59:55] way for me to preach another sermon
[59:57] without repeating myself you tell me how
[1:00:05] to do it you illustrate how can I bring
[1:00:08] another sermon without repeating myself
[1:00:10] then you'll see why Paul would say it's
[1:00:13] not a problem for me to repeat it he
[1:00:15] said it's needful for you
[1:00:19] let's see Church listen I wrote down
[1:00:22] just a simple little point the Roman
[1:00:26] says that he was declared to be the Son
[1:00:29] of God with power as I said even if
[1:00:34] you'll read the rest have said even the
[1:00:35] resurrection all of it comes in him who
[1:00:37] him Christ the Christ the Son of the
[1:00:42] Living God
[1:00:43] and that's why Ephesians would say all
[1:00:45] things were created by Jesus Christ not
[1:00:51] to just talk about the Christ cuz that's
[1:00:54] the anointed but Jesus was the very name
[1:00:57] of Almighty God you tell me any other
[1:00:58] name that he's got he said I come in my
[1:01:03] father's name to his father must have
[1:01:07] been Jesus because his name was Jesus
[1:01:09] oh that's just carnal stuff you just try
[1:01:11] well let you explain it just trying to
[1:01:17] get to a point what is a son of God as I
[1:01:22] say in a moment ago a son of God is an
[1:01:24] offspring right
[1:01:28] that would declare would have to have a
[1:01:30] father and a mother right and to be an
[1:01:36] offspring father can't do it by itself
[1:01:39] Mikey can't do it by herself we're not
[1:01:42] artificial but there's just remember
[1:01:43] you're getting it someone else or don't
[1:01:44] worry about it you're still in the same
[1:01:45] case don't argue with me on artificial
[1:01:48] insemination will reminds you you had to
[1:01:52] get them germs and eggs somewhere so
[1:01:56] then forget it all right
[1:01:57] but listen see if we don't believe in
[1:02:03] three gods we believe in one true and
[1:02:07] living God who dwelt upon the earth then
[1:02:13] Jesus was that Almighty God no he was
[1:02:19] son of God the flesh had a beginning the
[1:02:26] flesh is declared as the Son of God it
[1:02:29] had a beginning that makes him our
[1:02:30] brother that's why the Bible will say
[1:02:33] he's not ashamed to call us brethren
[1:02:34] because that's what it part but inside
[1:02:38] of that man that walked the shores of
[1:02:40] Galilee was a very soul of Almighty God
[1:02:44] the very spirit of Almighty God dwelled
[1:02:49] in a human vessel that we call Jesus see
[1:02:55] then he was what to be called he can be
[1:02:57] called a son of God when you know what
[1:03:02] you're talking about go see what I'm
[1:03:04] talking about a son of God I'm not
[1:03:06] talking about a second person they in
[1:03:08] the human terminology as we get to
[1:03:10] people James Colley and his daddy there
[1:03:12] would be two people but really by DNA
[1:03:14] it's not right DNA so saying oh you mean
[1:03:22] all the way back to the garden yeah all
[1:03:25] the way back to the garden your DNA
[1:03:27] proves who you are see we think of a son
[1:03:34] because we've been taught that her son
[1:03:35] had to have a beginning
[1:03:41] but why not be like you probably would
[1:03:43] bring it god condescended down into
[1:03:48] another form the word to be called a son
[1:03:54] to create and could be called a son of
[1:04:01] God do you see then walk into Church see
[1:04:10] what she's built on if she's built on
[1:04:12] the revelation of the son of God the
[1:04:16] Bible said Jesus Christ being the chief
[1:04:18] Cornerstone then you're built on a
[1:04:22] revelation of who he is and who is Jesus
[1:04:25] he was Almighty God made flesh or else
[1:04:28] your Trinity is like a body ours even if
[1:04:31] you want to say oh no no he wouldn't
[1:04:33] even tell me that he was the second
[1:04:34] person well where is it that a person's
[1:04:39] personality personality's an individual
[1:04:42] he's not no second person that around
[1:04:48] said he's not even the first person
[1:04:50] that's the best way to say it he said he
[1:04:53] is the person yeah but that makes you
[1:04:56] one this no because he as he
[1:05:01] condescended as I was trying to explain
[1:05:04] the other day don't do away with that
[1:05:08] father image and move it all into the
[1:05:11] Sun that is not the way your prophet is
[1:05:14] saying it your prophet said he's playing
[1:05:17] like a child before the father's door
[1:05:26] it's God moving over into another form
[1:05:30] it's God simply changing his form that
[1:05:37] he can manifest himself in another form
[1:05:40] but not another person I'm a father I'm
[1:05:44] a son of a pert I'm a human I'm a
[1:05:49] granddaddy I'm a great granddaddy
[1:05:53] right but how many people are they I'm
[1:05:59] just one all of those manifestations is
[1:06:04] part of my life but it doesn't change me
[1:06:08] to make me a different person
[1:06:12] it makes me what I am a son see fit we
[1:06:21] thought of that we would not have went
[1:06:23] into the the eternal Sun ships and all
[1:06:25] like that if we'd simply thought if
[1:06:27] mankind had a thought that it's not
[1:06:30] going into another person or another
[1:06:32] idea of course that goes all the way
[1:06:35] back to now see at 325 AD that's a long
[1:06:38] ways they've had to study this thing out
[1:06:40] and try to convince you it's right no
[1:06:46] but you see that's what we've been
[1:06:48] taught we only know what we talked my
[1:06:53] wife told me one time said don't the
[1:06:55] Bible say that you can't tell the
[1:07:00] seasons except of shedding to the trees
[1:07:03] and the budding of the leaves I said no
[1:07:06] honey you don't say that well she'd been
[1:07:11] told it said that you ever heard that
[1:07:14] show it to them in the Bible ever tub
[1:07:20] you ever heard this old one ever tubs
[1:07:23] gonna set on its own bottom show me that
[1:07:25] in the Bible that's what somebody told
[1:07:29] you they've got a really nicely one in
[1:07:33] there that's hard to do but in this
[1:07:35] plain language people say the Bible says
[1:07:39] it's better to put your seat in the
[1:07:41] belly of a horse than it is to put it on
[1:07:43] the ground now show me the Bible that
[1:07:49] would justify prostitution there ain't
[1:07:52] no Scripture for it it's what you've
[1:07:56] been taught all of your life you've been
[1:07:59] taught things mama taught me grandma
[1:08:03] talk where is it in the Bible
[1:08:06] well mama told me it was dark you find
[1:08:12] it for me
[1:08:15] you don't make a thousand bucks find me
[1:08:20] where it says Everett over said on
[1:08:21] what's on the bottom in the Bible and
[1:08:23] I'll be glad to mail around the world or
[1:08:25] anywhere a thousand bucks from you today
[1:08:26] cause you ain't gonna find it but you
[1:08:31] see it's what we've been taught out of
[1:08:32] their life until the concept is in our
[1:08:35] mind that has to be three gods cuz
[1:08:38] there's a guard over here in the guard
[1:08:39] over darkness guard over here you don't
[1:08:44] even realize the Bible terminology comes
[1:08:47] up to finally end of it that's a sonship
[1:08:49] will terminate the God may be all in all
[1:08:56] we get to glory we're not gonna see a
[1:08:58] halo over here in the pillar fire with
[1:09:00] higher than Jesus over here we're gonna
[1:09:02] see Jesus because he stood on this earth
[1:09:04] and said if you've seen me you've seen
[1:09:07] the father so when we get there who
[1:09:10] we're gonna see we're gonna see Jesus
[1:09:17] and who was he
[1:09:19] he was the word that created all times
[1:09:22] see the Holy Ghost and the Father and
[1:09:24] alls not a different person cuz remember
[1:09:26] you can get into a lot on that right who
[1:09:29] was the father of Jesus was the Holy
[1:09:33] Ghost his father or was the father his
[1:09:36] father all the father was involved with
[1:09:39] the Bible said he conceived Mary
[1:09:40] conceived of the Holy Ghost now you got
[1:09:43] Jesus with two daddies see you've been
[1:09:46] told and it's still dark its dwelling
[1:09:54] within you're not the worst the truth
[1:09:59] see all that we've ever tried to bring
[1:10:03] or everything I've ever tried to bring
[1:10:04] to where I could see the prophets
[1:10:06] message to bring it to understanding is
[1:10:08] that that word of God is the Creator God
[1:10:12] and there is the son of God I asked the
[1:10:17] question years ago to you and you don't
[1:10:19] like it because it exposed the people
[1:10:22] the woman here did exposed either so
[1:10:25] that's all right when I asked I said
[1:10:27] when I say son of God what do you think
[1:10:29] about I said you're thinking about 2,000
[1:10:33] years ago walking on the shores of
[1:10:34] Galilee but I said the son of God was
[1:10:36] the first form of God that went out in
[1:10:39] the beginning the low cost of speech I'm
[1:10:42] quoting your prophet the Son of God was
[1:10:48] to create horror why because when he
[1:10:51] came on earth he was still creating you
[1:10:56] know the reason I know Jesus was the
[1:10:57] Creator God because when he was on earth
[1:11:00] he was still creating right he took
[1:11:05] bread created he turned water into wine
[1:11:12] still created he created me in you by
[1:11:16] sowing the seed of the word to bring us
[1:11:20] into being as the children of Almighty
[1:11:21] God
[1:11:22] Kars offspring right you realize he had
[1:11:27] to create us mama daddy got us here
[1:11:32] that's this part out here inside of
[1:11:36] there is a being that God had to create
[1:11:40] and bring it into being the word the
[1:11:47] word is the son of God because that's
[1:11:51] the Creator God that's why Jesus said
[1:11:55] who two men stay out of son of man I
[1:11:57] said we don't understand what you're
[1:11:58] talking about son of man that's
[1:11:59] perforation right but it's a plain
[1:12:01] language we don't understand what you're
[1:12:03] talking about
[1:12:03] Peter he just looked and he said but
[1:12:05] they are in the Christ the Son of the
[1:12:06] Living God and Jesus just stopped and he
[1:12:08] said they ain't no need of me talking no
[1:12:09] more to you guys about son of man right
[1:12:11] he said cause you can't understand so
[1:12:15] I'm going to talk to you about the Son
[1:12:17] of God and demonstrated show you he went
[1:12:20] out through all of the things even the
[1:12:22] adoptions of things and he went to Mount
[1:12:25] of Transfiguration this is my beloved
[1:12:28] son hear him
[1:12:36] who do we serve what are we trying to
[1:12:41] bring not another god but God making
[1:12:46] himself known by his creation as he
[1:12:52] begins to create he's bringing into his
[1:12:54] nature and ways into being he goes
[1:12:58] through the Old Testament he's bringing
[1:12:59] it down through of his ways in his
[1:13:01] nature then he comes into the New
[1:13:06] Testament he stands in human flesh
[1:13:07] himself Hebrews 10 5 said what a body
[1:13:13] thou hath prepared me we know the
[1:13:17] prophets preaching the gospel brought
[1:13:20] the body right the prophets were the
[1:13:28] word they brought the word John being
[1:13:32] the life of the introducer the prophets
[1:13:37] brought the body who brought the body
[1:13:40] the prophets who the father through the
[1:13:43] prophets not another person see that's
[1:13:50] why when you get into this message and
[1:13:52] get the people they begin to this fall
[1:13:53] apart why because he I can still talk
[1:13:56] about a father I can still pray to my
[1:13:59] father jesus prayed to his father he
[1:14:11] just condescended into another phone
[1:14:15] right then one day he condescended into
[1:14:19] human flesh now here we're gonna end
[1:14:22] with it on he condescended into humans
[1:14:24] legs right John 1:14 and the Word was
[1:14:29] made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:14:37] the Creator God stood here in human
[1:14:41] flesh and said let there be a bride come
[1:14:45] forth as you don't understand what I'm
[1:14:48] talking about son of man what said one
[1:14:50] day I'll return and that's where I've
[1:14:52] always asked to just for the believers
[1:14:54] of the message to think of something
[1:14:56] where was anybody even a great Apostle
[1:15:02] Paul didn't even mention son of man I
[1:15:05] think said he didn't understand some
[1:15:07] time I just said he didn't put it in the
[1:15:09] word so it wasn't necessary cuz he knew
[1:15:12] not to put it dark maybe some of those
[1:15:15] things with what he said was things that
[1:15:16] would he said I can't even say it he
[1:15:21] never said anything about son of man the
[1:15:23] greatest of all are the prophets of the
[1:15:25] New Testament without a little old
[1:15:29] prophet coming out of Kentucky walking
[1:15:31] down through there with a seventh grade
[1:15:32] education and he starts in about forty I
[1:15:35] know in 47 because that's where we can
[1:15:37] start with him it's about 48 or 49 is
[1:15:39] the first time he says son of man
[1:15:50] because he knew the mystery we see that
[1:15:55] for the believers this message can't
[1:15:56] follow it they want to make him the son
[1:15:59] of man you all have been with me in 1969
[1:16:03] when I declared and trying to preach
[1:16:05] some feeling for the prophets message
[1:16:06] that the bride of Jesus Christ would be
[1:16:09] the son of man the Word made flesh in
[1:16:12] the last days oh I'll get some good
[1:16:16] smiles here I got a lot of friends in
[1:16:20] and I kept trying to say brother Branham
[1:16:22] is not the son of man the Lord Jesus
[1:16:24] Christ is the son of man but when the
[1:16:27] Lord Jesus Christ is birthed into his
[1:16:29] bride then his bride will be the son of
[1:16:31] man the Word made flesh again upon me
[1:16:36] that's the mystery to take us to the
[1:16:39] change the change will come because the
[1:16:44] people recognize who they are what
[1:16:47] they're doing here is that what your
[1:16:50] prophets did when the bride realized who
[1:16:51] she is what she's here for
[1:16:53] he said Satan will be powerless before
[1:16:55] you I'm gonna say this and just leave it
[1:17:03] we had an incident happen this past
[1:17:05] Wednesday night didn't I told my wife on
[1:17:11] the way home just as a witness of it
[1:17:15] they're taking her home to drop her and
[1:17:17] then going to the hospital I sit right
[1:17:20] there on that seat and this was Lord
[1:17:26] what's wrong what's the matter what's
[1:17:32] the problem I watch the service in the
[1:17:35] tune of the service the tune of the
[1:17:39] service was downbeat from the very
[1:17:41] beginning you say you're throwing off on
[1:17:43] me I'm telling the truth if you don't
[1:17:45] believe it it's forget it the tone of
[1:17:48] the service would down be from the
[1:17:50] playing of the music before the service
[1:17:52] to the singing of the songs it was so
[1:17:56] strong against me until I almost and
[1:18:00] I'll say this happens Boyd had always
[1:18:04] let me take the service and introduce
[1:18:06] the minister no he didn't do it
[1:18:09] Wednesday night till you see if he'd let
[1:18:11] me had that we would have sung because I
[1:18:15] knew there was something wrong something
[1:18:19] was so tight I sprayed God don't let
[1:18:23] this hinder wait
[1:18:26] free that up I'll get out and say
[1:18:31] something or do something it would have
[1:18:35] been better to me to got up and done
[1:18:36] what I've done wanna go and make you mad
[1:18:37] at me because it was something had to be
[1:18:40] done to break it Wade preach the message
[1:18:44] from the seal of the Redemption it broke
[1:18:46] it right down but it was still not right
[1:18:50] we went outside and June's mother fell
[1:18:53] over well I guess you noticed I didn't
[1:18:57] run the mom said brother they're down on
[1:19:01] his knees all that time I stayed right
[1:19:05] to her side with my hand on her side and
[1:19:09] you I said Satan this is what it is I
[1:19:13] fought you all that's not how you take
[1:19:18] your hand off she just started reviving
[1:19:23] up I tell that for the glory of the Lord
[1:19:28] what do you believe it or not cold I
[1:19:32] knew sitting right there there's
[1:19:33] something taking place that ain't right
[1:19:35] see he was fixing to manifest himself in
[1:19:38] a great way
[1:19:41] they never declared that she stopped
[1:19:43] breathing but you know she stopped
[1:19:45] breathing they know that her heart was
[1:19:47] not right in time because he was feeling
[1:19:49] up here
[1:19:51] it's the understood Satan now I know boy
[1:19:55] you've been exposed I knew you were here
[1:20:00] doing wrong to start with because he was
[1:20:02] controlling everything you get offended
[1:20:07] at that I would advise you not to it
[1:20:12] might be that it was the Lord
[1:20:15] don't credit it as being anything else
[1:20:18] I'm just telling it like it is
[1:20:22] cuz you see I believe the bride of Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ not no one person I believe the
[1:20:29] bride of Jesus Christ in this life days
[1:20:34] will be the Word made flesh and that'll
[1:20:42] bring about the resurrection but it's
[1:20:48] got to come first
[1:20:50] we're not changed the dead Christ on the
[1:20:52] first Indochina you see when we learned
[1:20:57] that Satan King controllers
[1:21:01] yeah but brother Dale I'm afraid what
[1:21:03] are you afraid of then Jordan brought up
[1:21:10] my head from death you think I'm afraid
[1:21:16] yeah but people have died yeah rudran
[1:21:20] said I don't care if a thousand dies
[1:21:22] tonight I'm pretty far he's not be back
[1:21:24] tomorrow not pray it something of that
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:27] there's people died with brother Branham
[1:21:29] preaching things right it's trying to
[1:21:35] get you to see who you are cause may I
[1:21:37] state it on this way what's gonna happen
[1:21:40] a day comes when you have a split second
[1:21:45] that means life or death now what are
[1:21:51] you gonna do come on musician what are
[1:21:56] you gonna do you ain't got time to pray
[1:21:59] oh I'll pray you ain't got time to pray
[1:22:04] a split second Saul it is between life
[1:22:08] and death
[1:22:09] what are you gonna do can I quote the
[1:22:12] Prophet he said Joshua did not have time
[1:22:19] to
[1:22:22] he said because he knew that he was
[1:22:25] prayed through before the foundation of
[1:22:30] the world that's what your prophet said
[1:22:34] about Joshua she all he had to do is
[1:22:36] just say it it's gonna come a time
[1:22:39] you're gonna see what I'm talking about
[1:22:41] one day you're gonna face death in
[1:22:43] somebody yourself or somebody else and
[1:22:45] all you got is your word to speak all
[1:22:49] you got is to believe it and say it I
[1:22:53] walked up to cross the driveway years
[1:22:56] ago my wife had been having a lot of
[1:23:03] trouble not problems in her body
[1:23:08] a voice said you say what it'll be and
[1:23:14] that's what it'll be I said but Lord I
[1:23:23] just can't see that I'm there to be able
[1:23:29] to say that it reminded me you say and
[1:23:38] that's the way it'll be I said what I
[1:23:40] can't I walked into the house my wife
[1:23:46] was violently sick from what was
[1:23:49] bothering her
[1:23:50] what would have been the difference that
[1:23:52] I am saying at least even just tried it
[1:23:58] come on
[1:23:59] even just tried it
[1:24:05] instead and let it be what you see no
[1:24:09] more will I do that it may be me and may
[1:24:12] be trying but from now on it'll be
[1:24:14] straight down the line cuz I've done
[1:24:16] seen God do too much and he's doing it
[1:24:20] through his people you say but that
[1:24:23] could have been anybody praying thank
[1:24:24] God you said that that could have been
[1:24:27] anybody praying and a lot of people were
[1:24:28] praying but you know what it could have
[1:24:30] been what you don't like it could have
[1:24:32] been one of these little children oh but
[1:24:37] not with me I'm not fed it you've seen
[1:24:40] people strut I'd once said it it might
[1:24:46] be one things little children is the one
[1:24:49] that said it and God heard them and
[1:24:53] that's heard their prayer not senior T's
[1:24:59] or what you think you are it's how do
[1:25:03] you believe God now me ending it by
[1:25:07] saying this much what are you telling
[1:25:09] that brother Dale I'm talking about the
[1:25:11] bride of Jesus Christ is the son of God
[1:25:13] made manifest listen now it's got to be
[1:25:18] a finish to it he's the son of me and
[1:25:21] made manifest because that brings her
[1:25:23] back to the faith of fathers but the son
[1:25:27] of man must come on the scene to change
[1:25:33] the bodies because that's what he come
[1:25:36] far we've had Redemption all the way
[1:25:40] down through the ages right we've had
[1:25:43] salvation we've had the thing we've had
[1:25:45] the great anointings right but there
[1:25:49] ain't no change
[1:25:55] you think we're gonna change weather
[1:25:57] there why can't I think they what are
[1:26:00] you gonna do you know one thing of the
[1:26:03] other now brother Howard Carroll said
[1:26:05] this one time
[1:26:06] that's quoting him and he said I'm
[1:26:11] either going to the grave or I'm going
[1:26:13] up pretty quick one way or the other
[1:26:14] because he knew thought age he's
[1:26:17] 80-something years oh he said I'm going
[1:26:20] one way or the other well why not
[1:26:23] believe that we just gonna take control
[1:26:25] of which way we go and why can't we just
[1:26:31] say let her be me I'll quote your
[1:26:36] prophet he said if it would for the fact
[1:26:39] that God had holding you by power he
[1:26:42] said you have within you the power to
[1:26:45] create a world to go live on I said it's
[1:26:47] holding a god himself he didn't say we
[1:26:52] didn't have the power ever child of God
[1:26:55] has not power but is given authority to
[1:27:01] use God's Word we don't worry about
[1:27:05] power power without character satanic
[1:27:09] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:27:12] what about it listening or we got really
[1:27:22] anybody have a need see God is with his
[1:27:25] church
[1:27:29] the son of the Living God is with us
[1:27:32] revealing himself
