[10:51] and also Romans the eighth chapter
[10:54] and I'm gonna begin reading that Saint
[10:56] John
[11:00] the 20th chapter excuse me and I'm going
[11:04] to begin reading at the 19th verse
[11:11] and it reads like this
[11:14] and the same day at evening being the
[11:18] first day of the week
[11:19] when the door was shut where the
[11:21] disciple was similar for the fear of the
[11:25] Jews came Jesus stood in their midst and
[11:28] said unto them peace be unto you
[11:31] when he had so said he showed unto them
[11:35] his hands and
[11:37] his side
[11:39] then the disciples didn't
[11:42] they were the disciple glad when they
[11:45] saw the Lord
[11:46] didn't say Jesus to them again peace be
[11:50] unto you as my father has sent me even
[11:54] so sin are you
[11:57] and when he had said just he's breathed
[12:00] on them
[12:01] and said
[12:03] unto them received
[12:06] he ate the Holy Ghost
[12:08] who's ever seen he remit they are
[12:12] remitted unto them and unto them and
[12:16] who's ever seen they should be retain
[12:18] they should be retained uh Romans 8.
[12:23] one verse from now
[12:25] Romans 8 verse 11.
[12:28] it says but if the spirit of him
[12:32] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[12:35] dwelling you
[12:37] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[12:40] she also quickened your mortal Body by
[12:44] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[12:47] a gracious father helpeth o God to
[12:50] to heal our bodies and our mind and our
[12:53] spirit oh God
[12:55] oh God help us to get ourselves out of
[12:57] the way this evening father
[12:59] but I give you all my spirit Lord in the
[13:01] name of Jesus Christ we pray
[13:03] amen God bless you you may be seated one
[13:06] moment
[13:08] thank the Lord for the reading of the
[13:10] word of God this evening
[13:13] until from the scripture this evening as
[13:15] we was opening the opening world when
[13:17] after Jesus resurrection he prayed to
[13:20] the uh come in the midst of them and we
[13:22] know the stories that peace be unto you
[13:24] Hallelujah we begin to look at her uh
[13:27] and then he began to show unto them his
[13:29] hands and his and he showed unto them
[13:31] his side in other words and then and
[13:33] then you know the story he made himself
[13:36] known to any vanished right on this site
[13:37] but we begin to look at this here again
[13:40] then we find out in Romans 8 it began to
[13:43] teach us just right here if the Same
[13:45] Spirit of him that raised up Christ from
[13:47] the dead if it dwell in you it will
[13:50] bring your body to the same Revelation
[13:52] that Christ walked in
[13:54] I had a title this evening and I want to
[13:58] use a title called energize
[14:01] for Rapture and faith
[14:03] energized for rapturing Faith and the
[14:06] reason I use energy because I begin to
[14:08] realize the whole world is based on
[14:10] energy
[14:11] the night we move our energy Hallelujah
[14:15] Electra we are right here where we
[14:17] sitting we are responding through the
[14:19] might we are responding By the Light
[14:21] tonight about uh uh uh about uh the
[14:25] internet that maybe set up here but the
[14:27] thing that's moving the church tonight
[14:29] uh the thing that moving there in this
[14:31] natural is energy right if the if the
[14:35] lights go out and the air condition go
[14:37] off everybody
[14:39] man they ain't sitting in this hot
[14:40] Church how did that just the way people
[14:42] deal I never did that it wasn't
[14:44] especially in America but yeah
[14:47] but you know what I'm saying everything
[14:48] is energy if you got a car what good is
[14:51] a car if it ain't got energy
[14:53] right Hallelujah you got a carnival
[14:56] crate hallelujah it's either one day it
[14:58] ain't got no gas or you brought it
[15:00] Forward right
[15:02] I believe
[15:04] hello let me leave that alone
[15:11] that just sounds so good I understand it
[15:15] but by God grace but the energy that we
[15:18] the energy that we talk about tonight we
[15:21] we we begin not beginning uh how did I
[15:24] come up with a domestic energy
[15:27] it was it was you know you said you
[15:29] you're trying to study and you're trying
[15:31] to get inspiration to come up with
[15:33] something to preach sometimes and
[15:35] brother Brandon was out there one time
[15:37] he was out there and uh uh out there and
[15:39] he said he walked across a cigarette
[15:40] pack
[15:51] we realized he got this inspiration by
[15:55] something he picked up and looked at and
[15:57] God inspired him so I'm thinking in my
[16:00] office I'm trying to think of Lord I'm
[16:02] trying to get inspirational living new
[16:04] quotes reading you know how you doing
[16:06] you anyway and all of a sudden I looked
[16:08] on my desk I had a pack of energized
[16:11] batteries
[16:12] and I said and I never leave you know I
[16:14] never I really ain't never paid no did
[16:16] you and I just looked on the back of the
[16:18] energized battery and I thought I'd just
[16:20] read what it says and then the energized
[16:23] battery it says the battery was designed
[16:25] to create a dynamic seal a line battery
[16:29] to hold a library to hold power for up
[16:33] to 10 years and I thought about that I
[16:36] said a battery is designed with a
[16:38] dynamic seal a line battery to hold his
[16:41] power up to 10 euros and when I thought
[16:44] about a seal I think thank God for a
[16:47] dynamic seal in line the bride to have
[16:50] enough power enough energy to go all the
[16:53] way to the Dead Redemption Hallelujah I
[16:56] thank God for that kind of power hell
[16:58] did everything and I realized it was the
[17:01] same energy the same dynamics that
[17:05] they're probably used in the teaching
[17:07] rising to the sun you know on the
[17:10] battery and then he used it in the the
[17:12] same it was spelled the same way and
[17:14] using the the message right into the Sun
[17:16] and he and he uses Corporation right
[17:19] here we put too much scratch on them
[17:21] tenants right
[17:23] and nothing on the Dynamics in other
[17:27] words we got this is the edge of
[17:29] mechanics everybody has got their minds
[17:32] on mechanics right but remember mechanic
[17:35] is no good we have to put out the power
[17:37] to put it in action I don't care what
[17:40] you got right right if it won't if
[17:43] there's no power to make it work it's no
[17:45] good that's right because it's so easy
[17:46] he said it it needs the dynamic power of
[17:50] God the resurrection problem Jesus
[17:52] Christ up on their church and manifest
[17:54] and to bring it to pass that it is
[17:56] gasoline it might be in a gasoline can
[18:00] can
[18:02] it can still be water see but the only
[18:05] the only proof of it is it put the life
[18:08] on it and prove what it is gas or not
[18:12] how you brew I guess you you play with a
[18:14] match right
[18:16] you get a match around gas it'll tell
[18:18] you if it's gas and you won't have to
[18:21] have you won't need nobody to come down
[18:22] to try to mechanically prove to you it
[18:25] was gas how do you won't need nobody to
[18:28] try to look it up on the computer and
[18:30] prove to you as gas just like a match
[18:32] already it'll prove Itself by the power
[18:35] that's already in it foreign
[18:38] and another one he says here
[18:41] and they talk about mechanics and
[18:43] Dynamics and the way he's in the
[18:45] mechanic without the dynamic is no good
[18:48] neither the dynamic without the mechanic
[18:51] you can scream and shout and jump
[18:56] up and down all you want to and deny the
[19:00] word it won't do you any good at all and
[19:03] then what we do today we don't find a
[19:06] testmatic move around the message how
[19:08] they're all to becoming a bunch of Holly
[19:11] shouting but no doubt don't understand
[19:13] the dynamic power that God done brought
[19:16] for this hand it won't do you no good
[19:18] how do you show that begin to relax yeah
[19:20] so I'm gonna
[19:22] use this kind of uh maybe break it down
[19:25] in my own way of doing it this evening
[19:28] so I begin to look here and I began to
[19:30] realize here that I'm beginning to
[19:32] realize him so we need energy we need
[19:34] energy drink we always trying to find
[19:36] something for energy right
[19:38] especially when you get old
[19:40] ER
[19:43] they come up with something when you get
[19:46] old but you said I'm gonna try that
[19:48] because everybody want to feel that
[19:49] little extra boost how do you you always
[19:52] want to feel like you did when you was
[19:53] 18 years old you might not look like you
[19:55] do your 18 year but at least you can
[19:57] feel like it so so you know we all want
[19:59] to try to get that little boost of
[20:01] energy how do you do when so the world
[20:03] if you notice all of a sudden it been an
[20:06] explosion of energy
[20:08] every day you go energy drink energy cry
[20:11] or energy cooking or energy chunga a
[20:15] bubble gum energy a candy everything all
[20:19] of a sudden why we go people body is
[20:22] breaking down and they need energy and
[20:24] we need energy in the natural
[20:26] we need God to come and bring energy
[20:29] into spiritual so we can make a right
[20:41] this energy that we need and this energy
[20:44] that we need Christ had to come down and
[20:46] express that energy
[20:48] anyway he was the very source of energy
[20:50] how do you know the word in that word he
[20:53] is he when Christ came he came to
[20:56] express I am the source of energy and if
[21:00] any man comes Ali after me pick up my
[21:03] cross I will energize it and listen we
[21:06] begin to look here so how did God bring
[21:08] his energy to the Earth how did God
[21:11] bring the source of energy it said by
[21:13] prophecy that God so loved the world
[21:16] that he gave his only begotten son and
[21:19] whosoever believe in him shall not bear
[21:21] he was energy
[21:24] so we're talking about God energy how do
[21:26] you know we begin to realize here he had
[21:28] to bring he had to express he wanted to
[21:31] express this energy so anyway I want you
[21:33] to understand something about God
[21:36] want you to understand something about
[21:38] God
[21:40] being in the image of God the spirit
[21:44] he never knew what it was
[21:47] to be weak right
[21:49] right God never knew what it was to be
[21:51] weak
[21:51] so because he was a spirit right how to
[21:54] show he could not go around when you're
[21:57] going through your Lord's bow Dolly and
[21:59] you're going to your lower trial how do
[22:01] God need to know what your how I feel to
[22:04] be a man right Hallelujah so the only
[22:06] way that God can feel what it is to be
[22:08] weak or the way that God you didn't feel
[22:10] that how it feel to be a man himself he
[22:13] had to become you that we might be
[22:15] through his energy may become him how to
[22:19] show what he did he made he moved from
[22:22] the invisible God
[22:24] into a good of up with skin on him right
[22:27] right and you according to the Bible
[22:29] here Mary received the word how did
[22:32] Christ come through prophecy of Isaiah
[22:34] of burnish accuracy he even materialize
[22:37] it himself around his own work at one
[22:41] day man I had to him one day he became
[22:44] in a human body and when he doubled his
[22:47] human body he know what you're going
[22:49] through when you get tired he know what
[22:52] it was to be tired I mean when you have
[22:54] a headache he know what it is he was not
[22:57] sin but he became sin through his own he
[23:00] man in the word God had no sin in him
[23:03] Christ was not even born in sin right
[23:06] the only way he could become sin he took
[23:08] us all off same curse it is a man hang
[23:11] on the tree he put his own self
[23:13] underneath
[23:14] right and he took the sins of the world
[23:16] upon himself
[23:18] telling this energy he had this energy
[23:21] that he was going to express he wanted
[23:24] to show him he wanted to understand his
[23:27] power he wanted to understand so as a
[23:30] man as a man as a man God as a man and
[23:34] when he come in the form of Christ he
[23:37] knew what it was to be weak right
[23:40] yet still he know what it was to be weak
[23:45] as a man but he also know what it is to
[23:48] be powerful in the spirit so what would
[23:51] he do he was trying to show up the
[23:53] weakness of the flag Hallelujah not to
[23:55] depend on it but be pinned on the power
[23:58] of the word Heaven because we had to see
[24:00] how weak the flush him so we can have
[24:02] confidence in the word
[24:05] amen said everybody says here we begin
[24:08] to realize here when Jesus came he
[24:10] immediately God has him then he goes
[24:12] into he goes out here let me say
[24:15] reversion how did he was born marry his
[24:17] boy he came into the world I want you to
[24:20] notice something about him coming yeah
[24:25] according to that word she became pretty
[24:28] heard nothing about Jesus
[24:31] did 12 years old he shows up in the
[24:34] temple yeah
[24:35] teaching him and teaching them about the
[24:38] scripture
[24:40] in other words so here all of a sudden
[24:43] Mary and Joseph came and they said uh
[24:46] we're your father and I sought you where
[24:48] you are hey Jesus said no and don't you
[24:50] be done with Joseph not my father right
[24:52] and you're not my mama woman right honey
[24:55] I'm about my father business so Jesus
[24:58] you know what he he had the wisdom he
[25:01] took his wisdom and showed who he was so
[25:04] we hear no more about him right
[25:07] then all of a sudden one day John was
[25:10] baptizing
[25:13] on the River Jordan and Jesus come
[25:16] walking out
[25:17] and when John looked at him he said
[25:20] behold Hallelujah Behold the Lamb of God
[25:24] I'll talk about the one that was not
[25:26] born like me and you was born honey the
[25:29] one that when he came he came from God
[25:31] and he was going back for the God Amen
[25:34] so what he even did he walked out in the
[25:36] water what did God do
[25:38] he was God
[25:40] but he needed to be activated right
[25:42] Hallelujah you know either way the
[25:45] prophecy needed to be activated
[25:49] he didn't come to walk out in the water
[25:51] he come to heal the sick he come to open
[25:54] the blind it up anybody had to be
[25:57] activated what did he do what he wanted
[25:59] that in the water the spirit of God the
[26:01] spirit of the god like a dog company
[26:03] sitting at Heaven he's not come down to
[26:06] energize you to put you in action
[26:09] Hallelujah put him in action
[26:20] he goes into the Wilderness right let me
[26:23] tempted of the devil
[26:25] he was weak he first in 40 days
[26:28] 40 nights
[26:29] and he was weak
[26:32] he was so weak
[26:33] a 40-day fast
[26:35] and you he had no chicken you're gonna
[26:37] be weak
[26:38] I'm just rotating it right now I mean
[26:41] you're gonna be thinking about all kind
[26:42] of Temptations in your mind gonna
[26:44] probably start acting up and all of a
[26:46] sudden the devil moved into him and he
[26:48] got this week what was he trying to
[26:50] teach us he was trying to teach us to
[26:53] have faith in God the weakest Christian
[26:56] can beat the devil in the ground
[26:58] hallelujah oh you beat the devil not by
[27:01] a human ability but you beat the Devil
[27:03] by the word and faith in the word so
[27:06] what did he did he goes out there and
[27:08] the devil come preaching the Bible
[27:19] that's right he shouldn't say bread
[27:21] because in the beginning God gave him
[27:23] bread and it went out and fell he told
[27:25] Adam he's gonna eat the bread until you
[27:27] return to the desert here the devil came
[27:29] and picked the scripture back up miss
[27:31] little Kaden this interpreting the
[27:33] scripture saying if thou be the Son of
[27:35] God this is what God told you to eat but
[27:37] Jesus said man he did not deny the bread
[27:40] he's the if man should not live my bread
[27:43] alone
[27:45] always stays great with the word Heaven
[27:48] and the devil came and quoted Psalms 91
[27:50] challenged him to cast himself down how
[27:53] did Jesus say to the devil he said it is
[27:56] written don't you tempt the Lord thy God
[27:58] and then we showed him all the kingdoms
[28:00] of the world and the Gina Beat the Devil
[28:02] by saying I'll Worship the Lord that God
[28:04] and him only shall I serve because the
[28:07] word case sir nothing but but God right
[28:09] amen hallelujah we begin to look at him
[28:11] and Jesus so in other words admittedly
[28:15] when it goes through the Temptation
[28:17] right
[28:17] that Bible said the Angels had to come
[28:19] because he needed recharge honey now I
[28:23] want you to notice this recharge it he
[28:25] needed to be charged up again Hallelujah
[28:28] you remember how it was used to be in
[28:30] the whole day you got a toy
[28:32] and the battery run down yeah
[28:35] yeah and you put it on the oven
[28:37] right and then heat the elements up then
[28:39] you throw it back in the toilet the
[28:40] better run a little longer it ain't like
[28:42] the high-tech stuff they got today
[28:44] you know they man I see kids they're not
[28:47] gonna make you want to be a kid again I
[28:48] said look guys got helicopter wow
[28:52] everything I had I had to ring
[28:57] that day
[29:00] it's not bugging no more brother here
[29:05] hello this is over here I need to stand
[29:08] right there man they're like wow oh man
[29:12] so you know what's in here but you had
[29:14] to steal the battery would run down and
[29:16] when the battery would get weed how did
[29:18] the battle was getting weak and we'll
[29:19] try to charge it back up to get energy
[29:21] and if the battery had a good sale it
[29:24] will hold a charge but if a baby got a
[29:27] dead sale it won't hold a chore I know
[29:29] that's what it is today if you gotta say
[29:32] only you that come from God you will
[29:34] hold a charge
[29:36] foreign
[29:38] you know something I brought a watch
[29:41] it wouldn't run
[29:43] I said what's wrong with the stupid
[29:44] watch
[29:47] yeah you know I'm trying to figure out
[29:49] what your tempting anymore and I look
[29:52] there now I've seen a little plastic
[29:53] paper
[29:56] and I poured it out
[29:58] and it activated the watch
[30:00] how did God put a seal in you honey for
[30:04] your day in this message and you could
[30:07] not be activated in Lutheran you could
[30:09] not have been activated but in this end
[30:12] God sent a voice I have to pull the seal
[30:15] the loose what do you do it put you in
[30:17] action for your age Hallelujah tell what
[30:21] he been doing we all been activated by
[30:23] the word of God
[30:24] God is putting something in her he told
[30:27] Jesus said Saint John went down he's an
[30:29] immediate received him he gave me power
[30:32] to become the sons of God and it ain't
[30:34] your own power we move about it ain't my
[30:36] power but it's by the power here that
[30:39] running on his Shadows
[30:43] but Jesus himself
[30:45] he was energy
[30:47] he was a very source of energy
[30:50] right Hallelujah in other words
[30:51] so everywhere he went
[30:54] he always released energy
[30:56] he couldn't even go to a funeral service
[30:58] he could not even go to a funeral
[31:00] service without a resurrection take
[31:02] place he was so full of God energy
[31:05] anyway when something happened
[31:09] but you're saying being a man he he had
[31:13] the ability to get weak he had the
[31:15] ability to get tired he was on the he
[31:17] was on the boat one time because he was
[31:19] tired he went down to go to sleep
[31:22] he was having no doubt a good nicely
[31:25] good rest I'd be a good rest today by
[31:27] two hours before I feel good
[31:29] so he got he was tired and all of a
[31:33] sudden the bull got in the rain and the
[31:35] Storm come everybody forgot that the
[31:37] source of energy was on the boat and all
[31:40] of a sudden somebody come to their
[31:41] remembrance and people said go down
[31:43] there and wake the master how did Gina
[31:45] brother say nobody can get no sleep
[31:47] around here yeah
[31:53] energy that you need is already here not
[31:57] on the boat but in the soul of man ready
[32:00] all we need to do is wake it by faith
[32:02] heavy so he says here he gets up on the
[32:05] boat he moves out there he be tired but
[32:08] inside of him with the power of almighty
[32:11] God peace be still all he needed was to
[32:14] speak the word
[32:17] of myself but haven't said another point
[32:20] I want to bring out you remember her you
[32:22] remember when uh when all of a sudden
[32:25] here that this we talking about
[32:27] activating you know what I was on how
[32:29] did I meant to use this how do you
[32:30] remember when when when Elizabeth got
[32:32] impregnated and the angel came to
[32:35] Livermore and told Elizabeth that John
[32:37] will go in the spirit of Elijah
[32:40] he remember the promising he went to
[32:42] Elizabeth
[32:43] in Saint Luke 1 he told Elizabeth he
[32:46] told the angel told her that John would
[32:49] go forth in the spirit of Elijah
[32:51] Hallelujah but the point everyone how
[32:53] you living with was carrying a dad Berry
[32:55] yeah
[32:56] the baby had never been activated
[32:59] so prophecy was laying there was not
[33:02] manifested at that time but she needed
[33:05] somebody to activate the promise so God
[33:09] sent Mary now because the Lord got a gun
[33:12] remember the the the voice had to come
[33:16] to the bride I leave Mary be the type of
[33:18] the Bride she goes down there because
[33:20] living but needed a Revival
[33:23] he she had had a Revival
[33:26] when a woman got her dead baby she's
[33:28] under depression
[33:29] that's right because a sign that a baby
[33:31] is lying you feeling some movement
[33:35] if it's not moving it gonna cause some
[33:37] problems so Elizabeth no doubt was
[33:39] fighting especially being in her old age
[33:41] but fighting depression already you know
[33:44] I'm having this baby now it ain't no
[33:46] movement in my body something is wrong
[33:48] how did the angel told me about heaven
[33:50] but the baby had not moved it what was
[33:53] the baby doing the baby was waiting on
[33:55] the spirit of Prophecy tells you to
[33:58] stand up how did Mary goes down there
[34:00] and when she saluted ligma John was
[34:04] activated and received a power to Holy
[34:07] Ghost
[34:08] the activating power and come to divorce
[34:12] honey they come back here am I hear in
[34:15] the word of God if you're gonna be
[34:16] activated
[34:19] you're gonna have to hear God voice
[34:22] hello
[34:24] look at you
[34:26] show you Jesus could be drank
[34:28] you remember one time Jesus was in a
[34:30] meeting
[34:31] and all of a sudden he preaching to all
[34:34] the people's run
[34:35] that was just a little woman
[34:38] that had a blood issue
[34:40] right she if I could just only sneak in
[34:42] there
[34:43] he just touch
[34:45] that him up has gone
[34:47] I could be I don't need to touch his
[34:48] head
[34:49] I don't need to touch his hand
[34:51] if I can get just to the lower part of
[34:53] it was going to touch it I could be made
[34:56] whole
[34:57] and all of a sudden she moves through
[34:59] the crowd because she would not let
[35:01] nobody see a movie through the crowd
[35:03] because those I wouldn't say even
[35:05] them Disciples of that they would have
[35:07] turned this woman away because the woman
[35:09] with a blood issue was counting unclean
[35:11] Hallelujah so no religious legalism
[35:13] Spirit were not a little unclean woman
[35:16] touch Jesus but Jesus let us sneak do
[35:18] that right
[35:26] right honey you know when you put your
[35:27] cables on a car and you're going to try
[35:30] to crank a dead battery a battery you
[35:32] know it pulling the other bag
[35:33] what are you doing it's pulling energy
[35:36] from one to the day when she pulled my
[35:39] thing she was able to pour energy Jesus
[35:41] said
[35:42] he said I got weak he said who touched
[35:45] me and Peter them looked at him they
[35:47] said man come on master
[35:50] I always say something off the wall man
[35:53] all these people touching you come on
[35:55] man yeah what's wrong
[35:57] what you mean who touched you Jesus said
[35:59] this time yeah yeah it wouldn't have
[36:01] touched I can't hear the touch honey
[36:03] when I got in touch this time it pulled
[36:06] from my inside honey I feel energy left
[36:10] in my body I needed that person that
[36:12] touched me ain't poor enough energy into
[36:15] them I knew that that blood issue that
[36:17] demon had to leave their bodies
[36:19] how did Jesus turn around and looked at
[36:22] the crowd he didn't say woman that
[36:23] favored made the whole how the woman you
[36:25] are healed or whatever what are you sure
[36:27] to do he was sure to do I don't care
[36:29] what condition the person is I don't
[36:31] care what kind of blood this is if
[36:33] they have enough Faith to touch me
[36:35] they'll be me whole I don't care what
[36:38] the problem is think what move God
[36:43] energy
[36:44] all right so we begin to look at her
[36:47] he wanted to show us this energy
[36:51] he would assured that I am the
[36:53] resurrection I am the life so he wanted
[36:57] to learn the hell confident how did all
[36:59] the source of energy come through him
[37:01] how do you oh all our energy all our
[37:04] spirit come from almighty God how did
[37:06] what did Palace said Palace said I have
[37:08] power to do this
[37:09] Jesus said nobody not this time right
[37:12] not at this time
[37:14] you only have the energy or the power to
[37:17] do this because it comes from God
[37:20] hallelujah your life is depending on me
[37:23] Hallelujah and the energy that you got
[37:25] to come against me is to fulfill my
[37:27] scripture so I'm energizing you to go
[37:30] the opposite way right
[37:32] so that basically what it was but one
[37:35] time we find out here again
[37:38] Jesus energy
[37:40] was not given to him for himself
[37:44] right the energy that he had he had a
[37:46] purpose how do you show and then where
[37:48] his purpose was how I'm gonna come and
[37:51] I'm going to show through me believing
[37:53] in me the source of energy how do you I
[37:56] don't care where you ate I don't care
[37:58] how weak you are if you need it I'll be
[38:01] there all on time Hallelujah but I
[38:03] remember one time Jesus went up on on a
[38:05] map called Mount Transfiguration
[38:08] that energy was just over you know you
[38:11] can get too much energy and overload a
[38:14] box right sometimes I do that you just
[38:16] put too much on a box and then what it I
[38:19] call it a surge of power or whatever it
[38:21] is and then knock out the lights too
[38:22] much energy I need too much energy
[38:24] overloaded you put a 220 on a on a 110
[38:27] you're gonna hold the load something how
[38:29] do you know what I'm saying Show Jesus
[38:31] himself one time his body begin to punch
[38:34] away for two minutes Jesus I got to go
[38:36] release this energy
[38:38] I'm having a problem search honey
[38:41] somebody dude goes on my Transfiguration
[38:43] and he releases the energy how do we
[38:47] need to release the energy the power
[38:49] that knew what happened a resurrection
[38:51] took place
[38:56] and all of a sudden Elijah walked out of
[38:59] the Grave was Christ released his energy
[39:01] ain't going to bring forth raps in pain
[39:04] the bride is here that we are the one
[39:07] they're going to see God release his
[39:09] energy when the dead in Christ come and
[39:11] meet us on Earth
[39:13] somebody on them please see that promise
[39:16] Hallelujah
[39:18] find him
[39:21] cheated one time he had a friend that
[39:22] died
[39:24] the battery went dead
[39:27] he was in the grave
[39:30] he had been there for four days
[39:33] now that battery's
[39:35] her battery's dead
[39:37] and got a dead sale
[39:39] you can jump it off all you want to
[39:41] that's why Judas couldn't hold a charge
[39:46] Judah is getting a hold of George
[39:49] his energy run lower level run low
[39:52] before he got to Pentecost Hallelujah in
[39:54] the world he might be like that you
[39:56] little energetic Little Robot how did he
[39:58] was walking but before he made it to
[40:00] Pentecost it stopped right
[40:14] he had a friend
[40:16] named Lazarus
[40:18] so Elijah's been in the grave for four
[40:20] days
[40:21] he's already stanking circumstance
[40:25] in other words Martha hears about this
[40:29] is Jesus's message they come because
[40:32] your best friend is sick
[40:34] and Jesus went on doing his right
[40:36] Ministry whatever he was doing at that
[40:39] moment
[40:40] knowing that Liza was in this condition
[40:44] so about four days after he died
[40:47] Jesus excuse me he decided I'm gonna go
[40:49] down there now
[40:51] because now they can't say that their
[40:53] tradition is saying that lives of the
[40:56] spirit hangs at the Jewish leader that
[40:58] the spirit lingers around the body for
[41:00] three days and Gina would have rolled
[41:02] him in three days they would have went
[41:03] to their tradition but he waited to the
[41:05] fourth stage he broke that tradition and
[41:07] he showed up how did so everything
[41:09] worked together how did he shows he's
[41:11] going down there and Martha approaches
[41:13] him oh Master if you would have been
[41:16] here my brother would not have died if
[41:19] she would have had the right faith and
[41:21] she wouldn't believe who he really was
[41:23] see you could have spoke the word that's
[41:25] right amen what did the satira say I
[41:28] don't need you to come to my house I
[41:30] don't need to see your body I need you
[41:32] to speak the word because he understands
[41:35] the authority behind the words
[41:41] and then Jesus said he'll rise you know
[41:45] the story she said yes Lord I know he
[41:46] will whatever you ask God and then the
[41:49] story goes she was not really looking at
[41:51] it in the light that Jesus was looking
[41:52] at it right because when they come to
[41:54] the final end she said oh yes Lord
[41:57] I know he will raise in the general
[42:00] adoration so now she's putting the
[42:02] resurrection way over here how do you
[42:04] know that in other words why was she
[42:06] looking because she had a reason why he
[42:08] couldn't write it now because he was
[42:10] already snagging but that if God have no
[42:14] limitation on faith Hallelujah anyway he
[42:17] said show me what you lay to me
[42:19] Hallelujah see that I know you're
[42:21] raising the resurrection
[42:23] Jesus said I am amen I am the source of
[42:27] energy amen I am a resurrection how do
[42:30] you show me where you laid it right amen
[42:34] David go down to the Grave
[42:36] you know when you jump a call
[42:40] you know how it is you just don't go to
[42:42] a car
[42:43] pull the hood up yeah hook the cables up
[42:45] to the car they got the strong battery
[42:47] and hold them in your hand and say jump
[42:49] off
[42:50] tell me how you drop a call you can
[42:53] shout hallelujah
[42:55] your whole cables do you blew in the
[42:57] face here never jumped
[42:59] somebody gotta hook it up
[43:03] himself not at least we ain't got that
[43:06] that phone technology yet but they're
[43:08] probably working on it but it Wheels but
[43:10] right now it's still manually done you
[43:12] put one cable here in one game but uh a
[43:14] negative and a positive how they didn't
[43:16] yeah then the one that's in the car he
[43:19] said that maybe he I know him to crank
[43:21] my eyes you never know and he crank it
[43:23] here and all the woods you can feel your
[43:25] body
[43:26] what are you doing pool and energy and
[43:29] that battery has not got a dead cell in
[43:31] it you crank that it'll take off and
[43:33] it'll keep it'll keep running it'll keep
[43:35] going but if it got a dead cell in it
[43:38] the sooner you cut it back on
[43:40] right you got to go back and do that
[43:41] again how did that one Joe we got too
[43:43] many dead sales in the church
[43:48] Hallelujah I don't think I'm gonna make
[43:50] it I miss man we'll start back to Dragon
[43:52] I think that's a dead cell
[43:55] you always have to jump them off
[43:57] everything to see if I need another jump
[43:59] off and if you need another jumbo you
[44:01] need to get a new battery you need to
[44:03] ask God to return you with a
[44:05] supernatural face how do that you could
[44:07] make it to the Rapture and then Paul say
[44:09] you did run well but what happened to
[44:11] you
[44:13] so Jesus get down to the internalizers
[44:16] have you noticed
[44:18] him being God all he had to do is walk
[44:20] up to the stone the storm that was over
[44:22] the
[44:24] Moonstone that's right right he didn't
[44:26] need them but you got to do something
[44:28] too right when I come to jump you off
[44:30] you got to get the cables and do it he
[44:32] said I want you to roll the stone away I
[44:35] want you to hook it up Holly I want you
[44:37] to put the negative deposit together
[44:39] honey I want that's your job he had to
[44:41] hook it up it's your job to come to
[44:43] church and hear Faith how do you I want
[44:45] to get Faith do you need to come here
[44:47] and hook up the cables in the world
[44:50] that's your job to come here to work
[44:52] Hallelujah and all of a sudden they
[44:55] hooked it up how did Jesus been the son
[44:57] how did God Chatham energy how did his
[45:00] body couldn't do it but the power that
[45:01] was on the inside of him good he cried
[45:04] with a lot of boys
[45:31] all right
[45:33] amen
[45:37] but you know in all this
[45:40] in Jesus ministry
[45:42] like I said his ministry was
[45:45] the energy that he had
[45:48] in that body yeah yeah he intended to
[45:50] release it
[45:52] why do you think he told me it's
[45:53] important I go away
[45:55] if I don't go away you won't have enough
[45:57] energy to make this life hell if I don't
[45:59] go away you won't have enough energy to
[46:01] fight the spiritual warfare you up
[46:02] against hardly because they're going to
[46:04] take us they're going to take a a
[46:06] special anointing up on you to be able
[46:08] to come to Spirit of age
[46:21] when Jesus was in that body that body
[46:24] had a limitation
[46:26] he had to release that limitation right
[46:28] right
[46:29] say what oh yes because if God didn't
[46:32] get tired
[46:34] God didn't get time hello Jesus Jesus
[46:37] moved around in that body and he comes
[46:39] in the disciple be there he'll say
[46:43] this mask open the door
[46:53] the devil said I'm gonna get rid of this
[46:55] energy
[46:56] I'm gonna fire I'm gonna get rid of him
[46:58] he didn't know what he was doing right
[47:01] right if he killed him
[47:03] and trying to take him and if he go to
[47:06] the grain
[47:07] It Ain't No Stopping now
[47:09] when the devil did this he didn't
[47:11] realize what he doing
[47:13] he not didn't own it did he try to get
[47:16] rid of the energy he just released the
[47:18] energy because once he come out of the
[47:21] green I didn't want you to come out of
[47:23] the Grave he never made the statement
[47:26] before in his Earthly Ministry when he
[47:28] walked around before he died once he
[47:31] conquered death baby to hell he slipped
[47:33] up to them say I got all power
[47:36] my energy is all power in heaven in
[47:39] Earth so what he said I'm claiming all
[47:42] energy
[47:43] and I want to tell you what
[47:47] because everybody was walking around
[47:48] here you go he says let me show you now
[47:51] his body is energized he's so much
[47:54] energy now he don't even knock the door
[47:57] honey walk right in the midst of his
[47:59] stuff how do they look he's a distance
[48:01] this is not a ghost
[48:03] put your hand right here how do you put
[48:05] your head put your head right here I do
[48:07] a Sprinkle me a piece of fish
[48:09] how did this body right here is

[57:10] Revelation he hate when the bride get
[57:13] Revelation right because he know he's
[57:15] defeated right

[57:25] he says here
[57:27] it's the body they're going to defeat
[57:28] the Devil right
[57:30] right the mind of Christ is going to be
[57:31] in you
[57:32] and the body
[57:34] the same attribute that was in in in a
[57:37] in the book of Acts with three when he
[57:40] went down now it says it is now man let
[57:43] look on us

[58:09] Hallelujah so now he says
[58:11] and this is what God been doing
[58:13] this message has no love they don't got
[58:16] it all messed up
[58:18] people don't got it all allocated
[58:20] because everybody said the message was
[58:21] William Brennan no brother Brandon never
[58:23] say to mentioned with you all right
[58:24] brother Brandon said the message was
[58:26] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[58:29] Avail so when the men that were looking
[58:31] at the veil got blinded from the
[58:33] supernatural so now all they can do is
[58:35] pull up but they made a mistake made a
[58:37] mistake but I'm not looking at no
[58:39] mistake because I'm seeing the word made
[58:40] flesh
[58:41] I'm seeing the same note on it that was
[58:44] on the prophet of God made flesh
[58:50] it's the way you see it right he said
[58:53] well he made a mistake blood was a god
[58:55] like me he's a god allowed me to say
[58:57] anything to throw some people off he
[58:59] noticed so many dead cells was running
[59:01] the message they wouldn't go on in the
[59:03] resurrection no way how did Jesus said
[59:05] they were full of dead man they couldn't
[59:07] get charged up but as many had received
[59:10] him he gave him power right
[59:13] the whole of George
[59:15] when I see a man give up this day I
[59:16] didn't realize that's a dead sale
[59:18] right and he couldn't go up to Pentagon
[59:20] one of them little toys
[59:22] energized
[59:27] that's all right and where'd he go
[59:30] LLY but God gave you something to go all
[59:32] the way
[59:33] he said pause it he told the bird you
[59:36] did run well
[59:38] why your batteries start the weekend now
[59:41] this is the last mile of the way right
[59:46] if I give up now right
[59:48] how to listen to all this garbage people
[59:51] love to hear people people love lies
[59:53] yeah
[59:54] all people love life you want to sell
[59:56] some you want to sell something tell a
[59:58] good lie
[1:00:00] all you got to do I saw Ella Presley
[1:00:02] riding a bike in Memphis wow
[1:00:05] I saw Michael Jackson the other day
[1:00:08] eating a restaurant
[1:00:10] you see him eating somewhere today it
[1:00:11] won't be in this room
[1:00:16] let me leave that alone but here is
[1:00:19] and he says here
[1:00:21] and to be sure that the whole rapture
[1:00:24] now Luther was a port
[1:00:27] this message have been building up the
[1:00:30] body
[1:00:31] this is why they couldn't have what you
[1:00:33] have but your hands and feet everybody
[1:00:36] got to work together
[1:00:38] now if I wanted to go to church tonight
[1:00:40] and my feelings didn't want to go we're
[1:00:41] gonna have problems
[1:00:45] you say I'm going to church your mind
[1:00:46] saying your feet say I'm tired
[1:00:49] you got some miscommunication
[1:00:51] if you look in the natural realm and
[1:00:53] they'll probably says something is wrong
[1:00:55] or you deformed or something if you tell
[1:00:57] your hand to feed you and then slap you
[1:00:59] every day
[1:01:02] except mentally he's not acting right
[1:01:04] right
[1:01:05] because the body is made the fitly joint
[1:01:08] and work together right isn't that why
[1:01:10] he preached them in Christ and Mr God
[1:01:11] revealed he said the fail can't look at
[1:01:13] that even though it's just a little
[1:01:15] teeny bit of your finger right right you
[1:01:17] can't do that little bit of your finger
[1:01:18] is more important to you you think it is
[1:01:20] you might look at this ain't nothing but
[1:01:23] a little man it don't mean nothing to me
[1:01:24] just my little bit of finger it ain't
[1:01:26] got no it don't got no I don't care
[1:01:28] about that part you think you don't care
[1:01:30] about it hit it with a hammer
[1:01:33] it'll make your body break dance
[1:01:36] oh yeah it's gonna make you do something
[1:01:38] you think you don't think I didn't tried
[1:01:40] it before
[1:01:41] oh but I got out of there wow
[1:01:44] oh wow
[1:01:46] I did things I didn't know I would do
[1:01:50] you better be careful you might say
[1:01:52] something you want to say
[1:01:54] and finger right there got a lot of
[1:01:56] blood pretentions in it Hallelujah net
[1:01:59] worth so he said nah be sure either be
[1:02:02] sure that the whole the whole Rapture
[1:02:04] now
[1:02:05] now let me go excuse me to be sure that
[1:02:08] the whole Rapture now Luther was a boy
[1:02:10] what's it was a boy
[1:02:13] the prophets was a boy but they are
[1:02:16] are not
[1:02:19] give myself a mine there are not a part
[1:02:22] just
[1:02:24] just a revelation that they was making
[1:02:30] oh goodness
[1:02:32] and one thing about getting old
[1:02:35] I love my glasses oh yeah okay you're
[1:02:38] making up to making up the body excuse
[1:02:41] me making up the body feet toes on and
[1:02:45] so forth until the head which we we get
[1:02:48] to that in a few minutes see that making
[1:02:51] up the entire Rapture it is the body of
[1:02:54] the word which is Christ amen outside
[1:02:57] the dead you were lost
[1:02:59] there's no Rapture outside the body
[1:03:02] right and the body at the last day this
[1:03:06] is the edge of the intelligence of God
[1:03:08] the mind of God is here the wife is the
[1:03:11] only one that knows what he won't done
[1:03:13] with his word exactly she know how to
[1:03:15] please a mate right Hallelujah that's
[1:03:17] why he's saying when he's at a bride
[1:03:19] know her mate the reveal word what she
[1:03:22] comes to the intelligence
[1:03:23] we come to the point that the body the
[1:03:27] brave is what tells the body to cast our
[1:03:29] Devils when a demon come on your body if
[1:03:32] the brightness in the signal to fight
[1:03:34] for you
[1:03:37] your body don't uh uh uh Alien maybe uh
[1:03:41] a German virus your brain sends a signal
[1:03:45] attack that demon so God is giving the
[1:03:48] mind to the Christ given the mind to the
[1:03:50] body so we know how to fight spiritual
[1:03:52] warfare
[1:03:53] foreign
[1:04:05] or how religious
[1:04:07] or no how what your relationship is
[1:04:10] or what your fellowship is or what your
[1:04:13] the nomination is organization is your
[1:04:16] loss outside of the word being in you if
[1:04:20] you're abide in me the word my word
[1:04:22] about in you didn't ask what you will
[1:04:24] because you end the word are the same
[1:04:28] and the word is God mine how did we
[1:04:31] gonna take the mind of God and this last
[1:04:34] day this bride is going to put the devil
[1:04:36] in this place he said why because the
[1:04:39] Bible tells you why you think all this
[1:04:40] judgment is falling how do everything
[1:04:42] waiting for something to take place
[1:04:44] either you wait until that third pool
[1:04:47] wake up
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:54] because he told me wait you want that
[1:04:56] third pool if God don't Supply his bride
[1:04:59] in this place in the last day if he
[1:05:01] don't take care of his bride like he did
[1:05:03] Elijah it's something wrong with the God
[1:05:05] we serve but he promised I would never
[1:05:07] leave you or forsake you and at the time
