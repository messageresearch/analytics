[11:12] foot washing after
[11:15] service one of the things
[11:17] that that we've always at this
[11:21] church believed in all the
[11:25] ordinances and we try our best to do
[11:28] them all
[11:32] I know I told you there was one Pastor
[11:33] one time we asked him about taking
[11:35] communion he said we take communion when
[11:38] when we uh the pastor felt the people
[11:40] were ready I said well we probably never
[11:42] would take
[11:43] communion so so you know if we just all
[11:48] felt we all going to feel unworthy
[11:52] today but there's got to come a time to
[11:54] where we're going to take the ordinance
[11:55] every first Sunday of every month that

[18:25] with ones that the sick continue to
[18:27] touch the ones Lord that are that are
[18:29] homebound Lord that can get them to

[18:42] with us Lord as we leave and take our
[18:46] week of work Lord may you it not be a a
[18:50] as we say a a dreary Monday Lord but
[18:52] it'll be a a resurrection time that
[18:54] we've learned something from you today
[18:57] Lord and we take it in and apply it to
[18:58] our life father just give us this day
[19:01] our daily bread in Jesus
[19:02] name amen all right part 137 in the
[19:06] beginning was the word word was with God
[19:08] and the Word was God and that word was
[19:10] made flesh that's what we're trying to
[19:11] head to because
[19:13] look when we look at the dispensations
[19:16] of God all right now God brother Brown
[19:19] said God was a dispensationalist and he
[19:21] was a dispensationalist okay so we are
[19:24] dispensationalist CU you and I live in
[19:26] the dispensation of the son of man right
[19:28] and the dispensation of adoption but it
[19:31] wasn't required I'll read it to you in
[19:32] just a little little while this is not
[19:34] required what this was required this is
[19:36] not required what this one's required
[19:38] but you and I are required to make that
[19:41] Word Flesh in the end time not working
[19:45] under the Son of God anointing but under
[19:48] the son of man anointing which is Jesus
[19:50] back in flesh here on the
[19:52] earth like brother Bram said not praying
[19:56] for the sick talking to theck sick all
[20:00] right that scares people I don't know
[20:02] why you don't just it it ought to it it
[20:05] ought to make you to where you know it's
[20:08] not the power and it's power with
[20:10] character CU brother Brown talks about
[20:12] power with character he does talk about
[20:13] power without character is satanic but
[20:15] Power with character is what fit to rule
[20:18] so you what start ruling yourself first
[20:21] then rule your family and rule the
[20:23] surroundings and rule the situation that
[20:25] you're in all right so that's why that
[20:27] we're heading toward
[20:28] son of man The Headstone because listen
[20:31] there wasn't a time in Jesus's life on
[20:33] this Earth that he was not in
[20:35] control right oh no on the cross no that
[20:38] he was the most controlled on the cross
[20:41] than he had ever been his whole life he
[20:43] controlled his own death that's
[20:46] right he hung for three
[20:48] hours he should have died for what they
[20:51] did to him but he gave us the
[20:53] ghost so nobody killed him he gave his
[20:57] life as the Bible says say he gave his
[20:59] soul a ransom so he could see what see
[21:02] his seed and the Word was made flesh and
[21:04] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[21:05] the glory of the only begotten of the
[21:06] father full of grace and truth you may
[21:09] be seated in the Lord as blessings to
[21:11] the reading of the
[21:12] word John 16:12 says I have many things
[21:16] to say to you but you cannot bear them
[21:17] now in other words there's a time in a
[21:19] place there's a time in a place in
[21:22] Preachers lives there's a time in place
[21:23] in your life there's a time in place in
[21:25] church there's a time in place in
[21:26] government there's a time in place all
[21:28] different things like we're talking
[21:29] about dispensations so there was a time
[21:31] that Jesus was standing on Earth and
[21:33] nobody understood who he was no
[21:35] one even the 12 that were around him and
[21:38] one of them was fixing to betray him
[21:40] here in just a little bit when we take
[21:42] communion all right none of the 11
[21:47] understood he knew that but he knew that
[21:50] he was going to give them a promise that
[21:51] he was going to come back in another
[21:54] form another
[21:56] dispensation he was was the son of man
[21:59] he was God in human flesh standing on
[22:01] Earth and nobody understood who he was
[22:04] so don't you think for one minute that
[22:06] when the son of man stands back on the
[22:07] Earth again and a bride they going to
[22:09] understand
[22:10] them no listen there's going to come a
[22:14] time when that end time bride that takes
[22:16] a body change is not even going to be
[22:18] understood by the Bride
[22:26] of
[22:31] he proved all out through like like
[22:32] Jesus he's standing there nobody he says
[22:36] I have many things to say but you cannot
[22:38] bear them
[22:40] now brother R stood one day and he said
[22:44] it's gone from you I have many things to
[22:47] say unto you for six days I preach the
[22:49] seals to you and you cannot bear them
[22:52] now right it's exactly what he was
[22:55] saying you're not getting it so in other
[22:57] words if you're not not getting it John
[22:58] if Jesus says you're not getting it
[23:00] there's going to be a group that
[23:01] did I just believe that how be it when
[23:05] he the spirit of Truth Now what is that
[23:07] now that's another dispensation that's
[23:09] the dispensation of the Son of God where
[23:11] Jesus Christ comes now
[23:14] in the form of the Holy Ghost in your
[23:18] soul burst you into the body makes you a
[23:21] son and then we got to go to adoption
[23:23] because he will guide you into all truth
[23:27] you know I was reading the other day we
[23:28] was talking about um me and somebody
[23:31] else was talking about something we was
[23:33] talking about um you know you say well I
[23:35] don't I don't I'm I'm not going to go to
[23:37] church there because I don't like the
[23:38] song leader I don't like the song music
[23:40] or I don't like brother R said the only
[23:42] reason you leave a church is is if the
[23:43] pastor's off the word and if you can
[23:45] find somewhere else different that
[23:47] preaches I ain't talking about me I'm
[23:48] talking about the dispensation that
[23:50] we've been given that brother Dale's
[23:51] preached brother Mo preach brother Dale
[23:53] preached and for two years I've tried to
[23:55] keep everything together and and
[23:57] preaching the same thing that that well
[24:01] no it's okay but that then we've seen
[24:04] all
[24:05] truth when the seals are open that's all
[24:08] truth you go so set somewhere else and
[24:11] and and like I said before many times
[24:14] and I'm bragging on God because God is
[24:15] the one that gives us this not the devil
[24:17] I'm sure the devil's going to confuse us
[24:18] he's sure is going to poke a little
[24:20] confusion in here
[24:22] somewhere all right but you go take 20
[24:24] people out of the out of the um see you
[24:27] can that you take 20 people go down here
[24:29] to Gainesville bring 20 people send them
[24:31] down to
[24:32] church half of them will be gone before
[24:34] the service is over but they won't
[24:37] understand a word that we're saying now
[24:38] then you take another group you go take
[24:40] 20 denominational good Baptist good
[24:42] Methodist or whatever you want to say
[24:43] Pentecostal bring that group of 20 in
[24:46] here and set them down they're under the
[24:48] Christian
[24:49] dome right they're on the Under the Dome
[24:52] of Christianity and some of them believe
[24:53] on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt
[24:54] be saved but as far as understanding
[24:57] headstone
[24:58] headship son of man Ministry the seals
[25:01] the bows the plagues the Daniel 70 weeks
[25:04] all the different things the because
[25:05] they're going to bring their
[25:06] denominational Doctrine in that hell is
[25:09] eternal there's three
[25:11] Gods we were talking between Services
[25:13] you know they they to explain a trinity
[25:17] is
[25:18] hard to just say God is one that's the
[25:21] most simple thing you can ever say in
[25:22] your life God's one there's one God
[25:25] there's nothing before him there's n
[25:27] after him
[25:28] there's only one he doesn't look over
[25:30] here and get counsel from this one cuz a
[25:32] trinitarian counsil would be three
[25:34] people sitting there and they're getting
[25:35] counsel from each other God don't have
[25:38] to get counsel from no one cuz he's the
[25:40] only one he swears by no
[25:43] other right cuz he swore by himself so
[25:47] that's easy to understand the
[25:49] trinitarian doctrine is a little you
[25:50] know get a little off to one side or the
[25:53] other
[25:54] but he will guide you into Al truth amen
[25:59] if you want it you got to make yourself
[26:01] as what what did Brother ra say you got
[26:02] to be disciplined listen to the word of
[26:05] God Listen to What God Says forget about
[26:08] listen forget about your emotions how
[26:10] many times brother Dell tell us see we
[26:11] like to quote brother Dale when it when
[26:12] it affects us it's really nice and sweet
[26:15] but let me tell you what he said many
[26:17] many thousands of times he what do he
[26:18] where do he tell us to put our
[26:21] feelings where sit on them put them in
[26:24] the seat of your pants and sit down on
[26:26] them y maybe we ought to do that
[26:29] sometime how be it when he the spirit of
[26:32] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[26:34] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[26:37] and that's what we've been talking about
[26:38] he's not speaking of himself anymore he
[26:41] knows who he is but he wants the world
[26:43] to know who he is through a
[26:46] bride that's his plan I didn't make it
[26:49] he made it and it must be
[26:51] perfect and he will show you things to
[26:53] come in other words give you further
[26:56] Revelation day by day
[27:00] don't you ever thank God though when you
[27:01] when you when you're sitting listening
[27:03] to a service or or just uh even
[27:05] listening to somebody online or
[27:06] something or some brother El's past
[27:08] services and you go that's what that is
[27:11] well that's a revelation thank God for
[27:13] that that's something that the piece of
[27:15] the puzzle is being more clear and it's
[27:17] fitting together more in your life we
[27:21] always talk about bringing our little
[27:22] Els of fire together why don't we bring
[27:25] it in here and let it burn this place
[27:26] down right
[27:28] cuz listen that fire is a consuming fire
[27:31] it will not burn this building down I'll
[27:33] promise you that but it sure will burn
[27:35] the devil out I promise you that he
[27:38] hates that kind of fire never has liked
[27:40] that kind of
[27:41] fire devil went nowhere around when the
[27:43] Bush was burning in Moses's day he might
[27:47] have been later on but he wasn't
[27:48] standing right there cuz he said you
[27:50] take your shoes off cuz this ground is
[27:52] Holy today you've seen the fire of God
[27:56] and no matter how much that we try try
[27:57] to think we're right in saying a Creed
[27:59] or joining a church you're still what
[28:01] you were into you're actually born again
[28:03] the new birth is an experience something
[28:05] that takes place reason I keep saying
[28:09] that is that's where you got to begin
[28:10] from if you're not there you will not go
[28:14] any further up the statue of perfect man
[28:16] you will not get any of these virtues
[28:18] working in your life you will absolutely
[28:20] become
[28:23] confused and listen God didn't say he'
[28:25] lead you and guide you into all
[28:26] confusion no he said he lead you and
[28:29] guide you into all Truth All right so
[28:33] now watch on the first seal remember
[28:34] he's talking about a church and he's
[28:36] preaching and he go he stops for a
[28:37] minute he said I'm going to call you
[28:38] bride all right so we're going to
[28:39] separate that now look that was a young
[28:43] bride everybody with me cuz we're going
[28:46] to read in Revelations 19 where a wife
[28:47] comes into being and I'll show you in
[28:48] just a minute what the Bible says about
[28:51] that word wife all
[28:53] right I'm going to call you bride so
[28:55] there was a young group of people there
[28:57] was a a Young Bride setting there that
[28:58] was not
[29:00] mature they were babbling Pentecostal
[29:02] babies they weren't understanding what
[29:03] he said listen half of the people that
[29:05] you hear on those tapes ask brother
[29:08] George
[29:09] Smith half of those people that you hear
[29:11] on those tapes of different men and
[29:13] brothers that he was close to went out
[29:15] in denomination soon as he died went
[29:18] right back into the same place they were
[29:20] Banks Woods different ones like that
[29:21] they went right back into into the
[29:24] denominations cuz they were there for
[29:26] the EXC
[29:29] they were there for the bait they didn't
[29:32] get the hook right remember brother
[29:34] Brown said they was just bait on the
[29:35] hook all
[29:36] right so never since Jesus was on Earth
[29:39] that's why Satan's fighting so much he
[29:41] knows there's an opponent here that he
[29:43] can't figure out and I want him to be
[29:46] where he's the most frustrated person on
[29:48] the face of the Earth
[29:51] amen so he won't know what to do with us
[29:54] and we are a formidable opponent I say
[29:56] we're formidable oppon opponent if
[29:59] you'll just yield yourself to God in
[30:01] your in your individuality you will not
[30:04] that's why I said before if you start
[30:05] having problems the first thing Satan's
[30:07] going to tell you to do is what don't go
[30:09] to
[30:10] church don't listen to them people don't
[30:13] answer the phone when they call you
[30:15] hello
[30:16] somebody now does God would he be the
[30:19] one to tell you that then you know it's
[30:21] the devil talking to you all right
[30:24] Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of
[30:27] the body the church who is the beginning
[30:30] the firstborn from the dead now look we
[30:32] go back now to and I didn't bring it but
[30:34] Revelations
[30:35] 3:14 that is the lay out of seean church
[30:38] age but what did he tell us he says this
[30:40] is the beginning of the creation of God
[30:44] in other words the way God wanted to be
[30:46] created you say God yeah brother Ram
[30:48] said God
[30:52] right before he was God yes before the
[30:56] Eternal there only one man could tell us
[30:58] that and that's the man that went back
[30:59] into the mind of
[31:01] God but he's the head of the body of the
[31:03] church the beginning the first born you
[31:05] know why he's called the
[31:09] firstborn go Adam wasn't born number one
[31:11] right and there was nobody
[31:15] Birthright since
[31:18] him everybody with me don't fall
[31:22] asleep that's why he's the firstborn but
[31:24] now listen him being the firstborn means
[31:27] that there others to be born all right
[31:30] if he's the beginning of the creation of
[31:32] God how in the world can Jesus be the
[31:34] beginning of the creation of God he was
[31:36] what God wanted to do to himself in the
[31:39] Garden of Eden had there not been a fall
[31:42] he would have produced the body that's
[31:44] right brother Brown said eve would have
[31:46] produced the body of Jesus and he would
[31:48] have just stepped right into it that's
[31:51] the beginning of the creation of God
[31:52] that's the birth that you and I are
[31:54] looking for that now he's birthing him
[31:57] self inside of me and
[31:59] you and he becomes the head of that body
[32:02] that's right amen the beginning the
[32:04] first born from what from the dead that
[32:07] in all things he might have the
[32:09] preeminence for it pleased the father
[32:12] that in him should all fullness dwell
[32:15] now we'll get to a little bit later on
[32:17] not today where brother Brown tells us
[32:20] that we are now collectively the
[32:23] fullness of the godhead bodily the son
[32:24] of man Ministry the son of man in a
[32:27] multiple form will make up the fullness
[32:30] of the godhead bodily cuz there's never
[32:31] been that way
[32:33] before right that by with
[32:35] me Matthew 21 verse 42 this is what we
[32:39] were talking about this
[32:41] morning now Jesus is talking to him he
[32:43] stand say look did you ever read the
[32:44] scriptures he ought to know these people
[32:46] were Christians they were supposed to be
[32:49] the stone which the builders is rejected
[32:50] the same as become the head of the
[32:52] corner right this is the Lord's
[32:55] doing and it is marvelous in our eyes
[32:58] therefore say unto you the kingdom of
[33:01] God shall be taken from you we're
[33:02] talking about that this morning
[33:04] Israel and give to a nation bringing
[33:07] forth the fruits thereof I was thinking
[33:10] somebody was preaching the other day
[33:12] about how that Adam I mean Abraham and
[33:16] and uh not Sarah the other one Hagar got
[33:21] together and produced ishmail well
[33:22] that's what's fighting over there right
[33:24] now the ishmaelites
[33:27] have a kingdom God said they'd be
[33:30] prosperous God didn't just kick them out
[33:32] listen I don't care whether they kick
[33:34] her out in the desert with the kid God
[33:37] said I'm going to help you and I'm going
[33:38] to make you prosperous but you're going
[33:39] to be a wild child you're going to be
[33:41] against your brother all the time and
[33:43] that's what's happening over there now
[33:45] they're against each other because of
[33:47] the promised son the son that was made
[33:49] from the from the um free woman and then
[33:53] the one made from the Bond woman all
[33:54] right they're fighting each other
[33:55] because look they got got the same
[33:59] daddy you could never get them together
[34:01] that's why it's going to be turmoil
[34:02] until we come back in the Millennium and
[34:05] then the 12 tribes of Israel be raised
[34:07] up and we'll get to rule and Reign for a
[34:10] thousand years with them all right and
[34:12] you know what I believe they'll be able
[34:13] to teach us some stuff I believe we'll
[34:15] be able to teach them some things all
[34:16] right so it's going to be given to a
[34:19] nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
[34:21] so that's the Gentiles that's me and you
[34:24] and whosoever shall fall on this Stone
[34:25] shall be broken we'll get to this a
[34:27] little bit later but on whomsoever it
[34:29] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[34:31] so either you're going to fall on the
[34:33] stone or the Stone's going to fall on
[34:35] you all right you decide which one and
[34:37] we'll look at it maybe if we have time a
[34:38] little bit
[34:39] later the rising of the sun brother BR
[34:42] keep I keep telling you this because
[34:43] look there's a broad spectrum of brides
[34:46] and
[34:48] churches right I told you about one
[34:50] Israel was was Jehovah's bride brother
[34:54] Bram said the Baptist was the bride at
[34:57] one time but he had every time they went
[34:59] whoring or went after another Doctrine
[35:03] he put them away married another one put
[35:05] him away cuz he can do that he's a man
[35:07] if you commit adultery against your
[35:08] husband he can put you away and you can
[35:11] remarry but only in the Lord so brother
[35:15] so Jesus didn't
[35:16] marry
[35:18] prostitutes he wanted a bride so he's
[35:21] looking for that one to come that he can
[35:25] make that his
[35:28] wife everybody with me that's a sole
[35:31] purpose Brides brides churches Brides
[35:33] churches Brides brides Lord of Mercy but
[35:36] there's got to come one Hallelujah there
[35:38] has to come a real bride not that those
[35:40] others were false but they didn't
[35:42] continue
[35:43] on in the furth of the word they didn't
[35:45] take his word as the seed to what to
[35:48] bring forth children unto
[35:50] God they went as Eve did and got filled
[35:54] up with other seed denominational
[35:56] Doctrine
[35:57] all right but there must come one that's
[35:59] not only got mechanics but the Dynamics
[36:01] it makes the church live moving the
[36:04] power of his resurrection until we come
[36:06] to that place until we find that place
[36:08] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[36:11] Revelations
[36:13] 19:5 read this the other day and y'all
[36:16] have to excuse me I got new teeth and
[36:17] they get a little
[36:19] dry but I like them for 10 grand I ought
[36:22] to like them and a voice came out of the
[36:25] throne saying praise our God they're not
[36:27] going to fall out though they're in
[36:29] there praise our
[36:32] god brother collie was outside a few
[36:34] minutes ago and he was talking to me and
[36:36] his top teeth was falling out I said I
[36:39] got some poly grip if you need some he
[36:41] said I'm good what
[36:43] you as we get older we lose things okay
[36:47] teeth
[36:48] hair
[36:52] sents praise our go yeah s praise our
[36:56] God all ye his Saints and you that fear
[36:58] Him both small and great now watch this
[36:59] is Revelations 19 and I heard as it were
[37:02] the voice of a great multitude I
[37:03] remember what is Revelations
[37:05] 19 it's when the bride is getting ready
[37:08] to ride back into the Millennium now
[37:10] she's been Justified Sanctified filled
[37:13] with the Holy Ghost come to
[37:19] adoption spoke a body change and a
[37:22] resurrection am went up for a marriage
[37:24] supper of three and A2 years yeah all
[37:27] right we're coming back in the
[37:28] Millennium as the wife not as the bride
[37:33] now watch it's going to be really neat
[37:35] to see what this word wife means when
[37:37] you look in a strong
[37:39] concordance and I heard it word the
[37:41] voice of great multitude as the voice of
[37:43] many Waters or many people and as the
[37:46] voice of Mighty thundering saying
[37:47] hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[37:50] reth let us be glad and rejoice give
[37:53] honor to him for the marriage of the
[37:55] Lamb is come and his wife wife hath made
[37:58] herself ready and to her was granted
[38:00] that she should be ar raay and fine
[38:02] linen clean and white for the fine linen
[38:04] is
[38:07] righteousness of
[38:10] saints so now I was looking online and
[38:12] this guy had a real good point I didn't
[38:15] have time to you know it's one of them
[38:16] things about this long but he's talking
[38:19] about a bride a bride can
[38:22] be before the
[38:24] wedding CU this your bride to be
[38:27] right and then when you have the
[38:28] marriage ceremony you're bringing your
[38:31] bride and he says you're only Bride for
[38:33] one
[38:34] day after that you're the
[38:37] wife cuz it's not the bride means the
[38:39] two are coming together the two are
[38:42] coming together the bride and the
[38:43] bridegroom are coming together all right
[38:44] well that's in your new birth that's
[38:46] coming together in the New Birth there's
[38:48] Brides brides churches Brides is going
[38:50] to come one what one bride that's going
[38:52] to continue on to this right here look
[38:54] at what the word wife means this word
[38:56] right here means in the Greek come to
[39:00] pass oh wow be
[39:05] done be
[39:07] complete arise be
[39:11] fulfilled listen brother Brown talks
[39:14] about an unfulfilled age the reason
[39:16] there's an unfulfilled age is because
[39:18] the word has not been brought back into
[39:20] Power this is not an unfulfilled age I
[39:25] declare to you today some body is going
[39:27] to fulfill everything that Jesus Christ
[39:29] had in his mind before the foundation of
[39:31] the world you can just figure out it's
[39:33] you or somebody else all
[39:35] right be fulfilled be married to look be
[39:40] preferred there's been Brides brides
[39:42] churches bride is going to come one and
[39:45] she's going to be preferred above all
[39:47] the rest now listen God's not going to
[39:50] forget Israel he's not going to forget
[39:53] the Baptist and the Methodist there
[39:55] going to be a lot of them in heaven oh
[39:57] but to have a bride that'll come that'll
[39:59] become a wife and make everything
[40:04] be
[40:07] fulfilled how satisfying is it you that
[40:11] are married and have been married how
[40:13] satisfied is it that when you come to a
[40:17] place to where it's like Mom and Dad
[40:19] always said you know as you get older
[40:20] you get you even get to look alike but
[40:23] you start thinking about something and
[40:24] and one turns to the other and say let's
[40:26] go Walmart and the other one's like I
[40:27] was thinking the same thing well you
[40:29] know that's that's humanly bringing the
[40:31] thing together what about God what about
[40:35] the communion with God if he's your
[40:37] husband right he's my husband I'm trying
[40:40] to become a wife to be a wife I've got
[40:42] to what fulfill all of his desire which
[40:45] is not down here we know it's all the
[40:48] other things but it's not sexual it's
[40:50] not anything like that it's doing what
[40:52] he
[40:53] said it's doing the word of God the way
[40:55] to please God is to do what he said yes
[40:57] amen listen we don't have to go learn 12
[41:01] years in in another 12 years in college
[41:03] and learn how to do this and learn how
[41:05] to do that we just got to learn how to
[41:06] do what he said already so this word
[41:09] wife means come to pass whatever he has
[41:12] given to the bride is going to be
[41:14] fulfilled or come to pass in that
[41:19] wife he was happy with the first church
[41:22] age that's his bride but she wasn't ever
[41:26] a wife second Church age bride but never
[41:30] a wife all the way down to this age
[41:33] bride but never a wife now his wife is
[41:36] now making
[41:38] herself ready now it didn't say he was
[41:41] making us ready so there's something you
[41:44] and I got to
[41:45] do read the book of
[41:48] Esther there's a little man kind of
[41:51] strange that Mori meant little little
[41:53] man and brother rown was about what 5'2
[41:55] 53 be man
[41:57] okay but remember Mori told
[42:02] Esther that hey you go do this but
[42:05] Esther had to go in and put the clothes
[42:09] on but he was telling her he was he was
[42:12] giving her Secrets telling her how to
[42:14] you know what to do but she has to be
[42:16] the one to go put them on she had to be
[42:19] the one that her life was at stake
[42:21] because the the the king all he had to
[42:24] do was say kill her I didn't call for
[42:25] her
[42:27] he'd not seen her for 30 days and then
[42:30] all of a sudden she knew listen wife she
[42:33] knew what to put on to make sure that
[42:36] King wasn't going to kill
[42:38] her she knew what kind of dress she knew
[42:41] how to walk she knew how to do her hair
[42:43] come on somebody she knew how to do that
[42:45] before she went in the court because to
[42:48] go in the court any other way was
[42:53] death read the book of Esther we've done
[42:55] it many many times and did some some
[42:58] studies on it but you just read it
[42:59] yourself is totally the characters of
[43:02] right now were the characters of back
[43:04] then and and you know
[43:08] what God was not mentioned one time in
[43:10] the Book of
[43:11] Esther it was all
[43:14] about the bride amen it was all about
[43:18] the bride and the little man that gave
[43:20] her the
[43:21] secret to continue on in her life amen
[43:25] and then of Israel was saved because of
[43:27] her well guess what when you and I get
[43:29] out of here Israel will be saved because
[43:31] we're gone and they're going to receive
[43:33] the same message that we receive they're
[43:35] going to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[43:37] and they're going to take a Rapture
[43:39] after they're killed all right everybody
[43:40] with me Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is
[43:43] quick powerful sharper than the
[43:44] two-edged sword is what we talking about
[43:46] this morning piercing even to the
[43:48] dividing a sun of Soul and Spirit and
[43:49] Joint Mar and as a discerner of the
[43:52] thoughts and intents of the heart that's
[43:54] why you see a preacher up here every
[43:55] once in a while they'll get to preach in
[43:56] a way and and they'll turn and say
[43:58] something that you'll think man that
[44:00] wasn't and you'll even say that wasn't
[44:02] even in my notes well that was a
[44:04] discerner that was God Discerning not me
[44:06] looking over there on top of your head
[44:08] and this television open up like in
[44:10] brother R's day it would open up and it
[44:11] would tell them their life the word is
[44:14] what doesn't it right the word's what
[44:17] opened up the the the life to the to the
[44:20] prophet amen all right so the word is
[44:22] what's going to discern the thoughts and
[44:24] intents of the heart right
[44:26] as I've always said before and I hate
[44:28] this and I hate to say we've got more
[44:29] people taking communion now than ever oh
[44:32] communion Wine's almost
[44:34] done it was a
[44:36] success amen you'll
[44:39] see but anyway so just want to throw
[44:41] that in there I'm kind
[44:45] of cuz I really was
[44:48] scared literally got on my knees and
[44:52] brother Joe Canada were doing a a video
[44:54] of it so that we can put the ingredients
[44:57] and all you know you get it your
[44:59] ingredients on a piece of paper we got
[45:02] it from Jeffersonville actually from the
[45:03] Tabernacle how to make it but every time
[45:06] that there's a step brother Joe has come
[45:08] and we've done a video so it's going to
[45:10] be out online to where people can make
[45:12] their own communion wine and not have to
[45:13] buy that junk that's got yeast and
[45:15] everything else in it out in the world
[45:17] and we thank God that brother Dell
[45:18] decided to do that 50 some odd years ago
[45:22] and we've never had to buy communion
[45:23] wine here we've always had it made by
[45:26] holy hands that's why Sister Lisa makes
[45:28] the bread made by holy hands we don't
[45:30] have to buy it from the outside don't
[45:32] hold it over brother Ryan takes at home
[45:34] and burns it so um we trying to do
[45:37] everything we can to make sure even the
[45:39] little things are done right okay so we
[45:41] sure do appreciate you but but but when
[45:43] you start standing up and you get ready
[45:44] to serve
[45:46] communion there's kind of a it's kind of
[45:48] like Israel out of Egypt there's an
[45:50] exit there's some people just can't take
[45:53] it they just can't take communion so
[45:54] they exit out the door I hope don't do
[45:57] that even if you don't take communion
[45:59] stand here and say God I want to do this
[46:04] ordinance but like I said before don't
[46:06] sit there and beat yourself up that you
[46:08] know you might have snapped at your wife
[46:09] you might have you know you might have
[46:11] slapped a neighbor's dog or you might
[46:13] you
[46:15] know I'm not saying that by
[46:18] experience but
[46:22] um say God forgive me and take Comm
[46:26] that's right in your soul see in your
[46:29] soul is where you're taking that from
[46:31] see I'm off on a little on a little side
[46:33] note but in your soul is where you're
[46:35] taking it if you if you took your memory
[46:37] reason conscious effects and Imagination
[46:39] we'd all never take it what the devil
[46:43] piles in on us all the time but you got
[46:45] to deny all that do the best you can and
[46:49] God said do this till I come and like I
[46:52] said many times before in foot washing
[46:54] everybody likes to take communion then
[46:55] leave footwash and Jesus said if you
[46:57] don't do this you'll have no part with
[46:58] me now how much stronger can you be than
[47:01] that if you don't do he said Peter if I
[47:03] don't wash your feet you'll have no part
[47:05] with me so every ordinance is the
[47:07] ordinance that we need to to uh partake
[47:10] of and I know some have uh feet that
[47:12] have feet issues and stuff and we
[47:14] understand that but I mean every time
[47:15] after every time after every time listen
[47:17] your feet don't hurt first Sunday of
[47:19] every
[47:23] month you'll go to work the next day and
[47:25] you're
[47:31] like like I said about people can't come
[47:33] to church they can go take a vacation
[47:35] and be gone for a week and they get in
[47:36] the car and they ride and they have all
[47:37] kind of Hallelujah time but I can't sit
[47:39] an hour in church I just can't do
[47:42] that well get born again you will that's
[47:46] just bottom line like the brother said
[47:48] if you if you're born again you'll come
[47:50] to church if you don't you won't and if
[47:52] you're a m believer you'll do it every
[47:54] once in a while
[47:56] right so your soul is the is the real
[47:59] you that's the person that's going to
[48:02] have to give an
[48:03] account that's what God's going to judge
[48:06] he's not going to judge your
[48:08] flesh he's going to judge your
[48:10] soul he said don't worry about the guy
[48:12] that can kill your flesh you worry about
[48:14] the guy that can kill the soul all right
[48:17] cuz so now look if you receive the soul
[48:19] of almighty God at the new birth God
[48:22] can't kill
[48:24] God so you're safe am amen but the ones
[48:27] that have to go to the white Throne
[48:29] judgment and have to give account for
[48:30] their deeds and their
[48:33] Works scare you to
[48:35] death scares me thinking about
[48:38] it right then the spirit realm that's
[48:42] the one we're going to have the problem
[48:43] with that's the one that God has give us
[48:45] a new birth at Faith then we have to add
[48:48] all these things to us and that comes
[48:51] from or emanates from the soul but it
[48:53] pushes out it's whatever you can white
[48:55] dog black dog whichever one wins is the
[48:58] one that you push and you
[49:02] feed unclean Spirit goes
[49:05] out Book of Luke unclean Spirit goes out
[49:08] of a man walks dry places comes back
[49:10] sees a house swept and garnished and if
[49:12] you ain't got the door shut he going to
[49:14] walk right back in the house well that's
[49:16] the same way with when you get born
[49:18] again same thing he turns right around
[49:20] and he he's you got doors IND doors
[49:22] brother R said you let God in your house
[49:24] but you won't let him in this room or
[49:25] you won't let him in that
[49:27] room we better let him in all of them I
[49:30] thought we lived under an open door
[49:32] policy amen so if we got the open doors
[49:35] in the word of God we ought to have an
[49:36] open door to let God in all right so
[49:39] Ephesians 1 ver4 says according as he
[49:41] has chosen Us in him before the
[49:42] foundation of the world that we should
[49:43] be holy and Without Blame now this is
[49:45] what he's saying about me and you
[49:48] sure that we should be holy and Without
[49:51] Blame before him in love having
[49:53] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:55] children so there's a group of people
[49:57] that he has predetermined by for
[49:59] knowledge that they would want it so
[50:02] much he puts you right here he put you
[50:05] right here in this age to make you
[50:07] available cuz he' have put you in any
[50:09] other age you wouldn't have been
[50:10] available for
[50:11] it this age right
[50:14] here good or
[50:17] bad according to the good pleasure of
[50:19] his well and adoption remember adoption
[50:21] is not your birth so we got to separate
[50:22] that you can be born again and not come
[50:25] to adoption but you can't come to
[50:27] adoption without being born again you
[50:29] got to be in the family of God before
[50:32] you're considered for adoption all right
[50:35] and it's not adoption like the world
[50:36] does adoptions everybody with me cuz
[50:38] I'll get to it in just a minute and I'll
[50:40] tell you what adoption means as far as
[50:42] pertaining to the Old Testament and to
[50:44] the Jews they still do it
[50:46] today so adoption is second Peter we
[50:49] talked about it this morning so we'll
[50:50] not read it again but look he that lack
[50:52] these things is blind and can't see a
[50:53] far off you have basically cut yourself
[50:56] off from God even though you're born
[51:00] again but he that lackthe things is
[51:02] blind he can't see it for a forgotten he
[51:04] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[51:06] the rather Brethren give diligence to
[51:08] make your calling and election sure all
[51:10] right look you're
[51:12] placing God where should I be amen God
[51:17] what do you want me to be that's
[51:22] right for so an entrance shall be
[51:24] ministered to you so we we've got to
[51:26] have there's got to be a Ministry that
[51:28] helps us get
[51:29] there there had to be a Peter that stood
[51:33] and said add to your faith virtue to
[51:35] your virtue knowledge knowledge
[51:36] Temperance there had to be a man there
[51:39] had to be somebody to give this out to
[51:43] you so you can so you can see it amen
[51:47] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[51:49] you always in remembrance of these
[51:50] things though you know them and be
[51:52] established in the
[51:54] present present
[51:57] truth Matthew 17:5 we read it this
[51:59] morning Jesus is coming up to almost
[52:02] about 6 months before they put him on
[52:03] the cross and God takes him up a
[52:06] mountain and says you hear this
[52:08] guy now that doesn't mean we can't don't
[52:10] hear the rest of
[52:13] it but Matthew 24 was that's Matthew 17
[52:16] brother Ram showed us in Matthew 24
[52:19] Jesus preached the seals so he had to be
[52:22] adopted before he could preach the seals
[52:24] in Matthew 24 amen everybody with me
[52:26] right okay we know this brother Dale
[52:29] taught us this for years he preached the
[52:30] seals in 1982 to the best of my
[52:32] knowledge as good as I've ever heard
[52:36] that was in
[52:38] 1982 that's brother Bo that's one you
[52:40] were talking about the 60 something
[52:41] tapes but you ought to listen to
[52:44] him so brother brother R said look after
[52:47] that son was adopted we're going to get
[52:48] to it his name on the checkbook was just
[52:50] as good as his
[52:51] daddy's that's where God's trying to get
[52:53] his church so he's trying to get us to
[52:56] that all right now if God's trying to
[52:59] get us to get there there's got to be
[53:00] somebody that wants to get there cuz
[53:03] he's not going to say it and nobody get
[53:04] there all right the whole creation is
[53:07] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[53:08] of the sons of God waiting to a spot to
[53:10] where that the sickness will be arise
[53:12] and it will be that way the blind will
[53:13] receive their sight deaf and dumb we
[53:16] pray for them now but then you'll
[53:18] command
[53:20] it right don't be scared of that amen
[53:24] don't be scared of that
[53:25] that remember what somebody said one
[53:27] time said well you speak the word what
[53:29] if it doesn't happen what if it
[53:32] does what if it does if it doesn't it
[53:35] was you if it does it was him that's all
[53:36] you got to say if you say to this
[53:39] mountain not if I say if you say to this
[53:41] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[53:42] your heart that's why I said before
[53:44] that's why brother Ram had to be taken
[53:45] out of the way because it's got to be
[53:47] the voice in The Bride the bride's got
[53:49] to be the one that comes to adoption and
[53:51] be able to do this mountain be moved mov
[53:55] D and not have to say well let's just
[53:58] let's let's see what brother bram's got
[53:59] to say about it we do see what he's got
[54:01] to say about it 1100 sermons but he
[54:04] didn't say he didn't say if I say right
[54:06] there look not if I say if you say to
[54:11] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[54:12] in your heart what we need is adoption
[54:16] Sons and Daughters needs adoption but
[54:19] how can the church the Pentecostal
[54:21] Church Methodist Church be adopted until
[54:23] they come to discipline we've got to be
[54:25] disciplined first we read that this
[54:26] morning so what do we need for adoption
[54:29] discipline because listen when I start
[54:31] reading this about Bar Mitzvah and about
[54:33] all the things of adoption it is
[54:35] discipline all right Romans 8 8:21 says
[54:39] because the creature itself also shall
[54:41] be delivered from the bondage of
[54:43] corruption and the Glorious Liberty of
[54:44] the children of God for we know that the
[54:46] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[54:48] pain together until now and not only
[54:51] they but ourselves also which have the
[54:53] first fruits of the spirit we talking
[54:54] about this morning
[54:56] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[54:58] what waiting for the adoption listen
[55:00] Paul's waiting for somebody to fulfill
[55:03] that scripture to wit or to witness or
[55:07] to be part of the Redemption of the body
[55:09] all right do you know that word to wit
[55:12] has been used five times in the Bible
[55:14] and there's no there's no um Greek or
[55:18] there's nothing in the lexican there's
[55:19] no underline in that they don't know how
[55:22] to interpret
[55:24] it
[55:26] but if you'll continue on and look at it
[55:28] you can see that that to W to
[55:30] witness because we know that see see the
[55:33] the church agents would go to wit what
[55:35] does that mean the Redemption of the
[55:36] body waiting for adoption but you and I
[55:39] when we're saying waiting for adoption
[55:40] that's us to Wi or to witness or to be
[55:43] standing here listen if you don't pass
[55:45] away you're going to either be part of
[55:48] it are you going to see it one of the
[55:51] two amen everybody with
[55:53] me I I'd rather be part of
[55:57] it to
[56:00] witness the Redemption of this horrible
[56:04] thing that we call
[56:06] flesh Galatians 3:23 says but before
[56:09] Faith came we were kept under the law
[56:12] shut up into the faith which should
[56:14] afterwards be revealed now
[56:17] remember listen this wherefore the law
[56:20] was our school master all right teacher
[56:23] tutor to bring us to Christ right that
[56:28] we might be
[56:29] justified by faith but after that faith
[56:32] has
[56:35] come we're no longer under that school
[56:39] master all right for ye are now for all
[56:43] ye are all the children of God by faith
[56:46] in Christ Jesus for as many of you has
[56:48] been baptized into the into Christ have
[56:52] put on Christ there's neither Jew or
[56:54] Greek Bond or free male or female for
[56:57] you are all one now look pretty plain
[56:59] Paul you're all one in Christ all right
[57:02] no big guys no little use listen we're
[57:05] feminist in the
[57:06] body Us big great men with hair on our
[57:09] chest
[57:13] some but brother Brown said Faith had
[57:15] hair on his chest all right I'm quoting
[57:17] brother
[57:18] brown but we're all feminist in the body
[57:20] of Christ so we have a headship that's
[57:23] why there's got to be a headship and
[57:24] everything thing you do in Christianity
[57:25] there's a head then there's a body
[57:28] there's no neck that turns it there's no
[57:30] head above a headen there's no two heads
[57:34] one head one body all right and if you
[57:38] be Christ then are you Abraham's seed
[57:40] and airs according to the promise and he
[57:43] continues speaking now man put Galatians
[57:46] 4 one in there but that's just a a
[57:49] letter that Paul wrote now I say he's
[57:52] continuing this thought that the heir
[57:54] now what is an
[57:56] heir all right Paul told us in Romans
[57:59] that we're Heir and join Heirs of Christ
[58:01] I'm an heir because if if something hen
[58:04] let's just say jun's mom died five years
[58:06] ago she's an air because she came from
[58:09] her all right she came forth from her
[58:11] and she is what she is privileged to
[58:14] have what
[58:16] she left that by with me but now brother
[58:20] Donnie was not called when they read the
[58:23] will neither was I but brother Donnie
[58:27] was not called because brother Donnie's
[58:29] not a not a Lineberry or not a
[58:33] Thomas he's not an air he could be given
[58:36] some things but he's not an heir an heir
[58:39] is a blood kin well Hallelujah when you
[58:42] get born again you're a blood K amen
[58:45] you're blood can to the
[58:48] almighty now I say that the heir as long
[58:50] as he's a child now look as long as he's
[58:52] a child differ nothing from from a
[58:56] servant though he be Lord of
[59:01] all cuz he's in the family he's got full
[59:04] Authority but no no no the daddy's not
[59:07] going to give him full Authority as a
[59:10] child but is under tutors and governors
[59:13] until the time appointed of the father
[59:17] now tutor is what one who's care or
[59:19] honors anything honor anything has been
[59:22] instructed a curator a guardian a Ste a
[59:25] manager of a household of land overseer
[59:28] one who has the care and tutelage of
[59:29] children either where the father is dead
[59:32] a guardian to minors or where the father
[59:33] still alive so it really doesn't matter
[59:35] if father's dead or Father's alive
[59:37] because in the Old Testament as we'll
[59:39] see in this bar mitzvah you're giving
[59:40] over to somebody and that person you
[59:43] know the father's his business is all
[59:45] this the whole kingdom is his business
[59:48] well the son don't get a part of he's
[59:50] he's air to all that Kingdom but he
[59:52] don't get it at first as the father's
[59:55] away I hope you get this as the father's
[59:58] away doing his
[1:00:00] business he sends a
[1:00:03] tutor the Holy Ghost he sends a
[1:00:06] tutor he sends a five-fold Ministry with
[1:00:10] the Holy Ghost I hope to teach that
[1:00:13] person his
[1:00:15] son then the Holy Ghost turns and say
[1:00:18] makes a report hey he needs a little
[1:00:21] work right here can I do this he needs a
[1:00:24] little work right here can I can I thump
[1:00:27] him on the head a little
[1:00:30] bit you start talking about that they'll
[1:00:32] put you in jail now man I tell you I I
[1:00:35] don't understand I know brother Mark and
[1:00:37] I are about the same age
[1:00:39] so I remember Miss
[1:00:41] Haron she was a rather big lady but she
[1:00:45] was not very tall but she went out to
[1:00:48] the EG bar and took a 2x6 everybody know
[1:00:52] what a 2X six is it's 2 Ines thick six
[1:00:54] inches wide this is no lie and they
[1:00:57] formed her a paddle out of it looked
[1:01:00] like a baseball bat it was a handle
[1:01:03] where she could hold on to it are y'all
[1:01:05] listening to me kids
[1:01:09] yeah yeah I'm won't preach made her a
[1:01:14] handle and not only made her a handle
[1:01:18] drilled holes in it so that your honey
[1:01:22] and that board didn't have there in
[1:01:25] between when she hit you it
[1:01:28] went and you went ah cuz she hit me one
[1:01:32] time I ain't going to tell you what she
[1:01:34] caught me doing but she rared back like
[1:01:37] a baseball player now do you believe
[1:01:39] look you take that scenario that
[1:01:40] happened all time when we were all
[1:01:41] growing up at this age put it
[1:01:48] today parental delinquency then not kids
[1:01:53] the parents
[1:01:55] oh no my listen when I was growing up
[1:01:58] that thing that innocent are proven
[1:02:00] guilty didn't work in our household did
[1:02:02] he no we were guilty until proven
[1:02:08] innocent and if you didn't tell the
[1:02:10] judge and the
[1:02:12] Executioner you can figure out whichever
[1:02:14] one that
[1:02:15] is you got a double shot cuz if they
[1:02:18] found out about it in your little
[1:02:20] community that that what wait went to
[1:02:22] the office and Mr White now Mr White
[1:02:25] here's another
[1:02:26] thing he had a I don't know if well they
[1:02:29] hardly don't do this anymore but they
[1:02:31] used to shave people and they had a
[1:02:32] straight razor and they used a a leather
[1:02:35] Brother Gary know they used a leather
[1:02:38] about this wide now look it wasn't like
[1:02:40] is this
[1:02:41] wi I'm preaching here for a minute and
[1:02:44] that thing's this
[1:02:46] thick and they had it on the side of the
[1:02:49] where you got up and they jacked you up
[1:02:50] it wasn't n this mashing the button they
[1:02:52] jacked you up like this you know
[1:02:53] pneumatic brought you up a little bit
[1:02:55] and he sit there and he well Mr White
[1:02:58] had one of them for a paddle and he
[1:03:00] didn't just need he didn't just one one
[1:03:03] lay one layer didn't work brother John
[1:03:05] he doubled
[1:03:06] it when he hit you he hits you
[1:03:11] twice so
[1:03:13] anyway I
[1:03:16] digress I remember every one of them
[1:03:20] should have got more but I'm a better
[1:03:22] man because of it
[1:03:26] but some of y'all don't even know what
[1:03:27] I'm talking about and you some of you
[1:03:29] parents are going I'd take them to court
[1:03:32] well that's why you have problems with
[1:03:33] your
[1:03:37] kids the prophet of God see that's why I
[1:03:39] say we pick our own little quotes that
[1:03:41] we want to use brother R said it was not
[1:03:43] juvenile
[1:03:45] delinquency even in the 60s he called it
[1:03:48] parental delinquency we allowed the kids
[1:03:52] to have that little
[1:03:56] and you dared the teacher to whip
[1:03:58] them well it's your fault then cuz mine
[1:04:01] sure didn't cuz I got one at home when I
[1:04:05] got one at school I got one at home all
[1:04:07] right double shot it wasn't love either
[1:04:10] well it was but at the time it didn't
[1:04:13] feel like
[1:04:14] it right and some of you don't even know
[1:04:17] nothing about
[1:04:19] it Where'd I go for this one Governor
[1:04:23] tutors and govern ERS the manager of a
[1:04:26] household or a household Affairs a
[1:04:28] steward in other words a manager
[1:04:30] somebody and that wasn't a manager in
[1:04:32] this case it wasn't a manager of of of
[1:04:34] money or anything it was a manager of
[1:04:36] that kid right that person he managed
[1:04:40] that kid and if that kid got off here
[1:04:42] there he was able to give it a little
[1:04:43] bit of
[1:04:44] stimulation to get it back in line but
[1:04:47] he would go tell the father he said look
[1:04:49] I had to spank him but he didn't
[1:04:52] Rebel and the father was like oh great
[1:04:56] but now what if you was one of those
[1:04:57] that you spanked and kept spanking and
[1:05:00] kept spanking and kept spanking and kept
[1:05:04] spanking and for the same thing he'd
[1:05:07] have to go back and tell the father said
[1:05:08] look I've done all I can do I don't know
[1:05:11] what to do about this okay then the
[1:05:13] father would take over I would
[1:05:16] assume so God gave us tutors and
[1:05:18] governors if we'll listen to them and we
[1:05:21] do need a spanking every once in a while
[1:05:23] we need a little bit of remembrance
[1:05:25] brother Brown called it protoplasmic
[1:05:29] stimulation I've always said there's a
[1:05:31] nerve in your rear that's connected to
[1:05:32] your head and if you hit that rear end
[1:05:34] hard enough it'll it'll help your
[1:05:37] head even so we when we were children
[1:05:39] let's get back to the sermon even so we
[1:05:41] when we were children we were in bondage
[1:05:43] under the elements of the
[1:05:45] world newborn babies in Christ you're
[1:05:48] under the elements of if you'll remember
[1:05:51] and be honest with yourself when you be
[1:05:52] even when you come to the church and you
[1:05:54] come under justification and
[1:05:56] sanctification you are a
[1:06:03] legalist I don't do that no more why
[1:06:05] they still doing it Go sound like Aaron
[1:06:07] never mind so here we go so when we were
[1:06:10] children we were inod he'll see this
[1:06:13] under the elements of the world but when
[1:06:14] the fullness of time was come now look
[1:06:16] when is the fullness of time now there's
[1:06:19] no more time after this that's right
[1:06:22] Bible say times will be no longer not
[1:06:24] here but when the fullness of time was
[1:06:27] come God sent forth his son made of a
[1:06:29] woman made under the law listen
[1:06:32] Everything Jesus did was under the law I
[1:06:35] mean he would heal somebody and said hey
[1:06:37] go do the law of Moses hey go tell your
[1:06:39] priest check out that leprosy and make
[1:06:40] sure he couldn't come he was the
[1:06:44] law but it was a law made manifest in
[1:06:46] human flesh that could live
[1:06:49] iten how many times you well I can't
[1:06:51] live those Ten Commandments yeah you can
[1:06:53] amen if you get the one that wrote him
[1:06:55] inside of you you can but when the
[1:06:57] fullness of time was come God for sent
[1:06:59] forth his son made of a woman under the
[1:07:01] law what to redeem them that were under
[1:07:03] that
[1:07:04] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:07:08] of sons and because you are Sons God has
[1:07:11] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:07:13] your hearts crying father father or ABA
[1:07:16] father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[1:07:19] servant all right now you've moved from
[1:07:21] from what we were talking about here
[1:07:22] that servant and the a was doing the
[1:07:25] same thing played the same playground
[1:07:27] went to the same school doesn't matter
[1:07:29] if one had the whole the whole backing
[1:07:31] of Heaven let's just say was in this
[1:07:35] kid's
[1:07:36] possession if he' behave himself if he
[1:07:39] didn't he was still a son he still got
[1:07:41] part of the of the
[1:07:43] Airship but he was taught under tutors
[1:07:47] and governors and then what did he do he
[1:07:50] graduated he come on up wherefore Thou
[1:07:52] Art no more a servant but a son son if a
[1:07:54] son then an heir of God through
[1:07:57] Christ so let's look at this just for a
[1:08:01] second this word is Bar Mitzvah now if
[1:08:03] you
[1:08:04] look back in the Hebrew you'll see that
[1:08:08] the Bible's written where that or maybe
[1:08:12] the Greek in the New Testament that this
[1:08:15] was the son of Jonas our Simon bar Jonah
[1:08:20] bar means son
[1:08:21] of Simon the son of Jonah all right so
[1:08:25] bar means son
[1:08:27] of and Mitzvah also spelled Bar Mitzvah
[1:08:31] without the H or
[1:08:33] mitzah it means son of the
[1:08:37] Commandment so now you're the son of the
[1:08:39] Commandment what is the Commandment what
[1:08:41] is our commandment be adopted amen
[1:08:45] what's our what's our what's our
[1:08:47] commandment come to the fullness what's
[1:08:50] our commandment know what to do with the
[1:08:51] word at any time brother Bown says
[1:08:53] that's our commandment that's our
[1:08:55] mandate that's why God sent a prophet
[1:08:57] not to tell us to dress right and do
[1:09:00] right and eat right and not do this that
[1:09:01] that was already in the Bible right
[1:09:04] right plural Bar mitzvas Bar Mitzvah bar
[1:09:08] mitzah Jewish religious ritual and
[1:09:11] family celebration commemorating the
[1:09:14] religious adulthood of a boy on his 13th
[1:09:18] birthday that's why you'll see that
[1:09:20] Jesus was in the temple at about that
[1:09:23] same
[1:09:24] age and they were allowing him to read
[1:09:27] they didn't know he was God he was just
[1:09:29] this boy that wandered in the in the
[1:09:31] into the sanctuary cuz you know what at
[1:09:34] 13 Jesus went to
[1:09:38] church at 30 Jesus went to church right
[1:09:43] right so they found him in
[1:09:46] church coming to this place to where he
[1:09:49] could read the Torah cuz listen it's not
[1:09:53] like me and you just reading the book
[1:09:54] and throwing it on a shelf that Torah to
[1:09:56] them is is almost God because it's what
[1:09:59] God said they they count it totally
[1:10:02] reverent they they they preserve it they
[1:10:05] they don't even can't even spell the
[1:10:07] word
[1:10:08] god remember it's g/ D they can't they
[1:10:11] don't even want to say that word it's so
[1:10:14] reverent so it's not something that you
[1:10:16] just let any 13y old boy that comes in
[1:10:18] there you
[1:10:19] know I don't really care but I'll read
[1:10:22] this no he was a proper child they knew
[1:10:24] that they knew that when he walked in
[1:10:26] there that somebody had taught him well
[1:10:28] cuz remember when he got in there he
[1:10:29] said I must be about what my father's
[1:10:33] business not the carpenter
[1:10:35] man the boy look now deemed personally
[1:10:39] responsible for fulfilling all the
[1:10:42] Commandments H at
[1:10:46] 13 May henceforth Dawn fatores now most
[1:10:51] of you don't know what that is but it's
[1:10:53] it's if you see the Jewish people they
[1:10:55] have ropes of different color they have
[1:10:57] a thing around their arm of different
[1:10:59] color and it it it tells kind of what
[1:11:01] they are and and what level they're at
[1:11:04] all right pharies which is religious
[1:11:06] symbols worn on the forehead and the
[1:11:08] left arm during the week day morning
[1:11:11] prayer and may be counted as an adult
[1:11:13] whenever 10 male adults are needed to
[1:11:15] form a quarum for public prayer so he's
[1:11:19] very
[1:11:20] important that's a bar mitzvah
[1:11:24] that's the
[1:11:26] adoption that's what you and I are
[1:11:27] looking
[1:11:29] at because the
[1:11:31] father is the one that brings the son
[1:11:33] out and I'm going read the rest of it
[1:11:35] because it's a big old long thing they
[1:11:36] have this ceremony put him out you know
[1:11:39] and parade him down the street and give
[1:11:40] him all kind of beautiful robe to put on
[1:11:42] and all this stuff that's what God's
[1:11:44] want to do with me and
[1:11:48] you he's not going to put a listen let
[1:11:51] me be real he's not going to put a baby
[1:11:53] with with diapers on a
[1:11:57] parade that can't even eat for itself no
[1:12:00] he's going to put somebody that he can
[1:12:02] depend on that he's proud of that he
[1:12:05] wants to be there that has come to
[1:12:07] maturity he's going to parade them
[1:12:10] around this world he is already doing
[1:12:13] that now there's Believers in every age
[1:12:16] every every um
[1:12:19] Nation we're just not collected together
[1:12:21] yet we get collected together we're
[1:12:23] going home I don't mean collected
[1:12:26] together they all got to come right here
[1:12:27] you understand what I mean all come to
[1:12:29] the same level same
[1:12:31] Revelation the believer's position in
[1:12:33] Christ now in the spiritual sense after
[1:12:35] we were born now look after we were born
[1:12:37] into Christ we become children of God
[1:12:40] but then see God knows best
[1:12:43] right now this boy after he got a
[1:12:46] certain age he had to be adopted into
[1:12:48] that same family he was born into any
[1:12:51] Minister knows that that's the placing
[1:12:54] of a son he had to be adopted into the
[1:12:56] family that he was born
[1:12:58] into so you got to be born again in the
[1:13:01] line for adoption we've said that many
[1:13:03] times before could you imagine that but
[1:13:06] that's the Old Testament teaching Paul's
[1:13:08] referring to it here in Ephesians the
[1:13:10] Church of Ephesus now when the father
[1:13:13] become aware that this boy was not
[1:13:15] worthy now here's the other
[1:13:17] side cuz they're not going to let a
[1:13:19] renegade go into the temple and read out
[1:13:21] of them Scrolls they those scrolls are
[1:13:26] sacred all
[1:13:28] right he never disowned
[1:13:31] him he was still his son but he couldn't
[1:13:34] put confidence in
[1:13:36] him and let me just be
[1:13:39] plain he's not going to use you for
[1:13:42] much like I said who's he going to put
[1:13:44] on display his wife
[1:13:49] yes but he couldn't put confidence in
[1:13:51] him he was too carried about with all
[1:13:53] all kinds of Winds of What
[1:13:56] doctrine that's what the scripture says
[1:13:59] be not carried about with every wind of
[1:14:00] Doctrine be stable stabled always
[1:14:03] abounding in the works of the Lord for
[1:14:05] so much as you know your works is not in
[1:14:07] vain quickly wish we could stay on that
[1:14:09] a little while but notice the day come
[1:14:11] when this boy maybe he had been all
[1:14:13] right he was a worthy
[1:14:15] man he listened to the father he took
[1:14:20] instructions he was a good boy
[1:14:24] then the father taken him out into the
[1:14:26] public Street and then he put a special
[1:14:28] clothes on him and then the father had a
[1:14:31] ceremony and adopted this his son into
[1:14:34] his
[1:14:35] family and then this son after he came
[1:14:38] out there was given no longer was he
[1:14:40] just like the servant under the tutor
[1:14:42] he's going back to scripture there in in
[1:14:44] Galatians he was the
[1:14:46] boss amen I hope this sink soaks real
[1:14:50] deep he was the boss
[1:14:53] yes let's get way down deep where a lot
[1:14:57] of people don't go this son was no more
[1:15:00] under a tutor but he was like his
[1:15:03] father and his father gave him certain
[1:15:06] things to do the father might have told
[1:15:08] him you take care of this field over
[1:15:10] here or you going to do this over here
[1:15:13] you take care of the slaves you take
[1:15:15] care of whatever it was he was in full
[1:15:17] possession amen he's getting the
[1:15:19] spiritual part of
[1:15:21] this for he was a adopted into that
[1:15:24] family and his name on a check was just
[1:15:26] as good as his daddy's now what God has
[1:15:29] done the reason we see these things and
[1:15:31] know that there's something wrong friend
[1:15:33] look something
[1:15:35] wrong something
[1:15:37] wrong we see the promises of
[1:15:41] God we see it in the word of
[1:15:44] God but God has just began begun begin
[1:15:48] to my humble opinion to adopt his son
[1:15:51] now this is 19
[1:15:59] 55 what is this 20 almost
[1:16:09] 2024 we see the promises of God we see
[1:16:12] it in the word of God but God has just
[1:16:14] begun to my humble opinion to adopt his
[1:16:16] son positionally calling him out to one
[1:16:18] side giving him a certain Ministry
[1:16:21] anointing them for that
[1:16:24] purpose and sending them out watch what
[1:16:28] happens when he
[1:16:30] does Ephesians 1 ver4 according to he as
[1:16:33] chosen I want you every time we have
[1:16:36] this U part that I've got in yellow read
[1:16:39] it with me maybe it'll wake some of you
[1:16:42] up so I'm sorry wake up we're going to
[1:16:44] read
[1:16:45] this according as he has chosen Us in
[1:16:49] him before the foundation of world
[1:16:51] that that's weak
[1:16:55] this is your
[1:16:57] inheritance I get excited about my
[1:16:59] inheritance amen that we should be holy
[1:17:03] and Without Blame before him in love
[1:17:05] having predestinated
[1:17:07] us not somebody else us unto the
[1:17:10] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:17:12] what to himself to make sure it's going
[1:17:15] to
[1:17:17] happen he's not giving it to a second
[1:17:19] person or a third person of the Trinity
[1:17:22] he's doing it according to the good
[1:17:25] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[1:17:27] the glory of his grace wherein he hath
[1:17:28] made us
[1:17:31] accepted and the Beloved amen wow in
[1:17:34] whom I didn't do this one but in whom we
[1:17:37] have Redemption through his blood the
[1:17:40] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:17:41] riches of his grace wherein he ha what
[1:17:43] here's that word again abounded toward
[1:17:46] us in all wisdom and Prudence have he
[1:17:49] made known unto us the mystery of what
[1:17:53] he wants Done Right his
[1:17:57] will according to his good pleasure
[1:17:59] which he has purposed in himself that in
[1:18:03] a dispensation of the fullness of times
[1:18:05] what 2,000 years now
[1:18:07] today he might gather together in one
[1:18:10] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:18:11] heaven which are on earth even in him
[1:18:14] whom
[1:18:15] also one more time we have obtained an
[1:18:20] inheritance remember Jesus didn't come
[1:18:22] to bring bring us an
[1:18:24] inheritance nope he did not he came to
[1:18:28] get us back to our inheritance our
[1:18:31] inheritance was before the foundation of
[1:18:32] the world now that's a direct quote from
[1:18:34] Brother random if you need it I if you
[1:18:36] need it I'll get it for
[1:18:38] you being predestinated according to the
[1:18:40] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:18:41] after the counsel of his own will that
[1:18:44] we should be what to the praise of his
[1:18:46] glory he loves
[1:18:48] us he wants to show the world us
[1:18:54] who first trusted in Christ in whom also
[1:18:58] trusted after that year we look after
[1:19:03] you heard the word of Truth you got to
[1:19:04] hear the word of Truth
[1:19:05] first if you just get told every Sunday
[1:19:08] that God sent a prophet and baptized the
[1:19:10] name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:12] and God sent a prophet and baptized the
[1:19:14] name of Lord Jesus Christ you're missing
[1:19:16] a whole
[1:19:18] light so in whom you trusted after that
[1:19:20] you heard the word of Truth the gospel
[1:19:23] of your salvation in whom also after
[1:19:26] that after that ye
[1:19:29] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[1:19:31] Spirit of Promise which is the earnest
[1:19:33] of our inheritance until the Redemption
[1:19:36] of the what what's the Redemption of The
[1:19:38] perous Possession it's not only your
[1:19:42] soul when he claims you he claims all of
[1:19:44] you I just believe that when he claims
[1:19:47] you he claims every bit of you all right
[1:19:49] unto the praise of his glory Matthew
[1:19:51] 21:42 this where we at this morning
[1:19:54] Jesus said unto them do you never read
[1:19:56] in the scripture the stone which the
[1:19:57] builders rejected now look Jesus we know
[1:20:00] was a master builder he was a sculptor
[1:20:03] all right he was building the
[1:20:05] church the same has become the head of
[1:20:07] the corner so now if they rejected the
[1:20:10] head they rejected the head which is him
[1:20:14] they rejected him he was the head where
[1:20:16] the body he's the head he's the headship
[1:20:19] he's the Chief Cornerstone and chief
[1:20:21] headstone he's chief of all right but he
[1:20:25] had to start right back down here on the
[1:20:27] day of
[1:20:28] Pentecost as a
[1:20:30] Cornerstone of the church to build it
[1:20:32] back up again all right we've been
[1:20:34] talking about that for a long time the
[1:20:37] same has become the head of the corner
[1:20:39] so he he never lost his
[1:20:41] headship
[1:20:44] right he just lost all that control up
[1:20:48] here but he started back down here
[1:20:50] because remember even in Paul's age
[1:20:54] excuse me John said you just started
[1:20:56] your age and you've already lost your
[1:20:58] first
[1:20:59] love they started denominate and having
[1:21:01] denominational ideas right there in the
[1:21:03] first church age when it was the
[1:21:04] fullness of the word of God Jesus had
[1:21:06] just been off the scene like years a few
[1:21:08] years they were already saying he wasn't
[1:21:10] God they were already saying that he was
[1:21:12] you know not Divine they were already
[1:21:14] saying these things sthus and different
[1:21:15] ones were making doctr that Jesus wasn't
[1:21:17] God until the River Jordan well we know
[1:21:20] that's not true Bible said he was born
[1:21:22] what Emmanuel God With Us that's good
[1:21:25] enough for me the same has become the
[1:21:28] head of the corner this is the Lord's
[1:21:30] doing and it's marvelous in our eyes
[1:21:32] therefore say I unto you the kingdom of
[1:21:34] God shall be taken from
[1:21:36] you and given to a nation bringing forth
[1:21:39] fruits thereof which is us the Gentiles
[1:21:42] and whosoever shall fall on this Stone
[1:21:44] shall be broken but on whomsoever it
[1:21:45] shall fall it will grind him to powder
[1:21:48] we'll we'll touch on that subject a
[1:21:49] little bit later on but I want you to
[1:21:51] watch who's whoever shall fall on this
[1:21:53] Stone what now look it says you'll be
[1:21:56] broken which would mean two pieces are
[1:21:59] broken but now whomsoever it shall fall
[1:22:03] it don't just break you it grinds you to
[1:22:06] Real Fine powder takes you right back to
[1:22:08] what you were before we'll get into that
[1:22:10] a little bit later but not not today
[1:22:12] Isaiah 28:
[1:22:15] 16 for those of you that uh are as old
[1:22:19] as I
[1:22:20] am and when Dad was bu building a house
[1:22:23] when we were building my house in
[1:22:25] 2002 we used
[1:22:28] lasers cuz man had developed the point
[1:22:30] where you can use a laser and we got my
[1:22:32] house like within like a quarter of an
[1:22:34] inch like for 300
[1:22:36] ft right and Corners we would get the
[1:22:40] corners just right with that
[1:22:42] laser but back in the old times you used
[1:22:44] a
[1:22:45] plummet it looked like a top almost with
[1:22:48] a with a string on the end of it and you
[1:22:50] would nail it down and it would drop and
[1:22:52] when it would drop like that that was
[1:22:54] where your point of start was right Plum
[1:22:58] Bob is what we call it trying to say
[1:23:00] plum called a plum
[1:23:02] buum well they Ed to Plum
[1:23:04] it so now but now remember if you don't
[1:23:07] get your foundation
[1:23:09] right see the person that built the
[1:23:11] house before we did in the
[1:23:14] 30s it was a foot off from one end of
[1:23:16] the House of the other when we set that
[1:23:18] thing down on the real Foundation that
[1:23:21] we had you know done by laser the
[1:23:24] windows wouldn't close the doors
[1:23:26] wouldn't
[1:23:27] shut the the um drywall cracked that's
[1:23:31] how bad off it was because they would do
[1:23:34] it with a lot of times they do it with a
[1:23:35] glass of
[1:23:37] water there was no such thing as this
[1:23:40] beautiful little level thing they put a
[1:23:42] glass of water in the middle of the room
[1:23:43] and if it was level it was level but it
[1:23:46] might not be over under but it is right
[1:23:48] there but
[1:23:50] listen you see what happened when it sat
[1:23:53] down on a firm foundation though it
[1:23:57] cracked nothing's
[1:23:59] fit now is that's a way to start a house
[1:24:02] no you know what we did we had to tear
[1:24:04] all that drywall out we had to take all
[1:24:06] the windows out we had to take all the
[1:24:08] doors out and reframe
[1:24:10] everything that's the same way with the
[1:24:12] word of God if we don't get our
[1:24:13] foundation
[1:24:15] right if we don't get our foundation
[1:24:17] right the building will not
[1:24:20] stand therefore thus sayith the Lord
[1:24:22] behold I land in line for a foundation a
[1:24:24] stone a tried Stone a precious
[1:24:27] Cornerstone a sure Foundation that he
[1:24:31] that believeth look shall not make haste
[1:24:35] judgment also will I lay to the line and
[1:24:37] righteousness to the plummet and the
[1:24:40] hail shall sweep away the Refuge of lies
[1:24:42] and the waters shall overflow the hiding
[1:24:43] places now watch you want to you want do
[1:24:47] you want a promise from the Old
[1:24:49] Testament that your appointment with
[1:24:52] death has been
[1:24:53] disol there it
[1:24:55] is Verse 18 and your Covenant with Death
[1:25:00] Shall be
[1:25:03] disol and your agreement with hell shall
[1:25:06] not stand amen yes you ought to
[1:25:09] underline that one in your Bible that
[1:25:11] would be Isaiah 28:16 and 18 your
[1:25:14] Covenant with Death Shall be dis know
[1:25:17] what when you get all this right amen
[1:25:19] when you get the foundation right when
[1:25:21] you get the walls up right
[1:25:23] amen and your Covenant with Death Shall
[1:25:25] be disano and your agreement with hell
[1:25:28] shall not stand when the overflowing
[1:25:30] scorge shall pass through in other words
[1:25:33] when what the enemy comes in like a
[1:25:36] flood God's already got a standard to
[1:25:39] raise
[1:25:40] up then you shall be Trot down by it the
[1:25:43] plummet means a level or a leveling tool
[1:25:45] or
[1:25:46] instrument all
[1:25:49] right what gets out of level false
[1:25:53] Doctrine I it's okay for me to do this
[1:25:57] you know what that's going to take you
[1:25:58] if it's not of God that
[1:26:03] way now let's read this real quick and
[1:26:05] then we'll we'll
[1:26:07] stop statue of perfect man is what we've
[1:26:09] been talking about for 130 something
[1:26:11] sermon he our Nations saying the things
[1:26:14] they are and making fun of these things
[1:26:16] and their own money the currency
[1:26:17] testifies that the
[1:26:19] Seal of the whole universe is God he's
[1:26:22] talking about the dollar bill if you
[1:26:23] turn the dollar bill over there's a
[1:26:25] pyramid with an eye on the top of it all
[1:26:27] right the allseeing
[1:26:29] eye all right see that eye standing up
[1:26:32] there above that on that dollar bill
[1:26:34] that's the Great Seal it never was put
[1:26:37] on the top of the pyramid they couldn't
[1:26:40] understand why the capping Stone was
[1:26:42] rejected the head Christ listen they
[1:26:45] couldn't take God in human flesh they
[1:26:47] didn't kill him for the for the good
[1:26:48] works he did they didn't kill him for
[1:26:50] the prayer lines they didn't kill him
[1:26:51] for that what they kill him for saying
[1:26:53] he was
[1:26:54] God right they killed him for saying he
[1:26:57] was God they're going to kill me and you
[1:26:58] maybe even kill our influence for saying
[1:27:00] that we're God made manifest in another
[1:27:02] form called a bride not a second person
[1:27:04] not a third person we're the person of
[1:27:05] God made manifest in another form called
[1:27:07] a
[1:27:08] bride now in building the virtues now
[1:27:10] look building this
[1:27:12] Monument building this stature see it
[1:27:16] starts off with the foundation stone
[1:27:19] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:27:20] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:27:22] now what does it do then we're waiting
[1:27:26] look wait now look this is all the
[1:27:29] virtues then we're
[1:27:32] waiting telling you what he said oh
[1:27:34] everybody believe God sent us a prophet
[1:27:36] okay just want to make sure that y'all
[1:27:38] had exit the building and somebody else
[1:27:39] come in now what does it do then they're
[1:27:41] waiting for the headstone which is love
[1:27:43] for God is love and he
[1:27:46] controls and what were we talking about
[1:27:48] brother brownan said discipline was what
[1:27:50] we're needing for the statute of perfect
[1:27:51] man for adoption discipline he controls
[1:27:55] and he is the strength of every one of
[1:27:57] these things that's right yes sir now
[1:27:59] look let's get I've been wanting to get
[1:28:01] to this for three weeks right in here
[1:28:04] right in here now he's pointing to the
[1:28:06] drawing that he's got on the board I'm
[1:28:08] sure he's got it on a chalk board all
[1:28:10] right right in here you see I got in
[1:28:13] between all these works now in the
[1:28:15] original
[1:28:17] picture there's waves coming down right
[1:28:21] here
[1:28:25] if you can find it we'll try to find it
[1:28:27] brother joob maybe you can find it the
[1:28:29] original picture that you drew there's
[1:28:30] little waves but why did he put that in
[1:28:33] there look in between all these Works in
[1:28:36] here here are these little waves come
[1:28:37] what is that the holy ghost look coming
[1:28:40] down through Christ see Holy Spirit now
[1:28:43] not the Holy Spirit at the bottom of the
[1:28:46] pyramid you've already got that right
[1:28:49] now we're looking at the fullness to
[1:28:51] where that
[1:28:52] that that gives you the
[1:28:55] seal now you're sealed in your soul at
[1:28:58] the day you're born again everybody with
[1:29:00] me you don't unseal it and seal it back
[1:29:03] up you're sealed until the day of your
[1:29:04] redemption in your soul so now God's
[1:29:07] working on our second realm memory
[1:29:09] reason conscious effects imagination to
[1:29:11] make it just like the soul
[1:29:16] realm hard to believe but that's exactly
[1:29:19] what adoption is and that's exactly what
[1:29:20] the change of body is going to take
[1:29:22] is that your memory is his memory come
[1:29:24] on somebody his thoughts are your
[1:29:26] thoughts his ways are your
[1:29:29] ways you said oh brother the Bible says
[1:29:31] we can't well the Bible just told us we
[1:29:34] were going to die and I think over there
[1:29:35] in Isaiah it says we're going to disan
[1:29:39] that doesn't the Bible tell us that we
[1:29:41] have an appointment with
[1:29:43] death right Bible says you have an
[1:29:45] appointment with death well you know you
[1:29:48] got a doctor appointment
[1:29:50] tomorrow you have to go
[1:29:53] just miss the
[1:29:56] appointment yeah that's how simple death
[1:29:58] is going to be destroyed just don't go
[1:30:00] to the appointment you've been appointed
[1:30:02] to die don't
[1:30:04] go the Bible says it's been disol don't
[1:30:08] away with don't have to go there anymore
[1:30:10] we just got to believe
[1:30:11] it the holy ghost coming down through
[1:30:14] Christ SE Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:30:16] above all this welding this together now
[1:30:19] welding everything cuz your souls
[1:30:21] already already
[1:30:22] welded so he's welding the rest of us
[1:30:25] together forget about the flesh it just
[1:30:27] does what the spirit tells it to do all
[1:30:29] right welding This Together building a
[1:30:31] what a perfect church for the what
[1:30:34] Capstone to cap it off and we'll get
[1:30:36] into that a little bit later but let's
[1:30:37] read this right
[1:30:39] here Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961
[1:30:42] we'll stop right here I ain't got time
[1:30:43] to get the rest of it what happened next
[1:30:46] then came the Pentecostal the baptism of
[1:30:48] the Holy Ghost now look and still the
[1:30:51] church got small smaller in the
[1:30:53] minority and now it goes on until that
[1:30:55] has to get to such a perfect
[1:30:58] place as human beings when we say the
[1:31:00] word perfect we go all as brother Bob
[1:31:04] says
[1:31:05] wonky we go all wonky fied I made it
[1:31:09] f because we go
[1:31:13] perfect I'm telling you what the Bible
[1:31:15] says the Bible tells us to be perfect
[1:31:18] tells us
[1:31:19] how now it goes on until that has to get
[1:31:22] so much a perfect place until when that
[1:31:25] headstone finally comes it'll fit so
[1:31:28] perfect the church will be have to be in
[1:31:30] such a perfect shape until when Christ
[1:31:34] comes he fits right down on
[1:31:39] it so you see just speaking in tongues
[1:31:42] and dancing in the spirit that's way
[1:31:44] down the line here yet the church
[1:31:47] remember if you was ever there Egypt
[1:31:50] span pyramid them stones weigh under in
[1:31:52] the sky weigh 100 tons so perfectly put
[1:31:55] together till the razor blade won't even
[1:31:57] fit between it hone to a perfect
[1:32:00] condition till it fits absolutely
[1:32:02] perfect without
[1:32:05] cement that's the way the church is
[1:32:07] going to have to
[1:32:11] be hone down the word honing the
[1:32:14] church
[1:32:16] discipline until when Christ comes to
[1:32:19] take the church the ministry that Church
[1:32:22] look the church will pick right up on it
[1:32:24] and will raise Luther Wesley Pentecost
[1:32:26] and go up in the Rapture to take the
[1:32:28] church
[1:32:30] up now let's just look at this chart
[1:32:33] real quick we've had it before with a
[1:32:35] lot of uh new ones hadn't seen this but
[1:32:38] this is kind of a a chart that we did to
[1:32:40] make sure we put everything together and
[1:32:42] we'll talk about that interval next
[1:32:44] time so you look at justification
[1:32:47] sanctification and the new birth that
[1:32:48] puts you in the body at Faith right
[1:32:50] everybody with me yes but now remember
[1:32:53] if you will read the book inter Veil
[1:32:56] which is in the 50s inter
[1:32:59] Veil brother Brown will take you the out
[1:33:01] of court inner Court holy of holies and
[1:33:03] then it seems like he brings you back
[1:33:04] out into the same court
[1:33:08] again so at being three stages of
[1:33:11] justification there's a there's a stage
[1:33:13] because brother R tells us and I think
[1:33:16] it
[1:33:17] was ah I can't remember I had to quote
[1:33:20] the other day
[1:33:22] where he talks
[1:33:24] about
[1:33:27] Justified I didn't do
[1:33:31] it I never done
[1:33:34] it then he continues on he said the real
[1:33:37] you never did
[1:33:39] it now see you don't understand that
[1:33:41] it's in your birth because you know the
[1:33:42] real you did it very fresh on your
[1:33:45] mind but through the word of God and
[1:33:48] what the
[1:33:49] honing we've come to a place to where
[1:33:52] we realize that the real me didn't do
[1:33:55] it that's what he said so so that
[1:33:59] justification has to come up higher into
[1:34:02] the Son of God Revelation which is
[1:34:04] through the church
[1:34:05] ages now that sanctification brother Ram
[1:34:08] you know we talk about um Paul says I
[1:34:10] Die daily well why do he need to Die
[1:34:12] daily if he's already born again that's
[1:34:15] right daily
[1:34:18] sanctification daily washing of the
[1:34:20] water of the world
[1:34:22] so that's what's happening in The Virtue
[1:34:23] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:34:25] and brotherly kindness in this stage of
[1:34:27] going up the
[1:34:28] pyramid we're trying to live a
[1:34:30] Sanctified life even better because
[1:34:33] remember this justification just cut off
[1:34:36] your past sins
[1:34:38] right this sanctification is the Luke
[1:34:41] where the unclean Spirit goes out comes
[1:34:43] back seeks rest findest none comes back
[1:34:47] cuz remember until here you're not B
[1:34:48] you're not sealed right you can stay
[1:34:51] right here for a long time and the devil
[1:34:53] can jump back on you and make you think
[1:34:54] you're religious he'll make you
[1:34:56] religious that's for sure but when you
[1:34:58] get to New Birth and get it sealed in
[1:35:00] then brother B said that's where you
[1:35:01] start at Faith then now you are an heir
[1:35:04] of God a baby see how this see these
[1:35:07] Shadows that Brothers put in here that's
[1:35:09] a b shadow of a baby that's your new
[1:35:11] birth but then you start again to
[1:35:14] where you say God forgive me not forgive
[1:35:18] me of that drink and smoking gambling I
[1:35:20] that ought went in
[1:35:23] sanctification but forgive me that I
[1:35:25] don't give you
[1:35:27] 100% forgive me that I don't discipline
[1:35:31] myself to give you everything I
[1:35:35] got and he's just to what forgive
[1:35:38] us we're going to need forgiveness right
[1:35:41] to the body change you said boy you
[1:35:42] talking about being perfect now you
[1:35:44] talk it's a
[1:35:47] paradox you can't help what goes in here
[1:35:50] but you can help what ST stays in there
[1:35:52] sanctification is the cleaning remember
[1:35:55] the dream sister Shepherd's dream
[1:35:57] remember where was she at she was
[1:35:59] standing right
[1:36:01] here at the new birth she was wondering
[1:36:03] about her birth read sh sister
[1:36:05] Shepherd's dream and blasphemous names
[1:36:08] she's standing right here now what did
[1:36:10] she see she saw a
[1:36:14] box that a man him was pouring water
[1:36:19] into this
[1:36:22] box right what was coming
[1:36:25] out
[1:36:27] trash you said oh I got rid on my TR no
[1:36:30] you did not you just realized you had
[1:36:32] trash right there amen you just realized
[1:36:35] you had
[1:36:36] trash you've been made aware your
[1:36:39] tutor and your Governor is saying hey
[1:36:42] there's more to this right let's go to
[1:36:44] the second grade third grade fourth
[1:36:46] grade let's get to this guy then get to
[1:36:48] this guy so he was pouring the water in
[1:36:51] the trash was what coming out running
[1:36:53] down the side over her feet showing that
[1:36:57] we still got trash so we need a daily
[1:37:00] sanctification to get rid of that
[1:37:03] trash and that's under the revelation of
[1:37:06] the Son of God but there is a special
[1:37:10] anointing that Holy Spirit is something
[1:37:11] special that many people are not going
[1:37:13] to be able to come
[1:37:15] to it's wonderful to feel the presence
[1:37:18] of God but when you feel the presence of
[1:37:20] God and you got Authority
[1:37:22] big
[1:37:23] difference big difference when God backs
[1:37:26] up what you said big
[1:37:29] difference that's showing maturity then
[1:37:32] we've got to see now as we continue
[1:37:34] through the statue of perfect man that
[1:37:36] there's three sons Nam Son of God Son of
[1:37:39] Man son of David Son of David's in the
[1:37:41] Millennium that's not to
[1:37:43] us but we got to get this right here
[1:37:46] right first we got to have the headstone
[1:37:49] brought back which is what the seals
[1:37:51] and that's the justification that the
[1:37:53] real you didn't do it that's the
[1:37:55] sanctification that I didn't do it I'm
[1:37:58] not it's not part of me and then we see
[1:38:02] the third one that anointing that that
[1:38:05] Holy Ghost is going to take us into
[1:38:07] Rapture everybody with me I hope you see
[1:38:09] that if you don't understand it uh
[1:38:11] please say something we brother Dale
[1:38:13] Drew this a long time ago so we're used
[1:38:15] to it but remember I I believe
[1:38:18] everything's done in
[1:38:19] stages everything everything's in stages
[1:38:22] your new births in stages your your
[1:38:24] growth development's in stages your your
[1:38:26] adoption is in
[1:38:29] stages I mean you think you just got
[1:38:31] Justified one time and that was it no
[1:38:34] we're humans you think you just got
[1:38:35] Sanctified one time no listen that's
[1:38:38] when you started having problems is when
[1:38:40] you got
[1:38:41] Sanctified that devil hated to leave
[1:38:43] your
[1:38:45] house remember God pleased to
[1:38:48] dwell the devil is too but they they
[1:38:51] both can't be in there at the same
[1:38:54] time but the son of man
[1:38:56] Ministry
[1:39:00] is let's just put it this way brother
[1:39:03] R's Ministry was in two parts he told us
[1:39:06] in the layout of see Church age brother
[1:39:07] George Quinn read it one of my most
[1:39:08] favorite quotes brother Brown said this
[1:39:10] message of Malachi for is to do two
[1:39:12] things right stay with me just for a
[1:39:13] second we'll close two things what one
[1:39:17] turn the hearts of of the children back
[1:39:19] to the fathers
[1:39:22] right all right and and then start your
[1:39:25] growth then the second part is to reveal
[1:39:29] the Thunders or the seals that was
[1:39:32] sealed up and he said it'll be these
[1:39:34] divinely reveal Myster truths that
[1:39:36] literally what literally change our body
[1:39:39] we've had a body change it started at
[1:39:41] the day that we got born again but
[1:39:43] you're going to stand one day and death
[1:39:45] going to climb up your sleeve and you're
[1:39:46] going to say
[1:39:48] uhuh no not today not tomorrow not the
[1:39:52] next day and then we going to step right
[1:39:54] over into eternity where the devil has
[1:39:57] never
[1:40:00] been we're going to go to a place that
[1:40:02] the devil has never been he's never been
[1:40:04] in eternity he's always been a time
[1:40:07] creature let's stand to our feet let's
[1:40:09] let's take communion you love the Lord
[1:40:12] amen but there's an interval that we got
[1:40:14] to talk about an interval means a period
[1:40:17] between two events or times and it's an
[1:40:19] amount of space all right and we'll look
[1:40:21] at
[1:40:24] that next time I preach whatever that
[1:40:26] whenever that
[1:40:29] is let's take
[1:40:42] communion all mind's
[1:40:44] clear you love the
[1:40:47] Lord then you got to love his
[1:40:49] people how do you love the Lord you love
[1:40:52] his people you love the Lord you love
[1:40:54] his
[1:40:56] people all right let's
[1:40:59] read if you want to pull it up there
[1:41:00] Brothers y'all can read with me for I
[1:41:03] have received of the Lord that which
[1:41:04] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:41:06] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:41:07] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:41:10] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:41:12] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:41:14] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:41:18] the same manner also he took the cup and
[1:41:20] when he had s saying this cup is the New
[1:41:23] Testament in my blood remember how do
[1:41:25] you get a testament there has to be a
[1:41:27] death of a testator all right so this
[1:41:29] new testament had to it required a
[1:41:33] death so he knew he was getting ready to
[1:41:35] die but he gave us an
[1:41:37] ordinance until he
[1:41:39] comes after the same manner he also took
[1:41:41] the cup which is up saying this cup is
[1:41:43] the New Testament in my blood not blood
[1:41:45] of bulls and goats not the
[1:41:47] law the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:51] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:41:53] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:41:55] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:41:57] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:42:01] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:42:03] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:42:06] unworthily all right you see
[1:42:08] unworthily are in an unworthy
[1:42:12] manner okay shall be guilty of the body
[1:42:14] in Blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:42:16] examine himself okay stop for a minute
[1:42:18] we're going to have a moment of silence
[1:42:19] here in just a few minutes examine
[1:42:23] yourself if you've done wrong or you
[1:42:25] need to get something done brother Brown
[1:42:27] said ask God to forgive you take
[1:42:29] communion but you better go get it right
[1:42:31] all right everybody with me okay but let
[1:42:35] a man examine himself and so let him eat
[1:42:36] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[1:42:39] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:42:41] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:42:45] not Discerning the Lord's body me and
[1:42:49] you right for this caused many are weak
[1:42:52] and sickly among you and many sleep but
[1:42:54] you see that one side of it but we've
[1:42:56] seen people healed by taking communion
[1:42:59] all
[1:43:00] right for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:43:04] should not be judged but when we are
[1:43:05] judged we are chasing of the Lord that
[1:43:08] we should not be condemned with the
[1:43:09] world thank God he separated us from the
[1:43:13] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:43:15] come together to eat t one for another
[1:43:17] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:43:19] home remember what they were doing they
[1:43:20] were just bringing a big Feast together
[1:43:21] and they were getting drunk and they
[1:43:23] were calling at the Lord's table that
[1:43:24] was the Corinthians they didn't
[1:43:25] understand they were kids children so
[1:43:28] Paul said it in order said hey if you're
[1:43:29] going to eat something eat at the house
[1:43:32] this is going to be Bread and Wine made
[1:43:35] by holy hands is going to be taken in
[1:43:37] other words pretty much in sorrow more
[1:43:39] than it is sitting having a big Feast
[1:43:41] with all the big Po poers and and you
[1:43:43] know lamb and all that stuff no that's
[1:43:45] not what this is
[1:43:47] about and if any man hunger let him eat
[1:43:50] at home that that you come not into unto
[1:43:52] condemnation the rest will I set in
[1:43:54] order when I come so let's have a moment
[1:43:56] of silence before we take communion
[1:43:59] praying for each
[1:44:15] other sanctify us now Lord and bless us
[1:44:18] in the furtherment of this service in
[1:44:20] Jesus name
[1:44:22] amen Bible said he took bread and
[1:44:24] blessed it dear heavenly father Lord
[1:44:26] this bread has been made Lord with just
[1:44:29] a couple of small
[1:44:30] ingredients Lord nothing added to it
[1:44:34] like the word should be father we pray
[1:44:36] that You' sanctify it Lord to our bodies
[1:44:39] and as we partake it Lord may we know
[1:44:41] that you were slain for us Lord and you
[1:44:44] died in your flesh Lord that we could
[1:44:46] have life father just bless it now in
[1:44:48] Jesus name amen
[1:45:02] you know when U Co
[1:45:05] hit and I'm sure they had them before
[1:45:07] but you know usually if something
[1:45:09] happens it Sparks you to do something
[1:45:11] you know or somebody to put something on
[1:45:12] the Internet so you know they they'd
[1:45:14] have these that you they deliver to your
[1:45:16] house and it'd be a cup of grape juice
[1:45:17] and it'd be a little old wafer sitting
[1:45:19] on top of it it's kind of like an inant
[1:45:20] communion thing you could get through
[1:45:22] Amazon or somebody you know but um they
[1:45:26] just don't get the real
[1:45:28] meaning I'd rather just wait and take it
[1:45:30] here amen I'd just rather wait and take
[1:45:32] cuz you know it was grape juice it
[1:45:33] wasn't wine they're not going to send
[1:45:35] alcohol through the through the uh post
[1:45:41] office but that's what they came up
[1:45:44] with and that's what they've come up
[1:45:46] with in years you know y'all know some
[1:45:49] of you had been here before for Mom and
[1:45:51] Dad used to be he was a deacon in the
[1:45:53] Baptist Church
[1:45:55] and she they' saved the she'd saved the
[1:45:58] little they'd be little wafers in a bag
[1:45:59] it'd be in a box like crackers almost
[1:46:02] like animal crackers you get out enough
[1:46:05] for that you knew people going to take
[1:46:06] it thought it out boy that was real
[1:46:08] fresh thought it out and what you didn't
[1:46:10] use you put it back in the little bag
[1:46:12] and put it in the freezer and used it
[1:46:13] for the next time we took communion and
[1:46:16] then Daddy would get to Welch's grape
[1:46:17] juice and he'd have to cut it for the
[1:46:19] Baptist you know a little bit so uh he
[1:46:23] but that's what they do they dilute the
[1:46:24] word of God they don't have a
[1:46:28] revelation uh sad to say but the
[1:46:30] Catholics have a little more Revelation
[1:46:31] on that than than they do at least just
[1:46:34] whine they ain't going to turn no wafer
[1:46:36] into the body I'll promise you
[1:46:42] that thank
[1:46:45] you dear heavenly father
[1:46:48] Lord this fruit of the Vine
[1:46:51] lord it's been made and now we really
[1:46:54] understand more about the process that
[1:46:55] it goes through that that it gets better
[1:46:58] and better Lord as it as it rots as we
[1:47:02] say and ferments Lord and you said if a
[1:47:04] corn of wheat dies and goes in the
[1:47:06] ground and abides alone it bring forth
[1:47:08] nothing but if it rots it brings forth
[1:47:11] more fruit Lord and I pray Lord today
[1:47:14] that as we partake of this communion
[1:47:16] that Lord we'll become better Christians
[1:47:18] that we'll become more of a servant for
[1:47:21] you father and that you'll bless us now
[1:47:23] in the ferment of this service in Jesus
[1:47:25] name
[1:47:28] amen come
[1:47:30] morning I walk by the
[1:47:35] river I'll rest neath the Ever Green
[1:47:42] Tree I will
[1:47:44] carry my cross through the
[1:47:49] midnight come morning there's glory for
[1:47:56] me sometimes I'm
[1:47:59] despised and rejected oh don't worry the
[1:48:02] world's not going to think anything
[1:48:03] about you and I wonder oh Father how
[1:48:10] long then I take one more look at Mount
[1:48:16] Calvary and it gives me the strength
[1:48:20] to go
[1:48:23] on come
[1:48:25] morning I walk by the river when I sing
[1:48:29] that song it's just so
[1:48:31] refreshing rest neath the
[1:48:35] evergreen
[1:48:38] tree I will
[1:48:40] carry my cross through the
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:46] midnight come
[1:48:48] morning there's Glory
[1:48:51] for
[1:48:54] me ain't it refreshing to know that you
[1:48:56] can
[1:48:58] rest we haven't rested since the day we
[1:49:00] were
[1:49:01] born it's been a struggle and a fight
[1:49:04] even though you might take a day or two
[1:49:06] off and rest brother Donnie you're not
[1:49:07] resting your mind's going a th000 miles
[1:49:09] an hour brother John you know that you
[1:49:11] know you try to take a little time off
[1:49:12] and you're
[1:49:13] still what's going on over there I need
[1:49:15] to be and I need to and what about one
[1:49:17] day when Tomorrow Never
[1:49:21] comes you ain't got to worry about
[1:49:23] what's going on tomorrow cuz ain't a
[1:49:26] tomorrow and you don't worry about what
[1:49:28] you didn't do yesterday cuz there's no
[1:49:30] yesterday it's just ever present we
[1:49:33] don't understand that we're creatures of
[1:49:34] time we always have been until I mean
[1:49:36] the day we were born they write down
[1:49:38] what time we were born right you were
[1:49:42] born at 1:02 a.m. and that's stuck with
[1:49:44] you the rest of your life it's what time
[1:49:46] you were born so we're still a creature
[1:49:47] of
[1:49:49] time but we need to start thinking a
[1:49:51] little bit about
[1:49:54] eternity and what that is that you will
[1:49:59] enjoy and we don't know what that we we
[1:50:02] Joy the Bible says joy for the moment
[1:50:04] well that's joy for the moment down here
[1:50:06] there's no joy for the moment up there
[1:50:07] cuz there's not a moment it's just Joy
[1:50:09] all the
[1:50:11] time you know we have good days and bad
[1:50:13] days you all of us do young old doesn't
[1:50:16] matter we all have good days and bad
[1:50:17] days but what about a time when that
[1:50:20] just levels
[1:50:22] out oh somebody ought to shout when that
[1:50:25] just levels out and you you don't have
[1:50:27] to go oh that used to not that used to
[1:50:30] not hurt when I got up no it'll never
[1:50:33] hurt again it'll
[1:50:36] never never hurt again you'll never have
[1:50:39] to go get new
[1:50:41] teeth or a new ankle or a new leg or a
[1:50:45] new
[1:50:47] uh-uh praise God you can eat what you
[1:50:49] want too probably won't even be any
[1:50:52] toothpaste or toothbrush over there
[1:50:53] either I wouldn't think so I hope not
[1:50:56] either I don't like brushing my teeth
[1:50:58] H H the Apple eating an apple cleans it
[1:51:02] out that's not happened in the garden
[1:51:03] though bro it didn't don't many eating
[1:51:08] apples but we don't fathom that we laugh
[1:51:10] about it because we've never come under
[1:51:12] that but we've got to start thinking
[1:51:13] that that God's already got this thing
[1:51:15] settled out for us he's got it planned
[1:51:18] you know just for a moment
[1:51:21] I love my wife and I love her with all
[1:51:22] my heart I don't know how in the world
[1:51:24] that love could be any stronger and the
[1:51:27] joy that we have together sure we have
[1:51:29] our tough times but the joy that we have
[1:51:31] together with each other it's
[1:51:33] uncomparable
[1:51:34] brother Ram said that wasn't even a
[1:51:38] speck wasn't even a DOT remember he said
[1:51:41] it started with a trickle he kept going
[1:51:43] down to just a flowing river well that's
[1:51:45] what it'll be you say I don't want to
[1:51:47] lose my wife I I'd like to have her for
[1:51:49] eternity you'll have her for eternity
[1:51:51] but you'll love her more but you know
[1:51:52] what you'll do you'll love your
[1:51:53] neighbors as much as you love her
[1:51:56] too right so that's the love of God that
[1:51:59] equals everything out man's love is what
[1:52:01] give us all these ups and downs and this
[1:52:03] I like you and don't like you I can't it
[1:52:07] greates my cheese when somebody says oh
[1:52:09] I really like that person well you know
[1:52:10] why you really like that person cuz
[1:52:11] theyve done something you
[1:52:13] like that ain't liking that just liking
[1:52:16] cuz Adam Ain I liked it but God always
[1:52:19] loved
[1:52:20] us he never did not love us if we're a
[1:52:23] child of his we've been a child of his
[1:52:25] from the foundation of the world and
[1:52:27] we're going back to that Eternal
[1:52:30] peace that was lost in the fall yes but
[1:52:34] we got to do this first let's
[1:52:48] partake thank you Lord let's read the
[1:52:51] scripture now for the for the foot
[1:52:56] washing of the S so like I said is part
[1:52:58] of the ordinance of of
[1:53:03] um of what we do until he
[1:53:05] comes so in John 13 He says and supper
[1:53:08] being ended the devil having now put
[1:53:10] into the heart of Judas his carot
[1:53:11] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[1:53:14] that the father had given all things
[1:53:16] into his hand and that he was come from
[1:53:17] God and went to God he red from supper
[1:53:20] and laid aside His Garment and took a
[1:53:21] towel and girded
[1:53:23] himself after that he pth water into a
[1:53:26] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:53:27] feet and to wiped them with a towel
[1:53:29] where withth he was girded then cometh
[1:53:32] he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto
[1:53:34] him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus
[1:53:36] said unto him what I do thou knowest not
[1:53:39] now in other words Peter hang on a
[1:53:40] minute have some
[1:53:42] patience and you'll know this when I
[1:53:45] leave and come back onto day of
[1:53:48] Pentecost what I do thou knowest not now
[1:53:51] but Thou shalt know
[1:53:54] Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt
[1:53:56] never wash my feet boy Peter here we go
[1:54:00] Jesus answered and said real plain he
[1:54:02] said Peter if you don't let me wash your
[1:54:05] feet you'll have no part with me now
[1:54:07] Peter got a revelation yet right there
[1:54:10] there was going to be a separation that
[1:54:11] he wasn't going to be able to get back
[1:54:13] to if he didn't do what he was talking
[1:54:14] what the master was
[1:54:16] saying cuz he says over here you call me
[1:54:18] master and Lord you say well for so I am
[1:54:20] all right so Peter said if I wash thee
[1:54:23] not thou has no part with me Simon Peter
[1:54:24] said unto the Lord not my feet only but
[1:54:26] also my hands and my head Jesus said
[1:54:29] unto him he that is washed neth not
[1:54:31] saved to wash his feet but is clean
[1:54:32] every with and you are clean but not all
[1:54:35] for he knew who should betray him
[1:54:37] therefore he said you are not all clean
[1:54:39] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:54:41] had taken His Garment was set down again
[1:54:43] he said unto them know you what I've
[1:54:44] done to you he's asking them a question
[1:54:47] a little question and answer session you
[1:54:50] call me master and Lord and you say well
[1:54:52] for so I am now look they told he told
[1:54:55] him not to say that in his journey in
[1:54:57] his time he said give honor to the
[1:54:59] father I'm no good don't don't give me
[1:55:02] it but he said right here he's getting
[1:55:03] ready to come to a place he said you
[1:55:05] call me master and Lord and you say well
[1:55:08] for so I am all right he's getting ready
[1:55:10] to leave if I then your master Lord and
[1:55:13] Master have washed your feet you also
[1:55:15] ought to wash one another's feet for I
[1:55:17] have given you an example that you
[1:55:19] should do as I have done to you verily
[1:55:22] verily I say unto you the servant is not
[1:55:24] greater than his Lord neither he that is
[1:55:26] sent greater than he that sent
[1:55:29] him if you know these things happy are
[1:55:32] you if you do them let's bow our heads
[1:55:35] heavenly father thank you for this day
[1:55:36] you've give us thank you for the Bride
[1:55:38] of Jesus Christ that stands before us
[1:55:39] today and Lord we've partaken of the
[1:55:42] communion Lord now we're going to the
[1:55:44] part of the foot washing Lord may we
