no sure I want to go I want to read I want to have one more scripture the kind of laid the foundation one may I will read a scripture out of Matthew Matthew the first chapter and I'm gonna begin reading first starting around verse 20 down through 25 maybe a little further than that but right now a very faint memory the first chapter starting at verse 20 if they make a pull it out real quick that be the first chapter starting at verse 20 the st. Matthew and then we want to deal about here because realized here I would you to know that name I want you to know what God was doing here got all those titles of his name hillo hollo title ha way back from the beginning odo title was getting closer and closer to flesh honey but Canada what was meant Canada but Canada although became Jesus afternoon so we begin to realize her naughty little revelation at the beginning I would you didn't know he'll he's gonna god they're invisible he meant he met him II mean informed they met him in many titles playing time to meet him who he really us how do we go to name recognition thority your catcher so thereby we go right here because this is a proper girl Kojo limit this time he did not have a revelation to who he was honey he was still in the Old Testament looking at the Old Testament God but he was coming from the Old Testament becoming a New Testament God so he goes here what you say what would the twenty verse of a god yeah he says while he thought only thing I beep up when I jumped up to four hello let me uh jump down to the nineteenth you had the 19 verses here that very long yesterday that's right and Joseph her husband being a just man you know what was Joseph's problem was he's a better judgment not willing to put her to to make her a public example but when a boy to put her away why we go she what testify I got a baby and I am pregnant by the Holy Ghost Joel didn't have such a revelation how do you jonah thinking man this young girl ain't tricking me I mean she took no crazy I've been around for them years I'll get rid of this girl but if I know she doesn't got pregnant he by me ain't gonna snow huh how do you don't worry never what they were thinking they were thinking that she were pregnant it was not bad Joe how you know how you know that they thought that because when Gina was dead if you know that when Gina with that what did they tell you we not be born of fornication holiday thought that Mary was pregnant by a Roman soldier but it will let you know even Joseph please know that I had the same thoughts how he had to tell you stop because until revelation revealed to you you in the natural realm he'll be rare revelation if we put us in the supernatural how do you show we think natural until revelation come how did that one you can no man can call Jesus the Christ without the Holy Ghost hello idiot say now Olivia he gonna think that what we always get messed up baby by the way we always think it oh you're trying to put it together and we'll try to figure this message out no you don't need to figured out you need to believe and if we wish you believe it in God get a revelation help you but he got the first thing you got to do and get you to believe the revelation of the word honey so he said but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him a person of illusion a person who praise God highly they were hit appeared unto him unto him in a dream and said Joseph the son of wool right gene that right roots the routing of rina David he was in the right route for not to take a D Mary thy wife it would because we were being friend Undertaker named Mary that way for that would you consider her is all the one hallelujah everywhere so now he's brain in Jogja her Joker was questioned he kept he said what was wrong all he had to do was look at the scriptures as they all had already prophesied a virgin will be with child it's easier to believe with it how it is easy for you to plead that I can't believe you're a virgin she could be with child but when they become your wife that was a problem coming it was reasonably hallelujah I can't do your back and run away would have been that anyway baby shot I believe that but you got pretty if they just holy go now it changes how do you human reasoning drop here how do we go here a little pickled a in the natural and only way to see God is in the supernatural Holly show heywhat dangled in he says him and he goes now watch what he do here between the first verse yeah and she shall bring forth a what and I shall call his name that's your call his name honey and then they shall be called Jesus for he shall save his people from their sin I want you to notice this right honey I don't care you know where brother Joel I believe in ji-ho that's all right I believe in the Casimir Holly not breathing mighty God I believe I will let you know sure God did not call Ella he'll he didn't I call but Canada he called Jesus's hey Polly changed his name he received a new name and it was Jesus hello and then he goes on to say and now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying a virgin shall be with child the word went out the spoken word was smoking all he could not come through a sexual or denier here to come through the smoker so a probably smoked the word and he would materialize it around Papa see her heels coming a virgin shall be with child brave boy they saw and I shall call his name what did they change no they didn't change let me put away below and I shall call his name Emmanuel which he'll be turbulent my god above but God scattered her with her hallelujah st. John 1:14 to be revealed so they're gonna say now Josie boy man I bet we've seen this revelation boy he was he was I think I might be right there and it was so I want you to know I should call his name Emmanuel how do you Emmanuel the interpretation was it interpreted the name for you it don't change him it just brain wave or imposition we place it way for to me his name shall be called manual by interpretation God stand here Oh mother how did that is his name how did Jesus in other word you said brother Joe why you're teaching on it I'm going to tell what made me got on the subject but the team was in Africa some time back in a certain point and he was dating a baptism surgeon took place and why he was dead they say i baptize you in the name of the lord will branding that is adultery teaching powell's that i didn't die for your sins Oh Paula Deen devil you're seeing Jesus Christ someone died for your sin and you must get a revelation I want public don't look at me but look - Gina natok didn't to finish your your face he'll lose hope now we begin to look at this day right so I thought that what got me stirred up about this so now we begin to look at his name how we want to deal with the name of it how long would you read a quote for Christ a mystery God revealed he says here at page 23 he said because he had to experience see he was a savior he had to express that and he how could he do it only through Christ how could he be a certain only through Christ how could he be a Hiller only through Christ see all day they'd wind up in that one person Jesus crying not people call he said that one approach that people call Jesus a genie they don't get an idea because his name and rebuilding the Thunder which is the divine mission that lays in his word his name is just a one his name is a character and a person with Jesus Christ I'm gonna let you notice here when when he opened up the revelation to Joseph Holly what didn't new he broke me he broke the supernatural mystery he reveals something that was supernatural it had never been done before he broke the seals to Joseph Palomino it was sealed in Georgia he rented in Isaiah he know what I said but he could not see the mystery until God in the water you cannot see Christ into God interpreter word highly people I don't get you said brother how would I know he's here Holly you'll know him here you would know he's her by the revelation of his worry dude I mean take this here literally look at this Lacan says so now we begin to go to here so now brother who what you trying to do what it is today I say today what we have done in the message I begin to rely we have got people set a message but we haven't got them to Christ and you know we don't actually you believe Jesus we say do you believe the message how do you they don't even got a revelation would a message else hey will you say - do you beat imagine first day they say y'all believe brother Brantley but brother burn and believe Jesus how can brother Eddie say believe me if they believe him I need like the people get over how when you think of the message first thing you think about I believe the Prophet hug that's good you breathing but do you believe his message who you believe in The Guardian preach about I'm not Ted I'm the brother he come to lift up one man ain't never Jesus Christ the same yesterday today will well you go back to the Bible upon him preach they come to lift up Jesus Christ in a word he said brother Joel you said what did he say I wouldn't let you know what would matter can't afford to do that returned on horseback to what not back till along but back to Christ they love Christ they put him on the outside of the church they forgot about that first love it was Jesus they put out that's right brother word let me just throw this in so you know you said bro you you're pretty excited me yeah I'm pretty excited because I realize hardly because even myself approaching people and I have pro people wrong over the year and I had told people thing that I said the way I protein it were completely wrong because I told him even if you don't be the proper you you're not gonna make it I should have told him if you don't accept the Christ that he preached you're not gonna make it because he pointed out the Jesus anytime to put the people back at what he was boarding this - he said Jesus Christ is the same he did the same yesterday today and Bella you either one got caught up no one we got all the deals you wish you were running to Mister today everybody waiting on brother Brendan to come back holiday about we doing something how have one but I'm just in the church he said when the seals open when brother Brad come back and open the seals don't even know who to seal this Christ's hands the sails when you receive it holy ghost you are sealed hello to the date of your Redemption what you looking for the ceiling in the Holy Ghost but we make a step mysterious how do I wait to try it they're probably gotta come back so I could get the holy go baby will you leave a word for your day the Christ of the New Testament the Christ the same yesterday today makes definitely your heart you'll receive the holy go what is the rapture a little bit but in the rapture everybody in the made that mysterious - you gotta get some man razor you gotta see the seven thunders the seven thunders interruption oh you gotta see the parousia you got to see the Sun manatees rapture but my father telling me one day my Bible say when you receive Christ you receive the same spirit that raised him from the dead if the same spirit that was there cried dwell you you had a little brain your body canis a revelation of a change will you recite only go who got to rapture hey let me take this a little step for that and I could be able to be real long tonight but I thought easy so we want to we want to deal with something that Jesus say at one time you know Jesus with his disciples and he says these words to him he says they will rejoice it because they had power over demons now I be that we got power over demons but anything what got us rejoicing Plus Rajasa t because we know who we are have when you know who you are you you know where you go Helen so that's what you were never what make us will get happy to read your because we know what we come from what we going hallowed out what make us get happy Holly don't worry you know so here they come back Deborah Johnson I mean it was they were havin church and power gobble moving but judy was moving right with him he was the same revalidate heaven but Jesus do not rejoice because you got power and Devils but rejoice because your name is written in heaven so what is the name of heaven he's an old Samuel Earth his name Jesus and the family heaven in Jesus no revelation who you are it's reflected in heaven okay now let us look at this name you realize here if your name was not written in heaven the Bible say revelation 13:8 say everybody named is not written out it's gonna worship the Beast so blessed are your girls how do you go God and turn your heart back to the word Holly oh yes we could have been caught up and we could have been going to church every religious washer and don't even know who he is they worship God you don't even know what it wants you but did Jesus tell a woman at the where they don't even know who they worship but we got a revelation that God is the same yesterday today hallelujah circled and says this word he said go your name is your name with if you didn't know who you was and you're in a word if your name wouldn't have been in the Lamb's Book of Life if your name wouldn't have been written in heaven then you were automatic worship the Beast hallelujah because every one name that was not found written in the lamb but the life one and worship the Beast how do you know the word what you say but I'm not gonna go in Washington but we are watching something even if we had to make this message or call oh oh maybe I shouldn't say there well you had everyone saying that's what a lot of people have made it Holly and will let you know right now the first the first winner his story begins with the worship of a man and started with the worship of a man that 70 weeks a day and they're gonna end with the same spirit and falling in the chapter that they don't even know who Jesus is the day anyway people trying to feel if I read the message I guess we got people been reading the mention but Europe they come in the doctor running on with people wife they never had the Holy Ghost oh man let us say did look at this name written in heaven the name is written in heaven how do you say brother Joe it got to be some substance so I wouldn't know my name is in heaven Holly you've gotta help some substance how do you say how do I know my name is heaven can you receive revelation blessed all your eros hey you know he that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit say everybody gave hear the word how many people go to church with natural herbs and never heard a word but we your hands Lord it changes your nature will you heard a word they give you a new creation look him with Jesus say to a disciple he actually decided us a common quest we actually probably every by the court description it's not nothing mysterious who the man say that I am the question would left him who would a man say that what

holy he know when the trial come you got to know that eyes a hole in the time of the storm I'm not disturbed but what's happening people say all but people don't love dimension over the cloud people that left the message over there he's a brother that card brother Brandon with Nell Holly I don't believe it no more than only as I said people ain't got time for their holy that I know the adjourn was on Alabama he looked all the way in my day it wrote about what we saw that they need to be there because the revelation not a physical thing don't try to make it physical something supernatural I mean physicists uh but watch this here I'll talk about being moon look you know religious won't hold you now do you know we got religion around mystical I dress right every danger ain't like the rest of them people but you make a good Pharisee you judging people by the way you already you make a good person well that'd be I will let you know that one sister back that she still wearing eerie and brother Sam blood I'm saying so what are you looking at the wrong name we ought to be bread there's God begin to reveal this revelation to us nowhere don't worry know how to clean a fish how do we know why trying to clean it you take this off you take that off now we don't reform and get robox we got a row boxes in the church no I mean come on get a life man let the Holy Ghost you to work you preach the word the Holy Ghost clean the church up on the screen either I'm gonna straighten that brother brother long to be smoking cigarette let God keep preaching there let it keep raining this amen to the word watch the only gonna take over right this is not a rehab this is not a rehab put it down and pick it back up let God come in one time you put it down are you free I don't even know where that comes from never name notes hey Lisa but look here then they live to deal with this religious spirit what just what this rich young ruler perfect tight cuz he had ever good work that was required for a person that's under the law yes that's it if he would have died before he met Jesus he was on his way to him he was on his way to heaven come for his human knowledge when he did everything that he thought was right he did he really did what he said when Jesus actually request me he went just telling a lie he's had done anything from my youth right so he would really be an unassisted call he thought in his heart man my slate is clean so he came to Jesus and here you're just talking to Jesus and he says he says good master what can I do didn't hurt in her eternal life and first I'll he comes good Jesus said there's none good but the father you said what Jesus didn't have no sin yet but he returned you're saying you're seeing once again it was that don't you worry I don't care you're seeing today okay you're seeing to the death okay your sins the hell not my sin your sins so he point him back to the revelation if there's none good but the father then he goes on and says what can I do all right we got one question here that's what's wrong today everybody think I'm gonna do something good enough to make heaven hey hey but you don't know how many times I say God I don't care about that God is not concerned about how much you do well look what we done done live here helllooo dealt with the church a bit people said true well I'll be able to do surgery here I done done this and I've been doing that so what you know get brownie points with God this is not a contract this is salvation maybe give me of God if you do this I do that no you don't do that with God you submit yourself and let God take over but he says what can I do it in her to eternal life Jesus all right simple just keep the commandments I should not steal gosh it's not like that I have no Word of God - should not you know it so the young man he he immediately went through his spiritual computer thinking and I turned all that all my life I'm gonna be a pretty good fella maybe would you say I've done it for my I was raising the message like my daddy was in Moses revival you know how to use her my mammy you don't know my great-grandfather was with Moses did he tell you your great-grandfather see everyone with Moses he never crossed over honey when they come out of your nose when they come over in the Promised Land Holly they come in the New Testament they never quoted Joshua they called Abraham and they caught him oh they were still under law Joshua get him over and position a place them in the word so you go to says here Jesus a where all right you say you kept all the commandments so if you kept all the commandments then I don't need to die for the world cuz you're perfect in other words if I'm with in that way if you kept all the commandments I don't need to die you already perfect how do you know why do you need a sacrifice you can do it on your left honey but he said well I will let you know right now I'm unconsciously to you or your son aren't you you're on a world that you about a religious devil oh brother you should know Jesus a huh you want to be set free I'm gonna tell when I deliver you from that demon that got you about that brother damn day they say I'm more sensitive nerve in a man like that wallet it might not look like you but it was a problem that God Jesus can see his love for his wallet for his chain for eternal life what will a man give were so hallelujah hey Jesus say all right you think if you want eternal life take your wallet give it to the poor he said man you out of your mind I'm giving man well how could he say kept all the commandments when he got something he loved more than her life halu so it showed up that was in him he was about he wouldn't have never been lost if he wouldn't have never come across and you wouldn't never be lost and we wouldn't have had a row elation to come to introduce us back to Jesus and we said I don't want to go there trying to bleed it so it so got the messenger do this run over your preacher perusing Deborah no it ain't about man hey buddy Superman raise up it's over wit it's you in Christ now no Superman is Christ so would you know him so he rejected Jesus and probably gone the only way he could be saying it through Jesus because Noah he was sick the same man from that sickness that was the purpose we don't forgot what their purpose was heli everything else if we look at so revelaed we forgot why did Jesus come why do we call him the name of Jesus because he's the only way if you could believe and confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that should be saying you know what a name they can do that but Jesus came hello so now we look at me do things right here I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna throw a few other things in here prepares you I want you to notice here I'm gonna lay because probably guy use this inch if you won't think of preaching something either out of the wall go back and look at a god prevent God chosen place of worship he lays it out hallelujah I'm listening no way down here he said who's first Colossians 3:17 I'll just read you regret which ever whatsoever ye do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him hallelujah Network who serves you did I read Romans I just quoted Romans 10 brother the 13th I wish ever call upon the name I call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how shall they call without a tape recorder and one thing about you said well I brought you a table called here preaching yeah but they don't got feets it don't got feet so don't try to use it on me how do you learn well sure in the word Sunday you know why did Paul killed him when he come up when he come up did a book evident had you received or they go sis do you believe here they was heaven Church without the Holy Ghost here people been in the midst we got the whole ego they still falling in adultery still going out doing things in the world and they say I've been in the middle for thirty years you never got sealed because if you get the person of Jesus which is the revelation that is meted you will become a new creation go insane any man in Christ is a new creation old things have passed away and all things become new you say you're trying to make it an uber from get ready tell you in the scripture in the message I will use your new birth but it says here and they say we have not received he that we know not he did he say we know not that be a Holy Ghost and then then what did he tell him they had to do what the Bible said in it they could not receive the Holy Ghost until they receive the revelation of his name and go get baptized lay hands on the body and all of a sudden it was filled with the Holy Ghost people this is revelation is more than just a book the Bible is no good without the person being it that says you see the person in the Bible you got letters but when the Bible become a new book you see Christ in you how do so now I'm gonna use just from here I think just I'm gonna just maybe kind of winding this from kind of like a closing but I mean like I say the new birth I need to eat that real good I need to hit that real good because people thinking I'm getting born again just because I I got a message book in my hand I got a tape in my house that's good we should play the tapes we should heard a message but we also need to ask God by revelation the givers over experience with the baptism of the holy gold which is the person described in you so I could take out the thrill of being lost you know there's one thing we all battle with it's not gonna be good enough when Arabica I doubt it I doubt it very serious but the person that's in you is good enough honey the person to see you if I you know you did me because you heard a night in church it's a lot of pleasure you couldn't be but something on the inside or deep keep pulling you back you try I would not go come tonight I didn't feel like coming tonight but some huh that's him tonight I was sick but I really in a way that's the Holy Ghost again we use this one right here and I'm going to use one more scripture example he's a Brit Julie you're pretty sure if you take in 20 minutes and get a revelation what was saying you have enough to make a rapture how do you if you could take and receive the Holy Spirit and get enough of you how do you accept what he doing you can make a rapture he said he goes a page at 36 of the crisis that mister God reveal Satan hate that book this was right here you might not realize when brother Antichrist and mister God revealed he took them all and included in this one powerful message Holly he you you go back to reheat covers every day the aimed aid the severs everything he covered everything in it in this one book crisis to mister God revealed what do we bring you back to back to the said I said what is a new birth dean it was a question that is a question what is the new birth well you know we feel like well the new birth fields I've been in the message for years my grandfather was in brother branding meeting since that's my I know I'm not saying I was dead when brother Brendan did this I would that don't save you that don't say because she was there what save you is when you got a revelation who heals what is the new birth you say what you say what brother Brandon what is the new birth he put it up praise God 22:35 if what is the new better Dean you said well brother Brannon what is the new birth what let's read this it is - what a whoa this just says simple simple personally to you just like your wife you know who she is if you don't know who she is you get the wrong I mean you know nobody you said it look at your wife's a banker but I think her name so so I think I think he'll go Broadway said you know I'm trying to tell him his wife named Joanne it could be a problem Wego tell me you've got the wrong woman this is June you can't change the man revelation once it's been revealed to me honey you don't read the message ain't real to people how do you know what you know when you said why they real to be revealed to me I'm gonna Bride of Christ that was wrong you the bride but I'm gonna skip a little fun in being a bride I'm the wife the wife war know her mate she don't want no wheel not his bride let me and say this here let me just use him I'm gonna close out with this one now I want you to notice him could we look at things here if your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life the question always being can I be disqualified it's no way if you could be disqualified then God would had had to sin Paul scraped the hill Paul would have had to go straight to hell now we're gonna stand in here and show you did not would you look at now what she knows I want you to look at two men's that was both Paul he was persecuting the church killing Judas he was with the church but he still was a murder he sold Jesus out a religious demon he was undeterred the revival of Jesus and he sold him out for thirty pieces of silver haloo to make popularity to make merchants out of the message I'll leave that long everybody tried to sell the message now halu you know three people okay well glad I got it in me so I don't have to buy I got the pizza Jimmy honey you know but here we are you get every day you can't people I'm gonna let you know I'm not saying this in a humble way believe it or not to my and this is not just an I can't use the computer I mean I'm sorry my wife said you need to learn how to use the computer why would I need the computer for I got the old goose he told me he'll bring all their you to my remembrance but I do need to get quotes board up so I got a favorite brothers like my brother uh move back to in job Russ Joe he pulled up something need tonight because I didn't know how to do it but thank you brother Joe god bless you honey if you can't do it again somebody do it how the old man tell me what I'm saying if you got a big news if you don't know how to run the business how a man that can do it baby so doesn't say that so let you go what I'm trying to say people this revelation is not given by my knowledge you got it's given by the person you know that nobody can't separate you from it I'll be in other words something that's in you that's unmovable doctor treated planted by the rivers of water I shall not be moved he like me in a tree or rock but it planted the right way in angle move so there was something to get let me finish the power I didn't we dispersed you don't Evelyn but up all your Paul and Judas now watch Judas why did Judas go to hell he had a rich my better life than Paul cuz he was on a more powerful influence in Paul Paul was under the in the way Judas was with Jesus and why didn't you to sell Jesus out for politics for religious power and money why did Paul crucify the church you know why Paul Cruz my judge he was still under the law he would do what the law required him to do so what he was he was doing it and he would believe it in his heart that I am doing and they blasphemers against Moses message I'm getting rid of that what he would do he was under the law so he'll go judas under grace following the messenger hell and he's selling out he'll go Paul under the world I'm in a religious spirit of the law had never met Jesus so what he doing the what he done he disqualified himself from the scripture everybody he he hated the church he hated the name of Jesus because he didn't believe in the name of Jesus he believed in the Lord guy he believed in G over he know although titles he believed in no titles of the Old Testament Holly show here he was he goes he'll go he'll go poke believing it so he hated the name of Jesus he was going into myself to get a warrant if I can't anybody baptize it or preaching in that name I'm killing him if I don't kill him I'm putting him in jail I don't care if it's a woman boy girl that's how much he hated the Jesus and then he not only did he do that he turns around and he kills a man that's full of the Holy Ghost which according to my Bible say Chuck not minority do my prophets no harm it's better for meals star to be tied around your neck and you up thrown into the depth of the sea and you touch one of mine or the one he killed a man full of the Holy go totally disqualified himself he said I passing they don't look good one but if he would have stayed on the Lord wouldn't have been good but as he was on his way down to Damascus Hollywood that demon I'll hate the demon or legalism how do I want to persecute that lead at Church of God how do you know where he was he had made up in my soul he was gay he was going on his Road and all of us suddenly a big bright light come around Paul Paul being a student of the scripture and knowing what the pill of our he what that pill if I was he knew the pillar fire so now he wanted to know his name he wanted to know his name cause the question is who are you lord help that's all he knew was lower god from the book of Genesis he knew he was the Lord God he knew he was there with him he knew he was Jill who are you lord and that pill of I says I am Jesus I come from God and I went back to God I am Jesus but when he heard the word it changes nature well you whatever you want me to do I do it Lord so that's how you in we do it in the world God look at your worldly life you come out oh you heard Jesus it turned you from the world back to him how do we really go crazy that's all right brother thank you Jesus how did that make a good Jesus become a different way we live that were legitimately one more thing and the musicians get ready to come that why Paul could write with inspiration the book of Romans 8 nobody came to talk about predestination like Paul man you know you were going to hell and God give you a revelation I made it how do you bro you know Hollywood something you get a revelation with the blood done for you see the reader we can't get above that they too many people still under their gloom of the past wowsie wowsie will I did this when I was just an underling this and I got so many things against me you know why so issue because you ain't accepted Jesus once you accept Jesus he take your seats I didn't drop it in the silver forgiven it Halloween look I pass all your illness when you shoot that with the hair god I can't even see it how can you judge something you can't see people good but the point of it we won't let it die the dead body of incurring this dead body for 20 years I became the dead body every time you see hallelujah I'm all we on the condemnation I ain't no happy cuz I got married when I was in the were not done all these like I can't be say okay people you have you bleed it have you got help you how do you gotta throw your cell phonee hope to god then lord i except your mercy that devil tried me but i know your grace is for me lord [Applause] it'll give you a chance to willfully go do it by the way i have to show you you don't let the devil put a weight over you we all was seeing through illness how many's your I'm blasting don't use the Lord's name in vain don't ever raise your hand but God knew he was that's why the blood of Jesus Christ he did away with every day hallelujah another where you told his sinners in him so let me go and finish this I was appalled all the things he did he would totally disqualified but when he met Jesus it changed everything it changed his language him it changed his trend of thinking it trained the way he talked the way he walked the way he lived little if they get Romans 8 musicians come on back on read this one Romans 8 and I want to begin reading Paul testimony Romans 8 no one read ok praise God let it look at Romans 8 I'm going to beginning at 35 all the way down through 39 let it look at Paul testimony he'll go Paul healer met Jesus he didn't met what God did but you know when you got these things don't you Paul had to deal with weights in his spirit - he had to drop off - how do you think Paul deal with knowing he kills Stevenson fully the Holy Ghost but Paul finally come to Revelation What did he say I got a forget to obey this behind how can you undo what you already is in the past let the pack bury the past I'm in Christ hey Christ has no past that would make right perfect he can you know we can look back and say when my granddaddy did this well God live with Christ look back easy I come from God said that was my helper reading hell no bad we got a pass Holly but with near blood of Jesus when you accept Christ you have no passion and if you have a path because you ain't fully accept with the blood done for you and a pardon ain't a party until you accept what Paul says his word watch how you break this love now who shall separate whoa you've been reading it all the time and you never saw your name you never saw your name in the Bible are the holy years you been reading the same scripture who should separate way whoo-hoo with us and Jew who's just separate you I can't go things that if I would bring up a past God would open up the cameras of heaven and say D done this I would walk out of here

sake we are killed Oh Dale Oh counted as sheep from the flock all day long my mind is devil's fighting hell you cuss to hit in the world and demons fighting here every day and your mind going through
